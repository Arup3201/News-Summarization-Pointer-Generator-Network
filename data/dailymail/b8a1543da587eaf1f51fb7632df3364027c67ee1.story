House Republicans took a symbolic vote today to impede President Barack Obama from using executive actions to 'exempt' categories of illegal immigrants from deportation.

The House voted 219-197 to approve the legislation authored by Florida Rep. Ted Yoho. At a press conference before the vote, House Speaker John Boehner said the lower chamber would pass the bill to make it clear to Obama it was 'rejecting his unilateral actions.'

While it's success was assured in the GOP-run chamber, it has no chance of seeing daylight in the Democratically-controlled Senate.

House GOP leadership offered the vote as a consolation prize to their right-wing counterparts in Congress who want to use a critical spending bill as a cudgel against the Democratic president.

'This course of action is based on numerous conversations with our members,' House Speaker John Boehner said today of the GOP's current strategy to take on the president while funding the government, adding that he too thinks it's the best plan

As soon as the votes were tallied this afternoon Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, as predicted, that he would not take up the House's bill to restrict Obama's actions. 

'Unfortunately for anyone who wants to see Congress fix our broken immigration system, the Republican approach is being dictated by the most extreme voices in their party,' Reid said in a statement.

'Republicans’ knee-jerk resistance to working with Democrats to fix this problem left the President with no option but to take action to protect families from being separated.'

Reid encouraged Republicans to 'put aside their partisan political games' and instead 'focus their efforts on passing a permanent, common-sense solution to fix our broken immigration.' 

With just four work days left until Congress lets out until early January, and a Dec. 11 deadline to extend  government funding or shut its doors, comprehensive immigration reform is nowhere near the top of Republicans' year-end to-do list.

Fearing a government shutdown just as the current legislative session comes to a close ahead of the holidays, establishment Republicans are asking conservatives to wait until after the party takes control of the Senate next year to brawl with the president.

Instead, they plan to proceed with a continuing resolution to fund the entire government except the Department of Homeland Security through the end of the current fiscal year. 

The immigration management agency would only be funded through the first quarter of 2015. At that time, Republicans would have the opportunity to push through an appropriations bill with more teeth.

On Capitol Hill the legislation is creatively being referred to as the CRomnibus - a combination of CR, the shortened version of continuing resolution, and omnibus, a term to describe an overarching spending bill.

Boehner said today that the the spending bill would allow the GOP to keep the government open while 'keeping our leverage' so that when they get 'reinforcements' in the Senate in January they can take on Obama.

'This course of action was based on numerous conversations with our members, and I frankly think it gives us the best chance for success,' Boehner told reporters.

'We think this is the most practical way to fight the president's action,' he said minutes later, noting again that leadership had extensive talks with members of it's caucus before going down this path.

'We listened to some members who were frankly griping the most,' he said. 'This was their idea of how to proceed.'

But conservatives in Congress have vocally argued that by March of next year, when funding for DHS would run out under the current plan, the president will have already begun to issue work permits and green cards to as many as 5 million immigrants. 

Therefore, prohibitive legislation must be passed as soon as possible, they say, preferably just after the new Congress convenes in January.

'The president is already printing work permits as we speak. Why do we want to give him another 2-3 months? We could vote on this the day we get back,' Louisiana Rep. John Fleming told Breitbart news earlier this week.

Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the ranking member on the Senate Budget committee, exploded on House leadership on Tuesday evening in a statement, arguing that they were reneging on Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus' promise that the party would do 'everything we can' to stop Obama's directives from taking effect. 

'Unfortunately, the plan now being circulated in the House fails to meet that test,' Sessions said. 

'The executive amnesty language is substantially weaker than the language the House adopted this summer, and does not reject the central tenets of the President’s plan: work permits, Social Security, and Medicare to 5 million illegal immigrants—reducing wages, jobs, and benefits for Americans,' he added.

Sessions claimed that Obama is demanding that 'Congress fund his imperial decree and declare its own irrelevance.'

'That is why Congress must respond to the President’s unlawful action by funding the government but not funding illegal amnesty,' he said. 

'Such a plan would put the focus where it belongs: on Senate Democrats. They are the ones who should be made to choose sides—save Obama’s amnesty or save Americans’ jobs and borders.'

In a statement sent out the same night Louisiana Sen. David Vitter blasted his colleagues in the House for caving to Reid before they even took a vote on conservatives' preferred legislation. 

'Make no mistake, sending a bill to the Senate without first making an attempt to include defund language is telling the American people that you support Obama’s executive amnesty,' he said. 'That would be a slap in the face to the voters who sent a message last month by electing Republican majorities in Congress.'

Retiring Congresswoman Michele Bachmann of Minnesota made a similar point on Wednesday during a press conference with Iowa Rep. Steve King and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

'Will we be a people who decide that we are going to go with the freight train of what Washington, D.C., wants or will we listen and harken to the voice of the American people that was stated unmistakingly on Nov. 4?'  Bachmann said, according to the National Journal.

Cruz told Republicans who ran on their opposition to unilateral immigration in their recent campaigns 'do what you said you would do.'

'Doing what you promise doesn't mean, as it so often does in Washington, sending a really stern letter and having a meaningless show vote. Why do you think people are so frustrated with Washington? Because they recognize there are a whole lot of politicians who say one thing at home and do something different here,' Cruz said. 

Senator Ted Cruz  speaks to the press about the need 'To Defund the President's Executive, Unconstitutional Amnesty' on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday with Reps. Steve King, left, and Michele Bachmann, right. Cruz told Republicans who ran for reelection on their opposition to unilateral immigration in their recent campaigns 'do what you said you would do'

The probable 2016 presidential candidate warned that 'the same folks who are saying, "Gosh, we cannot do anything now," are the same folks who in January are going to say, "Gosh, we don't have 60 votes in the Senate." '

'It's like Charlie Brown and Lucy where consistently the same voices pull the football aside and say, "You know what, you can never ever ever do anything to stop a lawless president," ' he contended.

Even after Republicans ascend to the majority in the Senate, they will still be at least six votes shy of being able to overcome a Democratic filibuster on prized legislation, unless incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decides to adopt the so-called 'nuclear option' of governing that allows bills to advance with a simple majority of votes.

When Reid introduced the nuclear option, McConnell and other Republican legislators railed against it. But now that it's their turn in the driver's seat, they're considering making it part of their lawmaking practices, as well.

In the meantime, conservative hardliners are hoping they can still convince their caucus to vote down the plan currently under consideration by the House, paving the way for one that funds DHS for a shorter time period to come to the floor. 

'I’m probably leaning no [on the current House plan],' North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows told Politico on Tuesday night. 

'I think in terms of the CR omnibus, without a limitation language, there are not enough votes. I’m not on the whip team but listening to a number of my colleagues, there is more than enough concern.' 

If the short-term legislation funding Homeland Security through March does pass in the House, Reid has committed to bringing it for a vote in the upper chamber, calling the potential deal a 'big accomplishment' on Tuesday.

'The American people certainly will not want to face another year being governed by crisis,' Reid said. 'No one wants the kind of cliffhanger fights we’ve had again and again in recent years.'

Boehner told reporters today, 'I expect that we'll have bipartisan support to pass the omnimbus spending bill.'

Yoho said this week he was satisfied, for now, that his own legislation to reign in the president's authority would be given its day in the House.

'My hat's off to the leadership,' Yoho, an ally of conservative lawmakers, told the National Journal. 'I commend leadership for saying, 'You know what, this sounds like a commonsense bill.'
