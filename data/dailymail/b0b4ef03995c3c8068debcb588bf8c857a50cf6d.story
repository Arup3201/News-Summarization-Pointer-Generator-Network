Burnley manager Sean Dyche has attempted to protect out-of-sorts striker Danny Ings by calling on the rest of his team-mates to share the goalscoring burden to keep the team in the Premier League.

Ings, strongly linked with a move to Manchester United or Liverpool when his contract at Turf Moor runs out in the summer, hasn't scored since February 11 — a run of eight matches — and missed his side's best chance in Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Everton that left Burnley bottom.

As a team, they have scored just one goal in their last seven matches and while Dyche needs 23-year-old Ings to rediscover his mojo quickly, starting with the critical home game against relegation rivals Leicester City, he insists it's unfair to pin the club's survival hopes on one man.

'Yes, Danny needs to find his goal touch but it's not just him. You want everyone and anyone to score. Boydy (George Boyde) has got goals, Scott Arfield's chipped in. David Jones had a great chance against Everton so the whole team has to step up to the plate.

'I'd be questioning us more if we weren't creating chances but we have been creating. It's rare at this level that you see a whole plethora of chances, say 15 or 20 like you see in other leagues, so when your chances come you have to take them.'

Ings was mentioned in the same breath as Harry Kane not so long ago but you could see a lack of confidence as he misdirected a header from a Kieran Trippier cross in the closing minutes.

It is 43 months since Everton last lost a 3pm Saturday home game, a 1-0 defeat against QPR which marked Tony Fernandes' first match in charge as the visitors' new owner.

Everton won the game with a first-half goal from Kevin Mirallas who was later fortunate not to become the second player to be dismissed by referee Mike Jones when he caught Boyd on the shin. Burnley's Ashley Barnes had earlier been sent off for two bookable challenges, a decision Dyche had no complaints about.

Everton's stand-out performer was winger Aaron Lennon who has impressed since a January loan move from Tottenham. Even so, manager Roberto Martinez insists there are no plans at this stage to sign him on a permanent basis.

'With all honesty, we are not going to think about that situation until the season is over,' said Martinez.

'When you have a loan player it is always a three-way conversation. The player is the first one that needs to make a decision and the parent club has a big say. I've never been worried about what is going to happen at the end of it.

'You see sometimes when you make loan moves permanent, they don't work out. Then sometimes it is the opposite, you sign a loan player and he becomes the best player you could ever sign because you know him and they know the way the team works.'

Everton's young England player Ross Barkley suffered the indignity of missing an early penalty when he stepped up instead of Leighton Baines, whose conversion rate in the Premier League is 15 from 16.

Even so, Martinez insists he will continue to leave it to the players to decide who takes penalties if the regular taker Romelu Lukaku isn't on the pitch.
