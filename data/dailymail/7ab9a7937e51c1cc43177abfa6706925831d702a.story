A domestic abuser who beat his girlfriend so badly she needed reconstructive surgery on her nose has been jailed after telling her: 'You must really like being hit'.

Scott Stewart and Danielle Riseley dated on and off for eight years after they met aged 15 in Barrow, Cumbria - but Stewart turned violent just six months into the relationship.

Now 23, Danielle summoned the courage to have him prosecuted after an assault in the home they shared in February which left her with a broken nose.

Brave: Ms Riseley said she had decided to speak out to tell other domestic abuse victims that help is out there

The brave victim spoke out to help others after Stewart was jailed for seven months at Preston Crown Court.

He pleaded guilty  to assault occasioning actual bodily harm, common assault and criminal damage - but she said the sentence did not feel like a victory. 

'I am still left having panic attacks every time a door bangs or I am alone,' she said. 'I am glad that he can’t get to me any more, approach me or even come anywhere near me.

'I just hope people reading this will see this story and realise that no matter which side of the abuse you are on, there is help out there.

Violence: The ex-couple in happier times 

'Without my friends and family I wouldn’t be here today. The support I have received from them has literally saved my life.'

The court heard how on one occasion the 23-year-old pub worker told Ms Riseley: 'You must really like being hit'.

They had dated on and off but decided to give the relationship one last try last year, the court heard.

'It never even occurred to me to not get back with him,' said Ms Riseley, who now lives on the Isle of Man. 'I loved him.'

She added: 'Only his family were aware of the violence as they had to pull him off me countless times.

'They were always a great support during difficult times in our relationship. I couldn’t tell my family as I never intended for it to get as far as it did.'  

When they moved in together, she said, her ex-boyfriend's violence escalated.

'Without his parents there, he started to get angry at work and come home and scream,' she said.

'He claimed he cared for me but used to slap me and, as a result, I felt trapped.

'I didn’t think the police would help as I had no evidence. It was just my word against his, so even when he held my head under water and broke my nose, I couldn’t leave.

'We loved each other, we had our great days where we’d be the only two people on earth and I was certain we’d get past it and get better. But we didn’t.'

It comes after prosecutors last month announced their highest ever conviction rate of domestic abusers - who now make up more than a tenth of all the crimes they deal with.

Moving: Ms Riseley's plight mirrors that of more than 50,000 women across Britain in just one year

She said her ex-boyfriend's seven-month sentence did not feel like a victory, adding: 'I am still left having panic attacks every time a door bangs or I am alone. I am glad that he can’t get to me any more or approach me'

Some 58,276 defendants were convicted in 2013-14 - three-quarters of all those brought to court, and up more than 6,500 on the previous year.

Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders claimed the rise was thanks to police working with charities and specialist case workers.

She told the annual conference for the charity Women's Aid: 'Nine in ten of the domestic violence convictions arise from guilty pleas, meaning that the vast majority of victims are spared having to give evidence in court.

'I hope victims of these terrible offences will take some confidence from this, and that perpetrators will take note.'
