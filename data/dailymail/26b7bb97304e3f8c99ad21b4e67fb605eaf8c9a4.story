Forget the plain old Easter egg — this season’s chocolate treats are more likely to be flat, soft-centred or pepper-flavoured.

Mum-of-three Amanda Cable and her chocolate-loving son Charlie, 12, give their verdicts on some egg-straordinary Easter offerings.

WHAT YOU GET: An Easter egg that looks like a fried egg, with a yellow yolk and ‘fried’ white, in a box with small milk chocolate, caramel-filled ‘chips’.

AMANDA’S VERDICT: Bite into the white of your ‘fried’ egg and there’s delicious vanilla-flavoured white chocolate. Reach the yolk and the caramel truffle melts. The chips are filled with caramel. A treat that kept us all laughing.

CHARLIE’S VERDICT: Funny and tasty and my favourite egg of them all! Normally I don’t eat egg yolk, but I ate this one.

WHAT
 YOU GET: There’s a real sense of drama as you lift the lid of this 
elegant black box and the four cardboard walls open out to reveal a 
beautiful dark chocolate velvet-effect egg on a stand. The
 egg has been hand-sprayed with matte chocolate. Inside lie six 
chocolate ganache-filled speckled eggs on a nest of vanilla-flavoured 
edible shredded paper.

AMANDA’S
 VERDICT: When you crack open the egg (it’s very thick), the incredibly 
life-like mini speckled eggs have the softest, most delicious filling 
I’ve ever tried.

CHARLIE’S VERDICT: This is a clever egg. The taste is more for grown-ups, but eating the straw was awesome!

WHAT
 YOU GET: A vintage-style box containing a medium milk chocolate egg 
with sea salt, and a medium dark chocolate egg with chilli and black 
pepper.

AMANDA’S 
VERDICT: I don’t like dark chocolate, but this egg is a delicious mix of
 pepper and cocoa. The crunch of salty milk chocolate in the other egg 
was even better.

CHARLIE’S
 VERDICT: The dark egg tasted too bitter and the pepper made me cough, 
though my Dad loved it. The salty egg sounded like a bad idea but they 
actually tasted really good together — like having salt on chips.

WHAT YOU GET: A flat slab of chocolate in Cinnamon & Waffle or Cookies & Cream flavour.

AMANDA’S
 VERDICT: I found the flavour too sweet, but the children were quick to 
devour theirs, and pointed out that sickly sweet tastes are what Easter 
is all about. I think they missed the bit about Jesus.

CHARLIE’S VERDICT: Because it was flat, it was easier to stuff loads of chocolate in your mouth at once.

WHAT
 YOU GET: A beautiful hen coop with pretty chicken wire and doors that 
open to reveal milk and dark chocolate speckled eggs inside. So 
beautiful you’ll never want to throw it away.

AMANDA’S VERDICT: The chocolate melts in your mouth and even the edible ‘straw’ is delicious. A perfect gift for any age.

CHARLIE’S
 VERDICT: The little eggs are so rich I can tell they are really 
expensive and I don’t think these are for kids. At least we had the hen 
house to play with.

WHAT
 YOU GET: A pineapple so realistic that I dare anyone not to do a 
double-take. There’s a subtle spray finish in gold and green, hand-made 
score marks and a lush green crown made of solid (gorgeous) chocolate.

AMANDA’S
 VERDICT: When I attempted to break into this, it broke into about 20 
pieces — making me want to cry. This is more like a work of art than an 
egg. Rich, tasty chocolate that melts in your mouth, and it comes with a
 bag of mini eggs with exotic flavours such as Jamaican pepper and lime 
coulis.

CHARLIE’S VERDICT: I preferred this to normal pineapples.

WHAT
 YOU GET: A vintage box wrapped with ribbon, which opens to reveal an 
egg wrapped in bright blue foil. Inside the milk chocolate shell 
contains four praline quail eggs and four salted caramel seagull eggs — 
for whatever mood your teenager wakes up in.

AMANDA’S
 VERDICT: I tested this on my grumpy 15-year-old daughter and she loved 
the box. Inside, the sweet little eggs almost raised a teenage smile.

RUBY’S
 VERDICT: I think my Mum reckons she’s really funny giving me these 
eggs. As if they are just for teenagers! I slammed my door I was so 
cross, but actually the eggs are really tasty and the salty ones are 
gorgeous.

WHAT YOU GET: A stunning red presentation box tied with white and gold ribbon. Inside is a chocolate fish with pink and green decorated scales.

AMANDA’S VERDICT: This was really delicious and I appreciated each smooth, rich mouthful — unlike the children.

CHARLIE’S VERDICT: My brother and I rowed over who was going to eat which bit. In the end I had the tail, he had the eye and they both tasted really nice. Much nicer than real fish.
