Victim: Police say the body was that of Jamie Dack, aged 22

A murdered man who may have been moved through a city centre in a wheelie bin before being set alight has been named by police as officers continue to question four people.

Jamie Dack, 22, was found by firefighters in the early hours of Sunday in an industrial bin in Empress Road industrial estate in Southampton as they tackled the blaze.

Officers are now working on the theory that Mr Dack was killed at a house in Southampton and then wheeled along roads in the wheelie bin before being dumped in the industrial bin.

Those arrested, three men aged 31, 28 and 25 and a 20-year-old woman, are continuing to be quizzed after their time in custody was extended until midnight tonight.

Superintendent Julian Snowball, from 
Greater Manchester Police, said the area was slightly off the beaten 
track but near a public footpath in an area of wasteland where old fires
had been lit.

He said it was a place where people would sometimes go to drink 
or sleep rough.

The officer said a post mortem would be held to establish the cause of death.

The industrial bins have since been removed from the estate as police continue the hunt for evidence.

Detective Inspector Simon Baker of the Hampshire Major Investigation 
team said: 'We are now working on a theory that the victim was murdered 
sometime earlier at an address in the Bevois Mews and Earls Road area of
Southampton, and moved to the industrial estate, possibly in a wheelie 
bin.

'The exact route is not known at this stage so our latest appeal is 
focused on encouraging witnesses to come forward if they noticed any 
people pushing a wheelie bin in the area.

Grisly: A lorry carries the bins away as officers continue investigations and strive to identify the body. Three men aged 31, 28, and 25 and a woman aged 20 have been arrested on suspicion of murder

'The exact route is not known at this stage so our latest appeal is 
focused on encouraging witnesses to come forward if they noticed any 
people pushing a wheelie bin in the area.

'We also want to hear from members of the public who may have seen 
wheelie bins being loaded into a vehicle late on Saturday or early on 
Sunday morning.'

Police want to hear from anyone who witnessed people behaving 
suspiciously in Earls Road, Cedar Road, Clausentum Road, Forster Road, 
Spear Road, Bevois Valley Road, Verulam Road, Thomas Lewis Way, Empress 
Road and Empress Road Industrial Estate.

A complex post-mortem examination was continuing to establish the gender
and identity of the body and to discover the actual cause of death.

A team of officers are conducting further searches and a forensic 
examination of the house where the murder is thought to have taken place
and at the scene where the body was found.

Routine house-to-house and CCTV inquiries were also underway in the local community.

A doctor formally certified the victim dead at the scene and forensic officers cordoned off the 
scene close to the waterfront Sunday afternoon as they launched an 
investigation.

A spokesman for the fire service said that only one vehicle was sent to the scene to put out the blazing bin.

Police have appealed to sex workers who use the area as well as the public for help in solving the murder.
