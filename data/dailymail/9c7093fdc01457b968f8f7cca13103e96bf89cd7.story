A legally blind university student who was sprayed in the face with pepper spray has said that the experience was more terrifying than being in an earthquake.

Police used pepper spray on Anna Amelia, 23, and other students when they gained access inside the Sydney Masonic Centre on Friday morning where they began protesting against Education Minister Christopher Pyne.

Ms Amelia, who uses a walking stick, said that she remembered 'a bit of push and shove and the next minute it felt like the entire world was on fire, felt like somebody had set fire to my lungs, my eyes were burning'.

'I didn't know what was happening, I didn't know which way was up, down, left or right. It was just pain,' she told The Sydney Morning Herald.

The 23-year-old said that the incident was more terrifying than her experience during the 2010 Christchurch earthquake, and that the pepper spray had completely obscured her vision.

'I was really scared and disoriented, and almost panicked. I've been through earthquakes and this was far worse than a 7.5 earthquake,' Ms Amelia said.

The international relations and development studies student told ambulance officers who attended the scene that she just wanted to leave and get home.  

Footage of the incident shows students sprawled across the floor as friends comfort them and pour milk into their watering eyes. 

The student were protesting against university deregulation, one of Pyne's higher education reforms.

Mr Pyne was delivering a speech to several education groups inside the building. 

Students held up signs saying 'You're sPyneless' and 'Education shouldn't be a death sentence,' reports Nine News. 

Ms Amelia, who is legally blind, said the pepper spray left her completely disoriented

While the protest was initially peaceful, things grew heated when students rushed the main entrance where police used the spray.

NSW Ambulances treated at least five people at the scene.

NSW police would not confirm if pepper spray had been used, and were preparing a statement on the incident.

Ridah Hassan, a spokesperson from the National Union of Students, told Daily Mail Australia the students were undeterred by the incident.  

'We will be out in full force on March 25 to protest and make sure our voice is heard,' she said.

Hassan said police sprayed about a dozen students, including herself, when they entered the building.

'My face is on fire. It's pretty outrageous the lengths the government will go to marginalise the people,' she said.
