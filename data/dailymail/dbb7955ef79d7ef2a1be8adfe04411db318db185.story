An illegal immigrant married by the now Archbishop of York claimed £138,000 worth of benefits and made a hefty profit selling her council house back to a cash-strapped local authority.

Bigamist Rebecca Muwonge, 47, entered the country from Uganda in 1996 using the name of her 18-year-old niece Proscovia Kasozi, and immediately claimed for short-term housing benefit.

The London Borough of Newham granted her short-term accommodation twice under that name while she used her real identity to pocket benefits from the London Borough of Enfield.

Mother-of-five Muwonge was married to Samuel Bisaso, 47, at the Holy Trinity Church in Tulse Hill, south London by John Sentamu in 1996.

Dr Sentamu, who was appointed Archbishop of York in 2005, later ordained Mr Bisaso as a clergyman in the Church of Uganda, and he went on to be a Church of England chaplain for the Mission to Seafarers church charity in Immingham, near Grimsby.

The couple had a troubled marriage and although they never divorced, Muwonge married another man while the pair were separated.

Muwonge, now of Victoria Road, Keelby, Grimsby, admitted two charges of false accounting, failing to notify a change in circumstances to obtain benefit, and obtaining property by deception at Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) today

Bisaso and Muwonge were both convicted of immigration offences and jailed for 18 months after a trial in 2011.

She gave birth to one of her children in prison while serving the term.

Muwonge, now of Victoria Road, Keelby, Grimsby, admitted two charges of false accounting, failing to notify a change in circumstances to obtain benefit, and obtaining property by deception at Snaresbrook Crown Court today.

Bisaso denied three charges of conspiracy to commit fraud at the latest hearing.

The prosecution accepted that the only evidence they had against him was that he was married to Muwonge and that he lived with her.

Muwonge, who is still applying for British citizenship, had sent a letter to Newham Council purporting to be from her brother-in-law saying she had been made homeless.

After she was rehoused by the authority she made an application for a second council property in Enfield.

She bought her property in Newham at an enormous discount after exercising her ‘right-to-buy’, the court heard.

The council later bought the property back from her, and Muwonge made a profit of just over £60,000.

She was finally arrested after a joint investigation involving the two boroughs. Muwonge will be sentenced on September 27.
