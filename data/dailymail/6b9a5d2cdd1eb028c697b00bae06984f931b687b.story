How it works: The new procedure could save lives

A machine that hoovers away blood clots in the brain could save thousands of stroke patients from death or serious disability.

Clots are a leading cause of stroke – when the blood supply  is cut off to part of the brain – and need to be removed as soon as possible to restore oxygen supply to cells and prevent further damage.

Usually intravenous drugs are used to break up the blockage.

Now 20 UK hospitals are trialling the new procedure, known  as intra-arterial thrombectomy, which takes just 12 minutes.

A tube is inserted into an artery via the groin, then travels to the brain to suck up the clot.

It has already saved patients such as 60-year-old Stephen Williamson, who suffered a massive stroke on the golf course two months ago. He was found to have a 2in blood clot starving his brain of oxygen.

‘His was a very dramatic recovery,’ recalls Dr Norman McConachie,  a neuro-interventional radiologist at Queen’s Medical Centre, Nottingham, who says he has never before seen such a remarkable recovery from a stroke.

‘When he got him on to the operating table he was weak and couldn’t move the left-hand side of his body.

But we pulled the clot out and almost instantly he gave us the thumbs-up with his previously paralysed hand.’

The recovery was particularly striking as the standard clot-busting drug treatment had failed to help Stephen.

About 152,000 Britons suffer a stroke each year and there are two main types – those caused by clots and those due to burst blood vessels.

For nearly two decades, doctors have been able to reach up into the brain through the groin and stop bleeding caused by burst blood vessels.

But the use of such technology  to deal with a clot is more recent, and patients with clots in large blood vessels and arteries do less well than those with smaller clots.

Now medics want to show the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) that the ‘hoover’  is worth introducing on the NHS.

Speed is crucial as there is an urgency to removing a clot, says Dr McConachie.

‘Millions of neurons a minute are being lost while the clot  is blocking the flow of blood to the brain.

'So every minute counts. We aim to treat patients within six hours of a stroke, but the target is three hours or even less – two if possible.’

A stroke team decides which patients qualify to have their brains ‘hoovered’ by performing a brain CT angiogram scan. The procedure works by inserting a catheter (a thin tube) up to the brain through the arterial system.

A smaller catheter is fed through it, with a probe on the end that breaks up the clot into small pieces which are then hoovered down the larger tube.

Dr McConachie says it is aimed  at removing clots from the top of the carotid artery running up from the neck, the middle cerebral artery feeding the top of the brain and the basilar artery at the back of the skull.

Need for speed: When removing a blood clot, speed is crucial in order to avoid a stroke, and the intra-arterial thrombectomy takes just 12 minutes

‘These are the ones with the largest clots that don’t respond at all well to intravenous drugs. They are often several inches thick and the drugs either don’t work or take too long to break up the clot.’ NICE accepts the technology works but claims it still doesn’t know enough about how patients fare.

‘This technology is well established in other European countries, but the UK has lagged behind and we are catching up,’ says Dr McConachie.

Hundreds of patients are now being offered the hoover, either as part of the trial or separately like Stephen. He arrived at Nottingham’s City Hospital paralysed down one side but within  48 hours found the weakness and paralysis had almost completely gone.

Dr McConachie is convinced that without the treatment, Stephen would have been left wheelchair-bound and severely disabled for the rest of his life. Instead, he was back on the golf course just weeks later.

Stephen, a father of four from Chesterfield, has suffered no long-term effects. He says: ‘I have a friend who had a stroke seven years ago and she has not got her speech back and can’t move her arms and legs.

‘Yet for all intents and purposes I am the same as I was before, and I play golf to virtually the same standard. If I hadn’t had the procedure I would have been in hospital for six months trying to get my functions back and I would have had to have carers and be in a wheelchair. It’s a miracle, really.’
