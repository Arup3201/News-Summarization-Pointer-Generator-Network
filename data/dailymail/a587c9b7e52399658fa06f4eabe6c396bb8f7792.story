Militant union firebrand Len McCluskey has handed Labour its biggest donation since Ed Miliband came to power, it was revealed last night.

Tories said the £1.8million from Unite, the union he leads, makes a mockery of the Labour leader’s claims to be reducing his party’s financial reliance on unions.

News of the donation comes just days after Labour unveiled plans to cap private rents – a policy long demanded by Unite.

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said the huge gift was proof that, whatever Mr Miliband claims, his party is still in hock to the unions.

The figures, from the Electoral Commission, show that 75 per cent of the donations in the first quarter of this year came from unions.

‘Ed Miliband said he’d stand up to his union paymasters like Len McCluskey – but he’s failed and broken his promise,’ said Mr Shapps. ‘Ed Miliband is too weak to stand up to his union bosses and that means he’s too weak to stand up for Britain.

‘Union bosses are still in the driving seat at Labour HQ. They are holding the purse strings, selecting the candidates and picking the policies.

'We all know what this means - more borrowing, more spending and more taxes hitting families across the country.’

The commission figures show Labour lagging well behind the Tories in raising money,  with less than a year to go until  the general election.

It received £4.4million in significant donations in the first quarter of the year – three-quarters of them from unions, including £2.5million from Unite and Usdaw.

However, the Conservatives raked in £6.6million during the same period.

Labour said the figures include only donations of £7,500 or more. A spokesman said that once small donations and party membership fees are included, union gifts make up only 32 per cent of the total.

Party fees account for 35 per cent.

‘We welcome the unions’ support but it would be wrong to suggest that in any way it gains them undue influence over policy or that they are the sole source of the party’s funding,’ said the spokesman.

The figures were released as Tom Watson, Labour’s former election coordinator, admitted that the party is having a ‘judder’ amid dismal poll ratings, and that some in the party ‘predict disaster’ for Mr Miliband.

The former minister pulled no punches about the mood of some in the party but, writing on a Labour website, he urged activists to be ‘cheerful’ ahead of local and European elections next week.

He said Ukip supporters were usually won over when they found out about the party’s policies, including a flat rate of tax for everyone from bankers to cleaners, and proposals to break up the NHS.

Labour can also bank on a collapse in the Lib Dem vote and having more activists than the Conservatives, he said.

US strategist David Axelrod, who propelled Barack Obama to the White House, addressed the shadow cabinet yesterday about how to sharpen up their campaign.

After a disastrous week in which the Tories gained a poll lead for the first time in two years, Mr Axelrod said the cost-of-living message could win over middle-class voters.

A controversial Tory donor has given £1.5million to the party just months after being granted a knighthood.

The gift was accepted even though hedge fund boss Sir Michael Hintze was involved in a tax row.

Two years ago, it emerged that his company CQS paid just £77,000 in corporation tax in 2010 despite annual earnings of £125million.

Half of the Tories’ total donations in the first quarter of the year - £3.2million - came from donors who attended private dinners with David Cameron and other senior ministers. Many of them are hedge fund managers.

Labour claims that the Coalition has brought in £145million of tax cuts for hedge funds.

The Tories also received almost £90,000 from three people who received ‘priority investor’ status when the Royal Mail was sold, allowing them extra shares.
