Melbounre father-of-two, Scott Copeland, will fly to space after winning Virgin Australia's Velocity Frequent Flyer ultimate flight upgrade competition

From the age of ten, Scott Copeland has dreamt of becoming an astronaut and heading into outer space.

Now, the Melbourne father-of-two will finally have his dream come true after winning Virgin Australia's Velocity Frequent Flyer ultimate flight upgrade competition, which will see him travel outside the planet on the Virgin Galactic spaceship.

Mr Copeland even tracked down his grade five primary school teacher, who shattered his childhood dreams of becoming an astronaut by dubbing them impossible, to let her know that he had finally proved her wrong.

'I spoke to my teacher and said I wanted to be an astronaut, and she laughed and said "you'll have to get a real job",' Mr Copeland told Seven News.

'After 34 years, I sat down with her and talked about that conversation,' he said.

According to News.com.au, Mr Copeland went to great lengths to find his former teacher, eventually even contacting his local education union for her contact details.

'It was great that she actually remembered me although she couldn't specifically recall our banter about me becoming an astronaut but she did vaguely recall my fascination with space travel in general,' Mr Copeland told News.com.au.
