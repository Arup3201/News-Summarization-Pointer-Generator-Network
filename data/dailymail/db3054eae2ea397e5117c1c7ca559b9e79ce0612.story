Jamie McDonnell set himself up for a Las Vegas unification clash with Tomoki Kameda next year with a bizarre victory over Javier Chacon.

McDonnell, defending his WBA bantamweight world title for the first time, was struggling to impose himself on the fight when his opponent pulled out suddenly in the 10th round citing an injury to his right shoulder.

McDonnell will need a much-improved performance if he is to add the undefeated Kameda's WBO belt to his collection in March.

The Doncaster man won his title at Wembley in May when he stopped Tabtimdaeng Na Rachawat in impressive style.

He previously held the IBF strap but was stripped for failing to make a mandatory defence last year.

Chacon was a late replacement after McDonnell's initial opponent Walberto Ramos pulled out after failing to get a visa.

But the Argentine caused the champion plenty of problems in the opening rounds with his come-forward style.

McDonnell, the taller man by several inches, boxed on the outside but struggled to puncture Chacon's tight guard.

And at the halfway stages, his dreams of a lucrative trip to Sin City looked far from certain.

The odds-on favourite, fully aware of the consequences of defeat, fought with a greater sense of urgency in round eight.

And the Liverpool crowd looked set for a thrilling finish before Chacon retired 30 seconds into the 10th round, claiming he had dislocated his shoulder earlier in the fight.

McDonnell said: 'It was tough but I was stepping it up and putting shots together. I felt comfortable and felt I was winning the fight.

'I'm going to be on it for the unification fight and I'll bring another belt back to Britain.'
