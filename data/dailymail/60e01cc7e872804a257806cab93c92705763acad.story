Gadgets almost running out of battery can often strike fear in their owners but this man became even more panic stricken when he realised his camera drone was about to run out power over a lake.

The man was flying his drone fitted with a HD-3D camera for just the second time over the water in his back garden in British Columbia, Canada when he noticed the battery on the gadget was running dangerously low.

He then realised that he had to retrieve it quickly, and made a desperate dash, emptying his pockets and runs straight into the water fully-clothed to save his drone.

Footage taken from the man's drone shows it hovering over a lake filming what appears to be his family in their back garden 

But as the man realises the drone's battery is about to run out, he runs towards the water's edge 

After a momentary pause, he takes his phone and wallet out of his pockets, throwing them down, before jumping into the water full-clothed 

And luckily he just manages to grab it before it falls into the lake with the whole incident captured on camera.

The footage, filmed by the camera, starts showing the man, and what appears to be his family, enjoying a day by the lake in their garden with one of the children even wading in the water.

But then as the drone begins to fall, he realises that the battery is about to run out and he can be seen laying his iPad on the ground and running towards the lake.

After pausing for a second at the lake's edge, he then removes his wallet and his phone from his pockets and runs into the water, which is waist high, wearing all of his clothes. 

The water is waist-deep as the man makes a desperate dash to save his camera before it meets a watery ending

But with the camera dropping, he just manages to grab it in the nick of time 

The footage then shows how the camera is continuing to drop but the man manages to grab the expensive piece of kit before it meets a watery end.

He then appears to switch the gadget off before one of the children nearby shout to warn him that his wallet, which he took out of his wallet appears to be floating in the water.

The video was then posted to Youtube with the user explaining: 'This was my second flight with the DJI Phantom 2. I wasn't paying attention to the battery life and almost gave it a nice bath in the lake.

He then swtiches of the gadget as one of the children warns that his wallet is floating in the water 

'This was at the tail end of a 17+ minute flight and I wasn't paying attention to the status LEDs.' 

The DJI Phantom 2 is a remote controlled helicopter, that is fitted with a camera, GPS and WIFI.

It is said to be able to reach speeds of up to 35mph, reaching heights of up to 900 feet and costs around $1,300.
