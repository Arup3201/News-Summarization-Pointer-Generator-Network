Not the dad: Carnell Alexander has DNA proof he is not the father of the child born in 1987

A Detroit man has been ordered to pay $30,000 in child support despite not being the father.

Carnell Alexander has proven in a DNA test he is not the father of the child born in 1987, but the state wants him to pay anyway - and is threatening him with prison if he does not.

The situation arose when an ex-partner of Mr Alexander put him down as the father of her child in an application for financial support from the state in the late 80s,

She began receiving support, and as far as the state was concerned Mr Alexander was liable to pay it back.

A court order was issued notifying him of his obligation to pay, and a process server assigned to deliver the notice told the court he had done so but that Mr Alexander had refused to sign a receipt.

But Mr Alexander was in prison for an unrelated crime at the time the order was supposedly delivered, and he never received it.  

He had no idea about the paternity suit until he was stopped by a traffic officer in the early 1990s, who discovered Mr Alexander was the subject of an outstanding warrant for failing to pay paternity.

‘I knew I didn’t have a child, so I was kind of blown back,’ Mr Alexander told 7 Action News.

Mr Alexander has been trying to fight the paternity suit ever since.

Mr Alexander claims that before the arrest, he had never heard of the court order, let alone of the child.

The long legal process involved Mr Alexander tracking down the mother of the child and getting a DNA test that proved his innocence.

The mother told the TV channel that she had no idea the state was pursuing Mr Alexander, and that she had only put her ex-boyfriend’s name down as the father in a desperate attempt to get state assistance.

She says she did not realise the state would go after the father, in this case the falsely accused Mr Alexander, over the payments.

The mother of the child has since gone to the court to ask that the debt owed to her personally - totalling $70,000 - be forgiven.

This was granted, but a judge still demands the other half, about $30,000 which is owed to the state, is paid back.

Mr Alexander has refused and is now being threatened with jail time.

‘I feel like I’m standing in front of a brick wall with nowhere to go,’ Mr Alexander told the TV channel.
