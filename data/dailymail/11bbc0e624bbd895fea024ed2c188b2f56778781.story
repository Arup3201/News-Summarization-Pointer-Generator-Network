A horse which single-handedly brought both sides of the M62 to a standstill when it leapt into the motorway from a field has had to be put down.

Student Olivia Wynn took a picture of the galloping animal from the passenger seat of the car she was driving back from a day trip in York in with her mum, Deborah just by junction 27 near Birstall, West Yorkshire.

All lanes were affected for almost one hour when the horse hurtled through a fence near junction 28 in Tingley and attempted to travel the wrong way along the east-bound side at evening rush hour.

Then it jumped over the central reservation into the west bound lane and ran at least three miles up the motorway to Birstall.

Sadly the horse had to be put down after suffering severe damage to its leg while running free down the motorway.

Police say they have no idea where the animal came from, or who it belonged to, but that it had badly injured itself whilst running free on the motorway and had to be put down.

Inspector David Peach, of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'We tried to corral the horse to safety but whilst it had been running free, it had caused severe damage to its leg and when it was finally rescued, it was in considerable distress.

'The only humane option was to put it down. The only right thing to do was to put it out of its misery.'

Olivia, 20, who is studying American studies at Sussex University, was on her iPhone looking at social media websites when she looked up and saw the horse galloping down the road.

She said: 'We were just sat crawling along the road. It was a slow journey.

'Then we looked up and saw one of those animal warning signs on the motorway - beware animals on the road.

All lanes were affected for almost one hour when the dare devil animal hurtled through a fence near junction 28 in Tingley and attempted to travel the wrong way along the east-bound side at 5.05pm

'I said to my mum "I have never seen an animal on the motorway" and seconds later my mum lets out a yelp. I thought there had been a car crash. I looked up and I saw this horse. It was coming full force at us. Then I just snapped and got the picture.

'We were in the outside lane. I was just praying it didn't hit the car and injure itself.

'It missed us by a few feet.

'Afterwards I couldn't believe how clear the picture was. It was certainly a fast horse. If it wasn't on a motorway it might have got done for speeding.'

Deborah, who lives in Rochdale, said: 'Not what you expect to see on the M62. It was a bit scary to say the least.'

Her father, Mark Wynn, is chairman of professional rugby league club, Rochdale Hornets.

Mr Wynn said: 'I think they were just very shocked to see a horse in full flight. It was a wild animal animal on an ultra modern road. It made for a surprising contrast.

'The last thing you expect is a horse coming towards you at full speed.'

In a Twitter alert, West Yorkshire Police RPU, who were called to the scene following calls from several bewildered motorists, said that it was 'running all over the place' and warned drivers to be careful.

Police officers stopped lanes and slowed traffic until they were able to approach the horse.

They are now trying to arrange for repairs to be made to the fence to prevent it from escaping again.

No passengers or vehicles were hurt in the bizarre incident.
