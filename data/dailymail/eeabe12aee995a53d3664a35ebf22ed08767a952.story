Fined: Robert Thielen discovered earlier this year that his 30-year-old fiancee, who was named only as Diana, was a high-class escort

A financier has been ordered to honour a £862,000 cheque that he gave his ex-fiancee before finding out that she was an international prostitute.

Private equities boss Robert Thielen, 52, had proposed to the Russian call girl, identified only as Diana, two years ago.

A court in Monaco heard he handed her a cheque for one million euros – the equivalent of £862,000 – as an ‘unconditional financial security’ to be cashed after they were married.

But Mr Thielen, who was born in the Netherlands, discovered earlier this year that his 30-year-old fiancee was a high-class escort.

The court heard that she was selling sex in London, Moscow and the French Riviera.

It was even claimed that the wealthy property tycoon had been paying for her flights as she jetted across Europe servicing her clients.

Mr Thielen swiftly called off the engagement and demanded that she return gifts and jewellery including a £60,000 diamond engagement ring.

His ex-lover refused, and when the one million euro cheque was bounced by Mr Thielen’s Monaco bank, the call girl took him to court to demand the money.

Thielen told the Monaco correctional court: ‘As soon as I found out about her job, I broke off the engagement and demanded the return of both the jewellery and the cheque.’

But the prostitute told the judge: 
‘He told me the cheque was a guarantee of security to avoid having any 
kind of marriage contract, and we agreed I would cash it after we were 
married.’

Mr Thielen, who has invested in 
multi-million-pound property in London, was told to honour the cheque 
and pay a £860 fine, but intends to appeal the ruling.

His spokesman called the case ‘a very unpleasant matter’.
