Unable to play his way into the side, overlooked for a place among Paul McGinley’s elite corps of vice-captains, Paul Lawrie will still be contributing to the Team Europe cause at Gleneagles.

For starters, he’ll be answering Ryder Cup rookie Stephen Gallacher’s invitation for a chat, the veteran of the Miracle at Medinah – and the Beastliness at Brookline before that – glad to pass on the benefits of his own experience.

When the big transatlantic bash tees off, meanwhile, Lawrie will be right there in the throng – shouting himself hoarse in support of Stevie G and the boys.

The former Open champion, a huge Aberdeen fan who aims to bring some of his Pittodrie verbals to Perthshire, didn’t hold back in expressing his disappointment when McGinley left him out of his backroom staff. Ask him now how he feels about being on the outside of the ropes and, candidly, he replies: ‘Nae great.’

The lure of a Ryder Cup on home soil is too strong to resist, though. So he’ll watch the opening day’s action on TV, before throwing himself into the role of supportive on-site spectator.

‘I’m heading down Friday night,’ he revealed. ‘The guy that we’ve got our car deal with, Morrison Motors, has a big house, so me and my wife are going down to spend the weekend with him.

‘So we’re going to be there – I’ll be walking around with Stevie, hopefully on the Saturday if he’s playing, then definitely on the Sunday.

‘It will feel a bit weird. Obviously I wanted to play but I can’t, so I just have to look forward to watching. I’m still looking forward to going and enjoying a great event.

‘It’ll be a fantastic atmosphere and there are about 10 of us staying in this house – all good pals – so it should be great fun.

‘I’ve never been to support at a Ryder Cup. It’s going to be a different experience when I get there – but I’ll enjoy it, get into it, be pulling for all the boys to play well.

‘I’m a pretty big shouter at Pittodrie, I get right into it. And I’ll absolutely be giving it all of that at Gleneagles! But people won’t recognise me. I won’t have the usual gear on with all the sponsors’ badges covering me.’

This week, Lawrie is back at Celtic Manor, where he briefly – but not enjoyably, he says now – served as an on-course commentator for the 2010 Ryder Cup. Before now and his opening tee time in the ISPS Handa Wales Open on Thursday, he’ll keep that promise to sit down with Gallacher.

Asked to provide a sneak preview of the best advice he might hand down to his fellow Scot, Lawrie said: ‘I remember when I played practice rounds with Monty, he said that it all happens pretty quickly.

‘You have to, not slow down exactly, but just take your time. Make your decisions deliberately.

‘Because everything goes by just so quick in that event. Everything is speeded up.

‘Walk at normal pace, that’s important. You can find yourself rushing off when you’re under pressure. But Stevie will know all that. He doesn’t need me to tell him.

‘He’ll love it. Absolutely love it. There are very few moments when you think: “Oh, I’m not so sure about this”.

‘There are a couple of moments when you’ll get that. But it goes pretty quickly.

‘No, he’ll just have a ball of a time. Especially with the crowd. I’m gutted I’ m not there – but delighted for him, obviously.

‘I’m sure we’re going to see each other this week for a bite to eat. He doesn’t need me to tell him what’s what – but anything he wants to run past me is fine, obviously.

‘It’s just whatever he wants to ask. He asked if it was all right to have a sit-down and pick my brains. It’s not an issue.

‘You’ve got to experience the nerves of a Ryder Cup to know what it’s like. But he’ll deal with it.

‘He’s been in pressure situations before, he’s won tournaments. When he was defending in Dubai, he played with Tiger and Rory. He knows what it’s all about.

‘Having said that, he has to magnify those experiences by 10, just to get an idea of the feelings he’ll experience.

‘But the crowd will help. He’ll know that most of them are there to watch him. And the first time he plays will be amazing. The place will be bouncing.’
