A panda who has grown depressed with boredom and loneliness has been given a plasma TV in order to cheer her up.

Sijia is one of three giant pandas which had to be rescued from the Wolong National Natural Reserve when they were left orphaned and abandoned in the devastating 2008 earthquake in Wenchuan, Sichuan province.

Silja and her fellow panda survivors were then sent to the Yunnan Wild Animal Park, and this year the others were returned successfully to the wild.

However, with zoo keepers saying that Sijia is not ready to be released just yet, she is living alone in her cage with limited stimulation.

A short while after the other two were removed, keepers noticed that Sija had become uninterested in her food and showed signs of depression.

Animal psychology experts concluded that her cage was not interesting enough and ordered new toys for Sija, including the plasma TV to be installed to help pass the time.

Happy bear: Animal psychology experts also ordered that Sija be given a swing to play on in her enclosure at the Yunnan Wild Animal Park in Sichuan province,

Distractions: The big panda has also been given a 'fake friend' in the shape of a giant cuddly toy panda to make her feel less lonely

She was also given a giant sized cuddly panda to help remove the feelings of loneliness, as well as a swing just the right size for a panda looking to have fun.

So far, Yunnan Wild Animal Park say that the distractions seem to be working, and in particular the TV images of wild pandas going about their lives have proven particularly successful in distracting Sijia from her loneliness.

Zu spokesman De Liu said: ‘It is still early days yet, but we are cautiously optimistic that we may have given her enough to do to stop her getting more depressed.’
