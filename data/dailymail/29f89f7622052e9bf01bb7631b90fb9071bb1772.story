Edward Snowden has finally been allowed to leave the airport in Moscow where he has been living for over a month after he received a document granting him asylum in Russia for one year.

The American fugitive wanted for leaking classified intelligence documents stepped out of Sheremetyevo airport this afternoon after weeks spent in legal limbo.

His Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said: 'I have just handed him the documents from the Russian Federal Migration Service. They allow him to leave the airport.'

He added: 'I have just seen him off. He has left for a secure location. Security is a very serious matter for him.'

Out: Edward Snowden has left the Moscow airport where he had been living for the past month

Snowden
 slipped out of the airport in a taxi without being spotted by the 
dozens of reporters and photographers who have camped out in the airport
 for weeks.

'He is the 
most wanted man on planet Earth,' his lawyer said. 'What do you think he
 is going to do? He has to think about his personal security. I cannot 
tell you where he is going.

'I
 put him in a taxi 15 to 20 minutes ago and gave him his certificate on 
getting refugee status in the Russian Federation. He can live wherever 
he wants in Russia. It's his personal choice.'

The
 refugee was accompanied by Sarah Harrison, a British representative of 
WikiLeaks who has been staying with Snowden in the airport.

The group tweeted: 'Edward Snowden has successfully acquired refugee status in Russia and will shortly leave the airport.'

It added: 'We would like to thank the Russian people and all those others who have helped to protect Mr Snowden. We have won the battle - now the war.'

The 30-year-old has apparently agreed not to disclose any more classified information as a condition of his remaining in Russia.

Snowden faces living under strict 
curbs imposed by the Russian security agencies even though he has been 
allowed to move from his hideaway in an airport transit zone.

Gone: Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena announced that his client had been granted asylum

Long stay: Snowden has been in legal limbo in the airport for more than a month since arriving in Hong Kong

He arrived at Sheremetyevo from Hong Kong on June 23 but was unable to leave because the U.S. had revoked his passport.

The
 runaway's movements will initially be strictly curtailed, but President
 Vladimir Putin has denied his intelligence services are seeking secrets
 known to the former contractor for the National Security Agency.

The revelation will fuel U.S. concerns
 that further sensitive data is in jeopardy and could fall into the hands of the Russian government. The White House has been ‘seeking clarity’ about Snowden's status.

In the US, Sen. Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, has said Snowden is a 'fugitive who belongs in a United States courtroom' and said the episode damaged U.S.-Russian relations.

'Edward Snowden is a fugitive who belongs in a United States courtroom, not a free man deserving of asylum in Russia,' he said, according to the Guardian. 'Regardless of the fact that Russia is granting asylum for one year, this action is a setback to US-Russia relations.

'Edward Snowden will potentially do great damage to US national security interests and the information he is leaking could aid terrorists and others around the world who want to do real harm to our country.

'Russia must return Snowden to face trial at home.'

Vladimir
 Volokh, the head of the public council of the Russian Federal Migration
 Service, insisted: ‘He will only be allowed to stay in places 
designated by Russian law enforcement agencies.’

Kremlin
 official Yuri Ushakov insisted today that the long-running saga would 
not affect ties between the U.S. and Russia, saying Snowden's case was 
'relatively insignificant'.

He added: 'Our president has expressed hope many times that this will not affect the character of our relations.'

Snowden has indicated he later hopes 
to secure exile in South America with offers from Venezuela, Bolivia and
 Nicaragua, but this week his lawyer said he might apply for Russian 
citizenship.

‘Edward 
also asked me to thank all the women in Russia for offering him to marry
 them,’ added the lawyer. ‘He was in stitches of laughter when he heard 
that there were a lot of such proposals.

‘I passed him some clothes. I noticed that each time we meet he wears one and the same shirt.

‘So
 I went out and bought him some shirts and trousers so that he at least 
could have a chance to change. There is no laundry or ironing service in
 the conditions where he lives right now.’

He brought the fugitive classic Russian books by Anton Chekhov, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel Crime and Punishment.

The novel is about the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of a poor ex-student who kills a pawnbroker for her cash, but Kucherena said: ‘I'm not implying he's going through a similar mental anguish.’

Russia has rejected White House calls for Snowden to be deported to the US to face espionage charges for leaking details of the NSA's wide-ranging spying activities targeting data and phone communication.

Volokh confirmed Snowden would ‘not be extradited to any country where his life might be in danger, because he has applied for asylum here.’  Putin demanded that Snowden stops leaking secrets damaging to the U.S. while he is in Russia.

Security experts say the records of other phone companies are also involved. Subsequent stories by the Guardian and The Washington post contain further surveillance revelations.

June 9: Snowden, who claims to have worked at the National Security Agency and the CIA, allows himself to be identified as the source of disclosures about the secret U.S. surveillance programs. Snowden tells the Guardian his 'sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.'

June 25: Russian President Vladimir Putin says Snowden is in the transit zone of a Moscow airport and will not be extradited to the United States, adding that he is free to go anywhere. Without a U.S. passport, Snowden is effectively stranded. The White House says Russia has a 'clear legal basis' to expel the leaker.

June 27: President Barack Obama says he won't engage in 'wheeling, dealing and trading' to get Snowden extradited to the U.S.
