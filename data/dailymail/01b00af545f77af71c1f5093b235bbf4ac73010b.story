Sen. John Hoeven says Venezuela has released four missionaries from North Dakota who were detained several days ago.

Hoeven says in a statement his office learned from pastor Bruce Dick of the Bethel Evangelical Free Church in Devils Lake that Venezuelan authorities released the missionaries Saturday.

U.S. Embassy Press Director Glenn Guimond said the missionaries boarded a plane out of the country Saturday morning and would not be allowed back for two years.

The missionaries were apparently detained Wednesday while working in conjunction with a church west of Caracas.

They had been in the country for several days providing medical assistance. They've been making trips for several years.

Hoeven's spokesman, Don Canton, says Dick confirmed the group was headed to nearby Aruba on Saturday.

Dick didn't travel with the group.

The New York Times reports that Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro had spoken out against what he believes were capitalist aggressors and especially the U.S. for the country's economic woes only hours after the missionaries were detained. 

Venezuela is going through recession, inflation, and a shortage of medicines and goods.
