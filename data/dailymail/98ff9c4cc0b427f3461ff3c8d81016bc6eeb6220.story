A former jihadi who fought for ISIS in Syria and Iraq has revealed that he left the depraved terror group after being ordered to execute his friends and take part in the rape of Yazidi sex slaves.

The 33-year-old ex-militant, who comes from the ISIS-held city of Fallujah, spoke of becoming disillusioned with jihad after seeing his commanders turn into bloodthirsty, sex-mad savages.

Senior militants are said to take advantage of thousands of young foreign schoolgirls travelling to join the terror group by exploiting a legal loophole allowing them to sign a one-week marriage contract before  divorcing them and passing them on another fighter.

But for Hamza, who recently managed to escape his ISIS commanders in Iraq, the final straw was his shock at the terror group's unquenchable thirst for brutal executions and his disgust at the militants' treatment of young Yazidi women who are bought, sold and  viciously raped as sex slaves.

Speaking of his time with the terror group, Hamza told The Independent's Patrick Cockburn that he was paid 400,000 Iraqi dinars a month (equivalent to £231) - but was also rewarded with free food, fuel and access to the internet.

Fighters are  brainwashed into spending all their spare time attending religious lectures and reading the Koran and ISIS ' jihadi propaganda by offering cash prizes to those with the greatest knowledge at regular competitions.

He claimed that after his home city was overrun by militants, he had little choice but to join ISIS, who quickly sent him to a training camp in their de facto Syrian capital Raqqa before forcing him to take a crash course in becoming an ISIS executioner.

After being forced to watch countless videos of brutal beheadings, the former militant was ordered to carry out the execution of a number of local Sunni men accused of working with the government. 

Recognising a number of the men as his former friends, Hamza refused to carry out the atrocity. His superiors surprisingly granted him permission to avoid the beheadings but he was warned he wouldn't be excused from similar work in the future.

Brutal: Ex-militant Hamza said he was shocked at the terror group's unquenchable thirst for  executions

An eight strong volunteer unit of former British servicemen are preparing to travel to Syria to fight against militants from the Islamic State terrorist organisation, it has been claimed.

The ex-soldiers - some of whom have Special Forces training - call themselves the International Volunteer Force and will fight alongside the Kurdish resistance  in the north of the country.

 

Images posted on social media purportedly show the men taking part in special training exercises in Europe.

They were taken ahead of their journey to Syria, where they join an estimated 100 other Western volunteers to have joined the Kurdish peshmerga and YPG armies in the fight against ISIS terrorists.

Shortly after avoiding beheading his former friends, Hamza realised his future life as an ISIS executioner was not something he wanted.

Those feelings were compounded when last December 13 kidnapped Yazidi girls were brought to the property where he was staying and he was invited to rape them.

'The commander tried to tempt us by saying that this is Halal [lawful] for you, a gift from Allah that we are allowed to satisfy ourselves without even marrying them because they are pagans,' he said.

'These scenes terrified me. I imagined myself being caught up in these shootings, executions, beheadings and raping, if I stayed where I was,' he added. 

Shortly afterwards Hamza plotted his escape from ISIS, despite a friend having been caught and brutally executed for doing the same thing.

Using the instant messaging service Viber, Hamza contacted friends outside ISIS' self-declared caliphate before being granted permission to call his family on a mobile as a reward for his perceived 'loyalty and courage'.  He then used the phone to arrange his escape, 

Hamza claims he is now entirely disillusioned with Isis, saying: 'At the beginning I thought they were fighting for Allah, but later I discovered they are far from the principles of Islam.'

'I know that some fighters were taking hallucinatory drugs; others were obsessed with sex. As for the raping, and the way different men marry by turn the same woman over a period of time, this is not humane,' he added.
