Changzi Deng was charged with aggravated assault after the incident in Austin, Texas

A man obsessed with his ex-girlfriend flew more than 7,000 miles from China to Texas to plead for a second chance, but stabbed her in the face with a fork when she rejected him.

Changxi Deng was arrested last Wednesday on the University of Texas campus after being held by other students who witnessed the attack.

The 22 year old had traveled to the US from his home in China in the hope of persuading his former girlfriend to rekindle their relationship.

But after she rejected his advances, he allegedly pulled out a fork from his pocket and plunged it into his ex's face.

Other students heard the girl, who has not been named, screaming and rushed to help.

'I ran out and grabbed the guy's wrist and pushed him into the wall to get him off the girl and another guy ran over and separated the girl', Thometz told Kxan.com.

Deng was held at the scene in Austin, Texas, and the bloody fork recovered.

The girl suffered puncture wounds to her nose and was treated in hospital.

Deng told investigators he had been in a relationship with the woman while they were both studying at university in China.

He said his girlfriend enrolled in a Masters degree course at the University of Texas in Austin.

Deng researched the masters program for himself so he could find out what classes his ex-girlfriend would be taking.

He then traveled to the U.S. and waited outside various classrooms at the university until he finally met up with her outside the Engineering-Science building.

Investigators say the victim attempted to evade Deng and warned him that she would call police if he didn't leave her alone.

'They had studied similar classes for undergrad studies and so he had a good idea of what classes she was going to be taking,' said Sergeant Charles Bonnet.

Deng was booked into jail and charged with aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury.

His bond was set at $50,000 and he was ordered to not have any contact with the woman and stay at least 200 yards away from her.
