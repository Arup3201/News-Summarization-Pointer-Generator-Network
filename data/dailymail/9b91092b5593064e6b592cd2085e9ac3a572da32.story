David Blunkett is one of Labour’s moderates and was a key ally of Tony Blair, but ‘Red Ed’ Miliband’s party has chosen an extremist to succeed him.

In a vivid reflection of the sharp Left turn that Labour has taken under Miliband, the party has selected Harry Harpham, a former coal miner who specialises in abuse of Margaret Thatcher.

He will be Labour’s General Election candidate for Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, where Blunkett — who is stepping down after 28 years in the House of Commons — enjoys a thumping 13,632 majority.

On the day Baroness Thatcher died of a stroke at the age of 87, Harpham posted a photograph on social media of himself celebrating the death of the former Prime Minister.

The picture showed Harpham grinning as he raised a pint glass and giving a thumbs up to mark her demise with fellow Labour councillors in Sheffield.

‘Having one for Maggie with some good comrades,’ he wrote in the caption.

Harpham worked at Clipstone Colliery, near Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, at the time of the 1984-85 miners’ strike.

Blamed: Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher

His colleagues were horrified by the militant stance taken by NUM leader Arthur Scargill, who hoped to use the strike to bring down Thatcher’s government, in the same way that the trade union had helped to destroy Sir Edward Heath’s Conservative administration with its industrial action in 1974.

In protest against Scargill, Harpham’s Nottinghamshire colleagues set up a moderate, rival organisation, the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, and returned to work. However, Harpham stuck with Scargill. ‘Arthur was spot on,’ he later said. ‘I was proud to have been a very active member of the NUM during the strike.’

The councillor refuses to apologise for his tweet about Lady Thatcher’s death last year. ‘Undoubtedly, her family will feel loss, but my thoughts are towards those communities she destroyed,’ he says.

Despite Labour being in power for 13 of the 24 years since Mrs T was forced out of 10 Downing Street, Harpham continues to blame her for Britain’s difficulties. ‘Everything that is wrong with this country can be traced back to Thatcher,’ he claimed just ten days ago.

Sounds like he will be a sure-fire bet for promotion under Marxist historian’s son Miliband.
