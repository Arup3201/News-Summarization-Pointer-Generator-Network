There could be a 
glimmer of hope for the British Summer as weather forecasters predicted 
that the monsoon type weather might finally be over.

According
to the Met Office there will be occasional showers with bouts of 
sunshine over the next five days and temperatures will be more in line 
with the seasonal average.

'It's
looking like the temperature will be close to the seasonal average and 
certainly for the next five days it won't be as unsettled as it has 
been,' said Met Office spokeswoman Jenny Rourke. 'There are also no more
warnings in place and from what we can tell, it's generally looking a 
bit better.'

The weather will be unsettled with 
rain in most parts of the country on Monday with temperatures reaching 
highs of up to 19C (66F).

Tuesday
will have the best of the weather with temperatures reaching highs of 
up to 22C (72F) and minimum temperatures of 13C (55F).

It
certainly will be an improvement on the recent weather which could be 
likened to monsoon season and has seen people huddling under brollies as
towns as cities get lashed with torrential rain.

On
Friday morning storms swept across the country bringing 55mph winds and
half the month’s average rainfall. And unsurprisingly today was no 
better with most of the country experiencing bands of heavy rain and 
showers. 

There was 
the occasional risk of thunder in some places especially in northern 
England and Southern England. The South East experienced the best of the
weather.

One of the 
most bizarre meteorological phenomenons so far has been a bank of cloud 
which looked as though a tornado was forming off Bossiney Bay in 
Tintagel, Cornwall.

Despite
fears from onlookers, meteorologists said it was likely to be a rare 
funnel cloud which is caused by currents deep within shower clouds.

On
Friday two yachts ran aground off Plymouth, and three crewmen were 
airlifted to safety from two boats off the Isles of Scilly. In Bingley, 
West Yorkshire, an inch of rain fell in 15 hours, and parts of Wales 
were pelted with more than an inch.

The Environment Agency was forced to 
issue 19 flood alerts covering East Anglia, the South East, the Midlands
and parts of the North East.

The
latest storms follow dreadful weather conditions earlier this week 
which resulted in more than three inches, or 80mm, of rain falling in 
just 24 hours, leaving
homes and roads flooded.

Firefighters were on flood alert in many parts of the country with crews in the south
west - which have seen a huge surge in flooding-related 
call outs since the start of the week -  braced for more this 
weekend.

Several fire crews have had to rescue 
drivers who ignored road closures and diversion warnings and drove into 
flooded roads over the past week

There have also been a number of 
dramatic sea rescues with an air-sea rescue helicopter airlifting three 
crewmen injured on two boats in stormy weather off the Isles of Scilly 
this morning.

One man suffered a broken ankle and two others suffered a fractured arm and cuts. Ken Bazeley of Falmouth Coastguard 
said 'There are several vessels that we are monitoring all the time as 
they make their way back to Falmouth or Plymouth or the south coast of 
Cornwall that have suffered mast or steering problems.'

The Penlee lifeboat was also launched 
on Friday morning to go to a yacht which broadcast a Mayday. An RNLI 
spokesman said 'The Penlee 
all-weather lifeboat launched to assist a 38ft yacht with two people on 
board 12 miles south of Newlyn. The yacht had managed to lose a sail 
overboard that got tangled around the keel and rudder in a south east 
gale.

'The lifeboat arrived on the scene in
40 minutes and managed to secure a rope to the yacht then started the 
tow back to Newlyn. Later the Penlee Inshore Lifeboat 
launched as the vessels approached the harbour to help tow the yacht 
through the gaps in testing conditions, and the yacht was safely 
moored.'

Meanwhile there were reports that two more ran yachts had run aground in huge seas off Plymouth in Devon.

Scillonian
Ferry services between Penzance and the Isles of Scilly were also 
cancelled 
because of dangerously high seas and a number of boats were ripped from 
their moorings overnight on Thursday in Falmouth and Penryn in Cornwall.

The Environment Agency said people in Devon and Cornwall should 'remain prepared' for the possibility of flooding.

Devon County Council said its 
highways department, which was still clearing up debris from last week’s
storms, was 'geared up' to deal with any incidents.

The
storms have resulted in some huge seas of the coastline with surfers 
taking advantage of massive waves in Harlyn Bay in Cornwall and huge 
waves were also seen crashing over a lighthouse in Porthcawl, Wales.

Meanwhile,
spectators huddled underneath their umbrellas as rain stopped play 
during a quarter final singles tennis match at the Queen's Club grass 
court championships in London.

The Met Office said it was too early 
to say whether this month was on course to be the wettest June on 
record, beating the 2007 figure of 136.2mm. The average June rainfall is
72.6mm.

Despite the torrential conditions, the
Met Office said the UK was still below its average rainfall for the 
year. Between January and May, 392.5mm of rain fell across the country, 
compared with an average of 439mm.

Nevertheless, temperatures have been 
miserable for many. Forest Row, East Sussex, only reached 10.7C on 
Tuesday, almost 10C below normal for June.

Sunshine is down 60 per cent so far 
this month, with England and Wales averaging just 30 hours’ sunshine. 
June normally sees 178 hours’ sunshine.

Although there have been heavy showers
in parts of the South West, Wales and the North West, parts of the 
country which were on flood alert after days of heavy rain were given 
breathing space this week with clear skies in the South East and London.

The break in the weather came as three
of the UK’s biggest water companies announced they would lift hosepipe 
bans, imposed to deal with drought, following weeks of heavy rain.

Thames Water, Anglian Water and Southern Water were to remove the restrictions in place since early April from Thursday.

Seven water companies across southern 
and eastern England brought in hosepipe bans after two unusually dry 
winters left some groundwater supplies and rivers as low as in the 
drought year of 1976.

The Environment Agency had urged 
people in Devon, Cornwall, west Somerset, North Wales and parts of the 
Midlands to remain prepared for the possibility of floods as the Met 
Office issued a weather warning for heavy rain.
