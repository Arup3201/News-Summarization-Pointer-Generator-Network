A golf star who died when her car careened off the road and hit a tree in Alabama was on her way home from a night of drinking.

Former LPGA

 player Danielle Downey, 33, lost control of her vehicle after speeding past a motorist on Lee Road 57 in Auburn about 10pm Thursday. She plunged into a tree and was thrown from the car as it rolled several times.

Downey was rushed to East Alabama Medical Center  but died from major head injuries.

Golfing champion: Downey, a New York native, was a three-time All American

According to an Alabama Department of Public Safety crash report released last night, Downey had been drinking with friends at a restaurant before the fatal crash.

Her close mate Diana Ramage said she had tried to take Downey's car keys so she wouldn't drive home, fearing she was too intoxicated to get behind the wheel. 

News of the New York native's tragic death has shocked her friends and family, who praised Downey's generosity and selflessness.

Downey was in her second season as Auburn's director of golf operations and filled in for coach Kim Evans during the 2012-13 season after Evans was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

'I'm absolutely devastated,' Evans told Sporting News.

'Danielle meant so much to me, the girls and this program. Not only did she give much of her life to Auburn as a student-athlete and as a mentor to these young women, but she was so instrumental to this team during some tough times over the past year. Danielle was like a daughter to me.'

The Rochester native, nicknamed 'Deuce', was a three-time All-American who finished second in the 2002 NCAA tournament.

Downey had seven top-10 finishes and one tournament victory on the Futures Tour.

She finished in the money 15 times on the LPGA Tour from 2006 through 2010, including a career-best fourth at the 2008 Bell Micro LPGA Classic.

Downey returned to school and graduated in May 2013 with a degree in health promotion.

'This is a tragic and devastating loss for Danielle's family, our student-athletes and staff and the entire Auburn family,' Auburn athletic director Jay Jacobs said.

'Danielle cared deeply about people and she was loved by all who knew her. She impacted a lot of lives here as a player and a member of our staff.'

'Danielle would give you the shirt off her back,' said Auburn alumna Nicole Hage.

'And if she didnâ€™t have a shirt, sheâ€™d spend all day finding one for you.'

Downey is survived by her parents, Mike and Phyllis, and sisters Erica Setzer, Melissa Sage and Shawna Tomasso, according to Golf Week.

Family and friends said Downey lived to bring joy to the lives of her three nieces and three nephews.
