The average British worker can be tempted into a new job for less than £2,000.

The loyalty of workers here can be had for a pay rise of only 5.3 per cent, making employees here among the cheapest for companies luring away staff.

At the average UK wage of £26,500, this means British staff need be offered a pay rise of just £1,722 to swap jobs.

The average British worker will move to a new job for as little as a five per cent pay rise, a new study has shown (picture posed by models)

Their readiness to jump ship contrasts sharply with workers in fast-growing economies who require much bigger incentives to leave their current positions.

On average, employees in Indonesia would require a 20.6 per cent pay rise to change jobs, the going rate in Brazil is 20.1 per cent, 17.1 per cent in South Africa and 12 per cent in China, according to a study of 18,000 workers by global advisory firm CEB.

Closer to home the size of carrot to lure people drops, but even workers in recession-hit Spain would want 5.9 per cent and those in France say they would need an 8.6 per cent rise in pay to move.

The Scandinavian nations, which have largely avoided the effects of the global financial crisis, also require more to move than those in the UK, with an average raise of 6.7 per cent cited.

In Europe only workers in Italy at 4.5 per cent, Germany at 3.9 per cent and Belgium and the Netherlands at 2.8 per cent are more cheaply bought than a British worker.

The research shows that despite global economic recovery, pay expectations among workers have fallen on a worldwide basis.

This year the all-country average for the compensation increase to move was a modest 8.6 per cent, down from 10.3 per cent a year ago.

Despite the ending of the recession, the survey found that British workers feel the best way of securing a pay rise was to move job

Jean Martin, executive director at CEB, said: 'Britain’s great recession is over, but employees here remain surprisingly negative about their pay prospects in comparison with elsewhere.

'Perhaps Brits have absorbed the persistent message of a recessionary squeeze on budgets more than their counterparts.

'Our research in the first quarter of 2014 shows the percentage of HR executives in Europe expecting to see their budgets increase in the next 12 months has doubled compared to the same time last year.

'Economic prospects look better than they have for a long time but poor expectations on pay may mean our best talent is on the move just as we have more money to invest in them.'

CEB also looked at the strongest drivers for moving jobs, with work-life balance the biggest attraction in the UK, followed by location, stability and then respect. Compensation was rated fifth most important by British workers, compared with first by those employed in Canada, China, France, Germany and the US.

How actively people are seeking a new role was also investigated, with a reading of 39.9 in the UK for staff hunting jobs, a drop of 8.2 per cent on the previous quarter and just below the global average of 41.

The most active job seekers are to be found in India, where the reading was 55.8, then South Africa at 51.9.

The most passive nations are Japan at 30.2 and then Germany at 33.
