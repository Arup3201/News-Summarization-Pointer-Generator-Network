Three West Virginia teenagers died Saturday in a horrific head-on collision with a fire truck.

High School juniors Kristyn Butcher, Kaylin Blake Rice and John Snow, all 16-years-old, died after trying to pass a car as a fire truck raced in the opposite direction towards a blaze – the two girls died instantly, Mr Snow passed away at a local hospital.

The three firefighters aboard the New Manchester Volunteer Fire Department truck were all treated for minor injuries and have been released from a local hospital, according to WFMJ.

Hancock County Sheriff Ralph Fletcher told WTRF that witnesses reported seeing the car pull into the opposite lane to pass a car just as the fire truck came roaring towards them in the opposite direction.

‘Evidence on the roadway, in conjunction with the witness statements, indicates the passenger vehicle attempted to pull back into the southbound lane, however unsuccessfully,’ he added.

Ms Butcher, from Newell, was driving the vehicle, she was pronounced dead at the scene with Ms Rice. Mr Snow survived a trip to a local hospital before dying a short time later.

Police have not said if alcohol or drugs played a role in the crash, and MailOnline was unable to reach local authorities for further comment.

The driver’s mother is still in disbelief over her daughter’s death.

‘She smiled at everybody. She was always happy and bubbly,’ Lori Butcher told WPXI.

She also posted on Facebook last month about hitting a deer while driving.

'Gotta love hitting a deer! Stupid car brings me bad luck!' She wrote.

The small community they come from was shocked by their deaths.

‘This event will have a lasting and far-reaching impact on our community with the lives on many people involved both directly and indirectly changed forever,’ the fire department said in a statement, according to WTRF.

Hancock County School Superintendent Sue Smith echoed those thoughts.

‘Our whole community, because it is close knit, and everybody does know everybody… it is just devastating for everybody,’ she told WTRF.
