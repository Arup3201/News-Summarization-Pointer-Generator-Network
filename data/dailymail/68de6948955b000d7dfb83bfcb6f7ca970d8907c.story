Falling on his own sword: Brett Ratner has resigned from producing the Oscars show next year over his recent gay slur

Brett Ratner has resigned as producer of next year's Academy Awards.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says the 42-year-old 
filmmaker submitted his resignation yesterday, one day after he apologised
for using a gay slur at a screening of his latest movie.

Academy President Tom Sherak says Ratner 'did the right thing for the academy and for himself'.

Sherak said: 'Brett is a good person, but his comments were unacceptable.'

Ratner was named Oscar producer in August along with TV veteran Don Mischer.

Ratner issued an open letter explaining his resignation.

It read: 'I called [the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president] 
Tom Sherak this morning and resigned as a producer of the 84th Academy 
Awards telecast.

'Being asked to help put on the Oscar show was the 
proudest moment of my career.

'But as painful as this may be for me, it 
would be worse if my association with the show were to be a distraction 
from the Academy and the high ideals it represents.'

Yesterday Brett apologised for using a gay slur during a question-and-answer session at a screening for his new film Tower Heist.

Ratner used a pejorative term to describe gay men in response to a question asked at a screening of his latest movie.

In his apology he said sorry 'for any offense my remarks caused,' adding that the slur was 'a dumb and outdated way of expressing myself.'

He said that 'as a storyteller I should have been much more thoughtful about the power of language and my choice of words.'

Initially Academy President Sherak said Ratner's remarks were 'inappropriate' - but said the academy had no plans to remove him from his Oscar-producing position.

Eddie Murphy, who worked with Brett on the new film, Tower Heist, was set to host the Oscars, but his role is now uncertain.

On Monday, Ratner also recorded an expletive-laden interview with shock jock Howard Stern.

In the revealing interview, he discussed oral sex, masturbation and the size of his testicles.

He admitted he was stunned he had never impregnated anyone because of his virility: 'How lucky I am that I never got a girl pregnant. It's crazy.'

He boasted a doctor had told him he had 10 times the sperm count of an average man his age.

He also claimed he asked Lindsay Lohan to get an STD test when they allegedly slept together when she was 19.

He praised her natural acting talent and claimed 'everything f**ked up about her is because of her parents'.

He said: 'I’m a hypochondriac. Before I go all the way, I send the girl to the doctor and check them for everything. My doctor has a test to tell if you’re going to catch something in the future even.'

It's not the first time Ratner has shocked with his brash commentary.

Ratner
recently admitted to having had a fling with Olivia Munn - who had 
apparently referred to him in her book Suck It, Wonder Woman!: The 
Misadventures Of A Hollywood Geek.

In one visceral and nauseating 
paragraph, Munn, 31, recounts walking in on the movie big-wig - who she doesn't name - while
he was pleasuring himself.

The
Daily Show comedienne recalls: 'A grown man in an oversized shirt 
holding his undersized manhood in hands glistening with shrimp fat.'

Speaking
recently on G4's Attack of the Show, Ratner revealed the man in 
question was him, in an apparent shameless bid to drum up publicity for 
Tower Heist.

He said: 'I used to date Olivia Munn, I'll be honest with everyone here. But when she was "Lisa".

'She wasn’t Asian back then, she was hanging out on my set of After the Sunset, I banged her a few times, but I forgot her.

'Because she changed her name I didn’t know it was the same person and so when she auditioned for me for a TV show.

'I forgot her, she got p***ed off, and so she made up all these stories about me eating shrimp and masturbating in my trailer.

'And she talked about my shortcomings.'

Ratner's bitter response is baffling, particularly his 'before she was Asian' comment as Munn is Chinese on her mother's side.
