This is the incredible moment hero workmen rescued a 98-year-old driver by LIFTING her car from tram tracks.

Left cold and shivering, the driver of the gold Renault Clio, more than half-an-hour for help after a wrong turn left her trapped on tracks. 

The pensioner turned left onto the new tram tracks, instead of continuing a few yards further to the main road and getting stuck on the tracks.

Passing workmen were able to remove her car from the tracks, manhandling it off the rails 

The Renault Clio, pictured, became marooned on the tram tracks after the lady took the wrong turn 

The lady was stuck in her car, unable to go forward or backward until help arrived. 

Removal man Stephen Brookbanks was passing the scene in Baguley, Wythenshawe, when he spotted the gold Renault Clio stuck on the tracks on Tuesday morning, shortly before 9am. 

Bystanders called Metrolink, who run the Manchester tram service, but after 30 minutes they decided to act themselves. 

Mr Brookbanks, with the help of a few of his employees and a couple of bystanders, rocked the car over the tracks to safety. 

He said: 'Me and two of the guys were passing by and saw her, she was old and frail and looked really bewildered.

'Two other guys, truck drivers, saw us struggling and came to help. The lady was very cold and she was walking with a stick.'

He added: 'It was heavy - the heaviest thing we've had to lift even in our job but we are used to it.

'You see an old lady on a track and you help. I haven't got a clue where the authorities were. She was there at least 30 minutes.

'She thanked us and was quite jolly by the time we left.'

The elderly woman was on her way to mass at the Sacred Heart Church on Floatshall Road, Manchester

The woman turned left from Royal Oak Road onto the tramline which runs along the side of the main road

Sandra Lynch, a resident who waited with the woman and got her a warm cup of tea, said: 'I was shocked and disgusted by how long she had been there.

'When we called Metrolink and the police we told them how old she was so I would have thought they would have got out to help much more quickly.

'It also obviously held up the trams during rush hour so I was surprised by that.'

Along with two other residents, Ms Lynch, who was walking her dog, waited with the woman.

She added: 'She was freezing cold, bless her - and all she was worried about was getting to mass.'

It was the second such incident in four days - after a car found its way on to the airport line on Saturday night.

Mother-of-two, Ms Lynch added: 'A huge thank you too all these people who were just passing in their vans - well done boys.'

'At no time did I see anyone either from Metrolink or the police, nobody official arrived.'

Ms Lynch, who said the woman had been on her way to mass at the Sacred Heart church on Floatshall Road, added: 'I walked her into church in the end and she made the last few minutes of mass.'

The incident meant trams from Manchester Airport could only get as far as Roundthorn for 40 minutes while Baguley stop was out of action.

A spokeswoman from RATP Dev Ltd, which operates Metrolink, said their safety team took 30 minutes to arrive from the Trafford depot. She said they left immediately but the journey took that long.

A GMP spokesman said they had a log for the call but that they understood Manchester council had removed the car.
