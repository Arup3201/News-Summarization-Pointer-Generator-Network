Five years ago, former NFL player Donte Stallworth got behind the wheel of his car drunk: it is a decision he has always regretted.

Stallworth served 24 days behind bars for fatally hitting a pedestrian, 59-year-old father Mario Reyes, in a drunk driving accident.

Although the sentence was short, he believes living with the impact of his bad decision has been far worse punishment.

On Friday, he marked the five-year anniversary of that horrific moment with a reflective post on Instagram.

'There's nothing I can do to reverse that day, but hopefully you guys will think of me and make better decisions than I did that morning,' he wrote in his Instagram post caption.

'You don't want to live with these regrets I have from my irrevocable decision... Trust me. #BeSmarter.'

On March 14, 2009, the then-Ceveland Browns wide receiver was charged with killing Reyes, a construction
 worker, who police said was running across the street to 
catch a bus when the drunk athlete hit him with his car.

Stallworth's blood-alcohol level 
after the crash was .126, well above Florida's legal limit of .08, 
according to results of a blood test.Â 

According to a police report, Stallworth was drinking
 at a club in the Fountainebleau hotel on South Beach on the morning of the crash.

He left to go to a
 nearby home - it's not clear if the home was one of Stallworth's three 
Miami-area properties - and then headed out to the causeway where Reyes 
was struck.

'I hit the man lying in the road,' Stallworth told 
officers arriving to investigate the crash, according to the affidavit.

Stallworth pleaded guilty to 
manslaughter while driving under the influence of alcohol in exchange 
for a lighter sentence. His charges carried a 10 to 15 year prison term.

However he was ordered to serve just 30-days behind bars because
 of his cooperation with investigators, the fact he remained at the 
scene following the accident and the wishes of the victim's family.

Stallworth reportedly reached a confidential financial settlement with Reyes' family.

Stallworth ended up spending just 24 days in jail.

'I am truly sorry,' Stallworth said at his DUI manslaughter sentencing. He also said he was 'grief-stricken' over the incident.

Authorities
 suspended Stallworth's driver's license for life and ordered him to pay
 $10,000 in fines and perform 1,000 hours of community service.

Back in the game: After the incident, Stallworth was suspended for the 2009 season, but returned to play for the Baltimore Ravens, Washington Redskins (pictured) and New England Patriots after being reinstated by the NFL
