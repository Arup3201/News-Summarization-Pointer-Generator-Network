A 22-year-old girl who has never had a boyfriend due to a decade of crippling insecurity has had a nose job in the quest to find love.

Fiona Todd, who lives in Farnham, Surrey, with her mother, hated the way she looked because of her nose ever 'since she can remember'.

At just 12-years-old, Fiona suffered cruel taunts from school bullies who picked on its size and shape, knocking down her self esteem.

Fiona has never experienced being in a relationship, and felt if she had nose operation she would gain the confidence to go out and seek love.

While she has 'always wanted surgery', Fiona finally booked herself in for an operation in March.

Two months ago, the public relations executive underwent a rhinoplasty procedure performed by cosmetic surgeon Nick Percival FRCS of Cosmetic Surgery Partners in London. 

Her family, including an older brother and sister, were concerned.

'I didn't really speak with them. They said I didn't need it done, but that's their point of view,' says Fiona.

'For a decade people have been making comments on it. It made me feel worse about it than I already felt. 

She says her nose made it difficult for her to talk to people or feel good about herself

'One boy at school would comment on it... My nose made me really lacking in confidence. It made it more difficult to talk to people or feel good about myself.

'Whenever I would meet someone new I would immediately think "Are they going to think I've got a big nose".

'It was the first thing I worried about. I would just feel really insecure.

'I'd always wanted the operation but in March this year I decided I was actually going to do it and booked myself in. 

'I wanted to raise my confidence and help me find a man.' 

Fiona went in in the morning, the operation was two hours, and was home by 8pm

Her close friends would say her nose was fine. But they would sometimes make jokes about it, and paranoid Fiona took these to heart.

'My friends were probably saying it was fine to be polite. They knew I hated my nose and wanted it done,' she says.

'I went for the consultation and Dr Nick Percival looked at my nose and what needed to be done, and explained the process. I trusted him on that - at the time that's all that mattered.

'I went in in the morning, the operation was two hours, then my friend came to pick me up and I was home by 8pm.

'When I first woke up I was in pain, but I was on painkillers straight after that.

'Two months on, the results are only going to get better.

'I still can't move the tip of my nose, it's absolutely solid. That can take 6 months to go down,' says Fiona.

'Some people say it doesn't look very different, but the surgeons do it so subtly so as not to make a drastic change. When I look at pictures before and now, that's when I really notice it. 

'While I feel much more confident, I haven't been on any dates yet - but I am very fussy and picky, I just haven't found the right one.

'I've tried dating sites but would rather meet someone in person. The operation has given me the confidence to actually go out and meet people and hopefully end up in a happy relationship.

'And when I am with someone one day, to not feel insecure about the way I look.'
