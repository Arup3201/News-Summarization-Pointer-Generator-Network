A five-year-old boy who fell from a fourth floor window was saved when he became wedged behind an air conditioning unit.

The boy was rescued by neighbours after getting stuck against the wall in the city of Shishi, in Fujian Province, China.

Wang Zhicheng left his son Wenbo asleep at home on his own to go to the shop. But Wenbo woke up whilst his father was still out and opened a window before falling out.

Luckily for him, he was stopped from plunging to the ground by getting stuck between the air conditioning unit just below the window and the wall.

A neighbour who first saw the boy said: 'Suddenly I heard loud baby cries. Looking out I was terrified to see a boy was struggling in the air, with his head stuck behind the air conditioner.'

Five neighbours rushed up to the boy's flat and broke in. One said: 'I grabbed the boy's head, preventing him from slipping down further.'

Meanwhile, the other three broke into the flat below so that they could lean out the window and support the boy's weight. The boy was eventually rescued 40 minutes later.

Neighbours rushed to pull the boy free from the unit as he began slipping towards the ground four floors below

Neighbours had to break into the apartments above and below the boy to get to him and pull him clear

The boy is eventually pulled to safety after the combined efforts of neighbours and fire and rescue crews

The boy's escape is remarkably similar to another dramatic incident in China in 2011 when a three-year-old boy fell from a eighth floor balcony and became trapped in the building's air-conditioning unit.

The unnamed toddler had also been left home alone in the apartment in Beijing, China, before he fell.

Neighbours, who heard him screaming, called the police for help.Â  But when they noticed he was starting to slip they decided to take the matter into their own hands and plucked him to safety.

The incident is remarkably similar to this rescue of a boy from behind an air conditioning unit in Beijing in 2011
