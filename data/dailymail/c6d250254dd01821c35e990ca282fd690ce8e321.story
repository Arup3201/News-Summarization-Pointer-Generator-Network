A Tibetan monk who posed for a selfie with London Mayor Boris Johnson was so caught up in the moment that it caused him to lose a laptop containing his life’s work.

Lelung Rinpoche, 43, was excited to find he was travelling on the same London Underground train as the mayor.

But after posing for a photograph, the expert on Buddhist scriptures grabbed his young son and left the train as he suddenly realised he had reached his stop.

Boris Johnson posed for a selfie with a Tibetan monk while on a train. Lelung Rinpoche was so caught up in the moment - he accidentally left his laptop, which contained his life's work, on the train. In the picture the mayor is holding what appears to be a copy of The Beano, the children's comic. It is folded to show a page headed 'PieFa', which may be Pie Face, who is a sidekick of Dennis the Menace.

It was only moments later that he realised he had left on the train his laptop containing nearly 1,000 pages of rare scriptures he had collected from around the world.

It was in a rucksack that also contained a camera, keys and his passport.

Since then, the bag has been handed in anonymously to London Underground staff and his camera, keys and passport have been returned to him.

But the all-important laptop, which disappeared as he travelled between Uxbridge and Eastcote on April 10, is still missing.

Mr Rinpoche, who had become engrossed in a deep conversation with Boris Johnson about Tibet during their brief meeting on the Metropolitan Line train, had nearly complete drafts of two books on the laptop.

The books aimed to help preserve ancient teachings which are under threat of being lost due to the political unrest in his Tibetan homeland.

Mr Rinpoche is the spiritual director of the charity the Lelung Dharma Trust, based in Eastcote, northwest London. His work featured in a BBC2 documentary in 2010 called Buddha in Suburbia.

One of the centre’s volunteers, Connie Dusek, who is on holiday in Majorca, said today: ‘The bag has come back, but not the laptop.

’I think someone has taken it in order to sell it on. Underground staff at Baker Street received the bag back with the camera, passport and bunch of keys, but not the laptop he needs so desperately.

‘They have no information on the person who handed it in. Perhaps they did not see who it was.’Mr Johnson had been in Uxbridge to attend a political event.

Mr Rinpoche, whose charity is offering a £500 reward for the laptop’s return, said: ‘I saw Boris on the train and he was two or three seats in front of me. Other people were having pictures with him, so I did too.

‘I thought he was a very modest person to take the tube and we talked about Tibet.

’He said he really wanted to visit. When I got off the train, he waved at me and I went on my way.’

The Tibetan, who had been travelling back from registering the birth of his baby daughter, added:‘Some of the work has taken months and months, and have been taken from different books.

‘The laptop had two book’s worth of material, around 900 pages that I had collected from around the world. I had visited libraries in countries like Mongolia to try to find any pages they have.

‘The two books were nearly at a stage where I could publish them. But I have lost almost all of it.’
