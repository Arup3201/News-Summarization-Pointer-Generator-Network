A man could be jailed for life for rapping about gang violence.

Brandon Duncan, also known as Tiny Doo, has been accused of breaking anti-gangster laws in California that make it illegal to profit in any way from gang activity.

Prosecutors are seeking 25 years to life in prison for Duncan, pointing to lyrics on his album which they say correlate to specific crimes by a known gang in Los Angeles, California.

Jailed for rapping? Brandon Duncan, aka Tiny Doo (left with his lawyer) faces life in prison if found guilty

According to CNN, Duncan and 14 other alleged gangsters were able to enhance their reputations following a spate of shootings in 2013.

Lawyers have pointed to violent scenes and imagery in his album, called No Safety, as proof that he should be convicted on nine counts of criminal street gang conspiracy.

Duncan has said the charges are ludicrous, and his defense has pointed out that he has no criminal record and is not even suspected of any actual gang activity.

He told CNN: 'The studio is my canvas. I'm just painting a picture. I'm not telling anybody to go out and kill somebody... these people [the prosecutors] have you scared to do anything around here.'
