Counter-terrorism police are investigating the hacking of a rugby league team website which was replaced with a page featuring the message: 'I love you Isis'.

The website of Rugby League team the Keighley Cougars was hacked last night and showed a black screen with the words 'Hacked By Team System DZ' at the top.

A message posted on the West Yorkshire club's twitter feed said: 'Apologies, the website has been hacked. The developers are working on it. Will let you know when it's back up and running.'

The website has since been restored. 

Gary Fawcett, Keighley Cougars chairman, has expressed his shock at what he called the 'sinister hijacking' of club's website. 

The website featured text including the words 'i love you isis' and had a recording of music and singing in the background.

The site also featured images of fighter jets which it refers to as 'warplanes of making America', pictures of the wreckage of 'Muslim homes' and bloody images of people injured in fighting. 

One of the barely comprehensible messages left on the site said: 'The alliance of all the world against the State of Islam will not succeed.'

Speaking to the Keighley News this morning, Mr Fawcett said: 'It's sinister what's happened and whatever organisation, wherever it is in the world should be using its own media, not hijacking other people's.'

He told the paper he was most worried about youngsters and fans who follow the Cougars might be exposed to some of the horrific images that were on left on its site.

'It is a concern that children might see some of those nightmare images,' he said.

He added that the website is hosted by a London company who were quickly contacted by one of the team's directors when the hacking came to light last night.

 A spokesman for West Yorkshire police said they had received a number of calls about the incident.

'We are aware of this incident and have now passed it to our counter-terrorism unit.

'We will work with the club in relation to this and are making enquiries.'

Posting on social media, one person claimed a host server had been hacked, leading to 60 other websites featuring the same page.

A resident of Keighley expressed concern over the financial details of those who have used the website.

He posted: 'Are the bank details of people who have bought season tickets merchandise etc from the online shop safe?' 

Hackers Team System DZ came to attention in July when they hacked 200 websites and posted a series of anti-Israeli messages. 

A website which appears to log all of their successful hacking attempts shows they managed to hack into nearly 200 websites from across the world yesterday- and shows British websites received the brunt of their attentions.

Last month they received international attention after they hacked into Canada's University of New Brunswick Student Union website using the same 'I love you Isis' header they used in this attack on the Keighley Cougars.

According to the National Post the message left on the university's website said: 'The state of Islam and the list expands, God willing… this time is a time of Islam and victory and lift the injustice for Muslims and the elimination of America and the allies of the infidels will not keep silent.'
