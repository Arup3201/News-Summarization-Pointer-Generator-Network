After twice failing to attend court to answer an allegation against her, Maria Jordan produced what she thought were her Get Out of Jail Free cards.

But the letters she claimed were from her GP and employer explaining why she was not at the hearings were less than convincing.

The note said to be from Dr Johal had no letterhead, was clumsily written in capitals and, most obviously, was littered with spelling mistakes – such as, ‘Majistrate’ and ‘A,E’.

Bogus: A clumsily written extract from the 'GP's letter' KFC worker Maria Jordan forged and handed in to court officials to explain why she hadn't been to earlier hearings

Jordan was jailed for three months at Ipswich Crown Court after admitting perverting the course of justice

One purporting to be from her boss at a
KFC outlet was just as bad, referring to ‘prove’ instead of proof and  
‘bussiness’ [sic]. Basic checks confirmed they were fakes.

She is now beginning a three-month 
jail term after admitting attempting to pervert the course of justice, 
even though she was eventually cleared of the original allegation that 
she breached a community order.

Sentencing her at Ipswich Crown Court,
Judge Roderick Newton said: ‘You actively intended to deceive the 
court. What you sought to do was deceive and lie.’ Jordan, 41, was due 
to appear before South East Suffolk magistrates in Ipswich on August 25 
for allegedly breaching her order.

Imposed for stealing £4,000 from her 
supervisor’s office at a Co-op store in June 2009, it involved 160 hours
of unpaid work at a charity shop.

A warrant for her arrest was issued 
when she failed to turn up for the hearing, and she was brought before 
the court on September 9.

Jordan, of Ipswich, said she had been 
involved in a fatal road crash, and was granted an adjournment to obtain
evidence to confirm her story.

The shift supervisor breached the 
order again the following month, and on September 22 missed another 
court appearance. A warrant was again issued, leading to her appearing 
before magistrates a week later.

But she still did not have the evidence she had offered to provide and the case was put off until October 6.

It is understood she then gave reasons
for the breaches that were accepted. The CPS refused to say what she 
claimed was wrong with her, but a source said it was of a ‘delicate 
nature’.

However, the authenticity of the notes
was immediately questioned by the magistrates’ legal adviser and 
Jordan’s surgery and employer, both based in the town, were then 
contacted.

Craig Marchant, defending, said: ‘She accepts her behaviour was short-sighted, misguided, foolish.’
