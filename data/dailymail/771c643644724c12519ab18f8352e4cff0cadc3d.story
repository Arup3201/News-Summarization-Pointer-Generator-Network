Glen Johnson may have played only two of England's last eight games - but he says he never doubted his status as the nation's best right back.

Johnson was always confident of wearing the No 2 shirt in Brazil, even when his form was blighted by fitness issues and Tottenham's Kyle Walker took possession of the role in the World Cup qualifiers.

'I've played every game I've been fit for in the last four or five years,' said the 29-year-old Liverpool defender. 'There was never a point when I thought I wasn't going to be in the squad. I don't think I've ever not been England's first choice.'

Taking on some responsibility: Glen Johnson (next to Wayne Rooney) is ready to set an example for England

Johnson 
won his 50th England cap against Denmark in March, easing fears raised 
by his Anfield boss Brendan Rodgers, who had claimed only a few weeks 
earlier that Johnson would be out 'indefinitely'.

Rodgers
 also admitted the right back's 'speed and fluency' had been affected by
 his determination to play on for the team with 'a real bad ankle'.

Johnson
 said: 'I was playing for two or three months with two or three injuries
 but they were never serious. With all three of them playing a part 
though, it was affecting how I played and my ability to run.

'We
 called a time-out and said I've got to get fit, get it sorted, but it 
was only ever going to be a few weeks, not a season-ending type of 
injury. I was never worried that much.

'Those
 injuries I'm over now and I guess it's a privilege to say you're the 
only naturalÂ  right back in the squad. But Roy knows he's got two or 
three who can cover the slot. I'm sure over the course of a tournament, 
everybody will be needed.'

Fighting to be fit: Luis Suarez is expected to be fit for the World Cup

Meanwhile,
 Johnson has confirmed that Luis Suarez has been in contact to say he 
expects to be fit to play against England in Brazil.

'He
 thinks he'll be fit,' said Johnson, who confessed to mixed feelings 
when he learned his Liverpool team-mate was winning his race to recover 
from a knee injury in time to lead the line for Uruguay in the World Cup
 finals.

Need coaching through: Raheem Sterling is going to his first major tournament and will be looked after

'He
 doesn't seem to think it's too bad. We've been talking by text. You 
don't want to see your mates injured but if he were to miss our game and
 be fit for the next one!

'He's

 clearly not one you'd want to play against in the World Cup, but I'd 
rather he be fit than injured. It's his dream to play in a World Cup and
 after the season he's had, he would be heartbroken not to be 
there.'players boasting 50 or more caps, along with Steven Gerrard,
