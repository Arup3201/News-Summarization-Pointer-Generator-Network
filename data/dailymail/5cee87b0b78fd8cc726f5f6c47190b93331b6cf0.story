Georgia assistant college basketball coach John Redman and his fiancee, Brittany Huber, were about to begin their life together as a married couple when tragedy struck Monday on their way to their wedding.

Redman, 23, and Huber, 25, were driving along Interstate 85 in Meriweather County, Georgia, at around 7pm when they were caught in a rainstorm.

According to Georgia State Police, Redman, who was behind the wheel, lost control of his 2008 IS 250 Lexus and crashed into the median at mile marker 33.

Twisted wreckage: Georgia State Police say Huber was killed on impact when Redman lost control of his 2008 Lexus IS 250 on Interstate 85  Monday evening

Too fast: Investigators say Redman was speeding in wet conditions, which caused the car to slam into a bridge abutment

The passenger side where Huber was sitting smashed against a concrete bridge abutment, killing the woman in impact.

Redman, an assitant coach at Dalton State University, was rushed to Grady Hospital to be treated for severe head trauma, broken ribs and other injuries.

‘Our thoughts and prayers are with her [Huber’s] family at this impossibly hard time. She was an amazing person loved by all who met and knew her,’ read a statement by Dalton State University Athletic Director Derek Waugh obtained by WECT.

The couple’s wedding was scheduled to take place in Huber’s hometown of Mobile, Alabama, Saturday, and the pair were on their way there when the fatal accident happened.

According to officials, Redman was driving too fast, and the slick road conditions did not play a role in the crash. 

Redman's Facebook page indicates that he and Huber had been together since the fall of 2011, and the couple got engaged last June.

Inseparable: Brittany and Redman met in 2011 and got engaged last June; they were set to get married Saturday in the woman's hometown of Mobile, Alabama

So in love: Huber had agreed to move to Georgia when Redman landed his dream job as assistant basketball coach at Dalton State University

In July 2013, the 23-year-old graduate of Spring Hill College was hired as assistant men's basketball coach at Dalton State. His fiancee worked as a kindergarten teacher’s aide at City Park Elementary School.

Everyone who knew Huber and Redman described them as an inseparable couple who could not wait to get married. 

Dalton State basketball player Tyrel Edwards recalled to News Channel 9 how during his recruitment interview Redman was gushing about his fiancee.

‘You could tell they were just really in love and ready to get started on their marriage and their future, so just a horrible, horrible tragedy,’ City Park Elementary School Principal Rick Little said.

Gifted: Huber, an aspiring artist, worked as a kindergarten teacher's aide despite her severe hearing impairment

Huber had a severe hearing impairment since she was a girl, but her students and people who met her for the first time often couldn’t pick up on it because of her uncanny ability to read lips, Times Free Press reported.

In college, she had started out studying finance but switched to an art major because she wanted to do something creative with her life.

The 23-year-old woman was interested in painting, pottery and photography, which could be seen from a Facebook page dedicated to her artistic endeavors, including her work with young children at a summer camp in Mobile last year. 

Redman’s mother, former LPGA player Susie Kirk, wrote a heartbreaking message on her Facebook page mourning her would-be daughter-in-law.

‘I miss my sweet Brittany! I am in shock!!!!!! And I do not think I can handle this terrible pain for Brittany's family and for John,’ she wrote. ‘It was Brittany and John. It was John and Brittany. End of story. They were TEAM REDMAN every day!’

Kirk said that her son was in ‘stable and comfortable condition,’ but remained on a respirator, intubated and heavily sedated.

A memorial service is being held tonight for Huber at Spring Hill Baptist Church in Mobile where the couple were supposed to walk down the aisle Saturday.

On the eve of their fateful road trip, Brittany wrote on her Instagram page: ‘I can't wait to ride on this journey with him and see what our amazing God has in store for us.’

The message was accompanied by a photo of the couple standing on opposite sides of a train track, with Redman handing Huber a basketball.

Long road ahead: Redman, the son of veteran LPGA player Susie Kirk, remains heavily sedated and on a respirator after suffering a head trauma and multiple broken bones

The young teacher’s aid explained in her lengthy post that the ball symbolized her fiance asking her if she was willing to help him achieve his dream of becoming a college basketball coach. 

On Monday morning, just hours before her death, Huber posted a photo of their small white pet dog traveling in the car with them en route to Alabama.

‘It is finally wedding week!’ the bride wrote excitedly.

When their Lexus smashed into a concrete pillar that evening, the first on the scene was a woman known to the victim's family only as Laura, whom their described as an 'angel.'

Redman’s mother told the Dalton Daily Citizen that when the Good Samaritan saw the unconscious couple inside the mangled car, she walked up to them and joined their hands before reciting the 'Our Father' prayer. It is believed that Huber was already dead by then.

Laura also came to the aid of the couple’s pup named Paige who was trapped in the smashed car, taking the animal to a veterinarian to be treated for cuts from broken glass. 

Brittany Huber leaves behind a brother, sister, her parents and a stepmother.
