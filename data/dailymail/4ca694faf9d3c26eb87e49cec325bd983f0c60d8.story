Mark Reckless, right, with his wife Catriona, said only the public sector elite supports Labour 

Ukip won in Rochester because the Labour Party now represents only the public sector elite, according to Mark Reckless.

The former Tory, who retained his seat with a modest majority after switching to Nigel Farage’s party, used his victory speech to tell supporters that Ed Miliband and his team were out of touch.

He said Ukip had become the ‘radicals’ of British politics, snatching votes from the opposition party.

He declared: ‘The radical tradition, which has stood and spoken for the working class, has found a new home in Ukip.

‘As Labour represents those comfortable at the top of the public sector, it is not Ed Miliband, but Ukip that represents the concerns of most working men and women.’

Ukip’s second member of parliament claimed that the poll in Rochester and Strood – which was deemed by experts to be only Ukip’s 271st most winnable seat – showed they could win anywhere in the country.

Meanwhile, Nigel Farage predicted another wave of defections to Ukip before the General Election, with party polling suggesting they could pick up dozens of seats.

Mr Reckless, who stood down in order to trigger the showdown with his former party, regained the Kent seat for Ukip with 16,867 votes, a majority of only 2,920.

Conservative candidate Kelly Tolhurst won 13,947 votes.

And Labour’s Naushabah Khan came third with 6,713 votes.

The Liberal Democrats continued a humiliating string of by-election performances, finishing fifth behind the Greens, and losing another deposit, with just 349 votes.

All three main parties saw their share of the vote fall compared with the last general election, with the Lib Dems down by 15.39 per cent, the Tories by 14.39 per cent and Labour by 11.7 per cent.

A total of 40,065 votes were cast, a turnout of 50.61 per cent.

Following his win Mr Reckless got an early train to London to be sworn in as an MP, and vote with Labour on a law to rein in private companies’ role in the health service.

Claiming victory just before 5am yesterday, Mr Reckless declared: ‘We will give you back your country.’ He also vowed to back low taxes, localism and independence from the European Union.

Mr Farage said yesterday morning that Ukip had made major advances in Strood, traditionally a Labour-supporting area, although Ukip also took votes from Tories and previous non-voters.

He said the party had not done as well in more affluent Rochester, where it had been ‘difficult’ to win over many middle-class Tory voters. Ukip’s first directly elected MP, Douglas Carswell, who represents Clacton, predicted the party could win ‘dozens’ more seats from Labour. He suggested his party could replace Labour as the main opposition by offering a modern version of the ‘free market, economically liberal’ administrations of William Gladstone in the 19th century.

Nigel Farage, right, took Mark Reckless' victory as an opportunity to claim that more MPs will defect to Ukip

Ukip’s latest victory showed that, by appealing directly to ex-Labour voters, the party has an opportunity to ‘undo the tragedy of the 1920s’, when Labour became the second party of British politics, he said.

‘So much of Britain is now run in the interests of various vested interests, there is an extraordinary opportunity for a new, free market, economically liberal party committed to far-reaching, radical political reform,’ said Mr Carswell. ‘Think of it as Gladstone dotcom.’

Mr Reckless faced an uphill struggle against his former Tory colleagues, as David Cameron made it his mission to keep the seat and ordered all MPs to make three visits there.

Earlier this week, the Ukip campaign was rocked by comments Mr Reckless made at a hustings. He suggested if Britain leaves the EU, migrants already settled in this country may have to be repatriated – although he later clarified this was not his view.

His victory speech paid tribute to the ‘more than a dash of support’ he had received from EU immigrants during the contest.

He added: ‘They are now here as part of our community and they will always be welcome.’

Mr Reckless was heckled by Labour MPs in the House of Commons yesterday as he defended his views on the NHS. He now wants to repeal a bill which he voted for as a Conservative.

Ukip have moved significantly leftwards in the past year as they have picked up more and more support among working-class voters in by-elections in the north of England.

They nearly won last month’s contest in Heywood and Middleton, Greater Manchester, a safe Labour seat in the party’s former industrial heartlands, coming within 617 votes of victory.
