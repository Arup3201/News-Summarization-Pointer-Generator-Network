A newly-built warship has taken its first step towards handover to the Royal Navy after leaving the yard on the River Clyde where it was built.

The type-45 Destroyer, Duncan, today left BAE System's Scotstoun yard in Glasgow for Portsmouth Naval Base, where it will be officially commissioned.

Duncan is the last in a 13-year, six-ship contract with the Ministry of Defence. The other Destroyers are called Diamond, Daring, Dauntless, Dragon and Defender and the fleet will serve the Navy until 2040.

Duncan's launch is the completion of a six-ship contract and the culmination of over a decade of work

The warship was due to leave last week but this was postponed because of technical problems.

Jennifer Osbaldestin, type-45 programme 
director at BAE Systems, said: 'Duncan is an outstanding vessel and we 
are all extremely proud to see her begin her delivery voyage to 
Portsmouth. After a very successful build period she will now become the
newest asset in the fleet.

'When the White Ensign is raised she 
will be formally handed over to the Royal Navy and will join her sister 
ships, completing the class of highly capable and advanced type-45 
destroyers.'

The warships can carry out a wide range 
of operations, including anti-piracy and anti-smuggling activity, 
disaster relief work and surveillance, as well as high-intensity war 
fighting.

Duncan's commanding officer, James 
Stride, said: 'HMS Duncan is a fantastic ship, offering a world-class 
air defence capability, and as we leave the Clyde I can reflect on the 
hard work from everyone involved in the build programme to get us to 
this significant moment.

'My team of Royal Navy personnel are all
very keen to take full custody of the ship once she gets into 
Portsmouth and starts her training and trials prior to deploying around 
the globe, protecting our nation's interests.'

Union leaders said the departure highlights the importance of partnership between shipyards across the UK.

Staff at BAE Systems watch the ship begin its ocean odyssey. Each type-45 destroyer cost £1billion

Jim Moohan, chair of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions and GMB Scotland senior organiser, said: 'Immense credit is given to BAE Systems, the employees and the trade unions for total commitment.

'The urgent requirement for change was not lost on anyone involved during the early years of 2000.

'The flexibility, interchange ability and transfer of labour between the yards were recognised and vital for job security and continuity.

'The final part of the jigsaw and the vision for the future was and remains political parties coming together as one on behalf of the few remaining yards, with survival being the aim.'
