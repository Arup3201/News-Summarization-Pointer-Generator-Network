When a new tourist map of Berkhamsted was drawn up, officials were hoping it would attract visitors to the historic monuments and picturesque pubs which line the canal.

The drawing of the Hertfordshire town - where the English surrendered to William, Duke of Normandy, in 1066 - was one of hundreds created by the Canal and River Trust in the past year to promote the nation's waterways.

But what really caught people's attention was its phallic shape - although tourism chiefs today defended the choice of map.

Rude route? The map was drawn by the Canal and River Trust in a bid to attract more people to the historic monuments and pubs of Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire

It points out the town's 11th century castle, the Canadian Totem Police and waterside pubs including The Rising Sun, The Boat and The Crystal Palace.

The map also highlights some local amenities, including local car parks and the nearest Waitrose.

However, the location of the landmarks has resulted in the outline resembling that of a giant penis - much to the amusement of Canal and River Trust.

Jonathan Ludford from the Canal  and River Trust, told MailOnline: 'The UK’s canals are a haven for people and wildlife and we’ve produced 100 maps of some of the top family friendly destinations. 

'It was pointed out to us that the map of Berkhamsted maybe looks a bit phallic. But canal maps are invariably going to be long and straight and sometimes they might have a couple of bulges at one end.

Waterway:
 The Grand Junction Canal runs parallel to the town's High Street and 
was completed in 1798, before it was extended to Birmingham in 1805

'We have over a hundred more maps for you to check their shapes. Fortunately everyone’s seen the funny side and so we’re not too deflated about it.' 

The Grand Junction Canal running through Berkhamsted was completed in 1798 and runs parallel to the High Street - which is lined with restaurants and bars.

The section - connecting the River Thames at Brentford to the town - was then extended to Birmingham in 1805, and became one of the main routes for goods to be taken from London to the North and Midlands.   

The new map was posted on the Facebook page of the town's Haresfoot Brewery and quickly attracted social media users who noticed the outline.

The brewery said: 'Great graphic by the Canal River Trust highlighting the three canal pubs in Berkhamsted.'

Location: The community is 30 miles north of London and its population is just over 16,000 people

History: Berkhamsted Town Hall was built in 1859

The story of Berkhamsted begins in 1066. William, Duke of Normandy, had defeated the English army at Hastings and he crossed the river Thames to meet a delegation in the town.

It was there that he agreed to take the crown and was where he was given the name William the Conqueror.

Legend has it that in between this meeting and William's crowning at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day of that year, Berkhamsted was the capital of England.

It became a popular holiday destination for Norman and Plantagenet kings and would became renowned for its the castle - which was built in the same year as the invasion.

It was an important battle station between the 11th and 13th centuries, but it was abandoned in the 15th century. All that remains are parts of the perimeter walls.

However it is now one of the town's most popular tourist attractions - alongside the Canadian Totem Pole on the banks of the canal and the restaurants and bars which line the nearby high street.

The area also boasts the Rex Cinema, described by Visit the Chilterns tourist site as 'possibly Britain's most beautiful cinema'. 

The town is 30 miles north of London and has a population of just over 16,000 people.
