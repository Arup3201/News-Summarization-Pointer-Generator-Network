A family who moved to a picturesque cottage halfway up a Welsh mountain is receiving a steady stream of visitors - namely Led Zeppelin fans.

Ecologist Scott Roe, 42, thought the tiny house would be an escape from the hustle and bustle of city life.

But because Led Zeppelin used it as a country hideaway to write Stairway To Heaven, Scott's family get visited frequently by rock fans on a pilgrimage.

Scott and Ruth Roe moved to Bron Yr Aur cottage with their daughter to get some peace and quiet. The house is where Led Zeppelin wrote their classic anthem Stairway To Heaven

The family are now often visited by rockers taking a pilgrimage to the property

One mystery rocker even stole the sign from outside the remote property where Robert Plant and Jimmy Page lived.

Father-of-three Scott said: 'They come from all over the world.

'One guy walked all the way here from Germany, foraging berries and sleeping in churchyards as he went.'

Stairway To Heaven was written by Zep frontman Robert Plant (centre) and guitarist Jimmy Page (right) and formed the centrepiece of their untitled fourth album, referred to as Led Zeppelin IV

Page and Plant wrote the song from a selection of tapes they recorded while staying at the cottage in 1970

Scott lives with wife Ruth and their daughter at Bron-Yr-Aur, near Machynlleth, Mid Wales. He told us: 'We love our home and are very lucky to live here.'

The property was bought by Ruth's father in 1970 shortly after the rockers moved out.

Led Zeppelin wrote much of their third album at the house and it is immortalised in the song 'Bron-Y-Aur Stomp' - although the band accidently misspelled its name.

Genius: Since its release in 1971 it has consistently ranked among the best rock songs of all time in polls

While staying at Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant recorded parts of Stairway to Heaven on a cassette player after the intro came to Page in the middle of the night.

They then took parts of the recording back to their fellow band mates who added the bassline and drumbeats.

The track was released as part of the band's fourth untitled album, usually referred to as Led Zeppelin IV, and while it was the stand-out track, it took two or three years for it to reach anthemic status.

Since then it has consistently ranked among the greatest rock song of all time in magazine polls, and in the US alone it is estimated it had been played 2,874,000 times on radio, enough to last for 44 years if run back-to-back.

It is perhaps not surprising then that Jimmy Page once called an Oregon radio station during a charity drive and offered to donate $10,000 if they promised never to play the track again, which the station agreed to.

In 1982 the song fell foul of the backward masking 'scandal' that affected many great rock songs of the time, as American TV stations alleged the song contained hidden satanic messages that could only be heard if it was played backwards.

Among the messages said to be hidden in Stairway To Heaven were 'Here's to my sweet Satan' and 'I sing because I live with Satan', which could allegedly be heard if the lyrics 'If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now...' were reversed.
