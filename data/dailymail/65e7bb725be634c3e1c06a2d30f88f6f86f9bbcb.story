And only ten models were made -  all of which had already been sold to American collectors before today's unveiling.

The blue convertible combines what Ferrari called its American customers' 'two great passions - the V12 engine and open-top driving'. 

The car is equipped with a 6.3-litre V-12 engine - giving it the power, smooth operation and distinctive sound synonymous with Ferrari's greatest models.

Producing 729 horsepower at 8,500rpm - it also allows the car to reach 62mph in just 3.1 seconds, Auto World News reports.

'The front of the car is dominated by the classic Ferrari single front grille with chrome finish and integrated air intakes for the brakes.'

The F60  makes history as the first new Ferrari in 23 years not unveiled under the stewardship of former chairman Luca di Montezemolo.
