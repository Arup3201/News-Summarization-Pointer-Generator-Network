A Massachusetts woman is tackling the overwhelming amount of snow in her town by shoveling sidewalks to make them accessible for all  -- and she's doing it all from her wheelchair.

Crystal Evans, 33, of Braintree suffers from a neuromuscular disease, but that hasn't stopped her from starting a business or a family, and it isn't stopping her from getting around Braintree, a city just 10 miles from Boston, which has seen more than 100 inches of snow this winter. 

Evans, a mother who runs a business from home making party supplies, told the Patriot Ledger that she was stuck in her home for three weeks because of the snow and couldn't get to the post office to mail packages to her customers.

So, she took matters into her own hands.

Tackling The Snow: Crystal Evans, 33, is tackling Massachusett's overwhelming amount of snow by shoveling sidewalks, making them accessible for all in her town -- and she's doing it all from her wheelchair

Can't Be Stopped: Evans, 33, of Braintree suffers from a neuromuscular disease, but that hasn't stopped her from starting a business or a family, and it isn't stopping her from getting around Braintree

'I realized I could put the shovel between my wheelchair and footrest and just go with it, and it plows it,' she said. 'I'm working to keep the sidewalks successful all winter.'

Since January, Evans has spent more than 100 hours shoveling, making Braintree's sidewalks passable with piles of snow as high as her head, AOL reports.

However, Evans' efforts aren't just about her. She said there are mothers carrying infants on the icy sidewalks and elderly citizens who live in the area.

The Ledger reports that Evans often spends five hours in one day shoveling and even comes out during snowstorms to break down icy paths.

Braintree is expected to get three to six inches of snow through Monday, according to AccuWeather. 

She puts up signs once a sidewalk is clear letting everyone know the path is now an 'accessible shoveled sidewalk.'

Her efforts have not gone unnoticed, her actions have inspired others to help out. Evans said people who drive by and see her working stop to help and once, one man even went and got a snow blower.

Evans said she has supplied shovels for the many volunteers who have stopped to help her and she has reached out for more volunteers on several of Braintree's Facebook pages. 

'Some help for a couple minutes; one kid came for three hours. We got a lot done,' she told the Ledger. 

Evans is part of a movement to change the nation's handicap symbol from a person in a wheelchair to someone in action, boldly taking charge, according to AOL.

'There is so much stigma of what people believe a disabled person is, they don't expect us to be working. They don't expect us to be out in the community,' Evans said. 

In a letter to the Ledger, Evans wrote that, in the face of excessive snowfall in the area, she hopes people choose to 'stop complaining and take to their shovels.' 

'Ensuring accessibility to our cities and towns is our responsibility,' she said.
