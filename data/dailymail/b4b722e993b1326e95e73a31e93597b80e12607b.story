Despite insisting that her full lips are natural, Kylie Jenner has sparked a huge craze for lip fillers and young women across the globe are attempting to recreate her look.

Last week, a swimwear model told how a DIY lip job ended in disaster when she tried to emulate the super pout of reality star Kylie Jenner by sucking into a hairspray lid. 

And now, a pair of sisters have found themselves in a similar situation after they sucked into a bottle in an attempt to achieve the look.

Two sisters, including Bir­gitta Ás, pictured, were left with swollen and blue lips after sucking into a bottle to try and give themselves a fuller pout. They posted pictures of the results on Facebook to warn other girls against trying the beauty trick

Yrja Ás Baldvinsdottir, 18, and her sister, Bir­gitta Ás, from the Icelandic capital Reykjavik, were left with swollen and blue bruised lips after testing the trick at home.

Writing on Facebook, Yrja As said: 'I wanted to warn people against do-it-yourself lip expansion, but was really surprised and shocked that it ended up being something that loads of people were copying.'

Speaking about the method, which involves sucking into the lid of a bottle, she said: 'I just wanted to try it and see what they would look like, I've never done it before, and I won't be doing it again. It was very, very painful. My lips turned blue.

'But af­ter we put our photo on the pop­u­lar Beau­tyTips Face­book page we've seen a num­ber of girls copy­ing us.'

Cosmetic surgeon Pordiis Kjartansdottir said she had never heard of the DIY method before, but warned against it.

'I can definitely say that this would be dangerous even just to try it, and especially if somebody does it more than once,' she said.

'The lips turned blue because blood fills up and they could easily become infected and lose all sensation. It is a really dangerous stunt and I'd advise strongly against anybody trying it.'
