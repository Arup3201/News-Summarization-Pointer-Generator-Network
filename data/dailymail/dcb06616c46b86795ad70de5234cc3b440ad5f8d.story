Judd Trump saw off home favourite Neil Robertson in the Australian Goldfields Open final on Sunday to secure his fourth ranking title.

Trump claimed the 75,000 US Dollars (£43,700) prize in Bendigo after wrapping up a 9-5 win.

The 24-year-old Englishman kept his opponent at bay having gone into the final session 5-3 ahead from the opening one.

Success Down Under: Judd Trump beat home favourite Neil Robertson 9-5 in Bendigo to claim the Australian Goldfields Open, the fourth ranking tournament of his career

It comes just over two months on from Trump’s World Championship quarter-final defeat to Robertson, who was looking here to win his home tournament for the first time and keep up the momentum following his victory in the recent Wuxi Classic.

Sunday’s first six frames were shared, with Trump making the bigger breaks of 50 and 71 before runs of 55 and 114 gave him the last two of the earlier session.

He began the second session by clearing from blue to black to secure a 6-3 advantage and then frames 10 and - with 101, his eighth century of the tournament - 11 also went his way.

Defeated: Neil Robertson, who beat Trump at the World Championships earlier in the year, was unable to come back from 5-3 down in the final session

Robertson rallied well, dominating frame 12 and also taking the next with a 109 break to further reduce the deficit.

But the 32-year-old Melbourne-born cueman could not make the most of his chances in the 14th and Trump potted the final blue to clinch victory.

Trump, quoted by www.worldsnooker.com, said: 'I played well throughout the week, although today was quite cagey.

'Even at 8-3 ahead I knew he was capable of winning six frames in a row - he did that against me at the World Championship. He started to go for his shots and they were going in, so I was a bit nervy because if it had gone 8-6 then the pressure would have been on me.

'The difference today was that I was nicking the tight frames. I was happy to be 5-3 ahead at the end of the first session, then I won an important first frame in the evening session.'
