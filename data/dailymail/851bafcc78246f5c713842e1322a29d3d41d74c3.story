Baby-faced crocodile hunter Gavin Hart has forged an unusual friendship with Europe's biggest croc.

He has been handling the prehistoric predators since he was just five and now spends his days up-close and personal with his 'best friend' - a 1,300lb crocodile, named Big Daddy.

Die-hard Steve Irwin fan Mr Hart set his heart on working with scaly beasts after watching the Australian reptile handler on TV.

Now 20, Mr Hart has realised his dream by snapping up a job at Crocodile Park in Torremolinos, Spain.

He is only too aware that one wrong move in the enclosure could be fatal but that hasn't tempered the keeper's affection for the half tonne monster.

Originally from Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire, Mr Hart said: 'There is no escaping from the jaws of a crocodile that big - but I love Big Daddy like someone loves their pet.

'Whenever I am at the park I make sure to greet him when I arrive.

Scaling the heights: Common across the southern hemisphere, crocodile encounters are rare in Scotland. Mr Hart had to relocate to Torremolinos to follow his dream to become a handler

'There is always a certain degree of risk involved as they are born wild and can never be tamed.

'At his size, if Big Daddy wants to hunt something he will hunt it and if he manages to catch it then it will be all over.'

The animals, which are normally found in the rivers and lakes of South America, Africa and Australia have a brutal reputation.

Big Daddy himself has already ferociously attacked his main rival at the park, another male called Rebel.

The rival tested the water, trying to become the aplha by tearing half of Daddy's tail off.

Talking about the savage attack, Gavin said: 'The young male, Rebel, was temporarily living with Big

In the wild, crocodiles can live anywhere between 35-75 years.

The reason crocodiles have that evil grin? Their mouth contains 80 sharpened teeth. Each of these full grown teeth has a smaller tooth on standby in case one is lost. They can replace each tooth up to 50 times throughout their lifespan.

Generally nocturnal hunters, they use their acute night vision to stalk prey. Unlike many animals, they can see colours too.

Crocodiles' ancestors go back to the cretaceous period. Modern snappers are thought to be around 200 million years old.

Crocs don't bite their prey to kill them, they clamp their strong jaw and drag them underwater to drown them.

Larger species such as Mugger Crocodiles (found in the Indian subcontinent) and are dangerous to humans, killing hundreds each year.

'Rebel was about 10ft long and we assumed that he would submit to Big Daddy.

'However, Rebel would often attempt to bask in Big Daddy's favourite spots or court his favourite girls much to the irritation of Big Daddy.

'Late one afternoon as the park was closing, Rebel decided he wanted to be the dominator of the pool and attacked Big Daddy from behind, biting his tail and using the death roll to cut off a yard from it.

'During the explosive fight Big Daddy pushed Rebel against the wall of the enclosure to expose the soft skin of his chest and ripped him open with a powerful bite.

But the monster got his retribution and Rebel's stuffed corpse now hangs in the visitor hut, a reminder to Gavin just how vicious he can be.

Asked if he fears attack himself the calm keeper says: 'If he is relaxed then I can stay with him 
for as long as I like, so long as I continue to respect him. I interact 
with Big Daddy to ensure our relationship is always a positive one.'

Close to snapping: Hart risks his life every day to look after Big Daddy but wouldn't have it any other way, he loves the bizarre friendship

Battle scars: Big Daddy emerged with half a tail missing following a scrap with alpha rival. He was 17ft long but now measures a still impressive 13.5ft
