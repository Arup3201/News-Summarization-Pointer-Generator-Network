A racist has been jailed for spraying ammonia into a man's eyes and threatening him with a dagger he had concealed in a walking stick.

Sadar Ahmad feared he would be blinded after Simon Southern approached him in a public park, took out a bottle of the caustic chemical and aimed it at his face, Newcastle Crown Court heard.

Southern, 26, then drew a 10-inch dagger from his walking stick and tried to goad Mr Ahmad and his friends into fighting him.

The court was told that he had adapted the crutch to protect himself because he felt threatened over the break-up of a relationship.

Shortly before the attack in Newcastle's Leazes Park, Mr Ahmad and his friends had heard a group of white men, including Southern, shouting racist slurs.

Prosecutor Stephen Duffield told the court: 'The defendant had a squeezy bottle which had ammonia in it and he sprayed that into Mr Ahmad’s face.

'Mr Ahmad immediately felt his eyes burning.'

Southern, who at the time was on bail for another offence, then sprayed the ammonia at one of Mr Ahmad's friends.

Fortunately, the second man was able to cover his face with his hands and protect himself.

Moments later, Southern pulled out the dagger.

Mr Duffield said: 'The weapon was concealed in the walking aid. It was produced and he used it to threaten the group shouting "come on, come on".'

In a victim statement read out in court, Mr Ahmad said that he had been left with badly blurred vision in his left eye, but a consultant at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary was confident that he would make a good recovery.

Newcastle Crown Court heard that Southern adapted the crutch to protect himself because he felt threatened over the break-up of a relationship

Southern, of Wallsend, North Tyneside, admitted grievous bodily harm with intent and possessing an offensive weapon.

The court heard that, at the time of the attack in September last year, Southern was already on bail for an affray incident in which he was caught with an axe in Wallsend.

Kieran O’Neil, defending, told the hearing that Southern had only recently been released from hospital after five weeks of treatment for a blood clot.

On the day of the attack he had mixed alcohol and drugs with a ‘cocktail’ of prescribed medication.

Sentencing Southern to six years in prison, plus an extended four-year licence period for public protection, Recorder William Lowe said the crime had a number of 'aggravating features'.

The recorder said: 'There was the use of weapons, there was an intention in my judgement to cause more serious harm than actually resulted, and the location was a public park where people of all ages spend their leisure time.'
