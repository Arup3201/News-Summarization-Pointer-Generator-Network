A father-of-three fined £1,300 for inflicting fellow residents to loud Celine Dion and Eminem songs claims he is the victim and says his neighbours have wrongfully blamed him for noise.

Jacek Korolko was handed a noise abatement notice by Bristol City Council after playing the music in his flat in Clifton Vale Close, Clifton, last year.

The council claim Mr Korolko, 33, persisted in playing his music, ignored warnings and twice breached the noise abatement notice he had been served.

At Bristol Magistrates’ Court last month the case was proved against Mr Korolko in his absence.

But Mr Korolko, who lives in his property with wife Dagmara, 34, and children Martina, 15, Claudia, six, and Oliwia, three, says far from being a nuisance it is he who is being hounded out by fellow residents.

He claims that since moving into the property 15 months ago his neighbours have shunned him, complained about the noise his children make and wrongly blamed him for dog mess and litter on the grass surrounding the flats.

Mr Korolko says since the complaints he has become increasingly stressed when his youngsters play indoors, has thrown out his stereo, sold his dog and makes his teenage daughter listen to music using headphones.

He admits listening to music loudly on three occasions - two of which were his wife and teenage daughter’s birthdays.

He said: 'I am meant to be living in freedom but it feels like sometimes we are in a prison.

'I can’t listen to music, I can’t let my kids play inside, I can’t have a dog, I can’t decorate my house.

'I feel stressed all the time. I think I have to think about changing my house but like the area I live.

'I feel like they want me and my family on the streets.'

Mr Korolko says problems started as soon as he moved in to the property.

He said: 'Almost straight away I was being asked why I was moving into a flat instead of a house.

'I was saying hello to people and they were just ignoring me. I felt like I looked like a monster or something.

'Then they would complain about my kids making noise playing. One time my wife came to the door carrying one child and the shopping and they deliberately shut it.

'Then a fox tears open bin bags and drags it across the grass and I am blamed for the mess, then a dog fouls in the garden and it has to be my dog.

'I don’t understand it. We are not bad people, I am not a terrorist or a bandit.

'But I listen to music three times and get a bill for £1,300.'

Mr Korolko said he could never afford to pay the charges as only his wife currently works and he had to return to Poland to sort out his father’s funeral.

A spokeswoman for Bristol City Council said that after several warnings they served a Notice under section 80 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 Section 80 Abatement Notices. Despite this the complaints continued and officers witnessed two breeches of the abatement notice.

John Sinnott, Environmental Health Officer, said: 'We warned Mr Korolko that he was in breach of the noise abatement notice and if he did again it would lead to court action.

'Neighbours have been very distressed at the unreasonable volume of music played often late at night.'

Mr Korolko was fined £500 for the two breeches of the abatement notice and ordered to pay £799.59 costs and £15 Victim Surcharge.

Cllr Gus Hoyt, Cabinet Member for Communities, Environment and Equalities said: 'Fines are always the last resort but local residents have the right to live without unreasonable noise from their neighbours.

'We have a policy of prevention and the officers we have do consult with those causing disturbances and there are plenty of warnings before we get to this stage.

'Sometimes - when residents refuse to co-operate - we have to take court action.'
