Chinese councillor Zhong Xiefei died after drinking rice wine while out at lunch on his first day at work

A Chinese councillor died on his first day at work after drinking too much at lunch with his new colleagues.

The deputy county chief in Guangxi suffered alcohol poisoning after indulging at lunchtime.

Local media reported that Zhong Xiefei drank rice wine with other provincial and county-level chiefs on his first day, April 9.

It is understood Zhong's family found him sleeping later that night, noting he was snoring loudly, giving them no cause for concern, reported shanghaiist.com.

But at 6am the next day, he was found dead in his bed.

On Monday, the authorities concluded that Zhong had died from excessive alcohol consumption.

The seven other officials who joined him to drink were fired.

In November an official from Heilongjjang province was suspended from the Communist Party after one of his party guests died from drinking too much at a banquet he had organised.

A month later, another official was suspended after a school visit descended into a drinking party leaving an administrator dead in Peng'am county, Sichuan.

President Xi Jinping's administration has launched a crackdown on similar events, trying to curb the number of extravagant banquets.

Since the action was taken sales of moutai have dropped significantly and wine has replaced liquor at official dinners.

Rice wine is made from fermentation of rice starch, converting it into sugars. It typically has a higher alcohol content - between 18 and 25 per cent - than wine made from grapes, which is between 9 and 16 per cent.

It is commonly used in Chinese and other Asian cuisine. A common substitute used is pale dry sherry.
