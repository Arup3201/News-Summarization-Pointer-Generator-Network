Tragedy: Giovanni Carlucci, 12, died when a lighting bolt hit his glasses

A 12-year-old boy, nicknamed Harry Potter because of his metal framed glasses, has been killed by a bolt of lightning in southern Italy.

Giovanni Carlucci died instantly when a freak storm struck the beach as he holidayed with his family in Campomarino di Maruggio, in the southern region of Puglia.

The lightning is thought have to have been attracted to the metal in his spectacles, which the schoolboy wore all the time, even when playing football.

The tragedy cannot help but recall the popular wizarding books in which the young Harry Potter is almost killed by a bolt of black magic, leaving him with a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead.

The storm struck with no warning on Monday afternoon as Giovanni played kickabout with his father. It hadn’t even started raining, local media reported.

When the bolt hit, he instantly suffered a cardiac arrest.

A retired doctor rushed to his aid but was unable to resuscitate him, the southern newspaper Gazetto del Mezzogiorno said.

The boy's 14-year-old cousin, Piergiorgio, was also struck but was successfully revived and is recovering from shallow burns and shock in hospital.

Giovanni's father, who saw his son die just metres away from him, cried out desperately for help witnesses told La Repubblica newspaper. 'He grabbed him by the head the leg the arm but he wouldn't move.'

'Then he stroked his hair and begged him to speak to him, to live,' the newspaper reported.

The father was himself taken ill and was admitted to hospital in a state of shock.

Nickname: Giovanni was frequently called Harry Potter, played by Daniel Radcliffe in the films based on the books, because he wore glasses

The Mayor of Giovanni's hometown, Altamura, near Bari today declared a day of public mourning. Mario Stacca said the town wanted to express 'the most profound sense of loss for the absurd death of little Giovanni Carlucci.'

He added: ‘It is not the time for words and moreover there are no words that can adequately express the tragedy that has struck his family’.

The tragedy comes as Italy continues to be battered by unseasonal storms which have caused flooding in parts and the closure of a Metro station in Rome on Sunday.
