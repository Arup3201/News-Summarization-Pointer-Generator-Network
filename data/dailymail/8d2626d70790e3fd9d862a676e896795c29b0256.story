Atletico Madrid will be on a revenge mission when they face city rivals Real in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup but Diego Simeone's side  has a different look to the one that suffered Champions League heartbreak at the end of last season.

Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has returned to Chelsea while star striker Diego Costa and defender Filipe Luis are also at Stamford Bridge.

David Villa has left Spain for New York via Melbourne but Mario Mandzukic has arrived from Bayern Munich and Antoine Griezmann joined from Real Sociedad.

Simeone has also brought in Jan Oblak, Raul Jimenez, Guilherme Siqueira and Miguel Moya.

Fighting fit: Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) should line up for Real Madrid against Atletico on Tuesday night

Real, looking to add to their early 2014-15 trophy haul having lifted the Super Cup in Cardiff last week, have boosted their squad with Colombia's James Rodriguez arriving after an impressive World Cup and Toni Kroos checking in from Bayern after winning in Brazil with Germany. Costa Rica keeper Keylor Navas left Levante to join Carlo Ancelotti's men.

Cristiano Ronaldo is fighting fit although there are concerns over Welshman Gareth Bale and Portuguese defender Pepe.

Atletico took four points from the two Primera Liga meetings between the sides last term on their way to being crowned champions while Real won 5-0 on aggregate over two legs in the Spanish Cup.

In Lisbon last May, the Champions League trophy looked to be heading for the Vicente Calderon after Diego Godin's first-half header but Sergio Ramos popped up at the death to force extra-time where Bale, Marcelo and Ronaldo secured a 10th European crown for the big guns.

Meanwhile, Ancelotti admits he does not know whether or not Angel di Maria wants to leave but the Italian coach is ready to play the Argentina winger.

Manchester United are ready to spend £100m on transfer fee and wages to land Di Maria but Ancelotti said: 'I don't want to enter into this theme so I don't lose focus on the game. Di Maria is available like all the others. He may or may not start the game and has opportunities, but like everyone else. 

'I don't know what Di Maria has decided. But I know that he's training and that he could help us. Until August 31 it will continue the same way and after that everything will be cleared up and things will return to normal.'

The return leg is on Friday night.
