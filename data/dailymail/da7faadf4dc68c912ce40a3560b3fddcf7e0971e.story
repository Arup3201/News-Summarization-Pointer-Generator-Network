There are few places in Britain you could take these spectacular images - the iridescent colours of the Milky Way illuminating the night sky.

But one photographer has found a perfect spot to capture the constellations in stunning definition - the pitch-black countryside of the Isle of Wight.

Astro-photographer Jamie Currie, 35, has been taking pictures of the phenomenon in locations across the island over the past 18 months.

Known for its low levels of light pollution, the idyllic island is a hotspot for stargazers to capture the immense beauty of the disk-shaped galaxy.

It contains between 100billion and 400billion stars but cannot be distinguished properly with the naked eye.

Mr Currie said: ‘I have always been interested in the night sky and wanted to try something different with my camera.

‘Astro was the way to go. The pictures were all taken on the Isle of Wight over the last 12 to 18 months. It’s turned into a bit of a labour of love. 

Illuminating the night sky: St Catherine's Oratory, which is the oldest lighthouse on the island - and is said to have been built in 1328

‘The Isle of Wight is very good for astro-photography due to the little light pollution on the south coast of the island.’

In what looks like a rainbow of stars arched across the night sky, one photograph shows the glowing band looming over St Catherine’s Oratory on the southerly tip of the island.

Another depicts Bembridge Lifeboat station below an explosion of luminous colours.

According to Mr Currie, a former Royal Marines Commando from the Isle of Wight, most of his shots are taken using a Canon 6D camera over a 30-second period with very high ISO - light sensitivity - levels to capture the Milky Way, which is just visible with the naked eye.

Mr Currie said low light pollution is crucial to capturing the galaxy on camera. He said: ‘I have been very interested in taking photos of the Milky Way over the last two years.

‘The light pollution on the Isle of Wight allows me to pull as much possible light into the camera to capture the billions of stars in the galaxy. It’s a truly astounding phenomenon.

'I would like to travel to the Yellowstone National Park in the future to capture the Milky Way at its very best as there is very little light pollution.’
