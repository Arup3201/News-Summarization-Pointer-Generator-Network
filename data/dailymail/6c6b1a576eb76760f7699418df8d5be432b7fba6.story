An art installation showing a film of naked people playing tag in a former Nazi death camp gas chamber has been withdrawn from exhibition in Germany.

Jewish leaders in Berlin were appalled that the Game Of Tag exhibit by Polish artist Artur Zmijewski was being screened in a city gallery.

The three-minute film shows men and women running around naked inside what at first appears to be a cellar.

Controversial: An art installation showing a film of naked people playing tag in a former Nazi death camp gas chamber has been withdrawn from exhibition in Berlin

Artist: Artur Zmijewski has defended his 1999 short - called Berek in Polish - as being therapeutic

Only towards the end does it become clear that Zmijewski has filmed them at two 
different locations - one neutral, the other inside a Nazi 
concentration camp gas chamber.

Zmijewski, 45, defended his 1999 short - called Berek in Polish - as being of a therapeutic nature.

He said: 'Instead of a tragedy, we see here an innocent child's game.'

The film was being screened at Berlin's Martin-Gropius Bau gallery as part of an exhibition titled 'Side By Side Poland - Germany: A 1,000 Years Of Art And History'.

Zmijewski specialises in making art 
videos he has described as being continuous social experiments that 
challenge the viewer's belief system, reality and memory.

Earlier this year, Newsweek described him as one of the ten most important artists in the world.

The
U.S. magazine acknowledged that his works are brutal and not for all 
tastes, but added that they are also 'profound and important and even 
humane, in the same way Goya's brutalities are'.
