The incident occurred near  the intersection of Osceola Street and Morrison road at around 8.20pm, 9News reports. 

No other details about the robbery were released, and authorities are offering an award of up to $2,000 for the apprehension of 'Baby Obama.' 

Inquisitr reports that Bowyer's nickname took hold due to his resemblance to President Barack Obama, perhaps during the president's younger years. 

Police say Bowyer should be considered armed and dangerous. 

Denver statistics show a total of 1,096 robberies and 2, 385 assaults occurred in 2014 though the percentage of robberies is down from the previous year.

Just two weeks into the new year, a string of armed robberies were reported prompting police to warn Denver residents to be on guard, the Denver Post reports.

Police say four robberies were reported in just one night just weeks into 2015 in two Denver neighborhoods, another was reported a day later. 

The Post reports that Denver police have asked Denver residents to be cautious, to walk in groups, and to be discreet with their valuables.
