A Texas Elementary school music teacher has been labeled racist after allegedly segregating his fifth grade class before telling the black children they were poorly raised.

Students at Hazel Harvey Peace Elementary school in Fort Worth told their parents about the offensive incident after it occurred on Friday.

The teacher hasn't been named, but the Fort Worth Independent School district said it was aware of the claims and would take appropriate action.

On the school's website it lists a solitary music teacher as Edgar Cajas, though the identity of the offending teacher has not been confirmed.

Mother Sandra Lee said her daughter told her about the incident as soon as she picked her up after school.

'He called the class stupid, and when he separated the black kids from the white kids, he told the black kids "I know where y'all from,"' Lee said her daughter told her, according to CBS News. 'He said "I can tell neither one of y'all get punished at home."'

Another student told the TV network that the teacher told him and some of his classmates to leave the classroom.

Lee went to the school Monday to report the 'racist' actions and remarks to administrators.

She said she was told that they were aware of what had happened and that all the students had written up statements about the incidents.

'It was racist,' Lee told CBS. 'Everything that was going on was racist. At that school, at that classroom, with that teacher, it was very racist.'

One parent told the TV network that students raised concerns about the music class earlier this year after watching a movie in the class with profanity and violence.

In a statement, spokesman Clint Bond said: 'Campus and District leadership have been aware of the allegations since last Friday. Once the facts are known, appropriate action will be taken.'
