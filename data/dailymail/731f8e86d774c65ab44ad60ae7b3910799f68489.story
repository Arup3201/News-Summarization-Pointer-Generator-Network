A Liberal Democrat bid to make it illegal to cut aid spending from present levels was a step closer last night – despite noisy opposition from some Tory MPs.

The Commons approved legislation to enshrine in law the principle that spending on international aid must never fall below 0.7 per cent of national income.

The controversial bill to gold plate Britain’s annual £11.5billion aid budget now goes to the Lords and could become law within months.

One Tory MP spoke for 75 minutes in an attempt to stop the private members’ bill being passed, but in the end a promised rebellion of Conservative backbenchers never took place. Just five voted against the legislation.

The bill was proposed by Michael Moore, the former Lib Dem Scottish Secretary, and was supported by the front benches of all three main parties.

Britain has already reached the Coalition’s 0.7 per cent target, and Tory ministers have said there was no need to enshrine it in law because the target has already been met.

But, during yesterday’s debate, Tory backbencher David Nuttall said the law would mean that people would not give to charity – as they would see it as the government’s job.

He said: ‘This country and the people of this country have a long and proud history of giving generously to charity and long may that continue.

‘But there is a danger, is there not, that some, not all, but some might think that by enshrining the 0.7 per cent figure in statute that the Government is doing their job for them.

‘I'd like to see people feel that it is their responsibility, as well as a matter of charity and an act of charity, to give to international aid charities.’

A series of votes were won during report stage by majorities of more than 140 as just a handful of MPs dug in and attempted to frustrate the Bill's progress.

But following a closure motion to halt the final debate, third reading on the Lib Dem MP's Bill was agreed by 146 to five, majority 141.

The Bill will now be sent to the House of Lords for further scrutiny. If it is amended and returned to MPs, there are five more days before the election to agree a finalised Bill.

If peers make no changes and pass the Bill, it will become law. The Bill legislates to make the aim of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas development a legal requirement.

Speaking during the third reading debate, International Development Minister Des Swayne reiterated the Government's support for the Bill and said it was a ‘timely Bill in the face of an enormous humanitarian crisis across the world’.

Prime Minister David Cameron backed the bill, but did not take part in today's Commons vote

Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said Britain's international development spending was not only ‘morally right’, but in Britain's national interest.

She added: ‘Few votes in this place can with certainty be said to save millions of lives. This one will.’

Introducing the debate, Mr Moore said: ‘By enshrining this commitment in law, the parties represented in this chamber honour the election commitments of 2010, the Coalition honours the Coalition Agreement.

‘But perhaps more importantly than either of those, we give predictability to our aid expenditure, critically for our partners and the recipients of the assistance.

‘We show leadership internationally which can be used to press other rich countries to join us, the first G7 country to reach the UN target and we move the debate on to focus on how we allocate our overseas development aid, not how much we spend on it.’

Philip Davies, the MP for Shipley, said: 'Overseas aid is the taking of money from poor people in rich countries and giving it to rich people in poor countries'

The Bill was bitterly opposed by a handful of MPs on the Tory backbench, producing a stubborn minority of between four and six votes on a series of divisions during the day.

Mr Nuttall, MP for Bury North, began proceedings with a report stage speech that ran to almost an hour, arguing there was no reason for international development to be uniquely protected.

Shipley MP Philip Davies spoke for 75 minutes and said: ‘For lots of people around the country, they feel that overseas aid is the taking of money from poor people in rich countries and giving it to rich people in poor countries.

‘What they see is millions of pounds siphoned off by dictators around the world for a new fleet of Mercedes or whatever it may be and think the Government may as well include a Mercedes catalogue with the aid they are giving to some of these countries.

‘My concern about overseas aid spending... is that first of all it doesn't actually work. We have been pouring billions and billions of pounds into countries in Africa which are no further on than when we started pouring billions and billions of pounds into them.’ 

Conservative commitment to the legislation – promised in the party's 2010 manifesto and included in the coalition agreement – has been undermined by Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond who described it as a ‘bizarre idea’.

With experts warning that the Government's latest economic blueprint will mean spending cuts in the UK ‘on a colossal scale’, David Cameron is under mounting pressure from many Tory activists, as well as Ukip, to remove the ring fence protecting aid from cuts.

Dissent over the scale of spending will be further inflamed by the need for the Government to find more money than expected to meet the target because of a recent recalculation of GDP that pushed the UK's national wealth higher.

Downing Street said the Prime Minister supports the Moore bill, but was not intending to take part in the Commons vote.

‘He will be in his constituency,’ said a Number 10 spokeswoman. ‘It is usual practice for the Prime Minister to spend Fridays in his constituency.

‘He thinks this is an important commitment, it is right that we help the poorest people in the world and it is right that we stick by the promises made to them to do it.

‘He believes that there should be support for the Bill and he is confident that it will probably go ahead.’
