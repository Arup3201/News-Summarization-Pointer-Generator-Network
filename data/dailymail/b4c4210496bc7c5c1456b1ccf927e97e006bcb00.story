Celtic have vowed to appeal a seven match ban handed to Aleksandar Tonev after he was found guilty of racially abusing Aberdeen's Shay Logan.

The Bulgarian winger, who is on loan at Parkhead from Aston Villa, was hit with the punishment following a five-hour disciplinary hearing at Hampden on Thursday.

Tonev and Logan were direct opponents during a 2-1 win for Celtic over Aberdeen at Parkhead in September when Englishman Logan told referee Bobby Madden the Bulgarian had called him a 'black c***'.

The defender also reported the alleged incident to his captain, Mark Reynolds, and Aberdeen boss McInnes.

Tonev vehemently denied the allegation but was hit with an SFA charge and was accompanied to yesterday's hearing by Celtic assistant boss John Collins.

Tonev left Hampden without comment but Celtic later released a statement, insisting they accepted Tonev is not a racist and that they would fight his corner.

A Celtic spokesperson said: 'Racism has no place in football and as a club for all people, Celtic absolutely abhors racism of any kind.

'This was a very unfortunate case, but the Club has accepted Aleksandar's explanation that he did not say the words that were alleged to have been said and that he is not a racist.

'We are, therefore, very disappointed by the outcome today and can confirm that Aleksandar will be appealing this decision.'
