David Walter, of Wroxham, Norfolk, died as he dashed to help others in the sea at Murcia in south-eastern Spain

A retired British police officer has died after rushing to help swimmers in trouble off the Spanish coast.

Watersports enthusiast David Walter is thought to have drowned when he dashed to help others in the sea at La Manga in the Murcia region of  south-eastern Spain.

The 67-year-old, who served with Norfolk Police for 30 years, was in Spain with his wife Mel, 53, after they had travelled all over Europe in their caravan for the last two years.

No-one else is thought to have been injured or killed in the tragedy on Monday.  

His wife was said to be devastated last night as tributes poured in for the popular ex-policeman.

Close friend Terry Hughes said Mr Walter had spotted a group of people struggling in the water and selflessly jumped in - but got into difficulty himself.

Mr Hughes said: 'Dave died doing what he did best - helping people. I wouldn't expect anything different of him.

'He would go out of his way to help other people whether it was people he knew or didn't know.'

He said Mr Walter and his wife, who used to live in Wroxham, Norfolk, had wanted to travel following his retirement.

They had spent much of the past couple of years in a caravan abroad.

Mr Walter had also been a kayaking instructor with local scouts.

Chief Constable of Norfolk Police Simon Bailey said today: 'Our thoughts are with Dave's family at this very difficult time.

'I knew him personally when he was a member of the constabulary and he had a very successful career as a detective within CID until he retired in 2000.

'The fact that Dave put his life on the line to help save someone else reflects the type of officer and person I knew he was.' 

Mr Walter spent much of his police career on traffic and as part of the stolen vehicle investigation branch of CID. 

Paul Ridgway, chairman of Norfolk Police Federation, said Mr Walter would be 'greatly missed'. 

Helen Wickens MBE, secretary of the Norfolk branch of the National Association of Retired Police Officers (NARPO) and office manager of Norfolk Police Federation, said: 'Dave was a member of NARPO and it was really sad to hear the tragic news of one of our members.

'In his retirement from the service he had done a great many things and was clearly out in Spain doing something he had always loved because he loved to travel. It's just a tragedy.'

The pensioner was also an examiner with the Norfolk and Norwich branch of the Institute of Advanced Motorcyclists (IAM).

Today branch secretary Martin Woodhouse said: 'He was an examiner for IAM for many years and we're sorry to hear the bad news.

'Dave gave his time in lots of things and he was very supportive in what we did in the road safety field. 

'He will be sadly missed for all the help and support he gave us.'

Mr Walter was also involved with Norfolk Advanced Motorcyclists (NAM) and a volunteer cyclist instructor with Norfolk County Council (NCC).

Iain Temperton, the council's team manager of casualty reduction, tweeted: 'Sad to hear that NCC volunteer cyclist instructor, Dave Walter, has drowned off the coast of Spain.

'Our heartfelt sympathy to his family.' 

A British funeral director based in Murcia said his body would be returned to the UK. 

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Murcia, Spain on 27 October, 2014.

'We stand ready to provide consular assistance.'
