Diego Maradona thinks Iker Casillas is no longer the world class goalkeeper he once was, and even says that Jose Mourinho was right to drop the Real Madrid captain during his time in the Spanish capital.

Spain captain Casillas was at fault for two goals as Spain were routed 5-1 by Holland on Friday and there were even questions as to whether Manchester United's David De Gea should replace him in goal for the world champions.

And the 33-year-old Real Madrid man was caught out in the Champions League final for Diego Godin's opener that almost cost his club their La Decima title in Lisbon.

Flop: Casillas' invincible aura is slipping and after a decade at the top he is now under fire from all angles

Casillas has undergone a tumultuous couple of years at Madrid where he was undisputed number one for more than a decade before Jose Mourinho cut him from his preferred starting line-up in favour of Diego Lopez.

Last season under Carlo Ancelotti he failed to regain his place - aside from in cup competitions - and now one of the game's greats is questioning his ability.

Maradona, winner of 1986 World Cup with Argentina, told Telesur that he felt the Real stopper was no longer one of the top players in his position.

'He had the worst game I've ever seen in my life,' he said. 'It reminds me of what my friend Mourinho told everyone about him.

'He said Casillas wasn't the right keeper and he paid for that. He had to leave, but in the end it turns out that Mourinho was right.'

Smug: According to Maradona, Mourinho was right all along about Casillas' ability as number one

Mourinho, now back in England as Chelsea manager, quit Real at the end of the 2012/13 season with his relationship with the players in tatters, according to reports in Spain.

But Maradona's words and Casillas' decent performances in two of the biggest games of the season will leave the Portugese boss feeling justified in his decision.

Casillas has been linked with a move to Arsenal this summer as he looks to re-establish himself as a first choice goalkeeper in Europe.
