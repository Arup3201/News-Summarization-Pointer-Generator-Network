This is the moment a member of the RAF Falcons parachute team crashed into an 82-year-old woman who was watching them during an air display.

The injured woman was flown to hospital after the parachutist landed on top of her at Weston Air Festival, in Somerset yesterday.

The parachutist, part of the RAF Falcons team, suffered minor injuries after missing the drop zone.

The woman was taken to Southmead 
Hospital in Bristol with a suspected fractured pelvis, a spokesman for 
South Western Ambulance Trust said.

Event manager Darren Fairchild said the show continued after the incident.

The RAF Falcons Display Flight is based at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.

Mr Fairchild said the military and health and safety executive have been notified.Â

Nicholas Hayman was at the event when the parachutist appeared to be heading straight for a burger van

Witness Nicholas Hayman from Weston was enjoying the event when the accident happened around 1.20pm on Sunday.

'I was snapping away and as the last chap on the stack came down he hit the burger van.

'There was a massive thump and everyone went silent.'

A
 spokesperson for Avon and Somerset Police said an air ambulance 
attended the scene and was assisted by police cadets who cleared a space
 for it to land.

The team was originally formed in 1961 by six instructors from the Parachute Training School at RAF Abingdon.

The group, originally nicknamed The Big 6, made their debut display at the Farnborough Air Show in 1961.

The demands became so overwhelming that in 1965 it was decided to increase the size of the team to twelve men.

At this point the team was renamed the RAF Falcons, taking the name from a bird of prey which represented their displays; swift, swooping, elegant and aerobatic in flight.
