Nearly a month's rain could fall in parts of Britain by tomorrow as experts warn this winter's storm weather is shrinking the UK's coastline 10 times faster than normal.

Forecasters say the wet and windy conditions will continue in the north-west tonight with gusts of wind reaching 70mph in parts of the UK.

Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said: 'There will be an awful lot of rain but the places that will see the most will be on the tops of hills in Cumbria and in largely unpopulated areas.

'The average rainfall for Cumbria in February is usually around 100 to 105mm and we forecasting that by tomorrow morning 80mm may have fallen in these areas.

'However in most places it's likely to be more like 20 to 30mm. In the south there will be not an awful lot of rainful, it will be mostly dry and mild.

'Going forward into the week the weather will continue to be unsettled, it will be blustery, windy and a mixture of sun and showers for most of the UK, but temperatures will remain mild.'

'Parts of north Wales, such as Snowdonia, may also see heavy rain like this and coastal areas will continue to see high winds of 60 to 70mph.

Three severe Met Office rain warnings remain in place and the Environment is continuing to warn about flooding in 48 areas.

Meanwhile, experts have said Britain's coastline will shrink 10 times faster this year following the storms - eroding by metres rather than centimetres.

Hundreds of miles of English and Welsh coast are expected to recede by up to a staggering three metres this year, putting the homes and livelihoods of thousands under threat.

Research by Plymouth University has found the expected rate of erosion of 20cm to 30cm per year is likely to jump to between two metres to three metres after huge waves have battered coastal towns this winter.

As cliffs have crumbled under the weight of relentless rainfall, the depth of sand on beaches has risen dramatically and is two metres higher than usual in places, according to a study.

A team from the university has used state-of-the-art equipment, including seisometers and thermal cameras, to record changes to Cornwall's coastline over the past three years in what is thought to be one of the most far reaching studies ever undertaken.

The latest results worryingly reveal the level of erosion is up to 10 times worse after Britain's wettest winter on record.

Professor Gerd Masselink, who is studying the erosion in Cornwall, said: 'On average this coastline near Porthleven retreats by 20 to 30cm per year.

'But this year's continuous gale force winds and giant storms have taken their toll and we're looking at losing between two and three metres.'

Hundreds of miles of England and Wales' coast is made up of similar sandy beaches and cliffs.

Meanwhile, EA chairman Lord Smith was accused yesterday of ignoring local advice about flooding on the Thames.

Cllr Colin Rayner, who represents flooded Wraysbury in Berkshire, said he warned the agency the river needed dredging as far back as 2009, but was ignored.

The flooding has been so bad it is even threatening this year's Oxford-Cambridge boat race with Oxford's team fearing it is falling behind in training.

James Cracknell, the British rowing champion and double Olympic gold medalist, who lives close to the Thames at Chiswick, says conditions are 'hardly ideal' with the tidal stretch of the river flowing so quickly from Richmond down.

'I suspect it is Oxford who are making more of a fuss about it as they have things a lot worse than Cambridge has at Ely' he said.

'If the Oxford team has to train indoors on rowing machines because they can't go out on the river, it isn't a great feeling knowing that Cambridge are out on the water, but they must not think about the opposition. With outdoor events, these things happen.'

Organisers say the historic race will only go ahead if the Thames is judged to be safe - not just for the crews but for thousands of spectators who line the banks to cheer them on.

Oxford University's crew members have now been unable to get out on the river for training sessions between Osney and Iffley Locks for more than 60 days because of the floods.
