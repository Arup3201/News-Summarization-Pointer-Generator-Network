CLICK HERE to read the reasons behind Micah Richards' training ground row with Mario Balotelli 

Micah Richards isn’t your typical Brit abroad. He isn’t in Italy just to party. He’s here, in Florence, to rebuild his once burgeoning reputation.

The defender once heralded as the undisputed successor to Gary Neville’s England right back slot has had 18 months to forget.

There are various theories to explain Richards’s fall from grace. Injury is one; the form of Pablo Zabaleta another.

The former Oldham Athletic defender said he feared for Manchester City's young academy graduates

Former Manchester City boss revealed his superstitious side when he banned players from wearing purple at the club.

The 49-year-old believed that the colour brought bad luck. 

His failure to convince Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini of his abilities is, perhaps, the most pertinent reason.

Speaking for the first time since calling time on his 12-year career at City, Richards provided his own account of why he feels his career has hit a brick wall.

‘I don’t have any bad feelings towards the club. They put me on the map and gave me a chance when I was 17,’ said Richards. ‘But I do have bad feelings towards the playing time (I was given). For any player, when you’re not playing it’s frustrating. When Roberto Mancini was in charge, he would rotate the full backs.

‘When we won the league in 2012, I played more than Zabaleta. So, I feel as though I could have been given more chances to play (under Pellegrini). I felt like I had improved and that I could do it at that level.’

Richards, who also revealed his hope of breaking back into England contention, admits he has doubts over whether City’s current youngsters will ever emulate his achievement of breaking into the first team.

Dedryck Boyata, a Belgian, is the only ‘club-trained’ player in City’s Champions League squad.

‘It’s going to be hard for them to come through. If you look at the squad now there’s 22 international players,’ Richards said. ‘You’re going to have to be extra special to get through. Hopefully, the new facilities they are building will help to bring young players through. It would be nice to see more coming from the academy, but the standard’s pretty high now.

‘The manager [Pellegrini] always said if you’re good enough, you’ll get a chance. I hope he sticks to his word. But I decided I wanted to go somewhere where I had the opportunity to be No 1.’

Micah Richards said that when he spoke to representatives from Fiorentina they made him feel very welcome

He’s got that chance now, amid the plush surroundings of Tuscany. The prospect of playing on the same flank as Colombia’s World Cup sensation Juan Cuadrado this season has re-invigorated the defender.

Richards was chirpy at his official unveiling at the Stadio Artemio Franchi; his difficult 18 months now a bygone chapter. His season-long loan to Fiorentina, however, has come at considerable emotional expense.

Facts and figures show that Micah Richards' career has taken a down turn at the Etihad Stadium

The 26-year-old is very close to his family; leaving them back in England has been a huge wrench, according to those close to Richards. But he wanted it this way. The hard way. He could easily have stayed in the Barclays Premier League — his comfort zone.

Richards had a firm loan offer from West Ham, who made their interest known in the defender just hours after their opening-day defeat by Tottenham.

Likewise, Richards could have easily sat back and picked up his £70,000-per-week salary at the Etihad Stadium, knowing full well he’d have virtually no chance of playing and that his contract ran out at the end of the season.

Micah Richards took a pay cut to join Fiorentina so he could get appearances instead of being a substitute

September 28 Torino (A)

October 2 Dinamo Minsk (A, Europa League)

But his mind was made up. The move to Fiorentina had been in the pipeline for three weeks. As discussions between the Serie A club and Richards’s representatives progressed, the more the defender’s eyes widened.

‘I had interest from English clubs, Man City offered me a five-year contract to stay, but for me I wanted to come somewhere I could make a fresh start,’ he said.

‘A lot of players in England just want to stay but I wanted to play abroad, I’ve always wanted to do that. This was the best option for me. I watched Italian football on TV, the pace looks slower, but more technical.

‘Teams look after the ball a bit better. That’s what Italy is known for and tactically I want to improve my game.

‘For example, sometime in games you can fizzle games out, I learned that under Mancini. I learned a lot from Mancini and he is one of the reasons I came here, too.

Micah Richards decided to leave Manchester City having been there since 2001

But even with the Florence sun beating down on him yesterday, rainy Manchester was never too far from his thoughts.

‘Leaving City was always going to be sad after 12 years, it was hard for me to leave because I know nothing else but Manchester City,’ he said.

With the influx of big-money foreign signings, you wonder where City’s next Micah Richards is coming from.
