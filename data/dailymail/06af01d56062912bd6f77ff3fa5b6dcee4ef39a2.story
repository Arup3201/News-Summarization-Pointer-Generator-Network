The race for the New Hampshire Senate seat is too close to call after shock polls suggested that the Republican candidate - former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown  - has a one-point lead. 

The virtual tie raises the prospect that he could pull off a surprise win tomorrow in his race against sitting New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.

Pollsters for New Hampshire television stations NH1 and WMUR discovered that Republican Brown is neck and neck with Democrat Shaheen, and either candidate could claim victory in tomorrow's election.

'This one is way too close to call. Things that happen over the next couple days could certainly make the difference,' WMUR's poll-taker, Andy Smith of the University of New Hampshire survey center, said.

In a last-minute push to turn her supporters out to the ballot box, Shaheen brought in presumed 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to give her campaign a boost on Sunday.

Clinton, who had not campaigned in the state since she ran for president in 2008, reportedly drew a crowd of 700 people and packed the gymnasium of Nashua Community College.

There she gave her now familiar midterm stump speech, in which she invoked her granddaughter Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky and encouraged the audience to back the reelection efforts of the top Democrats on the ballot in New Hampshire tomorrow if they want their children and grandchildren to have the opportunity to live out the American Dream.

Republicans, on the other hand, she said, are 'trying to instill fear. They’re staking everything on it.'

'Fear is the last resort of those who have run out of ideas and run out of hope,' Clinton added, according to the Boston Globe, noting that New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan and Shaheen are 'fearless.'

Touting her support for female-friendly policies, Clinton again claimed that 'women’s rights, here at home and around the world, are like the canary in the mine'.

'You start taking away, you start limiting women’s rights, who’s next?' she asked.

The New Hampshire Republican Party pushed back on Clinton's speech on Sunday and attempted to tie both her and Shaheen to the Democratic Party's beleaguered leader, President Barack Obama.

The women 'share one thing in common — they have both supported Obama’s failed leadership', New Hampshire Republican State Committee Chairwoman Jennifer Horn said in a statement after the event.

She similarly told the Boston Herald that Obama’s policies 'have failed, and they have failed with particular pain here in New Hampshire'. Especially when it comes to the effects of Obamacare, which has cost 20,000 New Hampshire residents their healthcare, and the economy, which is 'sluggish at best' in the Granite State, she elaborated.

Brown rallied volunteers at his campaign headquarters by doing push ups. A poll released today shows Brown leading Shaheen by a single digit, while another survey that came out this morning has Shaheen two points ahead of him

Horn also disputed reports that the Clinton spoke before a packed house. If just 700 people attended the event, that 'must have been disappointing,' she told the Herald, because the Democratic Party 'booked a space that could hold at least twice as many.'

'Certainly I think that everybody in the community is surprised at the turnout, and it doesn’t seem to have created quite the energy that maybe they had hoped for,' she continued. 

'I would suggest that having Hillary Clinton there is the next best thing to having Barack Obama there. She’s spent the past six years supporting his policies, executing his policies, and she is a voice for the policies of Barack Obama.'

A key attack on Shaheen this election cycle has been her backing of Obama while serving in the Senate. The Democratic lawmaker has voted with the president 99 percent of the time, Brown and the state Republicans have said.

A fact-checking website recently rated Brown's claim as mostly true, noting that over her career, Shaheen has voted for the president's preferred legislation just 98 percent of the time - that number only jumps to 99 percent when looking at recent years.

Republican candidates for office also rallied their supporters on Sunday night.

'There’s 48 hours left. Do not wake up on Nov. 5 wishing you had done more,' Brown said, per WMUR, at a GOP event featuring former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu and New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte.

Though the campaign event did not attract a major surrogate like Clinton, notable Republicans such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a likely 2016 presidential candidate, have come to Brown's aid in recent week, as well.

Polls show that anything could happen in tomorrow's battle between Brown and Shaheen, with NH1 finding Brown up by a single digit in its weekend survey and WMUR claiming Shaheen has the edge. 

Just a month ago Shaheen lead Brown by as much as 10 points. Her lead has since eroded in rapid fashion.

'This race is a complete toss-up,' Wayne Lesperance, a professor of political science at New England College, told NH1.

The WMUR survey may not be as on the nose as NH1's, however, as it was taken over a longer stretch of time and began before the state's final Senate debate. 

Still, Republicans could find themselves on the losing side if the female duo of Hassan and Shaheen are able to fire up women in the state with the help of Clinton. Women favor Shaheen over Brown by nearly seven points, NH1's poll found.

Meanwhile, Brown has a significant lead among men -nine percent.

'This thing is going to go late into the night,' WMUR's pollster Smith predicted.
