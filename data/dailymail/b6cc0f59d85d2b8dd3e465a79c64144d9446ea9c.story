Police in Malaysia have denied that a British backpacker was involved in a fight shortly before he went missing in the jungle, it was reported.

Gareth Huntley's body was found on Wednesday after he disappeared during a trek to a waterfall on Tioman Island, off the south-eastern coast of the country's mainland.

It was discovered in a pond just yards from a kayak storage shed at the Juara Turtle Project where he had been volunteering, adjacent to a row of cabins used by rescue teams during the search.

Police in the country said yesterday 
that they were investigating claims the 34-year-old was involved in a 
fight before he went missing.

It was reported that he may be have been murdered, and there were claims that his throat had been cut.

But a senior police officer on the island has denied the suggestion, local newspaper the Malaysia Star said.

Senior
 Assistant Commissioner Datuk Mohd Zakaria Ahmad said: ‘I was in Pulau 
Tioman on Saturday and I interviewed several witnesses myself. What they
 told me contradicts what the foreign reporter wrote. That report is 
inaccurate.’

He told the newspaper that police were not ruling out foul play, but said the investigation was in its early days.

He said a post-mortem examination had revealed no external injuries.

Earlier,
 the owner of a bistro, Ab Razib Ali Awang, told the Telegraph that most
 people in the local area think something sinister had happened to the 
backpacker.

He said: I’m not sure if the project [people] are making a false report or maybe not telling the police everything.

'There are rumours that there was a fight before with a foreigner.'

He was found on Wednesday near a kayak storage unit near the Juara Turtle Project where the 34-year-old had been working, according to local reports

Mr
 Huntley, of Hackney, east London, who is originally from the 
Leeds-Bradford border, was on a sabbatical from his job in the City.

His family mounted a high-profile campaign to intensify a search for him after he failed to return from his trek.

They spoke of their devastation after it was confirmed that a body found on Wednesday was his.

In
 a statement they said: 'There are no words that can capture the 
devastation we feel right now; no words that can capture the kindness, 
warmth and spirit that Gareth exuded; no words can describe the void he 
will leave in all of the lives he touched.'

His
 mother Janet Southwell, arrived in Malaysia on Monday and was pictured 
on Friday outside the Forensic Unit at the Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital 
in Kuantan with Mr Huntley's girlfriend Kit Natariga.

Mrs Southwell travelled to Malaysia with Miss Natariga to press the authorities into finding him.

She
 broke down in tears and ran to her cabin a short distance away when 
news of the body’s discovery was broken to her by Deputy Police 
Superintendent Johari Yahaya.

Gareth Huntley and his girlfriend Kit Natariga. She said her boyfriend was an experienced backpacker and adventurer who would take utmost care in ensuring he was prepared for excursions

Before
 the positive identification, she had told of how she was staying 
positive in the hope that she would be the ‘friendly face’ her son 
needed when he came out of the jungle.

Search
 teams, made up of commandos, police and Fire and Rescue Department 
specialists accompanied by sniffer dogs had spent days searching the 
jungle for the missing Englishman.

But
 the hunt took a dramatic turn when a search team returned to the 
conservation headquarters where they had spent three nights.

They unexpectedly saw the badly decomposed body floating face up in the Mentawak River.

Dressed in a T-shirt, shorts and shoes, it was just behind a row of cabins being occupied by the rescue teams.

With
 his body being found within the confines of the conservation 
headquarters, police are questioning whether he even managed to reach 
the start of the jungle path before tragedy struck in some way.

They are also looking at the possibility that Mr Huntley did reach the waterfall and plunged into the river on his return.

A
 further line of inquiry will be whether he went into the water further 
upstream and his body was then carried to where it was found.
