Caught: U.S. police arrested a man after he ran into their headquarters (FILE PHOTO)

A man fleeing police ended up inadvertently handing himself in after accidentally running into a police headquarters to hide.

The man, who has not been named, was pulled over while driving in Clayton, St. Louis, Missouri, according to television station KMOV.com.

Authorities said he got out of his car, pushed a police officer away and ran off.

Police chased the man, who was panting heavily and appeared intoxicated, as he ran around the block but were amazed to see him dash straight into the St. Louis County police headquarters.

The suspect had run in to hide, missing a sign outside the building that explained what it was.

Lieutenant Bryan Ludwig, who was sitting in his office, and colleague, officer Randy Vaughn, jumped up to tackle the man as he sprinted towards them.

After a brief chased they blocked him into a corner and arrested him.

Lt Ludwig said: 'You know we joking afterwards because he actually ran towards the jail first and then came back this way.
