The Senate has taken the dramatic step of trying to override the Republican’s ability to outrun the nomination approval process.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid invoked the move, known in Washington as the 'nuclear option,' to end what he considers long-standing abuses of blocking procedures that for more than two centuries have required a 60-vote threshold -- instead of a simple majority vote -- to overcome.

For years, filibusters have been used by those in the minority party to push back the approval of measures that they do not like. Today, Reid put an end to the tactic and President Obama came out in support the move.

Enough is enough: Frustrated with Republicans' repeated use of filibusters to avoid confirming judicial nominees, Democratic Senate majority leader Harry Reid took the 'nuclear option' and got rid of the procedural tool

‘It’s no secret that the American people probably have never been more frustrated with Washington,’ the president said in a press conference this afternoon.

Support: President Obama gave a statement endorsing the Senate's move saying that it will help get more done

He said that since he took office in 2009, there has been an ‘unprecedented pattern of obstruction in Congress’ by politicians who ‘abuse arcane procedural tactics.’

The president said that as a former senator, he values the chamber's powers. But he says some rules are now being used as a tool to 'grind business to a halt.'

Reid, who launched the effort under a parliamentary maneuver scripted in advance, accused Republicans of 'unbelievable, unprecedented obstruction' of Obama's selections to fill court vacancies and other offices.

'It's time to change the Senate, before this institution becomes obsolete,' he said.

His Republican counterpart Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky accused Democrats of 
exercising raw power and said they would regret it when political 
fortunes switched.

He 
likened the effort to the president's since-discredited promise that 
Americans who like their health care can keep it under Obamacare, noting
that Reid promised last summer he wouldn't seek to change the process 
for approving appointees.

'He may as well just have said, "If you like the rules of the Senate, you can keep them,"' McConnell said.

If the filibuster ban is upheld, it could dramatically ease the bottleneck on stalled nominees including federal judges. It would also- and will almost certainly- curtail the influence of the Republicans as they are in the minority of the Senate, which could lead to an escalation of already-frustrating levels of partisanship.

'I think you'll see harder-edged 
partisan choices, and the filter that exists today to kind of weed those
folks out is going to be less,' said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.

Democrats
led by Reid sought to change proceedings so that only a simple majority
was required to clear the way for a final vote.

The Senate vote was 52-48, with three Democrats voting against the rules change. A motion to overturn the change failed.

Republican
were livid about the sudden moves by Reid, who earlier this year made 
similar threats to use the nuclear option but was averted with a 
last-minute compromise.

'This is a power grab,' argued Senator Lamar Alexander.

'It's another partisan political maneuver to permit the Democratic majority to do whatever it wants to do.

'In this case it's to advance the president's regulatory agenda, and the only cure for it that I know is an election.’

Republicans contend that Reid used complex procedural tactics to break Senate rules that require that any changes to those rules be made by a super-majority of two-thirds of senators.

The change is the most far-reaching since 1975, when a two-thirds requirement for cutting off filibusters against legislation and all nominations was lowered to 60 votes.

Though the phrase may suggest the beginning of an international arms race, it has nothing to do with weapons.

The 'nuclear option' is a term that was coined to describe how the majority party would be able to unleash a political explosion of ill-will.

Because switching the rules from requiring 60 votes to a simple majority of just 51 votes, the majority party will be able to pass anything they want.

When the Republicans were the majority party in the Senate, they threatened to pull the proverbial trigger, but cooler heads prevailed.

The maneuvering occurred after a decade in which first one party, then the other, nursed a lengthening list of grievances over delays in confirmation for nominees to the courts.

McConnell noted that Democrats sought to thwart some of President George W. Bush's conservative appointees, while Democrats say the GOP has done the same to Obama's appointees.

In a sign that a showdown was imminent, dozens of senators filed in to listen to Reid and McConnell swap accusations and then cast votes on a complicated series of parliamentary moves.

Even so, there was no doubt about the outcome, if Reid insisted. Democrats control 55 seats, compared with 45 for Republicans.

‘These nominees deserve at least an up-or-down vote. But Republican filibusters deny them a fair vote,’ he said.

To
which McConnell noted that the Senate has confirmed 215 of Obama's 
picks to the courts since he became president, and rejected two. ‘That's
a confirmation rate of 99 percent,’ he said pointedly.

The clash capped a period of increasing irritation on the part of Democrats.

‘They
have decided that their base demands a permanent campaign against the 
president and maximum use of every tool available,’ Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, a leading advocate of revamping filibuster rules, said Wednesday of Republicans.

He said that consideration ‘is trumping the appropriate exercise of advice and consent’ by GOP senators.

The D.C. Circuit Court is viewed as second only to the Supreme Court in power because it rules on disputes over White House and federal agency actions. The circuit's eight judges are divided evenly between Democratic and Republican presidential appointees.

Senior Democrats wary of future GOP retaliation until recently opposed the move, but growing numbers of them have begun lining up behind Reid's effort.

In addition, two dozen groups, including the AFL-CIO and Sierra Club, wrote lawmakers Wednesday supporting the change, saying that ‘rampant, ideology-based obstructionism is the new norm in the U.S. Senate.’

@highlight

Senators regularly stall nominations or votes by using filibusters to 'run out the clock' and stall the process

@highlight

Today the Democratic majority leader effectively banned the tactic

@highlight

The change means that they don't need 60 votes from the 100-person chamber, and now they only need a simple majority of 51 to pass measures

@highlight

Because there are 55 Democrats and 45 Republicans, that means that Democrats could possibly win every vote they put up

@highlight

Called 'going nuclear' because it will unleash a wave of ill-will
