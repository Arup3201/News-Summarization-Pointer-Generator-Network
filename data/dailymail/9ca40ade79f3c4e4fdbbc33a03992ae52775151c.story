Partizan Belgrade midfielder Danilo Pantic has personally confirmed that he is set to sign with Chelsea.

The Premier League leaders beat Juventus to the 18-year-old's signature, after the Italian side made approaches to sign the Serbia Under 19 international.

Pantic will be joining the west London club for £1.25m and revealed he will go to Vitesse Arnhem on loan for the rest of the season.

The 18-year-old Pantic had also attracted interest from Italian Serie A giants Juventus

'As an 18-year-old it is hard to get a chance at Chelsea and I was immediately excited by the opportunity to play first in the Netherlands. That competition is ideal for young talent and they play attacking football,' said Pantic.

'I already know a lot about Vitesse. It's a big club where many young players play and games will be played offensively.

'If I play well at Vitesse, then I will probably go back to Chelsea.'
