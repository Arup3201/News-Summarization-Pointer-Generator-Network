West Bromwich Albion will honour club legend Jeff Astle by wearing a retro kit in their Premier League match with Leicester City on April 11.

To mark the launch of the Jeff Astle Foundation, the Baggies will don a replica of the white kit worn in the 1968 FA Cup final win over Everton at Wembley.

Astle scored the winner that day, his most famous Albion moment, and he will be remembered and honoured on 'Astle Day' at The Hawthorns for the Leicester game.

The white kit, which doesn't feature any sponsorship, will be worn on 'Jeff Astle day' when a new foundation will be launched in his name to raise funds for research into CTE, the condition that caused his death

Jeff Astle was a prolific centre forward who scored 174 goals in 361 matches for West Bromwich Albion in a decade-long spell at The Hawthorns between 1964 and 1974.

Known as 'The King' by supporters of the club, Astle's crowning glory came when he scored the extra time winner in the 1968 FA Cup final against Everton at Wembley.

Two years later, Astle scored in Albion's 2-1 defeat to Manchester City in the League Cup final, becoming the first player to score in finals of both English cup competitions at Wembley.

Astle won five caps for England and was part of the squad at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico.

He passed away on January 19, 2002 at the age of 59, with a coroner finding that repeated minor traumas caused by heading the heavy leather footballs of his era were the cause of his death.

Baggies fans applaud in the ninth minute of every game - No 9 was his shirt number - in tribute to him.

His family will officially launch the Foundation, which will raise funds for research into CTE or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Astle died of the condition in 2002 at the age of just 59.

The disease is normally linked to boxing but coroners at the footballer's inquest ruled Astle's brain had been damaged by heading heavy leather footballs in the 1960s and 1970s.

The Justice for Jeff campaign was launched after this and at every game this season, Baggies fans have held a minute-long round of applause in the ninth minute as he wore the No 9 shirt for the club.

The historic kit, modelled by club captain Darren Fletcher and striker Saido Berahino, features no sponsorship logos and the players will be numbered 1-11 as was tradition at the time.

It is only the second time the Premier League have given special dispensation for a replica strip to be worn - the other was for Manchester United on the 50th anniversary of the Munich Air Disaster in 2008.

Jeff's widow Laraine and daughters Dawn and Claire chose the Leicester fixture because they provided the opposition on Astle's debut for the Baggies 50 years ago.

Club chairman Jeremy Peace said: 'We promised at the start of the season to honour both Jeff and his family's efforts to raise awareness of an important issue by dedicating a home game to him - and it promises to be a special day.

'We are absolutely delighted the Premier League have granted permission for this kit change as an additional salute to a footballer who remains much loved.

'We are mindful that it is only the second time this has happened which I think says much about Jeff's standing and the gravity football places on the issues his death raised.

'We must not forget to also thank our sponsors Intuit QuickBooks and kit suppliers Adidas. When we presented them with the idea they immediately grasped the spirit of the project and graciously stepped aside.

'The one minute ovations for Jeff and the 'if in doubt, sit it out' campaign this season have been well supported by fans up and down the country and now the launch of the Foundation gives a new impetus to the family's efforts.

'There is a need to support the research required to understand more about the issues the Astle family have fought so hard to raise.

'I hope that on April 11, Jeff's old club will be seen to be honouring a promise and helping them. He would have wanted that.'

FA chairman Greg Dyke, who has met with the family to discuss their campaign, said: 'I am delighted to see West Bromwich Albion dedicate this day to their great hero, Jeff Astle. 

'I know a few West Brom fans and I know how much Jeff meant to them and with how much regard they still hold him – you only need to see the reaction to the Justice for Jeff campaign to understand that.

'I think the Astle family's dedication to their father and husband is inspiring and the idea of an Astle Foundation is important. 

'I know we at The FA are now progressing positively with an expert panel to look at head injuries and we remain committed to ensuring the notion of research in this important area of sports medicine is taken to the highest levels at UEFA and FIFA.'
