A rescuer who searched for the three British climbers caught up in last week’s avalanche in the French Alps told yesterday of the desperate race to save them – and the terrible moment he realised they were dead.

French guide Yann Delevaux, 33, and his colleagues were using 10ft steel probes to search the mountain near Chamonix when he felt something lodged under the snow.

‘I touched something with the probe,’ he said. ‘I shouted that I had found something and then the digging began.  We got shovels, big shovels. The snow is heavy.

Rescue bid: Guide Yann Delevaux led attempts to find the buried mountaineers

‘The first thing we saw was a badge – 
we knew then that we had found a mountain guide. You wish they are going
to move but you know really that there’s no chance.

‘We
saw that he was roped to someone. We dug and dug and followed the rope 
and found the second body. We saw the rope continued. We then found a 
third body.

‘It’s a clash of emotions. You are happy that you have found them but they are dead. That’s terrible.’

Mr
Delevaux and his colleagues had discovered guide Roger Payne, Steve 
Barber and John Taylor. Mr Payne, 55 – one of the UK’s most respected 
climbers – is a former general secretary of the British Mountaineering 
Council. Close friends Mr Barber, 47, and Mr Taylor, 48, lived in the 
same street in North Yorkshire.

The
three were swept to their deaths along with three Germans, two 
Spaniards and one Swiss by a thunderous 60ft wall of snow and ice just 
after 5am on Thursday.

They 
were in a party of 28 climbers on Mont Maudit – which means Cursed Peak –
and were on their way to the summit of Mont Blanc when the avalanche 
struck. Mr Delevaux said he was contacted at 9am by mountain police who 
had been searching for climbers since they received an emergency call 
from a dazed and injured French guide three-and-a-half hours earlier.

Mr Delevaux sent a text message summoning dozens of volunteers before flying to the site of the accident by helicopter.

Killed: Steve Barber, left, and John Taylor, who both died in the avalanche, were lifelong best friends who lived on the same street in Upper Poppleton, Yorkshire

He
said: ‘An area of about 100 yards square needed to be probed. About 40 
of us were standing at the bottom of the avalanche debris 
shoulder-to-shoulder in a long line, and we started pushing the probes 
into the snow.

‘Then you 
take one step forward and do the same thing. The entire area needed to 
be probed because we didn’t know what we were dealing with.

‘You
have no sense of time out there.  I later learned that we had been out 
there for two hours when we struck something under the snow. The bodies 
were about 3ft below the surface.’

He added: ‘You have such a range of emotions. They are someone’s loved one, and as a guide you realise it could have been you.’

Yesterday,
a memorial service was held for the victims at the 12th Century church 
of St Michael in Chamonix, which stands at the foot of Mont Blanc.

Prayers
will also be offered today for Mr Barber, Mr Taylor and their families 
at All Saints Church in their home village of Upper Poppleton, near 
York.
