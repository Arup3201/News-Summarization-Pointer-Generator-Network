Former glamour model Peta Todd was left disappointed but unhurt after crashing on the first competitive day of the 2014 World Rally Championship season finale in Wales.

Todd, married to Tour de France superstar Mark Cavendish, teamed up with Tony Jardine, the Sky Sports F1 pundit, to take part in the Wales Rally GB.

However, after coming through the opening stages in treacherous conditions the Help for Heroes patron's Mitsubishi Evo IX collided with a log pile on the inside of a right corner, collapsing the front right wheel and effectively ending the Prospeed team's race.

Fortunately, neither Todd or Jardine were injured in the incident. The car suffered major damage to the front right corner as well as a smashed front windscreen, and after the fans helped to move the car to safety from the middle of the track, they were towed off the stage.

Jardine stressed that the accident was not his partner's fault but had come from his own error.

'It was totally my fault. The stage was drying out and I was trying to go quicker. I took a downhill corner in fifth gear and lost the back of the car. As a result we swung into the logs, which cut into the front of the chassis. But the main thing of course is that Peta and I were unharmed, and the marshals did a fantastic job of getting us and the car to safety.

'It won't be easy, but hopefully the ProSpeed guys can get us back out on stage tomorrow.'

The car's problems were not diagnosed as terminal, meaning a race against time to replace and rebuild the front end before it can be re-entered tomorrow. 

Todd was clearly very disappointed after the crash, although she is hopeful that she can get back in contention.

'We're both gutted but the most important thing is that neither of us is injured. Tony took the corner a little tight and clipped a log pile which flung the back end out but he did amazingly well to control the car and prevent us from going in to a huge ditch the other side. 

'The damage meant that Tony couldn't open his door and had to climb out of my side. Initially I must admit I thought that was the end of our entire rally, but thankfully the team are hard at work and positive that we will be competing tomorrow.

'We were both a bit shaken up, but if the car's fixed I want to go out again tomorrow.'
