All expenses paid: Prince Andrew has been on more trips than last year since quitting as a UK trade envoy

Prince Andrew has been on more taxpayer-funded overseas trips this year despite stepping down from his trade role over links to a convicted paedophile.

The Duke of York gave up his role as a trade envoy for Britain when disturbing details emerged of his close friendship with Jeffery Epstein.

But since then Andrew has spent more nights abroad and clocked up considerably more miles than in the same period last year.

The trips have included stays in a string of luxury hotels and the use of a private jet at a cost of about £40,000 for a trip to Saudi Arabia.  

Campaigners branded the Duke's overseas travels 'shocking' and called on him to reign in the expenses.

Prince Andrew had been expected to cut back on expenses-paid trips when he left his role as Special Representative for UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) in July this year.

But he has since spent 28 days abroad, visiting Saudi Arabia, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. He covered more than 40,800 miles.

In the same period last year he spent 22 nights abroad, flying about 29,500 miles, according to the Telegraph.

The total cost to the taxpayer could exceed the figure from last year, which came in at £358,763. He does not have a paid position for the costs are met by taxpayers.

Also included in Adrew's trips were luxurious hotel suites, advertised at up to £7,700 a night, during a 12-day tour of Hong Kong, China and Malaysia.

They included the Mandarin Oriental in 
Hong Kong, which claims to offer the ‘finest in 21st Century luxury’ and
its sister hotel in Kuala Lumpur, which boasts custom-carved door 
handles and ‘sumptuous’ beds.

John O’Connell, the research director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said the most recent figures raised questions about the Duke's 'value for money'.

'Taxpayers will wonder why they are paying even more for Prince Andrew’s jet-set lifestyle now that he has quit as trade commissioner,' he told the Telegraph.

'Many wondered whether the Prince was 
providing value for money before he quit, it’s shocking that he’s 
costing even more now despite not having a formal role in representing 
the country on trade issues.

'It’s time the Prince drastically cut back on his foreign jaunts at taxpayers’ expense.'

The fourth-in-line to the throne, nicknamed Air Miles Andy for his reputation for foreign trips, faced
pressure earlier this year after being caught up in revelations about 
Epstein, a billionaire financier.

Epstein faced a lawsuit being brought by alleged child sex victims. The abuse was said to have taken place at his mansions, including one in Palm Beach, Florida, that Andrew had visited.

The Duke faced the prospect of being called as a witness in any future trials to explain his relationship to the billionaire and his knowledge of such activities.

Two months before the revelations, Epstein and Andrew were photographed in conversation while walking in New York’s Central Park, while the Duke was a guest of the tycoon.

Epstein had earlier been jailed for two years after he was jailed for soliciting prostitution from minors. He served 13 months.

That was bad enough but even Andrew's most loyal supporters were left floundering when a photograph emerged in late February of the smiling duke with his arm around 17-year-old Virginia Roberts, an 'erotic masseuse' who was sexually abused by Epstein.

She was one of dozens of teenage girls allegedly abused by Epstein.

A spokesman for UKTI said: 'When the Duke stood down as Special Representative for Trade and Investment it was always the intention that he would continue to work with the Government to promote British trade and investment overseas, and the recent trips are evidence of that.'

Buckingham Palace said the trips had been arranged before the Prince had stepped down.
