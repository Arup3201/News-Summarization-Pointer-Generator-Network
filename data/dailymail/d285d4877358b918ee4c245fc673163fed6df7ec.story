This terraced family home is believed to be the cheapest in the UK - and it could be sold for as little as 10p.

The three-bedroom house in Port Clarence, Teesside, has a guide price of just £750, and yet is ready to move in to straight away with a working bathroom and kitchen.

As it has no reserve price, the property in Limetrees Close could go for no more than a few pence when it is auctioned off tonight.

Neighbourhood: The house is in Port Clarence, Teesside, a post-industrial town near Middlesborough

A number of other homes have previously been dubbed Britain's cheapest, but most have not actually been inhabitable without a total renovation.

However, while the buyer of this house can move in immediately, he or she will have to do a certain amount of work - the windows have been boarded up and the garden is totally overgrown.

Experts say that after renovation the property, situated in a deprived area of the port town, could be worth more than £25,000.

The home consists of an entrance hall, three bedrooms, family bathroom and a large lounge.

Decent shape: The home could do with a lick of paint, but is hardly looking delapidated

Kitchen: It may be missing some utilities, but there are the facilities to cook up a simple family meal

Sparse: The new owner will have some work to do to stamp his or her personality on the property

'This is a total bargain,' said Jordan Smith of auctioneer iam-sold. 'I am not aware of any properties in the UK that have a lower guide price than this.

'As it has no reserve, technically the house could sell for as little as a few pounds.

'It doesn't even need much work, I have been told that a few thousand would be sufficient to get it up to scratch.

Bathroom: The washing facilities certainly belie the £750 guide price for the terraced home

Well-lit: But it remains to be seen how popular the property will prove at auction

Bargain? Although the property certainly needs a lot of work, it is inhabitable straight away

'The owner is keen for a quick sale but we are hoping that when it goes under the hammer, bidders will bring in a decent price.

'Potentially it could make a nice family home. It's not the best area, but we have had interest from people hoping to move in straight away, those who would like to rent it out, and some who hope to renovate it and make a profit.'

Last October, two other Port Clarence homes sold for a combined total of less than £25,000.

Both three-bedroom properties were located on Limetrees Close, and went for £14,000 and £10,500.

Cheap move: The one-bedroom flat in Hartlepool, County Durham with an auction price of just £2,500

A two-bedroom home in Burnley, 
Lancashire was labelled the cheapest house in Britain in April, on sale 
with a starting price of just £1,000.

The
 property was so dilapidated that it would have taken thousands of 
pounds to make it liveable. Estate agents marketing the house admitted 
the home was 'in need of complete refurbishment'.

Another of Britain's cheapest homes went to auction in February with a starting price of just £2,500 (right).

Estate
 agents admitted the one-bedroom flat in Hartlepool, County Durham, was 
in a 'distressed' state, but said the first-floor apartment could make 
an ideal first home with lots of DIY.

And
 a three-bedroom house that went on sale in Middlesbrough was given a 
starting price of just £750 when it went under the hammer last October.

The
 semi-detached home featured a lounge, entrance hall, family bathroom 
and a front and rear garden. Although situated in a troubled area of the
 town, it was described as an ‘ideal investment’.

Earlier this week, an even cheaper house appeared on the market - auctioneers listed a home in the old mining village on Nantymoel, South Wales for free.

However, that property hardly counts as a home - the sellers admitted it was 'unfit for human habitation' and described it as 'little more than a shell requiring complete renovation'.
