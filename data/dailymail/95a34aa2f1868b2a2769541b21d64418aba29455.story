Disgusting: Seattle's Jeffrey Johannes Evenson, a Level III sex offender, was arrested yesterday for allegedly repeatedly raping a six-year-old girl with her mother's consent

A 42-year-old man twice convicted of sexually
assaulting children has been accused of repeatedly raping a six-year-old girl with her mother's consent.

Seattle's Jeffrey Johannes Evenson, a Level III sex offender, was arrested yesterday after the girl, now aged nine, told a family friend she was sexually abused for at least two years.

Police allege the unidentified girl's now-dead mother allowed Evenson, who she lived with from 2008 to 2010, to fondle her young daughter.

Evenson was released from prison on child rape charges just two years before he and the girl's mother moved in together.

He was under Community Supervision until January 2008.

Kiro 7 reported the girl's father recently notified police about his daughter's claims.

Investigators claim the girl's mother forced her to watch pornographic movies and be in bed with 
her and Evenson when they had sex.

The police report also said she allowed her child rapist partner to molest her child. The woman is now dead.

Evenson was booked into the King County Jail with bail set at $500,000.

Kiro 7 reported Evenson could have a life sentence because of the U.S. state of Washington's 'two strikes you're out' law for sex convictions.

Evenson was convicted in 1990 of child rape and was in prison until 1994.

Just four years later, he was convicted of child molestation, and was behind bars until March 2006.

Evenson was also convicted twice for failing to register as a sex offender.

Prosecutors today noted in court that Evenson was previously investigated – but not charged – in two other sexual assaults.

Seattle Pi reported Evenson was a homeless sex offender known to frequent Virginia Avenue in downtown Seattle prior to his arrest.

Washington State Department of Corrections spokeswoman Norah West said Evenson was not predatory enough to be sent to the Civil Commitment Center for Sexually Violent Predators on McNeil Island.

'In 2005, Evenson was deemed ineligible for civil commitment because his forensic psychological exam results indicated he did not meet the criteria of a sexually violent predator,' she said.
