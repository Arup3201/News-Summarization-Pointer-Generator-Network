A Canada woman was roused from her bed Thursday morning by a deep, rumbling sound emanating from the skies all around her British Columbia home and managed to catch the spooky experience on video.

Kimberly Wookey of Terrace, British Columbia was deeply rattled by the groaning she says she’s heard before but the origins of which remain a mystery.

And not just to her. People all over the world have reported similar sounds, including a 2012 instance that was heard by people across continents, but no one can yet answer who or what is making the creepy sounds.

Captivating: Kimberly Wookey's video of a mysterious rumbling from the sky has captivated her small Canada town and viewers across the web

Wookey says in her YouTube comments that she’s heard the sound before but was only this time able to record it.

‘First time was back in June,’ writes Wookey. ‘But it was not quite as intense.’

This time Wookey was ready.

‘I shot out of bed like a bat out of hell,’ she writes.

Like a horror flick: The surroundings are like a horror film when paired with the eery sound that other witnesses said seemed to be coming from the ground as much as from the sky

Wookey’s 7-year-old son was also woken up by the droning sound, which echoed off the mountains that surround Terrace for several minutes.

And the Wookey’s weren’t the only people to hear it. People all over Terrace told have recounted the strange experience.

Mandi Campbell also heard the sounds.

‘It seemed to be coming from the sky or underground, something so loud though,’ she told CBC News.

Debbie Vantikrus heard it, too.

Many others like Wookey witnessed the sound. And similar phenomena have occurred worldwide, most notably a 2012 instance where sounds were heard in the sky worldwide

‘I heard this noise, and at first I thought I might have left a window open and the wind was howling,’ she said. ‘The more I listened to it I thought … no, that’s not wind howling through a window, it must be somebody tuning up some instrument in George Little Park. So, I just dismissed it from my head and thought that’s what it was.’

Then Vantikus arrived to work and heard others describe the spooky sound.

Despite all the talk, local authorities and even Canadian science officials still can’t say for sure what happened. Though, that hasn’t stopped them from trying.

Something known as ‘the hum’ also has science and those who hear it perplexed.

It is a noise that only two per cent of people can hear, but this low droning sound would be enough to drive anyone mad.

Sufferers have been able to identify common factors: the humming is only heard indoors, it is a low, rumbling noise, it is louder at night, and is more common in more rural areas.

In the UK, the noise has been heard in Leeds, Bristol, and Largs, Scotland, but has been reported as far as Taos, New Mexico, and Bondi Beach in Sydney.

A 2003 study by acoustical consultant Geoff Leventhall, from Surrey, shows that one in 50 people who live in a Hum-prone place hear the noise, and that most of these people are aged between 55 and 70.

Katie Jacques, from Leeds, told the BBC: ‘It's a kind of torture; sometimes, you just want to scream.

‘It's hard to get off to sleep because I hear this throbbing sound in the background.  You're tossing and turning, and you get more and more agitated about it.’

Those who hear it can experience headaches, nausea, dizziness, nosebleeds and sleep disturbances, and the BBC reported at least one suicide as a result of the noise. 

However, like the sky groaning, the exact cause of the hum remains a mystery.

University of Northern British Columbia Physics Professor Erik Jensen heard the sounds and told CFNR they were unlike anything he’d seen before but had this to say:

‘First, sounds can travel very large distances when he conditions are right, and travel in surprising directions- sound can refract in the atmosphere and “bounce” along if the conditions are right. Sounds can also be focused so will vary a lot from place to place.’

There is precedent over the last few years for such a mystery.

In January 2012, similar sounds were reported all across Canada, in Chicago, New York, and even across the Atlantic in Norway and Spain.

A search of YouTube will find a trove of such instances caught on video, some of them more credible than others.

An Edmonton woman whose posted her video of the 2012 occurrence later admitted it was a fake.

And even Wookey’s video has been dismissed as just a rip-off of a scene from 2011 horror flick Red State.
