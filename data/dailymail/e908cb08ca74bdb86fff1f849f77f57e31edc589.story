Capt Jody Suit of the Del City Police Department told NewsOK.com that the boy's death was 'believed to be from child abuse.'

Jaidyn had been in the custody of his grandmother, but she was working at the time - and Respicio was watching him along with her 15-year-old boyfriend.

During questioning, Respicio admitted that she was behind the boy's death.

Lt Brian Wofford with the Del City Police Department told KOTV: 'The mother did confess that she caused the injury.'

At this point, cops do not believe that the boyfriend, who has not been identified, was involved in the child's death.
