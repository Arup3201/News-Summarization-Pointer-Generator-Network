British war planes will  begin air strikes on Iraq today amid a spiralling political row over whether they should also hit Islamic State fanatics in neighbouring Syria.

Six RAF Tornados are expected to join US, French and Arab air strikes – their first in Iraq for six years – after MPs voted overwhelmingly to go into a third Gulf War.

Warning that the fight to crush IS could last for years, not months, David Cameron told an emergency session of Parliament that as well as murdering Western hostages with ‘staggering brutality’ the group was plotting terrorist attacks in Britain.

Prime Minister David Cameron warned IS has behaved with 'staggering brutality' as he opened the debate ahead of the vote in Parliament

Six RAF Tornados are expected to join US, French and Arab air strikes – their first in Iraq for six years 

‘This is about psychopathic terrorists trying to kill us,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘We do have to realise that whether we like it or not, they have already declared war on us.’

MPs authorised military action by 524 votes to 43, one of the biggest Commons majorities since the last general election. 

But last night Labour education spokesman Rushanara Ali resigned, saying she could not support air strikes. And defence spokesman Vernon Coaker was forced to sack aide Iain McKenzie for voting against strikes in Iraq.

Mr Cameron said that there was a ‘strong case’ for extending air strikes against IS, also known as Isil or Isis, from Iraq into Syria, where it has also seized vast areas. 

Cameron leaving Parliament after MPs backed the Government motion authorising military action against IS

IS now controls territory the size of the UK. ‘I am very clear: Isil needs to be destroyed in Syria as well as Iraq,’ he said. ‘We support the action that the US and five Arab states have taken in Syria.’

The Prime Minister even suggested he might be prepared to intervene in Syria without seeking a vote in Parliament if it would avert a ‘humanitarian catastrophe’ or there was an immediate threat to Britain.

But he ruled out deploying British combat troops – though special forces are already operating in the region, and troops may be deployed to train regional forces acting on the ground.

Although Labour leader Ed Miliband backed action in Iraq, he prompted a backlash from both Conservative and Labour MPs by saying Britain would have to seek a United Nations resolution authorising any attacks on Syria.

This is the text of the motion passed by MPs after a six-hour debate:

'That this House condemns the barbaric acts of ISIL against the peoples of Iraq including the Sunni, Shia, Kurds, Christians and Yazidi and the humanitarian crisis this is causing;

'Recognises the clear threat ISIL poses to the territorial integrity of Iraq and the request from the Government of Iraq for military support from the international community and the specific request to the UK Government for such support;

'Further recognises the threat ISIL poses to wider international security and the UK directly through its sponsorship of terrorist attacks and its murder of a British hostage;

'Acknowledges the broad coalition contributing to military support of the Government of Iraq including countries throughout the Middle East;

'Further acknowledges the request of the Government of Iraq for international support to defend itself against the threat ISIL poses to Iraq and its citizens and the clear legal basis that this provides for action in Iraq;

'Notes that this motion does not endorse UK air strikes in Syria as part of this campaign and any proposal to do so would be subject to a separate vote in Parliament;

'Accordingly supports Her Majesty's Government, working with allies, in supporting the Government of Iraq in protecting civilians and restoring its territorial integrity, including the use of UK air strikes to support Iraqi, including Kurdish, security forces' efforts against ISIL in Iraq;

'Notes that Her Majesty's Government will not deploy UK troops in ground combat operations;

'And offers its wholehearted support to the men and women of Her Majesty's armed forces.' 

This effectively blocks the Government from taking action because Russia has already pledged to veto any such resolution.

‘In my view, when we are not talking about being invited in by a democratic state it would be better – I put it no higher than that – it would be better to seek a UN Security Council resolution,’ he told the Commons.

However, his stance was criticised by some senior Labour figures because it effectively leaves the decision in the hands of Russia. 

Former minister Pat McFadden said: ‘Why is it right to come to the aid of the victims of Isis who are living under a democracy in Iraq but not those who are living under a dictatorship in Syria?’

Backing military action, Labour leader Ed Miliband said 'although this is difficult, it's the right thing to do'

Former Labour defence secretary Lord Hutton said: ‘My concern has been that we’ve almost closed down any sort of action in Syria, we’ve closed down any discussion about support troops on the ground and I would much prefer those options to be kept open.’

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon suggested the Government might ask MPs to support extending air strikes into Syria.

‘Isil is based in Syria, that’s where its headquarters are, that’s where its resources, its people are,’ he said. ‘To deal with Isil you do have to deal and defeat them in both Iraq and in Syria.’

Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander later said that Labour would not insist on a UN resolution before considering action in Syria.

Justin Welby gave his backing to air strikes in Iraq, telling the House of Lords that the 'perverted’ ideology of IS was just one part of a global problem

The Archbiship of Canterbury gave his backing to air strikes in Iraq, but issued a pointed warning to religious leaders to ‘up their game’ against the threat of radical Islam.

Justin Welby told the House of Lords that the ‘twisted and perverted’ ideology of IS was just one part of a global problem.

He said there was justification for armed force in the short-term to help victims of their ‘dreadful brutality’. But military action could not solve what is a ‘global, ideological, religious and trans-generational challenge’ which threatens to plunge the world into ‘endless darkness’.

‘Religious leaders must up their game,’ he said, ‘and the church is playing its part... The action proposed today is right, but we must not rely on a short-term solution.

‘We must demonstrate that there is a positive vision far greater and more compelling than the evil of IS and its global clones.’

The debate in the Lords, in which dozens of peers spoke, saw a majority in favour of air strikes.

Baroness Stowell, for the Government, said that destroying the ‘evil extremism’ of IS in Iraq would be in the interests of Britain’s national security.

But former Tory minister Michael Ancram, the Marquess of Lothian, said that ‘we should hold our fire’.

He said: ‘Our mind is not closed and we have not made a UN Security Council resolution a condition of future action… Our moral compass is not set in Moscow or Beijing… we have said very clearly that there is a legal basis for action.’

Opening an often impassioned six-and-a-half hour debate, Mr Cameron warned that IS posed a direct threat to Britain that could not be ignored.

‘This is not a threat on the far side of the world,’ he said. ‘Left unchecked, we will face a terrorist caliphate on the shores of the Mediterranean, bordering a Nato member, with a declared and proven determination to attack our country and our people.’

Mr Cameron said the war against Isil would take ‘not just months, but years’, adding: ‘The hallmarks of this campaign will be patience and persistence, not shock and awe.’

Outside Parliament, protesters held placards which read 'Don't Bomb Iraq' but inside the Commons MPs insisted the situation was different to the 2003 invasion of Iraq ordered by Tony Blair

Some relatives of kidnapped British taxi driver Alan Henning, the latest hostage threatened with beheading by IS, have warned that air strikes could reduce their chances of ever seeing him again.

But Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond insisted the attacks would make little difference to the fate of Westerners held by IS.

÷Firebrand Muslim preacher Anjem Choudary and seven other men were released on bail last night after being questioned by counter terrorism detectives.

Choudary, 47, and ten other members of his inner circle were arrested in London and Rugby, Warwickshire, on suspicion of supporting banned extremist group al-Muhajiroun, which he co-founded almost 20 years ago.

His friend, Trevor Brooks, 39, now known as Abu Izzadeen, was charged with breaching a counter terrorism order by giving police false information. He will appear before magistrates today.
