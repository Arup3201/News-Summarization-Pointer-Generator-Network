Luis Suarez has always dreamed of playing for Barcelona, claims his former Ajax team-mate Gabri.

He says he is still great friends with the Uruguayan and believes Suarez would be able to handle the pressure of playing for a club like Barcelona.

Gabri, a player at the Nou Camp himself for seven years before joining Ajax in 2006, spoke about Suarez's maturity and character.

'Luis Suarez has always wanted to play for the club and defend the Barcelona shirt,' he told Spanish television station Esport.

'He has always wanted to head here someday, so I would be very pleased [if he did].

'I also believe the club want to buy him. He would suit it well, he is very enthusiastic and would fit in nicely at the club.

'The family of his wife are also in Barcelona.'

Suarez's in-laws reside in Castelldefels and that could play a key role in the striker's decision to choose Barcelona over Real Madrid, who are also chasing him.

Gabri continued: 'He has footballing maturity and is a player with character and personality.

'He would be able to handle the pressure of playing at a club like this.

'Suarez is a goalscorer. His position is as a No 9 but sometimes he can play wider.

'He's quick, he's a very complete player and in great form.'

Gabri also said that his wife was close to Suarez's and they became good friends at Ajax as they spoke the same language.

The Spanish press claimed on Monday that the striker wants to leave Liverpool and has his heart set on Barcelona.

It will be a costly transfer operation and the Blaugrana are hoping to lessen the cost by including Alexis Sanchez in a prospective deal.

The Chile forward plays in the right-hand slot in Barcelona's front line that they want Suarez to occupy, with Lionel Messi in the middle and Neymar on the left.
