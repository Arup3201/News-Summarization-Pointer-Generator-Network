A group of primary school kids on an excursion were caught in the middle of a mid-air scare onboard a Qantas plane from Canberra to Perth.

The children were seated at the back of the plane causing the nose's weight to be higher due to the brunt of the weight being held in the front.

Although pilots managed to rectify the situation and take off a report was released by the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau.

Quantas check in staff have introduced a new check in procedure after the the mid-flight scare in a Canberra to Perth flight

The school group were seated with their chaperones at the back of the plane and assigned adult standard seated which should hold a standard 87kg adult.

The children were all over the age of 11 which is above the age child seats are assigned.

There was quite a serious discrepancy of 55kg per seat each child was was assigned to while majority of the adult passengers were given seats at the front of plane.

The aircraft appeared nose-heavy during take-off, forcing the captain to apply significant back pressure to achieve lift off from the runway.

Off the mark: The final load sheet of the Canberra to Perth flight overstated the aircraft take-off weight by about 3.5 to five tonnes

'Qantas has worked with the ATSB to investigate a weight and balance anomaly on a Canberra to Perth flight,' a Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.

'The investigation found that due to an administrative error, the weight of some passengers was incorrectly recorded as adults rather than children.'

'This meant that the aircraft didnâ€™t have the optimum configuration for takeoff, but at no stage was this a material risk to passenger safety.'

An investigation by the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau was led after the incident, which found  87 primary school children on were assigned the adult weight of 87kg

Too much back pressure could have caused the aircraft tail to strike the runway, but the captain managed to ease the aircraft into the air.

The incident, prompted an investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.

It was subsequently determined that the final load sheet overstated the aircraft take-off weight by about 3.5 to five tonnes.

The Australian Transport and Safety Bureau said Qantas issued a new procedure to check-in staff, reminding them to ensure that children travelling on group bookings must be recorded as children, to ensure aircraft weight and balance is based on an accurate passenger type.

The new procedure ensures that children travelling on group bookings must be recorded as children, which will ensure an accurate passenger weight assessment
