Analysts argue that, manic depression was behind the performances in many of Robin Wiilliams' movies

Madcap antics may be part of a comedian’s on-stage persona.

But the madness may not be just an act, say researchers.

The ability to make people laugh comes from a personality of the kind displayed by those with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

Historically, the creativity of painters and playwrights has been linked to madness, but now British experts have found a link with comedians.

High levels of psychotic personality traits are behind the ‘sad clown’ façade of comedians like Spike Milligan, who suffered manic-depressive episodes all his life.

Researchers from Oxford University and Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust say manic thinking helps join together ridiculous ideas that spark humour.

The stand-ups of a modern era are likely to have greater levels of extraversion – a form of impulsiveness – yet be more depressive and unsociable at the same time.

Insane: Spike Milligan suffered years of paralysing manic depression. One of his psychiatrists judged him to be 'certifiably insane' and 'a possible danger to others'

In fact, say the researchers, making people laugh may be a form of self-medication to alleviate a low mood.

Analysts say Robin Williams suffered from bipolar disorder though they cannot support it with enough evidence.

They argue that, manic depression was behind the performances in many of his movies. Williams will throw away the script and act out his heart. He was almost always the comedian in the movies, making fun of serious life issues.

One writer suggested that Robin suffered depression when he broke up with one of his former girlfriends and that, it affected his stage performances. Another suggested Williams was depressed when he was dropped from Julliard.

Professor Gordon Claridge, of the 
University of Oxford, who led the study, said: ‘Although schizophrenic 
psychosis itself can be detrimental to humour, in its lesser form it can
 increase people’s ability to associate odd or unusual things or to 
think ‘outside the box’.

‘Equally, manic thinking, which is 
common in people with bipolar disorder, may help people combine ideas to
 form new, original and humorous connections.’

Prof
 Claridge, with colleagues Victoria Ando and Ken Clark, persuaded 523 
comedians – 404 men and 119 women – to take part in their study.

A number of American comedians are able to harness whatever their mental state maybe be in order to create comedy gold.

They were asked to complete a 
questionnaire designed to measure certain traits, such as: belief in 
telepathy and paranormal events; how easily distracted they are; their 
ability to feel social and physical pleasure; and their tendency towards
 impulsive behaviour.

The 
questionnaire was also completed by 364 actors – another profession used
 to performing – and to a general group of 831 people who had 
non-creative occupations.

Comedians scored significantly higher on all four types of psychotic personality traits compared with the general group.

Most striking was their high scores for both extraverted, manic-like responses and socially introverted moodiness, says a report in the British Journal of Psychiatry.
