Sergio Ramos wants players to show the same commitment for Spain as they do for their clubs.

The Spanish defender is preparing for the qualifier with Belarus on Saturday and admits he was surprised to see Chelsea’s Diego Costa left out of the squad through injury before playing for Chelsea against Liverpool.

But Ramos says the decision must be left with manager Vicente del Bosque.

Speaking to MARCA radio, Ramos said: ‘It can create some doubt. Not only among teammates, but among the supporters. Issues like these spark debate. 

'I wouldn’t have allowed that because I would have gone out to talk about it and clarify the issue a bit so that it didn’t get blown out of proportion and so that people knew the problem. It’s better to set the record straight so that people can’t speculate and make it up.

‘It’s difficult to set rules, there always needs to be an element of tact on matters like these. I think it’s better as long as it doesn’t give a false impression to the fans and your teammates.

‘I’d like to see all players having the same commitment with the selection as they have with their clubs.

Ramos says manager Vicente del Bosque has to be left to make the decisions 

‘I think we have to transmit this commitment to all the new players who come for the first time. At the end of the day that’s what makes the difference, it’s what makes success whether your club pays you or your national team.’

Spain are currently second in their qualification group, three points behind leaders Slovakia and are level on points with Ukraine.
