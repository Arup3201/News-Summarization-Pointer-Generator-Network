Dwight Moorer, a Selma police officer, shot his ex-girlfriend and her stepfather before shooting himself

An off-duty police officer shot dead his ex-girlfriend and her stepfather before turning the gun on himself.

The body of Dwight Moorer was found with his former girlfriend's body in a parked car outside a house in Selma, Alabama, police confirmed yesterday.

Her stepfather's body was found with gunshot wounds to his body in a car outside a nearby house in the Dallas County town.

Moorer, who had been a Selma officer for five years, was an Army veteran who served on two tours of Iraq.

Selma Chief of Police William T. Riley said the gun used by Moorer was not his police weapon.

'This hurts us so deeply, Riley told the Selma Times-Journal.

'Itâ€™s bad enough to see the loss of 
life, but to know that one of our officers, one of our own, would go out
and do something like this is devastating.'

Moorer's police colleagues found his body in a car alongside his ex-girlfriend at a house in Selma, Dallas County

'This is a terrible and tragic situation,' Riley said.

'All of our hearts go out to the victims and the families involved.'

The names of the victims will not be released until their families have been notified.
