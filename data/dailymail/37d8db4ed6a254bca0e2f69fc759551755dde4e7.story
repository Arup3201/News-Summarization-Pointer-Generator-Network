Human rights judges yesterday saved British taxpayers from a multi-million pound compensation bill in a ruling on prisoner voting.

The European court said it was wrong to deny inmates the vote but refused to order damages to be paid out to them.

The decision came after ten UK inmates had argued their human rights were breached by not being allowed to vote in the 2009 Euro elections. Judges also deprived ambulance-chasing lawyers of the chance of a fat pay day by dismissing their claims for costs in bringing the case. 

The European Court of Human Rights in the French city of Strasbourg has ruled that Britain's blanket ban on prisoners voting is illegal

They declared that the prisoners ‘only needed to fill in an application form’ and ‘did not need legal assistance’. This decision lifts the threat of huge payouts for more than 1,000 claims thought to be in the pipeline which are now unlikely to be brought.

However, the ruling on voting re-enforces a 2004 verdict that the UK’s blanket ban on convicted prisoners taking part in elections violated the European Convention on Human Rights.

Upholding this basic principle means that the row over prisoner voting will continue to dog David Cameron. It has become symbolic of the power struggle between Parliament and the European Court of Human Rights, and will add to Tory pressure for a showdown.

Yesterday the Daily Mail revealed that the court’s interference has persuaded Home Secretary Theresa May to advise Mr Cameron that Britain must withdraw from the Convention, which it exists to enforce.

Sources close to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said Labour’s Human Rights Act, which makes European rights part of British law, would be repealed if the Tories win next year’s election.

‘Decisions like these should be made in this country,’ they said.

‘A Tory government will make wholesale changes to human rights laws so this kind of decision will be taken by Parliament – not an international court.’

The latest twist in the battle over prisoners came after seven judges ruled that ten men held in Scottish jails were wrongly barred from the 2009 poll.

Two judges had dissented, condemning the court’s thinking as a mess and insisting there was nothing wrong with the UK law. They added the prisoners were wrong not to disclose details of their sentences to the court.

But the two were in a minority and the Strasbourg court reiterated its condemnation of the centuries-old British practice of barring prisoners from voting.

On rejecting any compensation, they declared that the satisfaction of having their complaint upheld was enough of a remedy for the ten inmates.

The refusal to pay legal costs chiefly affected Taylor and Kelly, solicitors based in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire. The firm has been involved in a number of claims over the issue.

In 2004, the first test case on prisoner voting, involving axe killer John Hirst, forced the Government to pay nearly £10,000 in legal costs. During a second major case in 2010, the Strasbourg court offered £4,000 in legal costs to two other Scottish prisoners represented by Taylor and Kelly.

The row with Europe has troubled both Labour and Tory governments. Successive Prime Ministers have stood by the ban and it has been endorsed by MPs in repeated debates and votes, most recently in 2011. Yesterday the Ministry of Justice said any decision on whether prisoners can vote will remain a matter for British MPs.

Eurosceptic Tories said the court had made a political retreat in the face of warnings of a UK withdrawal from EU institutions. Clacton MP Douglas Carswell said the decision was ‘a rare outbreak of commonsense from this federalist court’.
