Boston Marathon bombing victim Jeff Bauman has revealed how he was so certain Tamerlan Tsarnaev was one of his attackers that he tried to tell staff in the ambulance on his way to hospital.

Authorities have praised the 27-year-old, who lost his lower legs and much of his hearing in the blast, as key to stopping Tsarnaev and his brother Dzhokhar after he helped identify them as the suspects.

Bauman, who is learning to walk again with prosthetic limbs, has now spoken out about how he was determined to identify Tsarnaev after seeing him acting suspiciously before the April 15 blast.

'He wasn't with anybody, he was standing right next to me,' Bauman told Brian Williams on NBC News. He 'looked kind of -  wasn't laughing, wasn't having fun.'

Speaking out: In his first TV interview, Jeff Bauman said he told ambulance staff who was responsible for the Boston bombings. 'I had a hunch,' he said after seeing one of the suspects in the crowd

Recovery: Speaking to Brian Williams, Bauman said he is stronger than ever following his devastating injuries

This was noticeable among the crowd of people who were soaking up the celebratory atmosphere, said Bauman, who was at the finish line with two friends to cheer for his girlfriend as she raced.

After noticing Tamerlan Tsarnaev sullen faced, wearing a heavy coat, sunglasses, a cap and standing alone silently, he said he left a backpack behind. Moments later, there was an explosion.

Bauman was thrown by the force of the blast and opened his eyes to find himself in a pool of blood. He saw one of his friends look at his legs in horror and looked down to see his limbs were shredded.

A man applied tourniquets to his legs and then he was scooped into a wheelchair by Carlos Arredondo - a man in a cowboy hat - who helped rush him to an ambulance.

Spotted: He said he noticed Tamerlan Tsarnaev, right, as he did not fit in with the rest of the crowd. Tamerlan, who was killed after a police shootout, is pictured with his younger brother Dzhokhar

Identified: He helped authorities identify Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, and his brother Dzhokhar, right, as suspects

A photograph of the moment - showing Bauman gray-faced with nothing but exposed bone below his knees - has become an iconic image of the terror inflicted on the city that day.

Once in the ambulance, he tried to explain what he had witnessed.

'Even in the ambulance ride I was trying
to say something, trying to say, like, "I knew who did it, I knew what 
went on",' he said. 'And then I think they were kind of thrown back by that.'

He said that his first thought was to make sure no one else fell victim to the men. He became emotional as he mentioned Sean Collier, the MIT police officer allegedly shot dead by the brothers.

'I just wanted to get a face out there,' he said. 'And just to help. I just wanted to help.'

Bravery: Bauman is now learning how to walk with prosthetic legs, left, and right, he is pictured with the man he credits for saving his life - Carlos Arredondo. They have become close friends since the attacks

Closer: Carlos told Brian Williams that they are forever connected through their experiences. They speak daily

Tamerlan Tsarnaev died following a police shootout on April 19, several days after the bombings. On Wednesday, his brother Dzhokhar pleaded not guilty to the 30 charges against him.

Bauman added that he is now looking forward and, while he could wonder how differently he could have acted that day to avoid the blast, there is no point.

Instead, he is focusing on his recovery and said that he was nicknamed 'Wolverine' because he has healed from his wounds so quickly.

'It's insane,' he said. 'I'm a quick healer. They were calling me 'Wolverine'. It’s an X-Men, the guy that heals really quick, because I have burns... But [after] four weeks… my burns were almost gone.'

Throughout the weeks since April 15, he has also shared his physical recovery and emotional struggles with the New York Times.

His right eardrum was destroyed when 
the bomb detonated, and his left one suffered a sizable hole, which 
doctors have said is unlikely to heal.

On
the day of the bombings, he underwent an emergency amputation to remove
his legs at the knees, and two days later, flesh was amputated until 
four inches above the knees.

In the weeks after the explosion, Bauman struggled with pain and boredom.

Two weeks on, and he was still being kept awake by burns on his back and by the pains in his thighs. He told the Times that he felt as if someone was hitting his knees.

He also struggled to adjust to his loss of hearing, and said he felt as if he had something held over his ears. The frustrations and echoes still mean he can only play music for a few minutes and is uncomfortable in large rooms.

But he has refused to undergo surgery to close the hole in his left eardrum because he cannot face anymore operations, he said.

As
he started to heal from his operations, he spent days in hospital 
undergoing physical therapy, watching television and getting visits from
friends and his girlfriend - the highlight of the day.

He said that in those following weeks, he accepted what had happened and while he couldn't look at his legs, he would surprise people by joking about them as a way to cope.

He added that he didn't think of the bombers and only called them cowards when someone asked.

Bauman left the rehabilitation center around four weeks after the bombings and returned to his mother's home in Chelmsford, Massachusetts.

He would spend all day with his mother, with the only change in pace coming from his cousin, who came over to play computer games, and from his girlfriend, who would visit after work.

Staying strong: Bauman is pictured with his girlfriend, Erin Hurley. He said her visits to hospital or to his home are the highlights of his day and that he is looking forward to a future with her

Together: The couple had been together for around a year before the Boston bombings

Eventually, he began to venture out more
- but said he would rarely pay for anything because people recognized 
him and would shower him with praise and pick up his tab.

He has also made appearances at local games, including throwing the first pitch at Fenway Park - and has become firm friends with Carlos Arredondo, whom he was reunited with in hospital.

And he is also learning to walk after being fitted with the prosthetic legs.

Images taken on the day of his first walk show him grinning as he tries out his first steps.

His girlfriend stood nearby and watched apprehensively as he moved forward, but he assured her that he felt balanced.

Now Bauman is looking to the future - and hopes to one day buy a house with his girlfriend. He said that the tragedy has brought them much closer and made them more affectionate.

Before the bombings, Bauman worked in the delicatessen at a local Costco. He told the Times he had intentions of returning but that he was worried about being able to stand up all day. He said he had also thought about a career helping other people.

Online fundraisers have helped raise enough money to cover his medical costs - and he has received nearly $3 million from donations and from the One Fund, which helps the Boston victims.

But while he is becoming more independent and appreciating the attention he has been given, he added that he would trade it all just to have his legs back.
