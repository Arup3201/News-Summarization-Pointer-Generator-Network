Wigan and Huddersfield kick off the Super League play-offs on Thursday, just as they launched the regular season more than seven months earlier, and the Giants are confident of obtaining a similar result.

Paul Anderson's men stunned the 2013 champions by pulling off a 24-8 victory at the DW Stadium in early February, just before the Warriors set off for Australia to play in the World Club Challenge.

Wigan lost just once more at home in Super League as they went on to secure a second-place finish thanks to impressive back-to-back wins over Leeds and Warrington - but Huddersfield will have no fears about travelling to the DW Stadium, where they have won on seven of their last 10 visits.

Wigan Warriors captain Sean O'Loughlin is determined to end his team's hoodoo over Huddersfield, with Giants' forward Brett Ferres is hoping his side can improve on a disappointing season last term

Warriors captain Sean O'Loughlin said: 'They've been a bogey team for us over the last couple of years.

'They play well against us and we know we'll have to play as well as we did in the last couple of games if we want to get a win.

'The last two games have both been like play-off games, where both sides wanted the result. They were both tough, physical games which are what the play-offs are going to be like.'

Huddersfield, who topped the league in 2013 for the first time for 81 years, ended the regular season as the form team with six wins and a draw from their last seven matches, including a nailbiting triumph over leaders St Helens last Friday.

It meant they finished level on points with Wigan, although with an inferior points difference.

However, the Giants have a woeful record in play-off rugby, with nine defeats from 11 ties so far, including one to Wigan in the 2013 play-offs at the John Smith's Stadium.

'We were disappointed what we dished up last year but it's a new squad, it's a new season and we've been able to put a lot of things right that we maybe did wrong last year,' said Huddersfield's England forward Brett Ferres.

'We're looking forward to it. It's play-off time and everyone gets excited at this time of year. This is what we've played all year for and it's the time to shine.

'It's nice to have a bit of form and we've certainly some confidence from last week. It was a must-win game and we came through the first test.

O'Loughlin knows his Wigan Warriors side are in for a stiff test against Huddersfield on Thursday night

'We're battle hardened and I think we're ready for play-off football.

'I think it's the norm now at Huddersfield, we're expected to be in the play-offs. I think we've crept under the radar this year but we've knocked off some decent teams.'

While Wigan are virtually at full-strength, Huddersfield are still without their inspirational captain Danny Brough, who has failed to recover from a groin injury sustained in the win over Hull a fortnight ago.

However, Ferres, who shares the responsibility of captaincy with Luke Robinson in the absence of Brough, believes the win over Saints demonstrated that the Giants are no one-man team.

'We don't believe it in house but everyone keeps telling us we can't win a game without Danny Brough and that Huddersfield Giants are nothing without Danny Brough,' Ferres said.

'But I think the younger lads and people who have stepped up to play in the halves have certainly proved that we can play without Danny Brough and we can beat a very good side without Danny Brough.'

Anderson has the services of full-back or stand-off Scott Grix, who missed the last match with a groin injury, but Ferres will have every confidence in teenager Jake Connor if he is asked to once more take on a playmaking role.

Ferres said: 'He's been a very good player for a couple of seasons in the academy and he's gradually worked his way into the first team.

'He's had a couple of shots now and proved what a good player he is. He's one of the most talented and gifted lads you'll see playing.

'He's got an unbelievable skill set and now it's just about maturing and kicking on.'
