15 people and counting have been charged after an enormous 300-person street brawl broke out in Mount Isa, Queensland.

Police were called to Gardner Street and Able Smith Parade at 4.25 am on Saturday morning after multiple complaints of fighting and property damage.

All of the rostered staff attended the scene, however off duty officers, The Tactical Crime Squad and the Dog Squad had to be called in as back up.

15 people have been charged with public nuisance after a 300-person brawl broke out in Mount Isa

The riot is believed to have stemmed from a family feud that spilled onto the street. 

The ABC have reported that the violent brawl took an hour and a half and 16 officers to dissipate.

A 19-year-old woman was charged with serious assault after she was allegedly in possession of a knife and headbutted a female police officer who was uninjured.

15 others were charged with public nuisance and willful damage.

The fight involved people brandishing fence palings and broken bottles as weapons.

Surprisingly, no one was injured.

The brawl took 16 police officers, including the Dog Squad and Tactical Crime Squad to contain

Smaller groups were allegedly fighting within the larger group and alcohol is believed to be the cause for the incident.

Mount Isa Police Inspector Trevor Kidd has labelled the fight as 'ridiculous behaviour,' the Townsville Bulliten have reported.

'The situation escalated to the point where people involved were damaging fence lines and property along the street,' he said.

'Family feuding and alcohol seem to be the key issues and we are investigating why it got to this point.' 

Investigations into the incident are continuing and more charges are expected to be laid.
