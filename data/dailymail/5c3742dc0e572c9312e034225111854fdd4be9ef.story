Ed Balls insisted Labour was not ‘profligate’ with taxpayers’ money yesterday – while demanding £44billion of extra government spending.

The Shadow Chancellor suggested Britain should immediately pump nearly £23billion of public cash into the economy to kickstart the recovery.

And he said Labour opposes a further £21billion of cuts the Government is already making.

Mr Balls sought to win back authority for Labour on the economy by saying he would submit to ‘iron discipline’ on spending if the party gained  power again.

But he was accused of having ‘zero credibility’ because he flatly refused to apologise for Labour’s wasteful use of public cash, which left Britain vulnerable before the financial crash.

Opponents also pointed out that he could make all the extravagant claims he wants because, with an election up to four years away, they will never be tested.

‘Don’t let anyone tell you that Labour in government was profligate with public money,’ he told the party conference in Liverpool.

And later at a fringe meeting, he said he has no intention of apologising for Labour’s public spending record.

‘I don’t believe in a mea culpa strategy,’ he said.

‘The Tories would like nothing better 
than for me to say that public spending caused the crisis but it’s just 
not true.

I think politically it would be very foolish.’

In his first speech to conference as Shadow Chancellor, he set out a five-point plan to kick-start the flagging economy.

He called for an immediate one-year cut in VAT to 5 per cent on home improvements, repairs and maintenance.

The Treasury said that would cost £2.2billion – four times Mr Balls’s estimate of £500million.

He also demanded a one-year National 
Insurance tax break for every small firm which takes on extra workers – a
fresh cost of £900million.

Eastern European workers should face restrictions on their movement to prevent big business benefiting from ‘cheap labour’ at the expense of British workers, one of Ed Miliband’s closest advisers said yesterday.

Lord Glasman, a personal friend of the Labour leader, also said Spanish trawlers should be restricted from fishing in British waters.

In a Eurosceptic-tinged intervention at the party conference, the peer launched a stinging attack on New Labour, saying it had built a strong economy before the recession on the back of cheap labour from abroad.

Lord Glasman called on Mr Miliband to challenge the EU on its doctrine of free movement of labour.

‘The idea that workers in Poland are working in an equivalent economic space to workers here is just not true,’ he said.

‘Wages are far, far lower there so the incentives to move and come where wages are higher – that disrupts family life, that disrupts economic growth in Poland and creates a dependent culture. I think we should have a treaty change to stop it. The idea that treaties cannot be negotiated is anti-political.’

At another fringe meeting, former Communities Secretary Hazel Blears admitted that under Labour, ‘immigration was too high, too fast; communities changed before people’s eyes and put strain on public services’.

She added: ‘This is how people feel. It’s almost like we’re frightened to say it. I think we got this sense that we have got this great melting pot which is London and some of our big cities. But that’s not necessarily reflected in other communities.

‘We can’t have a party that’s simply London-centric that looks through the prism of a very multi-cultural community but also a very middle-class community.

That isn’t the reality for very many people out there.’

MP Margaret Hodge said mass immigration was here to stay and politicians are ‘lying’ if they claim they will slash it.

She said all parties should stop ‘competing on numbers’ and instead focus on tackling feelings that the system is unfair. She insisted the Government’s vow to cut net immigration to the tens of thousands ‘will fail’.

Mr Balls said Labour would reverse January’s rise in VAT – costing £12.1billion – and bring forward capital investment projects at a likely cost of £8billion.

‘Call it Plan A-plus. Call it Plan B. Call it Plan C. I don’t care want they call it – Britain just needs a plan that works,’ he said.

His aides claimed the proposals would be financed by slowing the speed of deficit reduction – condemning Britain to years more with the national credit card in arrears.

Mr Balls admitted that if Labour won power in 2015 he would not be able to reverse all the Coalition’s austerity measures.

But he condemned cuts to the police, child benefit, tax credits, pensions, the axing of the Future Jobs Fund and regional development agencies.

Without those savings, government borrowing would be £21billion higher than now – bringing the black hole in Labour’s plans to a staggering £44billion.

Mr Balls acknowledged that there was no area in which it was more important for Labour to win the public’s trust than on the economy.

With the world facing ‘the darkest, most dangerous times for the global economy in my lifetime’, Britain is threatened with ‘a lost decade of economic stagnation’ if growth is not revived, he warned.

The Conservative programme of deep and swift cuts is ‘not working’ and risks plunging the world into a 1930s-style depression, he added.

Mr Balls claimed Labour bequeathed the Coalition a golden economic inheritance. In fact total debt rose between 1997 and 2010 from a little under £350billion to more than £550billion.

The highly respected Institute of Fiscal Studies has concluded: ‘On the eve of the financial crisis, the UK had one of the largest structural budget deficits among either the G7 or the OECD countries.’ 

And both Tony Blair and former Chancellor Alistair Darling have  admitted that Labour was spending too much.

Mr Balls sought to curry favour with voters by admitting Labour made mistakes on bank regulation, the 10p tax rate, Gordon Brown’s paltry 75p pension rise and on immigration from Eastern Europe.

But he also resorted to a crude class-war attack on David Cameron, George Osborne and Boris Johnson, saying those with ‘independent means’ did not care about those suffering in the downturn.

Justine Greening, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘This speech failed the credibility test. Everyone can see that Ed Balls is dangerously addicted to debt.

A teenage schoolboy became the star of the Labour Party Conference and was hailed as ‘brilliant’ after a rousing speech in which he ripped into the 'vicious' Coalition.

In echoes of a teenage William Hague addressing the Tory conference in 1977, Rory Weal received a standing ovation from thousands of delegates and had Ed Miliband rushing to shake his hand.

Rory, 16, who lives with his mother Elaine and eight-year-old sister Emma in Maidstone, Kent, had the week off school to attend the conference.He became involved with politics after his family home was repossessed as his mother struggled to find work.

He told thousands of activists: ‘Two-and-a-half years ago, the home I had lived in since birth was repossessed.

‘I owe my entire well-being and that of my family to the welfare state. That is why I joined the Labour Party.

‘That very same welfare state is being ruthlessly ripped apart by a vicious, Right-wing, Tory-led Government.

‘I wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for that system, that safety net. So I take this opportunity to plead with the Government to reconsider their measures.

‘Their measures for young people, which will divide a generation and seriously threaten the British promise that Ed Miliband has spoken about, where one generation does better than the last.

'Their measures on welfare, such as the housing benefit cap, which will potentially make 40,000 people homeless and hammer the most vulnerable people in society.’

His impassioned plea was hailed as 'brilliant' by Ed Balls. Rory is studying four A-levels – English literature, geography, politics and history – at Oakwood Park Grammar in his home town, having gained seven A*s and four As in his GCSEs.

After the speech, he said: ‘I think a lot of my friends are quite angry at what this Government is doing with tuition fees.

'It's important to get more young people involved.'

Rory, who only joined the party after the last general election, said he did not know what he wanted to do after school but added he would 'quite like to go into politics in the future'.
