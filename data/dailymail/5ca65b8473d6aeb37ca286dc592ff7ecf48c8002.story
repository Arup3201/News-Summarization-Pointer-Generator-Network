These Chinese women have taken their long hair to new lengths making a Guinness World Record as the world’s first long hair village.

The Red Yao women, a minority ethnic group from Huangluo Yao Village in China, have an average hair length of 5.5 feet. The longest locks measure more than 6.8 feet.

Incredibly, the women cut their hair only once in their lives, at 16-years-old, before they start their search for a husband.

Wrap around: This Red Yao woman is one of 120 whose hair averages 5.5 feet long in the world's first long hair village

Huge hairstyle: The woman demonstrates the ancient art of the 'up do', twisting and wrapping her jet black hair with ease, a feat most hairdressers would balk at

Thought to be so sacred that only their husband or child could look upon their locks, if a man happen to stumble upon a woman not wearing her scarf, he was forced to live with her family for three years as their son-in-law.

Their hair, an ancient tradition, could only be let down in the presence of close family but the women abandoned tradition in 1987.

The 120 women now proudly show off their massive heads of hair in their village. They are known throughout China as the 'long hair village'.

Forbidden fruit: Their hair was once kept hidden from view to everyone but their husband or child but now the women proudly show off their amazing tresses

Washing women: During the summer and autumn months the women wash their hair in the river

While many women would be daunted with the 
task of managing hair this long, the Red Yao women make hairstyling look
easy as they twist and wrap their mane, flicking it as they go.

The Red Yao people believe that the women’s long hair brings longevity, wealth and good fortune.

The longer the hair, the more fortunate one would be.

During the summer and autumn months, the women wash their hair in the Jinjiang River.

Ancient tradition: Before 1987, if a man saw a Red Yao woman's hair they would be forced to live with her family for three years as their son-in-law

Good fortune: The Red Yao people believe a woman's long hair brings longevity, wealth and good fortune
