The bisexual soldier involved in the topless barmaids controversy has spoken out, in an attempt to 'set the record straight' and stop the military from 'screwing over another great soldier' by fixing a system 'willing to manipulate and lie to get rid of those they don't like'.

Following a sexual encounter with an another solider, Corporal Ezekiel Wilkinson's sexuality became widely known in the Defence Force, which he believes prompted an investigation into him allegedly dealing peptides, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Mr Wilkinson insists the intimacy between him and the other soldier was consensual, despite text messages he received.

Angered by the investigation, Mr Wilkinson's mother, without her son's knowledge, exposed photos of topless barmaids from a base in WA in an attempt to prove 'double standards' in Defence's attitude to her son's bisexuality.

Corporal Ezekiel Wilinson said once his relationship between him and the other solider became public, complaints about his alleged dealing of peptides began

'What you did was so wrong on so many levels... what you did to me when I was trying to go to bed was f**ked-up.'

He said once his relationship between him and the other solider became public, complaints about his alleged dealing of peptides began.

'I have been isolated from my military friends... I am being discriminated against,' he said.

But a Defence spokesman said, 'Defence maintains its commitment to an inclusive and diverse workplace and does not investigate matters based on member's sexual orientation.'

The 29-year-old Afghanistan veteran denied dealing in peptides, and said he bought them legally in Australia to treat his neck injury he suffered in Afghanistan, after an improvised explosive blew up near him.

The controversial barmaid photos, which appeared on ninemsn, show soldiers in the company of topless women, one of whom is tattooed and blonde.

Defence banned the barmaids from attending the Gratwick Club which is located next to the Special Air Service Regiment barracks in Swanbourne, Western Australia.

Another photo shows a brunette woman with pink nail polish holding up a peace sign in the foreground of a photo, with uniformed soldiers pictured sitting at tables in the background.

The mother of a former special forces soldier, who uncovered the photos, claims her son has been mistreated over his sexuality.

He's being investigatedÂ  by Defence over allegations he bought illegal medicine. She says the allegations are false and only occurred after officers discovered her son was bisexual in April, and show a 'double standard' in the defence force because topless barmaids are allowed in government-owned clubs.

'The actual allegations (about the medicine) themselves have come from a person who had issues with my son's sexuality,' she told the Herald.

'He is being discriminated against because of his sexuality, about which he was open, by the same management that condones women being exploited in the manner of those photographs.'

This comes amid mounting calls for a royal commission into the military's handling of abuse claims and the abolition of the Australian Defence Force Academy following a number of claims over the past two decades that cadets and soldiers were assaulted and raped.

Recently ABC TV's Four Corners program aired fresh stories from four former female cadets who claim to have been raped, sexually assaulted or denigrated while at ADFA in the 1990s and 2009.

The women criticised the military's response to abuse claims - the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce - as inadequate.

They have also been joined by former Australian Defence Force magistrate Ken Northwood, Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie and lawyer Gary Rumble - who led a review into ADFA abuse allegations - in calling for a royal commission to fully uncover the extent of abuse and hold the perpetrators to account.
