Tiger Woods is trying out some new courses.

The top golfer announced Tuesday he is opening a Florida restaurant called The Woods Jupiter: Sports and Dining Club next year.

A statement issued by developer Allied Capital and Development of South Florida says the property is still in the works, but is expected to be a 5,900-square-foot restaurant. It's likely to open in early 2015.

Woods said in the statement that he envisions 'a place where people can meet friends, watch sports on TV and enjoy a great meal.'

'I wanted to build it locally where I live and where it could help support the community,' Woods added. 

The restaurant will be located in a new shopping center development called Harbourside, which is set to fully open in October.

The $150million development will feature an amphitheater, marina, restaurants and shops and Woods says he's had his eyes on the property for two years.

'I couldn’t be more excited to have Tiger’s new establishment operating within Harbourside Place,' Developer Nick Mastroianni told the Palm Beach Post. 'It’s gratifying to see the final stages met with support from local, national and international organizations such as Mr. Woods.'
