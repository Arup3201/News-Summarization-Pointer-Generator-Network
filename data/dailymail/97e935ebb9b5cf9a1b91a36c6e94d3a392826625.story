An openly gay journalist was brutally beaten in Midtown earlier this month and the incident is now being investigated as a hate crime.

A candlelight vigil was held on Sunday night for the award winning arts journalist Randy Gener, 45, who has worked for The New York Times, The New York Daily News, American Theater Magazine, and NPR to name a few.

CBS reports that Randy was on his way home from a Broadway show premiere party early on January 17 when he was attacked near West 54 street and Seventh Avenue, just a few minutes away from his apartment. 

Police also believe the assault could have been a so-called 'knockout game' attack.

The suspect: A Hispanic male in his 20s who is 6 ft tall and weighs approximately 160 pounds was last seen wearing black jeans and a black jacket

Boyculture.com reports that the NYPD just released information about the possible attacker. He is described as a Hispanic male in his 20s who is approximately 160 lbs with short black hair. He was last seen wearing black jeans and a black jacket.

The suspect allegedly punched Gener in the face then fled the scene by quickly jumping into a grey four door Nissan with the Mississippi license plate #KAT397.

Last night's vigil took place near the scene of the unfortunate attack. The vigil had two purposes: one purpose was to commemorate Gener and the other purpose was to put put pressure on NYPD to capture the suspect.

'Three more minutes he would have been in his own bed,' Randy's partner Stephen Nisbet said to CBS.

'He got hit really hard on the head so he suffered traumatic brain injuries,' Nisbet said.

Gener has undergone brain surgery at St.Lukes hospital and is scheduled to have another operation.

Gener's friend Liz Casasola told CBS that Gener is, 'coming in and out of consciousness, and he is not quite aware of whatâ€™s going on.'

Randy was attacked just moments before he would have arrived back at his apartment

Family and friends hope that Randy Gener will have a speedy recovery from his 'traumatic brain injury'

Friends and Family attended a vigil to honor their friend and to put pressure on the NYPD to find a suspect

'Heâ€™s always there for everyone in the theater and Filipino community, 
itâ€™s hard to picture it happening to someone like him,' Casasola continued.

Genr's sister Jessica Blair- Driessler told reporters that his recovery may last up to six months or a year.

A source who wished to remain anonymous said that police are investigating the possibility of Gener's attack as part of 'the knockout game' in which brutal attacks such as Gener's are unsolicited and performed at random.

NYPD have also brought in the hate crime team to investigate the assault which took place near Broadway, where Gener was attending a theater premiere.

This reporter, who met Randy Gener years ago while interning at Theatre Communications Group where he was employed by American Theater Magazine, remembers Gener as a warm and welcoming colleague dedicated to making people laugh.

The Mail Online spoke with Martha Neighbors, a close friend and former colleague of Gener's.

'Randy is one of the great minds, and the thought that his beautiful brain is damaged in a truly senseless and appalling attack is just too much to bear. No one, anywhere at any time, should be subject to physical or verbal assault for being who they are. This has to stop,' she said.

She also said Randy has the 'uncanny ability' to find his friends the perfect Christmas gift.

She described him as having a 'beautiful soul.'
