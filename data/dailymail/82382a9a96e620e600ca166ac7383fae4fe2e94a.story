One of the star witnesses at Michael Jackson's 2005 trial who adamantly denied that he had ever been molested by the singer has now changed his story as he fights for money from Jackson's estate.

Wade Robson, 30, a top music choreographer who has worked with Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, knew Jackson decades ago when he went for sleepovers at the Neverland Ranch.

On May 1, Robson filed legal requests for financial compensation from the singer's estate for 'childhood sexual abuse.' Then on Wednesday his lawyer told TMZ that Jackson was a 'monster' who sexually abused Wade for seven years, and even threatening him if he ever went public.

Attorney Henry Gradstein told TMZ, 'Last year, on a career trajectory that was off the charts, [Wade] collapsed under the stress and sexual trauma of what had happened to him for seven years as a child.'

Gradstein continued: 'He [Wade] lived with the brain washing by a sexual predator until the burden of it all crushed him.'

The lawyer also claimed that Jackson threatened the younger man, saying: 'If anyone ever finds out about what we did we will go to jail for the rest of our lives.'

Gradstein told TMZ that Wade was 
silenced as a result: 'This kind of intimidation of a child by a sexual 
predator is tragically characteristic and effective, keeping them quiet 
about the abuse - often for a lifetime.'

He concludes with: 'Michael Jackson was a monster and in their hearts every normal person knows it.'

Robson's legal motion, which has been
filed under seal so it is not available to the public, comes years 
after he made repeated public statements defending Jackson and denying 
any wrongdoing.

The two met when Robson was five years old and Jackson was in his late 20s or early 30s.

They bonded over a love of music and he repeatedly slept over his house and spent nights in the same bed as the much-older singer.

Robson played a pivotal role in the 2005 trial, when Jackson faced 14 counts relating to child molestation and conspiracy to molest minors.

He was found not guilty on all of the charges, and Robson was one of the star witnesses who defended Jackson, saying that he was never inappropriately touched or molested.

A similar defense was given by their 
mutual friend Macaulay Culkin, who also slept over the singer's ranch 
over a long period of time.

In
the past eight years, Robson has made a name for himself in the 
entertainment world, becoming one of the most sought-after 
choreographers.

He has
worked with Usher, Britney Spears, and NSYNC. His name hit the gossip 
columns in 2002 when Britney Spears' relationship with Justin Timberlake
ended after she allegedly cheated on the NSYNC star with the 
choreographer.

Since then, Robson has worked on the show So You Think You Can Dance, and is currently in charge of Demi Lovato's choreography.

But on May 5, TMZ
reported that they heard from unidentified legal sources that Robson's
legal team filed papers asking for an undisclosed sum from the Jackson 
estate on May 1. No other details about the filing have been released, 
but they reportedly give an explicit detail of the alleged assault.

News of the filing came on the same day that the late singer's autopsy report revealed that Michael Jackson tattooed his lips pink, permanently inked his eyebrows and relied on a dark tattoo to blend his hairline into his wig.

As the high profile trial of the singer's tour promoter, AEG, continues, a disturbing photograph of the fallen pop star's corpse was shown to the court on Monday by Dr Christopher Rogers.

His coroner's report described a man 
whose struggle to hide a skin pigmentation disease forced him to mask 
his true features but who would have lived a long life had he not 
overdosed on propofol.

The revelation of Jackson's permanent
make-up comes during the trial brought by the singer's mother 
and children who claim AEG shares blame in his death for neglecting to 
vet and supervise Mr Jackon's doctor, Dr Conrad Murray.
