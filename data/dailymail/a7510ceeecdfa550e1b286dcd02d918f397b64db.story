Gerry Fortuna became a hit after an email he sent at Channel Nine about a colleague went viral

It seems the luck of the Sydney IT worker who rose to notoriety after proclaiming his love for a Channel Nine colleague on his farewell email just hasn't changed.

Mr Fortuna has now confessed to 'winning' a poker machine jackpot ... of just three cents.

And the 28-year-old admitted his luck with the ladies hasn't changed since he was rejected by Mia at Channel Nine, admitting he's 'still available'.

The former Channel Nine worker rose to fame in March when he sent an email to more than 1000 colleagues professing his 'long term crush' on Mia.

His latest turn of bad luck came while he was drinking with a few mates in Sydney's inner west, and decided to put some money in the pokies.

Clearly a sucker for public humiliation, Mr Fortuna posted his 'win' on Instagram.

But Mr Fortuna was still looking on the bright side on his recent tales of misfortune, telling the Daily Mail Australia: 'I know my surname is Fortuna but I'm anything but fortunate.'

'Love, gambling...the list can go on.'

He did say, however, that he had plans for investing his three cents into some everyday expenses or even a 'holiday.'

'I'll probably just put it towards some fuel, that's really expensive now, or even a holiday.'

'I just thought it would be funny, taking this ticket to the counter and asking for my three cents.'

'The woman just looked at me and scratched her head, thinking 'how do I do this?'

'I think the funniest part of the night was her reaction.'

Unlucky: Mr Fortuna lost $19.97 after putting in an initial investment of $20 into a pokie machine at a pub at Ashfield in Sydney's inner west

The girl believed to be Mia (centre), was part of the inspiration for Gerry Fortuna's 1,4000-word farewell email

Back in March, after six years at Channel Nine, Mr Fortuna finally summoned the courage to announce his love for a colleague when he shared a 14,000-word farewell email with 1000 Channel Nine staff.

In it, he admitted he had never had the 'guts to tell anyone' how he felt, but thought what better time than his final day to let his emotions escape.

'Now I never had the guts to tell anyone at work what I’m about to say, it would be unprofessional, however I’m leaving so it doesn’t matter,' he wrote in the email.

'This may or may not come as a surprise to you as I don’t think you ever knew Mia, but now that I’m leaving it won’t matter ... I think you’re really cute in a beautiful way.

In the days after the email went viral, Mr Fortuna took to Twitter to react to the public response.

'Hopefully this sudden attention does not tarnish my reputation or career! Hope Mia is doing okay... What a ride so far! Still in shock...'

However, he told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday the pair have cut ties and haven't spoken since: 'Me and her were friends ... we worked it all out but then when it went viral s*** got real, so we decided not to talk.'

For those ladies wondering: 'Yes, still single,' he said.

Is he looking? 'Not really looking, I mean ... I wouldn't say I'm not not looking.'

At the time a A Nine spokeswoman declined to comment, saying: 'It was a personal email and we won’t be commenting.'
