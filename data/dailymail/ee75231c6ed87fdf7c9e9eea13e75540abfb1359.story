It would appear to be the perfect way to show patriotic support for our sportsmen and women – and also keep the sun off.

But the official Olympics scarf, unveiled yesterday, has become the latest in a long list of souvenirs for the London Games to be revealed as made outside of the UK.  

The initial run of 500,000 of the bandana-style cotton sheets will be produced at a Next factory in India, with subsequent orders made in either Portugal or Turkey.

It comes just days after the Daily Mail revealed just 9 per cent of the 2012 memento collection is made here.

The scarf will be available in Next stores in May, costing £5 for a 20in one or £10 for a 35in version.

All proceeds will go to the British Olympic Association and British Paralympic Association and it is hoped it will raise up to £10million for the athletes.

The cotton voile scarves feature the Team GB logo or the British Paralympic Association logo on a background of more than 2,000 black ‘hieroglyphs’ – symbols representing the Olympic sports and London.

The symbols include 900 figures to represent the 900 Team GB and Paralympics GB athletes, 900 hearts ‘to express the nation’s special love’, 900 stars ‘to recognise that every one of our athletes is a true star’ and 60 hands to symbolise 60million GB supporters.

English roses, Welsh daffodils, Northern Irish flax and Scottish thistles also feature on the heavily-patterned scarf as well as national landmarks and the date of the opening ceremony.

The scarf has been described as ‘an iconic memento of the London 2012 Games’ and the BOA has agreed for Olympic sponsor Next to manufacture an initial run of 500,000 scarves.

Adidas, another sponsor, will have its logo on the scarves and help sell them through its outlets.

The scarves are one of two pieces of Olympic merchandise which the BOA are allowed to keep net profits from, following an agreement with the London 2012 organising committee.

The second item, a ‘collectable’ produced in partnership with BP, will be launched at the end of May.

The
association has spent more than two years working on the design for the
scarves, which come with a letter from five-time gold medallist Sir 
Steve Redgrave, encouraging people to ‘wear it, wave it and help Team GB
WIN with it!’

The BOA hopes to sell at least one million of the scarves, which some have described as looking like tea towels, in an attempt to mirror the success of the 2010 Vancouver winter Olympics – where 4.3m pairs of red mittens were sold, raising millions for the organising committee.

BOA chief executive Andy Hunt said the scarves were vital for building support for the games.

He said: ‘We would love it to be a massive success. Here is an item you can take to show you have gone out and supported the team.’

The scarves will be available online WHEN and in Next stores from May – but may not be on sale in any of the official London 2012 merchandise stores in Olympic venues, due to a row between the BOA and Locog, which controls the shops.

The BOA will have to share profits from any sales in initial shops with Locog, which needs merchandise income to meet the £2.2bn running costs of the Games.

The BOA also announced that it will be opening a museum close to the main stadium and aquatic centre in the Olympic Park after the Games. The £10m project will celebrate London’s status as the only city to have hosted the Olympics three times, and could include memorabilia from every member of Team GB at this summer’s event.
