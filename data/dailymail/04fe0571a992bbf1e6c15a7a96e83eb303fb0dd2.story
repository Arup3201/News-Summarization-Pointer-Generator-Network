Sentenced: John Burrows was jailed yesterday for running a lucrative brothel empire

A millionaire ex-solicitor was jailed yesterday for running a lucrative brothel empire.

John Burrows, who moved into the sex industry after being struck off for forging a dying client’s will, also faces losing his £900,000 home.

The 64-year-old owned a purported gentlemen’s club behind an anonymous-looking facade and claimed he made his money from cleaning drains and tackling vermin infestations.

The truth was revealed when Burrows made an allegation of blackmail, and policemen who visited the premises to interview him were mistaken for customers.

They were introduced to scantily-clad women who offered them sex for £50 an hour.

Burrows was arrested and appeared at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court where a suspended sentence imposed for running the same brothel in 2009 was activated, and he was jailed for 18 months.

The father of three, branded ‘a horrible creature’ by detectives, was also ordered to pay back £750,000 derived from crime, forcing him to put his ostentatious five-bedroom barn conversion on the market.

The house, near the Lancashire beauty spot of Chipping, features a 6ft model of the Statue of Liberty in  the hall.

Burrows was working as a solicitor in 1995 when he altered the will of Leslie Barnes as the ex-butcher was dying in hospital so that he received £2,000.

He was trapped when it emerged that the manufacturer of the paper on which he forged the will had changed its watermark for the first time in 100 years.

It also emerged that he had defrauded the law firm where he worked by falsifying cheques, and in 2000 he was jailed for four and a half years.

Burrows was struck off by the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Panel in 2002 for ‘unbefitting conduct’.

His subsequent venture, World Famous Babes, first came to the attention of the authorities in 1997.

Planners refused permission for the ‘health club’ in Swinton, Greater Manchester, to expand because neighbours complained of ‘obscene sounds and screams’ and clients’ expensive cars – Mercedes, Porsches and BMWs – parked in front of their houses.

Police raided the building in 2007 and found two clients engaged in sexual activity with prostitutes.

Financial records revealed that Burrows had been pocketing £20 out of each prostitute’s £50 hourly fee.

He was given a ten-month suspended prison sentence in 2009 and ordered to repay £750,000 in criminal assets or face jail.

Investigators say the money has yet to be repaid.

Police became aware that Burrows was still running the brothel only when he made an allegation of blackmail in 2010 and invited officers to interview him on the premises.

They were greeted at the door by a woman who, mistaking them for clients, introduced them to two prostitutes, Philip Dobson, prosecuting, told the court.

Burrows admitted running the brothel and another in Bury.

He also pleaded guilty to two counts of contempt of court for breaching a restraining order relating to the disposal of his assets.

Neighbours said they had no idea the wealthy businessman had made his money from prostitution.

‘John was quite ostentatious and showy, he liked to splash his cash around, going to nice restaurants, holding parties for his staff,’ said one.

One investigator said: ‘Burrows is  a really horrible creature, a proper crook.’
