Another day another diver! Referees are struggling to accurately identify what is simulation and what isn’t in the Premier League.

There is an inconsistent approach to this major issue and makes you consider the subjectivity of a lot of the incidents.

Here, Sportsmail columnist Graham Poll looks at the incidents from recent match weekends and explains where the inconsistencies have been in referees' decision making...

THE ISSUES

This weekend:

Of the three players above cautioned for diving I thought two were correct and one.

However, the three others should have been booked too.

Previous weekend:

The weekend before similar issues were highlighted in the Premier League:

Then, of course, the most startling caution for simulation this season came on November 30 when Mike Jones decided that Manchester City's Sergio Aguero had dived and cautioned him after he was clearly wiped out by Jose Fonte against Southampton at St Mary's Stadium.

THE DIFFICULTY IN DETECTING

What is clear is that the select group of referees in the Premier League are unable to consistently detect and punish the guilty parties whilst protecting those who are fouled.

This is partly down to the ability of the referees themselves but mostly due to the players and their approach. There is a tendency now for players to do two things which fuel the fire of inconsistency and they were in evidence this weekend.

Exaggerating contact:

Tottenham’s Harry Kane appeared to feel slight contact on his boot from behind as he was running into the penalty area. He stubbed his toe into the turf - which only he can know if that was deliberate - and went sprawling down. He certainly looked for a penalty and was clearly annoyed when Bobby Madley failed to award one. Had he been heading straight towards goal with a good chance to score then I am sure he would have stayed on his feet and tried to get a second for Spurs.

Anticipating contact:

Chelsea’s Costa saw Tom Huddlestone dangle a leg out in front of him and felt that, had he continued his normal run, he would have been knocked to the ground and perhaps injured. Therefore, to avoid contact with Huddlestone’s leg, he went over it. I would argue that the Hull player's action impeded his progress and so it was a foul. However, when Costa’s team-mate Gary Cahill thought that two Hull defenders were going to impede him, he jumped through the middle of them. They had withdrawn from their act and therefore Cahill had dived.

THE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS

Replays: 

These decisions are fine margins and subtle differences which are so hard to get right at full speed in the intensity of major football matches. Slow-motion replays help massively and as they are available it seems incongruous that the resource is not used. However, there appears to be no prospect of this being introduced in the foreseeable future.

Extra officials:

The widely-respected Pierluigi Collina is in favour of additional match officials helping out in all aspects of the game and this includes simulation. I have seen no evidence to suggest this helps and the higher the number of different people who look at subjective situations, the less consistent the action tends to be.

Retrospective action:

A few ex-players have mooted the idea of a panel sitting after match days to adjudicate on incidents of simulation. I think this is an excellent option; if just two people are allowed to sit together, perhaps an ex-player and a former referee, there will be greater consistency.

They should sit and adjudicate on incidents on a Monday and have the power to impose an immediate retrospective one-game ban for those found guilty who have already escaped the attention of the match-day referee.

But referees should still be encouraged to detect and punish at the time and given additional training to ensure they think in harmony with the panel, of who only two should sit at any one time.

What is clear is that some action is required - and quickly - before this spirals into an even bigger issue that affects every game.

Retrospective action should be introduced for incidents such as Cahill's dive against Hull
