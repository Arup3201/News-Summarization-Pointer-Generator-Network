'The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime' Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey, August 3, 1914

Prime Minister David Cameron is urging Britons to switch off their lights for an hour tomorrow evening to mark the 100th anniversary of Britain’s declaration of war on Germany in 1914.

The Lights Out initiative will be the culmination of a day of commemorative events across the country and in Europe, with members of the Royal Family fully involved at home and abroad.

Millions of homes, offices and public and private buildings, such as Tower Bridge and 10 Downing Street, will be included in the ‘shared moment of reflection’ between 10pm and 11pm, leaving just a single candle or bulb illuminating a window as a symbol of ‘continuing hope in the darkness’.

The initiative was inspired by then Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey’s remark at the outbreak of the First World War: ‘The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.’

Mr Cameron told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Lights Out is a way for everyone to mark the First World War centenary and I would encourage people to take part and turn off their lights tomorrow at 10pm for an hour, apart from a single light or candle.

‘This will be a personal gesture in remembrance of all those who made the ultimate sacrifice for us 100 years ago. They must never be forgotten.’

The national commemorations will begin with a morning service of prayers, hymns and readings in Glasgow Cathedral linked to the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games. 

The event will be attended by Commonwealth leaders, Mr Cameron and Prince Charles.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend a remembrance service in Liege, Belgium, before joining Prince Harry and Mr Cameron for a commemoration organised by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in Mons, where the first and last British soldiers who died on the Western Front are buried.

At 10pm, to coincide with the start of the ‘Lights Out’ initiative, a vigil service will be held at Westminster Abbey during which members of the congregation will extinguish candles until there is just one left alight on the tomb of the unknown soldier, which will be snuffed out by the Duchess of Cornwall.

During the day, there will be a number of Church of England services attended by other members of the Royal family including the Queen, who will be at Balmoral in Scotland, and Prince Philip, at Sandringham in Norfolk. 

Other special events will be held up and down the UK, including a commemorative service led by Sandhurst and District Corps of Drums in Berkshire.

Labour’s spokesman on the First World War commemorations, Dan Jarvis, said: ‘With the busy lives we lead today, the simple act of pausing, switching off the lights and lighting a candle will be a very powerful tribute.’
