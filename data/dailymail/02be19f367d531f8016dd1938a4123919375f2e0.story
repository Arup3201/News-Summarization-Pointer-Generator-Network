Wilfried Bony may be in red hot form, but the Swansea City forward seems to have found a good way to keep cool in between games.

Bony, who played in Swansea's 1-0 win over Aston Villa on Boxing Day, was pictured afterwards spending time in a cryochamber.

The picture, which showed the Ivorian forward in the small chamber, was posted to Twitter by Swansea's first team physio Kate Rees.

Bony is using the treatment to try and ensure he is fully fit to face Liverpool at Anfield on Monday night. 

Cryochamber use has become popular with athletes in the last few years as a way to aid quick recovery between matches. 

The small container can be cooled to temperatures of -120 degrees Celsius, and the player spends up to three minutes inside.

Bony thought he had scored a fifth goal in seven games, but was denied by the linesman's flag

Swansea have slightly longer than most Premier League teams between games in the busy Christmas period, but the turnaround is still only three days.

Bony has scored eight goals so far this season, including four in his last seven league games and is the leading Premier League goalscorer in 2014.
