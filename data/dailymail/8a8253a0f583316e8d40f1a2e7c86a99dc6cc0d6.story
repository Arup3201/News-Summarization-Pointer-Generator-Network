Zara Phillips was seen holding three-month-old baby Mia at her first competitive ride since giving birth three months ago.

The new mother was photographed cradling her beautiful baby girl shortly after taking part in the show jumping at the Symm International Horse Trials in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.

The Olympic silver medalist, whose appearance at the trials marks her first competitive ride since giving birth to her first child Mia, looked relaxed and happy as she made her way around the course on Mr Murt.

In other pictures, Zara was seen riding another novice horse CG Master Lux around the challenging course.

The mother has entered four horses in to the competition - Black Tuxedo and High Kingdom in the open intermediate class and Mr Murt and CG Master Lux in the open novices.

Zara was seen riding High Kingdom around her mother's Gloucestershire home in the days running up to the event - which runs across the Easter weekend.

It is believed she was riding around Princess Anne's Gatcombe Park  to practice for the event.

Speaking last week, the 32-year-old told the BBC she felt 'comfortable' being back in the saddle.

She said: 'I am much more comfortable now. When I first got back on it was nice to get back in the saddle but you're not very stable as your muscles aren't working well.

The Olympic medalist has recently revealed her plans to compete in the Brazil 2016 Olympics

'Then I went skiing at 6 weeks which you could think was crazy. Actually after that I was probably 50 per cent fitter than I would have been if I had stayed at home training for a week.'

Zara, who quit competitive riding last summer due to her pregnancy, became the first royal to win an Olympic medal at the London 2012 games as part of the British eventing team.

The competitor has said she wants to take part in the 2016 Brazil games - and that she is aiming for gold.

She told BBC Breakfast's Sally Nugent: 'I definitely want a gold. It would be fantastic to go to another Olympics.

'Unfortunately, it's every four years so you've got to try to stay at the top level and have good results.'

Zara told the BBC she was enjoying motherhood, adding: 'I have really enjoyed it.

'Getting your body back is the hardest. But I'm lucky - she's been great she has been sleeping and eating so I think I am very lucky.'

Zara, who is married to former England rugby player Mike Tindall, gave birth to baby Mia at the end of January. Mia is the Queenâ€™s fourth great-grandchild - and is 16th in line to the throne.

Earlier this month, Tindall's horse Monbeg Dude - which he co-owns and was part trained by Zara - came seventh in the Grand National.
