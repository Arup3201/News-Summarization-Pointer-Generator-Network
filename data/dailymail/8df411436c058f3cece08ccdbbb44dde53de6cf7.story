Daniele de Rossi has been omitted from Italy's squad to face Spain in a friendly for punching opponent Mauro Icardi during Roma's Serie A feisty clash with Inter Milan.

As the pair waited for a ball to arrive in the penalty area, De Rossi swung a right arm from behind Icardi, planting one flush on the Argentina forward's jaw.

The vicious incident wasn't picked up by referee Mauro Bergonzi, but was captured by television cameras and the 30-year-old midfielder has since been dropped by Italy for a breach of manager Cesare Prandelli's ethical code.

Fiery: De Rossi's conduct went unnoticed but he was handed a retrospective three-game ban

Buffon (Juventus), Perin (Genoa), Sirigu (Paris St Germain); Abate, Astori (Cagliari), Barzagli (Juventus), Bonucci (Juventus), Chiellini (Juventus), Criscito (Zenit), De Sciglio, Maggio (Napoli), Paletta (Parma); Candreva (Lazio), Giaccherini (Sunderland), Marchisio (Juventus), Montolivo (AC Milan), Thiago Motta (PSG), Parolo (Parma), Pirlo (Juventus), Verratti (PSG), Cerci (Torino), Destro (Roma), Gilardino (Genoa), Immobile (Torino), Insigne (Napoli), Osvaldo (Juventus)

Roma talisman De Rossi's problems worsened as he was handed a retrospective three-game ban, after the Lega deemed the punch to be 'deliberate'.

The sanction, which rules De Rossi out of crunch clashes against Napoli, Udinese and Chievo, is likely to hinder Roma's chances of catching leaders Juventus, who hold an 11-point lead at the top after beating Milan 2-0 on Sunday.

Remarkably, De Rossi's wasn't the only punching incident during the heated goalless draw. Inter's Juan Jesus was also handed a three-game domestic ban for punching Roma counterpart Alessio Romagnoli.
