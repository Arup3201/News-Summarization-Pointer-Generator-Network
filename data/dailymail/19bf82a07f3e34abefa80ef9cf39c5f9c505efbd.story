As the daughter of British musician Phil Collins and his second wife, American Jill Tavelman, actress Lily Collins boasts an impressive heritage when it comes to living life in the spotlight.

But the 25-year-old actress, who will next be seen on the big screen starring in romantic comedy Love, Rosie, due for release in the US on February 6, has admitted that she feels as though she has inherited 'two polar opposites' when it comes to her parents diverse personality traits and their unique takes on style.

'It's so polar opposite, but that's me,' Lily explained to Yahoo Style. 'I have these two different histories.'

Polar opposites: Lily Collins, 25, was born in Britain, but moved to Los Angeles at the age of five, following her parents' divorce

Lily Collins is a wonder in white in her latest fashion shoot for Yahoo Style. The actress made quite an impression in this flowing Adam Lippes racerback crepe gown.

The great news is that it's available for pre-order today from Neiman Marcus (click right). At $1695.00, we've seen gowns priced for far worse.

That said, you can still get the look for less so check out our edit of the best white maxis on the market (below). We love Miguelina's version with its crochet-paneling as well as the illusion hem on the version from Lovers + Friends.

Both Three Dots and Splendid created cozy cotton takes on the classic, which does make things a bit more casual but more wearable (and washable) too!

A look like this can be dressed up or down but our favorite way to wear it is with simple gladiator flats for that Grecian goddess feel.

Out on her own: While appearing in a shoot for Yahoo Style, the Love, Rosie star admitted that she refused to use her father's fame in order to advance her own career

While posing in a series of beautifully ethereal images for the online fashion publication, Lily also confessed that, when it comes to shopping, her parents have completely different takes on what makes for the perfect trip.

'I remember [my dad and I] used to go to Abercrombie and Fitch together,' she revealed. 'We'd have Abercrombie shopping trips together — go figure.'

But while her father enjoyed sharing with her his love of simple main street designs, Lily's mother Jill, with whom she moved to Los Angeles following her parents divorce, passed on a love of vintage fashion finds, making sure to introduce her daughter to some of the world's best-loved brands.

'When I was growing up, I was really into vintage,' Lily added. '[My mom] has all the vintage Vivienne Westwood and all these cool pieces that are so hard to find.'

When it comes to her acting career however, Lily was determined to go it alone - without the help of her famous father's name, or his influence.

Family affair: Despite their divorce, Lily's parents, musician Phil Collins and antiques dealer Jill Tavelman (pictured with Lily on her 23rd birthday), appear to be on good terms

The screen star, whose big break came in the form of a supporting role in 2009 big screen hit The Blind Side, in which she appeared alongside Oscar winner Sandra Bullock, admitted that she used to drive herself to any auditions or meetings that she needed to attend - and made sure never to mention any details about her father's profession.

When it came to preparing for her most recently role however - playing a pregnant teenager in British-based romantic comedy Love, Rosie - Lily was ready to re-embrace the English accent that she lost all those years ago.

And as for portraying the emotional aspects of her character's unexpected pregnancy, Lily couldn't have been happier with how the film detailed the journey. 

'Rosie is very real, and she's someone who is forced to grow up very quickly,' she reflected. 

'She is a very strong, empowered young female. I found that really inspiring because it was showing this teenage pregnancy in a way that was very uplifting as opposed to negative.'
