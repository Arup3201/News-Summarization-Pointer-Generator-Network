Jason Roy smashed a stunning century to set England Lions on course to take a 2-0 lead in their one-day series against South Africa A, although they were given a fright by the home opener Reeza Hendricks.

Roy, who had top-scored in the low-scoring opening match in Bloemfontein with 43, piled into the South Africa A bowlers on a Kimberley pitch which justified its reputation as a batsmen's paradise, hitting 13 fours and six sixes after the Lions had been put in.

The Surrey opener made 141, his first Lions century and his highest score in 50-over cricket, from only 110 balls before he was dismissed in the 40th over, ending a second-wicket stand of 198 in 26 overs with his captain James Vince.

Vince fell agonisingly short of his second century of the tour six overs later, adjudged lbw for 99 from 95 balls, and although wickets tumbled late in the innings, Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes maintained the momentum for an imposing total of 376 for nine.

There seemed a real danger that would not be enough as Hendricks and Dean Elgar responded with an opening stand of 142 inside 18 overs under the Diamond Oval floodlights.

It was Lancashire left-arm spinner Stephen Parry, making his first appearance of the tour, who dragged the Lions back into the match with a tidy spell which earned him the wickets of Elgar, for 66 from 59 balls, and Dane Vilas.

Liam Plunkett then claimed one wicket and Mark Wood a couple, but it was Stokes who finally removed Hendricks, driving to cover in the 37th over after making 141, the same score as Roy, from four balls fewer with 14 fours and five sixes.

Harry Gurney also took two wickets before Plunkett returned to claim the last two and end with three for 73 as South Africa A were dismissed for 306 in the 45th over, but Parry remained comfortably the most economical bowler.

The Lions now have the first of three chances to clinch the series in Potchefstroom on Saturday, when South Africa's World Cup wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock is expected to boost the home team as he looks for match practice after an ankle injury.

Tim Bresnan could come into contention for the Lions, as the Yorkshire all-rounder flew into Johannesburg on Wednesday, and Sam Billings hopes to recover from the nasty illness which ruled him out in Kimberley.
