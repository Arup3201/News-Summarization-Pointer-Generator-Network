This adorable family dog narrowly escaped death after eating cocktail sausages that had been deliberately stuffed with inch-long nails by sadistic animal-haters.

Meggie became the victim of a recent spate of barbaric attacks aimed at dogs, which has seen meaty treats laced with nails and then scattered in the path of unsuspecting pets.

Meggie, an eight-year-old Bernese mountain dog, had to undergo emergency surgery after swallowing the potentially deadly sausages that were left lying in the garden of her home in Elgin, Scotland.

Victim: Family pet Meggie needed life-saving emergency surgery after gobbling down sausages that had been deliberately laced with nails

Narrow escape: The sausages eaten by the Bernese mountain dog in Elgin, Moray, had been spiked with nails, similar to those seen in this mocked-up image

Meggie is thought to have eaten five of the sausages, and another three were found lying in the garden.

The dog was rushed to a vet where X-ray scans revealed 10 inch-long nails in her stomach.

Her owner, a young mother who does not want to be named due to her fear of reprisals, said: 'We are shocked at the level some people go to.

'The sausages must have been planted overnight. There was a gardener in on Thursday trimming the grass so it must have been after that.

'I found three other sausages. She's had five, so there must have been eight or nine in total,' the woman added.

Heartless: Meggie, seen left after undergoing surgery, could have died as a result of the cruel set-up

Cruel: The meaty treats were left in the garden of the home in Elgin, Moray, where Meggie lives with her owner - a young mother who has asked not to be named because she fears reprisals

After undergoing surgery - at a cost of £990 - Meggie was kept at the vets overnight for observation before returning home to Elgin, Moray, where she is recovering from her ordeal.

Police are investigating the incident, which they believe was a deliberate attempt to harm Meggie.

In January horrified dog-walkers spotted around 40 cocktail sausages embedded with nails that had been left lying around a park in Abergavenny, South Wales.

The sausages - some of which had as many as ten inch-long nails inside - were removed before they could cause any harm, but local vets said they would almost certainly have proved fatal should a dog have eaten them.

A spokesman for anti-cruelty group Peta, which offered a £1,000 reward to try and help catch the culprits, said there was 'no way this can be anything other than the intention to kill animals'.

Trusting: The eight-year-old dog is believed to have eaten five of the sausages that were stuffed with nails

A dog-walker who noticed the lethal sausages as he walked his pet in the park said he was aware of previous incidents involving shards of broken glass being inserted into treats.

'I have been extra diligent while out walking my dogs since as I believe it would have caused a slow death in the animal,' the man said at the time.
