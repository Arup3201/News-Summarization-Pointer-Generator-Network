An adorable three-year-old who was filmed copying her dancer mom's routine to a Beyonce song has melted hearts across the world after the video went viral.

Little Heaven King was filmed copying her dancer mother Tianne as she performed her complicated moves to the star's Never Let You Go.

Rather than the professional dancer wowing audiences, the little girl quickly steals the show in the video as she body pops and sashays across the studio.
