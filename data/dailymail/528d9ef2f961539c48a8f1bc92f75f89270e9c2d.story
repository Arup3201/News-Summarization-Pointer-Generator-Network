Bolivia's socialist president romped home to a third term in elections yesterday, dedicating his win to Hugo Chavez, Fidel Castro and all 'anti-capitalist leaders'.

Thousands of people poured onto the streets of La Paz in celebration after Evo Morales declared victory, flocking to the presidential palace to catch a glimpse of Bolivia's first indigenous president.

Exit polls showed the former coca farmer re-elected on more than 60 per cent of the vote, some 40 points ahead of his nearest rival, giving him a strong mandate to expand his left-wing policies.

Morales's Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) was meanwhile on track to win 111 out of 130 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 25 of the 36 seats up for grabs in the Senate, according to the exit polls.

'This is the triumph of the anti-colonialists and anti-imperialists,' boomed Morales, 54, who has aligned himself with Cuba, Venezuela and Iran and has an antagonistic relationship with the U.S. and other rich countries.

'We are going to keep growing and we are going to continue the process of economic liberation.'

To roars of approval, he dedicated victory to Cuban leader Fidel Castro, late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez and all 'anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist' leaders.

Official results were delayed but pollsters Ipsos and Equipos Mori said Morales had triumphed a whopping 40 points ahead of wealthy cement magnate Samuel Doria Medina, his nearest rival.

The win will extend his time in office to 14 years, until January 2020, after Bolivia's Supreme Court ruled last year his first term was exempt re-election limits imposed as part of a new constitution in 2009.

That will make him Bolivia's longest-serving leader consecutively in office, eclipsing 19th century Marshal Andres de Santa Cruz, a founder of the republic in power from 1829-1839.

Known abroad for his anti-imperialist and socialist rhetoric, the 55-year-old coca growers' union leader is popular at home for widely redistributing Bolivia's natural gas and mineral wealth among the masses.

A boom in commodities prices increased export revenues nine-fold and under Morales' watch Bolivia accumulated record international reserves and sold bonds abroad for the first time in nearly a century.

Economic growth has averaged 5 percent annually, well above the regional average, helping the government lift half a million Bolivians out of poverty since Morales took office in 2006.

Political analyst Reymi Ferreira of Gabriel Rene Moreno University in Santa Cruz called Morales's landslide 'a recognition of the government's management and of the fact the opposition never presented a vision for the country.'

But critics claimed he spent tens of millions in government money on his campaign, giving him an unfair advantage, while others accusing him of silencing critical media by letting government allies buy them out.

Posters bearing the slogan 'With Evo, we're doing well' blanketed La Paz on election day, far out-shining the opposition's propaganda, which was conspicuously absent.

Morales has capitalised on his everyman image while consolidating state control over Bolivia's institutions, nationalising key utilities and renegotiating natural gas contracts to secure more profit for the government.

But his success has proved double-edged. Morales has alienated environmentalists and many former indigenous allies by promoting mining - a cornerstone of Bolivia's economic boom - and planning jungle highway that will slice through an indigenous reserve.

And despite Bolivia's economic advancements, it is still South America's poorest country. Nearly one in four Bolivians live on $2 a day, according to the World Bank.

The Associated Press cites analysts as saying Bolivia depends too much on natural resources and is especially susceptible to the current easing in commodities demand from China.

Nevertheless, 'El Evo', as he's affectionately known, is here to stay for at least six more years. In a sign of his broad base of support Morales won eight of Bolivia's nine states, including the former opposition stronghold of Santa Cruz, an agribusiness center in the eastern lowlands where he polled 51 percent, according to Ipsos.

Santa Cruz student Sonia Tika summed up the president's popularity.

'I voted for Evo because he's done good things - built roads, given us computers, food stamps. Everything the people asks for, he gives,' she said.

Some six million people were registered to cast ballots in the presidential and congressional polls in Bolivia, where voting is compulsory.

The economic and political stability Morales has presided over are welcome in Bolivia, which has suffered numerous coups since independence in 1825 and still struggles with deep poverty despite the recent boom.

Morales, a member of the Aymara ethnic group, has also used nationalist, anti-capitalist rhetoric to fire up popular support.

He has argued vociferously against the U.S.-led campaign targeting coca farming, which Washington brands a drug-trafficking activity because of the leaf's use in cocaine.

Peru's former drug czar, Ricardo Soberon, estimates the annual revenues of Bolivia's coca farming industry at $2.3billion, equal to about 7 per cent of gross domestic product.

Many Bolivians chew coca leaves or brew them as a tea, and Morales has argued it is part of the country's cultural heritage.

But the U.S. considers Bolivia uncooperative in its war on drugs. In 2008, Morales kicked the US Drug Enforcement Agency out of the country, along with the American ambassador, accusing them of conspiring against his government.

Last year he threw out the U.S. Agency for International Development.
