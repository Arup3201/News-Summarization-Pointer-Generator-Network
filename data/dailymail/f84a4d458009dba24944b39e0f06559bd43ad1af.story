The man accused of beating his four-year-old stepson to death sent a number of disturbing text messages to his wife - and mother of the boy - about 'breaking his ego' and referring to him as a 'pit bull'.

A preliminary hearing is underway for Nathan Sloop, 34. He and his wife Stephanie, 30, are accused in the shocking and brutal murder of her son Ethan Stacy, whose body was found in a shallow grave in the mountains on May 11, 2010.

His face was beaten beyond recognition with a hammer, his body was burned and dog food was sprinkled over him.

Innocent: Officials said Ethan suffered about 10 days worth of severe abuse, including starvation, burning and beatings

'I told you we had a pit bull on our hands, but they learn,' Sloop messaged Stephanie on May 3, 2010.

'Just like Mommy LOL,' she replied.

'I told you we had to break his ego,' Sloop texted.

Then on May 5 she wrote: 'He is broke that's for sure.'

Sloop replied they 'had to figure out how to keep him in his room'.

Both face capital murder and other charges in the boy's death.

Prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty against Sloop.

In addition to capital murder, the 
defendant also faces charges of obstructing justice and intentionally 
inflicting serious injury on a child, and desecration of a dead body, Desert News reported.

In court yesterday, prosecutor David 
Cole said it was Sloops' 'reckless indifference to human life' that 
caused the boy's death.

He said Ethan was scalded, beaten, over-medicated and not given the medical care that he needed.

Nathan Sloop wasn't on the stand yesterday, but his own words were read and played in court from recorded phone calls, taped police interviews and transcripts of interviews, according to Deseret News.

The defense argues the boy was given too much Benadryl, Tylenol and decongestant and died from dehydration.

The court heard tapes wherein Sloop told police he would slap the child, make him stand with his nose against the wall and once pushed him into scalding water.

He also described a time when both he and Stephanie put feces into his mouth and said they never took him to hospital when he was sick.

'(Ethan) had seen things and heard things that a four-year-old boy should never see or hear,' he said.

The court also heard a jail-house phone call to his mother when Sloop called Ethan 'poison' that sunk his relationship with Stephanie Sloop 'like a battleship'.

He also said the boy was disobedient and misbehaved, often sneaking from his room and turning on video games or going to the refrigerator.

Layton Police Sgt Jeff Roderick reported that there were traces of blood found on the wall of Ethan's room, believed to be from the boy's nose rubbing against the wall.

In a short video shown to the court, Ethan can be seen looking dishevelled with some redness on his cheek. He says to the camera: 'I'm having fun with Nathan. He's not scary anymore.'

In an audio recording also played in court, Nathan Sloop can be heard asking Ethan numerous times whether he wanted to stay in Utah or return to live with his father in Virginia. He repeatedly asked the boy if his father was mean or hurt him.

'Where do you want to live?' Sloop asked.

Through tears and wheezing, Ethan croaks back: 'My mom, my mom, my mom.'

Sloop pleaded not guilty to the charges last year. Asked if they would consider a plea deal, Sloop's attorney, Richard Mauro, said that they are just preparing for the preliminary hearings and waiting to see what the prosecution presents as evidence.

Mauro said he plans to challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty as part of a series of motions he'll file.

Sloop's wife, Stephanie Sloop, 30, faces identical charges for contributing to her son's death or failing to stop it, but it remains unknown whether or not the prosecutors will seek the death penalty for her. She is due back in court April12.

Authorities say the boy was beaten, malnourished and left behind one day as the couple left to exchange wedding vows.

Ethan Stacy died 10 days after his arrival to Utah from his birth father's home across country. The birth father, Joe G. Stacy, of Tazewell, Virginia, has said he was forced to give up Ethan during the summer as part of a divorce and custody battle.

Nathanael and Stephanie Sloop initially reported the boy missing, before confessing to police that they had buried his body near a ski resort.

Sloop told police he took the hammer to the boy's face so that he wouldn't be recognizable.

No trial date has been set. Attorneys on both sides declined to speculate about when that could occur.

According to authorities, four-year-old Ethan arrived in Utah in late April 2010 to spend time with his biological mother and her then-fiance.

Court documents cited by The Salt Lake Tribune show that between April 29 and May 8, 2010, the toddler had been subjected to 'severe abuse,' which included beatings, burning, drugging, isolating, starving and refusing to seek medical attention.

Heart-breaking: The Sloops allegedly left the little boy beaten and locked up at home while they went to get married in May 2010

Investigators say that on the day of Nathan and Stephanie Sloop's wedding May 6, the child was locked in an apartment bedroom on his own because the couple feared people would call police if they saw the toddler's injuries.

Following her arrest, Stephanie Sloop told police that on May 7, 2010, she got a call from her husband saying that her son had burned himself while taking a bath, according to CBS News.

When the mother reached home, probable cause documents state she found Ethan with severe burns to his feet and along the back of his legs. She also noticed what she described as human feces in the four-year-old's mouth.

Mrs Sloop told police that she did not seek medical help for her injured son because she was afraid that Nathan Sloop would harm her if she tried to do so.

On Mother's Day, May 10, 2010, Stephanie and Nathan Sloop reported the boy missing after discovering that Ethan had died, according to prosecutors. The Sloops told police that the toddler wandered out of the apartment in Layton.

However, the following evening, the child's remains were discovered wrapped in plastic and dumped in a shallow grave near Powder Mountain in Weber County.

The four-year-old's face was severely disfigured, and there was dog food sprinkled on his grave.
