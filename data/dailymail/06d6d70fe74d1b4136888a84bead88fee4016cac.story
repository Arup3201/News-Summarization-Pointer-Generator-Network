Michael Oliver has been handed the Manchester derby on Sunday - just months after missing Marouane Fellaini's flailing elbow on Pablo Zabaleta.

The Belgian flung an arm in the Manchester City defender's direction during United's defeat at Old Trafford, but was given a reprieve and stayed on the pitch. 

The 29-year-old Oliver is, however, one of the best referees in the Premier League and this appointment reflects that.

HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box.

Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating.

And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League.

For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that.

So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees.

We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it.

The Premier League have leaned on the youngster for some of its bigger fixtures over the last 12 months.

And this weekend is no different; Oliver will lead the teams out at the Etihad Stadium. 

He will look to avoid being in the spotlight for missing an incident this time.

He was also criticised by Sportsmail's Graham Poll in the aftermath of Chelsea's win at Burnley in August after wrongfully cautioning Diego Costa for simulation when the striker had been tripped by goalkeeper Tom Heaton. 

Oliver also booked Nacer Chadli for cupping his ear to the home Arsenal supporting during Tottenham's 1-1 draw at the Emirates Stadium last month. 

And during Swansea's recent match at Stoke he correctly gave a penalty to the visitors for Ryan Shawcross wrestling down Wilfried Bony in the area. 

Oliver has been talked about as a potential official during the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

Phil Dowd was pilloried for failing to spot serious penalty box grappling by Marcos Rojo and Chris Smalling on Branislav Ivanovic and John Terry during United's draw against Chelsea on Sunday.

And Dowd has been given the Monday night game between Crystal Palace and Sunderland at Selhurst Park. 

Meanwhile, Mike Jones will take charge of the west London derby between Chelsea and QPR, with Andre Marriner overseeing Liverpool's trip to Newcastle.
