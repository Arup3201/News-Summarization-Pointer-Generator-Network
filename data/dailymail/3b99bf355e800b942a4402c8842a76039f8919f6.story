The headteacher of a school for excluded pupils repeatedly punched a colleague in a drunken row outside a train station, a court heard today.

Katrina Mann, 48, was seen ‘kissing and embracing’ fellow teacher Darren McCarthy, 38, before their late-night clash at Barking station, Essex.

Witnesses called the police as the couple shouted and swore at each other at 11.45pm, Havering Magistrates’ Court heard.

Mann, the headteacher of Barking and Dagenham Tuition Centre, McCarthy yelled at officers, screaming ‘why are you f***ing stopping me’.

Mann then told McCarthy to ‘shut the f*** up, you p****, don’t say anything - you’re coming home with me.’

She added that she was ‘the head of a centre for excluded children and you don’t know what it’s like dealing with their behaviour.’

Roy Baxendall, the presiding magistrate, said today: ‘The behaviour that went on was totally unacceptable, particularly in the light of the jobs you do and the vulnerable people you are dealing with.

‘You completely lost it and completely showed yourselves up. Had your mitigation not been so strongly put you would each be facing very serious levels of fines.’

CCTV images showed the pair in the train station, where McCarthy was seen standing with his hands outstretched and shouting before aiming a blow towards Mann’s head.

Both were then seen punching each other in the head, prompting a second member of the public to call the police.

Officers arrived to find McCarthy ‘shouting and aggressive,’ claiming they were only stopping him because he was a ‘n*****.’

More blows were exchanged between the pair, Mann punching McCarthy three times before they were arrested on suspicion of drunk and disorderly behaviour.

At the station, Mann said they had been drinking Stella lager at the nearby Barking Dog pub since 5.30pm and she had been too drunk to remember leaving or what had happened next.

She added that she saw McCarthy as a ‘work colleague.’

He said he was not drunk and had been angry with police, who he felt had been racist and made him miss the last train home to Walthamstow, east London.

The pair, who have been suspended from their jobs at Barking and Dagenham Tuition Centre, denied charges of being drunk and disorderly in a public place and using threatening words and behaviour.

But they admitted lesser charges of using disorderly words and behaviour before a planned trial this morning.

They were each handed a conditional discharge for 12 months and ordered to pay £85 court costs.

Donal Lawler, defending Mann, said the mother-of-four had been upset because her daughter's then-partner had assaulted her daughter.

He was due to be sentenced on domestic abuse charges at Redbridge Magistrates’ Court today.

Mr Lawler added: ‘Miss Mann has already paid a very high price for this because she is currently suspended from her job.

‘She is a lead teacher at a pupil referral centre that pupils are sent to when they are excluded from other schools.

‘It is the most problematic and the most challenging pupils. It is a very, very challenging job and one she does well - the school has had very good Ofsted reports.’

Andrew Lock, defending McCarthy, said the father-of-two was still angry with police about how he had been treated.

The pair refused to comment about the incident, but a friend of theirs said:

‘It’s all been blown out of proportion and as a result the school is having to operate without two dedicated members of staff.’

The Barking and Dagenham Tuition Centre has been praised by Ofsted for being ‘extremely successful’ at getting previously disaffected students back into education.

The vast majority of its 226 11- to 16 year-olds have histories of poor attendance at mainstream schools. All have special educational needs, including social, emotional and behavioural difficulties.

The centre also offers the borough’s nine secondary schools respite places for pupils at risk of permanent exclusion.

A spokesman for Barking and Dagenham council said: ‘Ms Mann and Mr McCarthy are both on special leave pending court appearances and disciplinary investigation.’

Mann, of Hornchurch, Essex, and McCarthy, of Walthamstow, east London, admitted using disorderly words and behaviour during the incident on January 26.
