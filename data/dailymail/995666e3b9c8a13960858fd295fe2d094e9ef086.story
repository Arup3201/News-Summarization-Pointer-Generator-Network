Italy and France need to work 'harder and faster' to resolve their structural problems, a senior ally of German chancellor Angela Merkel said today.

Michael Meister, a key figure in Merkel's Christian Democrats, said: 'Italy and France have structural problems to resolve and not economic problems.

'They can't wait any longer. More time won't relieve the problem. It'll only make it worse.'

However, French president Francois Hollande warned that the EU's austerity policy was threatening the continent's stability and could even see Europe 'wiped out from the world map'.

Figures yesterday showed France has plunged back into recession exactly a year after Hollande took office, piling more 
misery on the beleaguered socialist leader.

Italian government bond yields have also fallen in recent months while the eurozone is suffering its longest ever downturn.

The French economic collapse, confirmed last night, means that nine of the 17 eurozone countries are now in recession.

Mr Hollande told a news conference in 
Paris that the financial crisis is now 'behind us', but predicted that 
widespread austerity measures could push the continent into a fresh 
disaster.

'What is hitting Europe is a recession provoked by the austerity policy,' he said.

'If Europe does not advance it will 
fall or even be wiped out from the world map - my duty is to bring 
Europe out of its lethargy.'

Mr Meister said the European Central Bank should 
stop buying Italian government debt if Italy failed to meet its debt 
reduction requirements

The value of Italian bonds has fallen as investors put their faith in the 
ECB's ability to prevent indecisive elections earlier this year driving 
Italy into full-blown crisis. 

But Mr Meister's comments to the Neue
 Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper also come just as Germany's campaign for
 the September election gets into full swing.

He said Italy urgently needed to work on improving its competitiveness and consolidating its budget.

'That's the job of national political
 leaders and not the ECB,' he said. He added the new Italian government 
was capable of taking the necessary action and the country has a 
relatively strong industry.

'Italy can do it on its own strength,' he said.

Meanwhile figures showed that France, the single currency’s second largest economy, saw its output shrink by 0.2 per cent in the first three months of the year.

As
 it shrank by the same amount in the final three months of 2012, it 
means France has experienced a double-dip recession – after the economy 
contracted in 2009 when the banking crisis sparked the deepest global 
slump since the Second World War

Mr Hollande is the most unpopular 
president in French history, according to opinion polls. He has often 
been criticised for his handling of the economy, ridiculed for 
attempting and failing to introduce a 75 per cent tax on the wealthiest,
 and lampooned for his personal life and his relationship with partner 
Valerie Trierweiler.

Under the tenure of the tax-and-spend 
Left-winger, the country has seen unemployment soar and business 
confidence drop. Unemployment in France has reached 3.22 million, or 
10.6 per cent, the worst since 1997. Youth unemployment is  25.4 per 
cent.

Under Mr Hollande, the French economy 
has failed to grow at all. In contrast, the UK avoided re-entering 
recession – two consecutive quarters of decline. Our economy grew by 0.3
 per cent between January and March.

European Commission President Jose 
Manuel Barroso urged Mr Hollande to proceed faster with economic reforms
 in return for being granted two more years to bring its budget deficit 
below the EU limit.

France had to make up for 20 years of lost competitiveness and reduce ‘the exorbitant weight of debt’ on its economy, he said.

French finance minister Pierre 
Moscovici blamed the decline on the moribund economies of the countries 
around it. He said: ‘We are in Europe, the eurozone countries are our 
main clients and our main suppliers, and when the environment around us 
is depressed, well, that’s the main factor in the slowing of the French 
economy.’

The bad news for the French economy 
came as the recession across the 17-nation eurozone – of which Britain 
is not a member – entered its sixth consecutive quarter, falling 0.2 per
 cent.

The euro bloc has been in recession 
since the end of 2011, but this is the first time that the economic 
malaise has spread to the core nations, France and Germany.

Germany, the largest economy, narrowly
 avoided entering recession after its economy grew 0.1 per cent, up from
 a decline of 0.7 per cent last quarter. Portugal, Spain and Italy, 
officially remain in recession, with Ireland, Malta and debt-hit 
Slovenia still to report on the last quarter. The economies of all three
 shrank at the end of 2012.

Unemployment across the eurozone is at
 a record high of 12.1 per cent, and in countries such as Greece is as 
high as 27.2 per cent.
