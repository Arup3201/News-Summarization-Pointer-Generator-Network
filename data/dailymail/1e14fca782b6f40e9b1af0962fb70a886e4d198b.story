Towns and cities across Britain are drowning under mountainous piles of Christmas and New Year rubbish as some homes have not had refuse collections for up to three weeks.

Bins are overflowing and streets strewn with boxes and black bags in a situation householders say is posing a health risk.

Photographs taken today show roads in Bristol, Birmingham and Edinburgh all submerged in rubbish, strengthening the Government's argument that every home in Britain should have its waste collected weekly.

Birmingham: Some homes in this city have not had refuse collections for three weeks

Bristol: Detritus is piled outside some homes in the city in an image mirrored all over Britain

Councils have today been accused of being irresponsible as some cancelled collections over Christmas and the New Year to give their staff time off.

As a result, to rectify the current chaotic situation, some have had to put on emergency collections to placate hopping-mad households.

Furious residents living in the Harborne area of Birminham  - where house prices top £400,000 - expressed dismay as their bins have not been collected since December 16.

While residents living in well-heeled Carless Avenue, accused Birmingham City Council of abandoning frontline services.

One homeowner said: 'It's shocking, really, you open your door and you're met with this sea of waste.

'It's really starting to smell a bit and I worry that the longer it's left there the more of a risk it will pose to families and their children.

'I appreciate that everyone needs some time off over Christmas but I don't know many people that get a three-week break.

'The council should have foreseen the inevitable problems of cancelling collections over Christmas when, traditionally, households accumulate even more rubbish.'

Stinky: Food, card and paper are left waiting for collection on this Bristol street

One large semi-detached house could not be seen at all from the road as black bin bags were piled high on the clipped grass verges.

Meanwhile residents in nearby Bordesley Green battled their way through ankle-deep filth yesterday after strong winds caused dozens of bin bags to split, sending waste spilling across the pavement.

The situation became so bad over Christmas that the council had to make an emergency collection due to the volume of complaints from locals.

Pile: Edinburgh is still recovering from its busy and legendary Christmas and New Year celebrations

Pensioner Pat Clarke, 68, said that the build-up of refuse has created a health hazard for her and other older residents.

She said: 'I'm registered disabled and on crutches so it's a real nightmare when I go out there.

'There are lots of polythene bottles and if they get wet they become very slippery and if I accidentally put my crutch on one that's it and I go over.

'We haven't had any notification from the council about the changes - in previous years I've had a note through the door but I got nothing this year.

'I only knew they were coming when a neighbour phoned me to let me know.'

A Birmingham City Council spokesperson
said: 'As is the case every year, there are some planned changes to the
refuse collection service over Christmas and New Year.

'This year there were no collections 
scheduled on Christmas Day or Boxing Day, and this was widely publicised
well in advance of the festive period.

'Household collections continue as normal on all other days, including New Year's Day.

'Anyone
with an urgent need to dispose of waste before their next scheduled 
collection can visit any of the city's five Household Recycling 
Centres.'

Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles says a voluntary scheme has ‘stopped the rot’ and prevented more councils switching to hugely unpopular fortnightly schemes.

But he threatened to go further - suggesting central Government grants to local authorities will be slashed in the long-term for those that refuse to bring back the weekly bin round.

At least half the homes in Britain - 10million households covered by 180 local authorities - have lost their weekly collections and now have general rubbish taken away only once every two weeks.

Residents have been 'shocked' that the council did not provide a Christmas rubbish collection

The politician said in his vow to bring back weekly collections: 'I believe it’s a fundamental right for every Englishman and woman to be able to put the remnants of their chicken tikka masala in their bin without having to wait two weeks for it to be collected.'

Once-a-week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875 to stamp out cholera and other plagues which claimed huge numbers of lives.

They were maintained until after Labour’s 1997 election victory, when local authorities were encouraged to collect household waste and recyclable rubbish on alternate weeks.
