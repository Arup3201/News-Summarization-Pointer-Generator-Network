Geraldine 'Jerrie' Mock, the Ohio housewife who 50 years ago became the first female pilot to fly solo around the world, has died. She was 88.

Mock died in her sleep Tuesday at her home in Quincy, Florida, after being in failing health for months, her grandson, Chris Flocken, said Wednesday.

Mock flew her single-engine Cessna 180 'Spirit of Columbus' 23,000 miles in 29-plus days before landing in Ohio's capital city on April 17, 1964 - 27 years after Amelia Earhart's much more famous - albeit unsuccessful - attempt to circle the globe.

Dubbed 'the flying housewife' at the time, the Newark, Ohio, native was a mother of three in suburban Columbus but also an experienced pilot who studied aeronautical engineering at Ohio State University. 

She spent months planning her flight with aviation experts and veteran pilots.

U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson presented Mock with the Federal Aviation Administration's Exceptional Service decoration in 1964.

Despite the number of records Mock broke, few people knew of the flight or its historical significance,

A life-sized bronze statue depicting Mock holding a globe was unveiled in April at Port Columbus airport on the 50th anniversary of her flight. 

Her plane, the 'Spirit of Columbus,' was put on display at the National Air and Space Museum in 1976.

She was unable, due to health reasons, to attend the events, but recounted her adventure in an April interview, saying she was inspired as a child by aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart. 

Earhart was trying to become the first female aviator to circle the globe when she and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared in the South Pacific in 1937. 

 Mock played down her trip as a fun way to see the world.

'Airplanes are meant to fly. I was completely confident in my plane,' she said.

But she had radio and brake problems, ran into bad weather, and landed by mistake at an Egyptian military base.
