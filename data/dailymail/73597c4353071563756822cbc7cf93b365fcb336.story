Dramatic pictures show the moment the Japanese coast guard rescued a British adventurer who hit a storm while rowing solo across the Pacific.

Miss Outen, from Oakham, 
Leicestershire, was attempting to row from Japan to Canada when her boat
hit a ferocious tropical storm, Typhoon Mawar, 560 miles off the 
Japanese coast.

Another Briton on a similar trek was still awaiting rescue.

Her blog said she was hit by a storm 
during her attempted journey around the world, and that her boat 
repeatedly capsized and was damaged.

Today the Oxford graduate tweeted: 
'Hooray 4 Japanese always being early!' which was followed by an 
announcement that she was safe on the rescue ship.

The coast guard confirmed her rescue 
late Friday afternoon, and said she was walking on her own and appeared 
relatively healthy.

Miss Outen had signaled for help on 
Thursday morning 900 kilometers (560 miles) off Japan's northeastern 
coast, saying there was a hole in her boat and that water was seeping 
in, according to the coast guard.

Another coast guard vessel was headed
to rescue Charlie Martell, who had been on a separate solo trek when he
got caught up in the same storm. His boat, Blossom, was 1,100 
kilometers (680 miles) off the northeastern coast of Japan, the coast 
guard said.

Miss Outen, 27, embarked on her 
planned two-and-a-half year journey in April 2011. She is trying to 
circle the globe using only human power, cycling, rowing and kayaking 
more than 32,000 kilometers (20,000 miles).

Mr Martell said on his website that 
he planned to row "solo and unsupported" across the Pacific. The coast 
guard's ship is expected to reach his boat by tomorrow.

Miss Outen's boat was closer than Mr Martell's, but she likely won't return to shore until Saturday, the coast guard said.
