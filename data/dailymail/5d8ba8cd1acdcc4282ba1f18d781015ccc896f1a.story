Panic attacks: Martha Sangster, a 21-year-old student, had a history of asthma

A university student died from a severe bout of asthma after telling doctors she was having panic attacks over exams and coursework, an inquest heard.

Martha Sangster, 21, was found dead after a severe asthma attack at her student home in Lancaster, where she was studying at the University of Cumbria.

In the months before her death Miss Sangster, who had a history of asthma, had told medics that her impending exams and coursework were giving her anxiety attacks.

She was found on a Monday morning last January after she didn't turn up for lectures that morning.

Tests showed she had hyperinflated lungs - a symptom which suggests she was struggling to breathe at the time of her death.

The inquest in Preston was told Miss Sangster, Bradford, West Yorkshire, had a history of asthma and epilepsy.

She had been prescribed epilepsy drugs and had been given two inhalers to deal with her conditions.

At first Miss Sangster believed her attacks were triggered by exercise, cold weather, cats and hayfever.

But last summer she began experiencing panic attacks and anxiety in the run-up to coursework deadlines and her final exams.

Speaking at the inquest, Dr Juliette McGrattan said Miss Sangster told her she had had an 'odd episode' on holiday in the U.S.

She said: 'She told me she had been sharing a room and her roommate commented that she had acted strangely. She was lying on her side and not responding properly.

'I asked if she thought it was a seizure and she said she didn't think it was a seizure. She thought it was a panic attack.

'I asked if she could be sure and she said if she had a seizure in the past she felt very sick after and hadn't felt nauseous. I remember feeling uncertain and writing to monitor carefully. This was two months after she had the episode and I told her to come back if anything similar occurred.

'I tried to explore it, I said please come back if something like that happens again. I told her she needed to book in an asthma review with the nurse. It is something we struggle with if people think their asthma is well-controlled.

'As far as I'm aware no appointment was booked.'

Another doctor, Anna Kalougin, told the inquest Miss Sangster came to see her last December because she had been panicking about coursework deadlines, and asked for a medical note.

Night out: Friends of Miss Sangster told how a few days before her death they had been partying in Lancaster - but that she seemed fine the day afterwards

She was prescribed an anti-nausea tablet to dissolve under her tongue.

The fatal attack struck after Miss Sangster went on a night out with university friends in Lancaster.

Kathryn Pawson, part of the group that night, told the inquest how they had stayed out until 4am on the Saturday morning and had bought a takeaway on their way back to a friend's house.

Recommendation: One doctor said that she had advised Miss Sangster to book a follow-up appointment about her astham, but that it did not take place

Miss Pawson said: 'She decided that she was going to walk home. We said to stay at the friend's but one of the boys walked her home because she wanted to go home. She was fine, she was quite happy, quite normal, not the worse for drink.

'I rang her about 1.30pm that day to see how she was. I asked how she was and she said about the fact that to say she had been out she wasn't feeling that bad.

'Normally she would say she feels rough and hungover. She said she didn't feel that bad but wanted to just stay in bed and chill and watch films.

'I tried to get in touch on Sunday and sent her a text to see if she was coming over. I didn't get a reply but because we had lectures the next day I thought she would come to mine after.'

The inquest was told it was impossible to determine the exact date of time of her death, which was recorded as Monday, January 13 - when she was found.

The Sangster family believe she had self-diagnosed her panic attacks and feared she had in fact been suffering from epileptic fits.

But coroner Simon Jones recording a verdict of death by natural causes, saying: 'The hyperinflated lungs would be consistent with an acute asthmatic event.'
