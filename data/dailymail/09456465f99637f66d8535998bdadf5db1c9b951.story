Sunderland have completed the signing of former Manchester City goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon.

Black Cats boss Gus Poyet swooped for the 27-year-old Romanian, whose contract was not renewed by City at the end of the season.

Pantilimon said: 'It is a great privilege and honour to join a club like Sunderland.

Ambitious: Pantilimon, who was number two at City, says it was important to join a club moving forward

Return: Pantilimon was in goal for Manchester City when they lost at the Stadium of Light last season

Progress: The Romanian had a run of games when Joe Hart was dropped but now wants to be a number one

'They have an amazing history and tradition and, of course, passionate fans.

'When I left Manchester City it was important that I chose a club with good ambition and a manager who has the hunger and desire to take the team forward.

'After speaking with the boss, I knew this was the right place and he was the right man. I can't wait to start.'
