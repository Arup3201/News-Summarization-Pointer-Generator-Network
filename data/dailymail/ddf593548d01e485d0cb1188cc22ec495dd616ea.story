Daisy Coleman became suicidal after she was allegedly raped at age 14, then tormented by cyber bullies, her mother says

A mother says she was driven from a rural Missouri town and her home mysteriously burned down after her 14-year-old daughter accused a popular football player of rape.

High school freshman Daisy Coleman was subjected to constant cyber-bullying from classmates - and even parents - in Maryville, Missouri, after she reported in January 2012 that she had been raped. She told police the 17-year-old boy invited her to a party where she became so intoxicated she couldn't stand and then had sex with her while a friend filmed the incident on an iPhone.

She told CNN's 'Erin Burnett OutFront' that she and her friend had been drinking and went to his house, where they 'snuck in through his basement window. 'He gave me a big glass of a clear liquid. And that's all I remember,' the teenager said yesterday on CNN.

The athlete and his friends then allegedly dumped Daisy on her front porch, where she passed out - with no shoes or socks and no coat - in 22-degree weather. When her mother found her several hours later, Daisy's hair was frozen and she had frostbite on her hands and feet.

'There was frost on the ground,' Daisy's mother Melinda Coleman told CNN.

'It wasn't until I undressed her to put her in a warm tub that I realised that maybe she had been sexually assaulted. So I asked her if she was hurting, and she said yes, and started to cry,' she said.

The Kansas City Star reports
 that Mrs Coleman, a veterinarian, lost her job as a 
result of the police report her daughter filed. Mrs Coleman says her 
three sons - Daisy's brothers - were threatened at school and booed on 
the field - often by boys they had counted as their friends just weeks 
earlier.

She said she had no
 choice but leave. Town officials and many residents had made it clear 
that she was no longer welcome in the town of 12,000, she said.

'Basically
 I was terrified, I wanted to protect my children, I wanted to get them 
out of there,' she told MailOnline, agreeing that her family's names and photographs be used to highlight their case.

In April, eight months after she left town, Mrs Coleman's house in Maryville - which she was trying to sell - burned down. Fire investigators have ruled the cause 'undetermined,' but Mrs Coleman told MailOnline that she suspects the blaze could be arson - connected with town residents who were furious over her daughter's rape allegations.

'On one hand, it would almost be a comfort to think it was an electrical problem that caused the fire, but on the other other hand, there’s a part of me that really thinks that the fire could be part of all this,' Mrs Coleman said. 

'They threatened me. I’d been threatened and my daughter had been threatened and I lost my job because of threats.'

Mrs Coleman says she moved her family to 
Maryville after her husband, a doctor, died in a car crash in 2006. She 
was hoping for a fresh start for herself and for her children.

Sheriff's deputies arrested two teens within hours and charged them with felonies. A few weeks later, the prosecutor, Robert Rice, dropped the rape charges - citing insufficient evidence. 

Mrs Coleman told MailOnline the torrents of hatred came only days after the case went public.

The backlash on social media was 
vitriolic. Classmates said the Daisy had been 'asking for it' at the party.

A girl showed 
up to one of the teen girl's dance recitals with a shirt alluding to
 the alleged rape. When the charges against her alleged rapist were dismissed, one local 
student wrote to the teen on Twitter, saying, 'F*** yea. That’s what you
 get for bein a skank : )'.

One of Daisy's brothers was booed at his final wrestling match of the 
year. Mrs Coleman says a friend warned her that students were planning 
to beat up her sons in the parking lot of the high school over the 
incident.

Mrs
 Coleman lost her job at the local veterinary clinic. She 
says her boss admitted that she was fired because the case had become 
too contentious.

Veterinarian
 Sally Hayse told the Star: 'This is a small community, and it 
definitely was stressful for us here, without a doubt.

But, she said, 'If you were to ask me point-blank (why Mrs Coleman was fired), I would say it’s because our style of medicine didn’t jive.'

Mrs Coleman said her daughter suffered heavily - both from the alleged assault and from the online abuse. She tried to kill herself twice, including once when her brother found her in the bathroom and took her to the hospital.

'She had a really hard time. She went through a period, a really dark time. She did the self-mutilation and the anger,' Mrs Coleman told MailOnline.

'So much of being told it was her fault ... it really does seem like it’s your fault when people keep saying it over and over again.'

But, Daisy, now 16, is recovering, her mother says. After intensive therapy, she is beginning to move past the trauma of the alleged attack.
