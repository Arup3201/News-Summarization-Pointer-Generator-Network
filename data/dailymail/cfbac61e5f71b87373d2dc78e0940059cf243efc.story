A man wearing an Afghan National Army uniform opened fire on NATO troops in eastern Afghanistan, killing one, officials said.

A local police chief in Kunar province said the soldier was an American, but NATO's International Security Assistance Force did not say which country the deceased soldier was from.

Today's shooting brings the death toll to 20 NATO soldiers who have been killed by Afghan colleagues in at least 15 separate attacks so far this year.

There are unconfirmed reports that two other soldiers were also killed during the shooting.

'An Afghan army soldier turned his weapon against US soldiers inside an Afghan-US military base in Kunar province, killing one US soldier and injuring two others,' said provincial police chief Ewaz Mohammad Naziri.

The attack took place early Friday and the gunman managed to flee the scene, Naziri said.

The Taliban claimed the attacker was 
part of the Taliban and had infiltrated in order to attack foreign 
soldiers.

NATO confirmed there had been an 
attack in Kunar Province killing one soldier but did not disclose that 
soldierâ€™s nationality, or give any other details beyond saying it was 
investigating the case.

In
a separate statement, NATO said a second coalition soldier had died 
Friday, this time in an insurgent attack in southern Afghanistan, but it
gave no more details.

The shooting comes just four days after three coalition troops were killed by an improvised explosive device (IED) in eastern Afghanistan.

Last Thursday the Taliban announced the start of its 'spring offensive.'

Seven Afghans, many of them children, were killed after a large bomb exploded in Kabul last week, with the Taliban claiming responsibility.
