Nearly two million Catalans voted in favour of splitting from Spain in a symbolic referendum held on Sunday.

Supporters hope that the result, which has so far seen 80 per cent vote in favour of an independent Catalonia, will see a binding ballot on the issue.

However, only 40 per cent of eligible voters have turned up to vote, which could in part explain the high number of pro-independence votes.

Around 2.23million out of 5.4million potential voters have so far cast their ballot in the informal referendum, a number which may increase as the vote will formally remain open for another two weeks.

In the booth, Catalans are being asked two questions: whether they wanted Catalonia to be a state and whether this state should become independent from Spain.

While the vote will formally remain open for another two weeks, the regional government said on Monday 80.7 percent had until now answered 'yes' to the two questions, with 10.1 percent voting 'yes' and 'no' and 4.5 percent voting a double 'no'.

'We have earned the right to a referendum,' the regional government head Artur Mas told cheering supporters. He deemed the vote a historic success, setting the stage for a full referendum.

'Once again Catalonia has shown that it wants to rule itself.'

Rafael Catala, Spain's Justice Minister, accused Mas of organizing 'an act of pure political propaganda with no democratic validity. A sterile and useless event.' He said the government might take further legal measures against the vote.

Polls show that the majority of Catalonia's 7.5 million inhabitants want an official vote on independence while around half support breaking centuries-old ties with Spain. 

There was a festive atmosphere as hundreds lined up in front of another school in Barcelona, with some wearing pro-independence regalia.

'I voted for independence because I've always felt very Catalan,' said Nuria Silvestre, a 44-year-old teacher. 'Maybe I wasn't so radical before, but the fact that they are prohibiting (the vote) from Madrid has made me.'

Catalan TV showed similar lines of voters across the region.  

In response to the informal vote, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy urged the region to return to 'sanity' and for talks 'within the legal framework of the constitution'.

He said the vote would be 'neither a referendum nor a consultation nor anything of the sort'.

He added: 'What is certain is that it will not have any effect..

Spanish state prosecutors have announced they will open an investigation to determine if by holding the informal vote in defiance of the court's suspension the Catalan government has broken the law.

Catalonia has seen rallies of hundreds of thousands of pro-independence supporters for the past three years. 

It is a wealthy region of 7.5 million people and contributes more to the Spanish economy than it gets back through central government funds. Economic and cultural grievances have fuelled Catalan nationalism.

Catalonia's push for independence comes two months after Scots voted to remain in the United Kingdom. 

Mr Mas said after the defeat of the 'Yes' campaign: 'This is a powerful and strong message that the UK is sending to the entire world - that if there is such a conflict elsewhere in the world, you have the right way to try to resolve these differences,' 

'So it is not a setback, it is a very positive message for us and should be for the central institutions in Madrid.'
