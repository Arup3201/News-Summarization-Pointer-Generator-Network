A fire broke out tonight at a £500-a-night Mayfair hotel which has previously housed the likes of David Beckham and Rihanna.

The London Fire Brigade sent six fire engines and 35 firefighters and officers to the scene outside the Metropolitan Hotel, above Nobu restaurant on Old Park Lane, after being called at about 5pm.

The blaze - which began in scaffolding outside the hotel - saw 300 guests and staff evacuated, and caught the attention of dozens of passers-by who stopped to take photographs.

It was brought under control by 6.30pm. Everyone who was inside the hotel – which has room rates from £309 to £518 today - is safe, and firefighters were tonight carrying out salvage work inside.

Station manager Clive Robinson, who was at the scene, said: 'The fire was affecting a working platform on the first floor level of scaffolding. 

'A small amount of the external fascia was damaged by fire. Around 180 residents and 120 members of staff evacuated before the arrival of the brigade. 

'Fortunately there were no injuries. Firefighters will remain at the scene carrying out salvage work inside the property on the ground and first floor.'

Crews from Lambeth, Chelsea, Soho and Euston fire stations attended the incident. An LFB spokesman said the brigade was called at 5.12pm and that the fire’s cause was not yet clear.

A hotel spokesman said: 'To confirm, a small fire on the outside of the building broke out. All guests and staff are safe. Thank you to London Fire Brigade and Westminster police for acting so quickly.’

And a spokesman for Nobu London said tonight: 'Earlier this evening, a fire broke out on scaffolding at the Metropolitan Hotel, one level above Nobu London. 

'The exterior suffered minimal damage and no one was hurt. Nobu London closed for dinner service and redirected all bookings to Nobu Berkeley ST. They expect to trade tomorrow at lunchtime.'

Previous guests at the hotel - which was profiled by the Mail five years ago  - include Bruce Willis, Victoria Beckham, fashion designer Giorgio Armani, Cameron Diaz and the Killers.

Three-quarters of the 150 rooms look out on to Hyde Park. It is part of a small chain of hotels from Christina Ong, who also owns the Parrot Cay resort in the Caribbean.
