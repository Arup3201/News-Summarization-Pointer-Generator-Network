Virgin Galactic was operating short of safety standards that allow for crew members to survive two separate and unrelated failures, a safety expert has claimed.

Considered best-practice within the industry, the system known as 'two failure tolerance' is designed to allow for survival if there are two unrelated problems on an aircraft.

But Tommaso Sgobba, the former head of fight safety for the European Space Agency, said Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo had too few  safeguards in place to prevent an accident he believes was 'waiting to happen'.

The experimental space craft disintegrated over the California desert a week ago when its feathering system deployed prematurely and aerodynamic forces  tore it apart.

Co-pilot Michael Alsbury was killed in the accident pilot Peter Siebold was seriously injured.

Feathering systems, which involve rotating the craft's tail structure, give it the ability to slow down and float like a feather, but are deadly if deployed at the wrong time.

Mr Sgobba has now told the Financial Times SpaceShipTwo's feathering system appeared to be 'one failure tolerant', meaning it could withstand one, not two, problems.

Investigators claim the feathering system activated when a lever was mistakenly pulled to unlock it - even though it should require a second lever to be pulled to deploy it, the paper reported.

Virgin Galactic responded to the claims by saying the feathering locking mechanism used two safeguards - one procedural and one mechanical.

In the wake of the disaster, Mr Sgobba has been highly critical of Branson's attempt to pioneer private space travel and claims the company worked in secrecy.

He said: ‘They operated in secrecy, which is difficult to understand.

'They don’t use modern techniques in putting safety into the design. I have been saying for some years now this was an accident waiting to happen.'

The fatal accident has also prompted a review of insurance for  adventure trips into space such as those advertised by Richard Branson's company.

A loophole means adventure travelers hoping to head into space - unlike pilots and skydivers - don't have to take out extra life insurance.

The loophole exists because US life insurance policies don't ask about space tourism or exclude it from coverage, meaning insurers most likely would have to pay if the holder died on a space trip, insurance industry veterans said. 

Insurance companies say they are considering what to do about space tourists after the Virgin crash,and the loophole is likely to be slowly closed.
