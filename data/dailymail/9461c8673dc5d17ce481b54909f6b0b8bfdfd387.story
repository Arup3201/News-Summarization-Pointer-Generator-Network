The elderly parents of a teacher who went missing with her daughter two years ago following a court battle with her former partner could be jailed for refusing to reveal where she is hiding.

A High Court judge ruled that Brian and Patricia Davies, both in their 70s, and the couple's other daughter Melanie Williams, were in contempt of court after not revealing all they knew about Jacqueline Davies, 49, and daughter Alice's disappearance.

Ms Davies and five-year-old Alice are believed to have travelled to Russia after a family court ruled that her former partner Julian Brown, should have contact with his daughter.

The pair had become involved in a court wrangle after separating.

Following Mr Justice Keehan's verdict at the family division of the High Court yesterday, Mr Brown urged his former partner to 'come to her senses' and return to the UK.

The 49-year-old gas engineer from Hampshire, said: 'I just want her to come to her senses and come back.

'I'm not asking for blood. I just want to see my daughter every other weekend.'

He added: 'I don't want her parents and sister to be jailed. I hope she sees reason.'

Ms Davies' parents and sister will be sentenced on Wednesday and have been remanded in custody until then.

Mr Justice Keenan said that it is unclear whether Ms Davies is still in Russia, where she is thought to have fled to.

He said Alice's grandparents and aunt,
who has two children, had been told to provide the court with any 
information they had about the little girl's whereabouts.

And he concluded - after hearing all three give evidence - that they had not complied and were in contempt.
