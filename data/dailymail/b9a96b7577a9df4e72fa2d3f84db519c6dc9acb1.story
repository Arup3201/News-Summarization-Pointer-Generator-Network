Rory McIlroy promised to take nothing for granted after opening an enormous six-shot lead with another brilliant performance at The Open.

The Northern Irishman shot a third-round 68 at Royal Liverpool and is closing in on a momentous piece of European golf history.

Victory today would make him the first European to win three different majors since the Masters was founded in 1934 — and at the age of just 25. Even legends such as Sir Nick Faldo and Seve Ballesteros won only two of the four.

In the swing of things: Rory McIlroy, in action on day three, was the leader after the first two days

‘It would put me in really illustrious company if I won,’ said McIlroy.

Only
 one man in the long history of majors has ever lost such a big final 
round and that was Greg Norman to Faldo at the Masters in 1996.

But
 McIlroy said: ‘I won’t be taking anything for granted. I came back from
 seven shots with a round to go to win the PGA at Wentworth in May so I 
know it can be done.

‘I’ve got to make sure I don’t get ahead of myself and keep the big numbers off my card.

‘A
 lot can happen — I’ve been on the right side of it and the wrong side 
of it, that’s why you can’t let yourself think about winning, you’ve 
just got to stay completely in the present.

‘That’s
 what I’m going to try to do for all 18 holes tomorrow. You have to 
think about how you’re going to control your emotions and focus on what 
you need to do.’

McIlroy, 
who began with a four-shot lead, was caught by American Rickie Fowler at
 the 13th, but an amazing finish to his round saw him muster two eagles 
in his last three holes to open up his sizeable advantage.

He
 received a rapturous reception from the 7,000 fans packed into the 
grandstands at the 18th and the thousands more who had followed him on 
every hole.

‘It’s just a 
pleasure to play in front of people who give you so much support and I 
hope I can give them something to cheer tomorrow,’ he said.

Rory’s
 father Gerry should also be in the money today, for he is in line to 
claim on a bet he made a decade ago, when he placed £100 on his son 
winning The Open by the age of 26 — at odds of 500-1.
