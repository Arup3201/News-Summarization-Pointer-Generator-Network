TV debates between the party leaders will be scrapped by David Cameron, the UK Independence Party claimed today.

UKIP believe the Tories will try to pull the plug on the live debates in 2015 to prevent the Prime Minister having to go head to head with Nigel Farage.

After making gains in local and European elections, UKIP believes it would be impossible for the debates to go ahead without them.

UKIP strategists believe Nigel Farage would have a strong claim to taking part in the debates after strong election success, an idea they beleive David Cameron will jettison

UKIP have heaped pressure on the Tories, winning dozens of county council seats and picking up a quarter of the popular vote.

Many senior Tories blame the debates in 2010 for Mr Cameron's failure to secure an outright majority.

He performed badly in the first encounter, while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg benefited from being comparatively unknown.

Conservative strategists fear Mr Farage could enjoy a similar boost in the polls if he was given a platform in the debates.

"There will not be any television debates in 2015 because David Cameron refuses to debate with Nigel Farage,' a UKIP source told The Guardian,

'If we win the European elections next year it will be completely unjustified not to have us in the debates. Therefore they will not happen.

'It is impossible just to have David Cameron and Ed Miliband in the debates. If you have Nick Clegg you have to have Nigel. Therefore there will be no debates.'

The warning comes after it was suggested Labour leader Ed Miliband also wants to 
block the UKIP from having a role in the debates

Labour had thought UKIP would only damage the Tories' election hopes.

But strategists now fear UKIP's 'brand of anti-politics could damage all three main parties in unpredictable ways,' The Guardian reported.

Mr Clegg enjoyed a surge in the polls in the 2010 polls as a relatively unknown figure alongside Mr Cameron and Gordon Brown.

Spotlight: Labour has joined the Tories in blocking UKIP leader Nigel Farage from the leader's debates held in the build up to the General Election

Until recently Labour had hoped to 
capitalise on the rise of UKIP, hoping it would split the centre-right 
vote and allow them to clinch crucial swing seats.

But recent polls suggest UKIP has taken support from all the main parties.

A source close to Ed Miliband insisted no final decision had been made on UKIP's involvement.

'We've got to get David Cameron to agree to it first. Without him there will be no debates, then we'll worry about keeping Farage out.'

In the Eastleigh by-election UKIP came second pushing the Tories into an embarrassing second.

A
 poll by former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft found UKIP attracted the 
support of 22 per cent of people who voted Tory in 2010, 19 per cent of 
Lib Dem supporters and 17 per cent of Labour voters.
