His face flushed with excitement, this is the astonishing moment Jeff Bauman walked for the first time since losing both of his legs in the Boston Marathon bombings.

The 27-year-old revealed his amazing determination as he took his first steps at the end of May - just six weeks after the incident changed his life and set him on the long and painful road to recovery.

An iconic photograph taken on the day of the Boston Marathon bombings showed Bauman gray-faced with his legs shredded by the blast as he was rushed to the medical tent.

Throughout the months since, he has shared his physical and emotional struggles with the New York Times, which captured the inspiring moment he walked again.

Boston strong: Jeff Bauman, who lost his lower legs in the Boston Marathon bombings, walks on his own for the first time since the marathon as his girlfriend, left, and a prosthetist, right, look on

Bauman explained that he had been near the finish line with two friends to cheer for his girlfriend, Erin Hurley, as she finished the race when he spotted a suspicious-looking man five feet from him.

He noted - and later told investigators - that the man was wearing a baseball cap, sunglasses and a heavy coat, which Bauman thought was bizarre for a warm day.

Suddenly the man vanished and, just as Bauman noticed he'd left a backpack behind, a massive explosion detonated, forcing Bauman and his friends to the ground.

Thinking at first it was a firework, he sat up and was horrified to see the area strewn with blood and injured spectators. He looked for his friends and noticed one staring at his legs in shock.

Life-changing: Carlos Arredondo pinches Bauman's femoral artery as they rush from the blast site moments after the April 15 bombing in Boston. Bauman lost both lower legs and much of his hearing

Pain: He grimaces as he has the sutures removed from what was left of his legs at Boston Medical Center on May 15 - a month after his legs were destroyed by the bombs as he cheered for his girlfriend

Getting ready: Bauman holds a prosthetic leg similar to the ones he will receive at United Prosthetics in Dorchester, Massachusetts on May 21 - ten days before he walked for the first time since the marathon

He looked down at his shredded limbs 
and then back at her, unable to believe what he was seeing - no lower 
legs and bones jutting from the bloodied wounds.

Overwhelmed, he lay down and Allen Panter, an
emergency room physician who had been in the crowd, rushed over and 
secured tourniquets around his legs before racing to save others.

'I'm going to die,' Bauman thought as he laid on his back, alone.

At that point, Carlos Arredondo - the man wearing a cowboy hat pictured beside Bauman in the iconic image - ran over to him and lifted him into a wheelchair.

Arredondo pinched Bauman's femoral artery closed to stop the blood pumping from his destroyed legs and ran beside the wheelchair as they raced for the medical tent.

When he was loaded to the ambulance, Bauman said a woman was speaking to him to keep him alert - and he realized he was unable to hear.

Upbeat: On May 28, he practices ahead of throwing the ceremonial first pitch for a Boston Red Sox game later that day in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, where he is living with his mother

His right eardrum was destroyed when 
the bomb detonated, and his left one suffered a sizable hole, which 
doctors have said is unlikely to heal.

On
the day of the bombings, he underwent an emergency amputation to remove
his legs at the knees, and two days later, flesh was amputated until 
four inches above the knees.

In the weeks after the explosion, Bauman struggled with pain and boredom.

Two weeks on, and he was still being kept awake by burns on his back and by the pains in his thighs. He told the Times that he felt as if someone was hitting his knees.

He also struggled to adjust to his loss of hearing, and said he felt as if he had something held over his ears. The frustrations and echoes still mean he can only play music for a few minutes and is uncomfortable in large rooms.

Reunited: Bauman and Arredondo are pictured together in hospital just days after the deadly bombings

But he has refused to undergo surgery to close the hole in his left eardrum because he cannot face anymore operations, he said.

As
he started to heal from his operations, he spent days in hospital 
undergoing physical therapy, watching television and getting visits from
friends and his girlfriend - the highlight of the day.

He said that in those following weeks, he accepted what had happened and while he couldn't look at his legs, he would surprise people by joking about them as a way to cope.

He added that he didn't think of the bombers and only called them cowards when someone asked.

Bauman left the rehabilitation center around four weeks after the bombings and returned to his mother's home in Chelmsford, Massachusetts.

He would spend all day with his mother, with the only change in pace coming from his cousin, who came over to play computer games, and from his girlfriend, who would visit after work.

Staying strong: Bauman is pictured with his girlfriend, Erin Hurley. He said her visits to hospital or to his home are the highlights of his day and that he is looking forward to a future with her

Together: The couple had been together for around a year before the Boston bombings

Eventually, he began to venture out more
- but said he would rarely pay for anything because people recognized 
him and would shower him with praise and pick up his tab.

He has also made appearances at local games, including throwing the first pitch at Fenway Park - and has become firm friends with Carlos Arredondo, whom he was reunited with in hospital.

And he is also learning to walk after being fitted with the prosethetic legs.

Images taken on the day of his first walk show him grinning as he tries out his first steps.

His girlfriend stood nearby and watched apprehensively as he moved forward, but he assured her that he felt balanced.

Now Bauman is looking to the future - and hopes to one day buy a house with his girlfriend. He said that the tragedy has brought them much closer and made them more affectionate.

On his feet: Bauman stands with his rescuer Carlos Arredondo as they were honored before the start of a game between the Bruins and the Chicago Blackhawks in Boston on June 24

Before the bombings, Bauman worked in the delicatessen at a local Costco. He told the Times he had intentions of returning but that he was worried about being able to stand up all day. He said he had also thought about a career helping other people.

Online fundraisers have helped raise enough money to cover his medical costs - and he has received nearly $3 million from donations and from the One Fund, which helps the Boston victims.

But while he is becoming more independent and appreciating the attention he has been given, he added that he would trade it all just to have his legs back.
