A vigil for a 17-year-old who died in police custody in North Carolina ended in violence on Thursday.

The march was intended as a peaceful memorial for Jesus Huerta, who died in the back of a police car of a gunshot wound to the head last month.

Police, some dressed in riot gear, used tear gas and batons to disperse the crowd of about 150 friends, family and supporters as they marched towards Durham Police Department.

The supporters began at Durham City Hall and marched towards Durham Police Department, shadowed by police.

According to the News Observer, as the crowd surged towards the Police Department parking lot police commanded them to leave.

The crowd continued into the parking lot, some carrying signs that read 'Murdered by police.'

A coordinator of the vigil, Rafael Estrada Maya called for quiet and restraint.

'We are praying! Respect prayer! Respect the dead,' he pleaded over a loudspeaker.

The crowd departed the parking lot and began to move back towards Durham's downtown area where younger members of the crowd chanted and threw firecrackers at the ranks of armed riot police.

Smoke bombs and tear gas were released and according to a witness, police beat protesters with sticks.

'They didn't really look like batons or night sticks, but they were thinner and longer and they were reaching over the banner whacking people with them,' said David Kaplan.

'They were clearly upset with the fact that people were out expressing themselves and upset at the fact that it appears they murdered a 17-year-old child.'

Police Chief Jose Lopez said his officers were restrained in their treatment of the protesters.

'I could not be more proud of the restraint and professionalism demonstrated by our officers," Durham Police Chief Jose Lopez said in a statement to the media.

'There was a march. The peaceful intent did not exist. We used the best practices in law enforcement,' he said at a news conference Friday.

At least six protesters were arrested.

Jose Huerta's sister Evelin Huerta says police 

'The actions of the Durham Police Department, led by Chief Lopez, last night were a tried-and-true tactic to intimidate and spread fear in our community,' she said.

'We call on Chief Lopez to resign immediately in light of his leadership that put dozens of armed police on the streets to scare residents and turned a memorial vigil into a war zone last night. We will not be intimidated by Chief Lopez and the Durham Police Department's tactics.'

The Durham Police Department says that Jose Huerta died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound while he was sitting, handcuffed, in the back of a police cruiser.

He had been taken into custody by Officer Sam Duncan for a second-degree trespassing violation at around 3am on November 19.

According to CNN, Police Chief Lopez told a press conference that gunshot residue tests conducted on Huerta revealed a 'saturation' of gunshot residue on the gloves Huerta was allegedly wearing, while Officer Duncan's hands had none.

Police say the gun used in the shooting was not a police department weapon, but it is standard procedure to search suspects before they are placed in a vehicle for transport.

The case is still under investigation by the State Bureau of Investigation.

It was the second such event for Jesus Huerta that has erupted in violence. A protest last month ended with arrests and damage to police vehicles.

The Huerta family is calling for a federal investigation and demanding that the police department release all information pertinent to the case.

The family intends to hold vigils on the 19th of every month in Huerta's memory until that time.
