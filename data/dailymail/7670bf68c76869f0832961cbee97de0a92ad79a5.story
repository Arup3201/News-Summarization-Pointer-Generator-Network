This is the face of a woman accused of hacking a grandmother to death with a butcher's 
cleaver in an apparent stranger killing.

Nicola Edgington, 31, was due to appear in court charged with the murder of Sally Hodkin, 59, in a busy shopping street  in 
Bexleyheath yesterday.

But Greenwich Magistrates' Court was told Edgington, from Greenwich, south-east London, was unfit to be taken into the courtroom to face charges today due to her 'extreme' mental health problems.

The defendant who has a 'history of mental health problems' was held in the cells but excused from attending the packed courtroom after applications by her counsel, the court's head of security and a psychiatrist.

Dr Amit Chatterjee, duty psychiatrist at the court, said: 'I have had the opportunity to meet her this morning.

'She does have extreme mental health problems. I don't think she is fit to attend court in her mental state.'

A security guard summoned described Edgington's condition said the woman was 'agitated'.

He said: 'At the moment she is in a cell with three officers but I am a bit reluctant to bring her up with everyone around.

'She seems to be very agitated with people in the cells, she's getting very agitated and uppity.' 

Chair of the bench Stephen Langford agreed for the hearing to be held in her absence.

Edgington, who was represented by her solicitor, Callum Haddow, was told her case will be heard next at the Old Bailey on Thursday when a bail application is due to take place.

Mr
Langford said: 'This will be sent to the central criminal court for 
January 17 2012. There will be a bail application on Thursday October 
13.'

Edgington is also charged with the 
attempted murder of a 23-year-old woman, Scotland Yard said.

Sally Hodkin, 59, was killed less than five minutes from her home while on her way to work at a firm of solicitors.

Mrs Hodkin worked 
at law firm Cunningham Blake. An answerphone message at the practice said the office was closed due to a 
bereavement and would reopen today.

An earlier attack left a 23-year-old woman injured at a nearby bus stop.

After stabbing Mrs Hodkin, the attacker calmly approached a shopkeeper and said: 'I think I have just killed someone.

'Can you call the police?'

Last
night it was claimed that the suspect, who has a history of 
mental health problems, attempted to get herself sectioned the night 
before because she had stopped taking her medication, but was turned 
away from hospital. An NHS inquiry has begun.

Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust, which provides mental health services in south-east London, said Edgington had unexpectedly left an assessment suite while a bed was being prepared for her at 7am yesterday.

A statement read: 'Nicola Edgington has been receiving regular treatment from the trust since 2006.

'She attended A&E at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich yesterday at around 5am seeking help and was transferred to our mental health assessment unit at Oxleas House on the QEH site.

'At Oxleas House she was promptly assessed. A bed was available and medication was being prepared before admitting her to a ward on a voluntary basis.

'At 7am she unexpectedly left the assessment suite. Staff saw her leave and pursued her but were unsuccessful.

'Up to this point she had not given any indication she intended to leave and had agreed to admission. Staff notified the police. We will carry out a full and thorough investigation. The trust is shocked and saddened by this tragic incident and would like to pass on our sympathies to family members.'

The
30-minute knife spree began after the attacker bought a six-inch blade 
from an Asda supermarket in Bexleyheath, south-east London, at around 
8am.

On leaving the 
store, she attacked a woman at a nearby bus stop, slashing her hands as 
the victim fought to defend herself in front of horrified 
schoolchildren.

A man in his
50s ran to the victim's aid and the attacker dropped the weapon and ran
off. The victim was left with minor injuries.

But
minutes later the woman burst into a nearby butcher's shop, grabbed a 
12-inch cleaver and lunged at a butcher behind the counter.

David Russell, 59, escaped by running 
out the back of the property. He said: 'She never said a word. She had 
dark hair and her face was pale, ill looking. She seemed calm.

'She just walked round the counter. I 
turned round and was about to say “what do you think you're doing” and 
she got the knife and raised it above her head. It was like a scene from a horror movie.'

Within minutes of leaving the shop, 
the woman encountered Mrs Hodkin, who had just left her £350,000 home in
Bexleyheath on her way to Cunningham Blake solicitors in Blackheath, 
where she worked as an accounts manager.

Mrs Hodkin, who was married to Paul 
and had two sons and two grandchildren, was stabbed once in the neck and
left lying face down in a pool of blood.

The attacker is then said to have 
walked into a tile shop 50 yards away.

Ryan Higgins, who works at 
Bexleyheath Tile Centre, said: 'She said, “I think I've hurt someone, I 
think I have just killed someone. Can you call the police”.

'She seemed in a state of shock. She 
was upset but she didn't seem angry.

When the police arrived she was 
crying quite a bit, she kept telling the officers, “I should have been 
sectioned last night. I need my medicine”.'

Yesterday Mrs Hodkin's nephew Ken 
said: 'We're too upset to speak right now.'

Detective Superintendent 
Keith Niven, leading the inquiry, said: 'At this early stage of the 
investigation we have no information to suggest the victims are known to
each other or the suspect.'
