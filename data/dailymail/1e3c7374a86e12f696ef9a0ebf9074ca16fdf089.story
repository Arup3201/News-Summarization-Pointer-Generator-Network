Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill is set to compete in her first heptathlon since landing London 2012 gold and becoming a mother when she heads to Austria at the end of May.

Ennis-Hill, who has also married since claiming Olympic glory, will be back in action at the Hypo-Meeting in Gotzis over the weekend of May 30-31, taking her first steps towards the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

Meeting officials announced her involvement on their website, with Ennis-Hill returning to an event where she previously triumphed in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

It was also confirmed that Ennis-Hill's British team-mate Katarina Johnson-Thompson will defend the title she won last year, providing stiff competition.

Ennis-Hill did not take part in a heptathlon during an injury-affected 2013 season and in July 2014 gave birth to her first child, Reggie.

Ennis-Hill wants to defend her Olympic gold at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 

She is eager to defend her Olympic title in Rio in 2016 and told BBC Sport in December: 'I'm looking forward to the Olympics, I really want to be there and want to be a contender and that's what keeps me motivated.

'I have two years to get the work done and get where I was, I'm still the competitive person I was and I really hope I can contend for a gold medal.

'London 2012 was fantastic and it will be very hard to top, but if I am able to get work done and get to Rio and win a gold medal having had a child, that would be unbelievable.'
