He’s battled the forces of evil in X-Men, explored the deepest regions of space in Star Trek, and has even been knighted for his achievements in acting.

But there’s one thing Sir Patrick Stewart could not do – deal with the local cable company.

The British actor spent a harrowing 36 hours waiting for cable empire Time Warner to come to his $2million home in Brooklyn, only to tweet that the experience made him lose ‘the will to live.’

Make it so: British actor Patrick Stewart, pictured in April, said that dealing with Time Warner Cable made him lose 'the will to live'

The final frontier: Stewart is perhaps best known for his roles in Star Trek: The Next Generation, left, as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, and for portraying Professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men franchise, right

The 72-year-old thespian, having recently moved into a $2million home in Park Slope, was saddled with the mundane task of setting up his cable.

But what should have been a few hours’ time turned into an Odyssey for the Shakespearean actor.

He tweeted on September 13: ‘All I wanted to do was set up a new account with (Time Warner Cable) but 36hrs later I’ve lost the will to live,’ the actor tweeted.

Some of Stewart’s followers tweeted their support. 

One fan asked: ‘Did you tell them to “make it so”?’ in reference to Stewart’s famous catchphrases as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation.

Twitter war: Stewart tweeted his frustration at the cable company, and said it was too little, too late when they offered support

According to the New York Post, Stewart’s former Star Trek co-star LeVar Burton chimed in, tweeting a sympathetic: ‘Been there.’

Time Warner, which is notorious for long wait times and poor customer service, responded back on Twitter. ‘How can we assist you?’ they asked on their help handle.

But it was too late for Stewart, who replied via Twitter: ‘If that question had been asked at any time in the last 36 hours it would have been of value. But now…’

Later that night, Time Warner tried to apologise for his frustration, saying: ‘If you change your mind we are here.  ^SS.’

The power of who? A representative for Time Warner said that any customer - no matter who they are - will receive the same treatment

A representative for Time Warner’s New York branch told the Post: ‘There’s no doubt we have a lot of fans at the company, of the actor, and Star Trek in general,’ the representative began.

‘But the truth is, any customer that reaches out to us… we’re going to offer them help the exact same way.’

There has been no further mention of the cable company on Stewart's Twitter feed.

On Yelp, Time Warner Cable received a lowly one-and-a-half stars out of five with 47 mostly angry reviews. 

One Yelper wrote: ‘TW hit a new low in customer service. The cable installation rep went to the wrong address, as TW has entered someone else's address on my account -- and the rep called and threatened to kill me if I did not open the door.’
