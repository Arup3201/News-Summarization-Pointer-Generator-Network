They seemed to be a typical couple of tourists – at least, that’s what the staff of the £48-a-night Hotel Choiseul first thought.

Like others before them, they wandered hand-in-hand around the charming streets surrounding the Place de Tourny in central Bordeaux, stopping off for drinks in pavement cafes and enjoying bistro meals.

Yet the couple who stayed on the third floor of the cramped anonymous ‘hideaway’ with white, unadorned walls were far from ordinary.

For this was the hotel where 
15-year-old schoolgirl Megan Stammers and her former maths teacher 
Jeremy Forrest, 30, stayed the night after they fled Britain.

Last night Megan was reunited with 
her mother Danielle Wilson, while the French lawyer for Forrest, who had
been arrested on suspicion of child abduction, said his client was 
‘very disappointed by the brutal ending of his love story’.

Looking back, as the hotel staff now 
concede, there was perhaps something unusual about them. Not least, for 
instance, the way Forrest left his companion waiting outside, standing 
near a Chinese restaurant, her arms sheepishly folded, while he checked 
in. He paid in cash – €61 up front.

Explaining that his partner would join him shortly, he registered using an assumed name, Jack Grant.

‘He seemed calm and relaxed; but I never saw her close up,’ said a hotel worker. 

Their temporary bolthole was revealed as further extraordinary details of their disappearance began to be revealed yesterday.

Forrest and Megan boarded a ferry from Dover to Calais nine days ago, sparking an international manhunt. 

Police are now investigating how the 
passport belonging to mother-of-five Mrs Wilson came into her daughter’s
hands – and how the teenager managed to pass herself off as 37.

A UK Border Agency spokesman said the
travel company used by the pair to get to France was responsible for 
checking passport details, but it is unclear which operator the pair 
used.

They went to Paris but apparently 
remained in the capital for only a matter of hours before dumping 
Forrest’s black Ford Fiesta and boarding a high-speed TGV train at 
Montparnasse station then travelling to Bordeaux, 400 miles away in the 
south-west of the country.

As Megan leaves France, the maths teacher accused of abducting her was said to be 'very disappointed by the brutal ending of his love story'

Megan used her 37-year-old mother's Danielle Wilson's, passport to board the ferry, it was claimed

Once there, they were not required to
show their passports when they checked into the Choiseul, a two-star 
hotel which stands half way down the Rue Huguerie in central Bordeaux. 
‘It is not something we ask for,’ said a member of staff.

The sparsely furnished blue-carpeted room Megan stayed in overlooks rooftops and a tiny courtyard.

Above a dressing table, a small television is fixed to a wall. An old-fashioned phone sits on a bedside table.

They stayed just one night and, then,
after repeatedly moving hotels, Forrest – who had been scrupulous until
this point about remaining anonymous – made a crucial error, one that 
his lawyer said ended his ‘love story’ and dream of a new life.

The teacher chose to look for work in
an English pub – the HMS Victory, staffed by English and Irish workers 
and popular with the expat crowd, on Bordeaux’s main shopping street, 
the bustling Rue Sainte Catherine.

He was recognised by the manageress, 
who claimed he said he was a freelance music journalist who had worked 
for the NME. She suggested he return the following day. In the meantime 
she contacted police and later positively identified him from other 
photographs.

‘He also said he was in his 20s,’ said a bar worker.

Among the qualifications he claimed 
to have was a degree in journalism from Northampton University, and he 
also said he had worked as a bartender at the Rising Sun pub in Eltham, 
South-East London, and later as an human resources administrator for IPC
Media in London. No mention was made of his teaching career.

He said that he was a keen writer and
musician doing freelance work for rock magazines Kerrang and Big 
Cheese, and said he still did regular work for NME.

Sussex Police officers, who had 
already been alerted to the possibility that the couple were in 
Bordeaux, flew to the city on Thursday as a trap was sprung. Police lay 
in wait from early on Friday and detained Forrest as he strolled to the 
HMS Victory with Megan along Rue Sainte Catherine at lunchtime.

‘It happened discreetly, with little fuss,’ said a police source. ‘Mr Forrest co-operated fully.’

Yesterday his French lawyer, Daniel 
Lalane, said: ‘He was arrested when looking for work to extend his stay 
in France a little longer in a country that is perhaps a little more 
understanding. He is a charming, discreet, lovely man. He is not 
depressed, just disappointed.’ After the arrest Megan was taken into 
protective custody, and returned to Gatwick on a 3.15pm easyJet flight 
yesterday for an emotional reunion with her family. 

Her mother left her semi-detached home in Eastbourne, East Sussex, with a police family liaison officer, shortly after 1pm.

Megan’s stepfather Martin Stammers 
said he was ‘over the moon’. ‘I’m thrilled and overjoyed. The most 
amazing thing is the joy I feel in here,’ he added, pointing to his 
heart. ‘You can’t describe the feeling.’ 

Megan and Forrest fled to France 24 hours after the teacher was told he was due to be suspended.
Staff at the Bishop Bell CofE School 
in Eastbourne are believed to have alerted British police to their 
concerns about the relationship between teacher and pupil.

Despite this, the pair were able to 
travel to France, and until yesterday the last confirmed sighting had 
been CCTV footage of them arm-in-arm on the ferry.

Mrs Wilson has always said that she 
and Megan’s 43-year-old stepfather knew nothing about the UK authorities
being concerned about the teenager’s closeness to Forrest. 

French police piecing together their journey believe they then drove south from Calais to Paris. 
Their black Ford Fiesta is understood 
to have been found in the French capital, where they are believed to 
have been spotted by a British tourist last Sunday.

After vanishing last Thursday, police found the schoolgirl and maths teacher in Bordeaux, France

A French police source said: ‘They 
dumped their car close to a mainline station and headed for Bordeaux – 
clearly they knew the authorities were on to them. 

‘They thought they could blend into day-to-day life in Bordeaux.’ 

Forrest, from Ringmer, near Lewes, 
East Sussex, was due before a judge at a private hearing in Bordeaux 
last night to be formally served with a European arrest warrant and 
remanded in custody.
He will appear at a public hearing in 
Bordeaux’s Court of Appeal on Tuesday and his fast-track extradition 
back to the UK is expected within days. 

Last night his lawyer said: ‘He has 
agreed to return to the UK as soon as possible without the need for 
protracted extradition proceedings.’ 

As he contemplates the possibility of
criminal charges, Forrest is being held with men facing trial for 
murder and rape in a notoriously violent jail. He is in a shared cell in
the massively overcrowded Gradignan prison, on the outskirts of 
Bordeaux.

It is officially meant to hold around
400 remand prisoners, but numbers regularly spiral towards the 1,000 
mark, meaning cell sharing and regular ‘lock downs’ as warders trying to
enforce discipline.

Fights and attacks on inmates are 
frequent, with up to half a dozen suicides a year prompting protests 
from human rights groups. 

In 2001 a prisoner was murdered by his cellmate.
