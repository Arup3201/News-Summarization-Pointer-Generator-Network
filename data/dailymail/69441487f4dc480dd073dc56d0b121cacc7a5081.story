It's arguably the sexiest fashion show of the year its stunning models and superstar singing acts draw in 
millions of viewers every year.

And now, lingerie giant Victoria's Secret has revealed a glimpse into the details of its 2013 show, set to take place on Tuesday December 10.

The 2013 offering will star its most famous Angels to date, including Adriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio, Lily Aldridge and Candice Swanepoel.

There will also be appearances from Lindsay Ellingson, Doutzen Kroes and Behati Prinsloo, as well as New York fashion week starlet Karlie Kloss.

But there are a few familiar faces missing from this year's line-up, most notably long-time Runway Angel Miranda Kerr.

The 30-year-old was the first Australian Victoria's Secret Angel when she was signed back in 2007, replacing Gisele BÃ¼ndchen.

Miranda had already been chosen to become the successor of Alessandra Ambrosio as the face of PINK in 2006 and she fast became known as the most recognisable Victoria's Secret poster girl.

However, the brunette announced in April that she was streamlining her Victoria's Secret duties to focus on being a mother to her son Flynn.

And as for Brit favourites Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn, it is yet to be revealed whether they will walk again. The two are not official Victoria's Secret Angels, but were made Runway Angels when they walked in last year's catwalk show.

Cara, 21, has been notably absent from New York Fashion Week, and reports have suggested she is instead focusing on her acting career.

The lavish event, which airs on American television channel CBS on December 10, attracts hundreds of 
celebrities and entertainers and each year has a different theme.

The
models don giant angel and butterfly wings, as well as peacock and 
ostrich feathers, all of which have become emblematic of the Victoria's 
Secret lingerie brand.

One Direction were rumoured to be taking to the stage during the show, which is taking place in New York.

This has, however, been quashed, with further details of performers expected to be announced in October.

Speaking to Vogue.co.uk about the runway show, Erin Heatherton said it is all 'big personalities, big hair'.

'It's
a lot of fun,' she said. 'I think there's something special and timeless about 
girls getting ready together. This is the ultimate display - 
head-to-toe.'

Speaking about pre-show preparations, Behati Prinsloo added: 'It's a girls' club! It's kind of manic back there, but also fun and exciting.'
