A mystery virus being referred to as 'the plague' continues to sweep through a Texas high school, having already infected over 700 students and staff members and causing them to become violently ill.

The health department is trying to find the source of the stomach illness that first hit Richardson High School in North Texas last week, according to NBC, while cleaners have been brought in to scrub every possible surface on the premises to prevent the bug from spreading.

'It is scary, it really is,' father Demetrius Price, whose son was sent home sick, told NBC 5.

'For that many kids to get sick at one time is scary.'

Last Friday, over 700 students and staff members were absent from Richardson High School in North Texas after falling ill

School officials have ruled out the cafeteria as the source, believing it is not food related, however they don't know where the virus has come from.

It all started Monday of last week, with 203 students and 12 staff members off sick.

By Thursday, 349 students were absent, along with 22 staff members.

Additionally, 70 more students were sent home at lunch.

By Friday, an astonishing 675 students - about a quarter of the school's total student population of 2,500 - missed class, along with 28 staff members.

Despite having the weekend as a buffer and the extreme cleaning measures taking place at the school, the situation was only slightly better on Monday.

The Richardson Independent School District was able to confirm that 26 staff members and 239 students were sick Monday.

According to the district, there 191 students that called in and another 48 sent home early due to the illness.

The main symptoms of the bug are vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue and weakness.

Health experts have said the easiest way to stop the spread is general hygiene, specifically diligent hand washing.

Mr Price said that when he came to pick up his freshmen son, the nurse's office was 'over run' with hundreds of sick kids.

'My son had a cold a few weeks ago, during that cold snap, but nothing serious,' Mr Price told NBC 5.

'This right here was so different.

'It put him on the couch. His energy was low. His appetite was gone.

Worried parent: Demetrius Price, whose freshmen son was sent home with the sickness, described the virus as 'very scary'

'He kept feeling like he had to throw up. I don't know what it is. I was worried he was going to get real dehydrated.'

Students started up a Twitter hashtag about the mysterious virus, called '#RHSPlague' and are trying to make light of the situation with jokes like 'More Plague = Better Parking'.

The students that were in attendance Monday came armed with hand sanitizer.

Others said they planned to go to the bathroom after each period to wash their hands.
