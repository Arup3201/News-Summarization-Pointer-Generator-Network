Secretly snapping away in shopping malls across the country as a 20-year-old aspiring photographer during the Eighties, Micheal Galinsky never gave the people in his pictures much thought.

But after recently publishing the intriguing compilation of images in a book titled Malls Across America
and online, the Brooklyn-based father-of-two has received messages from those who have spotted themselves or relatives.

A man name David Walczak recognized his father in one of Mr Galinsky’s photos, just days after attending his memorial service and said he was 'shocked'. The vintage snap shows a blond-haired couple with their backs turned riding down an escalator.

Mr Walczak wrote in an email shared with Today.com: 'That photo . . . is of my parents. I recognized them as soon as I saw it.

'The really shocking thing is we had my father’s memorial on November 7th, and visited his grave on the 8th. It really feels like my father chose this vehicle to let my family know he is in a good place.'

In another picture Jamie Rutina did a double-take when he saw himself over two decades ago rocking puffy hair and a leather-look bomber jacket.

'So your going to think this sounds crazy but I'm so sure that I'm the guy [there],' he typed in a message to 44-year-old Mr Galinsky.

He added: 'You cant see my face cuz [sic] I'm looking down at something, but I know it's me, the hair is mine, the coat, the stance/mannerism. I was 20 years old then.'

Like Mr Walczak, Samantha Schneider from Macomb, Michigan, was surprised when she saw one of her parents in a shot.

She exclaimed on Facebook, where many of the images were shared: 'This is actually very hilarious to me right now. The female on the far right of the three teenage girls is my mother (Marlene Anderson).

'It's really powerful to see yourself randomly in that way. It's shocking'

'The blonde is Brigette Sloan and the brunette in the middle's name is Sue one of my mother's friends from High School, although my mother cannot remember her last name.

'I believe they are in front of Bakers shoes, according to my mother that's what the store behind them looks like.'

Mr Galinsky said the experience has made him realize the true power of photography.

'It’s really powerful to see yourself randomly in that way. It’s shocking.'

While he has confirmed some of the subjects, he says that most times people mistakenly see themselves.

Indeed, one woman wrote on Facebook: 'Can u plz [sic] tell me what mall this taken in if you remember, I think this is me . . . I worked at the ice cream shop in the mall during the late 80s early 90s - this was a really popular look so I understand it may not be me.'

But when Mr Galinsky confirmed the location as Smith Haven Mall in Lake Grove, New York, the woman replied: 'Then not me! I wish I could show you my photos from then .. it looks just like me.'

'That photo is of my parents. We had my father’s memorial on November 7. It feels like he chose this vehicle to let us know he is in a good place.'

Mr Galinsky, who is now a photographer, musician and award-winning filmmaker, was just 20 when he began 
driving across the U.S. in 1989, capturing pictures from shopping 
malls in different states for a college art project.

In an extract from his book, he writes that his college photography teacher at New York 
University encouraged him to travel across the country after she saw 
photos he had taken at the local mall in Garden City, Long Island.

In
 1989, he embarked on a road trip to the West Coast with a friend, and 
by the time they got to San Francisco they had visited over a dozen 
malls and even more thrift stores and antique shops.

While the tiled floors, 
artificial plants and brightly-lit stores are recognizable features of 
malls to this day, the customers' hairstyles and fashion reveal the era 
these photos were taken in.

Do you know who this is? One woman thought this was her in the photo but the location of the mall didn't match up to the ice cream parlor where she used to work

Mr Galinsky told Today.com in 2011 that the time period is just as significant as the physical setting of his photos.

'At the time, the mall was the new public space, the new community center where people would interact.

'It was surreal to walk around - even the "restaurants" in the food court were the same. This was America'

'This was pre-Internet, pre-cellphone, there was smoking in malls, it 
was before the Gulf War. It was this weird moment in time where things 
were getting ready to change.'

Indeed,
 one of the most noticeable aspects of the images is their lack of cell 
phones, iPads and other technology that play such a large role in our 
lives today.

Another detail that reveals these photos are relics from the past is that several of the subjects are smoking inside the mall.

In
 one such photo, a woman perches on a sofa puffing on a cigarette while 
children play by a water feature in a shopping mall lobby.

The
 signs for shops like Tape World and Musicland also reveal a bygone era,
 as do the boxy television sets being sold at one of the stores.

Mr
 Galinsky says one of the ground-breaking moments on his road trip was 
when he visited a mall in St Louis, Missouri, and he realized it was 
identical to one he had been to in Vancouver, Washington.

'It
 was a completely surreal experience to walk around that space,’ he 
says. 'Even the "restaurants" in the food court were the same. This was 
America.'

Mr Galinsky launched a Kickstarter campaign in 2011 in order to raise money to publish his book of photos.

He
 explained on his Kickstarter page that while he had no idea the images would 
spark such an interest today, part of their intrigue is the mystery of 
where each photo was captured.

'It
 was hard to tell from the images where they were taken, and that was 
kind of the point,' he writes. 'I was interested in the creeping loss of
 regional differences.'
