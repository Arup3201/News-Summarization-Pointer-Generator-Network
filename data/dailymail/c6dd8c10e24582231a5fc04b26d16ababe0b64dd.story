But the boxes also allow a glimpse into how Christmas was celebrated in days gone by.

Tom, a confectioner's apprentice was on a trip to Paris in 1840 when he saw some almond bon bons wrapped in tissue paper with a twist at each end.

He worked on introducing something similar to the people of London and for seven years he developed the idea.

He added mottoes and poems inside each one and the cracking mechanism - inspired by listening to the crackle of a log fire - was a strip of paper impregnated with chemicals which, when rubbed, created enough friction to produce a noise. 

His sons, Tom, Walter and Henry took over the business when he died and it was Walter who introduced the paper hats and toured the world to find unusual gifts to put inside.

The company was very aware of current affairs and created many sets of crackers to mark occasions such as the Russo-Japanese War crackers, printed in 1907 (pictured) just after the Russian and Japanese military conflict ended

The company was very aware of current affairs and as these vibrant images show, they created many sets of crackers to mark occasions.

Among those pictured are the Russo-Japanese War crackers, printed in 1907, just after the Russian and Japanese military conflict ended.

Also featured are the Motoring crackers printed in 1907 and the Telephone crackers designed in 1878 - two years after the man who invented the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell, was first granted a patent for the phone in 1876.

Contents were tailored to each box with grotesque or artistic masks, puzzles, conundrums, tiny treasures, jewels, games and mottoes.

Most of the beautifully illustrated boxes, crackers and hats were made by hand and the company still produces crackers today. 

Another British company strongly associated with the cracker business is Batger and Co.

Tom Smith, the inventor of the Christmas cracker 

Tom Smith had been a young confectioner's apprentice when he first had the idea for the Christmas cracker,an invention which would go onto become an integral part of the British festive season.

On a trip to Paris in 1840 he had been inspired by some almond bon bons wrapped in tissue paper with a twist at each end.

It was a simple idea which, over the next seven years, would eventually evolve into the cracker.

He brought over the bon bon to London as part of his wedding cake ornament and confectionery business.

It proved a big hit at Christmas and then in January, Smith decided to add a small love motto in the tissue paper to improve sales.

But it was the breakthrough of adding the cracker's iconic snap, inspired by the crackle of a log as he threw it on his fire, that eventually led to the crackers we know today. Smith discovered that a strip of paper impregnated with chemicals, when rubbed, created enough friction to produce a noise which delighted his customers.

In 1847, he dropped the name of bon bon and called his new crackers Cosaques, but he kept the motto and added a surprise gift.

The crackers became an overnight success and at the turn of the century, Tom Smith produced crackers not only for the Christmas season but also to celebrate every major occasion from The Paris Exhibition in 1900 to War Heroes in 1918 and the Russian Japanese conflict in 1907.

Smith toured the world to find unusual and precious trinkets for his crackers, which were tailored to each box such as artistic masks, puzzles and games.

When he died he left the business to his three sons, Tom Henry and Walter.

The company have also been making crackers for the royals for over a hundred years.

Tom Smith also had a range of crackers marking Asian culture in 1907 such as the Jewels of Asia Japanese (pictured) which shows a woman choosing a necklace with the help of two young girls, and a box of Tom Smith's crackers

Like Tom Smith, they sold a wide variety of crackers in highly decorated boxes and once again many were themed or in commemoration of a special event.

Featured in this collection is the Wireless Crackers set which shows Santa wearing headphones and taking a call from a little girl in bed. This label was printed in the 1930s during the early days of radio.

Another box called Television Crackers shows a family watching a television set, with children using the crackers to scare their elderly relatives. This label was printed in 1950 during the early days of television.

Crackers were an incredibly expensive luxury at the time costing from 14 shillings to 30 shillings a box.
