Portland Fire & Rescue's spokesman may be re-assigned after he was arrested for driving drunk on Saturday evening.

An employee of Portland's Fire & Rescue service in Oregon is likely to be demoted with the organization after being arrested for drink driving on Saturday evening.

Richard Chatman, 37, who is currently a spokesman for the service was taken into custody just before midnight.

Multnomah County Sheriff's records show that he was booked at 1:16 a.m. Sunday by Portland Police officers.

Chatman was charged with driving under the influence of intoxicants.

He has worked with the service for 16 years but only recently became Portland Fire & Rescue's Public Information Officer since January 2013.

There was no accident or injuries associated to the incident.

Chief Erin Janssens stated, 'I'm saddened by this incident and know Lt. Chatman feels tremendous remorse for allowing himself to become impaired and fail to exercise good judgment.

I'm very relieved no one was injured; we remind everyone of the importance to not drink and drive. If you are going to be drinking, please do so responsibly, and always designate a driver, use public transportation or taxi service.'

Chatman will be re-assigned from his regular duties pending the results of this case and an internal review.
