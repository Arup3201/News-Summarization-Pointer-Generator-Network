Channel 4 has admitted it made a mistake in editing the word ‘gay’ out of an episode of The Simpsons.

The broadcaster’s compliance department removed a seconds-long section of the cartoon broadcast on Sunday afternoon.

But yesterday a spokesman for Channel 4 backtracked, admitting censors had acted ‘in error’ because ‘neither the word nor the context was unsuitable’.

'Overly cautious': Channel 4's compliance department cut the word 'gay' from an episode of cartoon The Simpsons aired on Sunday afternoon

The line was cut from a 1994 episode of The Simpsons, called Homer Loves Flanders, screened at 12.55pm on Sunday.

In the episode Homer goes to an American football match with neighbour Ned Flanders but at first is embarrassed to be seen with the religious man.

The pair bond after Ned introduces Homer to the star quarterback.

As they drive away, they pass Homer’s workmates Lenny and Carl.

Homer proudly yells out of the window: ‘I want everyone to know that this is Ned Flanders ... my friend!’

In the original episode, Lenny turns to Carl and says: ‘What’d he say?’

Carl replies: ‘I dunno. Somethin’ about being gay.’

However in the version screened on Sunday, Carl’s line was edited out.

The episode abruptly cut to adverts after Lenny said: ‘What’d he say?’

'What'd he say?' Carl's reply to Lenny was cut from the episode by Channel 4's compliance department

Channel 4 said that Simpsons episodes broadcast before 6pm are checked by its compliance department for unsuitable content, and that in this instance the department had been overly-cautious.

A spokesman said: ‘We always carefully consider the context in which language is used in our programming.

‘However in this instance the episode was edited in error as neither the word nor the context was unsuitable.’

Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, says there is no evidence to conclude that use of the word ‘gay’ is ‘necessarily and automatically intended to be, or is, offensive.’

Broadcasters are told to restrict usage of ‘gay’ in a negative context when children are likely to be watching, as it could contribute to bullying.

In May 2006, Chris Moyles was accused of being homophobic after he dismissed a ringtone, saying ‘I don’t want that one, it’s gay,’ on his Radio 1 Breakfast Show.

After receiving complaints, the BBC defended the presenter, arguing that the word ‘gay’, in addition to being used to mean ‘homosexual’ or ‘carefree’, is also used as a synonym for ‘lame’ or ‘rubbish’.

The same year Oxford University student Sam Brown was arrested for making homophobic remarks and spent the night in a cell after he called a police horse ‘gay’.

The CPS decided that there was not enough evidence to prosecute Mr Brown and it dropped the case.
