No other way to obey: Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said she supports calls for a Press regulator

Labour will back statutory regulation of the press deputy leader Harriet Harman reveals today.

In an interview with The Spectator magazine, Miss Harman said the opposition supports calls for a law to set up a press regulator, arguing there is no other way of ensuring papers agree to obey the rules.

The intervention puts Labour at odds with some senior Tories, including the Prime Minister, who has warned that he would prefer to avoid statutory regulation since that could lead future generations of MPs to meddle with press freedom.

Miss Harman has made clear Labour opposes political interference in the content of papers, and any attempt to police the division between fact and comment - proposals examined by Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry into the media.

But she rejected a proposal drawn up by Lord Black and Lord Hunt on behalf of the existing regulator the Press Complaints Commission which would have seen papers sign a binding contract with the regulator to stick to the rules with punitive fines when they are broken.

That plan would avoid the need for a new law, but Miss Harman said that would not be tough enough since it may lack the teeth to force proprietors like Richard Desmond of the Daily Express - who withdrew from the PCC.

Miss Harman said: ‘The big challenge is how you make sure that we get a proper press complaints system,’ arguing that previous failures ‘gave the press a sense of impunity’.

‘In terms of the press complaints the fundamental issue is not having a situation where people decide not to opt into a press complaints system.

‘Any press complaints system has got to deal with the problem of impunity. It has got to apply to all the newspapers not just those who chose to have it apply to them.

‘For all that Guy Black and Lord Hunt think that people are going to sign binding contracts, Richard Desmond has already said he might not, so I think there will need to be a statutory underpinning’ of the new organisation ‘independent from Parliament, politicians and government’.

She added: ‘It’s hard to see how you can otherwise have something which applies to all newspapers but which does not gave that power. However else could it be done?’ The way is now paved for a political row over the recommendations of Lord Justice Leveson, who is expected to propose some sort of statutory regime when he reports next month.

Nick Clegg has said the Lib Dems will back Leveson, and if necessary a statutory code as long as his proposals are ‘proportionate’.

She also insisted that newspaper websites should be covered by the same press code of conduct as their papers - despite claims from editors that this puts them at a commercial disadvantage relative to other internet media outlets.

‘It’s the newspapers’ own code so it’s quite invidious of them to argue that it’ s oppressive for them to abide by it when they’ve said that is the code they themselves have adopted.

‘The papers remain very influential particularly in setting the whole agenda for the rest of the media so having accountability is very important.’ She said it would be ‘difficult’ to draw up a new regulator for internet publications but would merely ask some web-based media outlets to ‘opt-in’ to the new organisation.

‘You could certainly have a position which applies to all newspapers but allows them to opt-in even if they’re offshore.’
