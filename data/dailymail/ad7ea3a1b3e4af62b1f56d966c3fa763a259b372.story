Facing charges: Aideen Jones resigned after being charged with three cruelty offences against young boys

A charity fundraiser was given an OBE for her work with vulnerable people in the 2014 New Year’s Honours list – while she was under arrest on suspicion of child abuse.

Aideen Jones has since been charged with three cruelty offences against two young boys in a case linked to the long-running North Wales abuse scandal.

The 62-year-old, a former chief executive of Southdown Housing Association, was given the OBE a year ago ‘for services to people with intellectual disabilities’ despite being arrested the previous August by officers working on the investigation, Operation Pallial.

Her husband Denis, 65, who once worked as a development officer at East Sussex Social Services with a ‘lead responsibility for fostering staff training’, has also been charged with four offences relating to two boys aged under 16 between 1975 and 1980.

The couple will appear at Wrexham Magistrates’ Court on March 25. The revelation will inevitably raise questions because the Honours Committee, chaired by the head of the Civil Service, Sir Bob Kerslake, appears to have agreed to the award while Jones was under investigation, and announced the OBE in January 2014, four months after her arrest.

Mr and Mrs Jones, who have been married for 41 years, were both carers at Bryn Alyn, one of 18 children’s homes in the former counties of Clywd Gynedd caught up in the historic child abuse scandal.

The home’s owner John Allen, 73, was given a life sentence last December after he was found guilty of historical sex offences against 18 boys and one girl, and must serve a minimum of 11 years.

Detectives are looking into 249 allegations of abuse at the homes between 1963 and 1992 and have arrested 35 people since the investigation began in 2012. Fifteen people have been charged, including Allen. Fourteen are due to stand trial this year, two released without charge and the remainder are on bail, while investigations continue.

Mrs Jones, who is a fellow of the Institute of Directors, and her husband Denis have been living in Seaford, East Sussex, since 1983, and have become well known in the community, opening their courtyard garden to visitors to raise money for charity. Both have worked with vulnerable adults for the past four decades and ran their own company Praxis Training and Development Ltd until it was voluntarily dissolved in 2012.

Jones, a former director of the Sussex Chamber of Commerce and the Housing and Support Alliance, resigned from her housing association job in November 2013 for ‘health and personal’ reasons.

Her husband founded the company Junction (Young People Connecting) and was a director of Stay Up Late, a charity which promotes ‘full and active social lives for people with learning disabilities’. He resigned in October 2013.

A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said it could not comment on individual cases, but added: ‘As part of the nomination process, we try to minimise the risk that prospective candidates have behaved in ways likely to bring the system into disrepute.

‘We protect the integrity of the honours system by carrying out probity checks with a number of Government departments before names are submitted.’
