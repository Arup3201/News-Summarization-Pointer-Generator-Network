Brendan Rodgers has warned Liverpool that Real Madrid are the best counter-attacking side in the world and highlighted Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale's Olympic-standard pace as the key to their threat. 

The Reds manager has given a stunning interview to Spanish newspaper AS in which he admits that he wants to manage in Spain one day and that his team are struggling after losing Luis Suarez in the summer.

Liverpool limped to a 3-2 victory over QPR at Loftus Road on Sunday, which was clinched thanks to two own goals. But their task will be an awful lot tougher at Anfield on Wednesday night when Ronaldo and Bale will, if fit, lead the European champions into battle against Rodgers' underdogs.

Brendan Rodgers has given a wide-ranging interview with Spanish newspaper AS, published on Monday - the translation of the quote on the front page says: 'I've not seen a team like this Madrid for a long time'

* Liverpool struggles after losing Suarez are just a 'short-term hit' on our 'magic carpet ride', insists Rodgers

* Rodgers: I want to manage in Spain one day... and I'm already learning Spanish from my Liverpool players to get ready 

The Northern Irishman suggested that Ronaldo and Bale were so fast they could even give Usain Bolt, Justin Gatlin and Co a run for their money.

'There is no one better on the counter attack because in Ronaldo and Bale, they have two players that could be in the Olympic 100 metres final,' he said.

But Rodgers was also keen to stress that Carlo Ancelotti's side are not a two-man team and boast attacking threats all over the pitch.

He did, however, single out an unlikely player to praise among Madrid's galaxy of galacticos: defender Sergio Ramos.

'Of course (Ronaldo) is a player that you have to focus on but the team as a whole is incredible. You have Modric, Kroos, wonderful technicians who can play short, long.

'I’m also a big admirer of Sergio Ramos since his young days at Sevilla where he came through the system before making a move and then making to over 100 caps for Spain. It’s an incredible achievement and he is fast and he is strong and he has personality. I like him a lot.'
