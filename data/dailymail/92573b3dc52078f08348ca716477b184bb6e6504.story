A veteran primary school teacher habitually assaulted pupils as young as five at a Roman Catholic school, a professional panel has been told.

Margaret Wood-Robinson is accused of pushing, pinching and hitting children in a series of attacks over a five year period at Saint Maryâ€™s Roman Catholic Primary School in Pembroke Dock, Wales.

The former teacher, who is in her late 50s, was dismissed from her job for gross misconduct in January 2013 and at the time branded the allegations 'ridiculous' and insisted the pupils were not telling the truth.

Mrs Wood-Robinson is accused of physically assaulting nine pupils over a five-year period going back to late 2007.

The pupils are referred to only by the letters A to I to protect their identity. At least four parents will also be giving evidence at the professional panel.

One
 mother briefly told the panel that her six-year-old daughter, pupil D, 
was hit on the head during a maths lesson after asking for help.

The
 mother said Mrs Wood-Robinson told her daughter she was too busy and 
that pupil D should help other pupils with their work instead. She then 
struck the pupil around the head, it was claimed.

Mrs Wood-Robinson, who has no legal representation, failed to attend the start of the hearing at the General Teaching Council for Wales building in Cardiff yesterday.

During the hearing, the professional panel was told how pupils aged between five and seven regularly returned home with bruises and red marks on their arms after a day at school.

Mrs Wood-Robinson, who had been teaching for 35-years, was suspended from the school in 2012 when an internal inquiry into her conduct as a teacher of year one and two pupils was launched.

A joint police and social services 
investigation was also later carried out which interviewed pupils and 
their parents, as well as staff at the school.

While a decision was taken not to launch a criminal prosecution, police continued to interview pupils.

The
 professional panel heard how Mrs Wood-Robinson dismissed all the 
allegations against her at the time as 'ridiculous', denied ever 
touching her pupils, and insisted they were lying.

She failed to attend the start of yesterdayâ€™s hearing, which is scheduled to run for three days.

Rosa Fernandez, the case presenter, said the former teacher would not be attending the hearing and had made no 'substantive' response to the allegations.

She said Mrs Wood-Robinson claims to have retired, to be in poor health, and unable to teach again.

The hearing continues.
