An electrician was dragged behind a van for 100 yards when the vehicle was hijacked as he was working on it.

Irvin Shorte's hand became trapped in a ring of electrical wire meaning he could not let go of the van, and he feared for his life as he was dragged along the ground by the heartless thieves.

He was able to steady himself only because he was wearing brand new steel-capped boots, which threw out sparks during his ordeal.

Warning: graphic images

Pain: Irvin Shorte shows the damage to his elbows from being dragged 100 yards behind his van

Horror: The 50-year-old had to be treated in hospital for eight hours following his ordeal

The 50-year-old suffered multiple cuts and bruises as well as internal bleeding, but managed to free himself when the van rounded a corner.

He had been fitting the Renault van with a satnav and Bluetooth technology, and left the keys in the ignition while he was working in the back.

Police quickly recovered the van following the incident in Cottingley, a suburb of Leeds, earlier this month, but they are still hunting for the hijacker who risked Mr Shorte's life.

'It was terrifying,' the married father of three said. 'It all happened in a flash, one minute I was fishing out some electrical wires in the back of the van and the next I was being pulled along at high speed.

At work: Mr Shorte was fitting a satnav to a van when it was suddenly hijacked by thieves

Cut: The electrician says he could have been much more badly hurt if not for his steel-capped boots

'I was shouting at the driver to stop but he didn't care. I don't know if he knew I was there to begin with but he soon did, and wasn't at all bothered about slowing down.

'Things were flying out of the back of the van and hitting me but all I could do was hold on for dear life.'

Mr Shorte was treated at Leeds General Infirmary for eight hours following the terrifying incident.

'It could have been so much worse,' he said. 'There were moments where I was fearing for my life, but I have to thank my boots which were new on that day.

Anger: Mr Shorte has urged police to track down the culprits so that it does not happen to anyone else

'They were completely worn down by the end of it, but without them I wouldn't have had any control, and I could have been killed.

'I only got away when he flew round a corner and I managed to jerk my hand free. I spun off after hitting the other door and hit the kerb.'

The van, which was fitted with a tracking device, was found abandoned near where it was stolen, and Mr Shorte has urged police to find the culprit.

'Hopefully the police will catch the low-life, as other people could easily come off a lot worse,' he said. 'He has no regard for anyone's safety.'
