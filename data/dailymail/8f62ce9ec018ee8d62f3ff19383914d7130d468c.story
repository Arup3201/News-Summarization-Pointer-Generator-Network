Anni Dewani's sister has paid an emotional tribute to her murdered sibling, calling her 'the best sister anybody could wish for' as a South African judge cleared Shrien Dewani of murder.

Remembered for her light-hearted and sunny nature, Anni was able to 'see the positive thing in every person', her sister Ami Denborg said, adding that she misses hearing her voice - a sound so familiar from the sisters' childhood in the small town of Mariestad in Sweden.

Anni, a 28-year-old engineering graduate, moved to the UK in 2010 to help her millionaire soon-to-be husband Shrien run his PSP Healthcare nursing home business in Bristol, with her good looks inspiring her to apply for the city's 'Top Model' competition under her maiden name Hindocha.

Just a few months later she was dead - murdered in a poverty-stricken Cape Town neighbourhood just days after the couple's lavish £200,000 wedding in Mumbai.

Anni was found shot through the neck in the back of a taxi which had been hijacked after the couple hired a local driver to show them the 'real Africa'.  

This morning Shrien Dewani was dramatically cleared of any part in the honeymoon murder after a judge threw out the case against him - saying the testimony of the prosecution's 'star' witness had been 'riddled with contradictions'.

Taxi driver Zola Tongo was jailed for 18 years over Anni's killing in December 2010. Two other men - Mzwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni - were each jailed for 25 years in 2012 and last November respectively, with Mngeni later dying of brain cancer in October of this year.

Best friends: Describing Anni's personality, Ami Denborg (pictured right alongside her sister) said: 'She had the biggest loving heart for her family and friends... She was always happy, always smiling, she loved life'

Describing her sister's personality, Mrs Denborg, 37, said: 'She had the biggest loving heart for her family and friends...She was always happy, always smiling, she loved life, she was very joyful.' 

'She was one of a kind. She used to look up to me a lot and that's what I miss about her. She would always give everyone compliments,' Mrs Denborg added.

The engineer said the quality most people remember about Anni was her ability to see the positive in every person and every situation and could always make people feel good about themselves.

'She just loved the family, she loved people and she would always tell people how good they were.

'Anni looked up to me, but my relationship with her was that she was my best friend. We could talk about anything. I wouldn't see her as my little sister, even though she was five years younger than me,' Mrs Denborg said.

'We were very, very close as sisters and I would say she was my best friend. I miss her terribly,' she went on to say.

Following this morning's  verdict, Anni's sister bravely spoke on the steps of the court room within minutes of the judgment.

'We've heard that Shrien left a double life and Anni wasn't aware of it, ' she said, as her father Vinod laid his face on his son Anish's shoulder as he wept, his face crumpled, his tears falling onto his son's suit. Anish also wept, he has been in court every minute of the 25 days of the trial, supporting his parents. His mother, Nilam, was silent in her grief, her face wet with tears.

Finally, her voice cracking with emotion, Mrs Denborg summed up the devastation felt by her family, 'We can here for the truth, seeking answers but are led twitch so many unanswered questions, its a very sad day and believe that justice has failed us.'

Anni's uncle Ashok said: 'The decision to end the trial without the defendant offering a defence, means we, and the good people of South Africa, the UK and various parts of the world who have followed the case, will always live without ever knowing the complete events that led up to Anni's death.'

Judge Jeannette Traverso said that prosecutors arguments had 'fallen far below' the level needed to secure conviction. She attacked the prosecution's chief witness for giving testimony of such 'poor quality' she did not know where the 'lies end and truth begins'.

Before her savage murder in a run-down Cape Town neighborhood just days after her 'fairy-tale' Hindu wedding to husband Shrien, Anni hoped her modelling career would flourish in the UK.

In the years before her death Anni had moved from her hometown Mariestad to study engineering at the Univesity of Gävle in northern Sweden before relocating again to work for the mobile phone company Eriksson in Stockholm. 

It was while she was living in the Swedish capital that she decided she wanted to spent more time in the UK.

Anni initially stayed with her cousin Sneha in Luton in mid-2009, where she met Shrien Dewani through mutual friends. On their first proper date the couple went to watch a production of The Lion King at the Lyceum Theatre in London's West End.

Within a few months the couple were alternating their weekends between Bristol, where Shrien lived and worked, and Stockholm, where Anni was still based.

With the couple now engaged, Anni decided that she would move to Bristol on a permanent basis the following month to help her husband run his PSP Healthcare nursing home business. Shortly after arriving, Anni entered Bristol's Top Model competition under her maiden name Hindocha.

As with every else in their fast-moving relationship, the couple did not wait long to get married - inviting 500 guests to a lavish three-day Hindu ceremony in Mumbai on October 29, 2010.

They planned to host a second civil ceremony in Bristol the following year for friends who had been unable to make the journey to India.

Anni's father Vinod has subsequently described the ceremony as 'a drama and false' and said he had largely paid for it. 

In a recent interview with MailOnline, Mr Hindocha revealed revealed that he and his wife Nilam will sue their son-in-law for not disclosing his bisexuality before marrying their daughter - and hope to receive at least partial compensation for the expense of the wedding.

Anni and Shrien set off on their honeymoon in South Africa shortly after their wedding, arriving at Cape Town International Airport on November 7.

Following a short internal flight, the newlyweds spent four nights staying at the Kruger National Park, before returning to Cape Town on November 12.

It was on the drive from Cape Town International Airport to their room at five-star Cape Grace Hotel that the pair first encountered taxi driver Zola Tongo.

After dinner the pair once again set off in Tongo's Volkswagen Sharan - this time to see the 'real Africa' on the a guided tour of Cape Town's poverty-stricken Gugulethu township.

Within minutes the car was hijacked by two armed men and driven for what Shrien claims was roughly 20 minutes - taking the couple 20 minutes from the kidnapping site.

It was at this point Shrien says he was thrown from the back of the moving vehicle. He subsequently flagged down a passing car and contacted the police.

The vehicle was found two miles from the scene with Anni dead in the back of the taxi, severely beaten and bruised and suffering a single gunshot wound to the neck.

Three men have already been convicted of their role in the killing of Anni Dewani - including cab driver Zola Tongo, who is serving an 18-year jail term.

Prosecutors say bisexual Shrien wanted out of the relationship and plotted for Anni to be killed in an apparent botched hijacking.

But Dewani, 34, has always denied any involvement in the plot.

Dewani, from Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol, was charged with murder, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, kidnapping, and defeating the ends of justice.

His lawyers last month applied for Judge Traverso to dismiss the case - although they have refused to confirm if Dewani would be free to return to the UK immediately.
