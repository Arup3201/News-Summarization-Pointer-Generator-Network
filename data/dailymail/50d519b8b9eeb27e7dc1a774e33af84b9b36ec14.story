A Swiss father-of-three is being interviewed by police today after it emerged he was the mystery man seen driving from the camping ground with a girl who looked like Maddie McCann days after she vanished in 2007.

Karsten Mayer, 41, is a German-speaking Swiss native who lives near the capital Bern whose own daughter was in the family car and who, he says, was mistaken for the missing toddler by a British eyewitness.

The potential sighting came three days after Madeleine was abducted from Praia da Luz in Portugal, a few hours drive away.

Sighting: A blonde girl identical to Madeleine McCann was supposedly seen with a 
German family at the Cabopino campsite on Spain's Costa del Sol 
(pictured) just three days after the British toddler went missing five 
years ago

It emerged yesterday that British detectives investigating her disappearance have been told a German family paid extra after arriving at the campsite with one more child than expected on May 6, 2007, according to The Sun.

But Mr Mayer, who was spotted with the blonde girl, has since insisted the youngster was not Madeleine, and was infact his own daughter.

Mr Mayer also pledged to speak to police to clear himself of any connection to missing Madeleine following the media reports yesterday.

Missing: Madeleine was abducted from Praia da Luz in Portugal, a few hours drive away from the Spanish campsite, in May 2007

'I am turning myself over to police,' said Mr Mayer, a self employed businessman, 'before these media reports get me arrested.'

He told Blick, Switzerland's biggest 
daily paper; 'I did have a girl around about Maddie's age in the car - 
she was my own daughter who also happens to have blonde coloured hair 
and was about the same age as Maddie at the time.'

Karen
 Sisson, 49, the British woman who reported the sighting to police, said
 the girl 'looked groggy' and seemingly 'alienated' from the family she 
was with. She said the car had German plates that began with BE.

But the BE registration for the town and district of Beckum in western Germany went out of use 38 years ago.

Journalists in Switzerland used the 
number of the car to trace Mr Mayer to his home near Bern - BE standing 
for cars registered to the city and surrounding area.

Mr Mayer added; 'I was at the camping ground with my family. It is really unbelievable that I am some kind of suspect because we read about Maddie's disappearance on a notice at the campsite. We were shocked and we felt for the parents.

'It is quite possible that my daughter appeared distant. She was tired after a very long road trip.

The blonde girl was said to be with a German family driving a Mercedes Vito people carrier (pictured) that was first manufactured in 1996

'We spent 12 days at the camping ground we journeyed further around Portugal. I don't think a kidnapper would have done that.

'I find these media reports about me unbelievable and am reporting to police immediately before I am arrested!'

CID officers in Bern say that he has already 'all but' been ruled out of enquiries.
