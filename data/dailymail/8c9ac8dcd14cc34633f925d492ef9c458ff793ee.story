A 50-year inheritance battle over a £2million house bought after the sale of a Cornish Riviera hotel ended today after a senior judge ruled it belongs to the daughter of an alleged mistress.

Businessman Albert Line died in 1961 but his child Dr Kathleen Baker, 72, has claimed since then that her family's rightful inheritance is in the wrong hands.

She and her sister Margaret have been at loggerheads with 71-year-old Audrey Line, the current 
owner of Harrogate House, in Falmouth, insisting that she is entitled to
 a share of the historic house.

The property, designed by renowned architect,
 Alfred Cornelius, in the 1920s, was bought after a nearby seaside hotel that once belonged to Mr Line was sold after his death.

Baker has argued that Mrs Line's mother could not have been her father's lover as he was impotent, and deserves a share of the house.

But the 'extraordinary saga' was today 
brought to a halt by Judge Kevin Prosser QC, who ruled that 
she and her sister 'have no beneficial interest 
whatsoever in Harrogate House'.

It is likely to be the final twist in the battle that has cost Dr Baker hundreds of thousands of pounds in legal fees.

Huge legal bill: Dr Kathleen Baker, 72, who has spent 50 years fighting with another pensioner and has now lost

Her father Albert ran and owned a hotel in the town with Miss Line’s mother Norah Duff, with whom he was said to be having an affair in the 1950s.

Since his death in 1961, the pair’s respective daughters have been at loggerheads over who was due what share of the property.

The court heard the row has led to a series of alleged incidents including Miss Line being arrested for unfounded fraud allegations, and Dr Baker ‘rampaging’ through the hotel.

Dr Baker’s father and Norah had set up a company together to run the Palm Beach Hotel in Falmouth.

But a year after his death, his share of the hotel was transferred to her, making her the owner.

She later transferred the ownership to her daughter Audrey, who sold the Palm Beach and bought Harrogate House, a 1920s property that was designed by renowned Cornish architect Alfred Cornelius and overlooks Gyllyngvase Beach.

Dr Baker denied that her father was having an affair and has said that the transfer of his share of the hotel was invalid.

Miss Line, 71, said Dr Baker was ‘in denial’ and was trying to make her homeless.

Her lawyer, Guy Adams, told the court the battle stemmed from Dr Baker’s ‘unsubstantiated suspicions’ about the administration of her father’s estate in the early 1960s.

Dr Baker said her father, who amassed his wealth through timber and construction firms, remained faithful to her mother, Phyllis.

She claimed he regarded Norah as an employee and was planning on ‘asking her to go’.

Dr Baker, who is married, said he once poured slops into a shoe belonging to Norah, and asked: ‘Do you think I’d want to sleep with a woman like that?’

She also claimed that a second will that left her a quarter of his estate went missing.

Rejecting those arguments, however, Judge Prosser, said that, although there was a 'slightly odd' discrepancy in the shares transfer, there was nothing 'suspicious' about it.

The executors had handed the shares to Norah 'as part and parcel of an overall bargain' and after taking professional legal advice, he said.

They had not breached their duties and the transfer was 'for a proper purpose' bound up with the administration of Albert's estate.

There was no evidence of any 'deliberate concealment' of evidence by Audrey and Dr Baker, who lives near Colchester, and her sister had in any event launched their court action too late, the judge ruled.

Dr Baker had told the court that, during his lifetime, her father had always told her that the Palm Beach would be 'her portion' after his death.

But Mr Adams had pleaded with the judge 'to put an end to this extraordinary saga'.

Doing just that, Judge Prosser concluded: 'In the light of my conclusions on the merits, I will make a declaration that Dr Baker and Mrs Gardner have no beneficial interest whatsoever in Harrogate House'.
