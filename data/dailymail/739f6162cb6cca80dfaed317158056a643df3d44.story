He was the chairman of the Federal Reserve until the start of this year.

But even Ben Bernanke is having trouble refinancing his own home loan.

Speaking a conference in Chicago yesterday, the American economist said: 'I recently tried to refinance my mortgage and I was unsuccessful in doing so.

When the audience laughed, he added: 'I'm not making that up.'

Bernanke, 60, made the remarks on lending restrictions to moderator Mark Zandi, of Moody's Analytics Inc, at the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care conference.

During the discussion, he addressed the tightening of such restrictions by banks and regulators following the financial meltdown and Great Recession. 

He said he thought it was 'entirely possible' that lenders 'may have gone a little bit too far on mortgage credit conditions', according to Bloomberg News.  

He added that the first-time home buyer market is 'not what it should be', with housing the 'one area where regulation has not yet got it right' in a recovering economy.

Bernanke, who was paid $199,700 as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last year, purchased his three-bedroom Capitol Hill home for $839,000 in 2004, public records show.

Since then, he and his wife Anna have refinanced the home twice - with one occasion being in October 2009, when they took out a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage of $685,385.

The other was in September 2011, when they reportedly took out a $672,000, 30-year, fixed-rate loan at 4.25 per cent. 

Bernanke, who recently joined the Brookings Institution as a distinguished fellow, is currently commanding as much as $250,000 per speech, according to reports seen by CNN. 

The American economist (pictured delivering his first economic report to Congress in 2006) said he thought it was 'entirely possible' that lenders 'may have gone a little bit too far on mortgage credit conditions'

He is also reported to have a $1million book deal.  

Although is not clear why he has not been able to refinance his home again, one possibility could be that that his new, irregular income is more difficult to verify that his previous salary.

It is also possible that his recent change of jobs has made him a steeper credit risk in the automated world of mortgage finance.
