When former chef Glen Battensby lost almost half his body weight by swapping his diet of fast food for a healthy one, he was delighted.

But now his joy has been cut short because he can't get rid of the excess skin his weight loss has left behind.

Glen, 55, was hoping that the NHS would pay for surgery to remove the skin but he has been told there is no money available for the operation.

Glenn Battensby is half the man he used to be after shedding 11 stone, but has now been left with one stone of spare skin

Glen spent years as a chef preparing meals at restaurants in Leeds but his problems didn't start until he became a disc jockey more than 20 years ago and would eat burgers for dinner

'I was delighted when I lost the weight but then I have been left in tears and depressed because of what the dieting has left behind,' said Glen, who went down from 21st to 11st 10lbs in 18 months.

'It's alright when I am wearing clothes but it looks terrible when I strip off at the gym or to go swimming.'

Glen, from Leeds, West Yorks, spent years as a chef preparing meals at restaurants in Leeds but his problems didn't start until he became a disc jockey more than 20 years ago.

'It was a case of finishing work in the early hours and then going for a kebab or a burger,' he said.

'After a while the pounds just started piling on and it left me a physical wreck.'

The fat laden fast food meant Glen, who is not married, suffered diabetes, high blood pressure and thyroid problems.

'My health was so bad that I could hardly climb the stairs at home and I was wheezing and out of breath,' he said, adding: 'My weight wasn't caused by medical problems but by my lifestyle.'

At one stage while he was under the care of a hospital dietician he was told he could have a gastric band if he lost two stone.

'I lost the weight and they wouldn't give me the band because I had managed to lose the weight by dieting.'

Now Glen has kept to his strict diet but is angry that the NHS can't help him further.

'The skin left behind after dieting looks ugly and it makes me depressed thinking that I can not have surgery to remove it. Sometimes I end up in tears.'

He said he was so large that he found he hard to walk up stairs so completely changed his lifestyle

The DJ cannot understand how other 
people can get cosmetic surgery, including women who have their breasts 
enlarged or reduced using public funds.

An
aspiring glamour model who had a £4,800 tax payer funded breast 
enlargement surgery in Leeds now plans to sue the NHS for making them 
too big.

Josie Cunningham went from a size 32A to a 36DD following the surgery at St James' Hospital in Leeds in January.

Despite speaking of her new-found 
confidence after the operation, the 23-year-old now says she was rushed 
through the surgery and is seeking compensation for clinical negligence 
and emotional distress.

Glen said: 'How can women get cosmetic surgery on the NHS but I can't.

'I have spoken to my doctor but I was told they didn't have the money for the surgery.

'It was great to lose all that fat but now I depressed because of it.'

In a bid to keep his weight down 
Glen stays off the kebabs and burgers but as a former chef, he still 
makes them for party nights when he DJs.

He also spends much of his time baking cakes for family friends but added: 'I love making them but I don't eat them.'

The NHS Clinical Commission said that Glen's treatment was 'not routinely funded' by the NHS.

Requests for treatment have to be supported by clinical evidence and referred to a panel and they make the funding decision.

The NHS only pays for certain cosmetic procedures which can include nose reshaping if someone is having breathing problems, the surgical correction of ears that stick out for under 16s and breast reduction for women if the weight of the patient's breasts is causing back problems.
