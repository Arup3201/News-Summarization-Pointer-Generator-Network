The family of kosher supermarket jihadist Amedy Coulibaly have condemned the attacks in Paris and offered their condolences to the victims.

Gunman Coulibaly died in a hail of bullets when armed police stormed the Hyper Cacher grocery, where he had held terrified staff and shoppers hostage.

Four hostages were shot dead in the seige, which came the day after 32-year-old Coulibaly murdered a policewoman in Montrouge, to the south of the French capital.

The family of kosher supermarket jihadist Amedy Coulibaly, shown here in a 'suicide' video, have condemned the attacks in Paris and offered their condolences to the victims' families

Now his mother and sisters have spoken out against the attacks, saying they offer their 'sincere condolences' to the families of those killed.

'We condemn these acts,' they said in a statement. 

'We absolutely do not share these extreme ideas. We hope there will not be any confusion between these odious acts and the Muslim religion.'

Coulibaly had threatened to kill his hostages if police attempted to storm the Charlie Hebdo terrorists Cherif and Said Kouachi who, at the time, were engaged in a similar standoff with police.

Cherif Kouachi's wife, who was held for 72 hours after the Charlie Hebdo attack, has also condemned the killings, according to one of her lawyers.

Lawyer Christian Saint-Palais said the woman had 'the same reaction to the rest of the national community' to the shootings, which had left her 'stunned'.

He said she had also expressed her sympathy for the victims, and had been unaware of her husband's terrorist plans.

In the hours after the dramatic raid on the store, an Israeli government official said 15 hostages were rescued while French president Francois Hollande confirmed that four people were killed.

They were later named as Yohan Cohen, 22, Yoav Hattab, 21 Philippe Braham, in his forties, and François-Michel Saada, thought to be in his sixties. 

Coulibaly was also responsible for the fatal shooting of 27-year-old policewoman Clarissa Jean-Philippe on Thursday. It has now been suggested this attack may have been an aborted attempt to attack a Jewish school.

In an apparent suicide video which emerged today, Coulibaly confirmed his links to the Kouchi brothers, and pledged his allegiance to Islamic State

In a telephone interview with television station BFM from inside the grocery store, Coulibaly explained that he and the Kouachis 'synchronized the operations' and that while the brothers attacked Charlie Hebdo, 'I started to do the police.' 

In an apparent suicide video which emerged today, Coulibaly confirmed his links to the brothers, saying: 'The brothers of our team, they did Charlie Hebdo.

'I also went out a bit against the police so that it has more impact. We managed to synchronise to come out at the same time.'

'What we have done is completely legitimate given what they have done. If you attack the caliphate, we will attack you.'

Along with the Kouachi brothers, Coulibaly was part of the so-called Buttes-Chaumont network that helped send jihadists to Iraq to fight for al-Qaeda.

Like Cherif Kouachi, Coulibaly was named in connection with a 2010 plot to help fellow Islamist, Smain Ait Ali Belkacem, who bombed the Paris metro in 1995, injuring 30 people, escape from prison.

Coulibaly was jailed for five years for his part in the plot, but was released from jail two months ago.

Authorities are still searching for Coulibaly's widow, Hayat Boumeddiene, 26, who is described as an 'armed and dangerous' suspect. She once posed for a photo holding a crossbow in her Islamic veil, and is wanted by French police for helping Coulibaly prepare terrorist acts.
