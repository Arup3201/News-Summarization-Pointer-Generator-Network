The BBC was late to realise it had a shortage of older women on screen, one of its top executives has admitted.

Fran Unsworth, deputy director of BBC news and current affairs, said that until recently the corporation believed viewers preferred to see younger women on TV – but insisted it has ‘attempted to address’ the shortage of older female presenters.

Miss Unsworth was challenged by the Lords Communications Committee about the lack of older women on screen.

Deputy director of BBC news and current affairs Fran Unsworth, who says the corporation has attempted to address the shortage of older female presenters on TV 

Crossbench peer Baroness Deech said there is no female equivalent to veteran host David Dimbleby, 76, adding: ‘I haven’t seen a white-haired woman of 76 on television ever ... you only see these model types on television.’

Miss Unsworth said there are not very many older men on our screens either, and claimed Dimbleby, Today programme presenter John Humphrys, 71, and war correspondent John Simpson, 70, are the few exceptions.

She also said there are ‘considerable numbers’ of women in their fifties working in television, including journalists Bridget Kendall, 58, and Lyse Doucet, 55.

Miss Unsworth also said that there are not many older men on TV either and that David Dimbleby, left, and John Simpson, right, are the few exceptions 

But she conceded the BBC had been ‘late to the party’ on the issue of age discrimination, adding: ‘It would be foolish of me to say there wasn’t something in what you’re saying. This a subject we have only woken up to in that respect in the last few years.’

She added: ‘I don’t think it is an audience preference. We’ve only in the last few years taken that on board and attempted to address it. You have to see how the existing generation develop and how they want to develop their careers.

‘If you look at what John Simpson does, there aren’t many people who want to run round Afghanistan in their seventies.’

In 2009, the BBC lost a landmark age-discrimination case against Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly 

Figures released last year by Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman suggest women disappear from TV screens as they get older.

The findings showed that while 53 per cent of over-50s in the UK are women, the 82 per cent of TV presenters who are over 50 are men.

In 2009, the BBC lost a landmark age-discrimination case against presenter Miriam O’Reilly after she was dropped from rural affairs show Countryfile at the age of 52.
