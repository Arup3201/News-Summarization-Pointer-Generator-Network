Under attack: Clegg's 72-hour U-turn has drawn criticism from both his Conservative colleagues and his own party

Nick Clegg is under attack from the 
Tories and even his own party after performing a 72-hour 
U-turn on the Government’s flagship education policy.

The Deputy Prime Minister was accused by one Government source of attempting to cling on to ‘chauffeurs and people greasing up to him’ by pandering to Labour in the hope of keeping his job in a Lib-Lab coalition after 2015.

In the strongest condemnation of Mr Clegg since the coalition was formed, the source said his name had ‘become a byword for cheap sanctimony, opportunism, gimmicks and lying’.

Jeremy Browne, the former Lib Dem Home Office minister, insisted the free schools programme now being criticised by Mr Clegg was ‘liberal with a small “l”’ and should be supported.

Mr Clegg yesterday broke ranks with the Conservatives, declaring he will no longer support the fundamental principles of free schools, which have been set up by businesses, charities, religious organisations and groups of parents free from state control.

He said he disagreed with several of the most important freedoms exercised by free school heads, including their power to set their own curriculum and hire teachers without union-recognised qualifications.

Incredibly, his remarks came days after Lib Dem education minister David Laws enthusiastically praised the scheme, which has been largely opposed by Labour, in the Commons. Last Thursday, Mr Laws suggested the freedom to hire who they wanted had allowed free schools to take on ‘superb’ staff.

But Mr Clegg suggested that the Lib Dem manifesto for the 2015 election will include a ‘parental guarantee’ that children in all schools are taught by qualified teachers, follow the national curriculum, and receive high-standard school meals.

Mr Clegg said that the Tories are failing to apply the ‘minimum amount of basic standards’ to free schools by allowing them to employ whoever they want.

He is expected to expand on the 
remarks in a speech on Thursday in which he will criticise the Tory 
‘ideology’ which he says means free schools and academies have too much 
freedom.

The Deputy Prime Minister admitted 
that his words on free schools contradict current Government policies, 
but claimed the difference was not damaging. ‘It’s an open, grown-up 
difference. It’s not a crisis,’ he said.

One
Government source said: ‘It's no surprise that Nick Clegg - a man whose
name is a byword for cheap sanctimony, opportunism, gimmicks and lying -
wants to grab back power for MPs to meddle in schools.

‘Michael
Gove has pushed through academies to embed state schools' independence 
from the meddling of MPs like Clegg - so he will never accept Clegg's 
latest stunt as a serious policy.

'All
Clegg ever cares about in meetings is politics - never policy. He loves
the chauffeurs and people greasing up to him and he will try anything 
to cling onto a cushy job if Miliband wins. But whenever he promises 
anything, people should just think - how much was his cast iron promise 
on tuition fees worth?'

Conservative
planning minister Nick Boles, meanwhile, suggested Mr Clegg was a 
hypocrite because he did not want state schools to have the same 
freedoms enjoyed by his expensive private alma mater, Westminster 
School.

‘Clegg thinks that 
the freedoms enjoyed by his old school are too good for free schools. 
Don't look to Lib Dems to defend your freedoms, folks,’ he said.

Mr Boles added that Mr Clegg, who sacked Mr Browne earlier this month to the dismay of those on the Right of his party, said the Deputy Prime Minister was ‘rejecting true Liberals’.

Mr Browne, appearing on the BBC’s Sunday Politics programme, suggested that Mr Clegg was trying to distance the Lib Dems from some parts of the coalition agenda in order to appeal to left-leaning voters and party activists.

‘I support free schools. Free schools is a small ‘l’ liberal policy. I don’t want us to feel that we have to echo the policy positions of the Labour left… and crave the approval of columnists like Polly Toynbee [of the Guardian].

‘I don’t want us to be a pale imitation of the Labour Party, I think we should be a proud and unambiguously liberal party.

‘If we look like a party that is uneasy and ambivalent about our role in government, people won’t give us credit for the successes of the government and we won’t be able to claim the authorship that we should be able to claim for our policy successes in government.’

Out of step: Clegg's outburst comes just a couple of days after Lib Dem education minister David Laws praised the scheme in the Commons last Thursday

Richard Cairns, headmaster of the independent Brighton College,  said: ‘I strongly believe that teachers are born not made and I will actively seek out teachers from all walks of life who have the potential to inspire children.

‘We have 39 teachers without formal teaching qualifications, including me. Some have come straight from university: our History and politics department has three recent graduates, all with Firsts from Oxford or Cambridge and all excellent teachers. Others have come from other careers: an investment analyst, a lawyer, a management consultant, a nuclear physicist and someone from the BBC.’

Langley Free School appointed a professional actor as a drama teacher, and a professional singer for music, while West London Free School has appointed the former head of classics at a renowned independent school, as its classics teacher. They have also appointed an artist with several degrees as an art teacher.

Education minister Liz Truss said it was a ‘shame’ some Lib Dems did not back free schools and suggested Mr Clegg was pretending to be opposed to elements of the programme to appease left-wing activists.

She said the ‘whole point’ of the schools was ‘that hey have these freedoms... that's what's helping them outperform maintained schools’.

‘You shouldn't kill of the goose that's laid the golden egg,’ she added.

Tristram Hunt, Labour's Shadow Education Secretary, said: ‘Michael Gove and David Cameron's divisive free schools programme is unravelling for all to see. But Nick Clegg is locked in to this failure too. It is his policies that have led to the mess we saw at the Al-Madinah free school earlier, the looming crisis in teacher recruitment and the 141 per cent rise in unqualified teachers since 2010.

‘What is clear is that Labour's policies of ensuring that all teachers should be qualified and that schools are subject to proper local oversight are the right ones for educating our children.’

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Free schools are raising standards and giving parents more choice. They are run by teachers – not local bureaucrats or Westminster politicians – and are free to set their own curriculum, decide how they spend their money and employ who they think are the best people for the job. This Government is not going to take these freedoms away.

‘Independent schools have always been able to hire brilliant people who have not got qualified teacher status. Free schools and academies now have the same freedoms as independent schools to hire great linguists, computer scientists, engineers and other specialists so they can inspire their pupils.’
