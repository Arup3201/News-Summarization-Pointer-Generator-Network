Jailed: Earle was sentenced to six years on Tuesday for brutal attack on his ex-girlfriend Cheryl Thrower

A jilted lover has been jailed for six years after he 'snapped' and brutally stabbed his ex-partner - with a potato peeler.

Care home worker Steven Earle, 53, attacked Cheryl Thrower, 55, as she went to make coffee at the home they had shared in Kettering, Northamptonshire.

A court heard the couple - who met at a residential home where they both worked - had been together for six years and had been on good terms since their break-up.

But the dad-of-two said he 'just snapped' and stabbed his former girlfriend with the six inch kitchen utensil as he visited the property to discuss dividing up their belongings on August 28.

After the unprovoked assault, Earle called an ambulance himself and told police they could find him at a nearby community centre.

Police arrived at the scene to find Miss Thrower lying in a pool of blood from a stab wound to her lower back and another which punctured her abdomen.

She was rushed to Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry where medics discovered one of the injuries had caused a small laceration to her kidney.

On Tuesday Earle admitted wounding with intent when he appeared at Northampton Crown Court.

Jailing him for six years and four months, Judge Rupert Mayo said: 'You have admitted a serious assault on your partner of six years.

'You used a weapon to inflict these injuries. While short-lived, this was a sustained and repeated assault on the same person.'

The court heard Earle launched his vicious assault despite their amicable split earlier this year.

No excuse: Earle admitted his vicious assault and even telephoned the police himself to tell them where they could find him

Assault: Judge Rupert Mayo called Earle's attack on Miss Thrower 'serious' and 'sustained' and jailed him for six years and four months

Prosecutor Neil Bannister said Miss Thrower attempted to stem the blood flow by using a tea towel.

He said: 'She grabbed a kitchen towel as she was starting to bleed quite heavily.

'Police noticed a great deal of blood on the carpet.

'The defendant called the police and he made admissions as to stabbing his partner.

'He said he just snapped.'

Miss Thrower was discharged from hospital four days later.

Earle, who had no previous convictions, was described in character references as 'hard-working, reliable and honest.'

He was given credit by the judge for for having led a 'useful life' in bringing up his two children on his own, for the remorse shown and for calling the emergency services himself.

He is expected to serve up to half the sentence in custody before being released on licence.Â
