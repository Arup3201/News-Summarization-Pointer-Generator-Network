An ex-Lehman Brothers hotshot is accused of biting, kicking and pulling the hair of his estranged wife inside their lavish Manhattan co-op.

David Milberg, 50, who was vice president at the failed bank and now runs a private investment firm, is set to go on trial for attempted assault after the alleged April 1 incident, which the mother of his three children says involved him using 'both of his hands to forcefully push me onto a chair... causing bruising and substantial pain.'

Melinda Milberg, 50, told authorities she 'then observed (my husband) grab me by the hair and strike my head against the chair multiple times... causing my hair to come out of my head.'

According to Mr Milberg's lawyer, Robert Gottlieb, prosecutors dropped the charges from an A misdemeanor to a B misdemeanor Monday to force a bench trial, while he had been fighting for the higher charges so a jury would hear the case.

The banker allegedly admitted to police as he was arrested that he 'bit her arm' but insisted 'I fell into a trap. This is what she wanted.'

The couple had split in January and Mrs Milberg officially filed for divorce in March but were taking turns living in the Upper West Side pad with the children until April. When not with the kids, the other spouse would live in a hotel, Mr Gottlieb told MailOnline.

He said that on April 1, Mr Milberg had returned to his home and told his wife he was fed up with the housing arrangement.

But Mr Milberg's lawyer insists his wife trumped up the accusations to win leverage in the couple's nasty, multimillion divorce case.

Mr Gottlieb told MailOnline: 'David is absolutely innocent of those absurd charges. This case is simply about a woman who has manipulated the police the District Attorney and is now trying to manipulate the courts for the sole purpose of getting money in the matrimonial case.'

He said the divorce proceedings started before Mr Milberg's arrest.

'These charges were just part of her strategy to gain leverage in her quest for money,' Mr Gottlieb said on Tuesday.

Mr Gottlieb would not say exactly how much Mrs Milberg was going for in the divorce but said it was a 'significant' sum, adding 'she has refused to settle it while the criminal case was pending.'

In the split, the couple are fighting over custody as well as access to a 400-acre country club - Sunningdale in Westchester, New York, of which they are members.

'Mrs Milberg's shenanigans and her abuse of the system has resulted in David having very little contact with the children,' Mr Gottlieb said. The kids are aged 14, 10 and eight.

David Aronson, Mr Milberg's divorce lawyer, told the New York Daily News the estranged couple could both be 'at the country club at the same time as long as Mr Milberg understands he has to stay away from his wife and not approach her and not speak to her.'

But Mrs Milberg's attorney told the newspaper that was inconceivable as the possibility of seeing their father at the posh club was 'really a frightening thought' to the couple's children.

Mr Milberg's trial will begin later this week.
