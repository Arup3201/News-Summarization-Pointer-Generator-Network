A U.S. man surprised his girlfriend with a marriage proposal amid a cloud of monarch butterflies in a wildlife sanctuary in central Mexico.

Samantha Goldberger set up a camera for a romantic Valentine's Day picture at the El Capulin reserve, near Zitacuaro, and was stunned when Jason Skipton dropped to one knee as the flash went off.

'This place is like a miracle. And it is a miraculous thing that took place with us,' Mr Skipton told Yahoo News.

'No one knows why the monarchs travel so far, or come here to find each other. It is inexplicable.'

He met Samantha, who happily said yes, on a chance encounter 2000km from his home and said he had butterflies in his stomach when he met her, so it was appropriate that he propose among butterflies that migrate thousands of miles to mate.

Every October and November millions of monarchs travel 3200km to central Mexico from Canada and the U.S.and hibernate in fire trees, before emerging in February to find a mate.

When the butterflies migrate to the reserve they congregate thickly on trees to conserve heat, open their wings to catch the sun's warming rays and at dawn take flight in their millions and mate.

With a wing span of four inches, the monarch butterfly is known for its lengthy migration and is the only butterfly species to make annual north-south migrations, like many bird species.

The monarch migrates from North America to central Mexico and back again each year. However, having a life span of only two months, it takes four generations to complete the round trip.

Mr Skipton's proposal is made all the more remarkable because it is in the state of Michoacan, gripped by violence between drug cartels and the authorities.

The U.S. Bureau of Consular Affairs has warned travellers against non-essential travel to most of the state of Michoacan.

According to the statistics last published by the Mexican government in late 2011, 47,515 people were killed in narcotics-related violence in Mexico between December 2006 and September 2011.
