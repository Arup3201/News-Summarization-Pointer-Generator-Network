Women 
believe actress Michelle Keegan has the perfect bikini body - while men 
prefer the curves of Kelly Brook, new research has revealed.

The poll found women admire former Coronation Street star Keegan, 27, for her slim, toned and balanced figure.

By contrast, men prefer the fuller hour-glass curves of model and ex-TV presenter Brook, 32.

However, Kelly Brook’s perfect bikini body is also admired by British women.

Despite currently being pregnant, This Morning and Celebrity Juice host Holly Willoughby is a favoured figure amongst men.

Other favourites include TV personality and model Myleene Klass and returning X Factor judge, Cheryl Cole.

And it seems both sexes are in agreement that Beyonce has a figure to be admired - with women voting her in third place whilst men ranked her as eighth.

The ideal dress size overall according to men would be a healthy size 12 while women, on the other hand, think a slightly smaller size 10 is the perfect dress size, found the survey by Swimwear365.

Despite her enviable physique, you won't find Michelle Keegan breaking a sweat in the gym or starving herself on a juice diet.

Speaking
 about her summer health regime, the star told 
MailOnline: 'I haven't had any time for exercise, I'm gutted. I feel so 
much better when I do work out.

'I don't believe in crash diets or detoxes, I can't live like that. If I have a bad day then I'll have a good day the next.'

Laidback life: Despite her enviable physique, you won't find Michelle Keegan breaking a sweat in the gym or starving herself on a juice diet. Here, the actress poses for her new Lipsy fashion campaign

Natural beauty: She said she doesn't like to feel as thought she's wearing a lot of make-up and just uses Simple face wipes to remove her make-up

The star, 
who shows off her enviable figure in her new Lipsy campaign, revealed 
that she tries to fit in 40 minute workouts but 'doesn't like the gym'.

When
 it comes to her diet, she isn't interested in sugary treats but has 
more of a 'savoury tooth' and loves crisps and sandwiches although, one 
look at her new Lipsy campaign, and you'd never guess.

She also prefers a more natural approach when it comes to her beauty regime.

'I don't like to feel like I wear a lot of make-up,' she told us. 'I just wash my face, use a light foundation such as Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation, some mascara, and lip balm. I love Benefit Hoola for giving me a healthy glow, too.'

The fashion designer also has a low maintenance approach when it comes to her skincare regime, using Simple face wipes to remove the day's make-up and moisturises with Origins products. She also swears by using Vaseline to lengthen her eyelashes.

Sharing her plans for the future, the actress, who is engaged to TOWIE boy Mark Wright, said: 'I've been so busy at auditions and meetings, I'm really trying to get back out there. I would also love to work in fashion and beauty, which is every girl's dream.

'In five year's time, which is a scary thought, I hope to be married with children and really happy in an acting job. Who knows...'
