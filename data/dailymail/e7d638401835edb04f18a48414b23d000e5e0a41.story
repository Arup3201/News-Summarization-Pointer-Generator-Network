All six Britons arrested by Russian authorities during a Greenpeace protest in the Arctic have been freed on bail after spending two months in detention.

Anthony Perrett, from Newport in south Wales, freelance journalist Kieron Bryan, Alexandra Harris from Exeter, Iain Rogers from Devon, Philip Ball from Oxford, and Frank Hewetson from London were among the so-called Arctic 30.

Their release followed a series of court hearings in St Petersburg.

Today a UN-mandated tribunal has ordered Russia to immediately release the Greenpeace ship and its crew in return for a 3.6 million euro (£3 million) bond.

The Hamburg-based International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled that 'the Russian Federation shall immediately release the vessel Arctic Sunrise and all persons who have been detained upon the posting of a bond or other financial security by the Netherlands'.

The tribunal also ordered Russia to allow the vessel and those detained to leave the country.

Mr Bryan and Ms Harris told how tough 
it had been when they were locked up after the Greenpeace vessel Arctic 
Sunrise was boarded by Russian security forces during a protest against 
oil drilling.

Ms Harris revealed she was kept in a cell on her own after being taken to a prison in Murmansk.

Tough: Mr Bryan said it had been 'tough' for the group, who were arrested two months ago

'For the first week it was really harsh. It was nerve-wracking,' she told BBC News immediately after being released.

'I was in a cell on my own. You do get used to it, but it was tough.'

Ms Harris said letters from supporters had kept her going.

Mr
Bryan said: 'More than anything, it's the isolation and not being able 
to speak to anyone, not being able to speak a common language. Being 
trapped in a cell for 24 hours a day is something I don't ever want to 
experience again, and there are a lot of people inside who have to carry
on doing that.

'My plan now
is to go to a hotel and have a long shower, leave my room whenever I 
want, never do another sudoku puzzle again, and speak to my family. 
That's the main plan.

'No 
idea about what happens next. I'm just focusing on getting through 
today, speaking to my family, and I'll deal with everything from then.'

Support: Mr Bryan hugs a supporter as he walks way from the building

After
watching the live pictures of Mr Bryan walking out of jail, his father 
Andy Bryan said: 'We're absolutely thrilled Kieron is out. He looks 
tremendously relieved, in good shape, and doesn't seem to have lost his 
sense of humour either.

'Now
we just can't wait to speak to him and then we'll hopefully be able to 
see him in person too. Of course, there are still these terrible charges
hanging over him. He feels a terrible injustice has been done but has 
also made it clear that he intends to clear his name.'

Mr
Perrett is a tree surgeon and director of a community interest company 
which encourages and supports the use of renewable energy.

He said the Arctic was where the battle to save the planet will be fought.

Friends
said he went to the Arctic driven by his belief that there are ways to 
live on this planet without destroying it. Before he left, he said he 
was nervous but not afraid of going on the trip.

The
30 were arrested during a protest against drilling in the Arctic and 
were initially held in Murmansk before being moved to St Petersburg.

They were charged with piracy but the authorities said this would be changed to hooliganism.

Greenpeace said the 30 had done nothing wrong, and the group has launched a worldwide campaign to have them freed.

Greenpeace
International Arctic campaigner Ben Ayliffe said: 'This will only 
really be over when he and the others are able to go home.

'For
now, we are allowing ourselves a sigh of relief, all the time 
remembering that those brave men and women are still charged with a 
crime they didn't commit, and of course our friend Colin was refused 
bail. This saga is far from over.

'The
detainees who were released yesterday slept well last night, though 
some of them stayed up late talking and talking, sharing experiences. 
They've been enjoying the taste of good food and the feel of thick 
mattresses, but they keep talking about Colin, asking when he'll be out,
and they don't yet know if they can go back home or if they'll have to 
stay in St Petersburg.'

Australian
Colin Russell, a radio engineer, who was refused bail earlier this 
week, is the only member of the Arctic 30 still being detained.
