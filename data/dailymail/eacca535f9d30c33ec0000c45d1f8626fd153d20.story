The man tipped to be the next U.S ambassador to London is married to the heiress of the Jack Daniels whiskey empire.

Matthew Barzun is rumoured to be the White House's choice to take one of the most prestigious jobs in American diplomacy. His wife, Brooke, is a member of the family that controls one of the world’s biggest drinks companies, Brown-Forman.

The Kentucky-based company has a turnover of £1.6billion and owns the Jack Daniel’s, Southern Comfort and Finlandia Vodka brands.

Matthew Barzun is expected to be appointed U.S. ambassador to the UK soon. His wife Brooke is the heiress of a major alcoholic drinks business

Mr Barzun, 42, is the former ambassador to Sweden and a key fundraiser for President Obama, having banked a million dollars from donors and serving as finance chairman for the re-election campaign.

Although the appointment to the Court of St James, which comes with occupancy of Winfield House in Regent’s Park, has not been formalised, but is expected to be announced soon, reports the Daily Telegraph.

Louis Susman, the current ambassador and a former fundraiser himself, will leave his post in early April.

The president has raised eyebrows with key diplomatic appointments going to supporters and fundraisers in the past. He appointed Dan Rooney, the owner of NFL team the Pittsburgh Steelers and a campaigner on Obama's behalf, to the role of U.S. ambassador to Ireland.

The London role was at one point expected to go to Anna Wintour, the British-born editor of U.S. Vogue.

Mr Barzun was raised in Massachusetts and educated at Harvard. He made his money with the gadget news and reviews website CNET, before starting his own consultancy for internet media firms.

He has supported the Democratic party from an early age and was a student intern for John Kerry in 1989.

The father-of-three can trace his family lineage back to John Winthrop, a wealthy English Puritan lawyer who was instrumental in the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the first major Pilgrim settlement after Plymouth Colony, and a leading light in the colonial movement.

Ironically, his puritan beliefs would likely have made him a keen opponent of alcohol.

The U.S. Embassy in London was not available for comment.
