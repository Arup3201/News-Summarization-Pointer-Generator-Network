China's richest man Wang Jianlin says it is easier to do business in Britain than America or the EU

China's richest man has announced he will be increasing his investments in the UK, claiming he finds it easier to do business in Britian than America or the EU.

Wang Jianlin, who is said to be worth around £13billion ($22billion), was speaking to reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

His conglomerate, the Dalian Wanda Group, last year bought British boat maker Sunseeker in a £320million deal and has announced plans for a five-star hotel and apartment complex on London's south bank.

In 2012, the firm snapped up the U.S. cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) for $2.6 billion deal.

And today they announced they are talks with the French Aviation firm Dassault.

Wang told CNN: 'If we compare [the United States and the European Union], the U.S. is more open than the EU. But the U.K. is the most open.'

The announcement will come as welcome news to British Prime Minister David Cameron who last year took some 131 representatives of businesses ranging from financial services to healthcare on a trade mission to China.

The trip reportedly resulted in over £5.6 billion ($9.3 billion) worth of trade deals between the two countries.

In September last year Dalian Wanda announced it was spending $8.2 billion to develop 'motion-picture city,' which Wang described as the biggest-ever single investment in the movie and television industry.

Last year Wang's conglomerate, the Dalian Wanda Group, bought Dorset-based boat builder Sunseeker in a £320million deal

When completed in 2017, the Oriental 
Movie Metropolis will boast of 20 sound stages, including the world's 
first underwater studio, a massive convention and exhibition complex, a 
sprawling shopping mall with an indoor amusement park and seven resort 
hotels.

The project also will include a yacht club with 300 berths.

Wanda Group, which is privately-held, has invested in 72 Wanda Plazas across China, along with 40 five-star hotels. The company also owns 6,000 movie screens, 62 department stores and 68 karaoke centres.

More recently, the company has turned to offshore markets to expand its real estate and leisure investment.

Shrewd move: British Prime Minister David Cameron prepares to jet off to China last year with 131 businesses representatives. The trip reportedly resulted in over £5.6 billion worth of deals between the two countries
