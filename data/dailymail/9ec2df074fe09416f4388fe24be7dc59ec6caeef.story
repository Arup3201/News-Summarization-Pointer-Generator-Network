Fresh off the back of winning its $1bn court battle against tech rival Samsung Electronics Ltd, Apple  is launching yet another lawsuit alleging further infringement.

Apple has asked a federal court in a separate case to find that four additional Samsung products, including the Galaxy S III, violate the tech giant's patents.

In February, Apple claimed that at least 17 Samsung products infringe its patents.

In a court filing made in San Jose federal court on Friday, Apple added four more products to the list of allegedly infringing products that have been released beginning in August 2011 and continuing through this month.

Fresh off the back of winning its $1bn court battle against tech rival Samsung Electronics Ltd, Apple Inc is launching yet another lawsuit alleging further infringement

Among the products named are the Galaxy S III, Samsung's flagship smartphone, and the Galaxy Note.

Apple won a major victory over Samsung last Friday in a separate case when a jury found that the South Korean company had copied critical features of the hugely popular iPhone and iPad and awarded the U.S. company $1.05 billion in damages.

Samsung representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Since Apple's victory in  proving Samsung did copy their smartphone technology Google chief Larry Page and Apple CEO Tim Cook have been locked in behind-the-scenes talks.

The two executives had a phone conversation last week, the sources said, amid speculation the search giant could be next in Apple's sights. Discussions involving lower-level officials of the two companies are also ongoing.

Last Friday, a jury awarded Apple the hefty sum of damages and set the stage for a possible ban on sales of some Samsung products, most of which use Google's Android software. 

Many have viewed the case as a 'proxy war' between Apple and Google. The Android software first came out on the market when Google's then-CEO Eric Schmidt was serving on the Apple board. 

The Associated Press reported that after shoving Schmidt off Apple's board, Steve Jobs vowed that Apple would resort to 'thermonuclear war' to destroy Android and its allies. He declared Android a 'stolen product'.

While Jobs is no longer at the helm of Apple and their ensuing legal battles, his determination to kill the Android software platform may be ingrained in the corporate mindset.

Page and Cook are expected to talk again in the coming weeks, though no firm date has been set, the sources said on Thursday.

One of the sources told Reuters that a meeting had been scheduled for this Friday, but had been delayed for reasons that were unclear.

Google was forced to issue a statement on Monday following the judge's ruling, to shareholders.

It said the portions of Samsung's smartphones which were found to be copied do not apply to their software. If that is the case, then Apple will have no case against Google.

'The court of appeals will review both infringement and the validity of the patent claims. Most of these don't relate to the core Android operating system, and several are being re-examined by the US Patent Office,' the statement said. 

Apple on Monday gave a federal judge a
 list of eight Samsung Electronics Co. products it wants pulled from 
shelves and banned from the U.S. market, including popular Galaxy model 
smartphones.

The products Apple wants out are all 
smartphones: Galaxy S 4G, Galaxy S2 AT&T, Galaxy S2, Galaxy S2 
T-Mobile, Galaxy S2 Epic 4G, Galaxy S Showcase, Droid Charge and Galaxy 
Prevail.

Last week a Californian court decided that Apple's 
iPad was copied by Samsung Electronics' Galaxy tablet 10.1 (right) and 
that the South Korean firm must pay over $1 billion in damages

The judge has scheduled a September 20 hearing to discuss Apple's demands for the sales bans.

One possible scenario under consideration could be a truce involving disputes over basic features and functions in the Android mobile software, one source said. The 'pinch-and-zoom' feature now used on most smartphones and tablets is particularly under threat following the patent infringement battle.

But it was unclear whether Page and Cook were discussing a broad settlement of the various disputes between the two companies, most of which involve the burgeoning mobile computing area, or are focused on a more limited set of issues.

Competition between Google and Apple has heated up in recent years with the shift from PCs to mobile devices.

The popularity of the software has 
been in tandem with tit-for-tat patent infringement lawsuits slung by both sides.

The
 latest complaint was filed by Motorola Mobility, now a unit of Google, 
against Apple at the U.S. International Trade Commission claiming some 
features of Apple's devices infringe on its patents.

Claims: Apple filed its lawsuit in April of last
 year alleging that 28 Samsung smartphones and computer tablets had 
'slavishly copied' the iPhones and iPads

A previous lawsuit between the two in a Chicago court was thrown out by a federal judge, who said neither side could prove damages.

Apple in recent months has moved to lessen its reliance on Google's products.

Apple recently unveiled its own mobile mapping software, replacing the Google product used in the iPhone, and said it would no longer offer Google's YouTube as a pre-loaded app in future versions of its iPhone.

Cook took the helm at Apple a year ago, and Page stepped into the top job at Google a few months before that.

The conversation between Page and Cook last week did not result in any formal agreement, but the two executives agreed to continue talking, according to one source.

Google's Larry Page, who sat out several public speaking engagements earlier this summer because of an unspecified medical condition affecting his voice, has continued to run Google's business.

Apple and Google declined to comment on any discussions.
