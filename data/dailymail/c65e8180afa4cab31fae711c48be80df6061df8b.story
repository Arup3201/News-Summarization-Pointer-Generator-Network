Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe, who is reported to be suffering from a series of health problems after having a heart attack 

Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe was last night reported to be at death's door after a series of health problems including a heart attack.

The 68-year-old serial killer, who murdered 13 women and tried to kill seven more, is said to be suffering a severe cough and struggling to eat and sleep at Broadmoor.

A source said: 'If he doesn't improve, he's not got long left'.

Sutcliffe was given 20 life sentences in 1981 for his killing spree between 1975 and 1980.

The killer used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England.

Sutcliffe, who believed he was on a 'mission from God' to kill sex workers, has now been locked up at the maximum security psychiatric hospital in Berkshire for 30 years.

He made a bid for freedom in 2010 but a judge ruled he should never be released and should die in custody.

Sutcliffe suffers from diabetes and his health started to deteriorate last year when he went to another hospital for a hernia operation.

He then suffered a heart attack due to the stress of the procedure, The Sun reported last night.

A source said the killer was now angry at Broadmoor staff as he had been waiting nearly two months to see a specialist about a hacking cough.

The unnamed source said: 'He's in a bad way due to this cough. It's extremely severe. He's having difficulty eating and sleeping, and if they don't do something about the cough, it could bring another heart attack.

'He's angry with the staff and said he can't go on much more.

'He knows that not taking his medication will cause his blood pressure to go up and he knows how dangerous that is. He's said I'm not well, I'm not good at the moment. He's complained dreadfully about things. He thinks they are just not bothered.'

The paper also said Sutcliffe had told a friend: 'Everything is being a struggle, even writing letters has been a big battle – everything's one big effort.

'The situation is bad. I have refused my medication yesterday and today.'

And speaking about his cough, the murderer said: 'It's doing me a lot of harm. My chest aches, it's no good for my heart with the angina, you know. When I am coughing, I'm not eating. It's horrible.'

A television documentary on the secure hospital was broadcast on Wednesday night, but paranoid schizophrenic Sutcliffe had declined to be involved.

The Sun's source also said Sutcliffe was staying in an individual room with a bed, access to email, a TV and desk he uses to write to penpals.

According to a source, Sutcliffe is staying in an individual room at Broadmoor, pictured, with a bed, access to email, a TV and a desk where he writes to penpals 

The source said: 'He gets at least 30 letters per week and has lots of visitors.'

It was also reported that Sutcliffe was now a Jehovah's Witness. The source said: 'He thinks that Armageddon will come and one day we will all live on paradise on Earth.

'He also thinks that when he dies all will be forgiven because he has faith and belief.'

A hospital spokesman said: 'Broadmoor Hospital will not comment on any matter that would breach our duty to maintain patient confidentiality.'
