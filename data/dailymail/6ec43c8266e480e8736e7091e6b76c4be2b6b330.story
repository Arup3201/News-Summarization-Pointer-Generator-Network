Manchester City’s finances are set for a boost after it emerged they are ready to renegotiate their current kit deal with sportswear giants Nike.

City still have three-years left on the deal - worth £12million a year – they signed almost three years ago but the club’s on-field success and off-field value has continued to grow since then and it is understood that both sides are now ready to get round the negotiating table again.

The Barclays Premier League champions will not be able to match the astronomical sums neighbours United rake in  – their deal with adidas which kicks in next season is worth £75m-a-year – but nevertheless City will expect to agree a significantly increased sum this time round.

Manchester City, who drew with Everton at the weekend thanks to a goal from Fernandinho (pictured celebrating) are close to beginning negotiations with sportswear giants Nike over a new kit deal

City currently rake in £12million a year from Nike and have three years left on their current contract

1) Arsenal - Puma (£30m a year) 

2) Chelsea - adidas (£30m a year)

3) Liverpool - Warrior (£25m a year) 

4) Manchester United - Nike (£20m a year*) 

5) Manchester City - Nike (£12m a year)

* Manchester United's association with Nike ends this year, with a £75m-a-year deal with adidas starting for the 2015-16 season 

Certainly it will be a surprise if City don’t manage to increase their deal to around the £20m mark and the fact that Nike have recently lost United and Arsenal from their Premier League cast list will only increase the US company’s determination to keep their most prominent remaining club happy.

Any hike in the deal would be welcome. 

City failed UEFA’s Financial Fair Play test last year and the make-up of the club’s parent company, City Football Group, is currently being looked into by European football’s governing body.

They were fined a record £50m for their FFP breaches, and their payment - along with Paris St Germain and Zenit St Petersburg, who also failed the fair play rules - will be shared out among the other clubs in the Champions League and Europa League.

Nike will be keen to keep City happy, as their 13-season sponsorship deal with United ends this year

Global sportswear brand Nike also had a deal with Arsenal, but lost out to Puma, who pay £30m a year

Their initial payments will total £20m, to be shared among the clubs who did comply with the rules last season, including Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea. 

On top of this, City's financial accounts are being scrutinised by UEFA, as revealed by Nick Harris in the Mail on Sunday.

It is being assessed whether an attempt has been made to mislead the European governing body over the full extent of the club's financial losses in 2013-14. 

UEFA are examining whether the creation of a set of subsidiary companies by City’s ‘parent’ company, City Football Group (CFG), allowed City to under-report the club’s losses.

Two particular subsidiary companies alone had costs, including wages, of £36.7million in the year to the end of May 2014, and posted combined losses of £25.9m in that period. Most of their business was done effectively on behalf of Manchester City FC in that period.
