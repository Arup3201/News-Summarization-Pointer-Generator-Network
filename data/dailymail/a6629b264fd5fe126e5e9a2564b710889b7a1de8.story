Aldi has unveiled its new back to school range, which is says is the nation's cheapest

Its growing success is all down to under-cutting rivals and now Aldi has done it again – this time with school uniforms.

The German discount retailer has unveiled its new back to school range, which it says is the country’s cheapest. Parents can pick up an entire uniform for just £4.

The move could start a back-to-school price war before the summer holidays have even begun. The range goes on sale next Thursday, July 24, and is expected to fly out of stores.

Trousers and skirts cost £1.50 each, a sweater or polo shirt is just £1.25 and shirts and blouses wil go for £1.25.

The range also extends to PE kits, padded coats, shoes, and even £6.95 football boots.

The price tags dramatically undercut the major supermarkets, Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s, which have prided themselves as champions of cost-conscious parents.

They have won big sales by beating mainstream clothing retailers of school uniforms, such as Marks & Spencer and specialist outfitters.

With the average cost of a full uniform said to range from £156 for primary schools to £285 for secondary schools in some areas, the supermarket offerings have been extraordinarily popular  with parents.

Aldi said the equivalent items in its £4 uniform would cost £6.75 at Tesco, £7.33 at Sainsbury’s and £7.50 at  Asda.

However, Sainsbury’s disputes this, saying that it charges £6.17 for the same three items. 

Unlike other retailers, Aldi has a flat price range across all sizes from ages four to 11.

A
 spokesman said the clothing was made in Bangladesh, adding: ‘We promote
 workplace practices and conditions that are safe, fair and legal for 
all those involved in making our products.’

The
 Aldi uniform is likely to appeal to the parents of fast-growing 
primary-school age children as generic grey, black and navy items are 
accepted at most schools.

However not all will be able to stock up.

Many head teachers demand that 
uniforms are specific to their schools with particular badges, colours 
or added logos and many schools have exclusive deals with specialist 
suppliers which mean uniforms can only be bought from one store.

Daisy
 Craydon, a mother-of-two who writes for parenting publication 
UKMums.TV, says she was pleasantly surprised by a sample of the new Aldi
 uniform.

The 29-year-old from Northampton said:
 'I was really impressed with it. The first thing that struck me was the
 low price but the high quality - especially the feel of the material.

The Aldi Specialbuy Back to School uniform - which costs just £4 for a sweater, two polo shirts and bottoms. The range, available for four to 11-year-olds, undercuts other supermarkets by up to 47 per cent

The range includes this unisex sweater (left) that comes in a number of colours and costs just £1.25. Parents will also be able to buy two polo shirts (right) for £1.25 when the range launches at the end of next month

Thrifty Aldi shoppers may also buy a pair of trousers or a skirt for just £1.50

'It
 feels like it will be really good if the children fall over in the 
playground - it won't just rip as easily as other materials do.

'Most mums I know buy school uniforms from supermarkets now and I would usually go to Tesco or Sainsburys.

'But the offer from Aldi will keep mums going back to Aldi, and I would definitely buy another uniform from there in future.'

Tony
 Baines, managing director for corporate buying at Aldi, said: 'The run 
up to the new term can be a stressful time for families.

A unisex short sleeved shirt (left) will be priced at £1.99 each and a girls knitted cardigan (right) just £2.79

Aldi has unveiled its new back to school range with parents able to pick up an entire uniform for £4

'As a result, we were keen to offer 
parents the opportunity to stock up on superior school uniforms and 
accessories ahead of the new term without breaking the bank.

'We
 are therefore delighted to provide our customers with a fantastic 
quality school uniform range at the lowest price available in any 
supermarket.'

The Back to School range will be available in Aldi stores nationwide from July 24.

According to its website, Tesco offer a unisex sweater (left) for £3 and a pack of two polo shirts for £2 (left)

Sainsbury's, which offers most of their uniform items in multi-packs, sells two sweaters for £8

Sainsbury's also sells a pack of three white unisex polo shirts for £7

George at Asda sells skirts and trousers for £3.50 each - £2 more than the Aldi equivalent
