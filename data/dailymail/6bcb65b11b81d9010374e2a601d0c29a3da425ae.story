New details of unethical U.S. medical experiments in Guatemala in the 1940s have revealed that a dying woman was reinfected with syphilis.

The experiments nearly 70 years ago are already considered one of the darkest periods in U.S. medical research history.

Researchers who experimented on disabled American citizens and prison inmates in the name of medical advancement also infected a dying woman with syphilis in order to test whether penicillin could prevent infections.

New details released by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues revealed that soldiers, prostitutes, prisoners and mental patients were also among the 1,300 deliberately infected with the STD.

The commission revealed on Monday that only about 700 of those infected received some sort of treatment.

Of those infected, 83 people died, although it's not clear if the deaths were directly due to the experiments.

Some experts have claimed that the research came up with no useful medical information.

Anita Allen, a member of the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, said: 'The researchers put their own medical advancement first and human decency a far second.'

The experiments were hidden for decades but came to light last year after a Wellesley College medical historian discovered records among the papers of Dr. John Cutler, who led the experiments.

After the experiments were revealed, President Barack Obama called Guatemala's president, Alvaro Colom, to apologise before ordering the bioethics commission to investigate.

Though the final report is not due until next month, commission members discussed some of the findings at a meeting Monday in Washington.

They revealed that some of the experiments were more shocking than was previously known.

For example, seven women with epilepsy, who were housed at Guatemala's Asilo de Alienados (Home for the Insane), were injected with syphilis below the back of the skull, a risky procedure.

The researchers thought the new infection might somehow help cure epilepsy.

The women each got bacterial meningitis, probably as a result of the unsterile injections, but were treated.

Perhaps the most disturbing details involved a female syphilis patient with an undisclosed terminal illness. The researchers, curious to see the impact of an additional infection, infected her with gonorrhea in her eyes and elsewhere. Six months later she died.

Dr. Amy Gutmann, head of the commission, described the case as 'chillingly egregious.'

During that time, other researchers were also using people as human guinea pigs, in some cases infecting them with illnesses.

Panel members concluded that the Guatemala research was bad even by the standards of the time. They compared the work to a 1943 experiment by Cutler and others in which prison inmates were infected with gonorrhea in Indiana.

The inmates were volunteers who were told what was involved in the study and gave their consent. The Guatemalan participants - or many of them - received no such explanations and did not give informed consent, the commission said.

The commission is working on a second report examining federally funded international studies to make sure current research is being done ethically. That report is expected at the end of the year.

Meanwhile, the Guatemalan government has vowed to do its own investigation into the Cutler study. A spokesman for Vice President Rafael Espada said the report should be done by November.
