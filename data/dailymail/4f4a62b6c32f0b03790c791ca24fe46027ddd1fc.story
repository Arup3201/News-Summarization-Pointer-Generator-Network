The Gospel of St Luke was actually written by Jesus' mother, Mary, making it the first female book in the Bible, a writer has claimed.

Dr Adam Bradford believes the document people have come to know as the Third Gospel began life as a legal defence document in a trial.

Luke, a Greek physician, was tasked with writing a letter of support for St Paul who was imprisoned in Rome for the political crime of supporting Jesus.

The Gospel According to Luke (pictured in a folio from one of the oldest extant New Testament manuscripts in Greek) was actually written by Jesus's mother Mary- making it the first female book in the Bible, a London historian has claimed

Dr Bradford, who also works as a GP and lives in Blackheath, London, claims Luke needed to find out who Jesus of Nazareth was and turned to the one person who would know, Jesus's elderly mother Mary.

His claims emerge in the most sacred week of the Christian calendar, Holy Week, when believers reflect on the days leading up to Jesus' crucifixion.

The amateur historian said: 'Key information about Jesus' birth and childhood in the Gospel of Luke could only have come from Mary".

'As she was the only surviving eye-witness of those events when Luke was writing.

'Records at that time were almost 
exclusively male, yet Luke's manuscript is overwhelmingly female, and 
his early information was witnessed by one person and one person only, 
Mary, the mother of Jesus.

The Gospel of Luke is the third and longest of the four Gospels.

The gospel provides an account of the life  of Jesus, from his birth to his ascension.

The preface states that the reason behind the gospel is to provide an historical account, while bringing out the theological significance of the history.

Dr Adam Bradford believes the document 
people have come to know as the Third Gospel began life as a legal 
defence document in a trial.

Luke, a Greek physician, was tasked with 
writing a letter of support for St Paul who was imprisoned in Rome for 
the political crime of supporting Jesus, he said.

'All of the other players were long since dead.

'Only Mary had the knowledge and only Luke's Gospel provides them.

'Luke, a Roman physician, must have gone to the mother of Jesus.'

Dr Bradford drew his conclusions after studying and comparing the original Greek and Hebrew scriptures.

In his book, 'Luke's Gospel - as told by Mary', he claims that the number of feminine words contained in the scripture give away the true author.

The doctor, who runs an NHS practice in inner-city London, added that the writing also suggests Mary was far from being an uneducated peasant girl and was instead well-educated.

'Of the Gospel biographies of Jesus, Luke's stands head and shoulders above the others in terms of feminine references,' he said.

'While the Gospel of Mark has a feminine word content totaling 116, Luke has more than double that at 247.

'Luke was being informed by a woman, and given the number of "widow" references - nine as compared to John's Gospel's none - most likely a woman who had been widowed.'

'Luke's opening content points to one widow in particular, Mary, the wife of Joseph and mother of Jesus.

'Far from being an uneducated peasant girl, Dr Bradford's analysis of Mary's song "The Magnificat" in the original Greek manuscript reveals separate quotations from each section of the Bible of her day, numbering ten in total, showing that she had, unusually for the time, been well-educated.'

His newest book follows on from his revolutionary claims that Jesus was the son of a middle-class, highly educated architect, disputing the previous theory he worked as a carpenter.

Dr Brandord added: 'The first-century was a male-dominated world. My aim is to give Mary the credit she deserves. Without her Luke would have had much less of a story to tell.'

It's a somewhat different version of the greatest story ever told.

Rather than being born in a stable to a carpenter father, Jesus was actually the son of a successful, middle-class and highly intellectual architect.

The claim comes from biblical scholar Dr Adam Bradford, who also says that between the ages of 12 and 30  -  the so-called 'missing years' of Jesus's life, when little is known about him  -  he was studying at religious schools and became the highest-ranking rabbi in Judea.

The radical revision of Christian history would suggest that, in preaching the spurning of worldly possessions for an austere life, Jesus may have been speaking from experience.

Dr Bradford has analysed the Bible's original Greek and Hebrew scriptures to try to establish the truth about Christ's background.

He says a mistranslation of the Greek word 'tekton' to describe the profession of Joseph, Jesus's father, is one of many mistakes that have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Christ's character.

Dr Bradford claims that while 'tekton' is usually said to mean carpenter, it more accurately means master builder or architect. As an architect, Joseph would have had a higher social status that enabled him to better educate his son.
