A 23-year-old has stunned medics after his deficient heart appeared to mend itself when doctors decided they would need to perform a transplant.

And the parents of Michael Crowe are attributing his recovery to the power of prayer  - after the student's heart miraculously started working again, according to the Omaha World Herald.

The organ started beating again hours after doctors discovered Crowe had a blood infection which threatened any transplant operation.

Michael's heart had been on the verge of stopping beating when he arrived at the Heart Transplant unit at the Nebraska Medical Centre last month - and doctors hooked him up to a machine to keep blood pumping through his arteries.

He was suffering from an inflammation of the heart muscle caused by acute myocarditis, which left the vital organ barely functioning.

'When the heart stops, that’s defined as clinical death,” Dr. John Um of the hospital told ABC News. 'In this case, his body only stayed alive because the machine was pumping his blood for him.'

He was placed on a transplant list 
and put in a medically induced coma as his mother Marie and father John
 faced an agonising wait for a match.

A heart was found three weeks later, and doctors prepared to perform the risky transplant.

Even worse, Michael had contracted a blood infection that meant he would probably not survive the heart transplant operation. 

His family was faced with the heart breaking news that doctors would have to postpone the transplant.

But
 that it when his health took a miraculous turn - just an hour after 
doctors decided the transplant would be too risky, Michael's blood 
pressure started increasing even thought the machinery he was hooked up to was only there to maintain it at a solid level.

Soon after doctors conducted tests on Mr Crowe, and noted that his heart's left chamber had begun to heal itself.

'His heart started working again on its own.The left side of his heart was pumping blood again,' Dr. Um told ABC.

But shortly after the transplant was postponed, experts noticed that Mr Crowe's blood pressure was increasing,

A few days later, the organ even began working on its own.

Mr Crowe has since been sent home from the Nebraska Medical Center following his miraculous recovery.

Margie Crowe told the Omaha World Herald: 'It just truly is a medical miracle.

'Excellent medical care, and I think, the power of prayer.'
