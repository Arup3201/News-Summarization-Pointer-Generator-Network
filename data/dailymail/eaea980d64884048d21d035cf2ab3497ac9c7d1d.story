US internet firms have been warned by the British government they are not above the law after a damning report into the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.

Ministers have ordered web firms they must take a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to terrorist activity on their networks.

It comes after the Intelligence and Security Committee found MI5 'would have been able to prevent' the brutal murder of Fusilier Rigby if Facebook had alerted authorities to online murder threats made by one of the killers.

It was found that Michael Adebowale 'expressed his intent to murder a soldier in the most graphic and emotive manner' five months before last year's attack - but the warning was not passed on to UK authorities.

Fusilier Rigby, 25, was run over and then butchered by Adebowale and Adebolajo outside Woolwich barracks in south-east London in the first terror attack on British soil since the July 7 suicide bombings in 2005.

In the most explosive section of the ISC report, published in November, it stated: 'Had MI5 had access to this exchange at the time, Adebowale would have become a top priority. There is then a significant possibility that MI5 would have been able to prevent the attack.'

The report raised wider concerns that intelligence agencies faced ‘considerable difficulty’ in accessing the content of online communications from US-based firms including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo.

In the official government response, released today, ministers make clear that internet firms which operate in the UK must abide by UK law.

US social media giant Facebook allegedly failed to close down Michael Adebowale's personal account - even after he used it to post explicit threats to kill a soldier.

Today's report said: 'They left the one that said…“Let’s kill a soldier”. That didn’t meet their criteria [for closure].'

While MPs and peers refused to name the company in question, it was later reported to be Facebook. 

The report criticised internet companies for their refusal to cooperate with security services to help stop terror attacks.

It said it was 'clear' that social media companies could have 'made a difference' if they alerted British authorities to online messages in which Adebowale threatened to kill a soldier.

The report says the company which hosted the terror exchange 'does not regard themselves as under any obligation to ensure that they identify such threats, or to report them to the authorities'.

It added: 'We find this unacceptable: however unintentionally, they are providing a safe haven for terrorists.

None of the major US companies the committee approached proactively monitor and review suspicious content on their systems, largely relying on users to notify them of offensive or suspicious content.

None of them regard themselves as compelled to comply with UK warrants obtained under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.

That means that even if MI5 had a warrant for the information before the attack, the company might not have responded.

Ministers said: ‘The fact that a suspect is using a foreign, internet-based communications service as opposed to a UK-based equivalent should make no difference to our ability to access that suspect’s communications, if that company supplies a service to the UK.’

It warned of ‘obstacles’ which make it difficult for police and spies to obtain the data they need to ‘investigate and prevent terrorist acts’.

Social media sites and other so-called Communications Services Providers have now been told to take ‘stronger, faster and further action to combat the use of their services by terrorists, criminals and their supporters, including through a zero tolerance approach to terrorist activity on their networks’.

The government added: ‘They are committed to measures that make it easier for their users and the authorities to report terrorist and extremist propaganda.

‘We will build on this to encourage companies to work together to produce industry standards for the identification, removal and referral of terrorist activity.’

In November's report, the ISC criticised the security services for 'delays' in their investigations which at times was 'inadequate.'

It conceded that given what the agencies knew at the time 'they were not in a position to prevent the murder of Fusilier Rigby'.

However it slammed giant internet firms for failing to hand over key pieces of information which might have helped security chiefs stop the attacks.

It says Adebowale's detailed threat to kill a soldier, posted online in December 2012, was 'highly significant'.

In the most explosive section of the report, it states: 'Had MI5 had access to this exchange at the time, Adebowale would have become a top priority. There is then a significant possibility that MI5 would have been able to prevent the attack.'

The main findings of the report included:

When the report was released Facebook released a statement insisting it did not allow extremists to plan attacks on its site.

A spokesman said: ‘Like everyone else, we were horrified by the vicious murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.

‘We don’t comment on individual cases but Facebook’s policies are clear, we do not allow terrorist content on the site and take steps to prevent people from using our service for these purposes.’

Adebolajo and Adebowale ran down Fusilier Rigby, who was dressed in a Help for Heroes hoodie, in a Vauxhall Tigra near Woolwich Barracks, in south-east London, before savagely attacking the defenceless soldier as he lay in the road.

As armed police arrived, the two men charged the vehicle, with Adebowale brandishing a rusted, unloaded revolver. They were both shot at the scene.

The killers were convicted of murder at the Old Bailey in December last year and were later sentenced to whole life and life with a minimum of 45 years respectively.

The ISC report confirms both men were known to MI5 – especially Adebolajo, 29, who was arrested in Kenya in 2010 attempting to cross the border into Somalia to fight for the African terror group Al Shabaab. He was passed to British spies.

Michael Adebowale was encouraged to murder a British soldier by an online accomplice referred to only as ‘Foxtrot’ in today’s report.

Foxtrot was not known to MI5 at the time of the killing, but it now thought to be an extremist with links to Al Qaeda.

In December 2012 Adebowale revealed to Foxtrot his desire to murder a soldier ‘in the most graphic and emotive manner’ because of UK military action in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Adebowale had not, at that point, five months before the attack, developed a definite plan as to how he might carry out such an attack.

Foxtrot ‘encouraged him and suggested several potential attack methodologies’, the report reveals.

These ranged from ‘a martyrdom operation to use of a knife’.

‘Adebowale believed that security arrangements that guarded soldiers’ places of work might make it difficult to carry out an attack, and that alternative, less secure locations should be considered.

‘Foxtrot wanted to be kept informed of Adebowale’s ideas. However, no evidence of further contact between them has been found.’

The exchange only came to light on June 6, 2013, when a US internet company handed over the information. It cannot be published on national security grounds.

 

@highlight

Fusilier Rigby was murdered by  Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale

@highlight

Both men were known to MI5 but spies ruled they were not a major threat

@highlight

Adebowale posted threat to kill a soldier on internet five months earlier

@highlight

But Facebook allegedly failed to raise alarm over extremist posts 

@highlight

Intelligence committee said information may have prevented attack 

@highlight

MI5 delayed submitting an application to monitor Adebowale before he struck in May last year;

@highlight

Without the delay  MI5 would 'probably' have set up surveillance on Adebowale in 'the days before the attack’;

@highlight

The application was sitting on the Home Secretary Theresa May’s desk at the time of the killing - having only been handed in the day before;

@highlight

MI5 were trailing Adebowale's accomplice Adebolajo from December 2012 to April 2013;

@highlight

However, undercover agents did not discover anything of ‘national security concern’;

@highlight

This meant that MI5 had to cancel their surveillance of Adebolago in April 2013 – just weeks before the attack.
