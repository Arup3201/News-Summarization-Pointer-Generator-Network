A lake is being drained in the latest effort to find cousins Elizabeth Collins and Lyric Cook-Morrissey - who have been missing since Friday - after a search dog picked up their scent in the area.

Elizabeth, 8, and Lyric, 10, were last seen riding their bicycles in downtown Evansdale on Friday.

Hundreds of volunteers spent the weekend looking for the girls, whose bikes were found next to Meyers Lake on Friday afternoon, but so far both police and volunteers have no significant leads.

Desperate search: Authorities look for possible evidence at Meyers Lake where Lyric Cook-Morrissey, 10, and Elizabeth Collins, 8, disappeared last Friday

More than 350
volunteers joined the search over the weekend. Teams have been dragging the lake for the past two days but have found nothing. 

A spokesman from Black Hawk County Sheriff's Office said it would take another two days at least for the lake to be fully drained.

FBI spokeswoman Sandy Breault said 
the reaction from the dogs on Monday night indicated a 'strong 
possibility' the girls had been at the lake, less than a mile from their
grandmother's house where they were last seen on Friday.

However, Breault said because there were no confirmed sightings at the lake, authorities could not be certain.

Chief Deputy Rick Abben of the Black 
Hawk County Sheriff's Office said the case was still considered a 
missing persons investigation.

The decision to drain the lake was made to rule out the possibility the girls were in the water, he said.

Breault said the search has been slowed because of the time required to drain the lake.

The draining began Monday afternoon and could take up to three days.

But local officials said the draining
likely will go faster because of the already low level of the lake and 
the Cedar River into which it drains.

The lake is draining through a 3-foot
culvert with a grate over it that would prevent a body from flowing 
into it, Abben said. A pump was brought in on Tuesday to quicken the 
pace.

Officers slowly paddled around the lake in kayaks on Tuesday morning.

A group of three officers walking along the southeast shoreline stopped to study something that appeared to be a cup.

An officer with gloves and an evidence bag picked it up and took it back to a patrol car sitting along the bank.

Officials didn't 
identify the object or even confirm whether it was related to the search
for the girls but it was a 
rare sign of activity in a massive search that has produced few if any 
significant leads.

Dan Morrissey, Lyric's father, told the Associated Press: 'I don't think that they're
in the lake, not at all but it is just like a dead end as far as we know
so far.'

He added: 'We've never gone through 
anything like this. It's hard enough just to get up and deal with the 
reality that your daughter is gone.'

Family members were still hopeful 
that the girls would be found safe, despite investigators admitting that
had no new clues as to their whereabouts.

Chief Deputy Abben said authorities were interviewing family and friends of the girls in hopes that they might shed some light on the girls' behaviour and state of mind before their disappearance.

Tammy Brousseau, 48, an aunt to both of the girls, said all the signs were pointing to a stranger - possibility a pedophile - who may have abducted them from the area where the bikes were found.

Brousseau said that just last week she taught Lyric how to 'save someone if they went limp in the water.'

She said she also taught both girls how to 'drop to the ground and fight' if someone tried to abduct them.

Mom and dad: Lyric's parents Misty and Dan Morrissey say they don't suspect a drowning, noting the girls' swimming abilities and the fact that no shoes were recovered on the bank of the lake

Lyric's parents said they didn't suspect a drowning either, noting the girls' swimming abilities and the fact that no shoes were recovered on the bank of the lake.

Dan Morrissey said: 'The area where the bikes were found is fenced on both sides, and it is right where [a] maintenance gate is. It is a spot that looks to me like a trap.

'Somebody could have just come along right then or followed them down it would have been the worst spot to be in right there.'

Search: More than 350 volunteers came Saturday to help search Deerwood Park for the two missing girls

Local support: Volunteer Earl Conerd searches debris around Meyers Lake. But, despite a large turn-out of volunteers, police say they have not found any evidence that would point them to the girls' whereabouts

Registered sex offenders in the are are also being interviewed.   

The mothers of both girls said they were trying to stay strong as the search dragged on.

Misty Cook-Morrissey said: 
'Sometimes, when you think about it, you wonder if they're dead 
somewhere, but you try to push those thoughts out of your mind.'

The girls were being looked after by 
their grandmother Wilma Cook on Friday when they decided to take a cycle
ride to the nearby lake.

Mrs Morrissey alerted authorities when the 
girls had not returned home by 3pm.

Despite the mystery surrounding their disappearance, police do not believe the girls are victims of a crime. Mr Abben said: 'At this time it's still a missing persons case. There's no indication of foul play.'
