Britain's tax system is a ‘complicated’ 
mess which successive Governments have made even worse, the Institute 
for Fiscal Studies said last night.

Paul
 Johnson, director of the economic forecaster, launched a withering 
attack on a tax system which he said is riddled by complexity and shows 
‘few signs of a wider coherent strategy.’

He
 criticised council tax for becoming ‘increasingly absurd’, claimed 
stamp duty was ‘a strong contender for the UK’s worst-designed tax’ and 
condemned the increase in the number of higher rate taxpayers to around 
five million people.

The number of higher rate taxpayers and those paying tax at 45 per cent has soared from 3.3million when the coalition Government came to power to an expected 5.3million next April, while rules on the chocolate eyes of gingerbread men remain complex

Every government is guilty of tweaking, tinkering and tearing up tax rules, which are then overhauled by their successors.

What is left is a complex web of rules, and hundreds of bizarre unintended consequences. They include:

Mr 
Johnson also ridiculed ministers for boasting about helping 
‘hard-working families’ by increasing the tax-free personal allowance - 
but failing to change National Insurance.

In
 a speech in London last night at an event organised by the Chartered 
Institute of Taxation he said Britain’s tax system is far more complex 
than it needs to be.

He cited 
the example of VAT being charged at 20 per cent on gingerbread men 
decorated with chocolate - but not charged if only two bits of chocolate
 are used for the gingerbread man’s eyes.

Mr
 Johnson said stamp duty is ‘one of the worst designed and most damaging
 of all taxes’, and is one which ‘helps to gum up the entire property 
market.’

He said the tax, paid by the majority of homebuyers when purchasing a property, will be worth around £15billion a year by 2018.

That compares to just £800million in 1997.

It
 used to be charged at one per cent on homes sold for more than £60,000,
 but is now charged at five different thresholds of up to seven per cent
 on homes bought for more than £2million.

The
 IFS singled out the absurdity of the threshold system, which means a £1
 increase in the sale price of a property can increase the tax bill by 
£40,000.

Mr Johnson added: ‘The case for maintaining stamp duty is very weak indeed.’

Moving
 on to council tax he said it is ‘patently inequitable’ because the tax 
is based on the valuation of people’s homes which was done in April 
1991.

Mr Johnson warned: ‘It 
seems more than likely that we will enter the 2020s and beyond with our 
main property tax...based on property values from the latter part of the
 last century.’

The IFS 
director accused politicians of being too scared of revaluating people’s
 homes because ‘the political cost of creating losers is judged too 
great.’

The number of higher 
rate taxpayers and those paying tax at 45 per cent has soared from 
3.3million when the coalition Government came to power to an expected 
5.3million next April.

That’s
 because the starting salary at which higher rate tax is paid has fallen
 from £43,875 to £41,865 today and only £42,285 next April.

Mr
 Johnson said this ‘reflected a deliberate policy choice by a government
 aiming to keep down the (huge) cost of raising the personal allowance.’

Mr Johnson also ridiculed ministers for boasting about helping 'hard-working families' by increasing the tax-free personal allowance - but failing to change National Insurance

And he said the increase in 
the number of higher rate taxpayers represents a ‘fundamental change to 
our tax system’, but one which has ‘never been announced or properly 
debated.

Meanwhile an 
increase in the amount you can earn before paying tax has seen more 
people paying national insurance when they are not paying income tax.

Since
 2010 the personal allowance has increased from £6,475 a year to £10,000
 a year but the starting point at which National Insurance is charged 
has barely changed.

Mr Johnson said: ‘It is hard to think of a rationale, and none has been offered.’

More than one million low-paid workers are now paying National Insurance, but not income tax, he said.

Paul Johnson, director of the economic forecaster, launched a withering attack on a tax system which he said is riddled by complexity and shows 'few signs of a wider coherent strategy'

He
 said it is now ‘a commonplace accepted by virtually all tax experts 
outside of HM Revenue and Customs and HM Treasury that National 
Insurance is no more than an additional tax on earnings’, adding: ‘They 
are a tax.’

Mr Johnson said: 
‘The pious statements of politicians that they are raising the personal 
allowance in order to help ‘hard-working families’ look less credible in
 the face of the clear fact that raising the National Insurance primary 
threshold would be more effective in doing so.’

Meanwhile,
 he also singled out the failure of the Government to apply annual 
inflation-linked increases to some key tax changes, such as the 
scrapping of child benefit.

Since
 January 2013, no family is allowed to receive child benefit if one or 
both parents earn more than £60,000. They start to lose child benefit 
once one of their salary’s goes over £50,000.

Equally, the tax-free personal allowance begins to be withdrawn once a person’s salary hits £100,000.

He
 said: ‘Chancellors looking to fill their coffers as a result of fiscal 
drag will no doubt enjoy the effects of the lack of indexation of these 
new thresholds, but this looks like a move away from rational design.’

Mr
 Johnson also said the married couples’ tax allowance has been poorly 
designed because it creates such a ‘cliff edge’ - that is, the problem 
of becoming a higher rate taxpayer.

A
 couple will lose the benefit, worth around £210 a year off their tax 
bill, if one of them becomes a higher rate taxpayer. For example, a £1 
pay rise could result in an additional £210 tax bill.

Last
 night, Patrick Stevens, tax policy director of the Chartered Institute 
of Taxation, said it is ‘very important that the UK has a coherent and 
workable tax system’, but warned: ‘Much work remains to be done.’ He 
said politicians have ‘a duty to respond’ to Mr Johnson’s criticisms, 
even though they are a ‘often driven by short-term pressures’.

A
 Treasury spokesman said: ‘As part of our long-term economic plan, we 
have steadily cut income tax so that hard-working families have more 
financial security for the future.

‘Our tax reforms have made the UK one of the most competitive countries in the world, attracting investment, jobs and business.

‘We have changed the approach to tax policy making so that it is more predictable, stable and simple.’
