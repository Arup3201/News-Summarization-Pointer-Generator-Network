Dressed in fatigues and flanked by younger Kurdish soldiers, Brian Wilson uses the Arabic acronym Daesh, a name ISIS reportedly hates, to refer to the extremist group he plans to fight in Syria.

The 43-year-old Desert Storm veteran from Ohio says in a video released by Reuters he is one of a few Americans that traveled to 'help the YPG.'

While Americans have been confirmed to be among the ranks of ISIS, and among their dead, Wilson is the second American reported to be fighting against the extremist group on the side of the Kurds.

Brothers in arms: Brian Wilson (center) is seen with four Kurdish fighters in Syria and said he is one of a handful of Americans who has gone to Syria to 'help the YPG'

The YPG, or People's Protection Units, is the militia fighting ISIS in the Kurdish-controlled territory in Syria.

Kurdish militants are currently engaged in intense street fighting with Islamic State militants over the town of Kobani along the border of Turkey.

American-led air strikes only slowed the incursion of ISIS extremists on the town, though The Guardian reports that YPG fighters have been able to hold on to most of the city.

Wilson himself has not yet seen combat, having traveled to Syria through his 'Kurdish contacts,' and gave the interview in Qamishli, a town about 180 miles east of Kobani.

Wilson's family is still unsure why he left behind his children to join up with the Kurdish militia, though a relative said: 'He's a real big history buff and he has talked about the situation there.' 

A spokesman for the militia said that Jordan Matson, a 28-year-old from Wisconsin, is also fighting with the YPG and has given an interview to a Kurdish TV station.

Foreign fighters: Jordan Matson, 28, also joined the Kurdish militia to fight off Islamic militants, saying that he was upset seeing 'Christians being slaughtered'

Departure: News reports say Matson left his girlfriend to join up with the YPG, though others mistook him for a bank employee in Wisconsin

YPG spokesperson Redur Xelil confirmed Matson was with the group and said 'He is fighting in the Jazaa area,' which is in northeast Syria and has been the setting of numerous clashes with ISIS. 

Matson described himself as a former Marine, though a U.S. Army spokesperson said he was a private first class in the army from May 2006 to November 2007.

The Midwesterner, who was seen dressed in fatigues and a shemagh, or headscarf, was reportedly wounded by a mortar shell, according to a tweet from Xelil on October 1.

While Wilson waits to join the YPG fighters in battle, he says that the Kurds have welcomed him in their territory.

Recruit: There are few clues why the 43-year-old Desert Storm veteran joined up with the Kurds in Syria, though he reportedly talked of the conflict before traveling to Syria

Enlisted: Wilson joined the YPG through Kurdish contacts he had and described his hosts as 'very nice, very accommodating, hospitable'

'Everything has been fine. They're very nice, very
accommodating, hospitable. Very good people,' he said in the video. 

At a meeting last week chaired by U.S. President Barack Obama, the U.N. Security Council said all countries should make it a serious criminal offense for their citizens to fight abroad with militant groups.

The United States has no specific law preventing individuals from joining groups like ISIS, but it has anti-terrorism laws that it has used to prosecute those associated with such groups.

The YPG has not been designated by the United States as a terrorist organization but it has close ties to the Kurdistan Workers Party in Turkey, which does have such a designation.

The PKK has spent three decades fighting for autonomy for Turkey's Kurds.
