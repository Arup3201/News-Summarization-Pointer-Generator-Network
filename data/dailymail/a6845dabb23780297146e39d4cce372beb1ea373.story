Michael William Lutts, 50, is accused of groping a baby boy's genitals while masturbating on camera

A paediatric nurse in San Diego, California has been charged with molesting his two-month-old foster child.

Michael William Lutts, 50, pleaded not guilty in federal court yesterday to a charge of sexually exploiting a child, said Darrell Foxworth, an FBI spokesman in San Diego.

Court documents graphically tell of how Lutts allegedly groped the boy's genitals while masturbating, videoing the whole event. 

And pictures show the boy still had his hospital tag attached to his leg as he was being abused.

The documents say that Lutts then taped himself again a week later, masturbating in his living room with the baby nearby. 

He began molesting the boy on the day he was given custody of him, and recorded images and video on a phone that was seized during a search at his College Grove home on Tuesday, an FBI agent stated in the criminal complaint.

Time stamps on the images indicate that the boy was molested for at least 10 days.

He can be heard crying during many of the videos, FBI agents said. 

Lutts is a paediatric nurse in San Diego County, and was given custody of the prematurely born boy on August 4.

'In my 28 years of being an FBI agent, it's one of the more disturbing cases,' Mr Foxworth said. 'You look at the age of the victim here. This is a helpless child.'

The FBI began investigating Lutts after he was linked to an email account that authorities believe was used to send indecent images of children to a suspected distributor.

FBI investigators found  hundreds more pictures and videos depicting sick images of children on computers, hard drives, CDs and other media, according to the criminal complaint.

Mr Foxworth said investigators plan to examine the material to identify other possible victims, and because Lutts' job gave him access to children, they are also were asking anyone with information to come forward.

Authorities  intend to look at the process by which Lutts was given care of the foster baby, who is now in protective custody.

Lutts' employers, medical group Kaiser Permanente, told NBC San Diego: 'At Kaiser Permanente, our first priority is to keep our patients safe as we address their health care needs, and nothing is more important than assuring the appropriate care of our young patients. 

'We hold sacred the trust our patients place in Kaiser Permanente. We will not tolerate any employee or physician abusing that trust.'
