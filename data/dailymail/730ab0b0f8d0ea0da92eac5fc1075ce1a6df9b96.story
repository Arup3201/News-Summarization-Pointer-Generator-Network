Paid parental leave should be replaced with a HECS-style loan that parents would repay when they returned to work, a new report says.

The Fairer Paid Parental Leave report from The Centre for Independent Studies argues the Abbott government's proposed scheme is poorly targeted, delivering large amounts of cash to the highest-income families.

Under government's policy, scheduled to start in mid-2015, a woman will receive her full wage for six months, including superannuation, capped at $50,000.

Paid parental leave should be replaced with a HECS-style loan, and parents would repay all but $5000 of the money they received, a new report argues

Report author Matthew Taylor says the government's proposed scheme is expensive and unfair.

Instead, Mr Taylor argues for the implementation of a Parental Leave Contribution Scheme which would pay up to 26 weeks of the primary carer's pre-birth wages.

But parents would need to repay all but $5000, and repayments would start once they earned above a minimum threshold.

Both parents would be responsible for repayments regardless of their relationship status, and the parent with higher earnings would make most of the repayments.

Under the government's current proposed policy, scheduled to start in mid-2015, a woman will receive her full wage for six months capped at $50,000

The report says the expenditure on this PPL loans scheme would cost approximately 12 percent of likely 2016–17 expenditure on the Abbott government's PPL policy – tipped to be more than $5 billion.

The government's leave scheme has been criticised for being too generous.

'Despite the Abbott government's claims that the scheme is a productivity measure, the additional $3 billion of expenditure will do nothing to increase women's labour force participation,' Mr Taylor said.'

'The coalition's PPL scheme is also unfair, giving $50,000 to women with incomes over $100,000, but only $16,172 to women earning the minimum wage.

'I think a fairer approach would be for everyone to fund their own leave through their own future incomes… Not shifting all the cost onto the taxpayer.'

The move took money from low-income families and gave it to those who could afford to self-finance their parental leave, he said.

The scheme was also excessively costly as many parents, especially those on high wages, already have access to paid parental leave from their employers.
