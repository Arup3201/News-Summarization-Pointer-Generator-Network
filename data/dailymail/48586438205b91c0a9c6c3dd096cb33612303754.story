Max Clifford's QC has told Southwark Crown Court his trial is 'haunted by the spectre of Jimmy Saville'

Max Clifford's trial has been 'haunted by the spectre of Jimmy Savile', jurors were told yesterday.

The Top of the Pops presenter's exposure as a paedophile after his 2011 death led to a succession of celebrities being arrested under the police's Operation Yewtree.

Clifford's QC, Richard Horwell, told Southwark Crown Court his client's trial must be seen in this context.

He said: 'What a time we live in. This trial has been haunted by the spectre of Jimmy Savile.

'The Jimmy Savile effect cannot be ignored. Why are wealthy celebrities the subject of these accusations?' Clifford himself has branded his accusers compensation-seekers and attention-hunters.

The 71-year-old PR agent - who claims he never met Savile - has also said Operation Yewtree was set up 'to try and cover up the embarrassment Savile caused the Met police'.

In his closing remarks to the jury yesterday, Mr Horwell rubbished suggestions the publicist was a 'sexual predator'.

He said Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst would be spinning in her grave at the prosecution portraying women of the Sixties and Seventies as 'as lacking in all resolve'.

Mr Howell accused Clifford's accusers of making up the allegations and telling their family and friends about them.

The QC said: 'It doesn't matter if a complainant has reported the complaint to the Archbishop of Canterbury - an unreliable complaint remains an unreliable complaint, no matter how many times it is repeated.'

He said the women would have felt 'substantial pressure' to tell police when Operation Yewtree was launched so they did not 'lose face' with the family and friends they had already told their stories to.

Mr Horwell accused prosecutors of being 'obsessed with Mr Clifford's sex life' and portraying the PR agent as an 'Olympic-standard sexual athlete'.

But he branded the prosecution case 'grubby voyeurism' that was a 'fifth-rate fiction of a standard not even Mills and Boon would countenance.'

In his closing remarks to the jury yesterday, Mr Horwell rubbished suggestions the publicist, pictured outside Southwark Crown Court with his daughter Louise, was a 'sexual predator'

He said: 'Yes, his sex life was not 
conventional, whatever that may be. His sex life and adulterous 
relationships are not on trial here. He liked sex. He had a number of 
sexual partners. He worked in an environment in which most people were 
having affairs.

'But 
he told you the sex he had was consensual.' The publicist had earlier 
confessed to having four long-term affairs with women while married to 
his first wife Elizabeth.

'It doesn't matter if a complainant has 
reported the complaint to the Archbishop of Canterbury - an unreliable 
complaint remains an unreliable complaint'

- Richard Horwell QC

The
 court heard that while his accusers have been shielded by their legal 
right to anonymity, Clifford's life had been plunged into turmoil since 
his arrest in December 2012.

Mr Horwell said their claims 'come not from a different time but quite literally from a different age - imagine having to deal with events going back up to 48 years, a time when many people in this court were not even born.

Stories made up for whatever reason eventually become fixed in the minds of those who have concocted them.'

But Rosina Cottage QC, prosecuting, urged the jury not to be fooled by the kiss and tell agent. She branded him a 'risk taker prepared for some danger' who indecently assaulted a string of teenagers over 20 years.

She asked them why so many women - who do not know each other - would make complaints of such 'similarity', and why they would have confided in friends many years ago, unless they were telling the truth.

The PR guru, pictured outside court yesterday,  denies 11 counts of indecent assault on seven teenage girls and women from 1966 to 1984

Miss Cottage said Clifford used the same 'pattern again and again' of bragging about the celebrities he knew and the Hollywood careers he could forge before attacking his young victims.

She said: 'He is a master in the art of intimidation and manipulation. No one would believe a silly girl. It was an elaborate art.'

She added: 'These girls don't know each other but we have this pattern.' Wearing a sky blue blazer, white shirt and dark blue trousers, Clifford shook his head furiously in the dock as Miss Cottage spoke.

He denies 11 counts of indecent assault on seven teenage girls and women from 1966 to 1984.

The case continues.
