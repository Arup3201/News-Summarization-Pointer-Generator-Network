Angry: Alana Willetts with her son George, nine, who has been banned from using Black Country dialect at school

Children at a primary school in the West Midlands have been told to speak proper English instead of the Black Country dialect to halt a ‘decline in standards’.

Those who say they ‘cor do that’ – ‘can’t do that’ – will not be punished, but they will be corrected every time they utter an outlawed phrase.

Angry parents criticised the ban at Colley Lane Primary School in Halesowen, claiming it is ‘snobbish’ and ‘insulting’.

A letter posted to parents last week said the school wanted pupils to have the ‘best start possible’.

It added: ‘Recently we asked each class teacher to write a list of the top ten most damaging phrases used by children in the classroom. We are introducing a “zero tolerance” in the classroom to get children out of the habit of using the phrases on the list.’

The Black Country includes Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall, and southern parts of Wolverhampton. Other words and phrases on the prohibited list include ‘ay’, meaning ‘pardon’, and ‘I day’, meaning ‘I didn’t’.

Alana Willetts, 30, whose nine-year-old son George goes to the school, said staff should be teaching pupils about the Black Country and its dialect.

‘Some of my friends have gone on to be doctors and lawyers and I’m an engineer – [the accent] doesn’t affect you as a person,’ she said. ‘I think it is patronising and insulting to say that people with a Black Country accent are disadvantaged. All the parents are outraged.’

Ann Mills, 62, who has two grandchildren at the school, added: ‘I was raised here and I’m proud of the way we speak.’

Colley Lane Primary School, in Halesowen, West Midlands, where staff have have drawn up a list of offending Black Country phrases that have been banned in the classroom

Here are the phrases pupils at Colley Lane Primary School, in Halesowen, have been banned from using:

1. 'They was' instead of 'they were.'

2. 'I cor do that' instead of 'I can't do that.'

3. 'Ya' instead of 'you.'

4. 'Gonna' instead of 'going to.'

5. 'Woz' instead of 'was.'

6. 'I day' instead of 'I didn't.'

7. 'I ain't' instead of 'I haven't.'

8. 'Somefink' instead of 'something.'

9. 'It wor me' instead of 'it wasn't me.'

10. 'Ay?' instead of 'pardon?'

But Zheyan Kareem, 31, who moved to 
the UK eight years ago and whose seven-year-old son is a pupil, 
supported the ban, saying:  ‘English is my second language. So for 
me … it is good if my child speaks English in the house and not slang 
picked up at school.’

The 
primary school, which has 592 children aged four to 11 and was judged 
‘good’ at its last Ofsted inspection, defended the move. Headteacher 
John White said: ‘We value the dialect but we want to encourage children
 to learn when to use it and when not, like for a job interview.’

The Black 
Country includes the three Metropolitan Boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell and
 Walsall and the southern parts of the city of Wolverhampton, but does 
not include Birmingham.

Headteacher John White said: 'I think we are seeing a decline in standards of English when children come into school.

'We are seeing that some children coming in are not able to speak very much at all to be honest.

'I
 think some of the changes in society - the amount of time people sit 
around and talk together and the amount of screen time - seem to be 
having an effect on how confidently children speak when starting school.

'We
 want to pick them up on that and improve their standards in English. It
 is important because it is the foundation of everything.

The letter staff at Colley Lane Primary School, in Halesowen, West Midlands, sent out to parents

'If they can't say it, it is likely they can't read it, and even less likely they can write it.

'We value the dialect but we want to encourage children to learn when to use and when not, like for a job interview. It is, of course, fine to use in other situations and we would celebrate that.

'We know it is a topic lots of people will be interested in, but I'm positive about it. If it starts to get people talking about the issue, that can only be a good thing.

'We will correct children if they get the words wrong.'

The school was rated as either Good or Outstanding in a Ofsted inspection report in 2010.

The distinctive Black Country dialect of the 'Yam Yams' is spoken in towns like Wolverhampton, Sandwell, Tipton and Dudley, and can be very confusing to outsiders.

Scholars find it fascinating because it has preserved grammar from Early Modern English and even Middle English.

'Thee', 'Thy' and 'Thou' are still in use, as is the case in parts of Yorkshire and Lancashire. 'Ow B'ist', meaning 'How beist thou?' is a common greeting, with the typical answer being 'Bay too bah', meaning 'I bayn't be too bad'.

'I haven't seen her' becomes 'I ay sid 'er'. Black Country dialect often substitutes the word 'ar' for 'yes'.

Several word pronunciations are also different: 'you' is pronounced 'yow' (pronounced yo  with a silent w), whereas 'go', which is often pronounced 'goo' or 'gooin'' for 'going', is more in line with pronunciations in the Midlands.

It is also quite common for broad Black Country speakers to say 'agooin' instead of 'going'.

Inhabitants are proud to be known as Black Country 'folk' and resist hints at any relationship to people living in Birmingham, calling Birmingham 'Brum-a-jum' (Birmingham's colloquial name is 'Brummagem', a corruption of its older name of 'Bromwicham' and hence West Bromwich) or 'Birminam' (missing the g and h out and saying it the way it's spelt).

Residents of Birmingham ('Brummies') meanwhile often refer to their Black Country neighbours as 'Yam Yams', a reference to the use of 'Yow am' (or yow'm ) instead of 'You are', and not because they say 'I yam' instead of 'I am'.

Dudley residents often refer to the people of Birmingham as 'Dummy Brummies'. Also, the town of Walsall can be pronounced either 'War-sall' or 'Wor-sull', with a strong Walsall accent considered to be typical 'yam-yam'.

The strong Black Country dialect is less commonly heard today than in the past. However, a stronger variation of the dialect (than the one frequently used) appears to be heard quite often in conversations between older Black Country folk.

The word endings with 'en' are still noticeable in conversation as in 'gooen' (going), 'callen' (calling) and the vowel 'A' is pronounced as 'O' as in 'sond' (sand), 'hond' (hand) and 'mon' (man). Other pronunciations are 'winder' for window, 'fer' for 'far', and 'loff' for 'laugh' exactly as Chaucer's English was spoken.

Local dialect was (and probably still is to a lesser degree) quite distinctive between the different towns and villages of the Black Country. Although most outsiders to the Black Country can't tell this difference, Black Country folk can quiet fiercely defend the difference between the accent.
