She used to spend her days posing in her underwear but now glamour model Carley Watts, 24, is to cover up after falling in love with Tunisian lifeguard, Mohammed Salah, 25.

The model, from Dearham in Norfolk, met Salah during a holiday in Tunisia in April and says she is so serious about the lifeguard she is set to Islam to become his wife.

From October, Carley and her daughter Alannah, two, will live close to his family in the city of Monastir, where she will spend six months learning about the faith - and planning their wedding.

Convert: Carley Watts will convert to Islam ahead of her marriage to Tunisian lifeguard Mohammed Salah

Husband to be: Carley met her fiance Mohammed during a holiday in the Tunisian city of Monastir

Carley told the Sun on Sunday that her friends think she is mad and that this is just a phase: 'They can’t get their heads round me going from being 
the last girl standing on every night out to wearing a veil and 
converting to Islam. Meeting
 Mohammed has made me really look at my life. I don’t want to be going 
wild, flashing my boobs and falling out of nightclubs any more. But we 
couldn’t be more different.

'As
 a glamour model I show off my boobs, dress up in kinky outfits and 
generally act outrageous. Mohammed is solely focused on family life. If I’m drunk I like to take my clothes off and recently I walked all the way home from a nightclub totally starkers. I
 love going to raves and staying up dancing all night in little tutus 
and bra tops. Now my life is set to change beyond belief. I don’t have 
any worries, though.'

The day job: Mohammed's parents won't be told about Carley's glamour modelling career

Although Mohammed does know what Carley does for a living, she told the Sun that his family aren't aware of her career and won't be told.

She explained that the fact she is a single mother was already enough of a shock for them.

She said: 'He explained that he
 loved me and wanted me to be his wife and they have come round to that. He accepts that [glamour modelling] is what I do and doesn’t try to change me. But he says once we are married my body is for his eyes only.'

Single mothers are almost unheard of in Tunisia, where sex outside of marriage is frowned upon and is punishable by law.

'Single mums don’t exist in his world 
and men who get unmarried women pregnant go to prison. It is all about 
family and he idolises his mother,' she added.

'These
 are the kind of values I love about their culture. Women are treated 
with respect and they also respect themselves and their bodies. They 
don’t do one-night stands or casual flings. When I’m with Mohammed I feel so content, calm and happy. I know he’s the kind, family man for me.'
