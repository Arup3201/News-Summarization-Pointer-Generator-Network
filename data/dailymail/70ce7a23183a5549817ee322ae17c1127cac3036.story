Cooperating: Lance Armstrong may testify in hopes of ending his lifetime ban from cycling

Lance Armstrong may spill all the details of his cheating career to anti-doping officials in a possible bid to compete on his bike again.

The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) says that Armstrong has asked for an extension on a deadline to testify about his cheating in the sport as he won seven Tour de France titles.

The deadline was imposed by USADA in an effort to have Armstrong confess about how he was able to keep doping and his use of performance-enhancing drugs a secret for so long.

In a statement on the agency's website, the agency CEO Travis Tygart said: 'We have been in communication with Mr. Armstrong and his representatives and we understand that he does want to be part of the solution and assist in the effort to clean up the sport of cycling.

'We have agreed to his request for an additional two weeks to work on details to hopefully allow for this to happen.'

The move to testify is a complete turnaround for the cyclist, who has previously said he would only talk to World Anti-Doping Agency officials in favor of USADA.

In a testy exchange of letters and 
statements revealing the rift between the two sides, USADA urged 
Armstrong to testify under oath.

Armstrong's attorneys responded that 
the cyclist would rather take his information where it could do more 
good - namely to cycling's governing body and World Anti-Doping Agency 
officials.

USADA's response to that: 'The time for excuses is over.'

A little help: Armstrong celebrates after winning the 15th stage of the Tour de France in 2003 - one of the years that he admitted to cheating

Confession: Armstrong admitted to Oprah Winfrey that his seven Tour de France titles were won with the help of performance-enhancing drugs, but he denied that he used them for his 2009 comeback

The letters underscore the continuing
feud between Armstrong and Tygart, the man who 
spearheaded the investigation that uncovered a complex doping scheme on 
Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service teams.

Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories last year and he has been banned for life from the sport.

Off the hook? SCA Promotions says it will sue Armstrong over the $12million in bonuses he refused to return

In the Oprah interview, Armstrong said he owed a long list of 
apologies and that he would like to see his lifetime ban reduced so he 
can compete again.

Neither Armstrong nor his attorney responded to emails from ABC News seeking comment.

At
the same time, Armstrong is the target of a federal investigation for 
lying to investigators and bullying anyone who knew the truth about his 
doping to stay silent.

The ex-Tour de France champion is 
potentially facing charges of obstruction, witness tampering and 
intimidation relating to the systematic cover-up of his drug-taking when
he was competing.

It's the latest in an ongoing conflict for Armstrong, who admitted to cheating at the sport during a blockbuster interview last month with Queen of Talk Oprah Winfrey.

Yesterday, it was revealed that the company that awarded Lance Armstrong $12million in bonuses for three of his seven Tour de France victories will now fight him in court to get it back.

Armstrong had said earlier this week that he would not be paying back the the millions he collected in bonuses from Texas-based SCA Promotions during three of his seven Tour de France victories.

Those victories came in 2002, 2003 and 2004 - all races in which Armstrong admitted that he cheated to win.

Shamed: Armstrong told Oprah that he never tried to stop or change the culture of drug use in the sport

Despite the Oprah confession, the Armstrong camp insisted that the bonus funds are his, and they're non-refundable.

Armstrong's lawyer Tim Herman told USA Today that his client has no intention of repaying Texas-based SCA Promotions, which paid and insured the $12million.

Opponent: Armstrong had a continuing feud with USADA CEO Travis Tygart, who spearheaded a probe into doping on Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service teams

Mr
Herman told USA Today: 'My only point is no athlete ever, to my 
understanding, has ever gone back and paid back his compensation. Not 
[New Orleans Saints coach] Sean Payton or anybody else.

Payton was banned from the NFL for 
the entire 2012-2013 football season for his role in pushing a 
'crush-for-cash' bounty program on the team.

Herman added: 'They were suspended, but nobody said you've got to give your paycheck back.'

Separately, Armstrong faces a civil whistleblower lawsuit filed by former teammate Floyd Landis, accusing Armstrong of fraud.

Meanwhile, it has been revealed that Armstrong is the subject of an active criminal investigation by federal investigators.

The revelation runs contrary to statements made today by the U.S. Attorney for Southern California, Andre Birotte, who spent nearly two years on a criminal investigation of Armstrong, 41, only to suddenly drop it this time last year.

In February 2012, Birotte said his office had closed its investigation into possible crimes by Armstrong.

Birotte's comments come amid a firestorm of backlash against the disgraced cyclist with his actions since his doping admission.

On Tuesday, Armstrong tied with former Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o in atop a Forbes poll ranking America's most disliked athletes.
