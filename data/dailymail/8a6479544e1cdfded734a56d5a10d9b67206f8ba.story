Google has moved a step closer to mass-producing Google Glass after taking a stake in a company that makes the device's screens.

It has taken a 6.3 per cent stake in Himax Display (HDI) - a subsidiary of Taiwanese company Himax Technologies that makes the liquid crystal on silicon glass chips used in Google Glass products.

Analysts claim this is a clear sign Google is preparing to increase production of its coveted headmounted devices.

The company is said to be preparing to increase production of the headmounted devices by the end of the year

Liquid crystal on silicon ( LCOS) is a technology used in projection televisions and other devices that beam images to a screen.

The images are reflected by the liquid crystals, which act in a similar way to mirrors.

The crystals are applied directly to the surface of a silicon chip coated  which is highly reflective layer.

A benefit of LCOS technologies is that the crystals can produce high-resolution and contrast images compared to those used in plasma screens.

Google uses these chips in the screen on the right lens of its headmounted Google Glass products.

Figures quoted by the Wall Street 
Journal suggest the company could be looking to ship up to two million 
units a year, while Mark Gomes of PoisedtoTriple Research suggested that
the Taiwan-based manufacturer wants to boost production to seven million a 
year.

Google is said to have agreed to invest in the company to 'fund production, expand capacity and enhance production capabilities' for the chips, according to a press release from Himax Technologies.

Under the agreement, Google will hold a 6.3 per cent interest in HDI with the option to make additional investment of preferred shares at the same price within one year from closing.

Himax Technologies holds 81.5 per cent of HDI and will remain the major shareholder after the transaction.

Google join other shareholders including KPCB Holdings, Khosla Ventures and Intel Capital Corporation.

The acquisition is due to close by the end of the third quarter (September) this year.

Jordan Wu, President and CEO of Himax said in a statement: 'Google is a preeminent global technology leader.

'Beginning the second quarter of this year, we had already begun expanding capacity to meet demand for our LCOS product line.'

Google's Glass device has a screen fitted to the right lens that lets wearers search the internet, read maps, text messages and emails, take photos and videos.
