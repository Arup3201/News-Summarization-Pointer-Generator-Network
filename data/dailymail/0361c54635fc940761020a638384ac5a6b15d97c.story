Life cut short: Ryan Freel, 36, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound

Former baseball player Ryan Freel, who spent eight seasonsÂ  has died - two years after retiring from the game. He was 36 years old.

He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to reports.

Freel's major league career spanned eight seasons with various teams, but he was a fan favorite with the Cincinnati Reds, where he spent six years.

He was found dead on Saturday afternoon at his home in Jacksonville, Florida, after he had turned a shotgun on himself, according to the Florida Times-Union.

Freel, a utility infielder, was known for his hustle on the field and the time he spent working with local charities off the field.

The team said in a statement to MLB.com: 'The Reds family is deeply saddened to hear of the death of Ryan Freel. His teammates and our fans loved him for how hard he played the game, and he loved giving back to the community.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.'

He was the subject of a bizarre 2006 interview with U-T San Diego, when he claimed he spoke to a voice in his head he had named 'Farney.'

Freel
told the paper: '[Farney is] a little guy who lives in my head who 
talks to me and I talk to him. That little midget in my head said, "That
was a great catch, Ryan," I said, "Hey, Farney, I don't know if that 
was you who really caught that ball, but that was pretty good if it 
was."'

Longtime Reds teammate Sean Casey 
tweeted on Saturday night: 'RIP Ryan Freel!! Great teammate, great guy,n
loved his family! Such a sad day today with his passing!Awful 
news!Prayers are with his family!'

Freel
retired from baseball in 2010 after he was released by the Texas 
Rangers, but he remained in the baseball world, coaching young players 
in the Jacksonville area.

His suicide comes weeks after the death of another athlete that shocked the football world.

Javon Belcher of the Kansas City Chiefs shot his girlfriend and the mother of his child several times on December 1 before driving to the Chiefs practice facility at Arrowhead Stadium, where he killed himself in front of his head coach and the team's general manager.

Freel leaves behind his wife Christie and three daughters.
