Self-confessed arachnophobe Aaron Perlman got the fright of his life when a spider fell on him during a live weather broadcast this week.

The Bakersfield, California forecaster was presenting a segment for KBAK/KBFX when a spider dropped from the ceiling and brushed past his bald head.

Bakersfield Now footage shows the award-winning weatherman immediately turning on his heel and shuddering.

'Oh my gosh, did you guys see that?' he asked the program anchors while stroking his head and laughing.

'Oh my gosh, did you see that?': Meteorologist Aaron Perlman from HLN affiliate, KBAK in Bakersfield, was startled when he felt a creepy-crawly fall on his head

'There was a spider that fell!' Perlman laughed and shuddered after a spider fell on him during a weather broadcast

When the program anchors jokingly told him to 'take it easy', the freaked out weather presenter explained his reaction.

'I hate spiders, man,' he said smiling, as the show's hosts laughed. 'Especially when youâ€™re bald,
 you feel â€˜em crawling on your head.'

But the veteran broadcaster's fear of spiders didn't stop him from continuing the broadcast.

'Alright I apologize. I'm just creeped out right now! ... I'm not standing by that wall,' he said, as he moved to the side of the screen.

But not one to miss an opportunity, Perlman leaped across the set and stomped on the spider when he spotted it on the floor.

'That just scares me,' he said.

As the Bakersfield Now video went viral online, the former So You Think You Can Dance? auditionee took to his Facebook page to explain his little freak-out.

'Yes... I am afraid of spiders. But let's be honest... who isn't? Now if I could have only turned into Spider-Man,' he wrote.
