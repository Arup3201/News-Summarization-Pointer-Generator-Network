The game at the very top level is fast approaching an age whereby prudence pays. Although there is a deal of scepticism as to whether UEFA can fully enforce their stringent Financial Fair Play rules, there is a definite sea change afoot.

With that in mind, the rise in pre-contract agreements could be a steep one in the coming years. Free transfers are nothing new - and do cost clubs hefty amounts in inflated sign-on fees - with some managers hoping to get business done early.

And in truth, those in the Premier League are planning for next August now. There are a raft of players from across the world who are available to sign ahead of the 2015-16 season; scouts up and down the country try to remain two steps ahead - forever looking two transfer windows in front of themselves. If they’re not looking, others certainly are.

Brendan Rodgers will already be on the hunt for new faces to help strengthen his Liverpool squad 

Simply put, a club can talk to any player who plies his trade in another country out of contract in June 2015 from New Year's Day about signing at the end of this season. They can put pen to paper on a deal, with a target committing to a contract before his current one expires. Dani Alves, for example, is available should Chelsea feel the need for another right back, but Steven Gerrard - also a free agent in seven months - is off limits to domestic rivals for now. 

So, who could they be scouting as we count down to January? Sportsmail takes a look at the available stars on pre-contract agreements in two months’ time - firstly in an XI format, and then with a collection of notable others.

Sergio Romero (Sampdoria) 

Interest: Manchester United, Liverpool

The man who saved two Holland penalties in the World Cup semi-final could well be leaving Serie A at the end of this season. Argentina's stopper - who was shortlisted for the Golden Glove award in Brazil - would be very handy for most sides. One wonders whether Brendan Rodgers fancies deploying someone down at Stadio Luigi Ferraris.

Dani Alves (Barcelona)

Has already made it clear that he won’t be staying at the Nou Camp beyond his current contract and would represent an exciting prospect for almost every side in Europe. A veteran of the Champions League but still with the vibrancy a full back in England requires, the Brazilian will have many suitors.

Giorgio Chiellini (Juventus)

Interest: Manchester United, Manchester City 

Whether the Old Lady’s skipper pens new terms in Turin remains to be seen - it certainly isn’t beyond the realm of possibility - but the central defender will have a few in his ear. With Juventus having won the last three titles - a fourth appears to be on its way - Chiellini may fancy a change, particularly given he’s only played in Serie A.

Right back Alves has 79 caps for Brazil and formed part of the back four at the Nou Camp for the last six years

Basle central defender Fabian Schar was partly responsible for Mario Balotelli's dismal night in Switzerland

John Terry, Michael Carrick, Anderson, Danny Ings, Connor Wickham, Morgan Amalfitano, James Milner, Glen Johnson, Emmanuel Adebayor, Mathieu Flamini, Bryan Ruiz, Mark Noble, Ron Vlaar, Steven Gerrard, Mikel Arteta, Winston Reid, Fabian Delph, Youssuf Mulumbu, Maya Yoshida, Claudio Yacob

Fabian Schar (FC Basle) 

Interest: Arsenal 

One of the emerging central defenders in Europe and with designs of bigger things. Excellent against Liverpool in the continent’s premier competition only a matter of weeks ago and has plenty of admirers. Only 22 so would require a compensation fee to be paid, but that would come out at less than Basle’s asking price otherwise.

Alvaro Pereira (Sao Paulo)

Interest: Tottenham 

Uruguay’s chosen left back during the summer World Cup, Pereira was the man to continue playing despite a heavy clash with Raheem Sterling in England’s group stage defeat. Loves to gallop forward.

Sami Khedira (Real Madrid)

Interest: Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City 

The real standout player available to clubs who want to get their business done swiftly. It’s no secret as to Khedira’s obvious ability - with Arsenal interested in the central midfielder - and, although his wages will undoubtedly be high, not many would pass up the opportunity to add the German.

Rasmus Elm (CSKA Moscow)

Interest: Arsenal, Manchester United 

Perhaps someone who will peak the interest of those beneath the top six in the Premier League, Elm is a classy midfielder on the ball but also has a height advantage over most. Those attributes - plus possessing an excellent engine - make the Swede desirable.

Yevhen Konoplyanka (Dnipro)

Interest: Liverpool, Tottenham 

Liverpool failed to sign the winger last January because Dnipro dug their heels in, but the Ukrainian side must be regretting that now. Interest is high for the jinking creator and he is certain to leave on a free. It’s a matter of who gets there first.

Andre Ayew (Marseille)

Interest: Liverpool, West Ham 

Always one who is talked about when a window comes around, and January will be no different. Marseille won’t see any value in taking the money and running, so it’ll be interesting to see who courts the Ghanaian livewire.

Eduardo Vargas is on loan at Queens Park Rangers from Rafa Benitez's Napoli in Serie A

The Chilean has impressed for Harry Redknapp's side this season, notably against Liverpool at Loftus Road

Eduardo Vargas (Napoli, on loan at Queens Park Rangers)

Interest: QPR, Arsenal 

Is QPR merely a shop window for the Chilean? Perhaps, perhaps not. Harry Redknapp will be well aware Vargas is out of contract and - should Rangers have designs of consolidating in the Premier League, they could do a lot worse than to get this one sorted. The one thing that may work against them is question marks over which division they’ll be in next year.

Luiz Adriano (Shakhta Donetsk)

Interest: Arsenal, Tottenham, Liverpool 

Simply put, the striker cannot stop scoring. It’s nine (yes, nine) goals in the Champions League already, including five away at BATE Borisov. He is a late developer and an unknown commodity but had a hand in two on his Brazil debut against Turkey on Wednesday night.

The Shakhtar Donetsk striker can't stop scoring in the Champions League - he has nine already this term 

Stipe Pletikosa (FC Rostov) 

At 35, the goalkeeper - with 114 caps for Croatia before retiring from international football - may be looking for one last move before he calls it a day for good. Would surely only act as a No 2, but definitely someone who could act as reliable cover. 

Nigel De Jong (AC Milan) 

Looking for that little bit of added steel in midfield? De Jong may well be your man. A fierce competitor and someone who Manchester City have missed a touch this season. 

Maxi Pereira (Benfica)

Bombs forward from right back and one of the more exuberant fliers to watch in Europe.

Maxi Pereira (in action for Benfica against Monaco) is lightning and exciting to watch on the right

Ignazio Abate (AC Milan)

Played in Italy's back four during the World Cup and did so impressively. A good age at 28. 

Yoann Gourcuff (Lyon)

Has never scored enough goals given his position and the quality he has, but would still provide a touch of class to a range of sides. 

Andre-Pierre Gignac (Marseille)

Not keen on signing a new deal, with the striker - linked with Arsenal and Newcastle - seemingly on his way.
