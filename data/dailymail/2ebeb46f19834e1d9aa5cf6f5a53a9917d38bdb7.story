Ali Hasan flashes the victory sign after being released from prison ahead of his trial on June 20

An 11-year-old boy arrested for allegedly taking part in anti-government protests has been freed ahead of his trial.

Ali Hasan says he was playing in the streets near his him in  al-Bilad al-Qadeem, a suburb of the Bahrain capital, Manama, with two other children his age when he was arrested for 'joining an illegal gathering' and other claims.

Protests have been held in Sadad calling for his release for the last month, and that finally happened on Monday evening according to his lawyer, Mohsen al-Alawi.

The sixth-grade student sat his exams while in prison and is among the youngest suspects detained in crackdowns on protests led by Bahrain's Shiite majority which seeks a greater political voice from the ruling Sunni dynasty.

He will appear before the court again on June 20.

Hasan said the two boys he was playing with ran off after being approached by plain clothes police officers in a car.

One of the officers ordered him to stop or he would shoot if he tried to get away and he was later ordered to identify other boys where he lived.

Among the accusations the 11-year-old faces is the allegation that he blocked a road with a rubbish skip, but his lawyer, Shahzalan Khamees, said this was impossible because 'you would need two grown men to lift it'.

He was moved to different police stations for the first four hours of his detention, according to the Independent, in order to disorientate him.

Mrs Khamees said: 'He 
is very sad all the time. All he says is "I want to 
go home. I want my mother". He is frightened and says they are going to 
punish him. He is only a child.'

It is not the first time that the 
Bahrain authorities have been accused of targeting school children - 
three teenage school girls said they were beaten in custody by the 
police there in May last year.

More than 50 people have died in Bahrain since unrest began in February and martial law was imposed after mass rallies.

Martial law was declared after rallies of up to 200,000 people took place.

The monarchy set about crushing demonstrations by calling in troops from  Sunni Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Last November, an international inquiry into the brutal crackdown found that ‘excessive and unnecessary force’ had been used and that detainees suffered electric shocks, and beatings with rubber hoses and wires.

There are continued reports of arrests and torture at the hands of the Sunni authorities. In March this year, the UN asked for the Bahrain government to investigate allegations that tear gas, rubber bullets and birdshot pellets were being used against protesters.  

Eight opposition leaders have been sentenced to life in prison and a Bahrain policewoman is currently on trial for torturing a French TV journalist who was taken into custody. 

Earlier this week, Nabeel Rajab, head of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, was arrested after tweeting a comment that criticised the Gulf nation’s ruling caste.
