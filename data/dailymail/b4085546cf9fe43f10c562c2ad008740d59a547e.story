A middle-aged man has been taken to hospital after his friend used a firefighting plane to drop 400 gallons of water on him as part of the Ice Bucket Challenge.

The 51-year-old, from Belgium, was taken to hospital over fears he may have suffered internal injuries during the stunt Empuriabrava aerodrome in Catalonia, Spain.

But doctors have now confirmed he only received minor wounds and is recovering in Girona hospital.

According to Rolf Kuratle, head of Skydive Empuriabrava which runs trips from the aerodrome, the victim had set the stunt up with a friend who had been flying the plane.

He told The Local: 'They had arranged to do it as part of the Ice Bucket Challenge craze in order to raise money for ALS. 

'The pilot flew a fire-fighting plane, the kind used to put out forest fires, and dumped the load onto his friend. They obviously miscalculated how much water it was.'

Other Ice Bucket fails include one girl who was videoed running into a metal pole just after having freezing water dumped over her head, and another who fell off a horse after drenching herself while sitting on the animal's back.

The accident happened at Empuriabrava aerodrome in Catalonia, Spain. Initial medics believed the middle-aged victim may have suffered internal injuries, but it turned out that he was not seriously hurt

Jesean Morris, 20, a fugitive from Omaha, Nebraska, was even arrested after posting an Ice Bucket video on his Facebook page which police used to trace his whereabouts.

Morris was on parole following his release from the Omaha Correctional Center where he was serving time  for assault and use of a firearm during a crime when he posted the video.

The Ice Bucket Challenge started in America but has since taken social media by storm, raising £37million for research into ALS, a degenerative condition also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease.
