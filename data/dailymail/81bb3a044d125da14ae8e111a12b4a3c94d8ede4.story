Angel di Maria looked in some discomfort on the Manchester United bench on Monday night, holding an ice pack to his groin during the 2-2 draw with West Bromwich Albion.

The Argentine, United's record signing, was impressive at the Hawthorns, but there was some concern over the midfielder after he came off in the 76th minute.

Di Maria has been in superb form since his £60million move from Real Madrid in the summer, and continued his impressive start in the Monday night clash.

He set up Marouane Fellaini for his equaliser just after half-time, before making way for Ashley Young.

There was concern on the United bench, too, with Chris Smalling, Ander Herrera and Ryan Giggs looking at Di Maria as the physio wrapped his leg. 

He has played five games for Manchester United so far, scoring three goals and assisting four more. 

Ashley Young was sent on for United's record buy, who had already made his fourth assist of the season

Louis van Gaal insists Manchester United can still close the gap to Chelsea at the top of the Barclays Premier League, with his side now 10 points behind the leaders.

He said: 'That's possible but difficult to say because then I am arrogant. But I have done it a lot of times.

'It is two points lost. I think we were the better team and I am very disappointed by the result. We were two times behind but I don't think West Bromwich Albion created too many chances.'
