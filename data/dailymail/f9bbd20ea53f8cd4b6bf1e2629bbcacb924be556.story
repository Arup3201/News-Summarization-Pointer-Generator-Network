Stuart Attwell, the Premier League's youngest ever referee, has been handed a shock recall more than two years after being axed.

Attwell, who made history at 25, takes charge of Leicester City versus West Bromwich Albion on Saturday.

It will be his first top-flight game since January 1, 2012, when he took charge of West Brom's home defeat to Everton.

Attwell, now 32, was subsequently demoted following a series of controversial calls.

The Nuneaton official was also suffering the psychological fall-out from awarding an infamous 'ghost goal' to Reading at Watford in 2008 when the ball clearly went wide of the post.

However, Attwell has shown the application and fortitude to rebuild his career in the Football League and after some impressive performances in the Championship, Professional Game Match Officials Ltd have rewarded him with a comeback.

He has also been handed  Manchester City's Capital One Cup tie with Newcastle on Wednesday, a chance for the official to get used to the pace of the Premier League before he returns to the competition itself.

He remains young enough to have a long-lasting career at the top if he capitalises on his second chance.

Watford vs Reading, September 2008

A Reading corner was deflected over the goal-line, with Noel Hunt attempting unsuccessfully to flick it back into play. Assistant Nigel Bannister flagged for a goal, and Attwell awarded it.

What they said: 'Probably the worst decision I've ever witnessed in football,' according to Stephen Hunt - and he played for Reading.

Derby County vs Nottingham Forest, November 2008

Attwell disallowed two Derby goals in the final few minutes and showed a straight red card to Forest midfielder Lewis McGugan.

What they said: Derby manager Paul Jewell accused Attwell of 'losing control' and 'robbing' his team of a win.

Manchester City vs Wigan, April 2010

Gary Caldwell was shown a straight red card for a foul on Carlos Tevez, but the Latics defender looked to have played the ball and only struck his opponent with a trailing leg.

What they said: Wigan manager Roberto Martínez: 'To give a decision after something you don't see, that is lying. You are making it up.'

Stoke vs Bolton, April 2010

Matt Taylor scored  with a low free-kick with five minutes remaining. Attwell had allowed Stoke to play on before awarding the free-kick after Bolton substitute Vladimir Weiss went to ground.

What they said: Stoke defender Danny Higginbotham claimed Attwell was influenced by 'who shouted the loudest'.

Liverpool vs Sunderland, September 2010

Attwell allowed a Dirk Kuyt goal after Michael Turner had touched a free-kick to goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who believed the ball was still dead. Fernando Torres nicked it from him and set up Kuyt.

What they said: Sunderland boss Steve Bruce called the decision 'a joke'.

Bolton vs Tottenham, December 2011

Attwell showed Gary Cahill a straight red card for denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity with a professional foul on Scott Parker, who was 10 yards from the halfway line.

What they said: Bolton manger Owen Coyle was 'totally bemused'. Chairman Phil Gartside added it was an 'absolute disgrace'.
