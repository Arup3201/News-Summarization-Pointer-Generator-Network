War and Peace, one of the greatest novels of all time, is to be turned into an epic television drama by the BBC.

Leo Tolstoy's classic book will be made into a six-part series, it has been announced today.

It will written by the award-winning scriptwriter Andrew Davies,  who is best known for his adaptations of Pride and Prejudice, Little Dorrit and Bleak House.

Although the castings have yet to be announced, Les Miserables star Eddie Redmayne has been tipped to take up one of leading roles.

BBC controller Danny Cohen said: 'War And Peace is truly epic in scale and builds on BBC One's commitment to bringing audiences drama of the highest quality and impact.

'Told over six episodes, Andrew Davies will bring his exceptional powers of adaptation to this literary masterpiece.'

The adaptation will be screened on BBC One in 2015 and will be the first adaptation of the novel on British television for 40 years.

The iconic book was transformed into a memorable 20-part series in 1972, starring Anthony Hopkins.

First published in 1869, the book follows the lives of aristocratic families affected by the French invasion of Russia in the early 19th century.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest novels of all time, Andrew Davies scripts are expected to draw all the elements into powerful focus for a modern audience.

Veteran screenwriter Davies, who also scripted the Bridget Jones films and the popular ITV drama Mr Selfridge, said: 'Not just a great novel, it’s a wonderful read and it’ll make a wonderful serial.

'A thrilling, funny and heartbreaking story of love, war and family life.

'The characters are so natural and human and easy to identify with and Natasha Rostova just beats Lizzy Bennet as the most lovable heroine in literature.'

Davies has said that although he won't dumb down the novel, it will contain all the drama of Britain's best-loved soap operas.

He said the adaptation will focus less on the philosophical strands, and more on the human relationships, romance and family struggles.

Davies played down the notorious length of the original novel, which has a total of 1,225 pages.

'It's nothing to be frightened of. These people are just like us; their emotions are so recognisable,' he told the Telegraph.

'At the heart of the book, it is a story of four families, with certain characters we get to care about and love very much.'

He joked that the interaction between characters and families would be 'very familiar' to fans of the soap opera Eastenders, but with 'not so much yelling and nobody on the dole'.

Davies has expressed his desire to cast an unknown actress to play Natasha Rostova.

But he said the roles of male protagonists Pierre and Andrei will be played by more experienced actors.

Actor and model Eddie Redmayne is the favourite to play one of the lead roles, but Bafta award-winning writer Davies refused to speculate about prospective stars.

War and Peace was last shown on the BBC in 1972, with Sir Anthony Hopkins in the role of Pierre, while Audrey Hepburn starred in a film version in 1956.

Faith Penhale, executive producer and 
head of drama at BBC Wales, said: 'Andrew Davies is the master of the 
classic adaptation and it’s thrilling to be able to bring War And Peace,
with its rich cast of characters and epic drama, to BBC One.

'Today’s
audience will be drawn into the sweeping story of life and love during a
time of conflict, with a dazzling production that brings to life the 
great vision and scale of the novel.'
