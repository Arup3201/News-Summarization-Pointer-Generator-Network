England's remarkably serene build-up to the World Cup includes agreeing player bonuses for Brazil with the minimum of fuss well in advance of the big kick-off.

The squad are understood to be on around £350,000 each for winning the tournament, with the deal heavily incentivised for progressing through the group stage.

The terms were settled last January, with Club England having set financial parameters. The smooth negotiations were helped by the current good relationship between the FA and the players’ representatives, which has not always been the case.

Resolved: England have already tackled the issue of bonus money well ahead of the World Cup

This is in stark contrast to the troubles other competing teams, especially Nigeria and Cameroon, have encountered.

The team, as they do for all international appearances, will donate World Cup match fees to charity.

And the bonuses, despite being a hefty figure, are relatively insignificant for a squad of millionaires, with Wayne Rooney earning £300,000 a week at Manchester United.

The importance of sports psychiatrist Steve Peters to England’s World Cup challenge was demonstrated by manager Roy Hodgson inviting him to sit in on the media interviews he did on Thursday, with Hodgson wanting to utilise Peters’ ‘huge brain’ as much as he can.

Also present at the manager and captain media conferences were coach Gary Neville and three young players - Ross Barkley, Jon Flanagan and John Stones - though one can’t imagine Neville encouraging the trio to be helpful with the press.

Guidance: Gary Neville will be Roy Hodgson's number two in Brazil

New kid on the block: Ross Barkley is one of England's Young Lions who will be hoping to have a real impact

Former football journalist Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the German football federation, has emerged as a potential UEFA candidate to take on Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency. UEFA want Blatter to face a proper opponent and Niersbach fits the bill. And the 63-year-old, with powerful federation backing, would be not be derailed by defeat.

Roy Hodgson has rather less of a World Cup pedigree than the great Pele. But both are World Cup ambassadors for Swiss watchmakers Hublot, with special timepieces named after them.

There’s a Hublot Classic Fusion Pele and a Hublot King Power 66 Hodgson which Roy’s son Chris, a former Hublot employee, helped design. Hodgson Snr, asked what he would rescue first if his house was on fire, nominated his watch collection.

Pedigree: Roy Hodgson has World Cup experience after taking Switzerland to the USA in 1994

More pedigree: Pele has won three World Cups, more than any other player in history

Cellino World Cup ruck

The Leeds ownership fiasco since Massimo Cellino took charge has even started to have an impact on the 2015 Rugby World Cup.

The Italian, who has embarked on a heavy cost-cutting exercise, is said to be no lover of rugby union and has been questioning with ER 2015 every aspect of the contract he has inherited for two games — Italy v Canada on September 26 and Scotland v USA on September 27 — to be held at Elland Road.

It’s understood Cellino wants to know what the exact cost will be for Leeds and how they will benefit, right down to the bar takings.

An ER 2015 spokeswoman said: ‘We have a good working relationship with Leeds United and with Leeds City Council, who have plans to capitalise on tourism and the visitor economy through hosting two RWC games.’

Meanwhile beleaguered Ticketmaster, whose faulty computer system caused considerable problems for London 2012 and the Commonwealth Games, at least managed to get through the first day of their World Cup tickets sale without crashing.

BBC Sport’s bizarre rules about their presenters working for other organisations somehow allowed Garry Richardson to promote bookmaking firm Unibet with Graeme Swann despite cricket’s serious match-fixing issues.

Yet Jonathan Agnew is prevented from supporting Waitrose’s sponsorship of Test cricket. After questions about the Unibet advertising on Sky Sports during Wednesday’s ODI at Old Trafford, a Beeb spokeswoman said: ‘After consulting with BBC, Garry will not be doing any further work for Unibet.’
