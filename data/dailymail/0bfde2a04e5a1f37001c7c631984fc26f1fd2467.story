Texas officials are renewing demands the federal government take further steps to secure the border as waves of illegal immigrants are turning military bases into makeshift settlements.

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX) said ‘our military bases are turning into refugee camps. I never thought I'd see this in the United States of America’ during an appearance Thursday at the border near McAllen.

Texas Governor Rick Perry, also a Republican, demanded ‘Secure this border, Mr. President’ in a separate speech.

McCaul also claimed the President’s series of executive actions have made it easier for minors to stay in the country and put them at even greater risk for harm.

‘These children are often subjected to beatings, starvation, sexual assault and are at risk of being trafficked,’ said McCaul, according to Fox News.

‘Allowing them to remain here will only encourage the next group of individuals to undertake this very dangerous,’ Perry added.

Both men’s remarks came as many border towns have seen an influx of people illegally crossing the U.S. – Mexico border only to end up in temporary prisons and makeshift settlements before they are processed and either deported or sent elsewhere.

A significant number of these immigrants are now unaccompanied minors who end up in lockups like the widely-publicized one at a former bus station in McAllen, or are found dead in the desert – like a young girl was this week.

Those that do survive the perilous journey are then taken to a Houston airport and flown around the country to various shelters, according to Buzzfeed.

The hub, in a staging area away from the public at the Bush Intercontinental Airport… is intended to reduce the amount of time it takes to transfer custody of the minors to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which runs the shelters, the site reported.

Those children, mainly from destitute Central American countries, started being taken to military bases across the country last month, according to Buzzfeed.

Some of those bases include Fort Sill, in Oklahoma, and Lackland Air Force Base, in texas, according to Fox News.

Many top government officials, including House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi (D- CA), have visited the porous border carved by the Rio Grande River.

President Obama earlier this week sought $2billion in emergency aid to help open more detention centers across the country to provide ‘basic humanitarian needs,’ according to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.

‘That's why the president has asked for additional resources from Congress to open up detention facilities across the country, where these individuals can be housed in humane conditions’

Governor Perry still blasted the feds after announcing a $1.3 million-per-week program to ferry state agents to the border.

Those agents are expected to bolster border patrol efforts, said Perry, according to Fox.

The Governor also called for Washington to pay back the $500million Texas has spent on border security the past 10 years, Fox reported.

‘We have been fulfilling a federal responsibility,’ said Perry, whose own bid to run for president during the 2012 election fizzled out before the Republican convention.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) also called for Obama to take a tougher stance on minors crossing the border without their parents ‘who are already in the United States illegally,’ he told Fox.

He claimed the parents ‘had a role in smuggling the minors into the United States.’

More than 52,000 unaccompanied minors have been snagged by the border patrol since October, and the number is steadily rising.
