As plenty of parents will know, being a working mother involves making some difficult decisions. But few will have gone to quite the same lengths as handbag designer Anya Hindmarch.

The businesswoman revealed yesterday that she 'fired herself' from her job because the pressure of juggling her work with raising five children became too much.

Miss Hindmarch – a close friend of Samantha Cameron – made the decision to step down as chief executive of her self-titled firm, although she has remained as chief creative officer of the company.

The 46-year-old, who designed the sought-after 'I am not a plastic bag' tote, said: 'I have just fired myself as CEO.

'I was CEO and obviously overseeing the creative side of the business. And I think the business had grown too big, really, for me. I was working every hour God sends and, with lots of children, that is quite hard.'

Miss Hindmarch – whose popular Be A Bag range allows shoppers to personalise their designer totes and washbags with treasured family photographs – has five children aged 11 to 25 with her 59-year-old husband James Seymour, the company's financial director.

She made the comments at the British Chambers of Commerce's international trade conference, where she spoke of the challenges of juggling family life with running a global multi-million pound company – admitting that her children had come to consider deep-fried chicken as 'home cooking'.

But despite deciding to scale back her role in the business, she insisted her family benefited from seeing her enjoy her career. She said she believed 'children remember mood more than they do actual presence', adding: 'If you are happy and you have had a really thrilling day, your children will recognise that and be very proud of you.

'So I think do what you need to do. I love working and I think my kids get out a kick out of it too and I would say include them. My children have played hide and seek for years in the basement, my stationery cupboard.'

Miss Hindmarch, who was awarded an MBE in 2009, took the decision to step down as CEO three years ago, replacing herself with former Harrods and Gucci executive James McArthur. She launched her fashion label in 1987, and these days her brightly coloured leather handbags regularly sell for more than £1,000 each.

The brand now has 56 stores in 17 countries, but its headquarters are still in London.
