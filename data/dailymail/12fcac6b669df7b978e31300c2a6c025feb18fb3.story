Temperatures are set to plummet again as March comes to an end, prolonging one of the worst winters on record. 

A cold bast will sweep across the East coast this week and cause the mercury to fall between 10 and 15 degrees below average. 

Areas of the Deep South such as Alabama, Middle Georgia and the Carolinas could also freeze.

The jet stream is forcing the arctic breeze down from Canada and will impact a huge swathe of the country to the east of the Mississippi river. 

On Saturday Michigan's Upper Peninsula plunged below zero, while it barely reached the teens in southern West Virginia.

It comes after a changeable week where temperatures in the 60s and 70s hit Washington D.C. and Philadelphia while Boston, which has seen one of its worst winters on record, hit the 50s. 

Towards the end of the week it started to get colder, and there was even a flurry of snow in New York on Saturday.  

If the current trend of cold weather carries on, Boston will record its coldest February through March period in 130 years - when Grover Cleveland was President.

A storm last weekend dropped 2.9 inches of snow at Logan International Airport, pushing the seasonal accumulation to 108.6 inches and surpassing the previous record of 107.6 set in 1995-96.

The frigid temperatures will continue into Sunday, but they will rise back up towards average by next week 

The season snowfall record is measured from July 1 through June 30. Records go back to 1872. 

This is the same at New York's JFK and LaGuardia Airports, as well as Bridgeport, Connecticut.  

The cold air is set to be pushed away by the beginning of next week, according to Weather.com, and temperatures will be remain around average for the rest of the month.
