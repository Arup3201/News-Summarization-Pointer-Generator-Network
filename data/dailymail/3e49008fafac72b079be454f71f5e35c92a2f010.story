With less than a second left on the clock, a high school basketball star as he fires an incredible 55-foot 'buzzer beater' to win a championship clash by a single point.

Khalil Edney, a 6-foot-2 senior guard for New Rochelle High School, looped the ball into the basket from his own half to propel his team to a state regional semifinal on Sunday afternoon.

The unbelievable shot was the climax of a thrilling grudge match against arch rivals Mount Vernon high school at the Westchester County Center, in White Plains, New York.

Speaking after the game, Edney, who alsoÂ 
quarterbacked the school's football team to the state title, said: 'We ran the play where we get the ball 
to halfcourt, but they were doubling Joe (Clarke).

'They got the ball 
and threw it back to their basket to one of his teammates.'

'I had to get the shot off as fast as I could.'

'That is my first buzzer-beater on a three-pointer in high school to win a game,' the schoolboy added. 'Winning a state football title was a great feeling, but this is just as good because of the way it happened.'
