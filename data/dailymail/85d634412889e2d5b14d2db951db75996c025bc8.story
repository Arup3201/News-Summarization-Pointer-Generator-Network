On the move: Ignasi Miquel will join Norwich 

Arsenal are set to accept a £1.5million offer from Norwich for defender Ignasi Miquel.

The Spaniard has struggled to establish himself in the Gunners' first-team and has been told he can leave the Emirates Stadium ahead of Monday's transfer deadline.

Manager Arsene Wenger has been forced into rethinking his plan to offload Miquel this summer following the departure of Thomas Vermaelen.

The Belgian's exit has left Arsenal short of central-defensive cover, nevertheless the decision has been taken to allow the 21-year-old to leave.

It was originally though Miquel's protracted move to Carrow Road would be on loan, but it is understood the Canaries want to take him on a permanent deal.

The news means that Arsenal are almost certain to sign a new defender before the transfer window closes on Monday.

They have seen attempts to sign Kostas Manolas fail after the Greek defender joined Roma.

Arsenal are now weighing up a move for Borussia Dortmund defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos.
