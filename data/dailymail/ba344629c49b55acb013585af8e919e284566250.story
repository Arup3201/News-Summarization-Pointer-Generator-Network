This adorable Russian baby may have a cute and innocent-looking face.

But as soon as they find something funny, their sinister laugh makes them sound like an evil super-villain from a Hollywood film.

The footage shows the baby appearing to be sitting in a car seat and as the camera films their face.

The infant obviously finds something amusing as a big smile spreads across their face before bursting into a fit of giggles.

But rather than a high-pitched child-like chuckle, the youngster lets out a long, evil sounding cackle.

They then pause for a second and it looks as though they may cry but after they are laughing again in their own unique way.

It is unknown who the baby in the footage is, although it is believed the video originated in Russia.

It is also unclear exactly what made them laugh continuously for almost 40 seconds.

The clip has also been uploaded to Youtube, where it has gone viral, receiving more than 1million views since being published two days ago.

The Russian description for the video labels it as 'The most sarcastic baby in the world'.

Meanwhile in English the clip is described as 'the child who laughs like a troll'.
