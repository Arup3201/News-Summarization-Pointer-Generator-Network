A photograph of a well-dressed black man holding a baby is reportedly of George Zimmerman's great-grandfather - and could become a crucial piece of evidence in his murder trial.

CNN aired the picture last night and if its authenticity can be verified then it supports what the accused murderer's family have been saying since the shooting took place - that Zimmerman is from a mixed-race family and did not kill Trayvon Martin because he was black.

The 28-year-old's family and legal team have repeatedly asserted that he killed the unarmed 17-year-old on February 26 out of self defense rather than because of his race.

He is awaiting trial on a second-degree murder charge and has been accused of racial profiling in the shooting death of Trayvon - whose death caused mass protests all over the country.

National civil rights leaders and campaigners were up in arms when Zimmerman was not charged over the teen's death. Police cited Florida's 'Stand Your Ground' Law in their decision.

Florida, which has some of the most lenient gun laws in the nation, 
enacted the self-defense measure in 2005, which provides people wide 
latitude to use deadly force if they fear bodily harm. The law is now in
 effect in more than 20 states.

Trayvon was walking through the gated 
Florida community where George Zimmerman was a neighborhood watch guard 
when he was shot and killed. He was unarmed.

Zimmerman
 said the teen attacked him, knocking him to the ground and bashing his 
head into the sidewalk. He pulled the trigger of his 9mm handgun in self
 defense, he claims.

After initial questioning from police that night, he was released without charge.

Zimmerman's family members have insisted for months that he is no racist.

Orlando attorney Mark NeJame appeared 
on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight on Thursday with the photo and said it 
originated from someone in the family.

The
 man is Zimmerman's great-grandfather, NeJame told the network, the baby
 is Zimmerman's mother and the young woman is his grandmother.

Loss: Sybrina Fulton is facing her first Mother's Day without her son Trayvon

Last month, an investigation by Reuters portrayed George Zimmerman as a trusted aid to most of his black neighbors in the gated community of Sanford, Florida that was plagued by a string of burglaries in the weeks leading up to the shooting of Trayvon Martin.

The 28-year-old insurance-fraud investigator comes from a deeply Catholic background and was raised in a racially integrated household.Â 

It emerged this week he waived his right to a speedy trial while his legal team prepares his defense.

The mother of Florida shooting victim Trayvon Martin appears in a Mother's Day gun control video produced by an advocacy group led by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Noting that 'this will be my first Mother's Day without my son, Trayvon,' Sybrina Fulton asks viewers to urge their state governors 'to re-examine similar Stand Your Ground laws throughout the nation to keep our families safe.'

'Nobody can bring our children back,' Fulton says in the video, released on Thursday to several websites by a Bloomberg-led gun control coalition called Second Chance on Shoot First.

'But it would bring us comfort if we can help spare other mothers the pain that we will feel on Mother's Day and every day for the rest of our lives.'

Forty-five days after the shooting, following the appointment of a special prosecutor and protest marches across the country, Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder in the racially charged case.

He pleaded not guilty to the charge and is free on bail.

Mayor Bloomberg often refers to the Stand Your Ground laws as 'shoot first' laws.

'I hope Sybrina Fulton's courage will persuade state legislators to take a second look at shoot first laws and take a second chance to get them right,' he said in a statement.

Bloomberg is one of the nation's most outspoken mayors on the issue of gun control. He has crafted gun law legislation at the local and national level, formed a gun control coalition that counts at least 600 U.S. mayors, and in 2006 directed city attorneys to sue out-of-state gun dealers whose weapons were used in crimes in New York City.
