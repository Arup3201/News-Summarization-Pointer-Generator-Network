A Nigerian man accused of trying to
bring down an international jetliner with a bomb in his underwear 
walked into the start of his federal trial today and declared that a 
radical Islamic cleric killed by the U.S. military is alive.

Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's outburst came as jury selection got under way for his federal terror trial in Detroit, where the 24-year-old is acting as his own attorney and has previously told reporters they should stop reporting that Osama bin Laden was dead.

'Anwar is alive,' Abdulmutallab
said today, referring to American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who 
was killed last week by a joint CIA-U.S. military air strike in Yemen.

'The mujahadeen will wipe out the U.S. â€” the cancer U.S.,' he added.

Abdulmutallab,
a well-educated Nigerian from an upper-class family, was directed in 
the attack by al-Awlaki and wanted to become a martyr when he boarded 
Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in Amsterdam a Christmas 2009, according 
to the government.

Abdulmutallab,
who complained loudly at a previous hearing about having to wear prison
clothes, came into the courtroom today wearing an oversized prison 
T-shirt.

U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds called a brief recess to 
allow him to change into clothes more appropriate for court, after 
acknowledging and denying his apparent request to wear a 'Yemeni belt 
with a dagger.'

The judge has denied several of Adulmutallab's requests for the trial, including that the case be judged under Islamic law.

Abdulmutallab
has pleaded not guilty to eight charges, including conspiracy to commit
terrorism and attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.

The 
government says he wanted to blow up the plane by detonating chemicals 
in his underwear, just seven minutes before the jet carrying 279 
passengers and a crew of 11 was to land at Detroit Metropolitan Airport.

But the bomb didn't work, and passengers assisted by crew members saw flames and pounced on Abdulmutallab.

The
failed suicide attack, the first act of terrorism in the U.S. during 
the Obama administration, revealed the rise of a dangerous al-Qaida 
affiliate and al-Awlaki's growing influence.

The
government says Abdulmutallab willingly explained the plot twice, first
to U.S. border officers who took him off the plane and then in more 
detail to FBI agents who interviewed him at a hospital for 50 minutes, 
following treatment for serious burns to his groin.

Abdulmutallab
told authorities he trained in Yemen, home base for Al-Qaida in the 
Arabian Peninsula. He said he was influenced by al-Awlaki, who was 
killed Friday by an air strike that President Barack Obama called a 'major blow' to al-Qaida's most dangerous franchise.

Following
the strike, a U.S. official outlined new details of al-Awlaki's 
involvement against the U.S., including Abdulmutallab's alleged mission.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss 
intelligence matters, said al-Awlaki specifically directed Abdulmutallab
to detonate an explosive device over U.S. airspace to maximise 
casualties.

Osama bin Laden
appeared in a video declaring Abdulmutallab a 'hero.' Abdulmutallab 
also has been lauded by al-Qaida's English-language Web magazine 
Inspire, whose editor was killed along with al-Awlaki.

After
the outburst about al-Awlaki and flap over Abdulmutallab's clothes, 
jury selection got under way in earnest, with most questioning done by 
the judge and attorney Anthony Chambers, who has been appointed to 
assist Abdulmutallab.

Abdulmutallab,
who had suggested he would interview some prospective jurors and could 
give his own opening statement, calmly questioned one woman who 
indicated she had concerns about retaliation for serving on the jury.

The woman remained in the jury pool, but several others were immediately dismissed after saying they could not be impartial.
