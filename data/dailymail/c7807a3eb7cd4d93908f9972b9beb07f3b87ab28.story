Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes wants Kentuckians to know she is most definitely not President Barack Obama, and she even wields a gun in her latest campaign ad, released today to prove it. 

The entire 30-second ad takes place in a field where Grimes shoots skeet while she mocks Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, her opponent in the race, and lists off the issues she disagrees with the unpopular Democratic president on. 

'Mitch McConnell wants you to think I'm Barack Obama. Mitch is the same guy who thought Duke basketball players were UK,' Grimes says, referring to an ad the McConnell campaign released that confused the state's two college basketball teams.

Not Obama: Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes is so afraid of being associated with President Barack Obama that cut an ad explicitly telling voters she's not him

 

'I'm not Barack Obama,' Grimes later says straight to camera. 'I disagree with him on guns, coal and the EPA.

'And Mitch, that's not how you hold a gun,' she says, flashing a photo of  McConnell holding a gun upside down at the Conservative Political Action conference in March.

McConnell's gesture was a throwback to actor Charleston Heston's presentation at the National Rifle Association's annual convention in 2000, not a befuddled attempt at holding a fire arm.

The Grimes campaign sunk it's teeth into into the move however after a conservative news publication revealed that McConnell may not own a gun.

'Of course Sen. McConnell has shot a gun,' a spokesperson for McConnell's campaign told The Washington Examiner, 'but as a matter of principle he's not interested in helping the left bully people into revealing what protection they may keep in their own homes.'

McConnell's Senate staff wouldn't confirm to reporters whether the Republican politician owned a gun either.

In response to Grimes' ad hitting McConnell over the gun incident, Team Mitch campaign spokesperson Allison Moore said: 'An inexperienced Obama liberal with a gun is no less dangerous ‎for Kentucky families than one without. 

'Much of Alison Lundergan Grimes' financial support comes from those seeking to implement gun control and wage the war on coal but cynically she believes a recycled TV ad idea will fool Kentuckians,' she added.

Grimes shoots skeet in her video, however a handful of other House and Senate candidates released ads of themselves shooting copies of Obamacare and other legislation backed by the president to distance themselves from his policies.

In her ad Grimes makes fun of McConnell for not knowing his way around a firearm, as evidenced by this photo of him at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in March. McConnell was purposefully holding the gun upside down, however, in a throw back to a move made by actor Charlton Heston at another conservative conference more than a decade ago

While Grimes may know her way around a firearm better than her opponent, it's McConnell who has the backing of the largest gun lobbying organization.

The NRA endorsed McConnell in the race last week and gave him an A+ - it's highest rating - on Second Amendment rights.

'The true measure of leadership and courage comes during moments of adversity and Leader McConnell has stood steadfast with America’s law-abiding gun owners during the most trying of times,' Chris W. Cox, chairman of the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund said in a statement.

'He has fought against sweeping gun and ammo bans and supported substantive efforts that rightfully place the burden of our justice system on violent criminals. Leader McConnell also led the effort in the U.S. Senate last year to defeat Barack Obama and Michael Bloomberg’s gun control agenda.'

Grimes skeet shooting ad is the candidate's response to a 30-second ad McConnell's campaign put out last week that seeks to tie Grimes to Obamacare, the rising national debt, the flood of unaccompanied minors coming over the U.S.' southern border and Obama's claim that 'we don't have a strategy yet' to deal with ISIS in Syria.

As side by side photos of Obama and Grimes appear on screen, the ad's narrator claims that 'Obama needs Alison Grimes. Kentucky needs Mitch McConnell.'

The president has had a low approval rating among all Americans for several months, but he is especially unpopular in Kentucky.

A poll taken in May by several Kentucky news organizations found that just 29 percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of the president. A majority, 57 percent, said they did not have a positive opinion of him.

At the time, McConnell also had a low favorability rating, but Kentuckians have since warmed back up to McConnell faced with the prospect of electing Grimes instead.

'The people in Kentucky made up their mind about Mitch McConnell a long time ago. ... They would be happy to replace him but ... she hasn't given them any reasons to be for her,' Democratic consultant Danny Briscoe told The Courier Journal on Sunday.

'Something's got to be done a lot different,' he added, 'because what's happening isn't working.'

With less than 50 days until the election, McConnell is now leading Grimes by an average of five points in polls, according to multiple polls taken in the several weeks.
