Steve McManaman looked more like Inspector Gadget than an ex footballer when he appeared as a pundit before Hull and Newcastle's Premier League clash on Saturday.

 The former Real Madrid and Liverpool man's grey top hat and coat was reminiscent of the animated character as he appeared on BT Sport.

McManaman was offering his insight for relegation threatened Hull's clash at home to Newcastle.

Defeat for relegation threatened Hull would heap the pressure on manager Steve Bruce

Newcastle had a 1-0 lead over their hosts at half-time in the encounter.

Remy Cabella scored a wonderful goal after 40 minutes to put John Carver's side into the lead.

Defeat for Hull would pile the misery upon manager Steve Bruce, whose side would face the possibility of going bottom of the league if they lose, Queens Park Rangers at least take a point at Stoke and Leicester win against Manchester United.
