A U.S. Army paratrooper returned to Afghanistan late last year for his second tour of active combat duty less than two years after his left foot was amputated.

Lt. Joshua Pitcher lost the foot after it was blown apart two years ago by a roadside bomb. It has since been replaced with a carbon fiber prosthetic that allows him near full mobility.

The heroic 25-year-old overcame depression, heavy drinking and a 40-pill-a-day Oxycontin habit to return to the battlefield.

Pitcher’s injury occurred only two months after he arrived in the war-torn Middle Eastern country, in April 2012, when he stepped off the road to urinate, he told the Washington Post.

A sound similar to a firecracker went off just as he zipped up his pants.

‘I looked down at my foot, and I was like, ‘Uh-oh,’ he recalled to the paper. 

He was soon airlifted to a U.S. military hospital in Germany, and only days later – despite not having a left foot – posted defiantly to Facebook.

‘I will return,’ he wrote, and then confided in others that he planned to return as a paratrooper.

Pitcher was then transferred to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for rehabilitation.

‘And then I just spiraled down into complete depression,’ he recalled.

His recovery was progressing along until he demanded to be temporarily released for his then-fiancee Michelle’s college graduation.

‘They said, ‘Josh, it’s too early. You can’t go,’ his father Randy told the Post.

‘’No, I am going,’ Pitcher responded, according to his father. ‘Take the damn IVs out of my arm, and I will prove to you I can go.’

The trip sparked an infection in his left leg, but it soon cleared up.

Pitcher had gotten up early and was lifting weights the June 2012 day he was due to receive his prosthetic leg when doctors delivered devastating news, he said.

He had another infection in his left leg, and it would require surgery.

‘That meant I had to wait another month, and that took depression to a whole new level,’ Pitcher said.

‘You are so tired of being in a wheelchair, so tired of being on crutches.’

The downward spiral caused him to suffer severe mood swings including ‘extreme anger,’ now-wife Michelle lamented.

Pitcher also started convincing friends to take him to nearby bars where he drank heavily. He also began downing dozens of powerful Oxycontin pills a day, as many as 40, he recalled.

The pills and drinking left him in a ‘zombie-like’ state, said Michelle Pitcher.

His prosthetic leg came in July 2012, he was walking on it within a week.

Three sessions per day in the gym helped him recover to the point he competed in the Army Ten-Miler, an annual race to the Pentagon.

Pitcher could not sprint, but strapped on a backpack with 50 pounds of weights and jogged the majority of the way, he recalled.

His determination led him to complete the Army Physical Fitness Test – 80 push-ups, 80 sit-up and a two-mile run – in only 14 minutes, 23 seconds.

Pitcher ranked in the top 10 per cent among all active-duty soldiers.

He was asked to join the U.S. Paralympics Team during a January 2013 snowboarding trip to Colorado.

‘No, I am staying in the Army,’ he replied.

Pitcher’s first test jump from a C-17 plane June 16 of last year caused him to worry if the prosthetic would hold up as he plunged back to land.

‘Keep your feet and knees together,’ he kept reminding himself – one of the first lessons taught to paratroopers.

‘He landed pitch-perfect,’ his proud father said, recalling the afternoon he spent in the landing zone. ‘At that point, he walked over and said, ‘Okay, I can do this.’

Pitcher was soon recommissioned into the prestigious 82nd Airborne Division. He was then redeployed to Afghanistan in November, and has led a platoon of 21 paratroopers into battle as if nothing ever happened to his foot - as if the prosthetic blade was never attached to his leg just below the knee.

He is one of only 57 amputee soldiers to return to combat, and only the second paratrooper.

Grueling combat duty does take its toll on Pitcher – he is not allowed to take Oxycontin anymore, the pain can sometime be excruciating.

‘You just have to accept it’s going to hurt and deal with it your own way,’ Pitcher told the paper from his post.

He then jokingly took a knife and held it at the end of his ‘blade’ – like a bayonet.

‘If we get attacked, I will just kick.’

But he has also promised to retire if he gets another purple heart – the medal awarded to soldiers injured in the line of duty.

For now, he is just another soldier prepping for his next mission.He returned.
