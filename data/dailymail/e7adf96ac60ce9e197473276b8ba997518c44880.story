The 'Great Firewall of China': The Chinese government has announced it is to work with search engines to protect Chinese citizens. China is the origin of many cyber attacks including several high-profile hacks of foreign government officials

The Chinese government is stepping up internet security for its own citizens this week after a series of leaks of personal data from social networking sites and 'phishing' attacks on bank accounts.

The government announced it would work with 10 Chinese search engines  - which already censor the internet under Chinese law - to ensure 'fake' banks appear lower in search rankings.

The move comes in the wake of several high-profile cyber attacks originating in China which targeted U.S and other government officials.

China is widely suspected of being 
the origin of many hacking attacks on government and commercial websites
abroad, but officials have repeatedly dismissed reports that the 
government or military could be behind such attacks.                   

Earlier this year, hackers based in Jinan, China targeted personal Gmail and Yahoo accounts of government officials.

The methods used suggested insider knowledge about the offiicals according to many observers.

The Chinese government denied any involvement.

'Blaming these misdeeds on China is unacceptable,' said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei after the attacks.

'Hacking is an international problem and China is also a victim. The claims of so-called support for hacking are completely unfounded.'

China bans numerous overseas 
websites, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and some foreign media
outlets, fearing the uncensored sharing of images and information could
cause social instability and harm national 
security.        

The Chinese Ministry of Public Security said on Friday it would work with 10 Chinese search engines to protect the website rankings of financial institutions to lessen the chances that Internet users will be duped by phishing websites.      

A phishing attack occurs when the user is persuaded to part with his or her username and password via a fake webpage that closely resembles the original.        

Through the collaboration, the official websites of several Chinese banks, such as Agricultural Bank of China and China Construction Bank will be ranked first in the search engine when a user searches for the related keywords, the Ministry said in an online circular on Friday.        

The move comes after a spate of personal data leaks that alarmed the online community and prompted calls for tougher scrutiny of who has access to online information.             

China claims the most Internet users in the world at 485 million, state media reported last month, and despite widespread censorship and monitoring online, many users have been up in arms about the reported data leaks and their implications.        

The user IDs, passwords and e-mail addresses of more than 6 million accounts registered on CSDN - a site for programmers - were leaked, Xinhua New Agency reported last week, citing an anti-virus software provider which discovered the problem.    

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that it would investigate the hacking incidents, 'The department believes the recent leak of user information is a serious infringement of the rights of Internet users and threatens Internet safety. The department strongly condemns such behaviour.'
