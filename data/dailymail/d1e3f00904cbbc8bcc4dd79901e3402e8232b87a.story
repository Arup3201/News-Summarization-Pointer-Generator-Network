Questions: Julie Bailey set up the Cure the NHS campaign after her mother Bella died at Mid Staffordshire

Half the cash paid to victims of the Mid Staffs hospital scandal has been pocketed by their lawyers, the Mail can reveal today.

One patient who suffered botched surgery was paid just £6,500 in compensation yet his solicitors picked up £221,000 – 34 times as much.

And, in another case of neglect at Stafford hospital, lawyers made almost £50,000 while the victim received only £15,000. 

Official figures show that 104 negligence claims have succeeded against the Mid Staffordshire NHS trust over the past four years.

But ‘ambulance chasing’ lawyers have picked up almost half of the £7.4million compensation paid out by taxpayers. Because the figures are incomplete the solicitors’ share may be higher still.

Hundreds of patients are feared to have died unnecessarily at Mid Staffordshire between 2005 to 2009, and earlier this year a damning report warned that many others had suffered appalling abuse.

The startling compensation figures have raised fresh concerns over the tactics employed by lawyers who tout for NHS negligence cases.

Using the controversial ‘no-win, no fee’ system, they entice the vulnerable with slick sales pitches on TV adverts.

If they win, they demand costs of up to £900 an hour, which they justify as their reward for taking a risk.

Last night Margaret Hodge, the Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, described the figures as shocking.

‘Lawyers provide an invaluable service in supporting people’s rights, but they should not be exploiting this in a way which is greedy and excessive,’ she said.

‘It takes a lot for somebody who has suffered negligence – or whose relatives have – at the hands of the health service to take action.

‘To then find that you have greedy lawyers exploiting you by making money on the back of it is unacceptable and extremely disgraceful.’

Bereaved relatives and victims of the Mid Staffs scandal have been frustrated at how long their legal cases have taken.

By the time some cases finished, the medical staff responsible for the blunders had retired or changed careers – sparing them any accountability.

Julie Bailey, who set up the Cure the NHS campaign after her mother Bella died at Mid Staffordshire, said: ‘If the NHS stopped harming patients then the solicitors wouldn’t be able to claim the money. 

‘The NHS has created this situation by harming patients and then making it so difficult to get answers.

'If you take legal action you just get a small settlement. You don’t learn any answers and the trust doesn’t learn any lessons.

'I have met people who have been in a legal battle with the NHS for 20 years and they still have no answers.’ 

Deb Hazeldine, whose 67-year-old mother Ellen Linstead died at Stafford Hospital, added: ‘The system is torture. It took me three years to get my complaint upheld. They treated my complaint with utter contempt. 

‘My mum died of something she caught in hospital. The responsibility is on the trust to be open and transparent.’

Lawyers say they expect to see an ‘explosion’ in medical negligence claims in future years, following the scandals at Mid Staffs and at Colchester Hospital University Foundation Trust this week.

Last year legal firms received £250million through claims against the NHS as a whole for medical negligence. 

During a 12-month period between 2011 and 2012, five practices received £35million between them.

A spokesman for Mid Staffordshire trust said the compensation payments were made by the NHS Litigation Authority, which acts as an insurance scheme for the hospital, and the majority were for ‘historical’ mistakes.

The spokesman added: ‘We never hush up mistakes. All serious incidents are reported to a board held in public every month. This does not reflect Stafford Hospital as it is today. The care of our patients has significantly improved.’
