A nine-year-old girl who was shot in the head after her father opened fire on her and her siblings 10 weeks ago is now walking and communicating in hospital.

Lauren Mohney has no memory of the incident but has asked about her brother and sister, who were both killed in the attack, lawyer Zachary Stoumbos told the Daytona Beach News-Journal.

She was the only survivor after her father, David Mohney, opened fire at their Port Orange, Florida home on October 17 as he went through a divorce with their mother. He killed Lauren's 14-year-old sister, Savanna, and 11-year-old brother, David Jr., before turning the gun on himself.

Investigators have  credited Savanna with saving Lauren's life, saying the teenager shielded her younger sister from their father's gunfire.

To answer Lauren's questions about her siblings, Stoumbos said that the family had been speaking to her about heaven.

'It's tough,' he said. 'We are easing into it. It's very delicate.'

Her mother, Cynthia Mohney, was not injured in the attack and has been at her daughter's bedside at the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando ever since. They plan to spend Christmas together in the hospital, Stoumbos said.

Lauren, who was placed in a medically-induced coma after being shot in the left side of her brain, woke up in mid-November and is now breathing on her own, walking, eating and talking, he said.

Photographs shared on Facebook show Lauren smiling in hospital and alongside her mother.

She is now facing months of speech and physical therapy, and friends of the family have raised more than $13,000 for her treatment on a gofundme page.  

Murdered: Lauren, left, survived after her older sister Savanna, second left, shielded her little sister with her body, lawyers believe. Savanna and their brother, David Jr., both died in the rampage

Killer: They were shot dead in their home by their father, David Mohney, who then took his own life

Deputies received a call at 5:11am on October 17 and the arriving deputies found the two girls in an upstairs bedroom and their brother in a bedroom on the first floor. 

Their father was in the kitchen with a handgun next to him and a self-inflicted gun wound. 

Stoumbus said he believes Savanna, who was found 'draped' over her sister, had acted as a blockade against her father's gunfire. 

'We believe Savanna was coming down the stairs because she suspected something bad had happened (to her brother),' he previously told the Journal Online. 'But then changed her mind and went to her younger sister's bedroom to protect her. 

'We believe that because she protected her little sister, Lauren's injuries were not as bad.'

On the morning of the murders, Mr Mohney, a retired Army sergeant, told his wife: 'If you don't come back to me and stop the divorce, I will kill our children,' Stoumbus said.

Strength-to-strength: Lauren, left with her mother, was shot on the left side of her brain and was put into a medically-induced coma. But she is now breathing, walking, talking and eating on her own

Improving: The young survivor will now need months of speech therapy and physical therapy

He then reportedly punched her in the mouth and added: 'If you're going to take my kids away, you will not have them and you will go through the rest of your life without children.'   

After showing her he had a gun, 'he continued to tell her, "You will be back with me," and, "This divorce was going to stop",' Stoumbos told WFTV. 

Cynthia ran to get help and, while she was at a neighbor's home, she heard shots fired. She ran back to the house and was found lying between her two daughter when authorities arrived.

'His hate took over his love for his children,' Stoumbos said. 'I can't imagine that level of evil, that level of hate.'

When he filed for divorce, David Mohney said little about problems with his wife, but indicated that he wanted to move back to Rapid City, South Dakota, while she did not. They had moved to Florida in 2010 so he could study at Palmer College of Chiropractic's campus in Port Orange.

He made more specific accusations when he asked a Volusia County court for a protective injunction on June 3. 

Victims: David Jr. and Savanna were killed as their parents went through a divorce and on the morning of the killings, he reportedly told his wife: 'If you take my kids away, you will not have them'

Scene: After his threats, Cynthia ran next door for help but heard gunshots inside their Port Orange home

He claimed that she had been drinking heavily and had slapped him and their children on their chests, backs and arms. Florida's child welfare agency said Cynthia had been treated for substance abuse.

However, he dismissed the request for protection two weeks after filing it.

Authorities have said that they are not looking into Mrs Mohney's conduct and that an investigation is still underway, including toxicology tests on David Mohney.  

His divorce lawyer Doug Kneller previously said his client was seeing a 'mental health professional', while Stoumbos said that he had been taking anti-depressants.
