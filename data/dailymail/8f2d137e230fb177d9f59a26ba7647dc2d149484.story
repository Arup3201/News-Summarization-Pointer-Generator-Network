Couple: Jennifer Korth, nee Hutcheson, died Monday. She married husband Allen Korth just weeks ago on July 6

Tragic: Korth learned she had esophageal cancer five years ago

Allen said in a statement to the newspaper 'My wife (I just love saying that) has affected my life in just about every way imaginable. ... So many people enter relationships thinking they have some kind of void to fill, and we weren't like that.

'We already felt complete as individuals, but as spending time together made life even more special, taking the road together felt as natural as the sunrise. Both of us are better for it.'

Maid of honor Alexis Cook told The Flint Journal 'I hope that [Jennifer] knows that she has made the world a better place [....] (She taught us) you should appreciate what you have every day.'

At the Korths' wedding last month, Jennifer wore a wig and spent most of the ceremony and reception in a wheelchair, the newspaper reported.

Photographs revealed the wedding's pink, black and white color scheme. The bride's bouquet included flowers in white and shades of pink. 

The big day: The Korths' wedding was arranged by group Wish Upon a Wedding, which aims to help couples in which one or both partners are terminally ill or face life-altering conditions

Allen was stunned with his mouth wide open when Jennifer gave him a guitar as a present, the newspaper said.

By the time the couple married, Jennifer was already in hospice care. They did not marry earlier because they feared losing her insurance, The Flint Journal reported.

Before her wedding, she told the paper 'When there's something you've always wanted and you're faced with death ... it kind of brings peace to you. There's something about changing your last name to the person you love. It's just important to me that I get to do that.'

'We played married already,' she also said.

Wish Upon a Wedding helped with the couple's wedding arrangements.
