Manchester City left themselves with only three senior strikers to defend their Barclays Premier League title after selling Alvaro Negredo to Valencia.

The Spanish club agreed a loan deal for the 29-year-old and confirmed they plan to trigger a £23.8m release clause in his City contract next summer.

Negredo, who cost City £20m when he arrived from Sevilla a year ago, began last season with 12 goals in his first 20 appearances but began to struggle and started only three Premier League games after January.

Done deal: Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo has signed a season-long loan with Valencia

His departure came as City also allowed Micah Richards to move on a season-long loan to Fiorentina.

It made it an entirely different transfer deadline day for City from six years ago, when the ‘noisy neighbours’ announced their arrival as major players in English football by breaking the British transfer record to sign Robinho on the new owner’s first day.

Monday night was more about the impact of financial fair play, with City pulling out of the bidding for Radamel Falcao and allowing him to go to Old Trafford while leaving themselves with only Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic up front.

Richards’ departure meant the last remaining outfield player from the pre-Abu Dhabi era has left. The defender, who signed for City as a 14-year-old in 2002 when the club had just won promotion to the Premier League, was frustrated by a lack of first team opportunities.

Fiorentina paid £3.5m to take him and will have to find another £4.7m if they want to make the move permanent next summer.

Although expected, his departure will sadden many City fans who saw the 26-year-old defender as a link to the club’s more modest roots before Sheik Mansour took over in 2008. Goalkeeper Joe Hart is the only survivor from before the takeover, having signed from Shrewsbury in 2006.

Richards never lived up to the promise that saw him win his England debut as a teenager and go on to earn 13 caps. And with City forced to reduce the size of their Champions League squad for breaking UEFA financial rules, manager Manuel Pellegrini had no hesitation in letting him leave. 

Richards flew to Italy to complete his move and was pictured smiling as he concluded negotiations to become the 24th English player to join a Serie A club.

A deal to send unwanted midfielder Scott Sinclair to Stoke fell through, as did efforts to find a club for defender Matija Nastasic.
