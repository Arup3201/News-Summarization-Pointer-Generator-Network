A former pro-football Hall of Famer who developed dementia in his twilight years died a painful and senseless death while in the care of an Atlanta, Georgia assisted-living facility.

George McAfee, a former running back for the Chicago Bears, drank industrial-strength detergent after wandering unsupervised into a cleaning room at the home run by the Emeritus Corporation.

The chemical burned his lips, esophagus and lungs before he died in terrible pain in hospital in 2009, he was aged 90.

When caregivers found McAfee, his lips were black and his face looked like a ‘horror show death mask,’ his daughter, Cheryl Morgan, 66, told ABCNews.

‘It was horrible, horrible,’ she said. ‘I cannot begin to tell you how horrific it was. We just hope he wasn't conscious.’

McAfee’s family sued Emeritus, one of the largest operators in the assisted living business, who accepted responsibility and the parties settled out of court.

The circumstances surrounding McAfee’s demise and other tragic deaths at assisted-living facilities are featured in a PBS Frontline documentary - ‘Life and Death in Assisted Living’ - which premiered on Tuesday night at 10 p.m. ET.

The program takes a critical look at the growing market for so-called ‘memory units’, which appeal to families looking for a home-like environment for their loved ones who are suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

The documentary focuses on Seattle-based Emeritus, whose advertising slogan is, ‘Our family is committed to yours.’

In the tragic case of McAfee, facility records reveal that no one was on duty for 30 minutes in the wing where he found the cleaning fluid.

His family said that when he moved to the care home initially he had regular caregivers who knew about his tendency to wander when he couldn’t sleep.

But they claim care at the facility went downhill after Emeritus took it over and began to rotate staff.

On the night that McAfee drank the bleach, he had opened a cabinet that was supposed to be locked.

A caregiver found McAfee ‘sitting on the bed coughing and spitting up on a Kleenex and on the floor,’ said Morgan.

When she arrived, his lips were ‘black and blue’ and he could hardly speak. He died 10 days later at age 90.

Granger Cobb, president and CEO of Emeritus, told ABCNews that the fact the cabinet wasn’t locked was ‘a failure on our part.’

‘George McAfee was an absolute tragic accident that was horrific and the community was devastated,’ he said.

‘We sincerely regret the pain and trauma they experienced. … There has never been a similar accident in 20 years since we were founded.’

McAfee’s career as a running back for the Chicago Bears during the 1940s was interrupted both by injury and World War II.
