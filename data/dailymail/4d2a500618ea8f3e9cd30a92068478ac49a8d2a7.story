They had a less than amicable break-up after he was accused of cheating on her.

But their past doesn't make Snooki's ex-boyfriend Emilio Masella's statement that he hopes she has a miscarriage any less shocking.

Masella, who split from Jersey Shore star Snooki in April 2010, made the horrifying admission to TMZ.com.

'I hope you have a miscarriage': Snooki's ex-boyfriend Emilio Masella made this shocking admission to TMZ.com

He told the website: 'I hope for her sake ... not to be rude or anything ... but I hope she has a miscarriage.'

Masella
 also said that he thinks it would be a good idea for Snooki's boyfriend
 Jionni LaValle to get a paternity test to confirm that he is in fact 
the father of the baby.

He said: 'I would def recommend her to get 
pregnancy test to see who the father is because Iâ€™m sure there are other
 subjects.'

Masella then added: 'Vinny could easily be the father.'

His comments came as People.com reports Snooki and Jionni are now engaged.

A source told the publication Jionni is the father and the couple are now planning on tying the knot.

However, fans of Jersey Shore will know Snooki and Vinny have always had a close relationship, and ended up sleeping together on several occasions in the last series of the show.

In last week's episode of the current series of the MTV show, Vinny was even seen telling viewers that he and Snooki are like the 'Ross and Rachel of Jersey Shore' after they enjoyed a flirty afternoon together.

While Snooki has yet to confirm whether or not she is pregnant, it is thought that she is around three months along with her first child.

Who's the daddy? Emilio also suggested that Snooki's Jersey Shore castmate Vinny might be the father of her baby, after their various hook-ups on the show

However, Masella added to TMZ.com that Snooki had always been flippant about the prospect of having a family.

He said: 'When I was with her, she said she wanted twins. She would always say "Letâ€™s have twins." '

Masella predicted that Snooki and Jionni will marry after the baby's birth, but that reality star Snooki would 'pull a Kim Kardashian' by 'having the baby and break up with him right after.'
