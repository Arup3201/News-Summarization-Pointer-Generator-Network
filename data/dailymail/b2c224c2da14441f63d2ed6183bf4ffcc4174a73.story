Lille coach Rene Girard has stuck the knife into Arsenal after their disappointing Champions League defeat to Monaco on Wednesday night.

Sticking up for French football, Girard responded to claims that Ligue 1 is lacking in quality by delivering a brilliant riposte.

'To those who say our league is s***,' he told journalists, 'it [Monaco's win over Arsenal] proves there's perhaps s*** elsewhere as well.'

Arsenal were stunned on Wednesday, when their hopes of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals were dealt a near-fatal blow by the French giants.

Geoffrey Kondogbia fired Monaco into the lead in the first half, before former Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov added insult to injury with the second.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain looked to have restored some pride for Arsenal in injury-time, before a two-goal lead was restored by Yannick Ferreira Carrasco.

It leaves Arsenal's chances of progressing in the Champions League hanging precariously in the balance. 

They will need to travel to Monaco on March 17 and score three times to be in with a hope of qualifying.
