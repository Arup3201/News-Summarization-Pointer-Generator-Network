In a good year, when the sun shines on the summer fete and the congregation digs deep, one parish church can hope to collect up to £40,000.

But as the Reverend and his flock rejoiced in the birth of Christ yesterday, they were also celebrating coming into almost three times that in one fell swoop.

A bin bag containing £100,000 was found on the doorstep of a former vicarage owned by the St Thomas with St Maurice Church in York in August.

Blessed gift: The Parish Church of St Thomas with St Maurice, in York, has been awarded £100,000 which was found outside one of its properties earlier this year

Four months later, a court has decided the sum should be given to the church, which plans to spend it on charitable causes.

The
 current occupier of the old vicarage building  found the bag on bin 
collection day and did the honest thing by immediately handing it into 
police. Officers launched an investigation into how the money came to be
 dumped there and whether the bank notes were linked to criminal 
activity.

However, after 
being unable to find any evidence of criminality, officers ruled that 
the cash couldn’t be claimed as proceeds of crime.

A
 hearing was held at York Magistrates’ Court  to decide what should 
happen to it and its ruling has been announced just in time for 
Christmas.

Eleanor Course, 
the church diocese spokesman, said there was no dispute over who should 
be awarded the funds and the person who found the cash didn’t contest 
the church receiving it. She added: ‘It was just a matter of waiting for
 the magistrates to decide.’ The award was officially made to the church
 council of St Thomas with St Maurice under section one of the 1897 
Police Property Act.

The 
Act gives the public a route by which they can seek the return of 
property and allows for the disposal of unclaimed property. Under the 
law, if the owner of the property can’t be established, the magistrates 
must decide what to do with it.

Christmas bonus: The money is two-and-a-half times the £40,000 that St Thomas with St Maurice Church usually raises in income each year

Miss Course confirmed that the church was chosen by the court because it owns the property where the bag was left.

Yesterday,
 the church’s vicar, the Rev Philip Moore, declined to comment on the 
good news and referred inquiries to the York diocese, which has promised
 to make sure the funds are used to benefit the local community.

Miss Course said detailed plans  have yet to be drawn up.

She
 said: ‘No decisions have been taken as to how the money will be spent. 
We don’t know if it will go on a single project or not but it will be 
used for the church’s work in the community. Clearly it’s great news for
 the church.’

Finders, keepers: After York police could find no criminal activity linked to the money, a court awarded it to the local church

And the local residents’ association has already begun discussing which local charities could benefit from the windfall.

Martin
 Crosby, chairman of The Groves association, said two worthy causes 
include York Arc Light Project, which provides accommodation and support
 for the homeless; and Door 84, a youth club which caters for eight to 
17-year-olds and also doubles as a broader community centre.

The church hosts children’s play groups and has a vibrant student membership as it is close to York St John University.

A
 spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: ‘An investigation was 
carried out to see if the money was linked to crime. No definite link to
 crime has been established and there is insufficient evidence for the 
money to be forfeited under the Proceeds of Crime Act.’

Earlier
 this year a woman who forgot she left a bag containing £5,000 cash in a
 church had it returned after six years. A parishioner found the bag on a
 peg at the church in Brixham, Devon, and handed it into police. It was 
then returned to owner Karen Griggs, 47.
