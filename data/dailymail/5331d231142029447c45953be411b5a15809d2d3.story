furious messages on social networking site Twitter after one of 
his restaurants was attacked by rioters.

restaurant, was targeted as hooligans rampaged through Birmingham's
 Bullring shopping centre last night.

Oliver made his comments as news 
emerged that one of Notting Hill's most upmarket restaurants was also 
pillaged by rioters who robbed terrified diners.

The celebrity chef tweeted: 'So sad to
 see what's happening in UK with these riots! All gone mad. time to get 
our country back. Now we need to come down hard on these idiots.'

He added later: 'Sadly my restaurant 
in Birmingham got smashed up, windows all gone, whole area closed, can't
 open, staff and customers all safe!! thankfully.'

A window was smashed in the 
restaurant, which is at the back of the Bullring Shopping Centre. However, the 
star's spokesman said it had managed to open for lunch

The 36-year-old said: 'My cookery 
school was in the thick of Clapham riot but seems they're not interested
 in reading or cooking as Waterstones & Resipease go left'.

Elsewhere, terrified diners at one of 
Notting Hill's most upmarket eateries were among those caught up in the 
riots terror after thugs burst into a restaurant and ripped wedding 
rings from the fingers of female customers.

The Ledbury in Notting Hill, a 
favourite dining spot of Kate Moss and Lily Allen, came under attack 
when 100 masked youths ransacked the restaurant before ripping jewellery
 and wallets from diners.

News of the attack on the Ledbury 
first came to light at 11pm last nightÂ  when Twitter user 
@harrywilkinson told how his parents' anniversary dinner had been 
interrupted by looters.

Yobs used furniture to smash their way
 into the Michelin-starred restaurant before causing 'chaos' as staff tried
 to usher customers upstairs to safety.

The attack had happened just 100m away
 from another celebrity-favoured restaurant, Bumpkin, which was also hit
 by looters in a 'whirlwind' attack.

Describing the ordeal at The Ledbury, 
Harry Wilkinson tweeted: 'Bunch of people smashed the windows in and 
came in and tried ripping watches and wallets jewellery off customers.'

His parents Maggie and Clive, who were celebrating their 29th wedding anniversary.

Mr Wilkinson told The Times: 'They had baseball bats, things like that. They were shouting at people "We want your money, your wallets, your watches, your phones." Everyone was screaming.

'Everything in the restaurant was being smashed. They turned tables over, it was mayhem.'

His wife hid under the table and hid her watch inside her bra.

Louise Yang, who was robbed of her wedding and engagement rings, told the paper: 'The restaurant staff were yelling at us to get away from the windows.

'Before I knew it, the front door, a solid piece of glass, shattered and people came crashing in with hoodie, masks and random weapons.'

The attack eventually finished when cooks stormed from the kitchen with knives and rolling pins.

Food blogger, Louise Yang, tweeted 
that it was her 'most expensive meal ever', as looters tore her 
engagement and wedding rings from her finger, and described how kitchen staff 
came to their rescue with kitchen utensils before ushering all the 
guests into the cellar.

Locals' favourite pub, the Walmer Castle, was also boarded up after being targeted by the rioters last night.

Oliver took to Twitter again to 
praise the clean up effort by Londoners, writing: 'God bless the 
communities getting together to sort this out. People who care about 
their country!!'
