Michael Gove has spent a week at an Austrian ‘fat farm’ to help him show off his Tory leadership credentials at this week’s party conference in Manchester.

The Education Secretary, tipped as an heir to David Cameron, padded around the £2,500-a-week spa in his bathrobe and fluffy slippers – and was the only man there.

Mr Gove, who ballooned to 15st after the Tories won power with the Lib Dems, has lost 2st since visiting the Mayr health resort, which is popular with celebrities including Liz Hurley and the Duchess of York.

The centre on the shores of Lake Worthersee is not for the fainthearted. Mr Gove was stripped of his two mobile phones and laptop, banned from drinking caffeine or alcohol, and restricted to consuming just 600 calories a day.

Treatments at the Mayr clinic include colonic irrigation and blood-letting. One female guest, who visited the spa at the same time as Mr Gove this summer, told The Mail on Sunday the Cabinet Minister was ‘pink-faced, chilled and smiley’.

‘He took advantage of many health and beauty treatments, and chatted to the women over fruit teas,’ she said. ‘Supper was soup and stale bread – stale because it makes you chew it a lot – while the first thing we had to do every morning was drink Epsom salts and magnesium citrate to clear out the system.

‘Breakfast was sheep’s yogurt and a piece of avocado. The hunger gave us terrible headaches.

One woman said to Mr Gove, “It’s grim, isn’t it?” and he replied, “It’s worth it. Politics takes it out of you, and conference season’s coming up – this is a good way to recharge the batteries.” ’

The fellow guest admitted that  she felt ‘utterly dreadful’ for a couple of days, but then ‘woke up and felt wonderful’.

Friends noted how much trimmer Mr Gove looked on BBC 1’s Question Time on Thursday.

However, sticking to his diet will be tricky at conference as he attends a gut-busting number of dinners and drinks receptions.

The disclosure that he has been  to a fat farm will fuel rumours that he is shaping up to make a leadership challenge when Mr Cameron eventually steps down as Prime Minister.

Mr Gove  has dismissed the speculation, saying he is ‘too ugly’.

He claimed ugly people have to spend more on their appearance than beautiful people to avoid descending ‘into the realms of the godawful’.

Mr Gove’s wife, the writer Sarah Vine, dropped a hint about the trip last week.

In her Daily Mail column she said that he had just returned from Austria ‘with a pair of swimming trunks in the style  of lederhosen’.

The detox regime should ensure he now slips into them with more ease.
