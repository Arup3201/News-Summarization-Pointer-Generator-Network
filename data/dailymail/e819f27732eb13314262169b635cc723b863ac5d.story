Sir Richard Branson has waded into the row over term-time holidays in a blog post entitled ‘Let children travel the world’.

In the post, the Virgin Atlantic boss says he ‘wholeheartedly’ supports parent Janice Skelcher who is campaigning for a judicial review of recent legislation that tightened the rules on term-time trips.

Mrs Skelcher, 39, and her husband were prosecuted for taking their two children out of school to travel to Australia for three weeks in October last year.

'Grab it with both hands': Sir Richard Branson said travel was important for children and argued that parents should not be punished for taking a holiday during term-time if that was the only time they could afford it

Sir Richard wrote: ‘It is really important that kids spend as much time travelling and learning as possible, from a young age.

‘Travel is not always an option for everyone; for those who are fortunate enough to be able to travel, they should grab it with both hands.

‘If there is no other time when parents can afford - financially or time-wise - to take a holiday, they should not be punished for doing so during term.’

Referring to the fact that Mrs Skelcher had been ordered to pay £400 legal costs for removing her children from school without permission, he wrote: ‘Her circumstances - at the time she was caring for her mother who was terminally ill – were not taken into account.

'She argued that taking her children on holiday with her husband was necessary to give everyone a break and protect the mental health of her kids.

‘While it is obviously important that all children should have access to regular education, there is no reason why they cannot catch up when they return, and do extra work out of class.’

Mr Branson, who left school aged 16, said that increasing the flexibility for young people’s learning could only be a good thing and said he echoed Mrs Skelcher’s call for the government to give parents more support and greater flexibility.

He wrote: ‘Letting children travel provides the opportunity for families to spend quality time with each other, something I have always found invaluable with my own family. Some of my happiest memories are of childhood holidays – some during term-time, some not.’

In her petition, Mrs Skelcher is 
demanding a judicial review of the new regulations, and asks MPs ‘to 
recommend that greater support and flexibility [are] allowed for parents
 to enable them to more effectively care for their children’.

She
 claimed that her family’s three-week trip had to be during term time as
 she is a full-time carer for her dying mother-in-law and that was the 
only time alternative care could be arranged.

She
 was prosecuted by Coventry City Council for taking her children out of 
school and ordered to pay a £240 fine, which she refused on principle.

The court imposed a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered Mrs Skelcher to pay £400 costs.

When
 Mrs Skelcher was invited on a daytime TV show to discuss the case, the 
council obtained an injunction preventing identification of the children
 - in effect silencing her.

Now
 Mrs Skelcher has defied the gag and can be named under parliamentary 
privilege after Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming provided details of the
 case in a petition laid before the House of Commons.

Mrs Skelcher, a former emergency call handler, said: ‘I am very angry because now I have a criminal record.

‘My
 family circumstances mean that I had no choice but to take the children
 away when I did – and there are many parents in the same position who 
cannot take their children away in a period specified by school.

‘Any mother in my situation would do the same. I have not had one negative comment from the mums at the school gates.

‘The
 law states that there have to be exceptional circumstances. Well, if it
 is not caring for a terminally ill person with two primary school 
children, then what is?’

Australia trip: Mrs Skelcher says the three-week trip had to be during term time as she is a full-time carer for her dying mother-in-law and that was the only time alternative care could be arranged

Coventry
 council said it followed Department for Education guidance. It claimed:
 ‘On this occasion the parents decided not to accept the penalty notice,
 but the court’s verdict demonstrates that the council’s course of 
action was correct.’

In 
September, new legislation came into force ending a policy that allowed 
schools to grant up to 10 days leave for family holidays and introducing bigger fines for parents who take their children out of school.

Under the new rules, parents face fines of up to £120 for taking children out of school during term time without good reason.

Failing
 to pay risks a fine of up to £1,500 - or even jail - and pupils can only miss lessons in 'exceptional 
circumstances', such as a family funeral.

The Government recently published a Bill that would allow schools to set their own term dates.

The
 intention is to stagger holidays and drive down high summer prices that
 prompt some parents to take their children out of school.
