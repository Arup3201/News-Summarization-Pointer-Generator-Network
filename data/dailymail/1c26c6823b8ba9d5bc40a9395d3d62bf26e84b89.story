A man who lost his late father's treasured First World War medal on a beach when he was a child has been reunited with it - 76 years later.

Ben Eggleston was a five-year-old boy when he lost the 1914 Star, known as the Mons Star, while on a day trip to Brighton in August 1938.

He carried the medal in memory of his father who had died that year from lung cancer - a condition he developed after being gassed in the trenches.

He spent decades visiting archives, antique fairs and private collections trying to find the medal, which was awarded for bravery in the Battle of the Somme.

This month, Mr Eggleston, now 82, spotted the medal, inscribed with his father's name, Sergeant Stephen Eggleston, on an eBay auction. It is now at his home in Norfolk.

The former engineer said it was 'incredibly poignant' that he should find it in the centenary of the start of the war.

The great-grandfather said: 'After all these years of wondering what had happened to it, we just sat there in amazement looking at the screen, hardly daring to believe what we were seeing.'

He added: 'I am delighted it is now back with our family.

'It serves as an emblem of my father's heroism, and of the many hundreds of thousands of men who lost their lives or were injured in this terrible conflict.'

What happened to the medal, known as the Mons Star, after 1939 remains a mystery, though it was in the possession of its most recent owner for more than 30 years.

It will now join Sgt Eggleston's Meritorious Service Medal and his Military Medal, which were both awarded for bravery during the first day of the Battle of the Somme. He had been a private in the 4th Battalion Middlesex Regiment. 

Mr Eggleston, who visited the battlefields of France and Belgium researching his father’s military history, visited numerous archives, antique fairs, and medal collections in search of the medal.

More recently, Ben spent hundreds of hours on the internet almost daily in an attempt to find the lost medal. 

And every time his family visited Brighton they looked on the beach in the faint hope the medal had washed up.

His daughter Jane Bulmer, 55, said: 'Last week, he couldn’t believe his eyes when an eBay lot suddenly popped up on screen showing a Mons Star inscribed with his father’s name, regiment, and service number.

'It was part of a five-day auction by a Lincolnshire collector, who had owned the Mons Star for more than 30 years and had now decided to sell it.

'The seller had bought it himself from another collector, whose name was long forgotten, and there was no record of what had happened to the medal in the intervening 40 years before he had acquired it.

'This didn’t matter to my father as the important thing was that the Star had not been lost.'
