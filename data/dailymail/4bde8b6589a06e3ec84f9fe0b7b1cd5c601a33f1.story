Most politicians have been known to kiss a baby on the campaign trail.

But it seems today Alex Salmond has been ready to pucker up for just about anyone.

As the First Minister embarked on his final full day of campaigning ahead of tomorrow's referendum, he seemed ready to plant a smacker on almost anyone's cheek, whether they said Yes or No.

During a tour of  Hyspec Egineering in Stewarton near Glasgow, Mr Salmond also kissed Anne Lorne Gillies - the Scottish Gaelic singer who has used her public profile to back devolution

Both sides in the campaign have stepped up their efforts to win over undecided voters, with as many as 500,000 people still said to have yet to make up their minds

Polls continue to suggest that the referendum contest is going down to the wire, with three separate surveys last night all putting support for No narrowly ahead on 52 per cent, with 48 per cent for Yes.

There was new evidence today that the undecided voters, thought to be as many as 500,000 people, could be more inclined to vote No.

But Mr Salmond today insisted he was confident voters would back independence when they go to the polls from 7am tomorrow. 

In an attempt to win over voters he embarked on a fresh charm offensive, posing for selfies and showering wellwishers with kisses during a walkabout in East Kilbride shopping centre today. 

And on a visit to Hyspec Engineering in Kilmarnock, he took the chance to kiss Scottish Gaelic singer Anne Lorne Gillies. 

He also travelled to Largs in Ayshire during his final campaign push, hailing Scotland's 'date with destiny'. 

Kissing the First Minister seemed to be the only thing people in Largs wanted to do on Wednesday afternoon

In the sunshine of Largs, Ayshire, it seemed supporters were queuing up to meet the First Minister, give him a hug and get a kiss

Mr Salmond has joked about the number of selfies he has taken during the campaign, as voters rush to record the historic referendum

Anyone with a camera wanted their own photo with Mr Salmond as he toured Largs during his final campaign push

Throughout the referendum campaign, Mr Salmond has been repeatdly asked to pose for selfies, as he was today with a voter outside the British Heart Foundation charity shop in the East Kilbride shopping centre

Mr Salmond also smiled for the smartphone cameras at Hyspec Egineering as the latest polls suggested the result is too close to call

On his final campaign push, Mr Salmond also visited the headquarters of Braehead Foods in Kilmarnock

Travelling around Scotland in a helicopter, Mr Salmond gave onlookers a thumbs up as he predicted his campaign for independence would win

Speaking on a visit to an engineering firm in Stewarton, Ayrshire, the SNP leader said: 'My confidence is based on what's happening in the streets and communities around Scotland.

'I think there's a very substantial movement towards yes because people understand this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to take the future of this country into our hands.

'When people go into the polling booths tomorrow they are going to vote for something, for a that vision of more prosperous but also a more just society, that's what's going to motivate people in the polling stations tomorrow.'

Mr Salmond added: 'I think the movement is to Yes. I'm certain of that actually. I think we're being helped enormously by two things. 

'One is the total negativity of the No campaign, it's a dismal, depressing no campaign. 

'But also the positive message of Yes. We see in the employment figures today, a 45,000 increase in Scottish jobs, soaring beyond the UK level, Scottish unemployment well down, that's fantastic news for Scotland.' 

Thousands of Yes supporters tonight gathered in George Square, Glasgow as a show of support for independence

The gathering came as a new poll put Yes on 49 per cent and No on 51 per cent, suggesting the result is simply too close to call

Mr Salmond urged voters to ignore the 'arguments of politicians and the blizzard of statistics' and instead embrace the chance to put 'Scotland's future in Scotland's hands'

There have been growing fears about intimidation from the Yes campaign, but today's event appeared to pass off peacefully

But in a barnstorming speech today, Gordon Brown tore into Mr Salmond, insisting Scotland does not belong to him or any other politician, declaring: 'Scotland belongs to all of us.'

Speaking without notes, he urged anyone with doubts about the risks of separation to vote No to save the Union, adding: 'What we created together, let no nationalist split asunder.'

The speech could become seen as one of the defining moments of the campaign, and reignite questions about whether Mr Brown should have fronted the No campaign from the start.
