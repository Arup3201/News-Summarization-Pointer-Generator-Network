The days of memorising long passwords and answering tedious security questions when calling your bank could soon be over.

Barclays is unveiling a voice recognition system that it claims will slash the time it takes to access your account from 90 seconds to just ten.

The ‘foolproof’ software works by taking a recording of a customer’s voice when they sign up, which is then stored in a secure database.

Hi-tech: The software will slash the time it takes to gain access to your account information from 90 seconds to just ten. The bank said that customers often have trouble remembering passwords or long account numbers

When the customer next calls the bank,
 their unique speech patterns are compared against the initial 
recording. If the voice sample matches the original, Barclays call 
centre staff will get a notification verifying the caller’s identity.

According
 to experts at UK telecoms firm Kcom ‘even the best impressionists’ such
 as Rory Bremner or Alistair McGowan are unable to fool modern speech 
recognition software.

This is because the technology is so sophisticated
 it can pick up imperceptible quirks in how someone breathes or the 
speed at which they say certain words.

Barclays head of personal and corporate banking Ashok Vaswani said the technology was ‘foolproof’.

The
 bank believes the software is so reliable it can render obsolete the 
arduous string of passwords and security questions that leave many 
customers frustrated.

The 
existing security process requires customers to read out a 16-digit 
debit card number or a shorter telephone banking passcode.

Some
 customers are also asked for their account number and sort code, as 
well as their mother’s maiden name or their date of birth. Call centre 
staff sometimes also ask for details of a regular direct debit.

Barclays said this drawn-out process can last for a minute-and-a-half, and customers often have trouble remembering passwords.

Its
 voice recognition system, designed by Nuance Communications, is said to
 be able to reduce such security hurdles to just ten seconds, according 
to Barclays.

The bank 
already offers the service in its Barclays Wealth division – for more 
affluent customers with at least £500,000 to invest – resulting in a 60 
per cent fall in customer complaints.

It will extend it to business 
customers by the end of this year, followed by its 12million retail 
customers in 2015.

‘We know that having to answer security questions can
 be an inconvenience and an irritant,’ a bank spokesman said.

The bank 
said it was not aware of any of its rivals in the UK offering a similar 
option.

Customers will also 
be able to opt out of the voice recognition system and stick with the 
existing security process, the bank said. It also promised that no voice
 recordings will be taken without permission.

Banks
 have long struggled with the trade-off between convenience for 
customers and the need to prevent fraud and identity theft.

Customers
 complained in 2011 when HSBC introduced a ‘secure key’ gadget, designed
 to prevent online banking fraud. Some complained about the ‘hassle’ of 
setting up the gadget, similar to a calculator, while others said it 
stopped working after one or two times.
