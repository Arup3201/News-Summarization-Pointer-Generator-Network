They were the underground military bases where MPs and the RAF prepared for what might have been during the Cold War.

Now the Drakelow Tunnels, a 265,000 square foot complex encompassing nuclear bunkers used in the Cold War, can be seen by a wider public audience after they were unveiled during a rare open day.

The bunkers near Kidderminster, Worcestershire, were constructed during World War Two originally for use by Rover under the Ministry of Aircraft Production’s Shadow Factory Scheme.

Eerie: The now empty tunnels were formerly occupied by MPs, military officials and the RAF until the Cold War ended in the early 1990s

Hideout: The tunnels were originally built for machine workshops in World War Two, but became strategy bunkers as tensions grew in the Cold War

War rooms: The kitchen of the canteen in the tunnels, which underwent a £1m renovation in the late 1980s

Code named MACADAM, the tunnels were originally built to Rover could use them to produce aero engines and components.

Although mainly used for machine workshops and storage, the secretive facility was given a second lease of life during the Cold War when officials took it over fearing a nuclear attack.

New rooms, equipment, water and other utilities were installed inside the tunnels as it became a base for the Regional Seat of Government.

Working ladies toilets were another feature of the Cold War bunker shown to the 60 visitors during the Open Day

Water works: A hot water dispenser in the bunker still has the same shine it did several decades ago

Preserved: A Trust of local people in Worcestershire helped save the bunker from redevelopment after it was sold in 1993

During the Cold War itself, MPs, army officials, the RAF and local police were among those who would use the underground complex to run exercises in case Britain was attacked.

In the late 1980s the government extensively renovated the bunkers at a cost of around £1,000,000, but as the Cold War ended in the early 1990s the site was eventually sold off.

Once the site was privately sold, plans emerged to turn it into a residential and commercial park.

However, the facility was saved after residents formed the Drakelow Preservation Trust and helped fight its redevelopment.
