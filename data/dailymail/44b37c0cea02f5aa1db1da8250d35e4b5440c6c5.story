A mother-of-two whose children suffered cruel taunts from their friends about her size has lost 5st in less than a year to beat the bullies. 

Emma Thair-White's weight tipped the scales at 15st after she began binge-eating and drinking a bottle of rosé wine a night to ease the pain of the death of her mother Ethel.

Emma, 43, from Grays, Essex  was a dress size 22, leaving her with low self-esteem and she would avoid going to the shops for new clothes because she was so ashamed of her body.

Emma Thair-White decided to undergo a dramatic change of lifestyle after her children were taunted for having a 'fat mum', pictured left, and she lost 5st in less than year, pictured right

Emma's weight had yo-yoed for 25 years after she first piled on the pounds as an 18-year-old and became even heavier after having both her children, Eva, 16, and Max, 10.

She admits that her unhealthy habits escalated after her mother passed away.

'I completely lost the plot when my mother died,' she said. 'I just ate and ate and was drinking far too much alcohol - around a bottle of a night. I only found out later that it is the sweetest and most calorific wine.

'I didn't care what I ate and if I fancied treating myself, I would. My favourite was Ben & Jerry's ice cream. I could easily eat a whole tub on my own in one go.

Emma's weight had always fluctuated but after having children she reached a size 22

'I had no self-esteem and didn't care about what I looked like. My weight had yo-yoed before, especially after having my children, but this time I didn't try to lose the weight again and I went up to a size 22. 

'I was so ashamed of my body that I took the pictures you can see today of me at my biggest. I thought this would give me the inspiration to lose lots of weight.' 

The final straw for the shop worker was when one of her children told her she had been described as their 'fat mum'. 

At the beginning of her weight loss journey Emma took before pictures, right before dieting, to spur her on. She lost 5st in less than one year, right, after her children were bullied about her size

It was at that point that Emma, who is married to husband Shayne, decided to make a dramatic change. She began exercising regularly, cut out the booze and completely changed her diet - eating low-fat meals and nutrition bars.

And she celebrated her new physique with a £6,000 breast enhancement operation.

Emma knuckled down and began exercising regularly by walking her dog Morris, a Hungarian Vizsla. But after several months of hard work she had only lost a stone. 

She realised she need some extra help to really kick start her weight loss so she started taking a Forza weight loss supplement and soon saw an improvement.

She took two Raspberry K2 supplements in the morning and then one at lunch - and the weight gradually began to shift. 

Emma lost staggering 4st in five months. She says that although diet supplements often have a bad reputation she had found them very effective.

'Diet pills aren't for everyone but they definitely worked for me,' she said. 'I don't put anything in my body without checking very carefully first and a doctor I trust said I was fine to take them.'

Emma lost 70lb in a year - almost 1.5lb a week - going down to just 10st and a shapely size 12.

'I lost a stone a month after I started taking them and quickly got down to my ideal weight.'  

Emma lost a total of 124cm of fat from her legs, arms, waist and chest. But found that her weight loss caused her breasts to shrink, going down from a 36E to a 34C.

In order to regain some of her shapely cleavage Emma celebrated her weight loss by having a £6,000 breast uplift and implants - and she loves her new 34F bust. 

'As the weight fell off me my boobs just went. I had always been proud of my figure but I couldn't bear to look at myself in the mirror.

'I have always put my children first throughout all my life. My husband Shayne said to me, "Just for once we are going to put you first". 

'I am so pleased with my new boobs. They look amazing.'  

Emma plans to keep her healthy new lifestyle going into 2015 and has promised her children that she won't put the weight back on.

'I want them to be proud of their mum. I have worked so hard to get where I am now. I am not going to let all that good work go to waste.'
