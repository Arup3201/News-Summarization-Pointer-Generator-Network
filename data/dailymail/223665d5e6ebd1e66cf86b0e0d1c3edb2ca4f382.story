Kevin Brown, 56, is an Exeter City supporter, who works in the airfreight industry.

He also follows the fortunes of his local team Ashford Town (Middx) and West Ham the  and Celtic.

He said: 'On Sunday I saw that I was fourth  so I thought I might as well try for the weekly prize.

'I used nine of my transfers bringing in mainly Liverpool and Man City players, leaving me seven for the final game on Monday night.

'I  used the final seven transfers once the team news was in.

'I picked James Chester along with some other Hull defenders as they looked to have a nice early run of games  and were reasonably priced allowing me to have more to spend on midfielders and strikers.' 

Think you can be a Grand Master like Kevin?

The first MailOnline Fantasy Football Grand Master of the season can be revealed - Kevin Brown from Ashford in Middlesex. 

The manager of To Hull and Back scoops the £1,000 weekly prize after a crafty opening week performance which saw him earn a whopping 231 Fantasy Football points, but - and it's a big BUT - use all 16 of his transfers.

Mr Brown, who explains his remarkable transfer strategy (see panel, right) and is detailed in the graphic (second below), will now have to wait until the January transfer window before he can replenish his side.

His selection of Hull City trio goalkeeper Alan McGregor and defenders Alex Bruce and James Chester was inspired and key to his prize-winning score.

Centre-half Chester, who scored in the FA Cup final against Arsenal last season, registered an impressive 19 points for those fantasy managers who selected him. 

Bruce earned six points and McGregor 14 as Hull beat newly-promoted QPR 1-0 at the KC Stadium.

Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson was also a hugely successful pick with an opening-day score of 16 points.

Check out Mr Brown's winning team (below) and remember, it's not too late for you to enter a team and go for the £1,000 weekly prize. 

All you have to do is be the top manager on one of the 38 Premier League game weeks to be crowned a Grand Master. Cumulative points over the season do not count towards the weekly prize.

There's £60,000 in total in this season's prize fund, which includes a £10,000 top prize for the overall best manager. There's also a £5,000 special prize for the chairman who manages the top-performing mini-league.

It's all to play for and it's completely FREE to enter. So, what are you waiting for?
