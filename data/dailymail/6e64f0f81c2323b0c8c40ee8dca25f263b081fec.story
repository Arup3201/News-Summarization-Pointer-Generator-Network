Twisted ISIS supporters are distributing a sickening video game that allows users to play the role of Islamic extremists on a mission to murder Westerners.

Supporters of the terror group, which has brought rape and massacre to vast swathes of Syria and Iraq, have modified the popular video game ARMA III to create characters based on ISIS militants.

The user-generated modification, or 'mod' in video game parlance, is understood to reward users for killing Westerners and characters based on Syrian regime soldiers and the brave Kurdish peshmerga fighters who have formed the most effective resistance against the terrorists in real life.

Although the mod is  not part of an official release by Czech developers Bohemia Interactive, ISIS supporters are said to be using it to recruit children and radicalise the vulnerable, distributing it free on gaming forums to those declaring their support for the terror group's self-styled caliphate.

Shocking: Supporters of the terror group, which has brought rape and massacre to vast swathes of Syria and Iraq, have modified the popular video game ARMA III to create characters based on ISIS militants

The modification actually started as an anti-ISIS update according to Vocativ, with video game players creating characters to fight against who were based on the Islamist militants.

However ISIS supporters quickly 'hijacked' the mod and enabled users to play as the jihadis themselves, encouraging them to murder characters based on Westerners and anti-ISIS troops.

According to the website, one ISIS supporter took to a well known pro-terror web forum to promote the mod, posting: 'In the latest version of the game ARMA III there are mods in which a user can play as an ISIS militant, especially against the Peshmerga and Syrian army.'

A second anonymous supporter replied: 'I will, with the help of Allah, make dozens of copies for this game and distribute it for free to all the brothers that use the name of the Islamic Caliphate.'

It is not the first time ISIS has hijacked Western video games to spread propaganda, having previously used Grand Theft Auto 5 to recruit children and radicalise the vulnerable.

Chilling: ISIS' black flag of jihad is seen painted on cars and flying on flag poles in the video game mod

Hijacking the ARMA III modification is just the latest attempt by ISIS supporters to use the growing influence of video games to recruit children to their twisted cause and radicalise the vulnerable.

Last September ISIS uploaded a video to YouTube that carried the group's chilling black jihadi flag and showed violent scenes from the game - including police officers being gunned down and lorries being blown up by suicide bombers.

At the start of the video a message appears that reads: 'Your games which are producing from you, we do the same actions in the battelfields (sic)!!'. As the video continues, the players can be heard chanting Islamist slogans whenever a bomb explodes or another character is killed.

Pro-jihadi music is also heard playing throughout the video, which is designed to look and sound like the terror group's real-life footage of brutal slaughter that it has filmed in Syria and Iraq.

Egyptian media said that the video is meant to 'raise the morale of the Mujahideen, and the training of children and young teenagers to fight the West, and throw terror into the hearts of opponents of the state', according to Forbes.

ISIS has also made continual references to the hugely popular Call of Duty, producing slick posters that adopt the video games title to refer to jihad.

They have even produced slick propaganda films that ape Call of Duty's gameplay, using HD helmet cameras, freeze frame footage and heavily edited audio to make the terrorists' real-life murder and massacre in the Syrian city of Kobane look like little more than a video game.

A man has  been blindfolded and thrown off a tower block in Syria for 'being gay' before being stoned to death after surviving the fall.

New images emerged appearing to show ISIS militants hurling the man off the seven-storey building in the town of Tal Abyad.

The man, who was supposedly being punished for having a 'homosexual affair', apparently survived the fall, but was stoned to death by a waiting crowd at the foot of the tower block.

Footage shows the man sat on a plastic chair, while blindfolded, before being thrown off the tower block

The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists on the ground, claims the man was thrown from the building before being beaten to death.

Photographs of the incident appear to show the man - who is thought to be in his 50s - sat on a white, plastic chair while blindfolded.

He is surrounded by at least two masked militants, who are dressed in black clothing and army fatigues.

The man is then thrown from the top of the tower block and one photograph shows him falling towards the ground, head first.

The man was hurled from the building, at least seven storeys high, as punishment for 'being gay'

The crowd appeared to surround the man before beating him with stones until he fell unconscious
