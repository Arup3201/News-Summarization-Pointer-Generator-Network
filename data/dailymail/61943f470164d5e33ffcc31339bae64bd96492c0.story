You've heard of the selfie, the belfie and perhaps even the healthie.

But now those in the agricultural world have jumped on the self-portrait craze - snapping themselves with their livestock in so-called felfies.

But rather than embracing the opportunity to become the next Kim Kardashian or Kelly Brook, many of the animals look highly unimpressed at being dragged into the portraits.

Reluctant: Linda Costello's sheep dog looks less than impressed to be part of the so-called 'felfie'

Startled: Aisling Molloy from Tullamore, Offaly with her calf Jimmy

One in the series shows a rather startled white calfÂ  - called Jimmy - posing with its young owner Aisling Molloy from Tullamore, Offaly.

Another, Tom Lally from Galway, looks particularly happy his cows are enjoying their dinner in the background of the shot.

Meanwhile, one man obviously hasn't told his goat which way to look - as the animal stares off into the 
distance rather than down the lens.

Peter Desmond from Ballinhassig captioned the amusing picture 'Two Fine Beards'.

Linda Costello - who called her image 'Sheep Dogs must not blink' - appears to be almost strangling her sheep dog in her felfie. Either that or the animal has a lot of posing practise to catch up on...

Christine Warburton from Westmeath can be seen pulling her very best pout, while a white cow stands rather awkwardly in the background.

Not all the animals are uncomfortable in front of the camera, however.

In one of the images posted by Patrick and Helen Fleming from Bweeng Mallow, several cows can be seen desperately reaching to get their heads into the shot of their two owners.

All of the images were submitted to the Irish Farmer's Journal 'Selfie on the Farm' competition.

A panel of judges selected the ten best images to be entered into the final and, as well as the prestigious title, the winner was awarded a hamper.

Farmer P.J. Ryan, who is pictured 
standing with a herd of sellers while doing a thumbs up, smoking a pipe, took the top prize. His image gained 2,000 likes on Facebook.

Posting the image, his daughter Aisling Ryan said: 'Dad was helping my younger sister with her agricultural science project when he took the picture with his salers in the background.

'Dad buys the Irish Farmers Journal religiously every week and it would be amazing if you could publish his picture. I know he would be over the moon to see himself in the Journal.'

The competition has caused a storm on the internet.

A Facebook group for the images attracted 20,000 likes and several US sites have picked up on the fun pictures.
