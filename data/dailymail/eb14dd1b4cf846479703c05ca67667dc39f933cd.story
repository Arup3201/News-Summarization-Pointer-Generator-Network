A Connecticut baby has arrived with a splash, right into a toilet bowl.

The baby's father, David Davis, said he was forced to deliver the newborn in the bathroom of his West Haven home Friday morning after his wife, Lillie, went into labor.

He said the baby slipped through his hands during the delivery, but luckily went into the water.

When she began crying, he said it was the best sound he'd ever heard.

David said the couple had gone to Griffin Hospital in Derby earlier in that morning.

But a nurse evaluated Lillie and she was sent home after it was determined his wife was not ready to give birth.

However, Lillie began feeling strong labor pains a few hours later.

At that point David called 911.

'Once I got off the phone with them, she said she ... felt the need to push,' David Davis told NBC Connecticut.

So he did what he could to deliver the baby in the bathroom.

'And thank God we were near the toilet because she slid...the baby slipped through my hands and actually went into the water... crying like that,' he said.

Thankful: On his Facebook page, David expressed his thanks that what could have been a dangerous situation had a happy ending

Livia weighed in at 7 pounds, 6 ounces — soaking wet.

On his Facebook page, David expressed his thanks that what could have been a dangerous situation had a happy ending.

'God blessed us to be able to deliver her by ourselves in our new home,' he wrote. 'Hospital sent us home prematurely and our baby had a different schedule than ours.'

He also praised his wife's bravery.

'My wife is incredible and amazing to be able to do that,' he wrote on Facebook.

'I am in awe of her! I'm on top of the world to have been able to successfully deliver my own baby and be the first to hold her. Words can't express. Our house is now a home.'
