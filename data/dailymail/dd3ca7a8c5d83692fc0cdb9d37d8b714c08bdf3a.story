A bizarre feud between two families over who owned a £50,000 horse turned violent when three women were attacked with a whip in their own stables, a court heard.

Dorothy Rugg-Easey, 71, and her former stablehand Gemma Beavis, 36, had been rowing over valuable pure-bred mare Stella for over a year.

Yard owner Ms Rugg-Easey said she loaned breeding horse Stella to Ms Beavis but agreed the valuable horse would be kept on her property and Beavis would visit to ride her.

But in August last year Stella, a Morgan breed, disappeared from Ms Rugg-Easey’s farm and turned up at another local stables.

Ms Beavis claimed Ms Rugg-Easey had agreed to let the horse be moved elsewhere but Ms Rugg-Easey accused her of taking the animal without permission.

Ms Rugg-Easey’s family called police asking for help and begged Ms Beavis to return the horse, but to no avail.

Eventually fed-up Ms Rugg-Easey and her family hatched a late-night plan to get her prized horse back by lifting the gate at the stables of its hinges and walking the horse home.

But the feud came to a head when Ms Beavis’s close family friend John Thompson, 58, broke into Ms Rugg-Easey’s stables in Blean, Kent, in the early hours of August 11 this year.

Prized possession: The pure bred horse called Stella was worth £50,000

Canterbury Magistrates’ Court heard 
Thompson beat Ms Rugg-Easey, her daughter Liz, 43, and granddaughter 
Jess, 17, with a three-foot horse whip.

The
drunken attack only came to an end when Jess’s fiance Josh Mapp, 20, 
ran in shouting ‘you don’t hit women’ and tied Thompson up with a rope.

Thompson avoided jail on Monday when he was handed a suspended sentence at Canterbury Magistrates’ Court after admitting three counts of assault by beating.

He was jailed for 160 days, but the sentence was suspended for two years. He was also ordered to do 150 hours' unpaid work and must pay £250 compensation and £85 costs.

Ms Beavis denies any involvement or knowledge of Thompson's actions.

But incredibly, both families now claim they have had the steed stolen from their stables by the other family.

They are due to have another showdown in the courts after Ms Beavis lodged a private claim for the animal against Ms Rugg-Easey.

Ms Beavis, a mother-of-four who works
as a cleaner, said: 'I kept Stella at Dorothy’s stables for a while 
before asking if I could move her to another stables half a mile down 
the road. Dorothy said yes.

'Then I started getting solicitors’ 
letters saying I had to bring Stella back. She claimed the horse was on a
life-time loan agreement.

'I refused to give the horse back as I believed I rightfully owned her.

'We were good friends, I did some 
mucking out for her. She knew I could not afford a horse and I was 
extremely grateful that she gave me Stella.

'I do not know what made Dorothy change her mind.

'I do not want to fight with the 
woman. It is sad that it has got like this. It has hit my family hard 
too, my children are very upset and I am suffering from stress.

'She is making me out to be a horse thief and saying I do not look after horses properly.'

But
great-grandmother-of-three Ms Rugg-Easey insists she is the victim and 
has not slept properly since being beaten with the horse whip.

Speaking
after the hearing, Ms Rugg-Easey said: 'I have CCTV on my stables and 
when I was woken by the dogs barking I was up in a flash.

'I grabbed a three-foot schooling whip and went to see what was going on.

'This
big brute of a man was leaning on the stable door and when I asked him 
what he was doing he snatched the whip and starting hitting me with it.

'I was lying on the ground in my nightie with my legs kicking.

'I think he should have gone to prison and for a long time. I truly believe he came to get me and take the horse.'

Liz, a fitness instructor, came to her mother’s aid during the incident.

After
the court hearing she said: 'It must have been just after 1am. I could 
hear mum screaming and crying and thought ‘the old girl has finally lost
it.’

'When I saw him 
[Thompson] with the whip I thought I could calm the situation down but 
as soon as I went outside - and I was only wearing a long T-shirt and 
pair of knickers - he just punched me in the face.'

The feud started last year when natural health scientist Ms Rugg-Easey, who owns the small livery yard and Morgan stud farm, was forced to give up Stella when she was diagnosed with vertigo and doctors banned her from riding.

She says she entrusted Stella with former employee Ms Beavis under the agreement that she would be able to monitor her care at her stables.

But on the night of August 14, 2011, Stella, who Ms Rugg-Easey had owned for seven years and schooled for five, was taken from the farm.

The horse was kept away from the farm at another stables for almost a year before Ms Rugg-Easey took her back on August 7, 2012.

Ms Rugg-Easey claims Stella was worth around £50,000 when she loaned her, but when she got her back she was lame and now only worth around £2,000.

Then just four days after winning back her horse Ms Rugg-Easey, her daughter and granddaughter were attacked by drunk Thompson when he appeared in their stables.

Ms Rugg-Easey and her daughter, who was left with a black eye and whip marks after the attack, have now installed infra-red CCTV cameras at their home.

She said: 'I was told it would cost me 15 to 30 grand in legal expenses to prosecute her for stealing my horse - so I had no choice but to get her back myself.

'I put thousands of hours into schooling her and looking after her properly. Now she is lame.'

She added: 'She was worth £50, 000 when I loaned her. Now she is probably worth less than 2, 000 - or just butcher meat.

'It’s unbelievable that I have to keep going to court to prove I own a horse which I clearly do and have all the paper work for.'
