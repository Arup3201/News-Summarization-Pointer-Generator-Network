As Australian house prices continue to rise, it's becoming increasingly hard to find an affordable home close to capital cities and business hubs.

But Daily Mail Australia has found ten properties around Australia which are under $100,000. And some are only 25 minutes from a capital city. Others feature pools and even water views. 

The property finds come as a  new report released by RP Data this week has found houses selling for less than $400,000 across the capital cities are falling fast.

Less than 28 percent of properties in Australia are listed as selling at $400,000 in capital cities, while over 60 percent of regional properties can still be found at that price.

The RP Data report found the combined Australian capital median house price is $550,00, while the media unit price is $475,000.

'A rise in capital city home values of 10.1 per cent over the 12 months to June 2014 indicates the difficulty being experienced by price-sensitive purchasers looking to enter the housing market,' RP Data's Cameron Kusher said.

'This is most felt in Sydney and Melbourne where home values have increased by 15.4 percent and 9.4 per cent respectively over the year to June.'

The report also revealed that although properties in regional areas are definitely more affordable, job and employment prospects are substantially lower in these regions.

But the Daily Mail Australia has put together a list of ten suburbs and towns around the country where you can buy property for less than $100,000 _ without moving more than two hours away from a capital city.

This was despite being told repeatedly by estate agents it was impossible to buy for under $100,000.

While some of the houses, units or apartments may need a little work, by moving a little further out, the extra hour commute to work might just be worth it for the low price you'll pay for these homes.

It's also a short walk to local shops and the beach - and close to a golf course and a number of parks.
