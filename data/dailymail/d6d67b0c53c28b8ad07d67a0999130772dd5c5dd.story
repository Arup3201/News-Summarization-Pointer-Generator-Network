David Beckham's management today refuted claims he could be heading Down Under to play football.

The 37-year-old and his family currently live in LA, where he plays for Los Angeles Galaxy, but Australia's Football Federation (FFA) said it has been approached by his representatives.

It could mean the sight of Posh gliding through Sydney in her trademark sunglasses with well-travelled children Brooklyn, Cruz, Romeo and Harper Seven in tow.

Beckham signed a two-year deal with his current side in January, tying him to the U.S., but he could head across the world during the gap between seasons in the 
Major Soccer League.

The
former England captain's family would therefore not have to make another 
permanent move.

Beckham moved to the U.S. from Spain's Real Madrid as part of a £20million deal in 2007.

He has previously joined AC Milan on loan between MLS seasons, so this could be another chance for 
Victoria to tour the designer stores of the world's most 
glamorous cities.

Earlier this month, however, there were 
rumours that Victoria wanted to move to New York to pursue her 
flourishing fashion career.

An FFA spokesperson said: 'The approach from David Beckham's 
people is another sign of how much the Hyundai A-League has grown in 
stature on a global basis.

'Beckham is a superstar on the world 
stage and he would be another massive signing for the Hyundai A-League 
after the arrivals of Alessandro Del Piero, Emile Heskey and Shinji Ono. 

'But this approach remains at a very preliminary stage.'

Reports in Australia suggest that any move for Beckham would likely see him agree a 10-match stay.

A spokesman for Beckham, however, refuted the claim, saying: 'David is completely focused on the 
MLS play offs and winning another Championship with the Galaxy.

'There's always enormous interest from clubs across world in signing David. He has absolutely no plans to play in Australia.'

Beckham could play his last Galaxy 
game of the season this weekend when his side meet the Seattle Sounders 
in the second leg of their Western Conference Championship play-off.

Perth Glory have already stated an interest in Beckham and Lyall Gormal, executive chairman of the Western Sydney Wanderers, said the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star would have obvious commercial appeal.

He told Sky Sports News: 'We haven't had formal or informal contact over this, but clearly we are aware of the iconic vale of David Beckham.

'Beckham is outstanding. We've seen him here before on a couple of occasions. There was an 80,000 sell-out at the Olympic Stadium and he was here with the Galaxy the year before last for a game against the Newcastle Jets.

'He would be a fantastic commodity to bring to Australia.'

On the contradictory statements from the FFA and the Beckham camp, Mr Gormal added: 'It is puzzling isn't it?

'My understanding is there have been 
informal approaches to other clubs. One or two have already come out and
talked about their interest. Clearly there has been some informal 
discussions.'

Head boy: A spokesperson for Beckham has dismissed the story

Perth Glory chief 
executive Paul Kelly said: 'We are always happy to speak to 
players of the calibre of David Beckham, who would be great for the 
Hyundai A-League.

'At the end of the day it's the 
coach, Ian Ferguson, who makes these decisions and we as a club, have a 
process that we follow when recruiting players.

'But we would be mad not to seriously consider David Beckham.'

Yet Melbourne Victory coach Ange Postecoglou has ruled out making an approach for the football superstar.

'That's great if he is coming,' said Postecoglou in local media. 'Would we be interested? Nah.'
