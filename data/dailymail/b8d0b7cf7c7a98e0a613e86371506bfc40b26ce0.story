A newly discovered interview with Martin Luther King from 1960 can be heard for the first time, with experts hailing the find for giving a glimpse into the civil rights leader's time in Africa.

Raymond
 Winbush, director of the Institute for Urban Research at Maryland's 
Morgan State University, said the tape is significant because there are 
very few recordings of King detailing his activity in Africa.

He said: 'It's
 clear that in this tape when he's talking ... about Africa, he saw this
 as a global human rights movement that would inspire other 
organizations, other nations, other groups around the world,' said 
Winbush, who is also a psychologist and historian.

'That to me is what's remarkable about the tape.'

Many 
recordings of King are known to exist among hundreds of thousands of 
documents related to his life that have been catalogued and archived.

But Winbush said this latest find is unusual because
 there's little audio of King discussing his activities in Africa, while
 two of King's contemporaries said it's exciting to hear a little-known 
recording of their friend for the first time.

The surprise and potentially lucrative discovery was made in Tennessee a few months ago.

Stephon Tull was 
looking through dusty old boxes in his father's attic in Chattanooga when he stumbled onto something startling: an audio reel 
labeled, 'Dr. King interview, December 21, 1960'.

He
 wasn't sure what he had until he borrowed a friend's reel-to-reel 
player and listened to the recording of his father interviewing Martin 
Luther King Jr. for a book project that never came to fruition.

In clear
 audio, King discusses the importance of the civil rights movement, his 
definition of nonviolence and how a recent trip of his to Africa 
informed his views.

Tull said the recording had been in the attic for 
years, and he wasn't sure who other than his father may have heard it.

'No
 words can describe. I couldn't believe it,' he told The Associated 
Press in a phone interview from his home in Chattanooga. 'I 
found ... a lost part of history.'

Tull plans to offer the recording at a private sale arranged by a New York broker and collector later this month.

Tull
 said his father, an insurance salesman, had planned to write a book 
about the racism he encountered growing up in Chattanooga and later as 
an adult.

He said his dad interviewed King when he visited the city, but
 never completed the book and just stored the recording with some other 
interviews he had done. Tull's father is now in his early 80s and under 
hospice care.

During part of the interview, King defines nonviolence and justifies its practice.

'I
 would ... say that it is a method which seeks to secure a moral end 
through moral means,' he said. 'And it grows out of the whole concept of
 love, because if one is truly nonviolent that person has a loving 
spirit, he refuses to inflict injury upon the opponent because he loves 
the opponent.'

The interview was made four 
years before the Civil Rights Act became law, three years before King's 
famous 'I Have a Dream' speech, and eight years before his 
assassination. At one point in the interview, King predicts the impact 
of the civil rights movement.

'I am convinced 
that when the history books are written in future years, historians will
 have to record this movement as one of the greatest epics of our 
heritage,' he said.

King had visited Africa 
about a month before the interview, and he discusses with Tull's father 
how leaders there viewed the racial unrest in the United States.

'I
 had the opportunity to talk with most of the major leaders of the new 
independent countries of Africa, and also leaders in countries that are 
moving toward independence,' he said.

'And I think all of them agree 
that in the United States we must solve this problem of racial injustice
 if we expect to maintain our leadership in the world.'

U.S.
 Rep. John Lewis, a Freedom Rider and lunch counter protester who worked
 with King while a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
Committee, said hearing King talk about the sit-ins took him back to the
 period when more than 100 restaurant counters were desegregated over 
several months.

'To ... hear his voice and 
listen to his words was so moving, so powerful,' said Lewis, adding that
 King's principles of nonviolence are still relevant today.

'I wish people all over America, all over the world, can hear this message over and over again,' he said.

The Rev. Joseph Lowery, who founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King, agreed.

'I
 can't think of anything better to try,' Lowery said of nonviolence. 'What we're doing now is not working. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a 
tooth. Matching violence with violence. We've got more guns than we've 
ever had, and more ammunition to go with it. And yet, the situation 
worsens.'

A spokeswoman for King's daughter 
Bernice, head of The King Center in Atlanta, said she was traveling and 
couldn't comment on the audio.

Tull is working
 with a New York-based collector and expert on historical artifacts to 
arrange a sale.

The broker, Keya Morgan, said he believes that 
unpublished reel-to-reel audio of King is extremely rare and said he's 
confident of the authenticity of the recording based on extensive 
interviews with Tull, his examination of the tape and his knowledge of 
King.

He's collected many of the civil rights icon's letters and photos.

'I
 was like, wow! To hear him that crisp and clear,' Morgan said. 'But 
beyond that, for him to speak of nonviolence, which is what he 
represented.'

INTERVIEWER: 'In many of your writings, on your speeches, your talks, your lectures, you've used the term 'nonviolence' and 'Christian love,' what exactly does this mean?'

DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: 'Well, in short, I would say 'nonviolence' means the refusal to use violence in any way in order to achieve a social end. It means refusing to use external, physical violence, and also refusing to use internal violence of spirit.

'And I would also say that it is a method which seeks to secure a moral ends through moral means, and it rules out of the whole concept of love, because if one is truly nonviolent, that person has a loving spirit, he refuses to inflict injury upon the opponent, because he loves the opponent.

'And I think the two go together, that the idea of love is a basic part of the whole idea of nonviolence and vice versa.'INTERVIEWER: 'Doctor, you have visited Africa and many of our neighbors abroad, so exactly what effect, or rather, what reaction does the African have on the American Negro situation as it stands today in America and this country?'

DR. KING: 'Well, there's quite a bit of interest and concern in Africa, or the situation in the United States.

'African leaders in general, and African people in particular are greatly concerned about the struggle here and they are quite familiar with what is taking place, I just returned from Africa a little more than a month ago, and I had the opportunity to talk with most of the major leaders of new, independent countries in Africa, and also, leaders in countries that are moving toward independence, and I think all of them agree that in the United States, we must solve this problem of racial injustice if we expect to maintain our leadership in the world, and if we expect to serve as a moral voice in a world that is two-thirds color.'
