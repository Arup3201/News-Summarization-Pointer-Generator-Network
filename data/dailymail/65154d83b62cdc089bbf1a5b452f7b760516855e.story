It is certainly a unique sight, and one that could, it is claimed, save thousands of lives.

A bicycle with a giant set of light up cat's whiskers if the latest gadget aiming to make cyclist's lives safer.

They can be used to warn other road users a cyclist is approaching, let drivers know exactly how much space is needed, and even twitch to indicate a turn.

The life-saving whiskers: The strands of smart material can extend to mark space, and twitch when the user wants to turn

The four whiskers can change their configuration, allowing the cyclists to signal their intentions.

Controlled by a button on the handlebars, the four long whiskers on the Vibrasee can flick fully outward, discouraging a car from squeezing by.

Reflective stripes make each whisker stand out even more.

When a cyclist wants to turn, they can flick the whiskers on one side in the right direction and flash lights inside as a signal.

Called VibriSee, the whiskers were invented by students at California State University-Long Beach.

'When you’re in the middle of the street with cars, what tends to happen is drivers see the space around you and they’ll attempt to pass,' Channing Shattuck, who worked on the design for the Vibrasee with five fellow students, told Fastco.

'It’s dangerous for the cyclist, and dangerous for the car if there’s oncoming traffic. But what if we could expand the bike to look bigger, so cars don't try to go around?'

'Cycling as a form of transportation is a growing alternative to fossil-fuel powered vehicles, but as cycling grows more popular each year, cities like Long Beach are implementing initiatives to develop their infrastructure in order to accommodate this exploding demographic,' the students wrote.

'By interviewing various members of the Long Beach bicycle community, we were able to determine three main concerns: communication of a bicyclist’s intentions, increased visibility both day & night, and proper allocation of space when sharing the road.'

The team then spent time at zoos and animal parks to look at how nature approached the problem.

'By visiting various biomes within our city and with the help of university biologists, we identified several animals that have evolved attributes with the potential to solve these concerns - namely peacocks, ctenophores, and rodents.

'Using their unique traits, we designed VibriSee, a mountable bicycle accessory that sports flexible, illuminated whiskers.

'These luminescent tendrils provide the user with several opportunities,' the researchers say.

'First, they exponentially increase visibility of the cyclists both day and night through a combination of both fluorescent bands and stripes of emitted light.

'Second, these four whiskers can change their configuration, allowing the cyclists to signal their intentions.

'Finally, VibriSee empowers the cyclist with the ability to indicate their spatial zone by flaring their whiskers and flashing warning colors.'

The project was part of the Biomimicry Student Design Challenge, which asked design students to take inspiration from local ecology to tackle a transportation issue.
