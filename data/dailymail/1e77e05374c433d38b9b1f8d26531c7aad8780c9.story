A former anorexic has overcome his fear of food to become a bodybuilder. Jack Marsh, 23, from Middlesborough, used to skip meals and refused to eat anything he hadn't tried before.

He said: 'From a young age I had a severe fear of 
foods I hadn't tried before. I would tell myself I didn't like them or there was something wrong with them before I 
had even tried them.

'I could still play sports and run around without 
feeling the need for food so the slimmer and slimmer I became.'

Bulked up: Jack was skinny as a teenager, left, as he was afraid to eat foods he hadn't tried before but transformed his figure after he had to change his eating habits to be able to lift weights

Jack said teachers at his school tried to help him by encouraging - and sometimes tricking him - to eat.

However, it didn't work and as he grew skinnier, his self-esteem plummeted as he felt self-conscious about his eating habits and slim figure.

'In my 
early teens it became a bigger problem because people were always shocked by how I wouldn't eat at parties or 
restaurants and would only eat things I had tried before.

Beat his demons: Jack has now qualified as a personal trainer as he wants to help others who suffer from eating disorders learn about good nutrition

'I would be ridiculed and 
embarrassed and it made me feel I wasn't the same as the others,' he said.

'My ambition was to get a better body and not to feel weak, different and
embarrassed. I had to force myself to eat new things'

The turning point came when Jack became interested in fitness and wanted to start working out by lifting weights.

However, he found he wasn't capable of this without fuelling his body by eating properly.

He explains: 'When I became interested in fitness it became compulsory to eat new
foods. I was finding that no matter how I hard I worked, or how many hours spent in 
the gym, not eating right and not eating for a while was working against 
me.

Confidence boost: The 23-year-old used to be embarrassed by his figure but now wants to model

THEN

Breakfast: NothingLunch: A few chipsDinner: A small portion of spaghetti

NOW

Breakfast: Oatmeal and a bananaMid-morning: Two bananasLunch: Tuna, rice and salad, two slices wholemeal breadDinner: Chicken breast with sweet potatoes and vegSupper: Whey protein shake with a tablespoon of peanut butter

He will also take LA Muscles supplements through out the day

'My ambition was to get a better body and not to feel weak, different and
embarrassed. I had to force myself to eat new things.

'My desire to get away from my skinny self became greater 
than being afraid of trying new foods - so I beat my eating disorder because my 
goal of feeling and looking better was stronger than my fear.'

After changing his diet and taking protein supplements from LA Muscle, who are now his sponsors, Jack began to gain weight and became strong enough to work out for 45 minutes in the gym three days a week.

As a result, his figure is now completely transformed, he has defined pecs and an impressive six pack.

He now wants to compete in natural bodybuilding competitions and has qualified as a personal trainer so he can help others get fit.

He said: 'My goals for the future are to own gym, compete in competitions and appear in muscle model campaigns to show how far I have come and show how if I can do it, anyone can.'
