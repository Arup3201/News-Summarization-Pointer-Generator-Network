It is one of the worst moments in history, which still horrifies to this day.

During Hitler's brutal reign of Nazi Germany, more than six million Jews were killed.

But now new research has discovered that the Holocaust may well be even worse than previously thought.

Thirteen years ago, researchers at the United States Holocaust Memorial 
Museum began the task of documenting all the ghettos, slave labour 
sites, concentration camps and killing factories that the Nazis set up 
throughout Europe - and realised they had underestimated the extent of 
the Nazis' evil. This map shows the vast spread of SS concentration 
camps across Europe

Researchers at the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum have been documenting all of the Nazi 
concentration camps, ghettos, slave labour sites and killing factories 
which had been set up across Europe.

When they first started the project, the team expected to find about 7,000 camps and ghettos.

Shockingly,
 they discovered 42,500 camps across large swathes of German-controlled 
Europe.Â  The researchers predict that up to 20 
million people died or were imprisoned in the sites.

Speaking
 to the New York Times, Hartmut Berghoff, director of the institute, 
said: 'The numbers are so much higher than what we originally thought.

Horrific: The figures are much higher than  previously thought - researchers first thought that about 7,000 Nazi camps existed

Awful: Jewish men are pictured being  transported from the Warsaw Ghetto by Wehrmacht soldiers to work on sites elsewhere

When the project began, researchers thought they would find about 7,000 Nazi camps, only to find more than 40,000.

30,000 slave labour camps

1,150 Jewish ghettos

980 concentration camps

1,000 prisoner-of-war camps

500 brothels filled with sex slaves

'We knew before how horrible life in the camps and ghettos was but the numbers are unbelievable.'

The figure includes 30,000 slave labour camps and 980 concentration camps. As well as 'killing centres' they included forced labour
 camps where prisoners made supplies for the war.

They also included 
sites called 'care' centres in which pregnant women were made to have 
abortions or their babies murdered shortly after birth.

The researchers have created a series of
 maps which present a grim view of life in wartime Europe.They show just
 how widespread the camps were, although most were centred in Germany 
and Poland.

Previous data has 
shown just the existence of individual camps on a fragmented basis.

But using data from 400 contributors , they 
have now documented the large scale operation for the first time.

They have discovered exactly where they are located and how they were run.

It is now believed that the research could help survivors with their claims over unpaid insurance policies. Researchers say the project has helped change the understanding about Holocaust experts over how the camps were run.

The Warsaw Ghetto has been identified as the biggest site - holding about 500,000 people at one point.

When the project first started, the researchers expected to find about 7,000 Nazi camps and ghettos. But as the project has gone on, the numbers constantly increased to the current figure of 42,500.
