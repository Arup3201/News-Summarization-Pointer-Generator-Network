Ipswich Town have handed trials to Craig Bellamy's 17 year-old son Ellis.

Like his father Ellis can play as a winger or striker and has been with Cardiff City's youth squad as well as being capped at various levels by Wales up to U17. 

Bellamy senior, a close friend of academy coach Kieron Dyer from their time at Newcastle and West Ham together, was spotted in Ipswich on Tuesday.

Ex-Norwich mentor Steve Foley also coaches at Ipswich, and told East Anglian Daily Times: 'Craig rang up and asked if we would have a look at Ellis.

'He's been here a week or so and will be here next week too. He'll train with the Under-18s and 21s. If he's better than what we've got then he'll stay; it's as simple as that.

'Craig was at the training ground last week and was really good with the younger lads, answering all their questions. He's now gone on holiday and left Ellis to it.'
