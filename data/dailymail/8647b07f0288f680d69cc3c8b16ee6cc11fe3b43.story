Jose Mourinho will not face disciplinary action from UEFA after charging down the touchline as his Chelsea players celebrated their tie-clinching goal against Paris Saint-Germain.

After Demba Ba fired the ball past Salvatore Sirigu in the dying stages of the Champions League quarter-final second leg at Stamford Bridge, Mourinho sprinted out of his technical area to the corner flag, where his players were celebrating wildly.

But after grabbing a number of players and whispering instructions in their ears, UEFA have confirmed they will not take action against the Portuguese coach for entering the field of play.

After the match, Mourinho claimed he was not celebrating with his players, but instructing them on how to hold out for the win.

When asked what Mourinho was doing after the goal, he said: 'Not celebrating. To tell Fernando and Demba the changes we had to do because three minutes plus extra time the way we were playing was too risky.'

On Thursday morning Mourinho was 
fined Â£8,000 by the Football Association and reminded of his 
responsibilities as a Premier League manager after being sent to the 
stands by Chris Foy during Chelsea's defeat by Aston Villa last month.

But the former Porto, Inter Milan and Real Madrid manager has escaped punishment from Europe's governing body.
