The Boston Marathon bombing suspect set to go on trial in January wants his fans kept away from the courthouse to stop them from spouting conspiracy theories, according to court documents.

Defense lawyers for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev submitted documents pleading for a federal judge to remove 'self-appointed supporters' from the steps of the Boston courthouse, Yahoo News reports.

The 21-year-old's legal team argues demonstrators 'advocate various conspiracy theories concerning the marathon bombing, including that the resulting deaths and injuries have somehow been faked as part of a government plot.'

Demonstrations: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is set to go on trial in January, wants 'self-appointed' fans kept away from the courthouse

Stating that the protesters would have a 'deleterious and prejudicial impact' by pushing false-flag conspiracy theories in the faces of those at the courthouse, lawyers for Tsarnaev asked they be moved away from the courthouse by US Marshals.

'Survivors, jurors, witnesses and members of the public must be able to attend court without being assaulted by inflammatory accusations from any source,' documents state.

His lawyers argue that demonstrators 'continuing presence in the immediate vicinity of the courthouse entryways ... poses a grave threat' to a fair trial.

The defense mentioned survivor Marc Fucarile, who confronted a group of women with signs on his way into the courthouse Thursday, as an example of the effect of demonstrations.

Fucarile shook his prosthetic leg in front of one protester who called the case against Tsarnaev 'trickery' before continuing into the courthouse.

Tsarnaev's lawyers have also sought to move the trial out of Massachusetts, citing in a pretrial motion Monday that 'greater Boston, was itself, a victim.'

Trial: Tsarnaev, depicted in a court sketch at a pretrial hearing, will face the start of his trial for his alleged role in the Boston Marathon in January, though lawyers want the trial moved out of Boston

Removed: Lawyers asked that 'supporters' of Tsarnaev be removed so as not to create a 'deleterious and prejudicial impact' by pushing  conspiracy theories at those coming to the court

Transported: Tsarnaev is put into another vehicle while being taken from a hearing in federal court on Thursday

The defense states finding an impartial jury would be difficult because 'the crimes charged inflicted actual injury on the entire local population,' according to documents.

Attorneys also claim that 'adverse pretrial publicity and leaks continue unabated' and that 'media saturation' will increase with the beginning of the trial in January and the April anniversary of the bombing. 

The request echoed the demands by Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, whose 1997 trial was moved to Denver.

McVeigh was ultimately given a death sentence and executed for the bombing, which killed 168 people and injured many more.

Prosecutors had previously opposed a change-of-venue request on the grounds that previous trials similar to Tsarnaev's were able to assemble impartial juries.

Three people were killed and more than 260 injured after two bombs were detonated at the finish line of the marathon in April 2013. 

Tsarnaev could face the death penalty if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges brought against him.
