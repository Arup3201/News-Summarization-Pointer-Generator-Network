With spring still months away and a winter chill in the air, the idea of escaping to a beautiful beach seems ideal.

And if you'd like to head to the best stretch of sand in the world, you'll need to visit Brazil and the Baia do Sancho, according to the world's travel community.

Located on the beautiful Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha, off the coast of Fortaleza, the beach has been voted the best in the world by reviewers on TripAdvisor.
