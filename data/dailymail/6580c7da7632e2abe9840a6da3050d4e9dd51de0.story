The Cambridge graduate son-in-law of an elderly billionaire Monaco heiress has 'recognised his involvement' in her murder, prosecutors have said.

Wojciech Janowski, 64, was arrested along with his wife Sylvia Pastor this week suspected of 'masterminding' the assassination of 77-year-old Hélène Pastor.

Janowski, who has been Poland's Honorary Consul in Monaco since 2007, has now admitted a role in the murder, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin has said.

Sylvia Pastor has been released without charge, the BBC has reported.

Police have also reportedly released ten other suspects out of a total of 23 arrested in Nice, Marseille and Rennes.

Hélène Pastor and her chauffeur both died after they were gunned down outside L'Archet hospital, in Nice, on May 6.

Two suspected hitmen were traced after police studied DNA evidence and CCTV footage from the area where Mrs Pastor and her chauffeur were killed.

The alleged killers, aged 24 and 31, originally from the Comoros islands, both have criminal convictions.

CCTV video shows the two men took a train from Marseille to Nice on the day of the shooting, went to a hotel and then made their way to the scene of the crime, Mr Robin has said.

One of the men is thought to have left his face uncovered.

Detectives investigating the murder have traced ‘suspicious financial movements’ into an account belonging to Mr Janowski.

Earlier this week, a spokesman for the
 Marseille prosecutor, which is leading the investigation into the 
double murder, said: 'A number of arrests have been made, and a police 
operation in connection with the killings is ongoing.'

Statement: Prince Albert II of Monaco has expressed 'deep support' for the Pastor family

French
 MP Eric Ciotti expressed his 'extreme shock' at the double 
assassination, while Prince Albert II of Monaco issued a statement 
expressing 'deep support' for the Pastor family.

Mrs Pastor was the sister of Michel Pastor, the former chairman of AS Monaco football club who died in February.

Her daughter and son, already rich in their own right, would have become billionaires on their mother's death.

The Marseille prosecutor has opened a judicial enquiry into the double murder, parts of which were captured on CCTV.

'We
 are studying frozen images of the attack in an attempt to identify the 
attackers, and witnesses,' said an investigating source.

He said that an alleged blackmailer had been contacting the Pastor family, and was currently undergoing 'psychiatric tests'.

Mrs Pastor's grandfather was an Italian immigrant who developed large parts of Monaco before handing his business over to her father, Gildo Pastor.

The principality is a tax haven which is regularly linked with organised crime gangs, as well as prominent individuals who want to keep the source of their wealth a closely guarded secret.
