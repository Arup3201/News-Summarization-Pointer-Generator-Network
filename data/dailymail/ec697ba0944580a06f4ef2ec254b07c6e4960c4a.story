Twitter has been forced to apologise for mistakenly resetting 'a large number' of its 500m user's accounts following a major hacker attack on the social networking site.

Users including the BBC's Today show and comedian David Mitchell were hit by the large 'phishing' scam

However, while investigating the issue, Twitter says its security specialists had reset a larger number of passwords than they intended.

Twitter tried to calm users after accidentally saying that 'a large number' of their 140 million accounts were compromised

Some of the attempted hacks used phrases
like 'serious gossip' or 'that video' or 'saying bad things [about 
you]' with a link to a phishing or malware site.

In order to avoid such scams, users were 
advised to check that the proper Twitter website, http://twitter.com, 
was visible in the web browser bar instead of a similar alternative.

'In instances when we believe an account may have been compromised, we reset the password and send an email letting the account owner know this has happened,' Twitter said in its blog on Thursday.

'In this case, we unintentionally reset passwords of a larger number of accounts, beyond those that we believed to have been compromised.'

Among the victims of the original hack was the technology site Techcrunch, which has 2.5m followers, and tweeted a link which could helped the problem spread.

The Twitter account belonging to BBC Radio 4's Today programme also told followers it was 'trying to get to the bottom' of problems relating to their feed.

Other BBC accounts have received the warning email - but it is not yet clear if any more were compromised.

Comedian David Mitchell tweeted that he had received the email, and that a tweet he had written publicising his column in the Observer newspaper had been removed.

Comedian David Mitchell was also affected

Some of the attempted hacks used phrases like 'serious gossip' or 'that video' or 'saying bad things [about you]' with a link to a phishing or malware site.

Carolyn Penner, a spokeswoman for the social-networking site, declined to say how many Twitter accounts were affected by the error.

She said that there had not been a security breach.

Twitter, which is based in San Francisco,
regularly resets the passwords of accounts believed to have been 
infiltrated by hackers or suspicious websites.

Threatened: Twitter founder Jack Dorsey has not spoken publicly about the issue but the company issued a statement urging online caution

The company used the mass email as an opportunity to remind users of some key security tips to avoid hacking in the future.

They suggested to avoid pitches from companies that promise to increase the number of followers as 'these sites have been known to damage user accounts'.

Another area for concern that they addressed were Phishing sites that steal visitor's data when accessed.

In order to avoid such scams, users were advised to check that the proper Twitter website, http://twitter.com, was visible in the web browser bar instead of a similar alternative.
