Bradford City boss Phil Parkinson has revealed he refused Chelsea counterpart Jose Mourinho's handshake during the latter stages of their FA Cup tie on Saturday, as he didn't want to tempt fate.

Mourinho came over to the Bradford dugout to prematurely congratulate Parkinson and his staff after Mark Yates' goal put the visitors 4-2 ahead in injury time at Stamford Bridge.

However, Parkinson sent the Premier League boss packing as he didn't want to exchange in the pleasantries until the full-time whistle when the fourth round result was finalised.

CLICK HERE to read why Jose Mourinho said on Friday that it would be a 'disgrace' if Chelsea got knocked lost to Bradford in the FA Cup.

'He [Mourinho] came over to shake hands but at that point there was still three-and-a-half minutes left and I wasn't getting drawn into that,' Parkinson said in his post-match press conference.

'You know that if Chelsea got one [goal] back even at that late stage, and with their world class players on the pitch, they could easily have got a second [goal] so we wanted to concentrate on what we had to do and see the game through.

'He came in the dressing room afterwards [though] and shook everyone's hands - crediting the lads for their performances, which I thought was a real touch of class.'

Premier League leaders Chelsea looked firm favourites to reach the fifth round of the FA Cup, when Gary Cahill and Ramires gave them a 2-0 lead after 38 minutes.

However, Jon Stead pulled one back for the League One side just three minutes later before second-half strikes from Felipe Morais, Andy Halliday and Yeates completed a remarkable comeback for the Bantams.

It's not the first-time this season that Mourinho has tried to shake hands with an opposing manager before the full-time whistle.

Earlier this season in September, the Portuguese boss incensed Aston Villa counterpart Paul Lambert and his then-assistant manager Roy Keane.

Chelsea were leading 3-0 when Mourinho decided to beat the traffic and walk down the Stamford Bridge tunnel, but the 'Special One' halted to say his goodbyes to Lambert and assistant manager Roy Keane first.

Instead, Lambert snubbed the 51-year-old's prematurely out-stretched hand and pointed to his watch to tell the former Real Madrid and Inter Milan manager that time wasn't quite up yet.

It was more of an acknowledgement than Keane offered, though, as the stern former Manchester United midfielder simply ignored him.

Mourinho previously admitted after being criticised for leaving early during Chelsea's 6-0 win against Arsenal in March that he was born of a desire to phone his wife with the result.
