An aerial acrobat injured during a daring circus stunt said today that she heard a huge popping noise before her and seven other female performers plummeted to the ground.

Samantha Pitard, from Illinois, suffered spinal fractures, a cut on her head which required three stitches and bit her tongue hard on landing.

She said today that she was a 'little bit sore' but pleased that she had no pain from her fractures.

Samantha Pitard, from Illinois, suffered spinal fractures but said she expected to make a full recovery and would return to aerial stunts

She told GMA on Wednesday that all of the performers were expected to fully recover.

'Someone was watching over us for sure,' she said.

Miss Pitard said the performers have done the act hundreds of times and that the troop leader's  main priority is safety. She said that they were connected up as normal ahead of Sunday night's stunt.

She said: 'The curtain went down as normal and then we heard a huge popping noise and just plummeted to the ground. I caught my breath and I landed sitting up.'

She immediately looked around to see how the other performers were. Paramedics told her everyone was alive and conscious.

Miss Pitard said that although she would be going back in the air: 'I'm not sure any of us will do hair again' referring to the stunt where the women dangle by their locks.

'I'm hoping to join back up with the tour
 and show the world that I'm OK, and I'm hoping some of the other girls 
will do the same,' Samantha Pitard told The Associated Press on Tuesday after she was released from a hospital.

Investigators suspect that a snapped clip sent the eight aerial acrobats plummeting to the ground.  The investigation into the failed clip is ongoing. 

One injured performer told her father she didn't notice anything amiss before her 'plunge into darkness'.

Another woman told Sgt. Sean Carroll: 'I can't feel my legs.'

After the accident, a 4- to 5-inch steel clip or carabiner was found in three pieces on the ground with its spine snapped.

 Public Safety Commissioner Steven Pare stopped short of saying the 
carabiner caused Sunday's accident at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum and 
Bailey circus, witnessed by about 3,900 people, many of them children.

The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration is trying to 
make a final determination.

'We don't know if it was metal fatigue, if it wasn't properly positioned or something else,' Pare said. 'We just don't know.'

Performance gone wrong: An injured female performer is lifted onto a stretcher after a platform collapsed during an aerial hair-hanging stunt at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus in Providence

Eight performers remained hospitalized Monday after a platform collapsed during a performance by the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Providence, Rhode Island on Sunday

All eight of the acrobats were hospitalized with injuries including a pierced liver and neck and back fractures, as well as head injuries.

None of the injuries appear to be life-threatening, said Stephen Payne, a spokesman for Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company.

The last two acrobats in critical condition were upgraded to serious condition on Monday night. Four of the acrobats were in good condition and four in serious.

 Steven Pare said investigators know that at least one clamp - D-ring 
carabiner - attaching the human chandelier to the rafters at the Dunkin'
 Donuts Center failed.

Eleven people were admitted to hospital on Sunday after the platform collapsed during an aerial hair-hanging stunt,
 sending eight acrobats plummeting to the ground.

Two of the performers had 
surgery, including Widny Neves, 25, who suffered a badly broken arm. Her
 father Roiter told NBC News that it is a miracle that no one died.

In addition to a broken arm, his daughter suffered minor fractures to her back and neck and will need months of physical therapy to recover.

The women are from the United States, Brazil, Bulgaria and Ukraine, the circus said. A dancer on the ground was also injured and was released from the hospital on Sunday.

The rigging for the show was designed by the troupe's founder, Andre Medeiros, whose wife Viktoriya was in the air and is among the injured.

The seriously injured 
suffered broken bones and internal bleeding, while several other staff suffered minor 
injuries. No audience members were hurt.

'All performers have received medial treatment and are resting comfortably, we are pleased though their injuries are serious none appear to be life threatening,' said Stephen Payne, a spokesman for Feld Entertainment, the parent company of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.

Suddenly the platform crashed to the ground on Sunday night and a loud gasp of horror can be heard from the audience
