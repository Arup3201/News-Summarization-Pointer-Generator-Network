A Tory MP has called for the resignation of Sir David Nicholson for 'presiding over a culture of secrecy and cover-up that cost many people their lives'.

Andrew Bridgen, one of whose constituents died in the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal, said the NHS chief executive should quit because of his involvement in the controversy.

Between 400 and 1,200 died needlessly between 2005 and 2008 because bosses at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust put meeting Labour government targets ahead of patient safety.

Time to go: The Daily Mail has called Sir David Nicholson to account over the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal

Sir David was previously head of West Midlands Strategic Health Authority between 2005 and 2006 – the body supervising Mid Staffordshire – but failed to pick up on the horrific standards of care.

In fact at the height of the scandal, he wrote a letter congratulating managers having toured the trust's two hospitals, Stafford and Cannock Chase.

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, one of whose constituents died in the scandal, has called on Sir David to resign

Sir David insists he is 'not ashamed' to still be in his job and has blamed failings on the 'whole system'.

But nine out of ten NHS staff believe he should quit his £270,000-a-year post, two polls revealed last week.

In an article published today, Mr Bridgen, who represents Leicestershire North West, also attacks the 'culture of cosy cover-ups' in the NHS including the gagging orders imposed on doctors, nurses and managers.

Last week the Daily Mail revealed that in only three years there were 598 'special severance payments', almost all of which carried draconian confidentiality clauses aimed at silencing whistleblowers. They cost the taxpayer £14.7million.

Mr Bridgen said: 'I think it is very difficult to lead an organisation where 90 per cent of the staff do not have confidence in you, so he should consider his position.'

He writes on the ConservativeHome website: 'It is becoming increasingly clear that a culture of cosy cover-ups has been allowed to develop in the NHS and that is something that has got to change.

'Whilst I have no doubt that Sir David Nicholson is committed and knowledgeable about the NHS, you cannot get away from the fact that he has presided over a culture of secrecy and cover up that has cost many people their lives.

'Can a man so embroiled in this culture really be the person to oversee what Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt calls a new culture of openness and transparency... to ensure we never repeat the mistakes'?'

Shocking: Stafford General Hospital was one of two where between 400 and 1,200 patients died needlessly

Mr Bridgen's article concludes: 'Failing like this would not be tolerated in a private hospital and they should not be tolerated within the NHS.

'In the private sector, management would have been held accountable. We need to usher in a new era of transparency and candour if we are to address failures of care within the NHS.'

Mr Bridgen's constituents include the family of John Moore-Robinson, 20, who died in 2006 from internal bleeding which was not picked up by doctors in Stafford Hospital's A&E unit.

He had fallen off his mountain bike and ruptured his spleen. He was vomiting and in agony but was diagnosed with a few fractured ribs and sent home with painkillers. He died hours later at his home in Coalville, Leicestershire.

He also believes Labour health secretary Andy Burnham should have held a public inquiry into the failings at Mid Staffordshire, which may have brought these to light earlier.

Failure: Sir David even wrote letters congratulating the hospitals' managers at the height of the scandal

It has emerged that Mr Burnham rejected 81 requests for a full public inquiry in the last year of Labour's government 2009-10, 20 from MPs and the others from the public, victims and organisations.

Mr Bridgen's intervention is significant because he is a Tory MP and his call for Sir David to quit goes against David Cameron, who seems determined  to prop him up.

The Prime Minister said last week that Sir David has his full backing and that he 'does a very good job'.

Mr Cameron said: 'It seemed to me that he had properly apologised and acknowledged the mistakes that the regional health authority had made.

'We should not be seeking scapegoats and I think to highlight David Nicholson in that way would be seeking a scapegoat.'
