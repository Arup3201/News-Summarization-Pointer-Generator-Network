Watching a classic film at Christmas is as much a part of the festive season as eating mince pies and giving presents.

And it seems we still love the golden oldies as the 1946 Jimmy Stewart feel-good film 'It's a Wonderful Life' has topped a list of the best-reviewed Christmas movies.

Other favourites in the top five on the list - released by the Rotten Tomatoes website - included the 1942 Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire musical 'Holiday Inn' and Tim Burton's 'The Nightmare Before Christmas,' while blockbuster action films Die Hard and Lethal Weapon were also highly rated.

Favourites: Tim Burton's 1993 film 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' came third on the list

Classic: The 1947 film 'Miracle on 34th Street,' starring Edmund Gwenn (left) as Kris Kringle and Natalie Wood (right) also made it into the top five reviewed Christmas films

'It's a Wonderful Life' vaulted to 
the top spot from being voted in at number five in 2009, when the list was last compiled, 
bumping 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' from its best-reviewed status.

World War Two drama 'Stalag 17,' released in 1953, and 1947's 'Miracle on 34th Street' also came in the top five.

Films that use the festive season as a backdrop
for the plot such as 'Die Hard,' which was number six on the list, 
and 1983's 'Trading Places' at number nine, were also eligible, the website 
said.

Genres: Action films were also popular with reviewers. Lethal Weapon (1987) starring Danny Glover (left) and Mel Gibson came in 11th place

Loved: The 1983 film Trading Places with Dan Aykroyd (left) and Eddie Murphy also came in the top ten best-reviewed films

Rated: Elf, starring Will Ferrell (left) as 'Buddy' and Ed Asner as Santa Claus was highly rated by reviewers

Rotten Tomatoes, which 
analyses film reviews and assigns a score based on total critical 
reception, applied that same formula to Christmas films for the list, 
Matt Atchity, the website's editor in chief, said.

'You look at the list and it's all the classics ... the cream floats to the top,' he said, adding that the rankings were weighted to reflect the amount of reviews a film received, which could artificially boost or decline a score.

Films from the 1960s and 1970s were notably absent from the list.

Mr Atchity said studios were more focused at that time on work by big-name directors than on seasonal films.

Directed by Frank Capra, 'It's a Wonderful Life' is based on the short story 'The Greatest Gift,' written by Philip Van Doren Stern in 1939.

It has since become traditional viewing over Christmas in the US and across the world.

The film focuses on the experiences of George Bailey (played by Stewart), who has given up his dreams in order to help others.

His imminent suicide on Christmas Eve brings about the intervention of a guardian angel, called Clarence Odbody (played by Henry Travers).

The guardian angel shows George Bailey how he has made a difference to the lives of others.

The film caused some controversy at the time when the FBI issued a memo suggesting it had attempted to discredit bankers by casting Lionel Barrymore as a 'scrooge-type' character.

This was a serious issue at a time when life in the US was consumed by anti-Communist paranoia, investigations and court trials.

The film was nevertheless embraced by the American public, with Jimmy Stewart declaring it the favourite of his movies during an interview with Michael Parkinson in 1973.

All of the films in the Rotten Tomatoes list have made millions in royalties since they were released.
