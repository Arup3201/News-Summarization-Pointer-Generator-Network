With its ban on alcohol and rules ordering women to cover up, it is not the most obvious summer holiday destination.

But that has not stopped Iran from experiencing a surge in tourism from the UK, with bookings at travel agencies up by as much as 400 per cent.

For years, the hardline regime of anti-western former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad put off all but the most adventurous travellers. But the arrival of football-loving Hassan Rouhani as his successor last year appears to have made the Middle Eastern country seem friendlier.

Jonny Bealby, managing director of Wild Frontiers, which has been organising trips to Iran for ten years, hopes to send up to 150 customers this year, compared with a few dozen in 2013.

Mr Bealby said: ‘With the new man in charge and the easing of relations, a lot more people feel safe to go there.’

In the Ahmadinejad years, Mr Bealby 
said his company would provide just one or two organised tours for up to
 12 people at a time, and arrange ‘a handful’ of trips for individuals 
or couples.

‘Things have 
changed completely this year,’ he said. ‘In 2012, it was hard to sell 
Iran at all and in 2013 we had just two group tours running. This year 
we are running nine.

‘We are also providing tailor-made trips for dozens more people. In total, we are approaching 150 bookings so far in 2014.’

Wild Frontiers’ group tours cost 
£2,795 per person for a fortnight or £1,995 for 10 days, taking in 
ancient fortresses, mosques, bazaars, royal gardens and Iran’s National 
Museum in Tehran, which displays its crown jewels and peacock throne.

There are no direct flights from the UK to Iran so travellers have to change in either Istanbul or Dubai.

Mr
 Bealby said: ‘Travel to Iran has never been a problem in the years 
we’ve been running tours. As long as people going there are sensible, we
 have partners in Iran who know what they are doing and our customers 
are well looked-after.’

‘The
 issue has always been the way Iran has been perceived. Under 
Ahmadinejad this was a particular problem, especially with the attack on
 the British Embassy in Tehran in 2011 but with the new man in charge 
and the easing of relations, a lot more people feel safe to go there.’

Sarah Bareham, marketing executive at Brighton-based Responsible Travel, which also organises tours of the country, said: ‘Since January we have had the same number of bookings that we had in the whole of 2013.’

Michael Pullman, marketing manager at Wild Frontiers, based in Barnes, south London, has just returned from one of the company’s tours to Iran and describes the country as ‘amazing’.

He said: ‘It was a really interesting place, full of history, amazing architecture and mosques.

‘Probably the biggest surprise was how friendly and welcoming the people were - everywhere we went we were surrounded by people wanting to ask us questions about topics ranging from politics to the Premier League.

‘The officials were very low-key and although they probably knew where we were, there wasn’t any visible presence monitoring our movements.’

Among the hotels Mr Pullman stayed in was the 300-year-old Abbassi Hotel, Esfahan, a one-time favourite of the Shah prior to the 1979 Islamic revolution.

He said: ‘The hotels were all clean and comfortable but there was an atmosphere faded grandeur, which is a symptom of the economic sanctions and Iran having been off the tourist map for so long.

‘There were very few Brits but we met a few French and Germans.’

But despite the friendly welcome, Mr Pullman said alcohol remains banned, women have to disguise their body shape and wear scarves and, while men are permitted western clothing, shorts are not allowed.

Other down-sides include Western credit or debit cards not working in Iran, so tourists need to bring cash to exchange.

Wild Frontiers’ brochure describes ‘fascinating’ Iran as ‘one of the most misunderstood countries on earth’.

Other specialist travel agencies have also reported rising bookings for Iran in the last 12 months.

But Government advice on trips to the Middle Eastern country remains cautious.

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: ‘We would advise people to keep up to date with our relevant travel advice on Iran.

‘We advise against all but essential travel to the country as a whole and against all travel to regions close to the Iraq and Afghanistan borders.

‘There are risks for British nationals in Iran and especially those going off the beaten track - but it’s a matter of choice for individuals.’
