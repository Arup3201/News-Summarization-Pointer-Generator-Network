Super bugs from Earth could soon hitch a ride into space, arrive on the red planet and trick scientists into thinking they are Martians.

This is according to Nasa researcher, Dr Kasthuri Venkateswaran, who has expressed serious concern that microbes may beat humans in the race to colonise Mars.  

Dr Venkateswaran highlights recent research that shows some bugs are more resilient than first thought and could use protective mechanisms to survive deep space flights.

In a simulated Martian environment some spores in the study were able to survive at 1.5 years - and some had become even hardier than when they arrived. Pictured is a close up of of Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 spores on aluminum before (left) and after (right) exposure to space conditions

Currently, spacecraft landing on Mars or other planets where life might exist must meet requirements for a maximum allowable level of microbial life.

These acceptable levels were based on studies of how various life forms survive exposure to the challenges associated with space travel.

‘If you are able to reduce the numbers to acceptable levels, a proxy for cleanliness, the assumption is that the life forms will not survive under harsh space conditions,’ Dr Venkateswaran said.

However, spores of Bacillus pumilus have shown high resistance to techniques used to clean spacecraft, such as ultraviolet radiation and peroxide treatment.

Bacillus pumilus is a a rod-shaped bacteria that, on Earth, resides in soils and the root area of some plants.

In one study, Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 spores were exposed for 18 months on the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF). Pictured is the EuTEF attached to the Columbus module of the International Space Station during orbital flight

Nasa chiefs have said that sending a manned mission to Mars is 'necessary if the human race is to survive'.  

But the huge amounts of chemical rocket fuel needed to complete such a mission would require deep pockets – the launch costs alone would be more than $12 billion (£7 billion).

Added to this is the time it takes. The space agency estimates that a round-trip human expedition to Mars would take more than four years using current technology.  

Rocket-powered fusion, however, could one day allow 30- and 90-day expeditions to Mars by making the trip more practical and less costly, experts claim.

Scientists envision using a nuclear reactor to heat hydrogen to very high temperatures, which will then expand through a spacecraft’s nozzle to generate thrust.   

Recent advances in manipulating nuclear fusion could means that astronauts are now a step closer to our nearest planetary neighbour.  

When researchers exposed this hardy organism to a simulated Mars environment that kills standard spores in 30 seconds, it survived 30 minutes.

For another study, Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 spores were exposed for 18 months on the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF).

‘After testing exposure to the simulated Mars environment, we wanted to see what would happen in real space and EuTEF gave us the chance,’ Dr Venkateswaran said.‘To our surprise, some of the spores survived for 18 months.’

These surviving spores had higher concentrations of proteins associated with UV radiation resistance and, in fact, showed elevated UV resistance when re-exposed on Earth.

The findings could provide an insight into how super bugs are able to survive in extremely hostile regions on Earth and how these microbes are affected by radiation.

In another investigation, other spore-forming bacteria Bacillus subtilis were dried on pieces of spacecraft-quality aluminum and subjected for 1.5 years to the vacuum of space, cosmic and extra-terrestrial solar radiation and temperature fluctuations.

Most of the organisms exposed to solar UV radiation in space and in the Mars spectrum were killed, but when UV rays were filtered out and samples were kept in the dark, about 50 per cent or more of those subjected to other space- and Mars-like conditions survived.

A third study placed rock-colonising cellular organisms in the EuTEF facility for 1.5 years, further testing a theory of how organisms might move from one planet to another, known as lithopanspermia.

In this scenario, rocks ejected from a planet by impact with, say, a meteor, carried organisms on their surface through space and then landed on another planet, bringing that life with them.

For this investigation, researchers selected organisms especially adapted to cope with the environmental extremes of their natural habitats on Earth, and found that some are also able to survive in the even more hostile environment of outer space.

The findings will also help prevent scientists from incorrectly identifying an organism that hitchhiked on the exploring spacecraft as a native of the planet, when in fact it was an invader.
