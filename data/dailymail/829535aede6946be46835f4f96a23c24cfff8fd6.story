A couple of years ago, I stepped off a plane at a small airport in a far corner of the planet, and caught a taxi into town.

You do not really notice Ushuaia as you enter it – because, despite marketing itself as the world’s most southerly city, there is not a great deal of it.

But what you do spot, about halfway through the cab ride, is the memorial to the Argentinian dead of the Falklands War, placed very prominently at the roadside. Indeed, you cannot miss it.

This stark slab of iron – from which the outline of the Falklands archipelago (or Las Malvinas, as the Argentinians prefer to call it) has been cut – could scarcely be described as pretty.

But it makes a firm point: What happened in 1982 has not been forgotten here. 

Under fire: The Top Gear team - with Jeremy Clarkson centre of image, seated - while filming in Argentina

My mind has drifted back to that memorial over the last couple of days, as the furore over the actions of the Top Gear team, and its star Jeremy Clarkson, has gathered momentum. 

For those of you who have missed this ‘event’ (perhaps you have better things to do with your life, or perhaps you prefer some news with your news stories), Clarkson has been accused of angering the locals in southernmost Argentina by driving around in a Porsche whose number plate apparently references the Falklands War.

The plate in question reads ‘H982 FKL’. A line of numbers and letters which has been taken by the Argentinian media to refer to the year of the conflict, 1982 – and the islands over which it was fought.

Cue unpleasant scenes in Ushuaia, this outpost at the foot of South America – with various reports of vehicles being pelted with stones, the Top Gear presenters being pursued to the Chilean border by a mob, and police assistance required to get them out of the country.

Cause of controversy: Clarkson's 1991 Porsche, with the number plate that has been seen as a war reference

After the event: The same Porsche is seen with damage to its windscreen after an encounter with a local mob

All very unsavoury, then, with Top Gear cast, again, in an unpleasant light, and Ushuaia – an important tourist destination – doing its image a considerable disservice.

The city is the key point of access for the spectacular islands of Tierra del Fuego – the fractured lower tip of South America – as well as voyages that venture to Antarctica.

But as with a juvenile spat in 2012, where two British ships were refused harbour in a show of lingering bad feeling, Ushuaia is once more in focus for reasons other than its glorious scenery.

Naturally, Top Gear has issued the requisite denials. The number plate was a coincidence, we have been told – a work of total chance. The 1991 Porsche came with the plate when it was bought by the show back in August – acquired specifically for the 1350-mile drive through Argentina which has been filmed for the programme’s 2014 Christmas special.

Make of that what you will, although bear in mind that Clarkson has a record of trying to offend his hosts when filming Top Gear in overseas locations – in 2012, he prompted complaints from the Indian High Commission after driving in India with a lavatory strapped to the back of his fast Jaguar, in a glib pot-shot at the country’s sanitation issues. 

Doomed: The sinking of the General Belgrano in 1982 was the most controversial moment in the Falklands War

Not forgotten: The General Belgrano sailed from Ushuaia in April 1982 - and its sinking is still keenly felt there

Perhaps the producers are telling the truth. Perhaps serendipity has frowned upon Top Gear, handing it the equivalent of a Countdown Conundrum that it could not solve.

But what should be very clear is that if this was a deliberate stunt, pulled by the makers of the show in a gesture of boys’-club humour, then it was both crass and insensitive.

Thirty-two years after its outbreak, the Falklands War is still a notoriously thorny issue between Britain and Argentina – and it remains a highly troublesome topic in Ushuaia.

The losses of the war are still keenly felt in the city because the conflict’s most difficult moment – the sinking of the Argentine warship General Belgrano – had its roots here.

The naval cruiser set sail from Ushuaia on 26 April 1982. Six days later, it was sunk by the British nuclear submarine HMS Conqueror, with the deaths of 323 men on board. 

Site of remembrance: Ushuaia has a very visible memorial to the Argentinian dead of the Falklands War

Very much an emotive issue: The war is still a big topic in a city that played a direct role in the events of 1982

The incident has helped to keep the fires of the Falklands debate aflame ever since.

Notoriously, the General Belgrano was outside the 200-mile exclusion zone around the archipelago that had been declared by Britain as a theatre of definite conflict – and was sailing west, away from the Falklands, and back towards the Argentinian mainland.

Some naval officials in Argentina – including Héctor Bonzo, the doomed vessel’s captain – have described the sinking as a legitimate military act, revealing that the ship was mid-manoeuvre, and ready to attack. Others, including some here in Britain, have called it a war crime.

The rights and wrongs of the assault on the Belgrano are never likely to be resolved into one smooth narrative. But you do not need a degree in military history to understand that the subject is still emotive in a city that waved farewell to the dead men. Nor do you need a Masters in geography to appreciate that people are still upset in a place that sits just 400 miles from the Falklands (a hop and skip in a region of long distances and empty horizons).

And you do not need to be an apologist for Argentina’s aggression and invasion of the Falklands in 1982 to realise that people mourn their loved ones who do not return home. 

Missing the point: Jeremy Clarkson's latest Twitter defence fails to understand why people might be upset

Argentina lost 649 soldiers in the conflict. Half of them passed through Ushuaia en route to a watery grave. In other words, it is not a city where you make jokes about the war.

It is certainly not a place where you make references that treat the drowning of so many sailors as if it were the result of a football match. Or that most noxious of terms, ‘banter’.

Perhaps, as has been said, the number plate was an accident.

But Clarkson’s responses to the matter show he hasn’t grasped why this has caused outrage. He has said via Twitter: ‘These war veterans we upset. Mostly they were in the 20s. Do the maths.’ Thus utterly missing the point. Does he think that only soldiers who have seen service are affected by war? That their families and children just shrug and carry on with their lives, oblivious?

No doubt the Top Gear team will repeat the coincidence claim until the story has faded into the background. No doubt the Christmas special will be an enormous success, its viewing figures boosted by the controversy. No doubt it will go on to sell a huge number of DVDs, and add to the reputed £150 million the show makes for the BBC every year. 

At the end of the world: Undeniably pretty, Ushuaia can lay claim to being the most southerly city on the planet

In happier moments: Normally, Ushuaia is a tourism destination where cruises for Antarctica start and finish

If so, perhaps I could suggest a few more unforeseen coincidences of which the show could be an entirely blameless and wholly unfortunate victim in future episodes.

What about a dash around northern France in cars that – good lord, who could ever have made the connection? – accidentally refer to the 19,240 British men who were slaughtered on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in July 1916?

How about a quick jaunt to the beach at Dunkirk with a number plate that – oh dear, if only we’d spotted it in time – casually mentions the 11,000 Allied soldiers killed in the evacuation of 1940?

What wit. What chutzpah. What bravado. Oh my aching sides.
