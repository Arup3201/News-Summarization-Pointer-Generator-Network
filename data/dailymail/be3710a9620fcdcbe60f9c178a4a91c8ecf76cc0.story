A PR representative for Valentino issued a press release crowing over A-list actress Amy Adams carrying a bag made by the designer label while attending the funeral of Philip Seymour Hoffman.

The Valentino public relations executive Upasna Khosla emailed out a press release that read: 'We are pleased to announce Amy Adams carrying the Valentino Garavani Rockstud Duble bag from the Spring/Summer 2014 collection on Feb. 6 in New York.'

It was accompanied by two pictures of a grieving Adams with her head down, wearing sunglasses and a sombre expression. 

Solemn occasion: Amy Adams, her Valentino bag and her husband Darren Le Gallo attend the wake for Philip Seymour Hoffman in Manhattan Friday

Adams, who recently broke down in tears while speaking to students on Inside the Actors Studio about working with Hoffman, is disgusted by the PR stunt.

The actress' representative called the tasteless ploy 'truly appalling.'

'Amy Adams is not a paid spokesperson for Valentino and the suggestion she would use this moment to participate in a promotion is truly appalling,' the spokesperson told Page Six.

Adams wore a red halterneck Valentino gown to this year's Golden Globes, where she picked up the award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy but it now seems unlikely she'll choose the designer for the upcoming Academy Awards.

Adams, who is nominated in this year's awards for best actress for her role in American Hustle, co-starred with Hoffman in the 2012 Oscar-nominated film The Master, 2008's Doubt and Charlie Wilson's War in 2007.

Hoffman was due to direct Adams in Ezekiel Moss, a period piece, sometime this year.

The company issued an apology for the press release late Friday afternoon.

'We sincerely regret releasing a photo to the media this morning of Amy Adams with a Valentino bag,' said Valentino spokeswoman Mona Swanson.

'We were not aware the photograph was taken while she was attending the wake of Philip Seymour Hoffman. It was an innocent mistake and we apologize to Ms. Adams who was not aware, or a part of, our PR efforts.'

Page Six reports that Valentino wasn't the only fashion company to try to cash in on the celebrity gathering.Page Six reports that Valentino wasn't the only fashion company to try to cash in on the celebrity gathering.

Ugg Australia sent their signature woolly boots to friends of Hoffman, in the hopes they'd be photographed wearing them around New York.

'They did gifting in the hopes that that would happen,' an Ugg associate told Page Six.

'Since they knew a ton of celebs were in New York City and the weather sucks.'
