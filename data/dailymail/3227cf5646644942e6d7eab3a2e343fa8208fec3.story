Cao Huishen types away at rapid speed during a lecture in at a university in Wuhan, China, but unlike the other students in the classroom Cao operates the mouse and keyboard using his feet.

Despite losing his arms in an accident as a child, the inspirational 19-year-old refused to let the tragedy stop him, teaching himself how to write, type and even ride a bike without his arms.

He is now studying computer software engineering at a university in Wuhan, in China's Hubei province.

Cao lost both his arms in an accident 
aged eight involving the electrical mains in his home. His arms were so 
severely burned they had to be amputated.

In an interview with a Chinese newspaper Chutian Jinbao, Cao spoke of his plight to learn how to write again after the accident.

Housebound after the accident his mother told him only children who could write were allowed in school so he began teaching himself how to write with his feet.

‘In
the beginning I struggled with gripping the pen with my toes, and I 
would get foot cramps. But then I thought of a way around it and used a 
piece of string to tie the pen to my toe, and I learned to write again.'

A year later Cao had taught himself to eat, get dressed and ride a bike.

Now
at the Software Engineering Institute in Wuhan he uses his 
toes to type a computer keyboard, and asks his fellow students when he needs help with fetching water or ironing his clothes.

Cao’s father told Chutian Jinbao how the family had struggled since him and his wife both lost their jobs with Cao determined to help the family despite the disability.

During the summer Cao would get up at 6.30am every morning to deliver 
newspapers to pay for his tuition and support his parents, but still 
managed found time to learn how to play guitar.

Cao’s powerful story has made him a regular interviewee on local television and gives motivational lectures in his spare time.

One
of his interviews touched the heart of local businessman Dong Mingzhu, 
who has now paid for his tuition and living costs and has promised him a job when he graduates.

‘People
have to do what they are best at,’ Cao said.

‘I feel my stories can 
give power to many, so I choose to give incentive lectures.’

‘I am not useless, I want to be a good citizen and to ensure I make a real contribution to society.’
