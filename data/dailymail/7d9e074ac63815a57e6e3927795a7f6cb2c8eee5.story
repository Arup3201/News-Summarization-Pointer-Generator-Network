Two masked gunmen have stormed a plush hotel and tied up a member of staff before making off with cash and mobile phones.

Police were called to Dean Street Townhouse in London's trendy Soho district at 3am today after the two men burst in and demanded money.

The raiders threatened staff at the Georgian four-storey hotel and tied one man up, taking cash and mobile phones before fleeing the scene.

No shots were fired and no one was injured but one man was treated for shock.

The hotel in Dean Street is popular with celebrities and Kate Moss, Anne Hathaway and Brian Ferry are all said to have stayed there, while Gwyneth Paltrow cut the ribbon at its opening.

Met Detective Superintendent Jess Ruddell said hotel staff had been left 'very shaken' by the raid and urged witnesses to contact police.

She said: 'This is a very serious incident and we are working around the clock to identify those responsible.'

She added: 'It was a very frightening experience for staff, who were threatened with a long barrelled weapon and were very shaken.

'The suspects are two men who were described as speaking with Eastern European accents and were wearing white hoodies.

'I want to appeal to any witnesses or anyone with information to contact us.'

Dean Street Townhouse is part of the Soho House Group chain, which boasts a string of boutique hotels and private members clubs all over the world, including in New York, Hollywood and Berlin.

The 39-bedroom hotel and restaurant are housed in the building which used to be Gargoyle Club, a drinking den popular with poet Dylan Thomas, playwright Noel Coward and artist Francis Bacon.

The Gargoyle closed its doors in the late 1970s and the buildings were listed Grade II in 1978 before being converted into a hotel and restaurant. 

The hotel declined to comment on the raid this morning but are helping police with their enquiries.
