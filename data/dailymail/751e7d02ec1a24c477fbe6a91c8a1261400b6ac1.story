A salvage diver has died while working on the Costa Concordia wreck after it is believed he cut himself on metal sheeting 10ft underwater and bled to death.

Widely named in Italian and Spanish media as Israel Franco Moreno, from La Coruña, Spain, he was part of a team attaching 30 huge flotation tanks to the side of the 114,500-tonne ship.

He is the first person to die in the salvage operation since the cruise liner hit rocks two years ago off the holiday island of Giglio, Italy.

Tragedy: A salvage diver, named and pictured in Italian media as Israel Franco Moreno from La Coruña, Spain, died after it is believed he cut himself on metal sheeting 10ft underwater and bled to death

The man's Facebook profile included several photos of him at the wreckage, spanning a number of months

Tragedy: A Spanish diver on the stricken Costa Concordia cruise liner (pictured last week) has become the first person to die on what is believed to be the largest maritime salvage operation in history

Danger: The rusting hulk of the ship was hauled upright in the autumn and is being stabilised with 30 giant flotation tanks. But the work is tricky and workers face difficult conditions with huge pieces of equipment

The tragedy happened just days after investigators boarded the ship for the first time since it sank on January 13, 2012, killing 32 people.

According to reports the victim gashed his leg on metal sheeting underwater and was unable to get free, bleeding profusely, until a fellow diver helped him to the surface.

Reports say he was conscious when he surfaced and was airlifted to hospital, but later died.

An investigation is under way after today's incident.

In a statement carried by the Italian ANSA news agency, Titan Micoperi said the diver was working underwater in the area around the wreckage site for the Spanish company UCS (Underwater Contractors Spain).

The head of Italy's civil protection agency, Franco Gabrielli, expressed condolences for the death and recalled the dedication of people working on the wreckage, saying they had worked 'for two years without a break, in difficult conditions not without risks, to achieve the common goal of removing the Concordia from Giglio.'

Italian and Spanish media widely named the victim as Israel Franco Moreno, aged between 40 and 42, from La Coruña in north west Spain. He has not yet been formally named by authorities.

A Facebook page believed to be that belonging to the victim showed several photos of him working on the wreckage and with colleagues.

Rescue: The man was airlifted to hospital but died after his leg may have been trapped, said reports

It appeared he had been working on the
 salvage operation for several months and his captions made several 
references to how cold the water was. On one he wrote: 'Very cold, but 
joyful.'

On another, he wrote: 'Another beautiful sunrise in Giglio'.

Enrico Rossi, president of the Tuscany region, told La Repubblica: 'Another mourning adds to the long list of victims of this vessel, adding pain to pain..

'It also adds rage for another death of a young man who was doing nothing more than his duty.'

It is the first fatality of a worker on the maritime salvage project, believed to be the largest in history and expected to cost £496 million by the time the ship is removed in June.

However, two workers have been injured at the shipyard dealing with the wreck.

In April last year a man fell backwards suffering a head injury and fracturing his collarbone, and a month later a worker was hospitalised while carrying out drilling operations, ANSA reported.

Massive: To be towed this summer the ship will require a little help, from the 902ft Dockside Vanguard. Completed in 2012, it is the largest semi-submersible vessel in the world and can tow more than 100,000 tons

The ship was righted in autumn last 
year as the 'parbuckling' project got under way, with waterlogged 
mattresses and furniture clearly visible through smashed cabin windows.

It will be floated off the sea bed and to port to be scrapped. Among the 12 firms competing for the vast demolition are ABLE Seaton Port on Teeside, near Hartlepool.

The project is expected to cost hundreds of millions more Euros and take 200 people two years to complete.

Workers
 have used more than 1,000 concrete stacks and six underwater platforms 
to keep the liner stable, until it is towed away by the Dutch-built 
902ft Dockwise Vanguard, the largest semi-submersible vessel in the 
world.

Meanwhile the case 
against Captain Francesco Shettino rumbles on. Investigators boarded the
 ship last week - to collect evidence for his defence lawyers.

He
 is on trial accused of multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship, 
facing allegations that he was showboating to onlookers on the holiday 
island before the ship grounded.

Among more lurid claims are that the married captain held 2am trysts in his cabin with the Moldovan dancer Domnica Cemortan.

His trial began in July last year and is expected to last for several months. He denies the charges.

Tragedy: Rescue divers such as the one pictured searched the vessel in September last year, before it was righted, to try and find two bodies on board the ship which were never accounted for
