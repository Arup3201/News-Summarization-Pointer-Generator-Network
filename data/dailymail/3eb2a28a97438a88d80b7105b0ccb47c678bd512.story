NBA officials have taken the next step in scrubbing the stain left by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling’s racist ranting.

The league is working with team management to appoint an interim chief executive officer to guide the franchise through what is expected to be a difficult transition after Sterling was banned for life earlier this week by commissioner Adam Silver.

The move was announced just hours before the Clippers beat the Warriors in Game 7 of their playoff series Saturday night at the Staples Center.

‘The best way to ensure the stability of the team during this difficult situation is to move quickly and install a CEO to oversee the Clippers organization,’ NBA executive vice president of communications Mike Bass said in a statement.

Those involved have already begun the search for the interim executive, he added.

Sterling’s estranged wife and team co-owner Rochelle Sterling appeared to welcome the move, and pledged to work with whoever is involved.

‘I spoke with Commissioner Adam Silver this week to tell him that I fully supported his recent swift and decisive action.

‘We also agreed at that time that, as a next step, both the league and the team should work together to find some fresh, accomplished executive leadership for the Clippers,’ she continued.

‘I welcome his active involvement in the search for a person of the utmost character, proven excellence and a commitment to promoting equality and inclusiveness.’

The CEO will be tasked with running the team while Silver and his legal team try to force Sterling to sell to another owner.

Any sake of the Clippers would require a vote of approval from at least three-fourths of team owners.The NBA's 10-member finance/advisory committee agreed during a Thursday conference call to oust the toxic owner.

No time frame has been agreed upon for how long they believe it should take to find a new owner, and the team itself is not exactly sure how the process will play out, sources told the Los Angeles Daily News.

It is not clear if Sterling plans to fight plans to sell the team in court that would bring an end to his 33-year reign as owner.

He is the longest-tenured team owner in the league.

Clippers coach Doc Rivers deferred to league executives when before Saturday’s big game whether the timing of the announcement would affect his team.

‘We've got to talk about everything else, so let's talk about that, too,’ said Rivers. ‘The NBA has to do their job, they really do.

Rivers is also the team's president of basketball operations, he will report directly to whoever is installed.

The move is not unprecedented. Then-NBA commissioner David Stern appointed an interim CEO to run the New Orleans Hornets during the 2011-12 season after taking the team from former owner George Shinn.

Despite the turmoil off the court, the the Clippers beat the Warriors in Game 7 of their playoff series on Saturday night at the Staples Center

‘They have a lot on their plate as well, and I don't think it's something they can wait on. They're going to do their job.’

Those rumored to be interested include Oprah Winfrey, Magic Johnson, music industry executive David Geffen and more.

The team did its job only hours later when it beat the Golden State Warriors 126-121 to close out an emotional playoff series and advance to the Western Conference semifinals.

Players are moving on to face the vaunted Oklahoma City Thunder and superstar Kevin Durant, but team executives have also moved on.

There is much uncertainty swirling around the Clippers, but winning at least helps drown some of that out for players and fans alike.

All references to Sterling have already been taken from the team’s practice facility built only six years ago at a cost of $60million to their disgraced owner.

Even the ‘Sterling Drive’ sign out front has been taken down.
