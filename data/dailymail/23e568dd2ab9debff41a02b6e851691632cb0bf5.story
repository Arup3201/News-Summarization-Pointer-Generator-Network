Just two British and two American airlines made it onto a list of the most punctual carriers in the world.

New statistics rated airlines based on punctuality and not one major US airline was included, neither were British Airways or Virgin Atlantic.

Budget carriers easyJet and Monarch were the only British carriers in the top 20, along with Hawaiian Airways and Alaska Airways in the US.

airBaltic has been named the best on-time carrier in this new report from aviation data service, OAG

In a report published by OAG, an aviation data service that provides flight schedules worldwide, Europe's airBaltic, Austrian Airlines, Iberia, and Norwegian Air Shuttle all ranked in the top five of all airlines globally for on-time performance. 

Five of the top 20 airlines are in Asia-Pacific and the majority (12) in the list were European.

While German flagship airline Lufthansa made it on to the list, along with Spanish carrier Iberia, Dutch national airline KLM and Finnair, neither British Airways or American Airlines were included at all. 

Of all US-based airlines, only Hawaiian Airlines (pictured) and Alaskan Airlines made it into the top 20

Don't let this happen to you! OAG has released their list of the best airlines for on-time performance rankings

Instead, Latvia's little-known airBaltic snagged the top spot, followed by Hawaiian Airlines and Austrian Airlines.

To compile their rankings, OAG analysed 200 operators globally in terms of available seat miles in 2014 (a measure of airline capacity that accounts for distance travelled) and those that operated more than 30,000 scheduled flights last year.

The rankings take into consideration 'mainline' carriers, as well as low-cost carriers and regional airlines.

However, airlines may wish to counter the claims of OAG, which judges a flight as 'on-time' if it lands within 15 minutes of what is scheduled.
