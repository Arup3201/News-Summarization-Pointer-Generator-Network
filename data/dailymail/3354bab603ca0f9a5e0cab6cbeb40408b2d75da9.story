A happy seal appeared to be having a fit of laughter as it lay on a Norfolk beach in these hilarious images.

The extraordinarily expressive creature was later seen making a facepalm gesture, covering his nose with its flipper, before he gave a furtive glance and a cheeky grin to the camera.

He was snapped among a crowded colony on the North Sea sands at Horsey, in Norfolk by keen amateur wildlife photographer Mark Reeve, 55.

Mr Reeve, of Reydon, near Southwold, Suffolk, said he was able to capture the incredible images after making a 'connection' with the animal who appeared to be in guffaws of laughter as it lay on the beach.

'I just love taking pictures of the seals - they're just such fun creatures,' he said.

'I went up there to see if I could get something different and stand out rather than the same old images of seals on rocks.'

The mental health carer added: 'I managed to get these shots of the big boy within just a couple of seconds.

'I got as close as I could without messing with him and we made a real connection - I'm really happy with the results.' 

It is not the first time Mr Reeve has caught an animal guffawing on film, after his pictures of wild horses appearing to snort with laughter at Reydon Marshes, near the Blyth Estuary, in 2009 received international recognition.
