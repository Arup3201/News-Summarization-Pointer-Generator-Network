It's 50 years since the Jetsons first predicted we'd be flying the family about in airborne cars.

And now we are finally standing on the cusp of that long-awaited milestone, as the world's first flying motorcycle goes on sale.

The Pal-V One Helicycle is a two-seat hybrid car and gyrocopter that has the potential for making rush-hour delays a thing of the past.

The Pal-V One - a three-wheeled motorcyle that transforms into a gyrocopter at the flick of a switch - is now on sale for $295,000 (£180,000). It takes 10 minutes to switch between modes and can go from 0 to 60 in the air in under 8 seconds

Luxury gadgets site Hammacher Schlemmer is marketing the Helicycle for 'just' $395,000 - a bargain...

It is road - and air - legal and now, 
two years after its maiden flight, it is finally available to buy - if 
you have a spare $395,999 (£230,000) that is.

The Dutch-built Pal-V One can reach speeds of up to 112mph and goes from 0 to 60 in under 8 seconds when driven on the road.

The two-seater vehicle converts from a three-wheeled motorcycle to a gyrocopter in 10 minutes.

It has 230hp, four-cylinder engine and reaches speeds of up 112 mph in the air or on the road.

The helicycle goes from 0 to 60 mph in under eight seconds.

The gyrocopter is designed to cruise at low altitudes (below 4,000ft) and it requires a 540ft runway for take-offs. For landing, the vehicle needs just 100 ft.

The 27-gallon gas tank provides a 220-mile flight range (750 miles on the road).

It is made from carbon fiber, titanium, and aluminum and weighs 1,499lbs.

Owners must have a Sports Pilot Certificate to fly the vehicle.

The two-seater vehicle can be bought through luxury gadget retailer Hammacher Schemmler which advertises it under name The Helicycle, yet its design and specifications are identical to the Pal-V One's.

Despite its helicopter-like appearance, like many flying car prototypes, including the TF-X from Austin-based Terrafugia, the Pal-V needs a 540ft runway in order to take-off.

When in flight mode, the vehicle looks like a helicopter, however, it is known as a gyrocopter or autogyro because the main power comes 
from the rotors at the rear of the vehicle.

Its rotors spin considerably slower than a helicopter's blades, too, and can't stall.

On
 the ground, the machine handles somewhere between a motorbike and a 
racing car - its chassis is built to lean into turns, and the two-seater
 can reach speeds of up to 112mph.

Unlike
 most fictional flying cars, of course, it can't just extend its rotors 
then hurtle skywards - the process takes about ten minutes.

Once the engine stops, the propeller folds itself automatically into the driving position. Pushing a button then lowers the rotor mast into the horizontal position.

Rotor blades and tail have to be stowed away by the driver.

'On the ground the vehicle drives like a sports car,' said Pal-V. 'Within minutes its rotor is unfolded and its tail is extended: then it is ready to take off thanks to the advanced gyrocopter technology.'

The gyrocopter, pictured, is designed to cruise at low altitudes, below 4,000ft. Although it needs a 540ft runway for take-off, it only needs 100ft to land

The Pal-V One is on sale from retailer Hammacher Schemmler under the name The Helicycle - but the specifications are the same. It can reach speeds of up to 112 mph and tilts like a motorcycle when turning corners, left.  The helicycle goes from 0 to 60 mph in under eight seconds on the road, as well

'With these successful test results it is proven that it is not only possible to build a flying car but also that it can be done within existing international rules for both flying and driving.'

The Pal-V One features a 230hp, four-cylinder engine powered by petrol.

Its 27 gallon tank means pilots can fly for up to 220 miles at low altitudes - around 4,000ft - or drive for up 750 miles. 

It is made of carbon fiber, titanium, and aluminum and weighs 1,500lbs.

The Pal-V One completed its maiden voyage just 18 months ago. It is available in red, pictured, or black

To drive and fly the Pal-V One, pictured, owners must have a driving license and a Sports Pilot Certificate
