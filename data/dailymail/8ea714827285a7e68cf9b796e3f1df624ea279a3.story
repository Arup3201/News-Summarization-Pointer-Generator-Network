Bernard Jordan said he served on a 
destroyer in the Second World War hunting the ‘wolf packs’ of Nazi 
U-boats attacking Allied shipping convoys.

‘I
 was once on a mission to recover one of the Enigma machines from a 
U-boat which we’d forced to the surface by dropping depth charges, and 
crippling it,’ the 89-year-old Royal Navy veteran told friends.

‘We boarded the submarine and recovered the machine.’

Exactly which ship he was serving on at the time was not clear yesterday, but the 
successful British mission to seize the German code machines and their 
codebooks has been credited with changing the course of the war.

The
 first machine was seized by HMS Bulldog off Iceland in May 1941 when 
U-110 was forced to the surface and a boarding party seized the machine.

In
 another incident a few months later, HMS Petard sent a boarding party 
on board  a U-boat, but two British sailors were drowned when the 
submarine sank.

Hero: Mr Jordan, 89, gets a friendlier reception in Normandy this time from Adele Leatham and Julie Maguire

Drama: The first German code machine was seized by HMS Bulldog off Iceland in May 1941 when U-110 was forced to the surface and a boarding party seized the machine

Captured machines were taken 
to codebreakers at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire where they were 
able to intercept reams of encrypted German signals  for years.

To this day, Mr Jordan, who 
captured the nation's hearts after sneaking out of his care home and 
boarding a coach to France to join in D-Day anniversary events, proudly wears his Atlantic Star medal.
