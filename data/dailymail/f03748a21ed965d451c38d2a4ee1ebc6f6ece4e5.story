Mark and Mary Gundrum of Milwaukee, Wisconsin just celebrated the seven-month birthday of the baby they were told would only live a few hours.

During a routine ultrasound last February, they learned the baby that Mary was carrying had a facial cleft which had allowed brain tissue to seep out and form a golf ball-sized sac on his face.

Baby Dominic Pio was born on June 18 and, beating the odds, began to develop normally. The baby boy is now recovering at home after ground breaking reconstructive surgery to repair his face.

Anxious: The Gundrums were told baby Dominic would only live a few hours after his birth

Walking miracle: The Gundrums are overjoyed at Dominic's recovery

Brothers: Dominic's brother comforts the baby after his surgery

One year ago, the Gundrum's world turned upside down.

The
couple, already parents to seven children, were eager to find out the 
sex of the baby Mary was pregnant with and went for an ultrasound in February 
2012.

With five girls and two boys, they were excited to learn that their new addition would be a boy and they decided they would call their 8th child Dominic.

But their excitement turned to fear when they learned the baby's skull
hadn’t formed properly and there was a triangle-shaped gap from his lip up to
his forehead, called a Tessier midline facial cleft.

With a gap in his head, brain tissue had seeped out and formed a golf
ball-sized sac, called a encephalocele, that was resting near his forehead. 

Complications: A routine ultrasound showed that the child had a massive sac of brain tissue growing on his face

Clinging to hope: After Mary Gundrum learned last Feb. that the condition might be fatal for the child, her other children began praying that Dominic would survive

Doctors prepared the parents that the child would likely not
survive the extremely rare condition, only found in an estimated one child
every two to five years born in the U.S.

It was expected that Mary could carry
the baby to term and that he would be born alive but would likely die within
hours.

'At first we were told he would probably die within a few
hours and that we should do our best to enjoy the pregnancy,' Mark Gundrum said.

'Over time his prognosis got better, and the doctors agreed
he'd survive birth. But after that, they had no idea what may happen to him. It
was a real no man’s land territory for all of us.'

The Gundrums, who are strong 
Catholics, leaned on their faith and spiritual
community as they tried to wrap their heads around what was happening.

They shared
with their seven children that the baby would likely not live and while 
the baby grew in Mary's womb, she wrestled with the tragedy that likely 
lay before her.

Family: The seven Gundrum children have welcomed their baby brother with open arms

Faith: The Gundrums leaned on their faith and the support of their spiritual community

Love: Dominic's older siblings having fun with their younger brother

Digesting the pain, shock and disappointment, Mary poured out her heart about
the emotional roller-coaster ride she experienced in a series of heart
wrenching journal entries, weaving in scripture as she worked through her
emotions.

'My hope is that people will not feel sorry for us, but please join us in
our hopefulness. Please join us in hoping and praying for God's will to be
done in us and Dominic … Of course please pray for us for the grace to trust,'
the then-pregnant mother asked her readers shortly after she learned of the baby's condition.

In the course of the pregnancy, after a discouraging medical appointment, the mother clung to hope and wrote, 'Today
my heart says, yes, I believe in miracles! I believe, if we pray, miracles will
come out of Dominic's short life. I believe God has a miracle in store, what
exactly that will be, I do not need to know.'

With the devastating prognosis, the family waited out the pregnancy and faced an uncertain future.

Then Mary gave birth via C-section on June 18 and Dominic Pio weighed 7 lbs, 8
ounces and measured 20 1/2 inches long.

He
lived longer than a few hours and overwhelmed his parents and the medical 
team as he began developing normally, despite the prominent bubble on 
his face.

Miracle: Dominic Pio stunned doctors with his miraculous survival

Growing: Dominic began developing normally after his birth

Touching: Dominic's big sister snuggles the little miracle

‘Things with Dominic are going so much better than what they could have, we
rejoice at every little victory!’ the family shared with their friends after
Dominic survived the delivery.

In the months following Dominic’s birth, the parents were directed to Dr. John Meara, plastic surgeon-in-chief at
the Boston Children’s Hospital, who advised them to come to Boston so Dominic could undergo facial reconstruction surgery.

Dr Meara and a team of brain specialists worked for weeks to run through
scenarios and prepare for possible complications in the lead to the December operation.

They feared
the blood loss during the procedure would be too much for Dominic’s tiny body in addition to the possibility
of an infection but after weeks of preparation, felt confident at the prospects of a successful outcome.

Joy: The Gundrums said they fell in love with Dominic's face and had to adjust to his new look after his surgery

Then on December 18, a team of 15 doctors gathered in an operating room at
9:30am to remove the brain tissue and fluid that had pooled inside Dominic’s
encephalocele.

With the sac removed from his face, Dr Meara then performed
reconstructive surgery on the baby’s face to repair the clef and align the
skull.

The procedure ended at 3:30pm. The surgery ended up going more smoothly than expected and Dominic spent the next three weeks in ICU recovering. 

'Everything went according to plan thanks to the amazing efforts of the whole team,' Dr Meara said.

The Gundrums said they owe so much to the efforts Dr Meara, who was optimistic about Dominic's condition when no one else was.

'This doctor believed in Dominic's life as being valuable and worth all that went into saving him,' Mary wrote in thanks. 

'This doctor made it possible for us to come out for a second opinion 
and then he made it possible with insurance for Dominic's surgery to be 
covered.'

With his condition stabilized after three weeks, the parents returned to Wisconsin.

As the family and their church continue to pray, they are thanking God for the miracle that is unfolding in Dominic.

'The day Dominic was born, a group of friends had a tree planted in our yard in his honor,' Mark said.

'I remember thinking, 10 years from now, I’m either going to look at that tree and think of the son I lost, or watch him climb its branches. Right now, thanks to so many wonderful people at Boston Children’s and beyond, I'm excited to watch him hanging from that tree as they both grow bigger and stronger.'
