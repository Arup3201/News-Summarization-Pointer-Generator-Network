Jennifer Lopez missed out on performing at the IPL opening ceremony after her camp demanded her own plane

Jennifer Lopez was dropped from performing in front of tens of millions of viewers at the Indian Premier League opening ceremony after her camp demanded she have her own plane.

Her manager Benny Medina reportedly asked organisers to make a private plane available to the superstar and pay for hotel rooms for her extensive entourage, including stylists and a personal chef.

Sources told NY Post that the Pepsi IPL booked rapper Pitbull after refusing to meet her diva-like demands.

It quoted a source who said the list of demands was 'outrageous'.

The source told NY Post: 'She effectively priced herself out of the
event. It was an idiotic move because the audience for this event is 
huge. It’s like the Super Bowl halftime show.'

Last year Katy Perry, dressed in a Bollywood-inspired costume, performed at the extravagant opening ceremony watched by 56 million people. 

A J-Lo representative denied she was dropped by IPL organisers and said she is not performing at the ceremony on Tuesday because she is too busy.

The aide told the NY Post: 'An offer was made to perform; the date conflicted with Jennifer’s
current music-recording schedule for an album due this summer.'

The singer and actress has repeatedly been forced to deny she is a diva.

Lopez, pictured on American Idol, has been repeatedly forced to deny reports of being a diva

Last year she said: 'I think people love to look at them (riders) and go, “Oh my God she wants M&M'S ... she's crazy!

'I think everyone has their list of things that make you feel comfortable ... like a certain kind of potato chip or water. I think the crazy ones are made up.’

In 2010, Lopez was rumoured to putting her American Idol deal in jeopardy because of her 'unreasonable demands'.

U.S.
media reported that she asked for more than $20million a year, plus a 
personal hair, make-up and styling team and her own 'dressing room 
compound'.

The 'Jenny From The Block' singer was also forced to admit that an advert showing her driving around the gritty streets of The Bronx, where she grew up, was in fact shot in Los Angeles.

Instead
of travelling to her old neighbourhood to shoot the driving scenes, for the 'My World' Fiat adverts, the
songstress used a body double.

In the advert, Lopez tells prospective Fiat buyers, 'This is my world.

'This place inspires me to be tougher, to stay sharper, to think faster.

She then adds, 'They may be just streets to you, but to me, they’re a playground.'

Lopez also reportedly asked for nine dressing rooms for her 90-strong entourage ahead of an interview with the BBC.

The NY Post reported that before filming a video for African AIDS victims, the asked for a 45ft trailer, white lilies, yellow roses with a red trim and apple pie.
