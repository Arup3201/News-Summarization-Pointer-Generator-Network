Residents of the small Iraqi town of Amerli took to the streets in celebration today after local security forces backed by U.S. airstrikes broke a two-month siege by ISIS militants.

About 150,000 Shiite Turkmen have been stranded in the town with dwindling water and supplies since June - but this morning aid finally begun flowing to the area and life slowly returned to normal.

The siege was lifted after the U.S. air force carried 
out limited strikes in the area for the first time, and ground forces backed by Iran-allied Shiite militias forced the ihadists to withdraw.

The news comes as ISIS faces growing resistance in Iraq - with Kurdish peshmerga troops also forcing militants to abandon a number of areas around the city of Tikrit this morning.

al-Sistsani, ordering promotions and awards for forces who took part in 
ending the siege.

'I
 salute you for your steadfastness and patience against those beasts and
 killers,' he told a gathering of fighters in the large hall, as they 
chanted Shiite religious slogans.

Ali 
al-Bayati, who heads the local Turkmen Saving Foundation, said four 
trucks loaded with food, medicine and fruit entered the town of Amirli 
this morning after militants fled the area.

The
 aid was sent by the Iraqi government and the Iraqi Red Crescent, he 
said, adding that soldiers first started bringing food to families in 
their houses last night.

'The situation is getting back to normal, but gradually,' al-Bayati said.

'Some people have come out from their houses and walk in the street. 
Shops are still closed, but people are happy to see their city secured 
by Iraqi security forces,' he added.

Since early 
this year, Iraq has faced a growing Sunni insurgency led by the 
al-Qaida-breakaway group ISIS, who along with their allies have taken 
control of territory in the country's north and west.

The crisis is Iraq's worst since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops.

Elsewhere in Iraq, Kurdish peshmerga forces were pictured celebrating as they took control of Sulaiman Pek from ISIS militants in the northwest of Tikrit.

Iraq's human rights minister, Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani today said Islamist fighters have carried out 
atrocities on 'an unimaginable scale' since the fighting began.

Speaking at an emergency debate on this conflict, the UN official added that ISIS militants 'oozing 
with barbarity' posed a serious threat to both his country and the wider world.

At least 1,420 people were killed in Iraq in August alone, U.N. figures showed today.  

Returning to normal: A young Yazidi girl carries water in the Iraqi town of Lalesh. Having recently fled Mount Sinjar after persecution from ISIS militants, the Yazidis are now taking shelter at a local holy temple

Defence: Gun-wielding Yazidi men stand outside their temporary home in Lalesh. The town's usual population consists of a small number of maintenance workers for the holy shrine but has now expanded to include 400 Yazidi families displaced by ISIS militants

Sanctuary: A elderly Yazidi man prays at the door of the holy temple in Lalesh

Displaced: Yazidi refugees take shelter in an unfinished building in Dohuk. Thousands of Yazidis have been forced to leave their homes since ISIS militants began massacring them in Syria and Iraq

The one-day session, called by Iraq with 
the support of allies including the United States, is expected to agree 
to Baghdad's request to send UN experts to investigate crimes committed 
in the conflict.

There is 
'strong evidence' ISIS and allied groups have carried out targeted 
killings, forced conversions, sexual abuse and torture in Iraq, U.N. 
Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Flavia Pansieri said, opening 
the debate in Geneva.

'The
 reports we have received reveal acts of inhumanity on an unimaginable 
scale,' she told the U.N. Human Rights Council, on its first meeting 
about the latest surge in violence.

Iraqi government forces and police had also committed acts that may amount to war crimes, Pansieri said.

'Systematic
 and intentional attacks on civilians may constitute war crimes and 
crimes against humanity. Individuals, including commanders, are 
responsible for these acts,' Pansieri said, referring to crimes 
committed by both sides.
