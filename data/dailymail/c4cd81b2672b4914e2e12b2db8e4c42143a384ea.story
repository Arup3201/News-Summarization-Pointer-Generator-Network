The Prime Minister has refused to boycott this week’s controversial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm) in Sri Lanka, despite a second major nation pulling out in protest over human rights issues.

According to Foreign Secretary William Hague, Britain believes it can have ‘more impact’ by engaging in face-to-face talks with the country’s president, who has been accused of persecuting the country’s Tamil minority and political opponents.

Yesterday Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh announced he was pulling out of the bi-annual summit, which is being opened on Friday by Prince Charles on behalf of the Queen, who is head of the 54-strong ‘Family of Nations’.

Last month Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, said he would boycott the meeting over the Sir Lanka’s alleged abuse of human rights, as well as cut off funding to the Commonwealth itself over its decision to host the meeting there.

In an interview yesterday, Foreign Secretary William Hague said the government ‘understood’ why the Indian leader had chosen not to attend the three-day meeting.

But he insisted Britain would have ‘more impact’ by directly raising concerns in the country and rejected calls by Labour to join the boycott.

He also revealed that Mr Cameron would not only be meeting with the Indian President on Thursday to discuss the on-going Sri Lankan issue, but would be the first head of government since the island won independence from the UK in 1948 to visit the Tamil north during his stay.

Mr Hague said: 'We do understand [the boycott] that but we are not joining that.

‘The Indian foreign minister will be attending so, in the case of some of these countries, although their prime ministers are not going, other ministers are.

‘We have decided that if we were to stay away... it would damage the Commonwealth without changing things positively in Sri Lanka.

‘Sri Lanka is in the spotlight so let’s make full use of it being in the spotlight. Rather than sit in London and talk about it, we will be there.’

He added: ‘The Prime Minister will be the first head of government from any country since Sri Lankan independence in 1948 to go to the north.

‘I will be visiting places to promote reconciliation in Sri Lanka, talking about our efforts there to prevent sexual violence in conflict.

‘It will make more impact in Sri Lanka with the Prime Minister and me there doing that, than sitting in our offices in London.’ 

UN high commissioner for human rights Navi Pillay has warned that Sri Lanka - considered a ‘country of concern’ by the Foreign Office - is heading in an ‘increasingly authoritarian direction’.

The Sri Lankan government, particularly its President Mahinda Rajapaksa, denies allegations that it has been complicit in kidnappings, torture and other abuses amid mounting concerns over disappearances of political opponents and attacks on the judiciary and press.

It has also been accused of a sickening 
catalogue of war crimes again the Tamils, including the apparently 
indiscriminate shelling of areas - including hospitals - packed with 
civilians, extrajudicial executions and rapes by soldiers during a 
bitter quarter-century civil war.

Western nations have long been pressing Sri Lanka to account for thousands of civilians who are suspected to have died in the final months of the conflict, which ended in 2009 when government forces crushed resistance by Tamil rebels who were fighting for an ethnic homeland.

Labour, rights activists and Tamil groups have called again on the Prime Minister to join the boycott of this week’s three-day conference.

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: ‘David Cameron must now urgently consider reversing his decision to attend the summit in Sri Lanka this week.

‘For months Labour has urged the Government to do more to raise Britain’s concern over human rights in Sri Lanka in the run up to the summit.

‘If the Prime Minister now chose to reverse his decision to attend the summit - even at this late stage - he would have Labour’s full support.’

He added: ‘The Government’s policy has descended into confusion ‘If the Prime Minister is still refusing to consider downgrading the British delegation, despite reports to the contrary, he must now explain this decision given other Commonwealth leaders are prepared to take a different approach.’

Downing Street said it recognised attendance posed a ‘difficult’ choice for some countries but that it was up to each to determine its own approach.

Mr Cameron has vowed to personally push the Sri Lankan president to hold an independent investigation into the claims on human rights abuses, including the disappearances of tens of thousands of opponents.

‘I will raise my concerns when I see President Rajapaksa next week in Colombo,” he said.

‘And I will tell him that if Sri Lanka doesn’t deliver an independent investigation, the world will need to ensure an international investigation is carried out instead.’ ends
