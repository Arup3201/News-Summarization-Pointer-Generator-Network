There are few people around that would think of putting a snake in their mouth, particularly one that is wrapped around a tarantula. 

But this is exactly what Arteval Duarte, a man nicknamed the 'Ninja of Serpents' has done while a friend captures his actions on video.

Quite why he is so keen to put a snake and spider in his mouth is not clear - and it's not for the faint-hearted - but what a man's gotta do...

The bizarre video emerged from Brazil and the footage was captured in the city of Pará earlier this year.

Brazilan Duarte, nicknamed the ‘Ninja of Serpents’, is seen handling a banded cat-eyed snake and a pinktoe tarantula before wrapping the snake around the spider and placing them both in his mouth.

And look away...NOW! The furry legs of the tarantual wave around inside the man's mouth

He then holds the creatures in his mouth for a few seconds until they gradually fall out.

Duarte says he has been charming and training poisonous animals for more than 15 years.

According to Duartes a sting from the pinktoe tarantula is not lethal but could cause dermatitis or necrosis.

Don't pick me! Duarte begins the process of handling the snake while the tarantula watches

Your turn now: The man dubbed the Ninja of snakes handles the tarantual gently

And in we go.... Duarte pops the wrap into his mouth. Why? Well only he knows the answer to that

Gross out: The spider and snake writhe about in his mouth before gradually falling out

No wonder he wraps it up so carefully inside the snake. Pinktoes don't get as large as your common or garden tarantual, with a leg span of around five inches.

Tarantulas are often feature in horro movies, which has given these big, furry spiders an undeserved bad rap.

They strike fear in the hearts of arachnophobes everywhere, but in truth, tarantulas are some of the least aggressive and dangerous spiders around.

Still, don't try this at home kids.
