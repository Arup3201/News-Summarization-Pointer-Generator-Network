Nokia fans, look away now.

If you were upset by the news that the Nokia branding was to be dropped from all future Microsoft phones, then you won’t want to see these new images.

Microsoft has now unveiled what its phones will look like once the branding switch to ‘Microsoft Lumia’ is complete, bringing to an end nearly three decades of Nokia phones.

Dry your eyes mate: Microsoft has revealed what its phones will look like now that the Nokia brand name has been dropped from all future devices, shown in this image. From now on all Nokia Lumia and Windows Phone devices will simply be called Microsoft Lumia, although existing phones will continue to be supported

Earlier this week it was reported that Microsoft was to drop both the Nokia and Windows Phone brand names in favour of just using Lumia. 

The company is beginning a transition to change all of its branding to simply Microsoft Lumia, just in time for the holiday season.

From now on, Microsoft devices will carry the company's name in the place where the word 'Nokia' used to appear.  

The change was first confirmed by Nokia France on their Facebook page on Tuesday when they wrote: ‘We are on the verge of becoming Microsoft Lumia!’

The move brings an end to Nokia’s name being on mobile phones, a long run that stretches back into the 1980s.

It was first hinted at when Microsoft moved Nokia.com to be hosted on Microsoft’s own site.

Each country will gradually see branding changed from Nokia to Microsoft Lumia across various social media accounts, beginning with Nokia France.

Microsoft bought Nokia’s phone business in April in a £4.5 billion ($7.2 billion) deal.  

Nokia phones will likely elicit fond memories for many, with the Nokia 3310 in particular being one of the defining phones at the dawn of the cell phone age.

First released towards the end of 2000, the phone went on to sell 126 million units world wide and continues to enjoy a cult status. 

And now in a post on Microsoft’s Conversations blog, Senior Vice President of Marketing for Phones at Microsoft Tuula Rytilä has unveiled the changes.

‘This is a very exciting time for us and for Lumia products,’ she said.

‘You might have seen that in the last couple of months, we have already made some name changes to our apps to better reflect that these apps now come from Microsoft.

‘Our global and local websites are going through a transition as we speak and in the coming days our social channels will get a new name too - they will be called Microsoft Lumia.

‘We would like to invite our Lumia fans to continue to follow us and always be up to speed with the latest device news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.’

She would wouldn’t give a specific date, she said the first Microsoft Lumia device would be released revealed ‘soon’.

She added: ‘This is of course a natural progression as all devices that once came from Nokia now come from Microsoft.’

From now on, Microsoft devices will carry the company's name in the place where the word 'Nokia' used to appear, as shown in this image posted on Microsoft's Conversations blog

She was quick to add that this did not make Nokia Lumia smartphones currently on the market obsolete.

‘Microsoft continues to sell and support the Nokia Lumia phones that are out in the market, such as the recently announced Lumia 830 and Lumia 730/735,' she said.

‘We will continue to honor customer warranties and provide world-class care services as before.’

And it’s not entirely the death of Nokia; Ms Rytilä says some entry-level Nokia-branded phones, such as the Nokia 130, will still be sold, as Microsoft still has a 10-year license on the Nokia brand.

According to The Verge, Microsoft only had 18 months to use the Nokia brand on smartphones, but can use it longer on regular phones.

Microsoft also revealed yesterday that, in the most recent quarter, the company had seen a small increase in the 8.8 million Windows Phones sold last year to 9.3 million this year.

The change by the Washington firm will see all Microsoft smartphones simply called Microsoft Lumia from now on (Lumia 730 shown). Both the Nokia brand name and Windows Phone are being dropped in the shake-up of Microsoft's phone business. On the middle phone you can see where the word 'Nokia' used to appear

The change was first reported by The Verge on Monday and was confirmed by Nokia France on their Facebook page on Tuesday.

They wrote: 'In the coming days, you will receive a Facebook message regarding the change of name of this page.

'Some of today’s press reports related to rumours about Microsoft dropping the Nokia brand have declared the death of the Nokia brand,' said Barry French, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Corporate Affairs.

'But, to paraphrase Mark Twain, “reports of our death are an exaggeration.”

'Yes, we have sold our mobile phone business to Microsoft. But the Nokia of today is financially robust and has moved from weakness to strength.

'We have one of the world’s best telecom infrastructure businesses, a global leader in the mapping and location business, a stellar intellectual property portfolio and some of the finest innovation capabilities of any company anywhere.

'Remember, Nokia started almost 150 years ago with just one paper mill. Over time we have repeatedly and successfully reinvented ourselves.

'We may not be the same Nokia of several years ago, but we are here, we are strong, and our brand is very much still alive. Not to mention kicking!'

'We are on the verge of becoming "Microsoft Lumia!"

'Stay-tuned for more soon.'

The move brings an end to Nokia’s name being on mobile phones, a long run that stretches back into the 1980s.

It was first hinted at when Microsoft moved Nokia.com to be hosted on Microsoft’s own site.

Nokia has been quick to assure customers that the company will live on, albeit no longer in the mobile phone business.

In a blog post back in September Barry French, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Corporate Affairs at Nokia said: ‘To paraphrase Mark Twain, “reports of our death are an exaggeration.”

‘Yes, we have sold our mobile phone business to Microsoft. But the Nokia of today is financially robust and has moved from weakness to strength.

‘We have one of the world’s best telecom infrastructure businesses, a global leader in the mapping and location business, a stellar intellectual property portfolio and some of the finest innovation capabilities of any company anywhere.’

The move brings to an end nearly three decades of Nokia phones, which will likely elicit fond memories for many, with the Nokia 3310 (shown) in particular being one of the defining phones at the dawn of the cell phone age upon its release in 2000
