A retired scientist was killed on a cruise ship when he was struck on the head by a window frame that was broken by a freak wave in the English Channel, an inquest has heard.

James Swinstead, 85, died 'almost instantly' on board the British vessel Marco Polo as it was battered by waves during severe storms on Valentine's Day last year.

His wife of 58 years, Helen, was dining with her husband when water crashed through a window, injuring him and a number of the 735 passengers on board the 22,000-tonne vessel.

Tragedy: James Swinstead, 85, and his wife of 58 years, Helen, were dining on board the British vessel Marco Polo, when a freak wave hit the cruise ship, breaking a window which hit Mr Swinstead  

The ship, operated by Cruise and Maritime Voyages, was heading for its home port of Tilbury in Essex at the end of a 42-night voyage when the storm hit.

The Marco Polo was carrying 735 passengers, most of them British, at the time of the incident.

Mr Akhurst told the hearing that 16 passengers and crew members were injured. A female passenger in her 70s was airlifted off the ship. Many of the injured suffered cuts from flying glass.

Essex Coroner's Court heard that the grandfather-of-three and his wife Helen were sitting at a restaurant table next to a window when the wave hit.

Questions unanswered: Helen Swinstead said the inquest did not provide full closure

Two windows were smashed and two others were dislodged but did not shatter.

Forensic pathologist Dr David Rouse told the inquest that Mr Swinstead suffered a fractured skull and extensive brain damage.

His report found that the death was 'consistent with an impact by or against a heavy object such as a window frame'.

He said Mr Swinstead, of Colchester, suffered injuries usually seen in victims of car accidents, and that he was 'effectively dead' after the blow to the head.

John Akhurst, deputy director for the Bahamas Maritime Authority, which carried out an investigation following the incident, said: 'There was a great deal of violence and force involved in what happened as the windows were smashed and dislodged.'

He went on: 'We could not say with any confidence that there was anything to be alarmed with about the condition of those windows.'

He said the ship was hit by a 'significantly large wave' amid 'phenomenal' sea conditions caused by a storm which had come across from the west sooner than expected.

Mr Akhurst said the ship's assessment of weather forecasts was 'competent'.

But, following his recommendation, the vessel now uses a more accurate bespoke weather forecasting service.

He also found that the Marco Polo's safety management structure should be reviewed.

But speaking after the hearing, Mrs Swinstead said she had noticed the window was rusting.

When asked if the inquest had given her the answers she was looking for, she replied: 'No, not really, because why were we shown to the table by the window? 

'There were rusty puddles on the windowsill. That's with hindsight. We sat there because it was a lovely view of a rough sea.'

Mrs Swinstead claims the windows on Marco Polo were rusting and that there were rusty puddles on the windowsill by the table where her husband was hit

Her solicitor, Martyn Carr, said: 'I don't think there is any doubt when you look at the photographs those windows look, quite frankly, a bit dodgy.

'Perhaps the strength of the waves was extremely unusual, but you don't expect to be sitting in a restaurant and have the window come in on you.

'There are questions still to be answered about the strength of the windows.'

Caroline Beasley-Murray, Senior Coroner for Essex, said: 'In light of all the evidence that has been heard before this court I shall record a conclusion on the record of inquest - that is answering how he died - that James Malcolm Swinstead died as a result of an accident, a tragic accident.

'He clearly was a much-loved gentleman.'

Addressing Mrs Swinstead directly, she added: 'You have had the ordeal of sitting through this inquest this afternoon and you have done that with the utmost dignity.'
