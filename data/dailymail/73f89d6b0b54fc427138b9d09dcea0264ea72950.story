A suspected sex offender who disappeared from his home with a gun has shot himself dead, police confirmed today.

The body of Garry Foster was found at 2.15pm in the area of Claines, Worcester, following a call from a member of the public.

Officers say it is thought the father-of-two committed suicide with a shotgun which has been recovered from the scene.

His
body was found 28 miles away from his home in Dudley, West Midlands 
after he went missing four days ago not long after he was quizzed by 
police over sex offence allegations.

West
Midlands Police Superintendent Andy Parsons said: 'Our aim was always 
to find Mr Foster. Unfortunately our searches appear to have come to a 
tragic end.

'We continue to support the family with specially trained officers.'

The
53-year-old was last seen driving his blue-silver Mitsubishi Pajero in 
Worcestershire at 3.26pm on Sunday and West Midlands Police had grown 
increasingly concerned about his welfare after he left his house in a 
'stressed, emotional state' and was believed to have had a legally-held
12-bore pump-action shotgun in his possession.

About 75 officers, including armed 
police, had searched for Mr Foster, who regularly spent days 
using his survival skills to camp in the remote countryside.

He
had connections in Shropshire, Herefordshire and Staffordshire and was a
registered firearms licence holder.

West
Midlands Police confirmed they had begun a separate investigation into 
the sexual offences allegations made by people known to Foster, of The 
Priory.

West Midlands 
Police Superintendent Parsons said: 'Garry disappeared after allegations
of a serious sexual nature were made against him by people known to him
- they are part of a separate investigation by West Midlands Police.

Mr Foster was believed to be using his Mitsubishi Pajero, which is blue and silver in colour with distinctive yellow fog lights. Police had released an image of the car in a bid to trace Mr Foster.
