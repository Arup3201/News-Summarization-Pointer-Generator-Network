A college student who was abused by her biological parents has now found a surrogate mother for the holidays after posting a Craigslist ad.

Jackie Turner, 26, posted an ad on the online marketplace 'looking to rent a mom and dad who can give me attention and make me feel like the light of their life just for a couple of days because I really need it'.

The response she received was overwhelming and she was flooded with letters from both prospective parents and other children who felt neglected and in need of some caring attention.

Happy outcome: Jackie Turner has paired up with Anita Hermsmeier who works in student services at her school, William Jessup University

Looking for some love: Jackie received letters from dozens of would-be parents and other students who wanted similar experiences with caring adult mentors

Now she was not only able to find a match for herself but also one for six other students.

'This time of year is hard. Everyone is talking about their cousins, their families, all the things that make up Christmas,' Jackie told CBS News.

Jackie got paired up with Anita Hermsmeier, a woman who works in student services at Jackie's college, William Jessup University.

'I've found my mentor!' Jackie said when she and Ms Hermsmeier hugged at the mixer she arranged for the students and parents looking for love.

'People are hurting and broken and we need each other! We need to be loving people,' she said.

Adding to the success, none of the would-be 'parents' asked for the $8-per-hour that Jackie offered to pay for their uninterrupted attention.

Changing from her past: Jackie, 26, posted an ad on Craigslist seeking to rent a family for the holidays at $8 an hour. She has since received dozens of responses from people willing to take her in for free

Looking at the jovial, straight-A student from William Jessup University, it is hard to imagine the strife she had seen in her 26 years.

‘I've never felt the touch of my Mom hugging me and holding me,’ she told News10.’ I don't know what it's like to look in my dad's eyes and feel love instead of hatred.’

Jackie had been physically, sexually and emotionally abused since she was a little girl.

To escape the violence at home, she spent years living on the streets where she had picked up a drug habit and found herself in a gang.

Jackie was eventually arrested for grand theft and served nearly a year behind bars - an outcome that marked a turning point in her life.    

Upon her release in 2010, Jackie decided to go to a religious camp for troubled teens called Christian Encounter Ministries.

Three years later, she is now a presidential scholar at William Jessup boasting a 4.0 GPA. She also plays soccer on the school team.

Despite her successes, Jackie says she still has a deep void inside her that she feels only a family could fill – even if it's only a rented one.

‘My biological parents aren't here, and it's kept this hole inside of me,’ Jackie said.

So Turner came up with the idea to lease a family for the holiday season so she could have someone who would listen to her and cry with her - no strings attached.

Jackie's bold decision to go public with her pain and longing for a family also struck a chord with other people who had suffered abuse.

The college student has been receiving emails from men and women openly discussing their childhood traumas.

‘People are out there with the same heart inside of them,’ she said. ‘Some of them with a greater drive then mine.’
