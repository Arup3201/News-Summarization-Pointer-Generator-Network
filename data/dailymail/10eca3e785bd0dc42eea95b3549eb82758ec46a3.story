A photographer has created a portfolio of incredibly surreal images using a combination of raw materials, original photography and Adobe Photoshop alterations.

Erik Johansson, originally from Sweden, claims to capture 'ideas' in his work. Whether using photographs and digital editing, or even paint and hand made cardboard models to re-create an imagined vision, his completed images look as though they are perfectly genuine photographs.

In fact, every new image is a combination of hundreds of original photographs, sometimes with raw materials created by Mr Johansson himself, and dozens of hours spent in Adobe Photoshop to digitally alter and combine different elements to illustrate his idea.

Mr Johansson writes on his websiteÂ that he uses photography as a means of 'collecting material to realise the ideas in my mind'.

First the image is sketched as a basic idea. He then plans what is required to create the landscape and starts identifying locations to photograph. These serve as the basis for the photo, or what he calls the 'raw material'.

Any additional materials needed, such as the cardboard model and paints required for Landfall are also photographed.

The final part is putting the photos together. This can take him anywhere from a few days to several weeks and he describes it as the easiest step - like putting together the pieces of a puzzle.
