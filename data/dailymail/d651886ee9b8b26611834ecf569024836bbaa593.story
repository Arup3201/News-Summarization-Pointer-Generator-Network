Police have found the body of a 26-year-old man who was grabbed by a crocodile in front of his horrified friends while swimming in a river at a 30th birthday party in Australia's tropical northern region.

IT worker Sean ColeÂ and a friend had gone for a 'celebration swim' in the Mary River, 60 miles east of Darwin when he was grabbed by a huge croc - estimated to be 16ft long.

Police and park rangers found Mr Cole's body in the muddy river - notorious for its saltwater crocodile population - early today in an area not far from where he was last seen.

IT worker Sean Cole had gone for a swim in the Mary River, 60 miles east of Darwin during a 30th birthday party when he was grabbed by a huge croc - estimated to be 16ft long.

Police Commander Geoff Bahnert said 
up to 15 others attending the birthday party at a caravan park near the 
river remained traumatised today after watching the crocodile swimming 
upriver with Mr Cole in its jaws on Saturday afternoon.

'I would never ever go in that water,' said Commander Bahnert. 'Why that young man did, I don't know.'

A friend who was with Mr Cole staggered ashore crying out that there had been a crocodile attack.

'He
realised that it could have been him,' said a local man. 'It would have
seen two of them swimming and just went for them and the fellow that 
got taken was the unlucky one.'

Close
friend Glen Spearing, from the University Rats Football Club, said 
today that it was out of character for Mr Cole to go swimming in a river
known to be infested with crocodiles.

'I
think myself, along with everyone else, when we found out we honestly 
didn't believe that it would have been Sean,' said Mr Spearing.

'We would have expected it to be almost anyone else in the club but Sean. It just seemed extremely out of character for him.'

Another
friend, Miss Frida Pettersson, who was camping near the place where the
attack happened, said Mr Cole's horrifying death served as a warning 
about the dangers of swimming in such areas.

'It
was my first time there and obviously I'm never going to forget it - 
and for my children,' she told Australia's ABC tV network.

'It's just another wake-up call about water safety and to be aware of the water.'

Infested: The calm waters hide the hundreds of crocodile living in the Mary River

Anyone
swimming in the Mary River could expect, with 100 per cent certainty, 
to be taken by a saltwater crocodile, said Northern Territory crocodile 
expert Dr Grahame Webb.

'People who swim there sort of know they shouldn't but they let their guard down,' he said.'They're having fun and do something they wouldn't normally do and in that particular location it's a pretty tragic situation.'

Mr
Shaun Kelly, who manages a small hotel in the area, said people who had
gone for a swim in the Mary River in the past and got away with it, 
might return and then lose their lives in the jaws of a crocodile.

During
the hunt for Mr Cole's body, police and park rangers shot four 
crocodiles hoping to find the rogue beast that grabbed the young man.

'Any
animals that wee in that range which we believed to be a possible 
target in the area where the accident took place, we usual take them out
for simple reasons,' said Parks and Wildlife Ranger Tom Nichols.

'We do autopsies on those and it's also closure for the families if there's anything in there (in their stomachs).'
