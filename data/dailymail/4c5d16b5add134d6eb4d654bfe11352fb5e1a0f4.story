The pop star girlfriend of Arsenal star Mesut Ozil has moved out of their home amid claims he flirted with a teammate's lover, according to reports.

Singer Mandy Capristo had been living with the £42million player in west London and is a judge on the X Factor-style reality show 'Germany's Search for a Superstar'.

However, last week, the World Cup winner was accused of 'muscling in' on the relationship of German teammate Christian Lell and his former girlfriend Melanie Rickinger.

Pictures emerged today showing workers hauling boxes into a German moving van outside Ozil's London home.

It has been reported that Ozil exchanged intimate messages with the model on the messaging service WhatsApp.

Both Ozil and Miss Capristo have refused to comment on the allegations.

However, according to The Sun, the singer's belongings were seen being taken into a removal van and she has reportedly told friends her relationship with the 26-year-old is over after being left devastated. 

The newspaper quotes a friend as saying: 'Mandy had a break from filming so came back to London to get her stuff.'

The allegations first came to light last week when Lell, who plays for Levante in Spain, gave an interview with German newspaper Bild and explained his ex Miss Rickinger had exchanged messages with Ozil and described her as a 'snake'.

The newspaper quotes Mr Lell as saying: 'Mesut exploited his fame, and muscled in on our relationship. That isn't OK'.

She said: 'You'd never say to the partner of a tennis player that they're only this or that, that's a lack of respect.

'So when people say I'm just a WAG, I don't care. I have too much respect for myself and my own work to even bother thinking about these people.'

MailOnline has contacted Ozil's publicist for comment.
