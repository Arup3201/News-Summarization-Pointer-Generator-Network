The Milky Way, the Northern Lights and raging night storms illuminate the night sky in America's Midwest in this stunning timelapse video captured by South Dakota photographer and videographer Randy Halverson.

The ever-changing canopy of clouds and constellations provides an ethereal backdrop to otherwise everyday scenes of fields, farms and tranquil lakes.

One lake is bathed in a green, eerie glow while in another shot, the stars appear to spin in the sky behind silhouetted trees.

Halverson captured the footage in some of the most isolated regions of the States, including South Dakota, Wyoming and Utah, between spring and autumn 2013.

The 47-year-old spent 40 nights across eight-months using a wide-angle lens and long exposures to obtain the crystal-clear footage. 

Randy, from Kennebec, South Dakota, started up a stock footage company selling pictures of storms in the 1990s but decided to started shooting timelapse videos four years ago.

‘I just decided I was looking for something a little bit different other than storms so that’s how I got into the long exposure timelapse', he explains.

The dedicated videographer battled with cloudy weather conditions to achieve the amazing footage of the dramatic Midwestern night sky.

He said: 'I use DSLR [digital single-lens reflex] cameras to shoot long exposure timelapse at night with up to 30-seconds per frame.

'I then assembled the individual frames into the timelapse on my computer. I spent a lot of time with the hue settings and white balance during the month-and-a-half edit.

'The weather in 2013 made it difficult for me to get some of the shots I wanted. There were many times I planned to shoot the Milky Way or Aurora, and the clouds would roll in.'

Randy, who also owns a farm in South Dakota, takes hundreds of still photos over several hours and then ‘stitches’ them together to create amazing sequences.

'At a normal rate you don’t notice how the Earth is rotating and it looks like the stars are moving across the sky. 

'It just speeds up everything so much more than you’re used to seeing', he said.

Halverson said he got some of his best shots of the Milky Way in Wyoming but he was often hampered by cloud.

He also captured several satellites and a couple of meteors in the shots: ‘The meteors are hard to see in time-lapse, but you may see a quick flash because they only last one frame. If you see a light moving across the sky, it is either an airplane or satellite, not a meteor.’

And he explained that capturing the stunning red or green glow of the Aurora was often not planned: 'Some of the Aurora I shot were unexpected with no advanced notice. Several nights I was setting up Milky Way shots, when I noticed the glow in the sky to the north.'

Perfect timing: Randy said there were many times when it was difficult for him to get the shot he wanted but here he captures the night sky in all its glory

Most of Randy's footage is shot at night and, if you can see stars and it looks like the sun setting or rising, it is actually the moon: 'It will light up the landscape just like the sun with long exposures', he explains.

He used a dolly, a 6ft metal rail, that is set up to move the camera smoothly in time with the sky and gives it what Halverson calls the ‘walking through it look’.

Randy says: 'People love my pictures - some even say they are blown away. 

'I do get the occasional comment from someone who thinks it is fake and it is a Hubble spaceship picture inserted into the background.

'But it would actually take more time to do that than shoot the real time-lapse.'

Those who want to learn Randy’s techniques can join him for a photography workshop in Badlands National Park in South Dakota. Students can learn the basics of timelapse photography, along with how to scout the best locations and deal with changing weather conditions.
