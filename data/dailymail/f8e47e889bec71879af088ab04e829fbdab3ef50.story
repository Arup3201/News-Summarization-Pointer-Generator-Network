From fireball-toting Vikings parading through the streets of Edinburgh to the Romanian farmers who believe their animals temporarily gain the power of speech, New Year's Eve has just as many weird and wonderful traditions of Christmas.

Now some of the most bizarre have been unveiled in a global poll by a social networking website, with Scottish Viking celebrations among those deemed most odd.

Also included on the list was the old Irish custom of banging bread on the walls to scare away evil spirits and the South African tradition of throwing old furniture out of the window on the stroke of midnight.

Ghoulish: Locals in Talca, Chile, like to welcome the new year in the graveyard with dead relations

Most bizarre of all, according to the users of social networking website Badoo, is one unique to a small town in central Chile which sees locals gather in the graveyard on New Year's Eve to welcome the new year in the company of departed relatives.

Talca’s custom of gathering in the 
municipal cemetery on New Year’s Eve is thought to have started when one
 local family broke into the graveyard on the last night of the year to 
be near their dead father. 

The
 town’s mayor now opens the graveyard gates at 11pm on New Year’s 
Eve and thousands of locals stream into the candle-lit necropolis to celebrate while classical music plays.

The tradition also reflects a broader Latin American custom of 
remembering the dead on the annual Day of the Dead, typically held in early 
November.  

'It’s
 not a mournful time but a wonderful, happy way for families to get 
together and preserve the memory of loved ones who have died,' explains Mary
 Andrade, the author of Day 
of the Dead: A Passion for Life.

Chatty? According to Romanian tradition, if animals gain the power of speech, bad times are on the way

Another one bites the dust: Locals in Johannesburg celebrate by flinging old furniture out of the window

'The belief that the soul comes back 
every year, to be honoured by relatives, is a legacy of pre-Hispanic 
civilizations that believed in life after this life.'

In second place is a Romanian ritual, which has proved
particularly popular with farmers, that involves trying to hear animals speaking. If they 
succeed, it’s a bad omen; if they fail, it’s good luck.

Considered almost as bizarre is the custom of throwing furniture from windows to welcome the new year, which is popular all over the world, although it’s practised with the most gusto in the Hillsboro district of Johannesburg.

There, locals celebrate by flinging everything from old microwaves to entire beds through the window, often from tall buildings, causing a headache for local police in the process.

Rounding off the top five was a chilly tradition from Siberia that involves cutting a hole in the ice covering
 Lake Baikal and diving to the bottom while carrying a New Year’s
 tree.

Although Scotland's Viking tradition could only muster eighth place on the list, another Scottish tradition proved more popular.

The Loony Dook, which involves stripping off and plunging into a freezing river, was deemed one of the most entertaining customs by Badoo users, along with Venice's mass-kissing tradition which takes place annually on the stroke of midnight in the historic San Marco square.
