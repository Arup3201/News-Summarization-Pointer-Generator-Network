England rugby legend Jonny Wilkinson was left red faced on Friday after dropping part of the Webb Ellis Cup during a 2015 England Rugby World Cup launch in Newcastle.

The World Cup-winning former England fly-half dropped the base of the illustrious trophy during a photo shoot, but his blushes were saved somewhat after he managed to keep hold of the prized silverware.

The 35-year-old eventually regained his control with a smile as the photo shoot commenced.

The England Rugby 2015 ambassador was in Tyneside to mark one year to go until the first match of the Rugby World Cup - hosted in this country - takes place at St James' Park between South Africa and Scotland.

The milestone coincides with the city hosting their regional 'Try Outs', in addition to the selection events for 'The Pack', and the 6,000 Rugby World Cup 2015 volunteers that will help out with the tournament next year. 

Wilkinson helped launch the search for volunteers back in February, meeting the volunteers to experience the selection process first hand on Friday.
