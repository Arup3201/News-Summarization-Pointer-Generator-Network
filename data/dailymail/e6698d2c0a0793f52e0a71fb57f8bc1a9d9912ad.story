Britain has seen another day of gorgeous
sunshine today, but the good weather is not set to last long as the sun
is replaced by storms and temperatures start to drop.

An early warning of the unsettled conditions came in Scotland yesterday when a village was hit by a tornado which ripped off roof tiles and damaged trees.

And the storms will quickly move across the rest of Britain, with the South East of England set to see as much as 30mm in a single hour tomorrow.

The tornado which struck Bothwell in Lanarkshire yesterday afternoon left residents cowering in fear as the twister ripped through the village.

The streets were strewn with tree branches, roof tiles and other debris, prompting a massive clear-up operation.

Locals described seeing the atmosphere suddenly darken with violent winds prompting the sensation of an earthquake.

'I was sitting in the living room,' said John Rundell, 69. 'The next thing I knew the fire place started shaking as if it was going to collapse.

'I didn’t know what was happening, but I got up and looked out the living room window. I saw loads of roof tiles flying around and crashing down into the street.

'The whole thing lasted around a minute and after it was over lots of neighbours came out to help clear up the mess in the street.'

Destruction: Trees had branches torn off them in the storm, which foreshadows a weekend of bad weather

Ross Neilson, 25, who filmed the terrifying event, added: 'I had just been at a meeting for work when I came out and realised it was very windy.

'As I crossed the road, the winds changed and rubbish started flying about in front of me. The sky grew very dark and there had been thunder grumbling away just before.

'I looked up and could see the winds spiralling and could make out debris being sucked up and spinning about.'

Despite the sunny weather which has been prevailing in most of Britain for the past week, the Met Office has warned that many areas face a sudden downpour tomorrow.

The South East will bear the brunt of the rain, with 30mm forecast to fall within an hour - compared to an average rainfall of 78.1mm in the whole month of July.

Ominous: This weekend is set to bring heavy rain and storms across most of Britain following the heatwave

A Met Office spokesman said: 'It’s going to be very wet over the weekend for some and we have a warning out for Saturday, as the South-East and Cambridgeshire receive a band of thunderstorms and heavy rain that is moving northwards from France.

'Then on Sunday we have another warning for the South West and south-west Wales as well as the East of England and East Midlands, the North West, Yorkshire and Humberside and the North East as well.'

But the downturn in conditions doesn’t necessarily herald the end of summer and a return to the typically wet British climate.

The spokesman said: 'It looks like July is going to end with unsettled conditions, but outside those areas temperatures will be normal for this time of year.

Dry: The lack of rain this month has affected the soil in which crops are grown, such as this wheat field in County Durham

Longing for rain: Farmers and gardeners are likely to welcome the prospect of wet weather this weekend

'Compared to the last couple of weeks, temperatures will be lower, but will still be mainly near or perhaps a little above average for the time of year.

'As a result conditions will feel fresher, especially at night, but it should still feel pleasantly warm in the sunshine.

'Over the weekend outside the areas where there are storms and showers it will be around 26 in the south east, mid 20s in central parts and around 20/21 in the south west.

The Met Office has issued yellow rain
warnings – which advise residents to ‘be aware’ of the risk of flooding
– for the thunder and storms due to hit the South East and the North at
the weekend.

The bleak outlook is a far cry from 
the two previous weekends, during which Britain baked in  temperatures 
of up to 31C (88F) before the thermometer hit its highest point of the 
year this week – a sizzling 33.5C (92F).
