Rivera Gracias was on the FBI's most wanted list because he was suspected of stabbing to death of 69-year-old Richard Limon of Denver

A suspected murderer with a $100,000 reward on his head has appeared in court after turning himself in.

Edwin Ernesto Rivera Gracias was wanted in Jefferson County on suspicion of stabbing to death his girlfriend's stepfather, 60-year-old Richard Limon, of Denver.

Mr Limon was choked, beaten stabbed and his body dumped on Lookout Mountain in 2011, according to the Denver Post.

Rivera Gracias, whose exact birth date is unknown, surrendered on Wednesday less than a fortnight after the FBI placed him on its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.

He voluntarily returned from El Salvador and was accompanied by FBI agents on a flight to Centennial.

Rivera Gracias is also suspected of being a member of the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, a violent gang linked to drug trafficking and murder.

His girlfriend Nena Moya, 19, and her mother Tina Moya, 40, have been convicted for their roles in the killing along with her mother's boyfriend Raul Nunez-Soto, 48.

Tina Moya had asked different people to kill her husband for months and on August 16 2011 the group are alleged to have conspired at her house to murder Mr Limon.

Nunez-Soto and Rivera-Gracias allegedly attempted to suffocate Mr Limon, then beat and stabbed him to death in the RV where he lived in front of Tina Moya's house.

Mr Limon was stabbed nine times and the attack is said to have lasted more than 15 minutes, prosecutors said.

Tina Moya and then-17-year-old Nena Moya, were in the house and aware that Mr Limon was being killed in the RV outside, prosecutors said.

Tina Moya was sentenced to 36 years in prison last week.

Nunez-Soto pleaded guilty last year to second-degree murder and was earlier sentenced to 48 years in prison.

Nena Moya pleaded guilty last year to being an accessory to first-degree murder and was sentenced to two years in a Division of Youth Corrections facility.

Rivera Gracias is being held on charges of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

He is scheduled to return to court on April 3 for a bond hearing and the setting of a preliminary hearing.
