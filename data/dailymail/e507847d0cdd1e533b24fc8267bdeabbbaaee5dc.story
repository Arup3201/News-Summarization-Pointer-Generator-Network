Hungary has deployed cold-war-era tanks to free 10,000 motorists trapped by huge snow drifts as cold weather caused transport chaos across central Europe.

Russian-built T-72 battle tanks trundled along icy roads as thousands of people waited in cars on the M1 motorway from Budapest to Vienna. Many had been stuck since Thursday evening

Thousands of motorists were trapped in heavy snow on Friday as a sudden cold snap and high winds struck parts of the Balkans, Slovakia and Poland, leaving at least two people dead.

Snow stranded people in cars, buses and trains through the night and conspired with strong winds to cut off dozens of towns and villages in Hungary.

'The situation is most critical on the M1 motorway (linking Budapest and Vienna) where hundreds of cars are stranded in the snow, most of them for 18-20 hours now,' said Marton Hajdu, spokesman for the National Directorate for Disaster Management.

A Reuters photographer travelling with a rescue convoy said high winds had caused snowdrifts on the motorway up to a metre (3 feet) high. People took to Facebook to appeal for help.

'There's just one small boat evacuating these people," said Gjergjaj. "We're waiting for the state emergency services to help out.'

Heavy snow also paralysed parts of southeastern Poland, where police banned heavy lorries from entering the city of Rzeszow for fear they would get stuck.

In eastern Slovakia, snow stranded some 40 lorries on a highway in the High Tatras region. The army deployed hundreds of soldiers to help out and authorities appealed to people to avoid venturing out by car.
