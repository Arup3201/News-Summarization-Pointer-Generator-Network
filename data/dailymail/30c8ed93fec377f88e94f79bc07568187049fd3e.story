Andreas Weimann has urged Ron Vlaar and Fabian Delph to stay at Aston Villa.

The striker wants the out of contract pair to ignore any potential moves and stick with Paul Lambert's side.

Skipper Vlaar and England international Delph, who had an appeal against his red card against Sunderland rejected on Tuesday, have so far not signed new deals at Villa Park.

Ron Vlaar is out of contract in the summer and has yet to sign a new deal with Aston Villa

Villa have insisted they will not be sold in January despite their contracts running down and Weimann hopes they will stay long term.

He said: 'Ron is our captain so everyone knows he's important so hopefully he'll stay. He's in the middle of our team and we hope he'll stay.

'He knows we all want him to stay and I'm sure the gaffer and everyone else will try and get him to stay.'

When asked if Villa's new style could also help convince Delph to stay Weimann added: 'Everyone is enjoying the way we're playing at the moment. We can keep going and keep improving.

'I think at the start of the season we didn't have as much of the ball and we were defending for most of the games but in the last five games we've had more possession than the other teams and I think everyone's enjoying playing out from the back and we're all comfortable doing it.'

Fabian Delph was sent off against Sunderland and is also out of contract in the summer

Villa host Crystal Palace on New Year's Day 13th in the Barclays Premier League having lost just twice in their last nine games.

They have also only won twice during that spell - including a 1-0 win at Palace - and Weimann is wary of the Eagles, who could have Alan Pardew in charge by Thursday.

He said: 'I'm sure they'll be up for the game especially as we beat them at their place and they'll probably want to get one back on us.

'I'm sure we'll be ready and thirsty to get the three points.'

Delph will miss that match as he serves the first of a three-game ban following his red card in the goalless draw at home to Sunderland on Sunday.

Delph became the third Villa player to be sent off in four games following the red cards shown to Kieran Richardson and Gabby Agbonlahor, who had his red against Manchester United rescinded.

The 25-year-old will also miss the crucial clash with Leicester, as well as Villa's third-round FA Cup tie at home to Blackpool.

Villa have also only scored seven times at home in the Barclays Premier League, but Weimann is not concerned about their tally.

'You want to score goals in every game. It's about getting the points and if we win 1-0 we're happy with that as well,' he said.

The FA has also fined Villa £30,000 for failing to control their players in the wake of Agbonlahor's dismissal against United.

A number of Villa players remonstrated with referee Lee Mason after the Villa forward was deemed the guilty party in what appeared to be a fair challenge for the ball between him and United's ex-Villa winger Ashley Young.

The FA said Villa had also been warned over their future conduct.
