Three people have been killed and eight injured after a motorist hit a bear and stopped in the middle of a Florida road.

Yoel Menendez, 44, Ricoberto Llanez, 43, and Alain Navarro, 46 were knocked down by an oncoming car when they got out of their vehicle to help a woman who had struck the 300-pound animal while driving her Cadillac SUV.

Seminole Police Department spokesman Gary Bitner said the woman was driving on the two-lane Snake Road just inside Everglades territory when her vehicle hit the bear shortly before 7 p.m. Sunday. 

A helicopter was used to transport the victims to hospital from the scene of the crash on the Big Cypress Seminole Reservation

Three people were killed and several others were injured after an SUV crashed with a bear Sunday evening 15 miles north of Interstate 75 on Snake Road

Four people were transported by air and four people were taken by ground to Broward General Hospital, three were pronounced dead

He said it was after sunset and dark already by that time.

'Three people from a second vehicle got out and tried to help and all were struck and killed by a third vehicle,' Bitner said by telephone, adding events apparently unfolded quickly.

'We've never had an accident involving a black bear,' he noted. 'There are black bears throughout Florida and this is in the Everglades, so there absolutely are black bears in that area.'

He added that 13 people in total were riding in the three vehicles and four were injured severely enough that they had to be taken by helicopter to a South Florida hospital. 

The unusual accident happened around 7 p.m. on Snake Road, a two-lane stretch of highway just north of I-75 on the Big Cypress Seminole Reservation, near the Broward County line

Three people were killed and eight others injured, four seriously, after a car hit a bear in the Everglades on Sunday night, police said

He said four others were taken by ambulances and two of the 13 weren't hurt, including the woman in the initial crash with the bear.

The identities of those involved and the extent of their injuries weren't immediately available, he said, adding accident reconstruction experts were on the scene and details remained uncertain of precisely how events unfolded or the speed and make of the vehicles. 

He said at least two of the vehicles were going in opposite directions.

'They are still trying to figure everything out,' he said.

Bitner said that location is on the approximately 50,000-acre Big Cypress Seminole Reservation, one of several tribal reservations scattered about Florida. 

An SUV struck and killed a black bear and another vehicle behind it stopped to help. Three people from the second vehicle were killed when a third vehicle crashed into the first vehicle, according to Gary Bitner of the Seminole Police Dept

Three were killed and several were injured after a chain reaction crash involving a bear

He said it was also in an area north of the Everglades' Alligator Alley.

Asked about the bear, he said he had no information on its sex or age or any visible behavior at the time.

Encounters with bears in populous Florida are reported sporadically.

Last week, Florida wildlife authorities said they captured and killed a bear that was suspected of being the one that bit a woman on the arm last Wednesday walking her dog in the Orlando suburb of Lake Mary in central Florida. 

Authorities said they also capture d two of the cubs of that bear but one was killed in the process. They added the other cub was old enough to survive on its own and they planned to release it elsewhere.

Black bears are known around Florida, but a crash with one is rare according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission
