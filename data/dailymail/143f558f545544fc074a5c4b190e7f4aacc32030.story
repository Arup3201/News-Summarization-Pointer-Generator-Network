Kent Haruf passed away yesterday at the age of 71 following a battle with cancer

Writer Kent Haruf, who wrote 'Plainsong' and several other novels set in small town Colorado, died yesterday at the age of 71.

Haruf's editor at Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, Gary Fisketjon, confirmed Haruf's death and a spokesman for the company said that the writer had been battling cancer.

Haruf, who spent 30 years teaching English and writing, is survived by his wife, Cathy, and three daughters.

His last novel, 'Our Souls at Night,' will be published next year. 

Mr Fisketjon said: 'Kent had finished all his revisions and even gone through the copy editing,' Fisketjon said. 'We had it scheduled for May, though I haven't yet processed how this tragic news might alter those plans.' 

Haruf was a preacher's son who grew up in a family of book lovers. 

He attended Nebraska Wesleyan University, spent two years in the Peace Corps in Turkey and returned to the U.S. to fine-tune his fiction at the University of Iowa's Writers Workshop.

His first novel, 'The Tie That Binds', was published in 1984 and won a Whiting Writers' Prize and was a runner-up for the PEN/Hemingway award for first fiction. His next book, 'Where You Once Belonged,' came out six years later.

His most recent novel, 2013's 'Benediction', was on the short list for this year's Folio Prize.  

Many of Haruf's novels were set in the fictional small town of Holt, Colorado, a composite of the three Colorado towns where he grew up. 

Knopf said in a statement that the town was 'one of the truly indelible places in American literature'. 

Haruf's first novel, 'The Tie That Binds', was published in 1984 and won a Whiting Writers' Prize and was a runner-up for the PEN/Hemingway award for first fiction; his last novel will be published next year

'Plainsong' is based in Holt, and its narrative circulates among a variety of local residents. Haruf was an admirer of Sherwood Anderson's 'Winesburg, Ohio,' which has a similar structure.

Haruf would credit the works of Hemingway and Faulkner for changing his life. Hemingway's style inspired Haruf to write cleanly and directly. From Faulkner, Haruf felt he had been granted license to take his stories out of the city.

Haruf was a resident of Salida, Colorado.
