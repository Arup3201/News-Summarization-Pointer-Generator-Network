Ed Miliband was accused of resorting to a ‘crass’ class war  by members of his own party last night over a political broadcast depicting Tory ministers as out-of-touch toffs who bully Nick Clegg.

The four-minute film, broadcast as part of Labour’s campaign for this month’s European parliament elections, makes no mention of either Europe or the party.

Instead, Labour has produced a parody of a 1950s B-movie, featuring actors playing Coalition ministers with caricature posh voices receiving afternoon tea from servants around the Cabinet table.

Ed Miliband has been accused of resorting to 'crass' class warfare in Labour's new advert for the European elections which features a shrinking Nick Clegg character (pictured)

The US-style attack advert is based on the 1950s film The Incredible Shrinking Man and seeks to portray Tories (character on right) as out-of-touch toff who bully Nick Clegg (left)

The film, titled The Un-credible 
Shrinking Man, shows an actor playing Mr Clegg shrinking in size as he 
ditches policies such as opposition to university tuition fees.

By the end of the film – a parody of the US 1957 movie The Incredible Shrinking Man – he is a tiny doll-like figure.

The ad is thought to be the first product of Labour's new collaboration with American election guru David Axelrod

One Tory ‘minister’ suggests he should be hunted, before an actor playing David Cameron sets the Downing Street cat on him.

The US-style attack ad is thought to be the first product of Labour’s relationship with American elections guru David Axelrod.

A Labour source said: ‘It was aimed at younger people who don’t usually engage with politics and we think it has been effective.’

Party election campaign co-ordinator Douglas Alexander said the film was ‘a bit of fun’ but made a ‘serious point’.

But critics in the party say its relentlessly negative message suggested a lack of ambition.

Some MPs said it recalled the 2008 Crewe and Nantwich by-election when an attempt to paint Tory candidate Edward Timpson as a toff backfired and led to a humiliating defeat.

One former minister described the film as ‘crass’. He added: ‘We tried waging class war in Crewe. It failed then and it will fail now.

'The trouble is the kids in the leader’s team are probably too young to remember that.’

Another Labour MP said the broadcast was ‘depressing’, adding: ‘Where was the positive vision to attract swing voters?’

Mark Ferguson, editor of the influential grassroots website LabourList, said the film lacked a ‘positive agenda’.

Left-wing Guardian columnist Owen Jones said it was ‘a classic example of politics with the hope stripped away’.

The advert takes place around the Cabinet table as 'posh' Tories lead by an actor playing David Cameron force Nick Clegg to backtrack on policies such as tuition fees

As Clegg abandons each of the policies he shrinks into his suit. However Labour critics say the ad doesn't mention Europe or their party

Mr Clegg tried to laugh off the film’s efforts to ridicule him. He said: ‘They spent money on this? Particularly from Ed Miliband who is the sort of missing man in British politics.

‘He hasn’t breathed a word about the issue we’re supposed to be debating, which is whether we’re in or out of Europe.’
