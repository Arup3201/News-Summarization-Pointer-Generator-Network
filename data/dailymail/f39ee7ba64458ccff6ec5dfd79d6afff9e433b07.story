Thumbs up: Arturo Vidal (left) with Barcelona star and Chile team-mate Alexis Sanchez (right) in hospital after his operation

Arturo Vidal appeared confident of recovering in time for the World Cup after the Chile midfielder underwent right knee surgery on Wednesday - five weeks before his country's first match in Brazil.

'The surgery went very well,' Vidal 
tweeted after the procedure. 'Now, I'll give it my best to join my 
team-mates in Brazil! Go Chile!'

The operation in Barcelona was led by specialist surgeon Ramon Cugat, and was accompanied by Chile and Juventus team doctors.

The club, who won the Serie A title on
 Sunday, said Vidal needed arthroscopic surgery on the lateral meniscus 
of his right knee.

'We 
don't dare to say a recovery time because there's a World Cup in the 
making,' Cugat after the surgery. 'There are many factors at play here: 
He has to be in good form, in a good mood, and his knee has to respond 
well. But he's a very courageous player with a strong character, and 
he's always positive. He's a winner.'

Vidal has been instrumental in helping Juventus to three successive Serie A titles since arriving from Bayer Leverkusen in 2011. He was struggling with problems in his right knee for more than a month, but continued to play for Juventus until his injury worsened during the second leg of the Europa League semifinal against Benfica last Thursday.

'The treatment that has been carried out is correct,' Cugat said, fending off growing criticism in Europe and Chile about how Juventus managed his injury.

'I can say that I have many players, at the international level, who have continued to play with a tear to the lateral meniscus.'

Since joining Juventus, Vidal has transformed impressively from being a stopper to making himself into a versatile player who recovers lost passes, sets up goals and often scores himself. He has eight goals in 46 appearances for Chile, and is among the team's best hopes for the World Cup.

Chile have a strong team, but face huge challenges in Brazil. Chile are in Group B with world and European champion Spain, Holland and Australia.

Even if they advance as the group's second qualifier, they would likely have to play against hosts and five-time champions Brazil. But fans remain confident that Vidal will recover in time, and Chile will continue their solid record: they lost only two out of 15 games last year, including a draw with Spain and win over England in friendlies.

In a statement, Juventus said Vidal will be released from the hospital on Thursday and will return to Turin to continue his recovery. Chilean football association president Sergio Jadue said on Wednesday that he has asked Juventus to let Vidal return to Chile on May 15.

Back home in Chile, President Michelle Bachelet echoed the feelings of the millions of fans who are pinning their hopes on his recovery in time for the World Cup.

'We all want Vidal to play,' Bachelet said on Wednesday. 'Our wish is for his prompt recovery. But he must do the necessary rehabilitation so he can continue to play in the same huge role. If it's not for the first game, we're hoping he can play in the second match.'

After their opening against Australia, Chile face Spain in their second game.
