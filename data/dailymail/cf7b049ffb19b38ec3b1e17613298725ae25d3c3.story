Zara Phillips insists she will carry on competing in top class horse trials despite her pregnancy.

The 32-year-old granddaughter of the Queen, who was part of the Olympic medal-winning British eventing team last summer, is expecting her first baby with husband Mike Tindall in the New Year, Buckingham Palace announced yesterday.

Although the NHS advises pregnant women not to continue with ‘inherently risky’ sports such as horse riding, former world champion Miss Phillips was competing at the Barbury International Horse Trials at the weekend.

Miss Phillips, who is believed to be three months pregnant, came off her horse at one point, but was later described as ‘fine’.

Yesterday a spokesman for Miss Phillips, as she is still known professionally, said she would carry on competing for several weeks at least. She is currently entered into three events later this month, with rides on six horses.

The spokesman said: ‘She will definitely be back in the saddle soon. It’s business as usual at the moment.

‘She is entered into several events, but as with any rider, they treat each event on a case-by-case basis and if she pulls out of an event it will be because the horse isn’t ready, rather than her.’

But she later cautioned: ‘As you can imagine she is following all medical advice from her doctors. She is being sensible about this and is listening to what the doctors are telling her.

‘She couldn’t be happier about the baby and would never put her pregnancy in jeopardy.’

Miss Phillips is well aware of the dangers of riding. She broke her collarbone in 2008 after she came off her horse at an event in France.

The animal, Tsunami II, broke its neck and was killed in the fall. Two years previously her close friend, world-class rider Sherelle Duke, died when her horse fell on top of her during a competition.

The news that another royal baby is on the way was announced formally in a statement by

'Thanks for all the kind messages, we are very excited and I agree with you all that hopefully he/she won’t have my nose'

Mike Tindall

Buckingham Palace yesterday. It said: ‘Mr and Mrs Mike Tindall are very pleased to announce that Zara Tindall is expecting a baby in the New Year.

The Princess Royal and Captain Mark Phillips, Mr Phillip and Mrs Linda Tindall, and members of both families are delighted with the news.

‘This baby will be the first child for Mike and Zara and the third grandchild for The Princess Royal.’ The baby is believed to be due in January.

The Queen was said to be ‘delighted’ about another addition to her family, as were the parents of Miss Phillips and Tindall.

A spokesman for David Cameron said he would ‘send his very, very best wishes to the happy couple’. Later Tindall, a former England rugby captain, joked on Twitter: ‘Thanks for all the kind messages, we are very excited and I agree with you all that hopefully he/she won’t have my nose.’

He has long been the butt of jokes for his misshapen nose, the result of several breaks during his international rugby career.

Last night his father, Phil, told the Daily Mail: ‘We are very happy obviously and looking forward to having another baby in the family. Mike’s big brother had a daughter in February so it’s not our first grandchild and we know what to expect.

‘Mike rang to tell us about two weeks ago. We haven’t seen Mike or Zara since they told us the news but [we have] spoken to them on the phone. Obviously Mike is very happy and excited to be a father.’

The child will be 16th in line to the throne following the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s first baby later this month. It is believed Miss Phillips’s mother, Princess Anne, rode until she was 34 weeks pregnant.

And eventer Mary King, who rode for Britain at six consecutive Olympics, competed until she was five and a half months pregnant.

She said: ‘The team doctor said that the baby was perfectly safe inside you, if you’re happy with what you’re doing just crack on.'

The Mail’s medical expert, Dr Martin Scurr, said he advised mothers-to-be not to wrap themselves in cotton wool.

‘I think pregnant women shouldn’t be too over-protected and there is very little I wouldn’t advise them to do. She is a professional athlete and I really can’t see the harm in it,’ he said.

‘The fact is that her body will soon grow to such an extent that it probably wouldn’t be practical for her to compete anyway, although she could still ride for fun.’

The Queen's granddaughter Zara and Mr Tindall have talked openly about their desire to start a family.

The pair's sporting commitments - particular Zara's Olympic dreams - have meant their schedules were hectic and much of their time was devoted to their respective rugby and eventing careers.

In the summer of 2012, former world champion Zara achieved her dream of competing in the Olympics, winning a team silver in front of a home crowd in London.

Tindall spoke about how they were waiting for the right window before having a baby.

‘Obviously we're going to have a family. But it's about timing,’ he said at the launch of his new charity Rugby For Heroes in May 2012.

‘Obviously it's the Olympics this year, the Europeans next year, the World Championships the year after for her. I want to play for another two years, so it's just where we find the balance in that.

‘I wouldn't say we'll wait, we'll try and find a window.’

The pair are already a doting aunt and 
uncle to their two nieces, Savannah and Isla - the daughters of Zara's 
brother Peter and his wife Autumn.

The royal baby will be the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's fourth great grandchild, after Savannah and Isla Phillips and William and Kate's baby, which is due this month.

Zara's pregnancy comes in the year of the 60th anniversary of the Queen's coronation, with the baby set to arrive in the New Year of 2014.

The couple wed in July 2011 in Edinburgh's Canongate Kirk in a private ceremony attended by all the senior members of the Royal Family, three months after Zara's cousin William married Kate.

Tindall said his wedding topped winning the World Cup, and Zara described the day as ‘amazing’.

Just months later, newlywed Tindall was fined and booted out of the England rugby squad for drunken antics during the World Cup in New Zealand.

He apparently took part in a ‘dwarf tossing’ competition with fellow players and was seen embracing an ex-girlfriend.

He was later reinstated to the team and had his fine reduced because he could not remember the drinking session and did not intentionally mislead the RFU team management

The Princess Royal's daughter and Tindall met at the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia.

They moved in together, sharing The Bothy, on Anne's Gatcombe Park estate which was a gift from the Princess Royal, but later settled in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, before moving back to her mother's estate in January 2013.

Zara has spoken about the importance of her relationship with her husband. She met him just after she found out her horse, Toytown, which she had wanted to ride in the 2008 Olympics, had become injured.

‘He met me just after I'd found out my horse had injured himself, so I was quite low and vulnerable,’ she said.

‘No, he understands the pressures, and vice versa, which obviously helps, but it actually started from becoming very good friends.’

Zara is currently 14th in line to the throne, but does not hold a royal title and is not an HRH.

Their children will be plain Miss or Master Tindall.
