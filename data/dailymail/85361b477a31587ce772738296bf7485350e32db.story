Acquitted: Casey Anthony was found not guilty in the murder of her daughter Caylee, whose remains were found in December 2008

Casey Anthony’s parents, brother, cops and TV reporters are all expected to testify in an upcoming defamation trial in a witness list that includes Anthony herself.

The Orlando, Florida, woman was acquitted in the death of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee, but her legal troubles are not yet over.

She has been sued for defamation by a woman with the same name of a babysitter that Anthony told police kidnapped Caylee shortly after the toddler’s disappearance.

Zenaida Gonzalez says her life was ruined when police began questioning her, as she lost her house, her housekeeping job and received numerous death threats.

The Orlando Sentinel reported that Gonzalez’s lawyers originally submitted a witness list of about 90 people who would be called to testify at the trial, which begins in January.

Anthony’s lawyers later argued that so many people was far too many, so Gonzalez’s lawyers cut the list to about 24.

The witnesses making the final cut include Anthony’s parents, George and Cindy, her brother Lee, police officers that led the investigation into Caylee’s disappearance and local reporters like Michelle Meredith of WESH and Kathi Belich of WFTV, according to the Sentinel.

Her parents, George and Cindy, have reportedly not seen Casey since she was found not guilty in the murder of Caylee, whose remains were found in December 2008.

In the three-year saga between Anthony's arrest and her acquittal, she was branded America's most hated mother.

Seeking punitive damage against Anthony, Ms Gonzalez’ Attorney John Dill said he fully expects to hear 'Miss Anthony has no money,' but they plan to seek 'the source of the Casey Anthony trust fund,’ along with ‘any income from any book deals or publicity.'

At the beginning of Anthony's murder trial her lawyer told the court that Caylee accidentally drowned in the family's swimming pool and dropped the bombshell that the nanny never existed.

Anthony, 26, was found not guilty of murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter on July 5, 2011.

She was convicted of four counts of lying to police, and sentenced to time served.

Victim: Caylee Marie Anthony went missing in June 2008 and was found in a wooded area near her grandparents house six months later

She is now on probation for an unrelated cheque fraud at an undisclosed location in Florida.

If Anthony does testify, it would be the first time she would have been seen publicly since shortly after her acquittal.

Her current whereabouts have been kept secret because she has received death threats.
