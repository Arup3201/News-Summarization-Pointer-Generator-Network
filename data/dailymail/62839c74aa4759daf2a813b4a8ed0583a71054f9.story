Denied: Lisa Mehos, whose abortion was used against her in a custody battle, has lost her kids

The mother-of-two whose post-divorce abortion was used against her in a custody battle has lost the children over her rampant pill abuse, it has emerged.

A Manhattan judge ruled that Lisa Mehos, 38, should not be the primary caregiver for the children, aged four and six, because of lies she reportedly told about her drug use.

Justice Lori Sattler said in her ruling that Mehos had lied to her, court experts, doctors and drug counselors about her problem, the New York Daily News reported.

Mehos, who divorced her banker Manny 
in 2011, had claimed she started taking antidepressants after the split 
but subpoenaed records showed she had actually been reliant on them 
since she married her husband in 2006, according to the court ruling.

It
 revealed that she has been prescribed drugs, including Xanax and 
Valium, by 28 different doctors since 2008 - even sometimes getting 
prescriptions from 2 different doctors on the same day.

Sattler
 ruled that the drugs use endangered her children, citing one example 
from 2012 where she passed out on a place and her son, then two, ran in 
the aisle without pants or a diaper.

The decision comes after she admitted to
 having sex with a friend a year after her marriage to 
Mehos, 59, came to an end, and the fling resulted in her being 
pregnant and having an abortion.

Mr Mehos and his 'relentless' attorney 
Eleanor Alter went so far as to suggest that Mrs Mehos' abortion 
undermined her claim of being a Catholic, which in turn speaks to her 
overall credibility.

After subpoenaing Mrs Mehos' medical 
records to show that she had an abortion, Ms Alter used the procedure to
 suggest she was a hypocrite for asking to have custody of her two 
children over Easter.

Alter also said the pregnancy showed she might have
 been dishonest when she claimed she never had men over to her apartment.

As a result, Mrs Mehos was forced to testify about having sex with a long-term friend at his home.

Her husband used the abortion against her in court to increase his custody prospects and Lisa lost temporary custody of her daughter Macy, six, and son John, four, in August.

Speaking to the New York Post, she said: 'I’m divorced. I’m not Mother Teresa! I feel like I’ve been beaten up and raped. I had sex with someone I knew for 20 years, and I’m somehow this terrible, bad parent!'

She now only sees her children on Mondays and alternate weekends.

'It just breaks my heart. They're so confused,' she said.

It's not the first time the couple have made headlines for a court appearance.

Mr
 Mehos was arrested last year and accused of battering his wife but 
charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence after he claimed
 her black eye was from a Botox injection.

Earlier this month, a Texas judge also ruled 
that Manny no longer had to pay Lisa $5,000-a-month in child support, leaving her to fear she could lose her Upper West Side apartment.

Her lawyer is appealing the ruling.

The most recent decision also allows Mr Mehos to move their children back to Houston, but that he is responsible for his ex-wife's travel expenses when she visits.

The judge said she'll reconsider the custody arrangement if Mrs Mehos has clean drug tests for a year.
