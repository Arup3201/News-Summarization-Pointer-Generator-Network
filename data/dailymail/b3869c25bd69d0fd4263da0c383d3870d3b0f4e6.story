Sportscaster Ahmed Rashad and his estranged wife Sale Johnson have officially ended their marriage, it was revealed today.

However, the split was ‘amicable,’ according to a statement exclusively obtained by the New York Post’s Page Six.

They said that they will continue to co-parent their granddaughter, Ava, the only grandchild of Sale’s late daughter Casey.

The statement said that Rashad and 
Johnson’s divorce has always been ‘amicable,’ and they ‘remain committed
to jointly raising our daughter.’

The divorce comes on the heels of Johnson booting Rashad from the property they once shared in a lavish Florida complex.

Johnson taken drastic measures to keep Rashad away, including hiring guards.

Their home, which is reportedly worth
about $5million, is on the Bears Club complex in Jupiter, a collection 
of multimillion-dollar homes that NBA legend Michael Jordan also calls 
home.

Golf superstar Tiger Woods, who has been through some marriage troubles of his own, also lives nearby.

A source told Gossip Extra that
Rashad was recently able to get through the gate when he arrived at the
home, but 'guards escorted him out' as he tried to get into the 
clubhouse.

It's the first salvo in what is believed to be an ugly divorce between the former football player and his wife.

A source told Gossip Extra: 'Sale cut 
Ahmad off from all the clubs they’re members of, and had the fob that 
gets him through the guard gate at the Bears Club deactivated.'

The Post reported that the home is under Johnson's name.

The marriage to Ms Johnson in 2007 was Rashad's fourth.

He was previously married to Deidre Waters, Matilda Johnson and 'Cosby Show' actress Felicia Rashad.

Johnson is the ex-wife of Johnson & Johnson heir and New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, from whom she collected $100million in their divorce, according to the New York Post.

A source told Gossip Extra that Johnson is protected by a prenuptial agreement that blocks Rashad from receiving a dime from her once the divorce is final.
