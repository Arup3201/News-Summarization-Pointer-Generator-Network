Repeat offender: Paul Francis' previous convictions included a nine-year jail term for indecent assault and intercourse with a girl under 16

A paedophile with a 30-year criminal record abused a ten-year-old girl he lured into his home after a housing association allowed him to live near a playground.

Paul Francis, 62, was given a home next to a local park, nursery and youth group by a 
housing association that failed to spot his background of child sex 
crimes.

He watched the young girl from his bedroom window in Yeovil, Somerset, as she played in the playground below. Francis used his window as a vantage point to take photos of the 10-year-old on the swings, before later inviting her back to his home.

Posing as a singing teacher, Francis 
approached the girl outside her school gates and handed her a 
colourful invitation to join a singing group at his home.

She
arrived accompanied by her best friend and Francis made them look at 
adult porn before photographing them and asking them to take their 
clothes off.

On another occasion he grabbed the best friend’s hand before moving it 
to his penis and telling her he would 'show her how to make a man 
excited'.

Francis also left notes for the 10-year-old on his front door, telling her she was beautiful and he wanted to kiss her.

The abuse only stopped when the schoolgirl told a Police Community Support Officer visiting her school what had happened.

Francis was today jailed for four years at Taunton Crown Court, Somerset, after he admitted two counts
 of sexual assault on a child under 13 and one of attempting to cause a 
child under 13 to engage in sexual behaviour.

He also pleaded guilty 
to causing a child to watch a sexual act, of causing or inciting child 
prostitution and of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in 
sexual activity.

The court was read a list of 
his previous convictions which included a nine-year jail term for 
indecent assault and intercourse with a girl under 16. Francis’ most recent conviction was for indecent exposure in 2005.

Mr Recorder Philip Mott, QC, said: 'This is a case where the activity 
taken in isolation without the background of your history and the 
documents found in your possession might have seen comparitively minor.

'But
 they are more serious. They together describe what is not disputed, 
that you are clearly dangerous and there is significant risk of serious 
harm of future offences carried out by you.'

The court heard Francis’ abuse began in March 2014 after Yarlington Housing Group, who manage 9,000 properties around Somerset region, moved him into supported housing.

No background checks were run and he was placed just yards away from a local park, nursery and youth group.

His bedroom window overlooked the child’s play area and he used the view to pick out the ten-year-old as a target.

When schoolgirl arrived at his house on March 23, the meeting quickly turned sinister when he started to show them pornographic pictures.

Malcolm Galloway, prosecuting, said: 'It is not disputed that this defendant has a serious and entrenched attraction to children. This was a clear attempt to attract, then groom, children.

'She visited his home the following day, where he showed the girls rude pictures and photo albums of them fully clothed.

'Francis took hold of the other girl’s hand and told her he would show her how to make a man excited before placing her hand on his willy.

'He tried to take the other girl’s hand but she refused, the girls left some time later.'

The court heard Francis showed the girls photographs he had taken of them on the swings before making the girl pose for more pictures, telling her it would be okay if she took her clothes off.

Although the girls refused the court was told evidence from his flat showed the pictures would have later been sold on the internet.

On one occasion he told the ten year-old he had 'begun to love you in an ungrown-up like way which other grown-ups don’t like to know about'.

When arrested, police discovered a disgusting diary documenting the day’s events and his vile plans for the future.

Rebecca Bradbury, defending, said: 'He has always expressed he found relief at being arrested.

'At the time of the offences he was no longer under the Thames Valley Sex Offenders Programme which he describes as being "marvellous".

'He wants help. He has frightened himself by view of these offences and he knows he cannot drop his guard and has to keep himself in check.'

Francis will serve up to four years in prison and be subject to an extended six years on licence.

He was ordered to sign the sex offenders register and made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order for life.

Detective Constable Andrew Tearle said he fears 'predatory' Paul Francis has committed more disgusting offences.

After the case he said: 'Paul Francis acted in a predatory manner to target young girls with promises of music lessons and being in a band.

'In reality, he exploited their innocent dreams to build relationships with them and abuse them.

'I hope that in receiving a lengthy custodial sentence he recognises the seriousness of his actions.

'Francis targeted his victims with hand-drawn posters advertising singing lessons in Yeovil and when we searched his house we found posters dating back to time spent living in west Somerset.

'My fear is that he may have committed offences in that area and I would encourage anyone who has concerns about the individual to get in touch and discuss them with us.'

A spokeswoman for Yarlington Housing Group today said: 'We can confirm that Mr Paul Francis was a tenant of Yarlington Housing Group, but as a result of action taken by Yarlington, he ended his tenancy in March 2014 following his arrest for a serious criminal offence.

'Where a housing applicant is a registered sex offender, we liaise closely with the Police and the Probation Services to ensure any potential risk to the community is adequately managed.

'At the time of his application, Mr Francis was not on the sex offenders register.

'We are aware that he has now been convicted of charges brought against him and our thoughts go out to the families who have been affected by his offences at this difficult time.

'Yarlington takes a robust approach to dealing with criminal offences and anti-social behaviour that occur within its properties, and aims to take swift action to protect our communities.

'In this respect, we work in close partnership with statutory and voluntary agencies, and when necessary the Police.'
