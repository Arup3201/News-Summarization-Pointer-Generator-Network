The grandfather of a six-year-old girl whose tongue was ripped out by pit bulls has said he forgives the man who owned the dogs in an astonishing show of compassion.

Zainabou Drame remains in a medically induced coma at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center following the incident outside her home on June 4 that left her with numerous facial injuries.

The dogs, which were killed, were owned by Zontae Irby, a 24-year-old neighbor who was arrested on drugs charges after police searched his home following the attack - but the girl's grandfather, Leslie McElrath Jr., says he holds no ill feelings towards him.

'I am a man of scriptures,' McElrath told the Cincinnati Enquirer. 'The angry man does not receive the righteousness of God.'

Staying strong: Leslie McElrath Jr. said his granddaughter Zainabou Drame has had most of her face reconstructed since she was attacked by two pit bulls outside their home on June 4

The grandfather, a lab technician, said doctors are slowly piecing the young girl back together - although they have not yet been able to re-attach her tongue.

'One dog grabbed her face and literally tore it off,' he said. 'The other one pulled her mouth off. That hurt her tear duct. They've fixed that, and they reattached her face.

'[The dogs] broke her jaw, too. The doctors worked on that. They repaired her chin and changed the trach tube in her esophagus.'

He added: 'They may be able to reattach her tongue someday or grow a new one. You can't believe the stuff modern medicine does.'

McElrath described how his daughter's child had been playing tag with other neighborhood children when the attack began.

She
 had returned to the house for a drink and was not going to go outside 
again, but one of her small friends knocked on the door and convinced her.

Rescue: A police officer can be seen on dashcam 
video jumping from a moving patrol car to save the six-year-old girl as she was being attacked. The officers shot dead the two dogs and took away a third

Taken to safety: Footage shows Zainabou Drame being carried to an ambulance on a stretcher

When she returned to the street, the two dogs escaped through a broken fence further up the street and lunged at the little girl.

Hope: Doctors have reconstructed Zainabou's face but have not yet reattached her tongue

'The pit 
bulls got Zaina because she was the smallest of the kids, like the 
jackals do with the herds on "Wild Kingdom",' McElrath said.

After hearing calls for help, his daughter Tanina ran outside with a baseball bat to beat the two dogs, while his own dog, Cappuccino, tried its best to pull the larger animals off the small girl.

Dashcam footage also shows police officers speeding towards the house before jumping outside their patrol car and shooting the pit bulls dead.

McElrath said he is thankful for Tanina and Cappuccino as well as Cincinnati Police Officer 
Josh Bricker who cleared her esophagus, meaning Zainabou did not choke on her own blood.

He said he wants 'to thank that officer. I gave one of the other cops a hug and 
told him that was for the big guy' - Bricker. 'I want him 
to know how thankful I am. He saved her life,' he said.

Despite the long road ahead, McElrath said he wants his granddaughter's story to be one of hope.

'What happened to Zaina is not about 
dividing people, attacking someone, putting someone in jail, banning pit
 bulls or killing dogs,' he said. 'This is an opportunity to 
come together; to show the city how much people care, to help heal a 
little girl.'

mother Tanina Drame (right) when his sister was being attacked; Tanina

girl

Distraught: Zainabou Drame's family, including her grandfather, left, 
said they could barely recognize the little girl after the attack as 
most of her face had been mauled by the dogs

He added: 'I'm sad. But I'm not angry. I'm quiet because I'm praying to God to take care of her.'

No charges have yet been filed from the attack but Irby has been indicted on trafficking in marijuana, possession of marijuana and receiving stolen property charges.

SPCA of 
Cincinnati crew seized a third pit bull owned by Irby. Officers shot the other two dogs dead on the scene after distracting them away from the girl.

'It’s 
really indescribable and something no person should ever have to see and
 something we’ll never forget,' Cincinnati Police Officer Kyle Strunk said.

Now the family said it is trying to stay strong for Zainabou.

Her father, Abdou Drame, previously said he could barely recognize his daughter's mauled face.

Scene: Zainabou was attacked outside her home on the 2900 block of Aquadale Lane in Westwood

'When I see her, I cannot handle it because it's so bad. All the face gone,' he said.

Gina Tyus, Zainabou's aunt, described her niece's injuries as 'gruesome' and said one of her eyes had been sewn shut because the muscle beneath it no longer worked.

'Both
 the dogs, one on each side, latched onto her face and ripped her jaw 
almost completely off. It was broken to the point where you could 
actually pull it away from her face,' Tyus said.

'She is lying there - her face is swollen almost beyond recognition. I thank God she is still here.'
