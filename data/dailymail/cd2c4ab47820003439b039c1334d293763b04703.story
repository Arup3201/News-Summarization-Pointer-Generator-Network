One of Labour’s rising stars was last night accused of thwarting a mission to save the British doctor who died in a Syrian jail.

The grieving family of Dr Abbas Khan, 31, claimed that Chuka Umunna – Dr Khan’s MP – told a delegation not to travel to Damascus to lobby for his release.

Last night Streatham MP Umunna released a statement in which he insisted that he had done everything in his power to help Dr Khan.

The family of Dr Abbas Khan, including mother Fatima and brother Afrozi, has said Labour MP Chuka Umunna stopped a delegation travelling to Syria to lobby for their son's release

Syrian officials, who have been accused of torturing the doctor, claimed that he ‘committed suicide’ by hanging himself with his pyjamas in the state interrogation centre in Damascus last week.

The Syrian regime handed the body to the International Committee of the Red Cross yesterday, who took it by road to Beirut, from where it will be flown back to the UK.

Mr Umunna, who is shadow Business Secretary, has said he did everything in his power to help Khan

The surgeon, who was a specialist registrar at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore, North-West London, went to the Turkish-Syrian border in October 2012 to treat wounded refugees.

He then crossed the border into Syria and began working in a field hospital in the war-ravaged city of Aleppo treating civilians.

He was arrested within 48 hours by government forces as he did not have a valid visa.

His arrest came at a time when hundreds of Britons were suspected of entering Syria to join Al Qaeda. No evidence has emerged that  Dr Khan had any involvement  with militants.

Dr Khan’s sister Sara, 24, said that her family had expected Mr Umunna to discuss Dr Khan’s case with David Cameron.

‘He could have got my brother released much earlier as he could have pressed the Foreign Office to help,’ she said. Another member of the Khan family described Mr Umunna as a ‘chicken MP’.

Dr Khan died just days before a delegation of British parliamentarians were due to visit Damascus to secure his release.

The family say the group was initially due to fly out last month, but accused Mr Umunna of ‘sabotaging’ the plan by warning MPs about the safety risks.

Labour MP Dave Anderson, who was going to lead the delegation, confirmed that he was advised by Mr Umunna not to travel.

Mr Anderson said: ‘I then took further advice from a number of people, friends of mine who have got interests out there, and they said I would be OK.’

Outspoken MP George Galloway, who was involved in negotiating for the release of Dr Khan, said of Mr Umunna: ‘He was the dog which didn’t bark.

Dr Khan was imprisoned in Syria after going to treat wounded civilians and was due to be released before the Syrian government claimed he hung himself

'I don’t know why he was reluctant to get involved... Was it because of the false tittle-tattle around Parliament that Abbas was a Jihadi? I hope not.’

Mr Umunna said in a statement: ‘For over 12 months now I have  been in contact with members of  his family and the Foreign Office, doing what I can to assist the family as they have tried to secure  his release.’

The Foreign Office said: ‘We consistently sought consular access to Dr Khan and information on his detention.

These requests were consistently ignored.’ Last night Dr Khan’s mother, Fatima, 57, was seen leaving the morgue in Beirut where her son’s body was being kept. Clearly distressed, she said: ‘They’ve killed my baby.’

The body was later transferred to the British Embassy in Beirut and was due to be flown to the UK today.

As Dr Khan’s body was driven out of Syria yesterday a British medical convoy of 50 ambulances were heading into the country from Turkey.

Dr Abbas Khan, the British Muslim surgeon who risked his life to save women and children in the Syrian inferno, is far more than an isolated hero or martyr.

He is a rallying figure – a symbol of all that is decent and humane in the vast majority of the Muslim population throughout the world.

Hence his martyrdom must not be merely acknowledged as an independent incident; he should be elevated into a figure of world importance.

Dr Abbas Khan was due to be released on Friday after being arrested in Syria last year

His name should be perpetuated posthumously, perhaps by awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize, or putting his name to an institute for research on human rights, conflict resolution or countering radicalism. It would be a fitting tribute.

I believe that the terrible story  of his imprisonment, which included sadistic treatment and torture, demands a clear and uncompromising attitude from all who wish to avenge it and prevent continuing practices of this kind.

World opinion must reflect the fact that Dr Khan represents the best in universal values while at the same time intensifying an implacable and merciless fight against Jihadism and extremism. There must be no excuses for slacking in this respect.

The treatment of this family man, tortured and killed in prison, defies description. I resent people telling me that it is something from the Middle Ages; it is not.

The Middle Ages included some highlights of civilisation. No, this is the Stone Age plus technology.

Dr Khan’s appalling case destroys the myths of the Islamophobes. It shows everyone that Muslims are on the same side as the rest of us in the fight for humanity and against extremism.

This is not an argument based on partisanship for Israel, or a fear that Israel is threatened.

Jihad threatens other Muslims and non-Muslims even worse than it does the Jews because they can look after themselves. Israel can ward off these attacks.

But the rest of the world is not sufficiently protected because it is confused. The media has a crucial role in pointing out this international threat, a role it has not yet played.

Dr Khan’s death must therefore be a clarion call to ensure there are no limits in the fight against Jihadism.

Day before his death Khan wrote to his family, including son Abdullah, saying he wanted to come home

When you look at the excesses of the SS, or the Soviet torturers, even they were less brutal than the Jihadists, and less dangerous for one good reason: the Jihadist thinks he’s got God in his pocket.

The Nazis and the Communists had Hitler and Stalin to look up to but the Jihadists claim to speak in the name of God, whether it be through their suicide bombers or their executions or their punishment amputations.

One cannot help feel that the so-called compromise over the dismantling of Syria’s chemical weapons, brokered by Putin and accepted by Obama, is immoral.

It ensures for Assad immunity from either military intervention or support in favour of the opposition – purely in exchange for the surrender of a chemical arsenal.

An analogy would be the police saying to a mass murderer: ‘Look, if you’re prepared to show us where you keep your really sophisticated weaponry we promise that you can carry on killing in the old traditional way.’

In effect it means that Assad can continue undisturbed, supported by Russian and Iranian arms, to massacre women and children and almost certainly achieve victory.

'One cannot help feel that the so-called compromise over the dismantling of Syria's chemical weapons, brokered by Putin and accepted by Obama, is immoral'

Numerous voices from the opposition are now expressing their regret at ever having taken up arms in the light of the failing support from the free world.

Of course, the very convincing argument now put forward is that Assad is no worse – in some ways he may be better – than the radical extremists he is fighting.

Today the situation is so terrible we don’t know which side is worse.

But the point must be made that all this might have been prevented had the West, notably Obama, intervened at the outset; for instance, imposing a no-fly zone and guarding the porous frontiers against the influx of such extreme elements as Al Qaeda.

The least we should achieve  now in honouring the memory of Dr Abbas Khan is to ensure that the barbarous acts against him and others are treated as a priority by all mankind. We must not hesitate in our battle against extremism.
