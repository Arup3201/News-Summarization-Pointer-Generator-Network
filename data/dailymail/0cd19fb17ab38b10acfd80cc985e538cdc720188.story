A landlord is facing court for allegedly failing to carry out repairs on a damp property where a young newly-wed mother died after suffering a series of chest infections.

Stacy Bowman, 25, passed away in her sleep in the mouldy property in Stoke-on-Trent while she was five months pregnant with her second child.

The council had ordered the landlord Saint Pir Pandariman to carry out improvement works on the home.

He now faces prosecution after allegedly failing to do the work and he is likely to appear before magistrates next month.

Mrs Bowman shared the property with her husband Lee who she had married just a few weeks before she died in December.

They had made numerous complaints to their landlord about the state of their home which they only moved into last August.

Stoke City Council said the landlord was served with an enforcement requiring him to carry out repairs by November 25 last year. Stacy died on December 4

Inspectors went back to the property just two days before Stacy passed away, only to find the landlord had not done the work.

Mr Bowman believes the condition of the property may have had a significant part to play in her death.

The barman said: 'She went to sleep and never woke up. The worst part was when the paramedics came and said they couldn't do anything - it was the worst moment of my life.

'The damp and mould was really bad.'

A post-mortem revealed that Stacy died from inflammation to the heart and lungs. She left behind a daughter, Molly, from a previous relationship.

Previous tenants in the property had complained about the state of the house and environmental health officers had launched an investigation.

A Facebook tribute site was set-up following Stacy's death last December and so far over 400 people have joined the page.

Her husband Lee Bowman wrote: 'Can't believe you have gone babe, missing you so much already. We have been married four months today and thought we had years ahead of us.

'I just want to know why you were snatched away from me and Molly. Look after yourself and baby Leyton for me. Love you both to bits and I will see you soon.

'Love you always and forever Mrs B.'

Stacy's cousin Laina Gilbride said: 'Can't believe I am writing on a tribute page for you, it still doesn't seem real.

'I
thought we have had many more years together. It still hasn't sunk in 
properly yet. I know you and your little man are safe up there now.'

Linda Podmore said: 'Stacy you now have your heavenly wings.

'Sleep
well babe knowing your loving family will take real good care of Molly.
I'm sure she will turn out the same feisty lady that you were.'

Tony Oakman, director of people services at the council, said they were hoping to prosecute the landlord.

He said: 'Shortly after Mr Bowman moved into his rented property in August 2011 an environmental health officer inspected it.

'This inspection revealed some repair 
issues. While these issues, we believe, would not have had a significant
impact on the occupiers' health or safety, the housing standard team 
served an enforcement notice on the landlord requiring them to complete 
the repair works by November 25.

'During a re-inspection on December 2, it was identified that the landlord has not completed the repair works.

'The council is preparing a prosecution case against the landlord for not carrying out the repairs.'

It had not been possible to contact Saint Pir Pandariman.
