A far-right 'anti-Islamisation' rally in Germany has been cancelled after a 'concrete threat' to kill one of the protest group's leaders was made.

Pegida - or 'patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the west' - have held weekly rallies, with more than 25,000 people at last week's demonstration.

But police have banned today's gathering in Dresden because of the murder threat against a founder of the group, which the protesters say came from 'ISIS terrorists'.

A far-right 'anti-Islamisation' rally - known as Pegida - in Dresden, Germany, has been cancelled after a 'concrete threat' to kill one of the group's leaders

More than 25,000 people took part in the last rally but police have banned the weekly demonstration because of the threat

Organiser Kathrin Oertel (right) said the protest group would not be silenced as she gave a news conference alongside Lutz Bachmann, a founder of the group believed to be the target of the threat

The target of the threat is believed to be Lutz Bachmann, the 41-year-old butcher's son who founded Pegida in November, the Guardian reported. 

Bachmann has overseen the protests as the group's numbers have grown from a few hundred to tens of thousands in just months.

According to a post on Pegida's Facebook page, a 'concrete murder threat' was received. 

'[The] execution was ordered by the IS terrorists,' it said.

Police have not made it clear who made the threat but said it came from a tweet, in Arabic, which described the far-right group as an 'enemy of Islam'.

Dresden police chief Dieter Kroll said plotters planned to mingle among protesters before unleashing their attack, with no information on how it would be carried out, leading officials to cancel the demonstration.

Pegida instead called on its supporters to hang German flags out of their windows. 

German police said the threat is believed to have come from an Arabic tweet, while a separate report suggested intelligence officials were investigating a terror attack plot at train stations in Dresden and Berlin

 Pegida rallies have been taking place across Germany, as well as in Austria, Switzerland, Scandinavia and Spain

Co-organiser Kathrin Oertel said the protesters wouldn't be silenced and the cancellation 'doesn't mean that we'll let ourselves be gagged.' Bachmann says another demonstration is planned for next week.

A report in German newspaper Der Spiegel also suggested the cancellation came as intelligence sources investigated threats of terrorist attacks at train stations in Berlin an Dresden, as well as a threat to the Pegida rally.

Security has been tightened in Europe over the past few weeks in the wake of the attacks in France which killed 17 and a thwarted plot in Belgium. EU foreign ministers are meeting today to discuss terror developments.

Pegida rallies have been taking place across Germany, as well as in Austria, Switzerland, Scandinavia and Spain. 

The anti-Islamisation group want restrictions on foreigners entering Germany and a tightening of asylum laws.

German politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, last week joined a Muslim rally against Pegida at the Brandenburg Gate in central Berlin.

'Hatred, racism and extremism have no place in this country,' she said before the march. 

'We are a country based on democracy, tolerance and openness to the world.'

Benjamin Netanyahu has announced plans to increase trade with the Far East following a 'wave of Islamisation' in western Europe.

The Israeli Prime Minister said rising hostility in Europe had forced his hand into expanding trade with countries like Japan, China and India.

'We definitely want to reduce our dependence on certain markets in western Europe,' Mr Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting yesterday.

'Western Europe is undergoing a wave of Islamisation, of anti-Semitism, and of anti-Zionism. It is awash in such waves, and we want to ensure that for years to come the state of Israel will have diverse markets all over the world.'

His remarks came as Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, arrived in Israel with a trade delegation.

According to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, Europe accounted for 45.8 percent of imports and 35.8 percent of exports in the first 11 months of 2014. Asia accounted for 22.5 percent of Israeli imports and 25.4 percent of exports.

Viewers of Israel's parliamentary TV channel were asked: 'Can Israel do without exports to Europe and pursue policy that is liable to bring about an economic embargo?'

62 two percent of Israelis said no and 32 percent said yes.
