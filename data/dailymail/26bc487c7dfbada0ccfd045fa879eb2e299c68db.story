Former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher just bought his first American property, in the form of a two-bedroom condo in a New York landmark.

His condo, in the iconic Essex House, features a large living space, modern kitchen, and even a 40-bottle wine cooler.

Gallagher paid $2.5million for the pad, the New York Observer exclusively reported- $400,000 less than the list price.

A quick peep: Former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher has purchased this two-bedroom apartment in the New York landmark Essex House; here, the living room has plenty of space for entertaining

Room with a view: The apartment is across the street from the southern entrance to Central Park

Doubling up: The second bedroom will most certainly get a rocker overhaul

Notable: His apartment is in Essex House, an Art Deco landmark

The outspoken British rocker has been vocal over his distaste for the U.S., once telling Contact Music that ‘American gigs are soul-destroying,’ as ‘there are a lot of people eating pizza.’

Moving on up: Liam Gallagher, who was the frontman of Oasis, has a piece of Manhattan to call his own

However, he seems to have gotten over that sentiment.

The property was sold by Stribling’s Mary Ellen Cashman.

The Essex House, one of New York City’s many landmarks, serves as both a hotel and permanent residences.

It is immediately recognisable due to the neon sign on the roof 44 storeys  up that also reads ‘Essex House.’

Located on Central Park South between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, it sits squarely across the street from the southern edge of Central Park.

Gallagher’s two bedroom, two-and-a-half bathroom property comes complete with a modern kitchen, herringbone floors, a washer and dryer in the unit, as well as access to the residence’s health club and spa.

There is ample room for a dining area in the apartment’s living room.

Though his accommodations are decidedly modern, many other residences within Essex House maintain their original Art Deco styling.

The prime location puts the musician near Central Park, Columbus Circle, Carnegie Hall, The Russian Tea Room, and The Plaza Hotel, as well as dozens of elite dining establishments.

Unfortunately for Gallagher, there are two pizzerias within a two-block radius of his new apartment.

Party like a rock star: The modern kitchen has granite counter tops and a 40-bottle wine cooler

Nice digs: The lobby of Essex House features checked marble and recessed lighting; there's also a 24-hour concierge service

Sweeping view: The Essex House, at 160 Central Park South, was designed by architect Frank Grad and opened in 1930; here, its famed neon sign can be seen along with part of Manhattan's skyline
