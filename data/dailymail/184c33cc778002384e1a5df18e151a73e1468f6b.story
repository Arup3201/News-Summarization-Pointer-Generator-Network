The U.S. State Department has defended spending $400,000 on a life-size sculpture of a camel staring through the eye of an over-sized needle for its embassy in Pakistan, claiming that the price of the artwork was ‘reasonable’ and it reflected ‘the values of a predominantly Islamist country’.

The work is by noted American artist 
John Baldessari, and depicts a New Testament and Qur'an phrase about the
 difficulty those who are wealthy have in entering heaven.

The white fibreglass sculpture appropriately named 'Camel Contemplating Needle' costs more than 320 times what the average Pakistan citizen earns in a year.

The taxpayer expense for the camel was found on the contracting documents, which consisted of four pages justifying a 'sole source' procurement for the sculpture.

It says: 'This artist's product is uniquely qualified.

'Public art which will be presented in the new embassy should reflect the values of a predominantly Islamist country.'

The document justifies the use of artist John Baldessari in the four page contracting document by citing his Wikipedia entry, which said: 'John Anthony Baldessari (born June 17, 1931) is an American conceptual 
artist known for his work featuring found photography and appropriated 
images.'

The U.S State Department's press spokeswoman, Christine Foushee, said: 'The proposed purchase comes from the department’s “Office of Art in 
Embassies.”

'In new construction projects, a small part of the 
total funds, about 0.5%, is spent on art purchases.'

The statue, 'Camel Contemplating Needle' will be featured outside of the new U.S. embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan, which will replace the old embassy (pictured)

Steven Beyer, of Beyer projects, the art dealer for the project, told BuzzFeed that the U.S. government reached out to his company.

He said: 'They approached us. We were, of course, quite surprised.

'The $400,000 price tag is actually a very a reduced price for this 
sculpture, there is an art market that makes these prices, 
and this is one of the most prominent American artists.

'It depends on what part of the public you are in...if you go 
to the museum and enjoy art and are moved by it, things cost what they 
cost.'

Another version of the camel sculpture is on display at Hall Wines in California's Napa Velley, and sold for a lot more than the version in the U.S embassy in Pakistan.
