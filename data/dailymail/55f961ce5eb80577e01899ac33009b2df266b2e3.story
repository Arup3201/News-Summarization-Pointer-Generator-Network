Ronny Delia has revealed how a trans-Atlantic phone call to Scott Brown confirmed there would be no lingering issue between the Celtic captain and John Collins.

Speculation has surrounded their relationship given that Brown was part of the Hibernian squad when Collins was the victim of a dressing-room revolt in 2007.

A group of players reportedly met with chairman Rod Petrie to air grievances about his managerial methods before backing down and apologising.

Captain's orders: Brown has given Collins' appointment at Celtic his blessing after a phone call

Brown and Collins will now be reunited when Celtic pre-season training kicks off next week after Delia appointed the former Scotland midfielder as his assistant.

The Norwegian has already had an introductory chat with Brown, currently on holiday in Florida, and is confident any problems are no longer relevant.

‘I asked him, of course, about John but as he said it has been many years now and he’s a professional,’ said Deila.

‘Both of them are older and maybe brighter, as well.

‘It’s not going to be any problem. Of course, I’m the manager and it’s Scott and me who are going to have the most important dialogue.

‘I’ve spoken with some of the players and Scott was one of them as he is the captain of the team. He is a very important player for us and knows the club well. He’s looking forward to coming back, starting training and doing well for Celtic.

‘The players are also excited to know the new manager and who he is. It’s important I talked with some of the leaders in the group so they feel they are being seen and that I give them something.’

Deila is delighted to have Collins on board as he begins to shape his plans for Celtic, with John Kennedy also set for a backroom role.

‘He (Collins) is going to be my right hand,’ said Deila, who left Stromsgodset to take over at Parkhead 13 days ago.

‘He’s going to be involved a lot in everything we do and we’re going to talk about football, how we like to play. I need a good staff around me and he’s one of them. We also have a physical coach, scouting and so on. Everybody has to come in and feel a part of it.

‘In the beginning, John Kennedy is going to be a part of it. He’s a boy who has talent and he’s part of the club, what position we don’t know yet. I’m delighted he’s here. He gives me energy when I talk with him and that’s good.’
