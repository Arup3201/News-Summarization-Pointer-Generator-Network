It is 2013's most talked about television series and the nation was gripped as the mystery of a schoolboy's killing was solved.

But in what might be a huge disappointment to the millions who watched ITV's  blockbuster crime drama Broadchurch, it has emerged the second series may not feature any murders at all.

Viewers hit a peak of 9.3million on Monday as the murderer was 
eventually revealed to be Joe Miller - 
the husband of Olivia Colman's character, Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller.

It's back: ITV have confirmed that the hit show will return to screens for a second series - but it may not involve a murder, it has emerged

Denouement: Joe Miller was revealed as the killer of Danny Latimer in the finale of the show, which gripped 10million

But creator Chris Chibnall says that Broadchurch's second series will tell a 'very different story', apparently focusing on the shattered Dorset community rather than posing an old-fashioned murder mystery.

No clues: Creator Chris Chibnall would not give away any secrets today but said the second series would be very different

He has also said that the programme 'was never intended to be a whodunnit', insisting that he is more interested in exploring British rural life than creating puzzles for viewers to solve.

This has led to speculation that the follow-up to the successful first series will document the villagers' reactions to the revelations which have already been broadcast and will not set up a second murder to be investigated.

'I have a plan. I’m keeping it to myself for a while, but we
know what we're going to do,' Mr Chibnall said.

'It’s going to be a very different type of story and
hopefully it will be just as compelling and bold and I'm really looking forward
to doing it.

'It will take us a little while, but hopefully it will be
something that lives up to the first one.

'I can’t really say at the moment, we’ve kept our secrets so
deliberately on the first one and it’s worked well, so if you don’t mind we’ll
keep the secrets for a bit longer on the second one.'

MailOnline contacted ITV and asked whether the second series would be murder-less, with a spokesman saying: 'In the spirit of Broadchurch we're keeping our secrets close'.

Almost 9million armchair sleuths tuned in to see Broadchurch’s dramatic final episode.

But
while the show started with 8.8million viewers, it tailed off to 
7.9million after 15 minutes once Joe Miller was revealed as the killer 
of 11-year-old schoolboy Danny Latimer.

Disbelief: The Latimer family couldn't comprehend that their neighbour had murdered their son

A town shattered: Broadchurch residents gathered together to remember Danny, who was taken too soon

The
climax was kept such a closely guarded secret that only 29 people - all
of whom were cast, crew or executives - knew the identity of the killer
before the final episode.

Actor Matthew Gravelle, 37, admitted 
this week he left it as late as possible to go on the school run on the day after he was 
revealed as the murderer.

But parents were waiting at the schoolgates to see the TV killer in the flesh.

Matthew
said: 'I tried to leave it as late as possible before running up to the
school and dropping the children off and running back.

'A couple of parents stopped me to let me know they had known it was me - but no one tried to push me over.'
