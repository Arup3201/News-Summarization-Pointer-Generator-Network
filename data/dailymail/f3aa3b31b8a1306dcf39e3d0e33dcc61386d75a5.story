Yearbook quotes tend to prove over-ambitious or untrue, but for America's World Cup hero it was just about right.

'It will take a nation of millions to held me back' was the quote attributed to a youthful 'Timothy' Howard. In the end, it was a nation of 11.14million people - Belgium - that held back his, and the US' World Cup progress, after extra time.

And it seems Howard was always step to reach the pinnacle of sport - although perhaps not necessarily in football.

Yearbook: Howard is quoted as saying 'It will take a nation of millions to hold me back' - in the end it was one of 11.14 million, Belgium, who beat USA in the last-16

Alternative option: Howard could have ended up playing basketball, according to some reports

That's more like it: Howard plays football but on this occasion appears to be outfield

Howard's yearbook comment came upon graduating from North Brunswick High in 1997 and is a reference to Public Enemy's 'It Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back'.

He was voted 'Most Athletic' at his school and reports say he could have played basketball during his time in college.

But of course, Howard ended up becoming the USMNT 'keeper and unfortunately for him his Public Enemy-inspired prophecy came true - although Howard's 16 saves showed Belgium almost needed all of those 11.14 million people to get past him.

Howard had made a deal with his coach that he would would play in midfield for his senior year, giving him a break from the pressure of being the under-17 national team goalie.

He led his school to the league final which ended 0-0 and went to penalties. Everyone expected Howard to put on the gloves for the spot kicks as the best young 'keeper in the country.

But Howard stepped up in support of regular 'keeper JD Martin and said, 'JD is our goalkeeper. Heâ€™ll be in net for penalties.'

A nice gesture, but Howard's school lost 8-7 in the shootout.
