The man who assassinated Dr Martin Luther King Jr has been seen for the first time on footage newly restored 45 years after the civil rights leader's death.

The fascinating, historical clips from July 1968 show James Earl Ray in handcuffs sitting on an airplane in Tennessee after being extradited from London. He had fled the U.S. following the fatal shooting of Dr King three months earlier at a Memphis motel.

The grainy, black and white film has been released this week by Shelby County Register's office after being cleaned up using digital technology.

Unseen: Martin Luther King assassin James Earl Ray is read his rights by a police officer on the plane after being returned to Tennessee to face trial over the civil rights leader's murder

Captured: James Earl Ray is handled by police officers in custody in Tennessee after being extradited from London in July 1968 for the assassination of Martin Luther King

Watched: Ray is examined by a prison doctor in Tennessee in 1968 three months after Dr King was shot at a Memphis motel

Ray is filmed wearing a checked shirt and black-rimmed glasses while being roughly handled by police officers with his arms behind his back in handcuffs.

He is also seen sitting on the airplane on the runway as he is read his rights by a police officer. 

Ray was filmed being moved to a prison cell and later removing his shirt as he is examined by a prison doctor.

Also on the restored videotape are potential jurors for Ray's trial being filmed saying their names. Ray never faced trial because he pleaded guilty to the murder. 

Shelby County Register told NBC, who helped restore the footage, in a statement: 'It is believed that the personnel using the equipment were learning how to operate this technology as they recorded.

'As a result, the footage is not always as clear as we are accustomed to seeing today.'

Killer of the dream:  James Earl Ray was sentenced to 99 years for the death of Martin Luther King but later said he was not guilty of the assassination

Surrounded: Ray is marched to a prison cell by police officers and guards in 1968. He was sentenced to 99 years for Dr King's murder and died in prison in 1998

Glimpse of history: Also among the freshly restored clips are brief interviews with potential jurors if a trial of James Earl Ray had gone ahead. The prospective jurors were all men with only two African-Americans

James Earl Ray, a convict who had escaped from Missouri State prison, was arrested at Heathrow Airport in London two months after Dr King was shot dead.

Ray was attempting to flee the UK on a fake Canadian passport headed for Africa. He was extradited to Tennessee and charged with Dr King's murder.

He confessed on March 10, 1969 but later changed his story and said he had falsely confessed. Ray was sentenced to 99 years in Tennessee state penitentiary without his case going to trial.

He spent the rest of his life trying to achieve a jury trial but was never successful.

There have long been conspiracy theories surrounding Dr King's death. In 1997, the civil rights leader's son Dexter met with Ray and publicly supported his father's killer receiving a retrial.

Ray died in prison of liver failure following complications from kidney disease, aged 70 in 1998.
