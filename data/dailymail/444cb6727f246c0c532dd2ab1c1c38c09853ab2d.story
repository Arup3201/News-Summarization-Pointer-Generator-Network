He came within an inch of death in November when a 114kg tiger used him as a teething toy.

And just months after the terrifying ordeal that nearly cost Dave Styles his life, the experienced big cat handler has made the brave decision to to step back into the cage.

Styles has returned to work at Beerwah's Australia Zoo, set up by Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin's father Bob in 1970, where staff say he is thrilled to be back amongst the animals.

Terrifying: The moment Charlie the tiger launched at Australia Zoo big cat keeper Dave Styles in November. The mauling nearly killed him but Styles has returned to work

'He's back at work, he's happy, he's going great,' said an Australia Zoo spokeswoman.

He has been back working for 'some months' and is back in the 'exact same role'.

In a piece for the zoo's publication Crikey Magazine, Styles wrote that despite the terrifying experience, he still loved his huge stripey felines.

'The day that Charlie bit me, he became a little overexcited during his toy session and played a little too rough,' Styles wrote.

Catastrophic: Styles suffered puncture wounds to his neck and shoulders in the attack

Friendly hug: Experts say Charlie wasn't being vicious but 'overly excited'

'Charlie wasn’t intending to injure me and as soon as we had left the enclosure, he was calm and ­interacting with other handlers.

Mr Styles also thanked well wishers for their support and hoped tiger conservation would remain a priority among animal lovers.

I’d like to acknowledge all of the support and well wishes I received globally while I was in recovery,' he said.

'This went a long way to keep me motivated and assisted in my speedy recovery.

That's more like it: Styles has worked with big cats for more than nine years and said he hoped Charlie wasn't euthanised following the mauling

Seriously ill: Styles was flown to hospital with severe injuries

'Although this situation was an unfortunate incident, my hope is that it doesn’t distract from how these ­tigers are ambassadors to raise awareness towards conserving their wild cousins.'

The 30-year-old was dragged into the water and bitten on the neck by Charlie - a Sumatran-Bengal tiger - when he became 'over excited' during a feeding session.

Mr Styles had raised the big cat from a cub and was flown to Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital following the attack, where he was initially 'seriously ill'.

Frenzy: Dozens of horrified zoo visitors watched on as Charlie dragged the trainer into the water

The attack was witnessed by dozens of zoo visitors and captured by news crews who were filming at the time.

Shortly after the attack, Mr Styles said he did not want Charlie to be euthanised.

In a statement to MailOnline, the zoo confirmed Charlie avoided that fate and that he had been reunited with his human friend.

'Dave is doing well and he’s back at work with Australia Zoo’s tigers including Charlie. We’re all moving forward and focusing on doing what we love, which is tiger & wildlife conservation,' the statement read.
