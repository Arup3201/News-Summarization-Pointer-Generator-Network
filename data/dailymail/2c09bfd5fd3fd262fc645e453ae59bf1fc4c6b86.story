Help: Treasury minister Sajid Javid, pictured, hinted a minimum wage rise would soon be given the green light

The cost to businesses of a big hike in the minimum wage would be offset with tax breaks under plans being drawn up by Conservative ministers.

Further cuts to corporation tax or an increase in National Insurance relief could help firms contend with an expected rise in the minimum pay rate.

Business leaders broadly back raising the rate, but say it could be hard to implement.

Treasury minister Sajid Javid yesterday gave a clear signal that the move, designed to help struggling workers reap the rewards of Britain’s economic recovery, is likely to be given the green light.

The minimum wage is £6.31 for over-21s, but in real terms it is now worth the same as in 2004 – and is about ten per cent lower than 2008.

Analysis for Downing Street suggests hiking the minimum pay rate by 50p an hour would also save the Government as much as £1billion, because people in work would pay more tax and claim less in benefits.

Independent advisers have been asked to look at restoring the value of the rate, which has been undermined since the crash of 2008 and 2009.

Mr Javid told the BBC’s Daily Politics programme that there was a strong case for a rise.

‘The Department of Business has asked the Low Pay Commission to look into this. They’re going to report back shortly and we’ll see what they come up with,’ he said.

‘It [the minimum wage] is about 10 per cent lower in real terms than where it was in 2008. I think that’s a strong case to look at it.

'The important thing is that the right people to look at this decision are the Low Pay Commission.’

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: ‘One of the things we tried to do is support hard-working people, it’s been one of the key planks of our long-term economic plan.

‘We’ve supported the minimum wage and 
actually it’s looked at by the Low Pay Commission, so there’s been an 
independent body that’s looked at that – I think that’s the right thing 
to do.

‘But I think we’ve been very clear as a government that we want to see work pay.

‘I think we’ve absolutely  targeted our help on the people on the lowest incomes.’

Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who led a successful campaign to persuade the Chancellor to freeze fuel duty until 2015, said: ‘Although I would like to see it increase with the current level of inflation, I recognise that a significant rise could put jobs at risk, as many small businesses would be unable to afford a rise.

'I believe it is important that we look at the other ways of giving people a living wage, namely cutting people’s taxes and letting them keep more of their salary.’

John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘With confidence returning to most sectors, it makes sense to look at increasing the minimum wage.

‘However, we would urge the Government to tread carefully. In some industries, such as retail and social care, small businesses operate very fine margins and are struggling with rising costs.

‘It is for this reason we have argued that any increase in the national minimum wage this year should not exceed the rate of inflation.’

The Commission’s report is due to be handed to ministers at the end of next month.
