A city's police force which was tasked to weed out the abuse of vulnerable women has arrested 54 people in just a month.

Officers in Newcastle set up Operation Sanctuary to comb through taxi firms, B&Bs and takeaways to find people who have been sexually exploited.

Since the launch they have already identified around 80 women and girls who may be victims.

Twenty-seven people - 25 men and two women - were arrested in the first week at the end of last month and the tip-offs have been coming in steadily since, a Northumbria Police spokesman said.

One man has been charged with raping an underage girl after allegations emerged as part of the operation.

Abdul Jelilou Ouro Kefia, 21, from Walker, Newcastle, was charged with one count of rape of a female under 16 after the alleged incident on February 17.

He appeared at Newcastle Magistratesâ€™ Court on February 19 where he was remanded in custody.

The operation is continuing visits to taxi firms, hotels, B&Bs, and takeaways in the Newcastle area.

The force covers Newcastle and the surrounding countryside and towns in Northumbria.

Deputy Chief Constable Steve Ashman said: 'Operation Sanctuary has expanded to embrace all crimes of a sexual nature on vulnerable female victims. All victims are dealt with sensitively by our specially trained officers and we take decisive action against suspected offenders.

'A recent example of this heightened public vigilance is a report we received from a concerned member of the public who saw what appeared to be an intoxicated woman in a park and who called us.

'Officers attended and ensured she was safe. This is exactly what we want the public to do to help us to protect vulnerable women.

He added: 'We are working closely with our local communities and partner agencies to raise awareness of this important issue and encourage people to report the sexual exploitation of women and girls.

'We need the public to assist us with the investigation and I'd urge people to be vigilant and pass on any information they think could help us with our enquiries.

'Specially trained officers are continuing to work with and support the victims we have identified so far and I would like to praise their courage in coming forward and speaking to us.

'I want to reassure our communities that we are doing all we can to identify offenders and I'd ask anyone who thinks they may be a victim, regardless of how long ago the offence may have taken place, to come forward and speak to us.'
