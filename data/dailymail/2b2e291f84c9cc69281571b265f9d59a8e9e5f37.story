They call it 'the place where stars are born' and a glance at the cast of notable graduates confirms that is no idle boast.

The Toulon Tournament is maybe unique, given it is not affiliated to UEFA or FIFA, entry is by invitation only and games are 80 minutes long. But its propensity for being a breeding ground for world-class players, like Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry and Cristiano Ronaldo is beyond dispute.

It is a competition that was also once part of England’s fabric. They were victorious four times between 1990 and 1994 — Sportsmail’s Jamie Redknapp captained one successful squad, while Alan Shearer and David Beckham also played — and on Thursday night, after a nine-year absence, a team of Young Lions will set out to prove they can be the names of tomorrow.

Challenge: Nathan Redmond and his England Under-21 colleagues will take part in the prestigious Toulon Tournament

In some respects, it is fitting England’s opponents are Qatar as it will be in the Middle East, in 2022, that many of the youngsters in Gareth Southgate’s 20-man squad will be at their peak when the ambition, mapped out by FA chairman Greg Dyke, is to conquer the world.

That, of course, is a dream but the reality of the next two weeks is that this is a crucial part of their development, one that will provide a number of different tests. After Qatar, England face holders Brazil, South Korea and last year’s finalists Colombia. Put simply, England could do everything that Southgate asks of them but it still might not be enough to get out of Group B.

‘The chairman has gone on record saying he wants us to be a force at the World Cup in 2022,’ said Southgate. ‘We will be looking at the lads here to form the nucleus of that squad.Our players will get to experience all the things that come with playing tournament football against teams from all over the world.

‘Of course, we want to go and win but, if we don’t, the learning side of things is invaluable.’ 

Southgate stresses that point and it is 
little wonder. England’s Under-21s have sauntered through their Euro 
2015 qualifying group, winning seven of their eight games with little 
fuss, but each one has been the same: England attack, opponents sit deep
 and hope to hold out for as long as possible.

Many will expect Qatar to do the same but a glance at their squad suggests England will be in for a shock if they are complacent.

Abdullah Ali, for instance, is on Real Madrid’s books; Tameem Al Muhaza is with Atletico Madrid, Sultan Al Blake plays for Monaco, while four Qataris are at Villarreal.

‘It will be really interesting to play them,’ said Southgate. ‘They are quite free in how they play but if we take liberties we will get punished. Qatar have investment and they are building a side for 2022.’

As are England. The journey starts now.
