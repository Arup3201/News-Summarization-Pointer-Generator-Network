A 14-year-girl has been found dead inside a hot car where temperatures reached 130 degrees after faulty locks apparently left her trapped inside.

Graciela Martinez was found dead in the backseat of her brother's BMW outside Madera South High School in Madera, California on Wednesday, hours after he had gone inside to class.

He drove his sister to school that morning and left her alone in the vehicle because he had a 6.40am class while her first lesson began at 7.40am. She had no cellphone, food or water with her.

When he and another sister finished classes at the end of the day, they found Graciela white and unresponsive in the back seat. ABC30 reported that she was covered in sweat.

Tragic: Graciela Martinez, pictured, was found dead in the back of her brother's car after he parked it outside their school. Police are trying to determine if she died after getting locked inside

Her brother rushed her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead. Staff alerted police.

Authorities have discovered that there could be a problem with the locks on the 1997 BMW, preventing her from getting out, ABC 30 reported.

When the door is locked with the key from the outside, someone inside may not be able to get out.

'It
appears there may be a defective locking system on the car but we are 
still need to do further tests to determine if that's true and correct,'
Madera police detective Sgt. Robert Salas said.

Detectives also discovered that the horn does not work if there is no key is in the ignition.

They
are still investigating exactly what led to her death but her family 
said she had no health conditions and that she was healthy on the day 
she went to school.

Trapped: Police found that someone can not get out of the 1997 BMW, pictured, if it's locked from outside and that the horn does not work if there are no keys in the ignition

Scene: She was in the car parked outside Madera South High and may have initially been sleeping

Parking lot: Her sister found her body in the parked car and they rushed her to hospital - but it was too late

Police said preliminary investigations did not show she had made any attempts to get out. Friends said that Graciela was petite and reserved and could have been waiting for help to arrive.

Salas said investigators are still waiting for autopsy results to determine how she died.

Madera Unified Superintendent Ed Gonzalez said the temperature in the car when the teenager was found exceeded 130 degrees.

Detectives are looking at all 'possible possibilities' to determine how she died, Salas said, calling the case 'very, very troubling and very puzzling'.

'At this stage of the investigation it appears that heat may have played
a role in her death,' he said. 'But an underlying medical condition may be 
discovered once further medical examination is performed.

Distraught: Graciela's brother and sister, who found their younger sister's body, said she was a hard worker

Remembered: Her family held a candle-lit vigil at their home which included some of her favorite items

'There does not
appear to be anything criminal in nature at this stage of the 
investigation.'

At a news conference on Thursday, Madera Unified School District Superintendent Edward Gonzalez offered condolences to the girl's family and warned about the dangers of staying in hot vehicles.

Counselors were at Madera South High on Thursday to help students and staff deal with the tragedy.

Her sister Patricia told ABC30: 'She would get good grades in school, she wouldn't get in trouble or anything. I don't know why this happened to her.'

Salas added that Martinez's family are farmworkers and will struggle to pay for her funeral. Donations for the family can be made to Wells Fargo Bank, account: 9343817004
