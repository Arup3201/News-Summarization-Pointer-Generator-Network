The parents of a toddler with cerebral palsy have told how they face a desperate battle to raise tens of thousands of pounds to pay for him to have life-changing surgery.

Oliver Osborne, two, needs pioneering surgery to enable him to walk, but the operation is not  funded by the NHS.

His parents, Sallyanne, 38, and Terry, 36, must now raise £60,000 to pay for him to have the operation at either Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital, Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, or Leeds General Infirmary.

Oliver Osborne, two, has spastic diplegic cerebral palsy which means he will not be able to walk without a frame unless he has pioneering surgery which is not available on the NHS

Without the surgery, the best they can hope for Oliver is that he will be able to walk with the help of a frame.

‘The surgery would give Oliver the chance for a normal life – I can’t put into words how much it would mean for him,’ Mrs Osborne, from Fareham in Hampshire, told MailOnline.

Oliver was born almost 12 weeks early in January 2011 weighing just 2lbs 12oz.

He spent seven weeks in hospital during which time he spent weeks in intensive care and he developed the hospital superbug MRSA.

Mrs Osborne said: ‘At the time it was the scariest experience. It was described to us by those at the hospital as the biggest rollercoaster you will ever ride, but we got through it.

‘We spent hours staring at monitors willing him to get better.’

Oliver (pictured with his mother, Sallyanne) needs Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy surgery which, until recently, was only available in the U.S.

Oliver has recently learnt to stand up with his walking frame but is yet to learn how to walk with it. Without surgery his parents fear he will never be able to play with the other children at school or to ride a bike

Oliver, who has an older sister, Millie, four, was eventually allowed to leave hospital March but he suffered severe reflux meaning he was unsettled and was sick about every hour and a half.

He grew out of the reflux but as autumn arrived, he began to develop regular bouts of bronchiolitis – a lower respiratory tract infection.

By November 2011, Oliver’s parents, who both work for Virgin Atlantic as on board managers, started to realise something was not right.

Mrs Osborne said: ‘We started to realise that Oliver wasn’t really doing anything.

Oliver was born almost 12 weeks early in January 2011. When he was born, he weighed just 2lbs 12oz

Oliver spent seven weeks in hospital during which time he spent weeks in intensive care and he developed the hospital superbug MRSA

‘He was such a happy little man but all he could do was lie on the floor on his back.

‘He couldn’t roll or sit up like other children and hated spending time on his front - he just screamed.

‘We were told by so many people it was just developmental delay and he was just a lazy boy.

‘After months of pushing from us we finally got him to see a physio, and she started to tell us how concerned she was about muscle tone but it really meant nothing to us.’

Oliver (pictured with his mother) was released from hospital when he was seven-weeks-old but just months later his parents realised he was not developing normally as he had not learnt to roll over or sit up

Oliver was eventually diagnosed when a physiotherapist expressed concern about his muscle tone and his parents took him to see a different consultant

Then, in April 2012, Oliver saw a new consultant who finally diagnosed him with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy and his parents were told he might never walk.

Mrs Osborne said: ‘We knew something wasn’t quite right but never in our wildest dreams, or should I say nightmares, did we expect to hear that.

‘You go through so many feelings after being told something like that but after a while you pick yourselves up and get on with life again.’

Since his diagnosis, Oliver has been having regular physiotherapy and, as a result, has now leant to roll over, sit up on his own, and crawl.

Mrs Osborne said: 'We knew something wasn't quite right but never in our wildest dreams, or should I say nightmares, did we expect to hear that'

Mrs Osborne said: 'Life can be so frustrating for him, all he wants to do is join in with other children, scoot, play on a bike and kick a ball. This operation will give him the chance to do this.' Oliver is pictured with his sister, Millie, four

However, to be able to walk without a frame, he needs Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy surgery.

This is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs.

It involves opening the lower vertebrae to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system.

These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body.

During the procedure, electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves.

This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut.

These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body.

Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves.

This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut.

Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic.

Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs.

Following the surgery, months of intensive physiotherapy is required to help the child walk.

The surgery and subsequent physiotherapy cost up to £60,000.

Until recently, the operation was only available in the U.S. and Mr and Mrs Osborne are aware that, even now, Oliver may need to travel to America to have the surgery.

Funding is not routinely offered by the NHS.

Dr Stuart Ward, Medical Director for the Wessex Area Team at NHS England said: 'We sympathise with patients and families who feel they may benefit from this treatment, however, Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) is not routinely funded by the NHS as the current evidence base does not yet demonstrate sufficient clinical and cost effectiveness for its routine use.

'It has been identified by clinicians and patient representatives as showing significant "promise" as a potential treatment option for the future and forms part of the Commissioning through Evaluation programme.

'The Commissioning through Evaluation programme, which was originally developed with clinicians treating heart conditions, will enable SDR, and other appropriate services and/or treatments, to be funded within defined parameters, in a small number of participating centres, and within an explicit evaluation programme.'

Mrs Osborne said: ‘Life can be so frustrating for him, all he wants to do is join in with other children, scoot, play on a bike and kick a ball. This operation will give him the chance to do this.’

She told MailOnline: ‘After the surgery he would have some sort of normal life. He could play with the other children – it would be completely different.

‘At the moment he can only crawl – this operation will remove so many restrictions in his life.

‘It will give him less pain in the future and will mean he faces less frustration. It will be absolutely massive for him.

‘Now, the idea of him being able to walk, and even maybe run a little bit, is inconceivable.’

Mr and Mrs Osborne are raising money for Oliver’s treatment through the charity Tree of Hope which helps families raise money for medicines, surgery and treatment which are not available on the NHS.

Any money that is left over after Oliver has had his surgery will go to help other sick children.

The couple are planning a golf day and also a ball to raise money for the surgery which they hope Oliver will be able to have at the beginning of next summer.

Oliver’s four-year-old sister, Millie, is running the 1.5km Mini Great South Run to help with the fundraising.
