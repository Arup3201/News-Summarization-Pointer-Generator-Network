Thoughts: Osama bin Laden struggled to command the attention of his far-flung terror network

Osama Bin Laden urged followers not to 'waste our effort' with attacks on Britain, but to focus exclusively on defeating America.

He plotted to bring down a plane carrying President Obama, claiming it would mean the accession of vice-president Joe Biden, who was 'utterly unprepared' for the job.

The revelations emerged in a cache of letters and documents recovered from Bin Laden's hideout in Pakistan and released online yesterday, a year after his death in a raid by US Navy SEALs.

They offer a rare insight into his thinking, with one letter drafted just a week before he died.

Bin Laden was clear he saw America as his overriding terror target.

'Even though we have the chance to attack the British, we should not waste our effort to do so but concentrate on defeating America, which will lead to defeating the others, God Willing,' he wrote.

'Any arrow and mine we have should be directed against Americans, disregarding all other enemies, including Nato, and concentrating on Americans only.'

And his prime target was President Obama.

Bin Laden ordered two units to be set up, in Pakistan and Bagram, Afghanistan – the home of a major US base – to attack aircraft carrying Mr Obama and his vice-president.

He clearly wanted gaffe-prone Mr Biden in the White House and said 'the killing…would have a serious impact on the course of the war' because Mr Obama was 'the man of this phase'.

He ruled out targeting Robert Gates, then US defence secretary or Admiral Mike Mullen, then chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff.

But he made it clear Mr Biden was to remain unharmed, so lowly did he rate the vice-president.

Bin Laden insisted that if Al Qaeda 
fighters came across a convoy of American, Afghan and Nato troops, 'we 
should choose to ambush the American army vehicles, even though the 
American army vehicles have the least amount of soldiers'.

Fox News: '(Fox News) channel... falls into the abyss as you know, and lacks neutrality too.... Let her die in her anger.'

CNN: .As for the neutrality of CNN in English, it seems to be in cooperation with the government more than the others (except Fox News of course).'

ABC News: 'ABC channel is all right; actually it could be one of the best channels, as far as we are concerned. It is interested in al-Qaeda issues, particularly the journalist Brian Ross, who is specialized in terrorism. The channel is still proud for its interview with the [bin Laden]. It also broadcasted excerpts from a speech of [Gadahn's] on the fourth anniversary.'

CBS News: 'I see that it is like the other channels, but it has a famous program (60 Minutes) that has some popularity and a good reputation for its long broadcasting time.'

MSNBC: 'I used to think that MSNBC channel may be good and neutral a bit, but is has lately fired two of the most famous journalists - Keith Olberman and Octavia Nasser the Lebanese.'

He explained: 'The only time you are 
allowed to attack the other army vehicles is if those vehicles are going
 to attack our brothers.'

In the same undated letter, Bin Laden wrote: 'We want to cut the tree at the root.

'The problem is that our strength is limited, so our best way to cut the tree is to concentrate on sawing the trunk of the tree.

'Here is an example for you, the 
mujahidin were able to cut the root of the Russian tree, and after that,
 all the branches fell off one after the other.'

In another missive written on October 
21 2010, Bin Laden relished the economic problems hurting the West. He 
said America was in 'big trouble' in Afghanistan and 'their financial 
crisis continues'.

'Britain has lowered its defence 
budget and America is reducing the budget of the Pentagon. Anyone who 
knows the world and knows politics knows it is impossible for them to 
continue with the war,' he states. There are also two references to 
Britain in a letter dated April 26, 2011.

Addressed to Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, who
 became Al Qaeda's number two after the death of his boss, Bin Laden 
claimed Britain was looking for a way out of Afghanistan 'if Al Qaeda 
promised not to target their interests'.

The documents have been published by 
the Combating Terrorism Centre, a privately-funded research organisation
 based at the US Military Academy at West Point.
