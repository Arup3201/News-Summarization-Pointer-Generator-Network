A mother racked up £45,000 in debt and maxed out five credit cards after becoming addicted to online bingo while she was off work sick. 

Kelly Nield, 32, would gamble for eight hours at a time and drained all the money she and her boyfriend had saved up together.

Her addiction became so bad that she began to have suicidal thoughts and turned to self harm after worrying about how she would ever escape the habit.

Mother-of-one Ms Nield, from Billinge, Merseyside, said: 'You get to the point where you can't see a way out.

'It's a vicious cycle as when you win get the buzz to play again, and when you lose you just want to get your money back.

'I just wanted to find a way to make myself stop and when my thoughts turned dark I knew I had to get help.'

She first stumbled across bingo while watching The Jeremy Kyle Show when she was signed off sick from her job as a childcare worker in 2012.

Foxy Bingo was advertised with a bright, brash logo on the daytime television show, luring Ms Nield in before she went on to use other sites too.

'You can go on and do it in your own home in comfort and to begin with it's not a big deal,' she said.

'I'd been to bingo with friends in the past but not spent more than about £20. It had never been an issue before.

'But they always let you win something to begin with or offer you free plays. In just over six months, I was £10,000 in debt.' 

Ms Nield's online bingo habit quickly spiralled out of control, and the first thing she would turn to in the morning was her smartphone, where she could get her kick within seconds.

She said: 'I would gamble from the second my family left in the morning until they came home at night, and when they were home I would sneak off to the bathroom and bedroom to play.

'My partner would come home and comment that the house hadn't been touched and it was because I'd be sat on it all day, gambling.

'For the first two years I put everything on credit cards. Because I was off and suffering with stress, I don't really remember it. I think I was just blocking out what was going on

'I know the difference between right and wrong so now I think what on earth was I doing.'

The mother took out more credit cards, arranged more overdrafts on her bank account and began to dip into the family's savings.

'I've ended up with five credit cards in total - one for £10,000 and the others all have around £5,000 on them,' she said.

'I'd maxed them all out by the end of 2013 and then until the middle of 2014 I was using any cash I could get my hands on.

'I managed to get a £1,600 overdraft on one of my accounts and I just spent it.

'My partner and I were saving around £500 a month and I would just access the accounts and spend what I could. Now we're left without any savings at all.'

Eventually she came clean to her boyfriend Ian Nairn, 37, and she started seeing a doctor to help her tackle her addiction.

Now Ms Nield, who is paying off £300 of debt a month, is now calling on the gambling industry to rein in its adverts, which are aired on television throughout the day.

She said: 'They target vulnerable people and make them believe they can make money from gambling.

'I understand some people gamble and have no issues. But many people have a problem and this destroys lives, families and even drives people to suicide.

'It destroys people and leaves them with long term debts, depression and stress.

'No-one gives you anything for nothing in this world and something needs to be done about it.'

Dirk Hanson, CEO of gambling support charity Gamcare, said: 'We applaud people who come forward and admit that they have a problem with gambling.

'We encourage people to get support either for themselves or for family members or friends who might be struggling.

'There is help available out there either through support groups or through one-on-one counselling.

'We know that women in particular are drawn to online forms of gambling and they are more likely to access these services online.

'We offer an online chat service through our helping where people can anonymously come through and chat with one of our advisors.

'It is a reality that people can get hooked on these websites, and people should be fully aware of the risks before getting too involved.'
