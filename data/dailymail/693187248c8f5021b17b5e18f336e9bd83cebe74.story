He has risked his life fighting in warzones around the world.

But soldier Steven Grey has swapped the heat and dust of the frontline for serving the rich and famous at one of the world's most opulent hotels.

The 45-year-old, a former warrant officer in the Royal Army Physical Training Corps, has ditched his military uniform for that of a butler and now works at the iconic Savoy in London.

Instead of carrying an Army-issue assault rifle and 60lb backpack, Steven is now found carrying tea-trays laden with fine china and cutting the finest cigars to cater for the every whim of guests staying at the lavish hotel where rooms cost up to £12,000 a night.

He is famously discreet about guests who include royalty, world leaders and stars of stage and screen.

'A good butler never talks what he sees,' he says. But the star status of many who stay at the Savoy is undoubted. Famous former guests include Sir Winston Churchill, Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe.

A normal shift will see Steven him acting as a Jeeves-style personal butler for guests staying in 20 suites. His duties include being a personal shopper, secretarial tasks and a travel consultant.

A career amid the elegance of the Savoy is a far cry from his time in the Army when the married former soldier served on the frontline.

A veteran of more than 20 years, Steven joined the Royal Engineers straight from school and then transferred to the physical training corps.

He ran adventurous training packages and was later in charge of the rest and recuperation centre during the Iraq conflict in July 2003 where he came under shell fire.

Training: Steven had always dreamed of running his own hotel so enrolled at the International Butler Academy in Holland to learn the trade

He said: 'It was pretty dangerous 
because all the enemy had run away when the mission began in March, but 
by the summer they'd regrouped and were coming back.

'On a tour of duty troops can't let their physical fitness drop so we'd go around bases setting them up with gym equipment.

'I had to organise three-day packages 
for the soldiers so they could chill out and relax, doing whatever they 
wanted - shopping, swimming, sunbathing. Then when they were refreshed 
it was back to the frontline where they were getting mortared and shot 
at.'

By June 2012, Steven 
had suffered a hip injury and decided he wanted to do 'something a 
little more sedate where I wasn't running around with a pack on my 
back.'

He had always dreamed
 of running his own hotel so to learn the trade he enrolled at the 
International Butler Academy in a 14th Century castle in Holland.

He
 said: 'I thought I'd just breeze through the course but it was like a 
military-style boot camp. They managed to break a lot of guys.

Past experience: Steven in his Mess Kit in 1994

'There was sleep deprivation, long hours, non-stop work and rigorous inspections. It was just like basic training in the Army.

'It
 was hard but once I'd left the course with my diploma you realise they 
were being harsh to be kind. It was perfect for training you how to deal
 with the most awkward guests.'

During
 the eight-week course the aspiring butler took lessons in flower 
arranging and was taught how to produce table decorations, serve a 
seven-course dinner and hold an umbrella correctly to keep dignitaries 
dry in a downpour.

He mastered 25 different ways of folding a napkin as well as the spectacular art of opening champagne bottles with a sabre.

'The course taught me how to run an entire household from top to bottom,' he said.

Once
 he had his diploma Steven, from Darlington, County Durham, put his 
new-look CV on a recruitment website and it caught the impressed eye of 
the head butler at the Savoy.

In August he was offered a job at the hotel, which opened in 1889 and boasts 195 guest rooms and 73 suites.

He said: 'It was a little bit 
overwhelming because of the magnificent reputation of the hotel. If you 
mention the Savoy anywhere in the world, people instantly recognise it.

'I started to doubt myself but the military training I've had over the years taught me how to handle the pressure.

'It
 is the best place to work - it has incredibly high standards, an 
amazing history and so many stars have stayed here over the years It's 
unbelievable.'

Steven, who is married to Rachel, 40, a
 major in the Army's Education Training Services, said it was hard work 
trying to meet the demands of guests while maintaining an unruffled 
exterior.

He said: 'You are expected to have knowledge of the fineries of the world and are virtually a PA for the guests.

'They may ask where the best restaurants are or they might want tickets for a show or just to sit and chat.'

We are here to make sure their stay is as comfortable as possible and they get everything they need.

'Each guest expects you to be their 
own personal butler so you need to be there. you are on call 24 hours a 
day. If a guest says at 2am, "I fancy some salmon on toast" then you're 
expected to get it.

'Nothing illegal, obviously, but the priority is to keep the guest happy. It's a full time job and can be quite exhausting.'

In one test recently Steven walked eight miles in a single shift climbing stairs from the cellars to the suites.

He spoke to the Mail in the plush surroundings of the Royal Suite, a luxurious apartment occupying the front of the fifth floor that boasts spectacular views of the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament.

Despite being a completely different world from the Army, Steven said his career in uniform had given him ideal skills to become a butler.

He said: 'Organisation is the key to everything. I’m dealing with 20 rooms, all of which will have different requests, so you have to be fast and learn how to prioritise.

'All these skills applied in the military as they do in civvy street. I'm used to working under pressure and as part of a team as you do in the Army.

'You won't see me lose my cool or my temper. If something needs to be done, I'll put it in order.'

Steven
 believes it is vital that serving soldiers recognise the skills they 
have learned in the military are valuable in 'civvy street', especially 
when the Ministry of Defence is axing 30,000 troops to save money.

Equally, he thinks employers need to 
'break through the perception that soldiers are just running around a 
battlefield shooting people'.

The Army recruits people in countless roles, from engineers and drivers to dentists and teachers.

Steven says he occasionally feels starstruck when bumping into a celebrity in the hotel.

He said: 'You sometimes feel a little bit overwhelmed when you see someone who is famous but it's my job not to show it,' he said.

'You stay professional and look after them as you would any guest. When you walk out of the room into the corridor you might say "Woah" but the mask never slips.'
