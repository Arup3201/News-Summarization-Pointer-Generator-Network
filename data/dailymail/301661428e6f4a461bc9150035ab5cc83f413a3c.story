The airline executive whose 'nut rage' delayed an international flight today tried to apologise to two flight attendants - but they weren't in.

Heather Cho visited the homes of the two cabin crew to beg forgiveness for her actions aboard a Korean Air flight from New York to Seoul. 

Both were out, BBC News reported. She left each a note instead.

Chastened: Miss Cho, who until last week had been chief of in-flight service for Korean Air, caused a Korean Air flight to be delayed after she flew into a rage when she was served macadamia nuts in a bag

Miss Cho, who until the incident had been chief of in-flight service for Korean Air, caused flight KE086 to be delayed after she flew into a rage when she was served macadamia nuts in a bag. 

Korean Air protocol is for the nuts to be served on a small dish. Head steward Park Chang-jin claims Miss Cho insulted him and forced him to kneel in apology.

'In a situation where she said 'Make contacts right now to stop the plane. I won't let the plane go', I dared not object to her, the owner's daughter,' he told Korean state-run TV network KBS on Friday

The pilot brought the plane back to its gate at John F. Kennedy International Airport for the chief steward to be expelled.

The flight's arrival at Incheon Airport, near Seoul, was delayed by 11 minutes as a result.

Miss Cho is the eldest daughter of the company chairman Cho Yang-ho. Two siblings are also executives at the airline. 

Mr Park claims she swore at him, jabbed him with a file case and pointed her finger at him as he kneeled.

The plane was already in the process taxiing to the runway for a 12.50am departure, but returned to the passenger terminal after Miss Cho demanded the chief steward's removal from the flight.

'The chief flight attendant failed to get the right manual, and this led Cho to believe he was not qualified for that job,' a Korean Air official told the Korean Times last week.

Disgrace: Miss Cho has been stripped of all titles at the airline and its affiliates, and faces investigation by the government and prosecutors to determine whether she breached aviation laws

The incident - first reported on Monday - has stoked both mirth and anger in South Korea, whose economy is dominated by powerful family-run conglomerates known as chaebol.

Miss Cho has been stripped of all titles at the airline and its affiliates, and faces investigation by the government and prosecutors to determine whether she breached aviation laws.

She bowed and offered a public apology before being questioned at the transport ministry in Seoul on Friday.

Speaking to reporters hours after being questioned, Miss Cho declined to respond to the cabin crew chief's account of the incident.

'I have no idea... I have never heard of it,' Miss Cho said.
