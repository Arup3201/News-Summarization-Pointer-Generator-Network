Barcelona slumped off the top of La Liga with a shock home defeat by Celta Vigo as Real Madrid cruised to an 11th consecutive win.

Luis Suarez made his debut at the Nou Camp but couldn’t guide Barcelona, who struck the woodwork four times, to a crucial win as they relinquished top spot.

‘What a blow!’ claimed Spanish paper Sport, describing Luis Enrique’s side as a ‘Barcelona team without creation’.
