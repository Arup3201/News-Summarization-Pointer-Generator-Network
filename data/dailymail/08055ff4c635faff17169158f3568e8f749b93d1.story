A New Jersey woman charged with throwing her emaciated pit bull puppy down a garbage shoot leaving it for dead has been denied a pre-trial intervention program most likely sending her trial.

Kisha Curtis, 29, called the Newark judge's decision 'aggravating' after her motion's denial which would have offered her an alternative to the traditional justice process, NJ.com reports.

She previously rejected prosecutors' plea deal which would have sentenced her to 18-months in prison for the disturbing crime that took place more than two years ago.

Abuse: Kisha Curtis, 29, left, has denied ever abusing the dog since named Patrick, right, after it was found a day before St Patrick’s day at the bottom of a trash cute in 2011 weighing only 19lbs

Recovery: Patrick the pit bull is seen during his recovery in the days after Curtis says she merely left him in the hallway without ever abusing him

Curtis has denied ever abusing the dog since named Patrick, after he was found a day before St Patrick’s day in 2011 weighing a shocking 19lbs.

She maintains that she left the puppy in a hallway before it was found by someone else in the bottom of a trash shoot bone thin, curled in a ball and near death.

The dog has since miraculously made a full recovery while now weighing a remarkable 50lbs after discovered moments before the trash compactor would have killed him.

As Curtis exited the courtroom following the judge's decision she told a reporter 'everything happens for a reason.'

What a difference! Patrick is seen more recently appearing healthy and strong after taken in by a Tinton Falls veterinary facility giving him a new live

If the judge had permitted Curtis a pre-trial intervention program its completion would have scraped any record showing her conviction as well as provide early resolution of her case. The program’s offering is usually reserved for first offenders, with Curtis previously having no crime record.

Volunteers from the Associated Humane Societies have since filed a civil suit seeking ownership of Patrick. The organization first took him to the emergency room at Garden State Veterinary Specialists.

Patrick currently lives with Patricia Smillie-Scavelli, an administrator of the Tinton Falls veterinary facility where the dog was first treated.

While the obviously horrific trauma the dog ensured as seen from some of the first pictures revealed inevitably left emotional and physical scarring, those who know Patrick talk only of how loving and trusting he is.

Heartbreaking: Patrick was at death's door when he was taken to the emergency room at Garden State Veterinary Specialists in Tinton Fall, New Jersey and few thought he would survive

Miraculous: A year later, his carer and hospital administrator Patricia Smillie-Scavelli says he gives enormous love and sleeps in bed with her, her husband and their cat

'He is a tremendous fighter,' said Dr
Thomas Scavelli, the director and founder of the Garden State 
Veterinary Specialists, the pet hospital in Tinton Falls where Patrick 
has been treated.

His 
wife, Patricia Smillie-Scavelli, told Irish Central: 'He really gives 
love. He climbs into your lap, he would prefer to sit in your lap than 
lay on the floor. He also sleeps in our bed at night, along with the 
cat.'

Though understandably Patrick remains nervous around strangers, reported NBC, a treat or two quickly remedies his fear.

'There are very few animals, or any life form, that could have gone through and survived what he has, and really never looked back,' said Dr Scavelli of his courageous recovery.

And few who have simultaneously become so much of a celebrity. 

Hospital staffers have chronicled his progress on their website 
and a Facebook page has garnered fans from around the world.

Devoted: Patricia Smillie-Scavelli holds a 1-year-old Patrick in April last year at the hospital where she is an administrator and her husband, Dr Thomas Scavelli is director

He's received hundreds of emails, donations, gifts and letters from those inspired by his tale of survival.

The hospital ordered 500 thank-you cards with Patrick's picture to mail 
to those who have sent collars, dog shirts, toys, scrapbook pages or dog 
blankets embroidered with Patrick's name, and they are fast running out.

When Patrick was brought to the hospital after being rescued by officials at the Associated Humane Societies, he was so starved, emaciated and dehydrated he was curled into a ball, unable to walk or stand.

His ribcage protruded, he weighed about 20 pounds - roughly 30 pounds less than average - and was covered in sores with parts of skin hanging off him, according to Patricia Smillie-Scavelli, Dr Scavelli's wife and the administrator of the hospital.

Peace: Patrick is still nervous around strangers but a treat helps earn his trust

'Everyone thought that, you bring in 
an animal like that, that looks like it's really just a corpse, you put 
it to sleep,' Mrs Smillie-Scavelli said.

'But
of course, he looked up at you with those eyes, and you say: How can 
you give up on this dog? How can you, when he's not giving up on life? 
So, we gave him that second chance, and he has just run with it, and 
thrived.'

- Vets on their decision to not euthanize Patrick

After weeks of emergency measures that
included a transfusion of three pints of dog blood, a special diet, 
medicine and physical therapy, Patrick began to gain weight and eat 
solid food.

He also started to enjoy taking outdoor walks in the sun and playing with the many toys that well-wishers had sent him.

'This
is not a month of starvation,' Dr Scavelli said soon after his rescue. 
'This is a lifetime probably, or at least months and months of neglect, 
and to see the way he cares for people and trusts people, that's really 
been the most interesting and rewarding thing to see about the canine 
spirit.'

Kisha Curtis of Newark, is scheduled to 
appear in court on charges of neglect and abandonment - fourth-degree 
offences for 'tormenting and torturing' an animal by failing to provide 
food and water, prosecutors said.

Happy holidays! While the Associated Humane Societies are fighting for custody to find Patrick a home, the Scavellis are hoping to be considered as his permanent future owners

Horrifying: When he was first brought in Patrick was starving and had been subjected to months, possibly a life time of horrific abuse

The charges could carry a maximum jail sentence of 18 months and a fine of up to $10,000. She also faces two abandonment charges punishable by up to six months in jail with a $1,000 fine.

Authorities said Curtis tied the dog to a railing in her Newark apartment building and left the state for more than a week. A janitor later found the emaciated dog in a trash bin.

Curtis has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Her mother told reporters at her daughter's court hearing that the dog had been given to Kisha but she could not take care of it, so she'd tied it up outside hoping somebody else would take it.

The Essex County courthouse has also received more than 600 letters and 
faxes from around the world expressing concern for the dog and urging 
swift and harsh punishment for Curtis.

'In the 17 years we've been here we've never seen this type of response 
to an animal,' Patricia Smillie-Scavelli said.

'There's something about 
Patrick that has really sparked interest, honestly, from throughout the 
entire world.'

She hopes to keep and care for Patrick herself.
