A lawyer for Amanda Bynes said on Thursday that he thinks her New York bong-throwing case will be resolved 'soon'.

The troubled actress didn't appear during a brief court appearance in Manhattan as she remains in a psychiatric hospital in California.

However, according to TMZ her lawyer Gerald Shargel asked for a 'postponement for up to 18 months' while she continues psychiatric treatment, meaning she could remain in the facility until 2015.

Not in attendance: Amanda Bynes was not present at the hearing on Thursday where here lawyer hoped for a resolution to her 'bong throwing' case

Shargel is said to be working with prosecutors to resolve the case, which could mean charges would be dropped if she agrees to stay out of trouble.

Sources tell TMZ that the case could be dropped altogether.

Meanwhile, Radar had reported that Bynes' mother Lynn had withdrawn for her petition for a conservatorship, taking control of her daughter's affairs.

But TMZ claim that Lynne has already been given the power to make medical and financial decisions for her daughter by doctors, so there is no need for a conservatorship.

Room with a view: Amanda was charged earlier this year with reckless endangerment and marijuana possession after building managers accused the star of throwing a bong from her window

Bynes was charged earlier this year with reckless endangerment and marijuana possession after building managers called police because they said she was smoking pot in the lobby of her Manhattan apartment.

When officers entered her 36th floor apartment, they said they saw her heave a bong out the window.

The 27-year-old Hairspray star later appeared in court in a disheveled blond wig and said she didn't do anything wrong.

Recovery: TMZ report that the troubled star could remain in a mental health facility for another year and a half

It was one episode in a string of erratic incidents involving the star in recent months.

She was institutionalized in August after authorities said she set a small fire in the driveway of a home in Thousand Oaks.

Bynes pleaded not guilty to drunken driving in California, and her attorney there argued Wednesday that she needed a competency hearing because she was unfit for trial.

The New York judge on Thursday said Bynes didn't need a separate mental health hearing.

Her attorney, Gerald Shargel, said she remained hospitalized and wished her a speedy recovery.

In control? It is now believed that Amanda's mother Lynne has been granted a conservatorship over her daughter
