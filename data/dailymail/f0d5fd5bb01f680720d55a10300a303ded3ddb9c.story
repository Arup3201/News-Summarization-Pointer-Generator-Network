We may love our avocados ripe and creamy but, as fans know only too well, picking out a good one is very much a hit-and-miss affair.

Its thick dark skin means it’s anyone’s guess if the fruit will be too hard, brown, or soft.

Now a supermarket giant has come up with a solution to banish the guesswork: a ready-peeled avocado in its own see-through vacuum-packed pouch.

Convenience food: Shoppers will be able to see straight away whether the fruit is good to buy

The technology – developed by Morrisons just in time for Christmas prawn cocktails – peels, de-stones and packs the fruit so shoppers can see its insides before buying.

The egg-shaped Haas variety is picked in Peru and immediately peeled before being vacuum packed.

From the end of the month the chain will start selling avocados for a hefty £5 as part of a cocktail kit consisting of four perfectly ripe halves and a pot of prawns.

Neil Nugent, Morrisons chef and head of innovation, said: ‘The technology uses non-thermal food processing to improve the shelf-life. Shoppers can now guarantee they will only serve a perfectly ripe avocado.’

Cashing in for Christmas? Supermarket giant Morrisons is planning on putting the product on sale in the time for the festive period
