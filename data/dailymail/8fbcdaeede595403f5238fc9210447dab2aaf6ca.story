The new airport tsar clashed with Boris Johnson yesterday by announcing that all options for expansion are ‘on the table’.

Sir Howard Davies said these included controversial extra runways at Heathrow and Gatwick.

But this put him on a collision course with the London Mayor, who backs a  so-called ‘Boris Island’ mega-airport in the Thames Estuary.

London Mayor Boris Johnson today said he would 
not necessarily accept the conclusions of the government's airport 
capacity review, which is being carried out by Sir Howard Davies

Mr Johnson warned that going into the 
next general election, due by 2015, with the prospect of a third runway 
at Heathrow still on the agenda would be ‘toxic and disastrous’ for the 
Tories.

Sir Howard, chairman of the Airports 
Commission, accepted that the Coalition has ruled this out for this 
Parliament and that no second runway can be built at Gatwick until after
2019.

But, he declared: ‘Options after that are open. A third runway at Heathrow is on the table.’

Sir Howard will also look at other 
radical suggestions. These include creating a four-runway Heathrow to 
the west of the existing site and proposals for the estuary airport in 
Kent or expansion elsewhere in the country.

His six-strong commission will produce
an interim report next year on future aviation policy. This will set 
out ‘options’ and some short-term action, including making better use of
existing runways around the capital and regions.

But the final report, with more 
significant and controversial plans for the longer term, will not appear
until summer 2015, after the last possible date for the next election.

Any proposal to expand Heathrow would prove controversial for people living in homes in west London

Sir Howard said he would ‘make best use of time in the long grass’ to give the next government ‘a  flying start’.

Mr Johnson, however, wants Sir Howard 
to ‘accelerate his timescale’. He derided the Coalition for ‘a policy of
utter inertia’ and described delays to deciding aviation plans as a 
‘fudgerama’.

‘It’s going to be toxic and disastrous
to go into the election of 2015 with Heathrow runway three still on the
agenda, millions of Londoners still in a state of great anxiety and 
uncertainty about whether or not they are going to suffer from severe 
noise pollution,’ he said.

But Sir Howard stressed: ‘The 
Coalition is prepared for us to look broadly at all the options on the 
table as well as some that are not so a government can come to it after 
the election with an open mind.’The aim would be to build ‘political consensus’ which is currently lacking, he added.

Other options he will examine include expanding Stansted,  Birmingham or Cardiff airports.

Critics have questioned the 
impartiality of some members of his commission. They include Sir John 
Armitt, former Network Rail and Olympic Delivery chief, who is currently
undertaking policy work for Labour leader Ed Miliband.

Sir Howard also pledged to look at potential compensation for homeowners living around Heathrow if he backs a third runway.

‘We need to look at that,’ he said. ‘We could try it out on Nick Clegg who lives in Putney.’

So too does former Transport Secretary
Justine Greening, who also opposes the third runway because of the 
noise blight for her constituents.

The Prime Minister’s office denied the
issue had been kicked into the long grass. David Cameron’s spokesman 
said: ‘People on different sides of the debate have  particular 
entrenched views.

‘Often those different options and 
different ideas about how we should approach the issue of  airport 
capacity are put forward without the evidence.’
