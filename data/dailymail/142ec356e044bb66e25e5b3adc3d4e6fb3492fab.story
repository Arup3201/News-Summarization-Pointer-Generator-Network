San Jose State University has expelled three students accused of bullying their black roommate by putting a bike lock around his neck and repeatedly taunting him.

A fourth student involved in the case has been put on probation for the rest of his college career.

The four white students, including a juvenile who has not been named, have pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor battery and hate crime charges.

They are accused of putting the bike lock on then-freshman Donald 'DJ' Williams Jr and taunting him with racial slurs, barricading him in his room and putting up a Confederate flag.

As part of their punishment, the ousted students are banned from enrolling in any California State University college.

Attorney Eric Geffon, who represents one of the expelled students who is being prosecuted as a juvenile, came away disappointed with the outcome, saying school officials didn't conduct a thorough review of the case because their mind had already been made up.

‘It's a no-brainer,’ LaDoris Cordell, a retired judge who chaired a task force formed by the university to investigate the matter, told San Jose Mercury. ‘They have no business being enrolled at SJSU.’

Williams, from Santa Cruz, revealed last November said he was afraid to come home to the
 four-bedroom dormitory suite he had shared with Logan Beaschler, 19, 
Joseph Bomgardner, 19, and Colin Warren, 19, since late August 2013.

The
 teens nicknamed the then-17-year-old 'three-fifths,' referring to how 
the government once counted black people as a fraction of a person, and 
simply 'fraction' when he protested to the name.

The roommates allegedly hung the Confederate flag and wrote 
the N-word on a chalk board in their living area, and locked Williams in his room.

The university found that Beaschler 
and Warren violated six university rules, resulting in their expulsion. 
Meanwhile, Bomgardner was suspended until July 31 without admitting his 
guilt and ordered to undergo counseling. If he decides to return to 
school in the following semester, he will remain on a permanent academic
 probation.

The Rev. 
Jethroe Moore II, head of the local chapter of the NAACP, welcomed the 
university's decision to expel the three teens, but he expressed concern
 that if they are sent to a county jail for a year - the maximum 
sentence for a misdemeanor hate crime - 'they'd probably come back as 
skinheads.'

San
 Jose State University President Mohammad Qayoumi released a statement 
back in November, admitting that he and other school officials could 
have done more to protect the black student.

‘By
 failing to recognize the meaning of a Confederate flag, intervene 
earlier to stop the abuse or impose sanctions as soon as the gravity of 
the behavior became clear, we failed him. I failed him,’ Qayoumi stated.

'I'm still in shock,' Williams told the Santa Cruz Sentinel
 in a phone interview at the time, adding that he'd never experienced 
such horrific treatment despite being one of only a few black students 
at his Santa Cruz high school.

He said he didn't report the situation to campus police because he hoped it would stop.

'I tried not to dwell on this. But my family is upset and I'm upset,' he said.

Williams
 later told university police he always locked his door at night because
 he was scared of most of the other students he lived with and said his 
grades suffered because he didn't feel safe studying in his room.

The young men confessed to the 
relentless harassment in police interviews but denied their actions were
 racist, insisting instead the incidents were good-humored 'pranks.'

University police, however, 
recommended District Attorney Jeff Rosen file the case as a hate crime 
and prosecutor Erin West emphatically agreed.

'The
 District Attorney's Office has no tolerance for those who criminally 
prey on others because they are different,' West told the newspaper.

The students could face penalties ranging from probation to a year in jail if convicted.

The
 bullied student was assigned to live with seven young white men in the 
house in late August. In mid-October 2013, his parents noticed a 
Confederate flag draped in the living room of the suite and the 'N-word'
 scrawled on a surface in the living room.

Concerned, they reported it to 
housing officials who notified campus police and two of the roommates 
were immediately transferred to a different dorm.

However,
 the San Jose Sentinel cited police reports as saying at least two 
residential assistants were already aware a Confederate flag was being 
displayed in the house.

But
 instead of reporting the students, they asked the young men to take it 
out of a window 'so it could not be seen by the general public.'

Abuse: The suspects confessed to police that they wrestled the black freshman to the ground and put a metal bike lock, similar to that pictured, around his neck

When asked about the Confederate flag, Beaschler reportedly told police it was a meant as an edgy joke to 'ruffle people's feathers' and referred to his Southern California roots, San Francisco Chronicle reported.

The harassment was allegedly spurred on by a two-day orientation session that included sensitivity training.

According to reports, the teens blocked Williams' bedroom door with furniture on multiple occasions to prevent him from coming out.

Another time, the suspects confessed to police, they wrestled him to the ground, putting a metal bike lock around his neck. The second time they tried this, he managed to escape but came away with bruises, he told police.

In another instance, they took the doorknob from inside a closet and attempted to coerce the claustrophobic freshman to step inside with a series of nasty post-it notes.

Nazi symbols, including swastikas and the 'SS' symbol, were found in the apartment and also a picture of Adolf Hitler, the Sentinel reported.

When the alleged victim's father talked to the roommates and reported the bullying, the freshman received a sarcastic and at times threatening apology note that cited 'the Beloved Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr.' and was signed off 'The Residents.'

'The Residents have welcomed you, it is not advised to ignore the call of The Residents,' read a postscript.
