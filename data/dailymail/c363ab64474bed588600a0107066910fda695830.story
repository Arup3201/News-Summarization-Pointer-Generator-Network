Resigned: Scott Sassa, a senior executive at media firm Hearst, has left his job after explicit texts he allegedly sent to a stripper were seen by his bosses

A high-flying executive has resigned from a top job with one of America's biggest media firms after sexually explicit text messages - allegedly sent between him and a stripper - were forwarded to his bosses.

Scott Sassa, 53, left his role as president of Hearst Entertainment and Syndication group after the woman apparently forwarded the explicit messages to senior figures at the company.

Mr Sassa, who was responsible for the firm's interests in cable television networks, including ESPN and Lifetime, is alleged to have sent the texts to the LA-based stripper and arranged to meet up with her.

The woman, who has not been named, is believed to have sent Mr Sassa - who is a single father-of-two - revealing pictures of herself during the exchanges.

She is accused of trying to blackmail him by threatening to forward the messages to his bosses at Hearst unless he paid her money.

She was helped by her boyfriend in trying to extort money out of Mr Sassa - who has also held senior positions at Fox, NBC, Friendster and Marvel Entertainment, the New York Post reports. He is thought to have met the stripper in LA in December.

The stripper is believed to have made a list of demands, but Mr Sassa refused to pay the money. Her boyfriend then emailed the text messages to executives at Hearst, according to the Post.

Among those thought to have received the messages were Hearst's CEO Frank Bennack Jr and Michael Clinton, president of marketing for the magazines.

Mr Sassa is understood to have been asked to resign on Tuesday with Hearst arranging aÂ  'large compensation package for him.

Neither Mr Sassa or Hearst have commented on the matter.

Mr Sassa had previously enjoyed a successful career at NBC, which he joined in 1997 as president of the NBC Television Stations division and before that at Turner Broadcasting.
