With a luxury childrenswear market thought to be worth £500 million in the UK alone and the likes of Romeo Beckham already making a foray into the world of fashion, it was only a matter of time before the kids got their own fashion week.

And last night the first ever Global 
Kids’ Fashion Week (GKFW) landed in London with a bang.

Stylish celebrity parents and their equally fashion-forward children were out in their droves at Freemason's Hall, Covent Garden, to witness the world's first ever kid's catwalk show, and it did not disappoint.

The very first Global Kids Fashion Week launched by AlexandAlexa showcased top designers A/W designs and drew celebrities like Jodie and Jemma Kidd to the front row

The show had a fun and playful vibe as the professional child models claimed the runway as their own wearing designers such as Oscar De La Renta, Paul Smith, Gaultier and Missoni

GKFW cast a spotlight on premium kids’ 
fashion, from both established designers and emerging names and aimed to
 educate and inspire people about children's fashion – celebrating how this 
specialist category has thrived and evolved over the past five years.

The
 event, which was sponsored by designer e-tailer AlexandAlexa.com, 
opened its doors yesterday evening to a herd of excitable children and 
their parents who took full advantage of the treats on offer.

Jodie Kidd, who watched in the front row with her blonde haired son, said of the show 'it was absolutely gorgeous'

And
 the little tyke's every needs were catered for, as there was 
entertainment from supporting brands 
such as child-friendly nail varnish company Little BU, a bloggers lounge
 and a sponsored photobooth as well as a popcorn machine and candy floss, all in collaboration with event partner the V&A Museum of 
Childhood.

Ambassadors
 involved in the project include Sarah Curran, founder of 
my-wardrobe.com, Tanya Kazeminy Mackay, founding partner of Mama Mio, 
model Portia Freeman, Pippa Vosper, founder of the maternallychic.com blog 
and Olcay Gulsen, Dutch fashion designer and founder of SuperTrash 
Girls.

Speaking ahead of 
the event, Portia Freeman, an international model who has even modelled 
with her own young son for Italian Vogue, said: 'I'm super excited 
because I love childrenswear, I am obsessed so I am just here to enjoy 
it.

Jemma and Jodie Kidd attended with their own fashion conscious little ones and stopped to pose for photographers after the show

'I think it's important
 to celebrate children's fashion to show everybody just how amazing it 
is and women and men all around the world wear amazing clothes so it's 
really important that children can too.'

Designers showing included the likes 
of luxury labels Paul Smith Junior, Junior Gaultier, Chloe, Little Marc 
Jacobs, I Pinco Pallino, Suzanne Ermann, Anne Kurris, Supertrash.

As
 well as established brands such as Tommy Hilfiger and Diesel and 
emerging independent brands like Rachel Riley, Anne Kuris and Wildfox were also featured.

Portia
 noted that she was looking forward to seeing Tommy Hilfiger, Oscar de 
la Renta and Chloe and although Romeo Beckham didn't make an 
appearance like many had hoped, she loved his Burberry campaign.

'He looked so cute, happy and smiley and it's great,' she said.

The 24-year-old would encourage her own 3-year-old son Dylan (with Kooks bassist Pete Denton), to pursue his dreams if he wanted to follow in her modelling footsteps.

'I
 would let him follow his dreams, as long as he was happy, sane and 
healthy, that's the most important thing for me as a mother,' she said.

Portia
 and her son took their seats on the front row alongside Jodie Kidd and 
Kate Moss' make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury, who both brought along 
their little bundles of joy too.

But
 as soon as the music began to boom and the models made their way out 
onto the catwalk, it was clear that one audience member wanted to join 
in on the fun.

Scotch R'Belle collection had a 'back to nature' feel with delicate fabrics and  more muted colours layered up, incorporating various cultural influences

Charlotte 
Tilbury's red-headed son Flynn, 3, wanted to make his own modelling 
debut and pranced onto the catwalk and strutted alongside the 
professional child models, much to the audience's delight.

'He
 had a Zoolander moment. He did some very dodgy Zoolander moves, I was 
like "Oh my gosh, what have I given birth to"', laughed Charlotte after 
the show.

Proving that fashion doesn't have an 
age restriction, the young models looked bang-on-trend in their stylish 
designs.

There were John Galliano waistcoats, Roberto Cavalli 
leopard-print handbags, Kenzo bobble hats and Fendi leather coats, to name but a few.

And
 it wouldn't be Kid's Fashion Week without an element of fun.

As the show drew to a close, the 
bass-filled beats of Kanye West Gold Digga played as three youngsters 
cartwheeled and break danced along the catwalk as the raucous audience 
cheered along.

Jodie Kidd's blonde-haired baby boy watched avidly as his model mother boogied to the beats and admired the clothes.

'It was all gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. I just wish they made grown-up sizes
 in some of those dresses, they were so cute.

'It was really fun, a 
lovely idea. I've got my own little boy and it's just so nice shopping 
for them so we've had a really lovely afternoon,' she said after the show.

Emily Johnston, founder of hit fashion site FashionFoieGras.com was front row at the show. She said: 'Never before have I seen a catwalk that brought about so many smiles in the audience. From kids skipping to kids cartwheeling down the runway, each and every look they showcased was beautiful and very professionally presented.

Roberto Cavalli's pieces were sophisticated and tailored, featurting pops of animal print

'Although, I do believe this is the only event in the fashion calendar when a young one can storm the catwalk and cause laughs instead of sheer panic.

'It was all wonderfully executed and left me rethinking the plan to wait on little ones. I foresee this being a permanent fixture on the fashion calendar.'

The 
fun-packed show drew to a close to the sounds of Calvin Harris' Feel So 
Close as the young models made their way down the catwalk clapping 
excitedly in unison, clearly having the time of their lives.

Alex Theophanous, founder and CEO of 
AlexandAlexa.com added: ‘Kids’ fashion is playful, fun and innovative – 
we all believe it deserves its own dedicated platform.

'This
 is why we are so proud to be supporting the very first Global Kids’ 
Fashion Week. With this event, we aim to put children’s fashion on the 
map worldwide’.
