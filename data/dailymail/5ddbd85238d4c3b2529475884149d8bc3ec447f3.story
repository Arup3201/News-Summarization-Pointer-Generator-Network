Critical: British Airways boss Willie Walsh attacked the prime minister and chancellor at a launch in China

British Airways boss Willie Walsh has launched a highly personal attack on David Cameron and George Osborne, saying they lack vision on the economy and only ‘respond to whatever is topical’.

Mr Walsh, who is angered by the delays in making a decision over the future of Heathrow, also accused the Prime Minister and his Chancellor of fostering the image that the lucrative Chinese tourism market isn’t welcome here.

The chief executive of International Airline Group, owner of both British Airways and Spain’s Iberia, has previously sparred with the Government over its aviation policy but went a step further yesterday.

At the opening of BA’s new route to Chengdu in south central China, he said: ‘I am not a fan of Cameron or Osborne.

'I have no political affiliation.

'I haven’t seen much evidence of visionary leadership there and to me they respond to whatever is topical rather than setting out a long term plan or vision for growth in the UK economy.’

He said he is pleased that there is more optimism about the economy but warned there is a long way to go.

‘If I was Osborne I wouldn’t be popping the champagne corks at this stage,’ he said.

‘There’s little evidence steps  are being taken that are going  to be more conducive to growth, and... We need to see greater optimism, greater visibility and  a bit of vision for the future  and I think that’s lacking.’

The Government has asked Sir Howard Davies to spearhead the Airport Commission to examine capacity in the UK, but Mr Walsh said he believes it is futile.

‘I’ve said all along and I have met Davies twice now that I think he will produce a fantastic report – it has got to be the best report on airports ever seen,’ he said.

‘But nothing is going to happen with it because it will be handed over to politicians who won’t act on it. I still don’t see any prospect of any political party taking hold of the report and actually doing something with it.

‘So I have no criticisms of Davies or what they are doing. But I still don’t see any prospect of any political party taking hold of the report and actually doing something with it.’

He also claimed the Government’s ‘bureaucratic’ approach to issuing visas to Chinese tourists is harming tourism.

Trade between the UK and China has been steadily increasing and China is now the UK’s eighth biggest export market.

No vision?: David Cameron and George Osborne have just been celebrating what looks like economic success

Mr Walsh wants answers from the government on when a decision will be made on Heathrow's future

He also predicted there will be a raft of European airlines going out of business in the next 12 months

However, Chinese people travelling here – even in transit – need a visa, which is not required if they land in continental Europe.

‘We need a visa regime that it less bureaucratic,’ he said.

‘It is getting better but people need to feel that the UK is actually welcoming them.

‘I think there is a perception in China that the UK does not want to see Chinese tourists and Chinese business and I think we have got to put a bit of effort into changing that image.

He said the UK is missing out on a ‘huge opportunity’.

He added: ‘We are losing out to organised tour groups in Europe who bypass the UK as it is too much trouble to get two visas.

'I think if we are to be attractive to the high end tourists particularly, in the UK we will have to have more people who can speak Mandarin, speak Chinese and make them feel welcome.

‘Not just at the airports but at major tourists venues as well.’

Mr Walsh has previously said he thinks it is ‘tragic’ that Heathrow will never succeed in getting a third runway because of political failure and that the airport will be left behind by faster growing hubs.

He said he believes politicians are not brave enough to grasp this and that Heathrow missed the opportunity of expansion many years ago.

He also predicted that there will be a raft of European airlines going out of business over the next 12 months and said he is interested in making some acquisitions but has nothing currently in his sights.

Supercilious, arrogant, and toffee nosed. And that's only the cabin waitresses (trolley dollies) and waiters I'm talking about. The cockpit crew think they are gods and as for management, they look down on God.

I wish someone would beat this little leprechaun severely with his shillelagh. That might shut his big mouth.

True, but be careful, Willie Walsh, they have ways of making you walk!

Best Airlines- in my opinion- Singapore, Etihad, Emirates, JAL and Thai International Worst -in my opinion-Ryan Air,- Qantas and British Airways.US carriers are are nothing special either.My favorite airline is SIA. I fly a lot so the above -apart from Ryanair- is based on experience of air travel in all classes from first to economy.

I'd recommend he develops his flying hub in Spain.  They currently have three brand new airports-one with the longest runway in Europe- that can be bought for a song. They have excellent high speed rail connections that will whisk you anywhere at 300km/hr. Here on the other hand, the green lobby is so powerful that  he'll be whistling in the wind just for a 3rd runway  at an airport that runs at 98% capacity, he'll wait forever for a decent train service that's on-time and fast, and his passengers will continue to be forced to pay the highest airport (green?) taxes in the World. And we thought we could teach Europe a lesson or two!

He's right but it's fairly naive to think that  Dave and George are interested in anything other than
a) What is in their own best interest
b) As a result of a) , what is most topical (rather than most pressing)

They're politicians , so their agenda will not involve what is best for the Country - it involves what's best for them.

If I was the CEO of British Airways i would start by sorting out British Airways before i had a shot at anybody else. BA are nothing special,they could start by washing their aircraft and employing some good looking female flight attendants who don't think they are doing you a favor by serving a meal. If you want good service and new airplanes fly Singapore Airlines.
