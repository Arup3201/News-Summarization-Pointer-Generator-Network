Mitt Romney is well used to going toe-to-toe with America's political heavyweights, but now he's going to test his mettle against a heavyweight of a more intimidating nature – Evander Holyfield.

The 2012 presidential nominee will fight the 52-year-old former world champion at a charity event at Salt Lake City's Rail Event Center on May 15.

However, he doesn't anticipate getting his opponent on the ropes.

Romney, 68, who recently announced he will not be running for president in 2016, told The Salt Lake Tribune: 'It will either be a very short fight, or I will be knocked unconscious. It won't be much of a fight. We'll both suit up and get in the ring and spar around a little bit.'

He added: 'We just thought it would be a lot better to provide this kind of entertainment rather than just have dinner and listen to speakers.'

The bizarre bout is taking place to raise money for CharityVision, which provides equipment to doctors in developing countries treating people with curable blindness.

 ROMNEY

Age: 68

Weight: 185 pounds

Height 6ft 1in

Reach: Unknown 

Wins: 0 (1 presidential defeat) 

 

HOLYFIELD

Age: 52

Weight: 226 pounds

height 6ft 2in

Reach: 78 inches

Wins: 44 

The event is a black-tie occasion that will also feature fights between professional boxers.

Holyfield famously had part of his ear bitten off in a fight with Mike Tyson in 1997.

It's doubtful Romney will resort to such dirty tactics in May.

Holyfield has since rebuilt his relationship with Tyson and they recently appeared at Village East Cinema in New York for a screening of new documentary Champs, which tells their story, and that of Bernard Hopkins.

Directed by Bert Marcus, Champs focuses on the aforementioned trio's rise from poverty to the top of the sport.

Holyfield last fought in 2011. The lack of practice isn't likely to prevent victory in the next one.
