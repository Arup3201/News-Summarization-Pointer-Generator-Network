Liverpool's World Cup stars were handed an extended time off, however Lambert decided to start training with the rest of his new teammates just a few weeks after returning from the World Cup.

'It was always my intention to come back earlier, whether I was at Southampton or Liverpool - but obviously I am desperate to hit the ground running and do well for Liverpool.

'I thought it was massively important I come back early, and make sure I'm in the best shape possible for when the season kicks off, because that's what all this is for,' Lambert told the Liverpool Echo.

Lambert is itching to get some minutes under his belt as he was handed just three minutes of action during his time in Brazil.

However the 32-year-old will not be involved in Liverpool's pre-season fixture against Danish outfit Brondby on Wednesday evening as manager Brendan Rodgers has chosen to omit him from his squad.Â
