She might be an 'ambassador' for the British Fashion Council but Samantha Cameron has been a rare sight at London Fashion Week so far.

But it seems Britain's first lady of fashion is making up for lost time after she appeared front row at Christopher Kane and Erdem this morning.

Mrs Cameron, who wore a black textured top from Swedish high street brand COS and a Jonathan Saunders skirt, is also expected to attend the Peter Pilotto show later today.

Stylish: Mrs Cameron was seen in a COS top and Jonathan Saunders skirt at Erdem and Christopher Kane

Elegant: Samantha Cameron showed off her penchant for bright colours and was front row at Erdem and Kane

Minimal: Erdem offered an unusually muted vision for S/S14 with his trademark florals replaced with feathers

New direction: Although Erdem's ladylike silhouettes remained, he plumped for a monochrome palette

She was joined at the shows by Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who was composed and elegant in a burgundy check coat with grey fur tippets.

Also at the show was Chanel stylist Caroline Sieber, socialite Alexa Chung and veteran model Laura Bailey.

But while all eyes were on Samantha Cameron off the catwalk, on the runway, both Erdem and Christopher Kane were busy underlining exactly why he's worth a visit from Vogue.

Erdem offered up a typically ladylike assortment of elegant shift dresses and clean tailoring but eschewed traditional florals, plumping instead for feathers.

Unusually, colour was low on the Erdem agenda, with chic black and white dominating the subdued palette.

Stunning: Christopher Kane's latest collection appeared on the catwalk at the Farmiloe Building in London

Vintage Kane: The latest collection from the British designer had ladylike touches and a real sense of humour

Sheer genius: Delicate spaghetti straps and neon panels

Stylised: Big sequinned lillies were the flower of choice

Pastels: Pistachio, blush and lavender dominated the palette

Kane, by contrast, offered up a colourful riot of pastels and print of the sort we'll all want to buy into come next summer.

Highlights
included cleverly cut shifts with delicate leaf-shaped cutouts in 
blush, pistachio and lavender, and a delicate white spaghetti-strapped 
dress with sheer neon panels.

In true Kane style, it was ladylike, sexed-up and boasting a very naughty sense of humour.

Bold blooms, a summer staple, appeared on skirts, dresses and sweatshirts in the form of supersized, stylised lillies and orchids.

It was all very much in line with what we've come to expect from Kane and while there weren't huge numbers of fresh ideas on show, you couldn't help but reflect that since Kane has clearly hit on a winning formula, he'd have to be mad to change it.

Perfect prints: Kane's new collection featured plenty of print and some wonderful oversized blooms
