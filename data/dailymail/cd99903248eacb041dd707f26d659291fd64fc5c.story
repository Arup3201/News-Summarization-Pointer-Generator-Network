Frances Marques produces a clear plastic jar containing a fleshy orange blob suspended in pickling juice and presents it to the camera.

'This is my labia,' she says nonchalantly. 'I think she looks better in the jar than hanging down there.'

Frances is just one of the female stars of Plastic Wives, TLC's  controversial new American reality TV show taking a closer peek at the lives of the women married to some of LA's most successful cosmetic surgeons - all of whom have made it their life's work to reap the free perks of the spousal scalpel.

'This is my labia': Frances Marques has had several cosmetic procedures including a nose-job, several breast implants and vaginal rejuvenation surgery

Best pals: Frances Marques with her ex-husband Dr Ryan Stanton, who continues to operate on her for free

Ms Marques was married to Dr Ryan Stanton for seven years before 'he 
got the mid-life crisis' and left her for a younger woman, but the two remain friends and she continues to enjoy the freebies he happily provides her with, and even help him run the surgery she co-owns with him.

The Brazilian national, who lives in Beverley Hills, told ABC News she has had plastic surgery 'from here to my camel toe', including a couple of breast augmentations, a nose job and vaginal rejuvenation procedure, the operation which led to the 'leftover' bits of labia she keeps at home in a medical jar as as 'keepsake'.

But Ms Marques - who at one point in the series throws a party at which all the guests are given free Botox - denies the surgery has made her or her friends look too artificial, saying: 'They are calling us plastic wives, but we don't look overdone.'

But she admits that her desire to alter her appearance has become something of an obsession: 'I am 
kind of addicted, I go there every day to the clinic.

'There are so many 
new things coming, so many new technologies, new implants, new Botox, 
new filler, laser procedures and all that, and I want it all.'

'It's become an addiction': Frances Marques admits her fondness for surgical freebies has got a little out of hand

One of Ms Marques' co-stars is 
Veronica Matlock, the wife of Dr David Matlock, who is shown on TV 
receiving the 'G-shot' - an injection into her G-spot - from the husband
 she calls The Vagina Man. The procedure was her fourth anniversary 
present.

At a dinner party Dr Matlock tells guests an anecdote in which a former patient bumps into him in the street and comes over to say hello.

He says: 'I said to her, "Darling, I don't recognise faces".'

Also featured on the 
show is Dayna Devon, a former Extra TV presenter married to plastic 
surgeon Dr Brent Moelleken, who is filmed being operated on by her husband.

She said: 'In any other community in the world it makes no sense, but it's Hollywood.

'I wanted to continue working 
television, unfortunately you hit forty you want to contiue working in 
TV there are some things you gotta think about. I wasn't ready to hang it up yet, I wanted to extend my shelf life a a little bit.'

Perks of the job: Dr David Matlock, shown performing surgery on his wife Veronica's vagina, says he doesn't recognise patients by their faces

Plastic Wives documents - with 
unfettered access to the operating room - the obsessive nature of 
plastic surgery, and how that obsession can get completely out of hand 
when people are provided with free procedures.

Even the husbands of the 
'plastic wives' say they feel powerless to stop them demanding work.

The
 women admit that their husbands aren't always supportive of their 
ever-expanding cosmetic surgery resumes, but this doesn't stop them.

Veronica Matlock explained: 'One way to 
get exactly what I want is to say, "alright, don't worry about it, I'll go
 to doctor so-and-so," and he'll be like, "oh, no you don't!".'

Marital perks? Dayna Devon mid-procedure

Mrs Devon says she doesn't regret any of the surgeries she has had.

'I'm
 happy now,' she said. 'I mean don't get me wrong, I still obsess about 
an acne scar or something, but I think most woman do find things that 
they obsess about.'

Dr Lisa Casselith, a plastic surgeon who says she spends her days correcting procedures that have gone too far, says: 'It's our job to say "no, you look abnormal, you can not have more." You 
have to hold that patient back.

'For purely selfish reasons, I don't 
want a patient with giant lips sitting in my waiting room showing my other 
patients this is what I do,' she admitted.

'The
 insider phrase is 'Beverly Hills', so
 when people come in and they are over-done, I say to them, "I'm sorry, 
you're looking too Beverly Hills." And that's when you stop.'

Ms Devon, who says the group of 
Plastic Wives will not talk to wives of surgeons they don't like, added:
 'I heard some good advice a long time ago. If you're looking for a 
plastic surgeon, look at his wife. And that's a perfect example of the 
work he most likely does.'
