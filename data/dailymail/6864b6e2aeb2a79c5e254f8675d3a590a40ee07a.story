If being taunted by your dad and little sister is all too familiar then this boy wailing about his favorite NFL player being traded - while his sister giggles and his dad teases him - may ring true.

This video of a boy called Gavin, from Matthews North Carolina, giving up on his favorite American football team, The Carolina Panthers, after they fire his hero Steve Smith, has gone viral.

In a moment of fury, Gavin says: 'I hate the Panthers' whilst attempting to hit the camera that his dad, Matt Simone, has used to video him crying.

'I hate The Panthers' bursts out little Gavin after NFL player Steve Smith leaves the team

Gavin's dad starts the video by taunting his son, telling him: 'The Panthers said that they didn't even want him on the team anymore - so they fired him'

The video, which was uploaded last Thursday before being posted on CBS, tracks the moment that Gavin finds out that wide receiver Steve Smith is no longer with the Carolina Panthers and has moved to the Baltimore Ravens.

Gavin's dad starts the video by telling his son: 'The Panthers said that they didn't even want him on the team anymore - so they fired him.'

Gavin's little sister, Sophia, asks: 'Why did they fire him daddy?'

Mr Simone replies: 'Because they said he was too old to play.'

He then sums it up by saying: 'So now we can't cheer for Steve Smith anymore.'

Sister Sophia says: 'So now we have to cheer for Cam Newton.'

The taunts become too much for little Gavin who breaks down in tears and hits his head against the car's seat.

When his dad says: 'Who are we going to cheer for on Sunday's now?' Gavin howls out 'Nobody'.

But the heartache does not stop there, Gavin then covers his face in despair and says: 'I don't even want to watch The Panthers, I hate The Panthers.'

The team may have lost their biggest fan. When Gavin's dad asks: 'Who are we going to cheer for on Sunday's now?' Gavin howls out 'Nobody'.

And no one else will be able to replace the his hero, not even quarterback Cam Newton or Luke Kuechly, the team's linebacker who he now says he 'hates'.

He has given up on the sport altogether: 'I don't even want a favorite team,' he cries.

Although his little sister will still cheer for the team, they may have lost their biggest fan in Gavin.

And the video ends on one final taunt from dad, who answers to Gavin's claim that he won't support the team anymore with: 'Because they fired Steve Smith?'

Gavin has given up on American football. 'I don't even want a favorite team,' he cries

Gavin's little sister, Sophia, smiles with glee as her dad tells her older brother that his favorite player Steve Smith has left the Carolina Panthers

Yesterday the wide receiver tried to track down his fan.

Steve Smith tweeted a link to the Youtube video and wrote: 'I need that kid's info...I need help finding Gavin.'

Less than a day later, he had found Gavin and tweeted: 'I found Gavin. His dad and I got in contact. Once I am back in town I will hook up with the lil guy.'
