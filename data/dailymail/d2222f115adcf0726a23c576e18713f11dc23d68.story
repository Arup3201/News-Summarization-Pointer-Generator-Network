A police motorcyclist was carrying out routine checks and a cars were in a line of traffic waiting to be questioned by the officer.

Ms Lakin, a radiographer, and Mr Dudley, had  just enjoyed a picnic on the shore of Lake Bala and were returning home to the Midlands when the accident happened on June 1.  

Ms Lakin, from Tamworth, in Staffordshire, was riding her 600cc Yamaha Faser which she had nicknamed Bumblebee because of its striking black and yellow paintwork.

An ambulance was called but she was pronounced dead at the scene.

Her family said in a statement: 'Melanie was a keen motorcyclist who loved life, people, nature and animals especially her cats Hector and Cleo. 

'She was kind, caring and generous and had just completed her first year in diagnostic radiography at Birmingham City University.

'Melanie was looking forward to a successful career in the NHS, combining her love of helping people and a technical, visual subject.

'She had a keen eye and appreciation for photography, music and art and managed to combine all three by photographing some of her favourite bands and musicians at music festivals.'
