Will Brazil win the World Cup without Neymar?

Now share your opinion

In the end the parties on the ocean front at Avenue Beira Mar would go on through the night. Brazil wouldn’t have it any other way.

David Luiz made sure of that after his spectacular second half free-kick, straight out of Zico’s handbook, confirmed their place in the last four.

The whole place was rocking, with thumping samba music celebrating the country’s place in a World Cup semi-final against Germany.

Columbia were crushed before kick-off, unable to cope with a wall of noise. The atmosphere in this city was truly remarkable.

Their players were woken up yesterday morning by a loudspeaker repeatedly playing Hino Nacional Brasileiro outside their beachfront hotel in Fortaleza. 

The noise, the colour, the drama and the build-up was incredible.

Two miles down the road, in the Marina Park, thousands of street kids wearing Brazil kits were waiting outside the team hotel to wish them on their way.

It was there that Luiz Felipe Scolari paid a short visit to the small chapel in the grounds before they left for the game, turning to religion in his 90 minutes of need.

Football is the opium of the masses here, an obsession that takes them away from the hum of ordinary life and unites a nation of nearly 200m people for 90 steamy minutes.

Speak to them about the achievement of winning the World Cup and they will respond by saying 'e os outtos catorze' ('yes, but what of the other 14?'). They really believe they should win this tournament every time.

On Friday it was almost impossible to contain their fans as they pressed their faces against the fencing for a glimpse of Neymar, David Luiz or Thiago Silva when they walked out of the team hotel.

They had arrived the night before, when two Black Hawk helicopters buzzed the team bus with a searchlight and guided it through Fortaleza’s sweeping streets towards their lodgings.

It felt like showtime and the stadium, packed to the rafters with yellow shirts and those damned five stars, was absolutely rocking.

There was noise like you cannot imagine, a piercing sense of anticipation every time Neymar and the rest of these golden boys are anywhere near the ball. They coped magnificently.

The World Cup is not just about the best individual players or the squad with most ability, it’s about coping with the changing situations and demands of tournament football.

The early goal helped them. The captain Thiago Silva was under pressure, scrutinised like never before after opting out when it came to the penalty shootout against Chile in the second round.

He closed his eyes when he belted out the national anthem and all his dreams came true when he converted Neymar’s corner in the seventh minute.

It would be impossible to do justice to the noise inside the stadium and the celebrations that followed down by the corner flag. It was electrifying.

There was a constant buzz around the stadium, a unique blend of anticipation and fear that you get when your exam results arrive.

Just what if Colombia got their act together?  They couldn't cope. James Rodriguez, the star of the tournament with six goals now, was kicked out of it in the first half.

He was fouled four times before the break and Juan Cuadrado, Colombia’s other danger-man, three.

Brazil’s hatchet men had done a number on him. Fernandinho nailed him early and then it was a carousel of Brazil players waiting to have a crack at the Colombia forward.

It was a difficult evening for Rodriguez, particularly after his name was booed by Brazil’s supporters when his name was read out before the game.

This was Brazil showing their teeth, crashing into tackles to make sure they made it to the semi-final in Belo Horizonte. Until then, this place is one big party.
