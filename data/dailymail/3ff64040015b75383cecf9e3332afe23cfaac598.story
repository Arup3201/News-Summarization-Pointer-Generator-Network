The families of missing Utah mother Susan Powell are fighting over whether to declare she is now legally dead, five years after she vanished. 

The mother-of-two Susan Powell, 28, disappeared from her home in West Valley City in December 2009 and she has never been found.

Josh Powell claimed that his wife was at home when he took his sons, Charlie and Braden, on a winter camping trip in Utah's West Desert.

Mystery: Susan's husband Josh Powell killed himself and his two sons - 7-year-old Charlie and 5-year-old Braden - in 2012. He was long considered a person of interest in her disappearance but was never charged 

He was long considered a person of interest in her disappearance but was never charged in the case.

In 2012 Josh Powell attacked the couple's two young sons with a hatchet and then burned down his Graham, Washington home, with him and the boys inside.

Utah law says that someone 'who is absent for a continuous period of five years' is presumed to be dead and Saturday will mark five years since she vanished.

But her parents, Chuck and Judy Cox, who have long campaigned for justice, are now locked in a legal battle with Terrica and Alina Powell - Josh Powell’s mother and sister, respectively.

In Utah the date of death is considered to be the end of the time period 'unless there is sufficient evidence for determining that death occurred earlier,' the statute says. 

Chuck and Judy Cox do not want to request a death declaration from a judge.

'They have hope that maybe she'll be found or she's alive somewhere,' said Evan Bariault, a Seattle attorney for the Coxes, told the Salt Lake Tribune.

'I just don't think they're ready for a court to make that determination.' 

They are arguing over whether a judge should find Susan died sometime prior to May 10, 2013 - which is what Terrica and Alina Powell have requested.

That is the date Chuck Cox made changes to the legal trust belonging to his daughter and Josh - hw was allowed to make the alterations as he was a trustee appointed if Josh and Susan were dead or incapacitated.

His changes eliminated his late son-in-law's family as beneficiaries. 

In September, Utah 3rd District Judge L.A. Dever ruled the amendments to the trust did not comply with procedures outlined by the trust, including a requirement that he obtain opinions from two doctors saying Susan was incapacitated.

But he upheld the changes because the Powells did not object in time, although the Powells have appealed the ruling. 

Earlier this week it emerged that Steven Powell, the father-in-law of the missing mother has been sent back to jail for refusing to get sexual deviancy treatment as he awaits child porn charges.

The Cox family claims that Steven Powell has information about his missing daughter-in-law. It 

A Washington state judge ruled that the 64-year-old, who is from Tacoma, must go back to jail for at least 40 days, RadarOnline reported.

Saturday will mark five years since his daughter-in-law Susan vanished in Utah, which means she will be declared legally dead.  

In 2012, authorities searched a home he had previously shared with his father, Steven Powell, and allegedly found that the elder Powell had child pornography in his possession.

Back to jail: Steven Powell, seen in an old mug shot, is serving 40 days in jail for failing to get treatment

In May 2012 he was convicted of 14 counts of voyeurism for taking photos of two young neighbor girls in the bathroom and was sentenced to serve two-and-a-half years in June 2012.

He got out of Washington State prison in March after finishing up his sentence. 

But last month, prosecutors refiled a charge of possession of child pornography against him after an appeals court determined that the charge was wrongly dismissed during his original trial.

On his release from prison, Powell was ordered to complete a sexual deviancy treatment program and undergo a psycho-sexual evaluation.

He was also ordered to stay away from places where juveniles are typically found such as pools, parks, playgrounds and schools.

In July, police found Powell in a Jack in the Box fast-food restaurant and he was sentenced to nine days in jail for visiting an establishment frequented by minors, according to police reports.

In August, Powell's counselor 'terminated treatment' because Powell refused to cooperate with the psychosexual evaluation, according to the report.

His parole officer determined he was being 'manipulative,' and he was sentenced to three days in jail.

Powell again refused to answer questions about his sexual behavior during treatment in October, according to the report.

His parole officer recently asked the judge to sentence him to another 60 days behind bars, saying that he poses a 'continued risk to the community' for failing to undergo the treatment. 

Thousands of images of Susan Powell were seized from the home that Steve Powell was sharing with his son in 2011 by police serving a search warrant.

The images - some sexually suggestive - showed the missing Utah mother walking in public, doing the laundry or sitting in her car, apparently unaware that someone was taking her picture.

Steve Powell has never been charged with any crimes related to images of Susan Powell.
