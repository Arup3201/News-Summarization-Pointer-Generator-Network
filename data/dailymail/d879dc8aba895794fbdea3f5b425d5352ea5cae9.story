Gwynne Harford, 86, considered herself too old to go on a cruise ship but her friends convinced her otherwise and she had a great time until she cut her leg on the second last day of the trip.

The Gold Coast  pensioner returned home to Queensland the following day and ended up spending five days in Pindara hospital but the drama didn't end there.

The widow had to return to the emergency ward just 10 minutes after being discharged on Sunday when the driver of the maxi taxi, that the injured elderly lady was struggling to get into, slammed her left hand in the sliding door.

Gwynne Harford, 86, considered herself too old to go on a cruise ship but her friends convinced her otherwise and she had a great time until she cut her leg on the second last day of the trip

Gwynne told Daily Mail Australia that the driver must not have been looking when he closed the door because she was standing in the doorway attempting to pull herself up into the seat.

'I said to him "I can't get in here - I need help" but he was nowhere to be seen,' she said. 

'Then he must've appeared out of nowhere and slammed the door when I let out an almighty scream.'

In a lot of pain and shock, the Robina resident went straight back into the emergency department.

'There was blood everywhere - the girls at reception were horrified,' she said.

'The doctor said I could have lost the top of my finger.'

Gwynne, who received three stitches to her little finger, said she understood that the incident was a mistake but she was shocked that the driver didn't apologise.

'I saw the man's coat jacket as he put down my bags and then he turned around and walked out,' she said.

'He didn't utter a word, or say sorry, or ask how I was.'

Dr Paul Pluss told Daily Mail Australia that he called the Gold Coast Cabs company to file a complaint about the incident.

'The poor lady was smashed up in a cab  - I explained that I was a doctor and it wasn't a trivial matter but I couldn't talk to a supervisor - I was even hung up on a couple of times.'

'I was also getting a machine message on the complaints line saying someone will call me back in four days,' Dr Pluss said.

'It was very disappointing - they are supposed to be a serviced-based business who are looking after people.'

Dr Pluss said the company's CEO called him the next day to say the matter was being taken very seriously and the incident was under investigation.

He also said that the driver had already reported the accident to his work. 

Gwynne, who gets her stitches taken out on Tuesday - the day she turns 87 - is being a real trooper about the mishap and concedes things could have been much worse.

Her spirits are high considering the impressive octogenarian is used to doing everything for herself including cooking, cleaning, gardening, shopping and driving

'My leg and finger are both painful but there are thousands of people who are worse off than me so I don't feel so bad.' 

Her spirits are high considering the impressive octogenarian is used to doing everything for herself including cooking, cleaning, gardening, shopping and driving.

'I don't like to ask people for help unless I'm desperate because I'm used to being independent,' she said.

Daily Mail Australia contacted Gold Coast Cabs and has yet to have heard back.
