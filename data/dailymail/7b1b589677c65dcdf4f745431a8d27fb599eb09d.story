A Las Vegas teacher has sparked controversy for letting two students dress in Ku Klux Klan costumes for a class presentation on U.S history.

The two Las Vegas Academy of the Arts juniors, who haven't been named, were given the go ahead to dress in white robes and hooded masks on January 9 for an assignment, which involved either writing a research paper or expressing their knowledge through art, dance or a first-person narrative.

The students were allegedly told not to wear the KKK costumes outside the classroom but one did and a photograph taken of him by shocked peers was posted on social media and quickly spread through the school community.

According to the Las Vegas Sun, school officials received several complaints after the image was posted online.

Clark County School District officials investigated and the Las Vegas Academy principal Scott Walker sent parents a letter calling the incident 'unfortunate.'

'While the presentation was designed to highlight the atrocities committed by the Klan, and there was no intention to harm or offend on the part of the students, it was in poor judgment and inappropriate for students to go to such lengths to convey their message,' he said.

The social studies teacher hasn't been identified and the teacher, nor the students, have been disciplined after the incident. District communications officer, Amanda Fulkerson, called it a personnel matter.

School officials and community members in Las Vegas said they don't fault the educator and several students, parents, teachers and one school board member backed the teacher at a meeting.

'This teacher has my support,' said Clark County school Trustee Linda Young, the only black and minority school board member.

Young noted that she didn't receive complaints from the public, and said she believed the teacher meant no harm.

Esther Langston, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas, professor emeritus with the Delta Sigma Theta black sorority and educational organization, said the teacher needed the academic freedom to educate students in a creative fashion.

Clark County School District equity and diversity chief Greta Peay said teachers must prepare carefully before and after a potentially controversial lesson to avoid misunderstandings.

The Sun reported the same performing arts magnet high school came under public scrutiny last year after theater students used the N-word during a production of 'Big River: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.'

The same teacher who let students wear KKK costumes also permitted students to dress as Adolf Hitler in other assignments, the newspaper said.

Officials said that since August 2012, more than 6,500 of the district's 18,000 teachers have taken voluntary diversity training classes, mostly after school and on weekends.
