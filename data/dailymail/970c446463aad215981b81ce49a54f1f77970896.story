A new advertising campaign by UN Women has used Google searches to reveal the reality of widespread sexism on the internet.

Based on searches on March 9, 2013, the adverts expose the negative attitudes ranging from stereotyping as well as a denial of women's rights. 

When the words 'women cannot' was typed into the search box, Google's predictive suggestions came up with 'women cannot drive', 'women cannot be bishops' 'women cannot be trusted' and 'women cannot speak in church'.

When someone typed 'women shouldn't' into the search box, suggestions included 'women shouldn't have rights', 'women shouldn't vote', 'women shouldn't work' and 'women shouldn't box'.

The text appears over the mouths of women as if to silence their voices. 

The adverts were designed for U.N. Women by Memac Ogilvy & Mather Dubai.

Christopher Hunt, Ogilvy & Mather's art director, said: 'When we came across these searches, we were shocked by how negative they were and decided we had to do something with them.'

Kareem Shuhaibar, copy writer, said: 'The ads are shocking because they show just how far we still have to go to achieve gender equality. 

'They are a wake up call, and we hope that the message will travel far.'

UN Women said it hopes the searches will confirm the urgent need to continue making the case for women's rights, empowerment and equality.

In July 2010, the United Nations General Assembly created UN Women, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.

Grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the UN Charter, U.N. Women, among other issues, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls and the empowerment of women.
