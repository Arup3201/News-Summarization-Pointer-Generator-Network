A teenager died following a violent fit that struck her just 20 minutes after she coloured her hair.

Tabatha McCourt, 17, began pulling at her shoulder-length locks, screaming and vomiting before collapsing in agony at a friend’s house.

Medics are investigating the possibility that she had a rare allergic reaction to a chemical in the dye.

Died: Tabatha McCourt collapsed looking like a 'rag doll' minutes after dyeing her hair last month

Her best friend Heather Goodhall said they had been enjoying a ‘girlie’ night watching the X Factor before the tragedy on Saturday.

‘Tabatha was always dyeing her hair different colours,’ said Heather. ‘The dye had only been in around 20 minutes when she got up and went to the bathroom.

‘She came back a couple of minutes later, sat down on the seat, and then began frantically pulling the foils from her hair.

‘She started shouting, “no, no” and my mum’s boyfriend held her and tried to calm her down. It was really scary.

‘Her eyes started going all funny and then she just started being sick. She looked just like a rag doll, limp, just lying there.’

Tributes: Balloons and flowers are placed outside Tabatha McCourt's home. Police said her death is unexplained

Tragedy: More tributes outside Tabatha's home. Her best friend Heather Goodhall called 999 but paramedics who came to the house were unable to save her

Tabatha was taken to Monklands General Hospital, Lanarkshire, following the incident in Airdrie, but she later died.

A tearful Heather added: ‘It all seems like it’s not real. ‘Tabatha was a great friend, so generous and full of life, always hyper and bubbly.

‘She had the biggest heart and was a really lovely person.

‘We were planning to have a joint 18th birthday party next year. I can’t believe she is gone.’

Tabatha lived with her parents Margaret and Peter and sisters Tiffany, 15, and Jasmine, 11.

Her youngest sister posted on Facebook: ‘RIP big sister. I know you are gone but you will always be in my heart. Love you so much xx.’

Friends and relatives have piled notes and floral tributes at the family’s home in Airdrie.

Police said the death was unexplained and a post-mortem examination would be carried out.

A chemical called p-Phenylenediamine has reportedly been suggested as a possible cause for the sudden reaction.

Emma Meredith, head of scientific research at the Cosmetic Toiletry and Perfumery Association, explained it is used in many dyes that darken hair.

‘To have such an immediate and violent reaction to this or any other cosmetic product is exceedingly rare,’ she said.

‘We don’t know if Tabatha had any predisposition to allergies but any kind of reaction would be more likely in that case.

‘This is an awful and unfortunate event and our thoughts are with Tabatha’s family.’

Miss Meredith urged consumers to check product instructions before use. Many advise doing an allergy test 48 hours before use.
