The WGC Match Play will move to Austin, Texas, in 2016 after the International Federation of PGA Tours announced a new four-year title sponsorship deal with Dell.

This year's event, sponsored by Cadillac, will take place in San Francisco - beginning on April 29 - as Jason Day looks to defend the title he won in a thrilling final against Victor Dubuisson last year.

In 2016, the event will not only move location but also time as it is moved to the week beginning March 21, with the host course yet to be announced.

'We couldn't be more pleased to welcome Dell as a sponsor of the World Golf Championships and, beginning in 2016, as the new title sponsor of the Match Play,' said PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem in a statement on behalf of the International Federation of PGA Tours.

'The Match Play has a tremendous future with Dell as the incoming title sponsor, the event's move to Austin and the new round-robin format that is being introduced this year.'

Dell chairman and chief executive officer Michael Dell added: 'We're excited to sponsor the Match Play Championship, to showcase Dell technology to golf fans and to bring the world's greatest golfers to our hometown, Austin, Texas.

'We're also proud to support the championship's tradition of philanthropy that has raised millions of dollars for charitable causes.'

The tournament will be known as the World Golf Championships-Dell Match Play until 2019.
