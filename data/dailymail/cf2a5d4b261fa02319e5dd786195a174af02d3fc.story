Criminals should be allowed to sit as justices of the peace for the first time in more than 700 years, a prominent think tank said yesterday. 

They should win the right to apply to become magistrates five years after committing their last crime, according to the centre-right Policy Exchange group.

The organisation, which has close links to David Cameron, said that appointing former offenders would ‘overhaul’ the magistrates’ courts which deal with 19 out of every 20 criminal cases.

Changes: The Policy Exchange group said the changes would 'overhaul' magistrates' courts which currently deal with 19 out of 20 criminal cases

More than half of all JPs are over 60 and the magistracy is ‘overwhelmingly white, middle class and old’, a report by the think tank said.

It also recommended that, to help with the turnover of JPs, no magistrate should serve for more than 10 years. This will ‘inject greater innovation and dynamism into the courts system’, the Policy Exchange said.

The scheme would sweep away the rule which since the reign of Edward l has insisted that magistrates must be ‘good and lawful men’.

But critics said that opening the criminal bench to recent offenders would undermine trust in the honesty of magistrates and introduce the possibility of criminal sentencing motivated by corruption or revenge.

Magistrates have wide powers to set fines and community punishments and to hand down shorter prison sentences. They regularly deal with offences such as burglary and they can impose maximum jail terms of six months.

But Policy Exchange said former 
offenders would be especially well-suited to working in the 
‘problem-solving’ specialist drug courts set up under the last Labour 
government, because they will understand ‘complex issues faced by those 
with addictions and mental health problems.’

The
report said that ‘there needs to be an overhaul of the magistracy, 
which presides over more than 90 per cent of criminal cases. This should
be driven by the involvement of ex-offenders who have turned away from 
crime and become respected, positive role models in their communities.

‘The
lay magistracy is overwhelmingly white, middle class and old, with 55.5
per cent of magistrates over the age of 60 and just 3.2 per cent of 
them under the age of 40,’ it added.

It
pointed to the drug courts established in some cities from 2004 onwards
as suitable benches for former criminals, where ‘judges and magistrates
take a more personalised approach to solve offenders’ problems.’

Max Chambers of Policy Exchange said: ‘We want to see more courts adopting this innovative approach to dealing with crime. Tackling offenders’ issues in court and holding them accountable for their progress is about moving from assembly-line justice to problem-solving justice.

‘Magistrates could be the key to making it happen. They’ve been the pillars of our communities since their creation 650 years ago, but in today’s world whether you’re allowed to become a magistrate has got to be about more than whether you move in the same social circles as other magistrates.’

He added: ‘We need to open this system up to those with first-hand experience of what addiction and the criminal justice system are really like. Who better to help turn offenders’ around and make our streets safer than someone who’s been through it, come out the other side and is now making a positive contribution to society?’

But criminologist David Green of the Civitas think tank said: ‘I do not see what is wrong with experience. It is important that the courts do have experience, which means the wool can’t be pulled over the judge’s eyes, something that is a problem with our courts at the moment.

‘There are good reasons for rules that say criminals cannot be magistrates. If someone has crime in their past it can indicate lack of honesty or integrity. The courts need honesty and integrity, and any sign that they are not there is a good reason for never allowing someone to sit as a magistrate.’

Dr Green added: ‘The Policy Exchange are not giving proper weight to the role of the justice system in society. There must be no doubt that magistrates are not only honest, but that they have a judicial temperament, which means they can put their own views to one side and they will not be tempted to act in vengeance.

‘Other countries don’t have that and it is very important. This report is casual about upholding of appointing judges and magistrates with the right qualities, and for that reason the report is no more than posturing.’

Policy Exchange, which has exchanged a number of staff with Mr Cameron’s Downing Street, launched its report with former Friends sitcom star Matthew Perry, who helps publicise US drug courts.

‘We are increasingly seeing the use of former addicts as magistrates and judges in helping to turn people’s lives around,’ Mr Perry said. ‘Drug courts and sobriety courts save lives and taxpayer dollars,’ he added.

Longstanding rules say that people may not become magistrates if they have criminal convictions, including motoring convictions. They can also be barred from the bench if their spouse or partner has a criminal record.
