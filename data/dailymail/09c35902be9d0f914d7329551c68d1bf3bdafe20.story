Two California office workers expected, at the most, to have to call a plumber when their office toilet became clogged Tuesday. Instead, they had to call the county's Department of Animal Services.

Stephanie Lacsa and Holly Wells of Vertical PR & Marketing in San Diego noticed the water level in the toilet of the second-floor restroom was higher than usual Tuesday, according to the LA Times. 

And when Lacsa went to plunge it, the water level didn't go down. Instead, a 5 1/2 foot snake came up.

Curled Up: Stephanie Lacsa went to plunge her office toilet Tuesday and a 5 1/2 foot Columbian rainbow boa slithered out of the toilet and curled up in the stall

Columbian Rainbow Boa: The snake was identified as a 5 1/2-foot-6-inches-around Columbian rainbow boa, native to Columbia and northern regions of South America

'I thought my eyes were deceiving me,' Lasca said of the moment she saw the snake's tongue flicker in the toilet. 

 Lacsa screamed and ran from the bathroom, taping the door shut before she called animal services, FOX news reports. 

An animal services employee arrived to find a Columbian rainbow boa curled up behind the toilet. The employee expects the snake had been in sewers for weeks, NBC reports, as it was underweight and shedding. 

Wells was a bit skeptical when Lacsa first told her of the slithering situation.

'[Lacsa] said, 'It's the size of my forearm,'' Wells told NBC, 'and I was like, 'No, it's the probably the size of a pencil.'

But when Wells cracked the door, she saw it for herself: A more than 5-foot-long and 6-inches-around boa. 

The animal services employee was even shocked, telling NBC the situation was 'the stuff of urban legends.'

Animal Services Deputy Director Dan DeSousa told NBC that when in the care of animal services, the snake got 'nippy' and bit its handler. 

Exaggerating: Lacsa (left) ran out of the stall, taped the door shut and told Holly Wells (right) of her experience, but Wells thought her co-worker was exaggerating 

Facebook: Wells took to Facebook to describe the experience saying 'Happy New Years to us' 

Pet: Lacsa said she wonders if the old pipes in the building, built in the 1800's are to blame, NBC reports. But county animal services says the snake is most likely someone's pet (here, an animal services employee plays with the snake)

The agency took the snake to an animal center for examination, the Times reports.

If no one claims the snake by Friday, the boa will be given to a rescue group. 

Lacsa said she wonders if the old pipes in the building, built in the 1800's are to blame, NBC reports. But county animal services says the snake is most likely someone's pet. 

Where the snake came from and how it got into the toilet is still a mystery, as the Columbian rainbow boa is native to Columbia and northern regions of South America. 

It seems Lacsa and Wells weren't in much danger though. The Columbian rainbow boa is said to be the most 'calm and good tempered' of all the different species of rainbow boa.
