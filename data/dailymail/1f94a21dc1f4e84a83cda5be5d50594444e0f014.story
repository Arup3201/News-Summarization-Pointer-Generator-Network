Anthony Crolla has revealed he received a phone call from Sir Alex Ferguson after he was assaulted by burglars.

The 28-year-old suffered a fractured skull and a broken ankle in a confrontation with two alleged burglars he spotted fleeing a neighbour's back garden in Chadderton, Greater Manchester.

Crolla was hit with a concrete slab during the altercation and required a plate and pin in his ankle and 12 stitches to a head wound.

The lifelong Manchester United fan is on the mend, but has been forced to pull out of January's WBA world lightweight title bout against Richar Abril.

However, Sir Alex has been in touch to wish the fighter a speedy recovery. 

Crolla told Sky Sports: 'My phone rang and I was with my trainer Joe [Gallagher]. I honestly thought it was a wind up because that's what my mates are like. 

'I was going to put the phone down but then I realised it was him and couldn't believe it. It's nice of Sir Alex to ring me. I was a bit star struck on the phone.'

Crolla has vowed to come back stronger than ever and is confident he can get another title shot once he returns to full fitness.

He added: 'I was heartbroken because it was something I had worked so long for.

'It was like my dream had been taken away from me. I look at it now and it's been put back - postponed - to a later date. 

'Once I do that I will come back stronger and get that world title shot again.'

Crolla says he has been overwhelmed by the support he has received since the ordeal, adding: 'I don't want to sound cheesy or anything like that. It was just the natural thing to do. If someone is burgling your neighbour's house you would help.

'I remember it all really clearly, I wasn't knocked out or anything like that. It is the next sort of bit that I don't remember. I woke up the next day and wondered what happened. 

'It was a little bit unfortunate. I'm told I'm lucky to be here - I'm lucky to be home with my family for Christmas.'
