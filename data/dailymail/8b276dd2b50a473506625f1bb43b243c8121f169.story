Two men have been dramatically arrested after a policeman who was on his way to work recognised them as possible suspects in a spate of armed robberies nearly 50km away.

The senior constable, who was on his way to Macquarie Fields, called for backup after spotting the men in a white car about 2.15pm on Saturday in Penrith, west of Sydney.

He followed the men until several police responded and the vehicle was pulled over near the corner of the Northern Road and Maxwell Street.
