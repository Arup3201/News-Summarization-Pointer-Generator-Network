A sugar tax may have to be imposed on calorie-laden food and drink to tackle the nation's obesity epidemic, the chief medical officer warned yesterday.

Dame Sally Davies said that increasing the prices of certain products, particularly fruit juice and fizzy drinks, could be the only way to change the public's poor diet.

Being overweight had become 'normalised', with shops altering the dimensions of their clothes so that people do not realise they are getting fatter.

Dame Sally said she thought that research 'will find that sugar is addictive', and warned that the crisis is now so severe that today's children will possibly have a lower life expectancy than their parents' generation.

The idea that sugar, rather than fat, causes both obesity and diabetes is gaining support among diet and health experts.

In January an alliance of doctors and academics described sugar as 'the new tobacco', blaming it for a range of health problems and early death.

The typical Briton consumes 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and some adults consume as many as 46.

Currently just over a quarter of adults are obese, up from only 8 per cent in 1980.

But experts say this figure is expected to more than double by 2050, and there is particular concern about the number of obese children.

Dame Sally did not specify how much tax would be added to sweet food and drinks, but experts have previously suggested the rate should be 20 per cent.

This would mean a Mars Bar would go up from 60p to 72p, a can of coke from 70p to 84p and a carton of fruit juice from £1.50 to £1.80

She also did not go into details about which products would be taxed, but experts have previously stated that a sugar content of 15 per cent is too high.

Addressing MPs on the health select committee, Dame Sally, the chief medical officer for England, said: 'What we are comes off our plate – it is calories. So we will need to continue to explore how we can help people to reduce their calories and that gets you in to culture.

Nikki Oakley became so addicted to sugar that she consumed the equivalent of 50  teaspoons a day – but she has transformed her life by kicking the habit.

The 45-year-old gorged on chocolate biscuits or sugar-laden cereal bars for breakfast, followed by sandwiches, crisps and cakes for lunch and ready meals followed by a pudding in the evening. She shunned tea and coffee during the day in favour of sugary fizzy drinks.

Mrs Oakley said her addiction was so severe that she was left in tears, short-tempered, listless and depressed and  suffering from headaches after quitting the 'white stuff' last September.

'It took a fortnight for those feelings to subside,' said the mother of two, from Redditch, Worcestershire.

'It was a cycle – I ate sugary foods as a pick-me-up, but after the high came a low and I would need more. But once I'd got through those first few weeks, I started to feel so much better.'

The keen jogger said she was running faster than ever and had lost 18lb.

'I think the science is going such that we will find that sugar is addictive. I don't think we've managed to get over to the public how calorie-packed fruit juices, smoothies and sodas are.

'We need to think about reformulation [changing what's in products], but we also need to have a re-education so that the public know that one's fine but not lots of them. So we may need to move towards some form of sugar tax, but I hope we don't have to.'

She also said clothing manufacturers had changed their dress sizes so the public would not realise they were getting fatter. A woman who fitted in to size 14 clothes now would actually have been a size 16 in the 1970s. 'I worry that we have resized women's dress sizes, so we have normalised being overweight,' she said.

'We have to look at a way not of ostracizing people who are obese and making them feel bad about themselves but somehow making them understand and realise this is pathological and will cause them harm.'

She also said that today's children could be the first to have lower life expectancies than their parents.

The average life expectancy has increased over the generations due to better standards of living and medical advances but obesity threatens to reverse this trend, she said.

'We have generation of children who because of their weight and lack of activity will not live as long as my generation,' she added. 'It will be the first generation that live less. That is of great concern.'

In January a report by the National Obesity Forum warned that dire predictions that half the nation will be too fat by 2050 were in fact an underestimate.

It said the obesity epidemic could be far worse than predicted because experts did not factor in how much fatter we are getting as we age – and the extent of the problem in children.
