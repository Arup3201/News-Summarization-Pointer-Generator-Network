Paintings by a British prisoner-of-war which he used to secretly mock his obese and goose-stepping German captors have gone on display for the first time.

Lieutenant Colonel Reginald Bond spent his days creating beautiful watercolours and caricatures of guards and officers at his WWI camp.

He would draw his enemy looking ridiculous - including grossly fat ones marching across the yard, with huge moustaches and one as half man, half dog.

Lieutenant Colonel Reginald Bond spent his days creating beautiful watercolours and caricatures of guards and officers at his WWI camp in Magdeburg, Germany - including this one, entitled Fat Guard

The paintings (including above, The Old Guard) in which Lt Col Bond mocked his obese and goose-stepping German captors have gone on display for the first time

Lt Col Bond, an officer from Marlborough, Wiltshire, spent six months in a prisoner camp in 1915 and used his time to observe his fellow inmates and guards.

Captured and transported to Magdeburg PoW camp in Germany, he found himself with hours of free time because, as an officer, he was not required to undertake manual labour.

Many of Bond's paintings show the humdrum side of life as a PoW with fellow soldiers shown reading and eating while they pass the hours.

But his artwork also includes unflattering watercolours of overweight and greedy guards.

Bond also drew several images of the Magdeburg skyline, or at least what he could see of it over the walls of the prison.

Now, his story and sketches have been made available for the first time, 100 years on.

They have been made available for free online as part of the Soldiers' Stories series on the National Army Museum's commemorative portal, First World War in Focus.

A spokesperson for the National Army Museum said: 'Bond spent over six months observing both his fellow prisoners and his captors.

'He recorded them in a series of brilliantly preserved watercolours and sketches, providing a unique insight into daily life in captivity.

Bond was commissioned into the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry at the age of 22 and was 48 when war broke out in 1914. Above, his pencil sketch, A British Officer In His Hut At Magdeburg Camp

At the outbreak of the First World War, the British Army was, unlike forces fielded by many other nations, composed exclusively of volunteers and was much smaller than its French and German counterparts.

As fighting began in Europe, Britain could boast only a relatively small force of 400,000 soldiers - over half of which were posted around the world to garrison the Empire.

The first army sent to the Western Front was known as the British Expeditionary Force, which was formed for service in France and became known as the Old Contemptibles.

By the end of 1914 — after the battles of Mons, the Le Cateau, the Aisne and Ypres — the old regular British Army had been wiped out, although it managed to help stop the German advance, and more men were needed.

That marked the beginning of the famous recruitment drive fronted by General Kitchener which in 1914–1915 assembled the volunteers destined to go into action at the Battle of the Somme.

Conscription was only introduced in 1916 and, by the end of 1918, the Army had reached its maximum strength of 4,000,000 men and could field over 70 divisions, many of which were drawn from colonies like India.

'Hundreds of miles away from the action of the trenches, officers - unlike ordinary soldiers - were not required to engage in manual labour for their captors, and often found themselves with endless hours of free time to occupy.

'Such personal accounts are being unveiled each month on the Soldiers' Stories series.

'They piece together the development of the war from the point of view of those directly involved - 100 years from the time that they describe.

'We hope that in sharing these personal stories, the human scale and impact of The Great War can be better felt and understood.'

Lt Col Bond was the son of a vicar and was born in Marlborough on April 28, 1866.

He was commissioned into the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry at the age of 22 and was 48 when war broke out in 1914.

He was in command of the regiment's second battalion at the outbreak of war and led them during the Battle of Mons, before being captured at Le Cateau on August 26, 1914.

His family was told that he was dead and held a memorial service in his honour before they found out the truth.

He was taken to Magdeburg six months later where he remained for the duration of the war until Armistice Day on November 11, 1918.

Bond retired from the Army in 1919 and lived in Clare, Suffolk.

He went on to write a book, Prisoners Grave And Gay, and also continued to paint. He died on June 13, 1936. 

First World War in Focus is part of the National Army Museum's Building for the Future project which is supported by an £11.5million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
