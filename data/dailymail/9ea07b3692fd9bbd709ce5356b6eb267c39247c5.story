Everyone cares about their personal safety, but when queuing to see a World Cup game, or before boarding a plane, lengthy security measures can seem like a drag.

A new security checkpoint, which resembles hi-tech honeycomb, promises to speed up this tedious process - and has already proved a success at the Arena da Baixada stadium in Curitiba, Brazil.

The machine scans the contents of bags in seconds to detect weapons and chemicals - without guests having to open them up -  and can also process tickets for events, five customers at a time.

A new security checkpoint (pictured), which resembles hi-tech honeycomb, promises to speed up the tedious process of checking bags. It scans the bags and processes up to five tickets at a time to get football fans into stadiums faster

The scanner processes tickets for events, and scans bags at the same time to cut security queues.

People open one of the doors and place their closed bag inside, before walking round it and collecting the bag at the other side, which has been security checked in a matter of seconds.

It was trialled at the Arena da Baixada stadium in Curitiba, Brazil for the World Cup.

It can handle five customers at a time.

Less security staff are needed as a result of using the machine and it helps protect people's privacy.

There are no details about how the machine works exactly, but it uses multiple sensors and an artificial intelligence algorithm to analyse the contents of people's bags to spot weapons and chemicals.

The company behind the scanner says it will be rolled out at more stadiums and possibly airports in the future.

Qylur Security Systems, based in Silicon Valley, California, deployed its Qylatron Entry Experience Solution for security screening at the stadium, which has a capacity of 43,900.

‘The Qylatron automated detection system not only provided highly reliable bag screening, it also put fans "back in charge" of their own belongings as the nature of the Qylatron allowed fans to place their items into the honeycomb shaped device - that conducts five concurrent bag scans - and expedite their entry into the stadium,’ said Hugo Ramos, director for Agogo Marketing Promocional, which organised the security for some of the World Cup stadiums.

‘Rather than having stadium officials hand search personal bags, the Qylatron protects the personal dignity of fans and preserves the entertaining aspects of mass sporting events like the World Cup.’

The system is designed to speed up the process of people getting into large sporting events and pop concerts, and could be tried out at airports In the future.

To use the device, people open one of the doors in the hexagon and place their bag inside.

They then walk round to the other side of the large device, by which time their bag has been scanned.

At the same time, the machine can also process people’s tickets.

And because there are lots of security scanners in the one unit, five customers can go through the security check at once.

The company claims the machine is the first to combine the initial greeting and ticketing experience for fans, with security screening.

It added that the Oylatron scans the tickets and bags with far greater efficiency than humans, can detect security threats, improve guest experience and cut security costs by up to 50 per cent.

The California Company has not disclosed exactly how the machine works but says it uses a ‘fusion of multiple sensors’ to check for certain chemicals and materials.

Its artificial intelligence algorithm analyses ‘sensory output’ in a bid to eliminate ‘all too frequent human error, ensuring higher detection rates, reducing false alarms while maintaining very high efficiency.’

‘Equipped with an intelligent, threat-learning engine and ongoing updates, the Qylatron is able to respond to ever-evolving threats, both locally and globally,’ it said.

Lisa Dolev, CEO and founder of Qylur  said: ‘We heard from dozens of soccer fans at the World Cup about how much fun they had personally interacting with the Qylatron.

‘This is especially gratifying as it validates the core principle of why I founded Qylur -- to preserve human liberty while offering the most advanced security-screening technology in the industry.’
