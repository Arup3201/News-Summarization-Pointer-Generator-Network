Southampton are poised to complete a £7million deal for keeper Fraser Forster if Celtic crash out of the Champions League on Wednesday night.

The Scottish champions are 4-1 down from the first leg of their third round Champions League qualifying clash with Legia Warsaw.

And with £15million on the line in the return at Murrayfield, coach Ronny Deila admits the consequences of failure could be player sales - with Forster first out the door and Virgil van Dijk, Adam Matthews and Kris Commons also being monitored by Premier League clubs.

'It’s possible,' said Deila. 'If some are leaving then, okay, you need to get some in to replace them. That’s how football clubs work and I have never been to a club which hasn’t lost players. But I will also get some players in.'

Southampton are talking to Inter Milan winger Ezequiel Schelotto and have agreed terms with Inter for Saphir Taider.
