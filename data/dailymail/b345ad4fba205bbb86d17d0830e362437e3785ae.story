Millions dream of owning a pretty country cottage with a garden and a beautiful view.

But for most of us the rural dream will remain just that, not least because of the soaring cost of living in the countryside, according to a report yesterday by Halifax.

The bank’s report reveals the average price of a home in rural areas is £202,000, compared with the £172,000 average in an urban area.

The ‘rural premium’ of £30,000 is more than the average full-time worker earns in a whole year.

Turville village in the Chilterns, Buckinghamshire: The area is the most expensive rural hotspot, which is close enough to London for commuters to live in the countryside but work in the capital

The soaring price of living in the countryside has been dubbed ‘the River Cottage effect’, after the Channel 4 series featuring chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall growing his food in his own rural idyll.

‘Country living is an aspiration for many Britons – the fresh air, the scenery, the slower pace,’ said Halifax housing economist Martin Ellis.

‘It all adds to the attraction, but this has its drawbacks. For many of those tempted, the high prices put rural homes out of their reach.

‘The traditional British country pile has become less affordable.

‘It is proving more and more difficult to find fruitful results when foraging for houses in the country.’

One ‘country pile’ advertised in this 
week’s exclusive Country Life magazine is an eight-bedroom manor house 
near Petersfield, Hampshire, which costs £4million.

The
most expensive rural hotspot is in the Chilterns, which is close enough
to London for commuters to live in the countryside but work in the 
capital.

For the past decade, the average house price in the area has increased by £1,107 every month. In 2002, you could buy a home in the area for £295,000. Today the same property would cost £428,000.

Another big winner is the Cotswolds, which includes famous towns such as Stow-on-the-Wold, Cirencester, Bourton-on-the-Water, Moreton-in-Marsh and Tetbury, which is near Prince Charles’s Highgrove home.

The average house price there is £283,700, just over eight times the average salary of a local resident, which is £34,811.

The Halifax report is based on average house prices in local authorities in the UK. A home is defined as ‘rural’ if it is in a  town or village with a population under 10,000.

Overall, it found only one in 17 of Britain’s 111 rural local authority districts are ‘affordable’. To be affordable, the ratio of house  prices to local earnings must be below four.

A spokesman from rural affairs campaign group the Countryside Alliance said: ‘The significant difference in house prices will come as no surprise to the thousands of people currently unable to get on to the housing ladder in  rural Britain.

‘Many simply cannot afford to live in the areas where they grew up, causing concerns that rural communities may disintegrate as people are forced to move away, often into towns where housing is more affordable.

‘The Countryside Alliance cannot overstate the importance of kick-starting the housebuilding programme, because the future of our rural communities depends on it.’
