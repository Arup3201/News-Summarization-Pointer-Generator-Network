Thousands of travellers are arriving in the small Cumbrian town of Appleby this morning as they prepare to take part in the annual horse fair.

The week-long event attracts members of the gypsy community from around the world, and has previously been featured in popular Channel 4 show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding.

However this year's Appleby Horse Fair has already been hit by a row over an 'invasion', as a large number of traveller families have pitched cars, caravans and horse buggies on the town's privately owned golf course.

Spectacle: Residents stared as the travellers arrived this morning for the week-long trade event by taking their horses and carts onto the main roads

King James II granted a Royal Charter in 1685 allowing a horse fair to be held 'near the River Eden', and every year thousands of travellers come from around Britain and the rest of the world to take part.

The horse fair, which runs from today until next Wednesday, is the largest and one of the oldest fairs of its kind anywhere in Europe. Travellers and horse dealers gather at Appleby, in Westmorland, in the Eden Valley, Cumbria, to meet old friends, conduct business, but primarily to trade horses.

Traditionally they bathe the horses in the River Eden before grooming them and riding them fast along the 'mad mile' to show them off to potential buyers.

As well as horses, the fair also features market stalls selling food and other merchandise, as well as fortune telling, palm reading and other live entertainment.

Activities: With thousands of horses gathered, travellers take them into the lakes surrounding the plush fields between striking deals to buy or sell

Roots: A young traveller in a flat cap and tweed jacket is seen driving a simple buggy along a country road near Appleby. The horse fair, which runs from today until next Wednesday, is the largest and one of the oldest fairs of its kind anywhere in Europe

History: Many travellers wear traditional dress during the week-long event. King James II granted a Royal Charter in 1685 allowing a horse fair to be held 'near the River Eden', and every year thousands of travellers come from around the world to take part

Learning the business: A young traveller and his father bring one of their horses under control.  Every year thousands of travellers gather in the town to trade the animals. Traditionally they bathe the horses in the River Eden before grooming them and riding them fast along the 'mad mile' to show them off to potential buyers

The event remains one of the largest and oldest events in Europe and gives the opportunity for travelling communities to meet friends, celebrate their music, folklore

Tradition: Trevor Jones from the Wirral has a cup of tea as he sits on the steps of his Bow top wagon where gypsies gather to buy and sell horses

Buy or sell: The festival took over the entire town, with horses tied up to barriers along the streets for would-be buyers to have a look at

Ahead of 
this year's fair, pubs and off-licences in Appleby have agreed to limit 
opening hours in the hope of reducing anti-social behaviour.

It
 is thought that up to 10,000 travellers and an additional 30,000 
spectators will arrive in the small town over the next few days.

The sheer number of people, plus previous incidents of drink-related disorder, have encouraged local businesses to agree to only serve alcohol between midday and 11pm over the course of the week. 

Police are out in force to control the event, which caused havoc last year. Pubs and restaurants have agreed to stop selling alcohol at 11pm to quell the hype

While many bring their horses and other fare in wheel-driven caravans, locals cart over the Eden valley in rickety carts that perilously scale the hills

Anger: The Appleby Horse Fair has already been hit by a row over an 'invasion', as a large number of traveller families have pitched cars, caravans and horse buggies on the market town's privately owned golf course. The fair runs until next Wednesday, so it is unlikely the vehicles will be moving anytime soon

Perfect pitch: The arrival of the travellers at the golf course has caused anger among local residents. Every year Appleby suffers from drink-related disorder, anti-social behaviour and a build-up of discarded litter and human waste during the week-long event

Large numbers: It is thought that up to 10,000 travellers and an additional 30,000 spectators will arrive in the small town over the next few days. Ahead of this year's fair, pubs and off-licences in Appleby have agreed to limit opening hours in the hope of reducing anti-social behaviour

Trouble: Police keep a close on those taking part in the Appleby Horse Fair. The event has gained a reputation for violence in recent years, leading to a heavy police presence. Last year officers arrested around 20 people who were on their way to Appleby on suspicion of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm

The Appleby Horse Fair has been held every year in early June since 1685 when King James II granted a Royal charter in 1685 allowing a horse fair 'near to the River Eden'.

However many gypsy historians say it has been taking place for at least 500 years with some believing it goes all the way back to Roman times.

Originally an event for trading livestock of all types it became known as a specialist horse fair owing to its popularity among gypsy traders.

It traditionally begins on the first Thursday after the first Tuesday in June and ends on the following Wednesday.

In 1965 Westmorland Borough Council attempted to shut down the event but were forced to back down after a huge outcry.

Deals are made by one-to-one bartering rather than a traditional auction and are clinched with a slap on the hand.

Robin 
Hooper, Eden District Council's chief executive, said: 'A great deal of 
preparation has gone into the planning of this year's fair to help 
people enjoy the event safely.'

'This
 work includes pubs and off licenses signing up to a voluntary charter 
and having the street cleansing operation in place throughout the fair, 
so that the impact of this event on the local community is minimized as 
much as possible,' he added.

With its rolling hillsides and lush green pastures the countryside around Appleby is some of the most beautiful in Britain.

But last year's event was blighted after some of the travellers left piles of rubbish, including used nappies and broken bottles strewn around hedges and fields prompting a flurry of complaints from locals.

With bin bags, cardboard boxes and scraps of food lining the hedgerows and roadsides, local people and the authorities faced a massive clean-up operation.

Many were left furious with the mess left behind with some accusing Eden District Council of not doing enough to clean up.

One irate local described the scene as being like 'an open sewer' claiming the portable toilets were overflowing.

The man, who did not wish to be named, said: 'They got serviced once a day.

'They are filthy and overflowing. You wouldn't let your dog use them.'

Mr Hooper said that, in response to these concerns, Eden District Council has allocated additional street cleaning facilities both during the fair and to assist the clean-up operation afterwards.

The event has also gained a reputation for violence.

Last year police arrested around 20 people who were on their way to Appleby on suspicion of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm.

That followed a series of bare knuckle brawls in 2011 when several arrests were made.

The 2009 event saw over 100 arrests mostly for drunkenness, drugs and disorder with police seizing cocaine, cannabis and 127 ball bearing guns.

27 of the arrests were made after rival gangs were involved in a mass brawl.

Entire clans come together to the specialist horse fair, where deals are made by a slap on the hand and a simple exchange of livestock

Thoroughfare: Horses were not the only animals to sweep the Cumbrian town - this woman, and many others, also brought household pets such as dogs

Despite the cast-over weather, travelling and Romany crowds flocked to the fields to parade their caravans, a tradition dating back to 1685

Preparations: The fair is Europe's largest gathering of Gypsies which the community spends months preparing for
