Award-winning: Aldi's Highland Earl Black Label Scotch Whisky will be flying off the shelves

Budget supermarket Aldi, the go-to shop for the recession-hit middle classes, has won a prestigious gold medal award for its own brand scotch.

Experts at the International Wine and Spirits competition awarded the chain the top award for its Highland Black 8 Year Old Scotch Whisky, which costs £13.19.

The accolade is the latest in a long line of awards given to the chain's world-class alcohol range.

A bottle of Aldi's Monsigny champagne, which costs just £12.99, beat some of the world's most renowned champagnes in a blind taste test in May.

Its £10 gin was praised in April for its 'clear, crisp, complex flavour' which beat well-known brands up to ten times the price.

Judges of the supermarket's whiskey said it has a, 'super balance, and super smooth flow leading into long, fruit filled finish.'

The Highland Black is made from a blend of grain and 
malt whiskies and previously secured top prizes at the Scotch Whisky 
Masters and International Spirits Challenge earlier this year.

Tony Baines, MD Buying at Aldi, said:
'It’s a massive achievement to win just one gold medal for our 
own-label whisky, but three is just fantastic.

'We’ve always been very proud of it, but it’s great to see the world’s leading drinks experts agree with us.

'It just goes to show that buying world-class drinks doesn’t have to cost the earth.'

Aldi has benefited from the economic downturn as hard-up shoppers defected to
the cheaper supermarket chain for affordable, high quality goods.

The
store beat the 'big four' chains- Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda and 
Morrissons- to be named Britain's best supermarket by Which? last month.

Which? said it was named the winner for its range of best buys, quality food and good pricing.

The
consumer champion said: 'Its low prices don't seem to compromise on 
quality. Within Aldi's keenly priced range it has produced a number of 
best buys.

Middle class haven: The budget supermarket has become popular with shoppers who would traditionally buy their groceries from Waitrose

What to buy: The Grocer magazine named Aldi Grocer Of The Year and gave 16 products a coveted gold medal

Proud: Managing director of Aldi Tony Baines said the award validated their sought-after product. He said: 'We've always been very proud of it, but it's great to see the world¿s leading drinks experts agree with us'

'We've seen 
everyday items, such as Magnum Eucalyptus Antibacterial washing-up 
liquid and Almat with Stain-Lift Bio Powder, do better than costly 
rivals.'

Aldi has made huge efforts to attract Middle Britain shoppers by introducing a range of superior products at budget prices from fine wines and spirits, to coffee, olive oil and Aberdeen Angus steaks.

The group slims down its overheads and profit margins to the minimum with minimalist stores, fewer staff and charges for plastic bags.

It does not stock any of the big brands, like Kellogg’s and Heinz, however it has run into trouble for creating its own cheaper copycat versions.
