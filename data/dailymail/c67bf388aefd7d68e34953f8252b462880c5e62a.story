The ask.fm page of a 13-year-old, believed to be  Islamic State terrorist Khaled Sharrouf's daughter, paints a picture of a teen stuck in a war zone, who loves actress Sandra Bullock and the colour pink

A social media page belonging to the teenager daughter of the notorious Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf has given a rare glimpse into their life in Syria with ISIS.

The ask.fm page of a 13-year-old girl, who is understood to be Sharrouf's daughter, paints a picture of a family-orientated and religious teenager who loves the actress Sandra Bullock and the colour pink,The Australian reports.

Khaled Sharrouf is the known member of terrorist group Islamic State who infamously shared a photograph of his son holding up a decapitated head. He fled Australia for Syria using his brother's passport in December.

His Muslim convert wife, Tara Nettleton, and their five children – three boys and two girls – followed Sharrouf by travelling through Malaysia at the beginning of the year.

Ten months ago, a 13-year-old who is believed to be Sharrouf's eldest daughter, wrote on her ask.fm profile: 'The best holiday I have eva [sic] had was the one when I travelled to Malaysia for three weeks', before adding in another post, that the 'most fun place' she had ever been to was 'Desa water park in Malaysia'.

Another chilling post, that is believed to have been written before the teenager's move to the Middle East, sees the 13-year-old answer the question: 'How would you describe your country in three words?' with: 'beautiful, safe and wonderful'. 

The theme of safety was repeated when she was asked what the 'most important thing her country had given to the world' was, answering: 'a safe place to live in and no worries'.

While images of Sharrouf's sons holding firearms have been brandished on social media in the past, little has been heard of his two daughters

A Twitter page linked to the 13-year-old's ask.fm account posted an image of five men holding weapons and the Islamic State flag on May 3.

While images of Sharrouf's sons holding firearms have been brandished on social media in the past, little has been heard of his daughters - the youngest of which loves spending time with her cousins and playing basketball, The Australian reports.

According to The Australian, a few months after Sharrouf's children are believed to have arrived in Syria, his daughters spent a lot of time posting pictures and messages on social media.

His eldest daughter was reported to have 'liked' an image of a dead fighter that had been shared by Sharrouf, as well as a photo of the World Trade Centre on fire that he had captioned 'September 11 is the best day of my life'.

On her own social media post about needing love, the Islamic State fighter himself is reported to have commented 'Sorry.. I'm just a terrorist. I can't love anybody', The Australian reports.

Other posts on the 13-year-old's ask.fm profile attest to her love for her family.

'My family makes me happy and hanging out with friends makes me happy,' she wrote in a post.
