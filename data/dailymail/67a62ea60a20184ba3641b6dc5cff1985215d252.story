At least half the audience may have been paying very close attention to the hunky leading man. But some viewers of Poldark will have appreciated the delightfully rustic charms of the backdrop to this story of love, jealousy and passion.

In the BBC drama, the bustling town of Truro is a lost world of 18th-century wooden shop fronts, muddy thoroughfares and pens of geese and sheep.

Which goes to prove how cleverly the producers disguised the fact that it is actually a real-life English market town a long horse ride from the series’ rugged Cornish setting.

The Red Lion street market that's really a parking bay: The fictional pub The Red Lion, and its large wooden sign, was added to the street. Pens for animals, as well as a vegetable stall and a Punch and Judy show, were added to create a typical scene from the period

Demelza's dirt road that's really got yellow lines: The street where Poldark and his future wife Demelza walked is a real row of terrace houses in Corsham. The producers hid the modern double yellow lines under a fake dirt-covered road that looked as though it was from another era

Saddlery that's really a curry house: With its panelled frontage and rows of saddles, Truscott and Son is entirely convincing as an 18th-century saddlery. But the elaborate facade was required to hide a much more modern stalwart of the High Street - the Indian restaurant. Haque's Indian Cuisine had its signature green shop front hidden behind a carefully crafted set, complete with barrel and harness stands

When Captain Ross Poldark rescued his future wife, Demelza, from a gang of thugs in the first episode of the eight-part series, he was not in Cornwall at all, but more than 150 miles away in Corsham, Wiltshire.

Though its stone buildings look believable on screen, these photographs reveal how the town usually looks — complete with Indian restaurant and baby clothes shop.

The film crew arrived in town over the May Bank Holiday weekend, and the familiar shop fronts and neat parking spaces began to be replaced by dirt-covered roads, rickety carts and wandering horses.

Tell-tale signs of the modern age, such as phone boxes and road signs, were cleverly hidden inside wooden shacks, or temporarily removed. The changes took just one weekend to complete, and took many residents by surprise.

One told BBC News at the time: ‘It’s exciting, I didn’t know it was happening. I’ve just come down to the jeweller’s and found it all changed.’

Rope store that's really a flower shop: Theodora's flower show may have been in Corsham for 25 years but there was no space for it in Poldark's Truro. Tor turn it into a store for fishing equipment, the TV crew covered over the modern florist's shop with a weathered wooden casing and accessorised it with benches, baskets, fishing tackle and coils of rope. You can almost smell the sea...

Wheelwright's that's really a baby boutique: Vickery the wheelwright's is actually a children's clothes shop, so the colourful shop front had to be boarded over and the nearby modern metal gate hidden behind panelling. The road was covered and the pavement intentionally scuffed to turn back the centuries. A panoply of wheelwright's instruments were placed in front of the 18th-century store

Shed that's a phone box: A phone box was cleverly hidden in a wooden shed and a hay cart added to complete the rustic look

Filming took just a week and people were allowed to use the High Street between scenes, as many businesses stayed open.

A council spokesman said any shops which saw trading hit by the temporary intrusion were compensated by the production company.

‘Most people loved it, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Over the course of a week, more and more people came to watch.’

With more than six million viewers tuning in to each of the first three episodes of the series, Poldark’s brooding leading man Aidan Turner has garnered a legion of breathless fans.

That success means it may not be long before tourists are beating a path to Corsham, which has already played host to other high-profile productions, including War Horse and The Suspicions Of Mr Whicher.

Its latest transformation was so impressive that a special photography exhibition has been arranged by the council showcasing the High Street before and during filming.

It’s on display in the town hall and closes on Friday — two days before the next bodice-ripping instalment of Poldark.
