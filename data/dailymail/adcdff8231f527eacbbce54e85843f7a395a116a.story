A gay couple looking to adopt a baby have made a parody of Meghan Trainor's hit song Dear Future Husband, in the hopes it will find them a child.

Titling their own rendition of the song Dear Future Baby, Joe Morales and Joey Famoso from Minneapolis, Minnesota, re-wrote Ms Trainor's lyrics  to outline what great parents they will be, and are hopeful a potential birth mother will see the video and reach out to them.

'We are currently on our adoption journey and decided to try something a little different by writing our future baby this love song!,' the duo explain in the stylized music video.

'We have always dreamed of becoming fathers and hopefully this video will help make that dream come true by connecting us to our future birth mother.'

Ms Trainor's original song Dear Future Husband sees the singer test the husband potential of various suitors, while singing about what she expects in return. 

In the parody, the couple, who have spent the last 12 months trying to adopt, sing to their future baby: 'You're gonna be our one and only all our life Dear future baby Make time for you Won't leave you lonely And know you'll always be our baby for all time.

'If you need us we'll be right there in a flash Well be putting all your artwork on the fridge We'll Help you get good grades And go to all your games We promise you We promise you baby.'  

Mr Morales and Mr Famoso, who have been together for five years, told MailOnline that last October, they received the 'call of a lifetime' from their adoption agency.

'A birthmother had selected us! She was due in three weeks… We were finally going to be fathers!' 

But after the baby was born, two days before Thanksgiving, the social worker told them that the mother had chnaged her mind: she had decided to keep the baby.

'Words cannot even begin to describe the shock, heartache, and sheer disbelief we felt… for weeks,' they recalled. 

'Looking back, we were lucky… we could have had her longer, fallen deeper in love, promised her more; but regardless of whether you have a child for ten minutes or for the rest of your life, you have been changed with their presence. 

'It was a rough Thanksgiving… and an even harder Christmas… but by the time January was upon us, we were ready to start again. Although the situation was devastating and extremely unfortunate, it reaffirmed our strong desire and commitment to becoming fathers.'

With a renewed spirit and the sweet melody of Ms Trainor's song, they were inspired to create a parody/

'Our goal is to have our video shared with as many people as possible in hopes of being connected with our future birthmother.'
