The FIA has decided not to penalise Caterham and Marussia for their absence from this weekend's United States Grand Prix.

The demise of the two teams over the past week forced the stewards present at the Circuit of the Americas to review the circumstances behind their withdrawal.

With both marques in breach of the sporting regulations which state they are to 'participate in every event with the number of cars and drivers entered', the FIA naturally had to look into the matter.

Via a statement, the FIA has commented that 'in view of the current financial circumstances, the stewards decide not to impose any penalty'.

In addition, the statement added: 'Because of the particular nature of the breach, the matter is referred to the attention of the FIA president (Jean Todt).'

With the two teams given dispensation by F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone to miss this race and the next one in Brazil, the stewards overseeing the race at Interlagos will be faced with the same situation.

For the first time since the 2005 Monaco Grand Prix, the race at COTA has its lowest number of entries on the grid.

With only 18 cars present, the stewards have also decided to tweak the qualifying format.

Instead of six cars exiting at the end of each of the first two sessions, it will now be four, ensuring the top-10 shoot-out remains.

The FIA, meanwhile, has again questioned the financial 'failings' of Formula One in light of Marussia and Caterham being forced to enter into administration.

Earlier this season Todt's plans to introduce a budget cap for 2015 was torpedoed by the major marques.

Despite an indication the teams were willing to finally accept a cost cap - after a 2009 proposal under former FIA president Max Mosley was also rejected - it was ultimately thrown out to Todt's fury.

Now, in the words of Mosley earlier this week 'the chickens have come to roost', with the financial unsustainability of running a Formula One team leading to Caterham and Marussia's woes.

Offering a clear indication the situation has to change, the FIA has vowed to pursue a situation where the gap between the haves and have nots closes.

A statement from the FIA read: 'Looking beyond the end of the 2014 season, these failings again acutely raise the question of the economic balance of the FIA Formula One Championship and justify the position, expressed many times by the FIA, in favour of any initiative that will help reduce costs in order to ensure the survival of the existing grid or attract potential new entrants.

'As such, the FIA, in close co-operation with FOM (Bernie Ecclestone's Formula One Management) and the different stakeholders in F1, will continue to work towards maintaining the attraction of the championship and the equitable participation of the teams in it in the years to come.'

Many will view the FIA's response as simply hot air as it has so far failed to turn meaningful actions in the past into reality.
