Rights campaigner Peter Tatchell warned LGBT Youth North West's plans for a school for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender children was not a good idea

Gay rights campaigners have criticised plans for Britain’s first school for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender children.

A taxpayer-funded youth group wants to set up a school for pupils 13 and older who are being bullied because of their sexuality.

LGBT Youth North West denied that the school would be a ‘ghetto’ for gay youngsters and said mainstream schools can be ‘one of the last bastions of homophobia’. 

But critics said the move would amount to segregation and would ‘foster division’.

Rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: ‘For some vulnerable young gay kids who have been badly bullied because of their sexuality, it might be good to temporarily take them out of the mainstream school system so they can study in a safe secure environment.

'But in the long term separate schooling is not a good idea. The real way to deal with homophobic bullying is not to take kids out of schools, but to stop the bullying and educate pupils on gay understanding and acceptance.’

Ruth Hunt, of gay rights group Stonewall, said LGBT-only schools were not the answer, adding: ‘Our experience working with more than 12,000 schools … shows that it is possible to create safe and inclusive environments where all pupils can be themselves.

‘This makes the learning environment better for all students – regardless of their sexual orientation – and is key to eradicating homophobia in every single school in Britain.’

Tory MP Graham Stuart, chairman of the Commons Education Select Committee, said care was needed to ensure the free school movement does not lead to ‘segregation’.

He said his concerns about the plans were: ‘First, what this says about the treatment of gay children in some mainstream schools, and why this isn’t being more effectively addressed, and second … LGBT schools may reduce rather than reinforce the need for all schools to be inclusive of every type of pupil.’

Ukip’s education spokesman, Paul Nuttall, said: ‘This idea does nothing but foster division … it is utterly bizarre to be taking a step that highlights differences.’

LGBT Youth North West’s Amelia Lee said her organisation has carried out a survey of gay, lesbian and transgender young people which found many felt teachers had been unsupportive and in some cases simply urged them to ‘ignore’ bullying. She said mainstream schools struggle to tackle bullying of gay pupils, adding: ‘Schools can be one of the last bastions of homophobia.’

The youth group's  plans for Britain's first all-LGBT school (posed by model left) has also been criticised by Tory MP Graham Stuart, chairman of the Commons Education Select Committee, who said care was needed to ensure the free school movement does not lead to ‘segregation’

The group is using a grant for £63,000 from the Department for Communities and Local Government to pay for a feasibility study into setting up the school at the Joyce Layland LGBT Centre in central Manchester.

But a source close to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: ‘There is simply no way that we will approve a free school specifically for LGBT young people.’ 

The source added that all pupils should be in mainstream schools ‘which should be equipped to tackle any bullying’.

Miss Lee said the proposed school would also be open to heterosexual pupils and to those questioning their sexuality.
