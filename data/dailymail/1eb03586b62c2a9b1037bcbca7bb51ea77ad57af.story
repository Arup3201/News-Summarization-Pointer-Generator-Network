While thousands are expected to flock to Australia Zoo on July 24 to celebrate Bindi Irwin's 16th birthday, there will be one face missing from the crowd.

Bindi's grandfather Bob Irwin has opted not to join in the festivities, but instead the patriarch will be in Queensland’s far north working on a crocodile conservation project.

The Irwins have invited guests and the public to join in on Bindi's big day and celebrate in style with contortionist acts, rock climbing, African drumming and hula hooping workshops.

And in a fitting move for Steve Irwin's daughter's party, guests have been asked to attend in an animal onesie.

But more than 2,500km away, Bob Irwin will be enjoying a quieter day in Cape York – six years after rumours of a family rift erupted between the late croc hunter’s father and wife, Ninemsn reported.

An Australian Zoo spokeswoman was unable to confirm if Mr Irwin had received an invitation directly from his family to attend.

‘I’m not sure why Bob is not attending,’ she told Ninemsn.

Revelations that there was trouble brewing in the Irwin clan came to light when the late Steve Irwin's father revealed he was saddened he had not received a visit from his granddaughter after suffering a heart attack in 2008.

Mr Irwin resigned from his position at Australia Zoo to 'carry on Steve's work' solo after a rift with his son's widow, Terri Irwin.

But since the incident Mr Irwin did not say whether or not he had received a visit from either of his grandchildren in the past four years, but did say he kept in 'regular' contact with family members.

'I think Terri's done a great job with those children, she's had to raise them herself,' he said.

'They are well-adjusted children – they have a good background with their dad. Nobody could be more down to earth than Steve was.

'They’ve got a great future ahead of them.'

After leaving Australia Zoo in Queensland’s Beerwah, Bob Irwin continues to his links with environmental conservation and is working on a plan that would allow landowners to put parts of estates up for conservation.

But Mr Irwin still keeps a close eye on his grandchildren's high profile conservation efforts.

'I’m really excited about the projects they are involved in,' he said.

After celebrating her 16th birthday, Bindi told Ninemsn she planned to turn her head to 'tackling the bigger issues facing our world today'.  

Mr Irwin's absence from celebrations comes eight years after he opened up about his rift with his late son's widow, Terri Irwin (left) pictured here with her son, Robert (centre), and Bindi at her 11th birthday

'The non-consumptive use of wildlife and over human population tend to be topics that are not openly discussed and until we start talking about these issues, we can't create positive change,' she said.

'I am currently studying a Certificate III in Business and Tourism with Sunshine Coast Tafe, I hope to be able to use this to work alongside my mum and help manage Australia Zoo.

'I also hope to continue my film work in order to spread my message of conservation, I am looking forward to seeing what the future holds for me.'

There will be more than enough Bindi to go around on July 24 with the birthday girl planning to make appearances on the day.

From 12pm she will feed crocodiles live with Terri and her brother, Robert, and grab a free piece of Bindi's birthday cake as well at 3pm.

After the celebrations, the 16-year-old plans to have a quiet one with her immediate family, chowing down on some Chinese food.

Bindi's father, Steve Irwin, died after he was pierced through the chest by a stingray barb in 2006 in Queensland's Batt Reef.
