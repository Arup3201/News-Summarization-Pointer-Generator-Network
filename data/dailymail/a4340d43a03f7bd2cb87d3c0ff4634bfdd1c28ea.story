The only child in the world known to suffer from two extremely rare types of blood cancer has died following a year-long battle against the diseases.

Lauryn Robinson died at her home in Mold, North Wales, surrounded by her family, on Sunday.

A year ago the eight-year-old was diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukaemia and Burkitts non-Hodgkins lymphoma - the only child in the world with the forms of leukaemia.

Today her parents Emma and Andrew Robinson have paid tribute to their ‘amazing’ daughter.

 North Wales, on June 29, after a fight against 
lymphoblastic leukaemia and Burkitts non-Hodgkins lymphoma. She is pictured left during her treatment and right, before she was diagnosed with the two rare forms of blood cancer

Her mother said: 'Lauryn was our whole world, she was our best friend.

‘She
 was so considerate, thoughtful of others, funny and just an amazing 
person. She never followed the crowd; she loved what she loved.’

Lauryn’s
 battle began in July last year when she was diagnosed with both acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia and Burkitts non-Hodgkins lymphoma.

She
 spent 19 weeks undergoing treatment at the Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool 
before her parents were told her diseases were remission.

In October last year the youngster was allowed to return home.

But
 two months later, doctors discovered the cancer had returned spreading to form a brain tumour and invading her bone marrow.

Lauryn's fight inspired hundreds of donations to various cancer charities and in her last months the eight-year-old met some of her idols, including pop groups the Backstreet Boys and A1.

She was a 
huge Formula One fan and had been due to meet driver Max Chilton at 
Silverstone race circuit in Northamptonshire this week ahead of the 
British Grand Prix on Sunday.

Her father said: ‘Nurses said to us, within 10 minutes, you just fell in love with Lauryn.

‘A
 man at the Backstreet Boys gig we went to felt the same and after talking 
to her, he gave up his VIP passes to her and bought her gifts too. 
People just fell in love with her.’

Just two months later doctors discovered the 
cancer had returned in the form of a brain tumour and was also present 
in Lauryn's bone marrow She is pictured left at the age of seven and right, with her school friends

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is an agressive cancer of the white blood cells.

The cells, which usually work together to fight infection and repair and reproduce themselves, divide uncontrollably in the bone marrow but do not mature.

This stops the bone marrow from making healthy blood cells and leads to an increased risk of infection.

Sufferers can become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells.

They can develop bruises and bleeding and feel aches and pains in the limbs.

Burkitts non-Hodgkins lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is part of the body's immune system, made up of organs such as the bone marrow and lymph nodes.

Lymph nodes are connected by a network of tiny tubes and they collect and filter out unwanted bacteria, viruses, damaged cells and cancer cells.

Fluid in the nodes contains lymphocytes - white blood cells that help the body fight disease - and grow in the bone marrow, where blood cells are made.

Lymphoma is a disease where lymphocyte B-cells grow in an uncontrolled way. Patients with the cancer experience a swelling in the lymph nodes.

If Burkitts lymphoma is in the chest or throat, people can have difficulty swallowing or breathing, whereas if it appears as a lump in the abdomen, it can cause pain, swelling, nausea and diarrhoea.

Mrs Robinson said: ‘We just had six months of wonderful time together. She’d met A1 twice, met the Backstreet Boys twice.

‘We just had fun with her.

'Lauryn never asked why and the consultants were amazed at just how far she’d come.

‘She was very happy, making us laugh every day and we looked to her for strength.’

Dilwyn Jones, headteacher at Bryn Gwalia, where Lauryn was a pupil, said: ‘There is a darkness that has descended over the Bryn Gwalia community with the sad loss of Lauryn, one of our pupils.

'Our deepest respect and sympathy is with Lauryn’s family and friends at the loss of such a precious child.

‘The children, and indeed the whole school community have struggled to comprehend why someone so young and so special should have to die.

‘Lauryn was filled with life and enjoyed everything entertaining, especially singing and dancing.

'Her favourites were Steps and Backstreet Boys and not forgetting Formula One racing.

‘She was the kindest of children who shared a special bond with a close group of friends.

'They have completed a memory box in school to capture memories and feelings and have written: “We miss you so much, we will never forget you. You will never be replaced, you are the bravest girl in the world.”

‘There is a glimmer of light in the gloom of grief that helps us to remember Lauryn as the brave girl who endured so much in her short life, to remember how we should live in whatever time we have left, with humour, friendship and resilience.

‘This is Lauryn’s legacy and it will live on in those fortunate enough to have known her.’
