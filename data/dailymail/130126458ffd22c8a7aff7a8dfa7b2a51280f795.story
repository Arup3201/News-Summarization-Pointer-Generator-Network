Conman: Michael Hirst, who has been sentenced to three years for theft after scamming vulnerable pensioners out of £130,000

A financier fleeced vulnerable pensioners in swindles which netted him £130,000.

Michael Hirst, 53, of Mayals, Swansea, was described as 'jaw-droppingly callous' as he was jailed for three years at Cardiff Crown Court after admitting 13 counts of theft.

He stole life savings, nest eggs and even a widow's pension pay-out in a five-year con from August 2007.

Hirst even spoke at the funeral of the husband of one of his victim's, while pocketing cash the widow gave him for her own future funeral.

The conman, now divorced, moved to Wales in January 2006 and began working for HHPG financial services which has offices across South Wales, the court heard.

He left the business in December 2010 after he was convicted of assaulting his wife. His double life then began to unravel as the company found investors coming forward it had no knowledge of.

Pensioner Teresa Davies, 73, gave Hirst more than £69,000 for investment, including £40,000 from the sale of her daughter's home after her death, money earmarked for the education of the daughter she left behind.

John Evans, 74, of Ystrad, Rhondda Valley, handed over £40,000 life savings for investment and was given documents Hirst made on his laptop.

Retired Swansea nurse Priscilla Thomas, 66, saw Hirst as a trusted friend and gave over her pension lump sum of £17,000 for investment.

She gave him £4,900 for her own future funeral, which he pocketed. She also trusted him enough to give him 11 signed blank cheques so he could take advantage of investment opportunities for her.

'I feel that he has taken my trust, screwed it up into a ball and thrown it back in my face,' Mrs Thomas told the court.

Lee Reynolds, defending, said Hirst was 'genuinely remorseful,' adding he also suffered from very serious health problems.

Judge Thomas Crowther, passing sentence, said: 'This was a pitiless course of offending without a shred of empathy at all.

'The fact that you spoke at Priscilla Thomas' husband's funeral would be seen by most as jaw-droppingly callous.

'You did all this simply to make yourself feel good. Whether you remorse is genuine is questionable given the length of time of your offending.'
