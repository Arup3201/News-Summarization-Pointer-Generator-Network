This is the terrifying moment a UN peacekeeper is gunned down in front of his shocked comrades moments after arriving at the scene of looting in the troubled Central African Republic.

The dramatic incident was witnessed first hand by a British Journalist who was driving through the capital Bangui when the truck carrying the peacekeepers swerved in front of his vehicle and pulled up just a few metres away.

As soon as the soldiers jump down off the back of the truck the sound of gunfire can be heard and almost instantly one of the men falls in a heap on the ground.

moments after arriving at the scene of looting in the troubled Central 
African Republic

Some of his comrades take cover while others can be seen cocking their rifles and returning fire.

A voice can be heard saying 'they shot their own man’, however it is unclear from the video whether or not the soldier was hit by friendly fire.

Witness: British Journalist Alex Thomson, Chief Correspondent for Channel 4, watched the drama unfold

Alex Thomson, Chief Correspondent for Channel 4 News, wrote in his blog: 'As our cameraman Stuart Webb filmed we witnessed them jump out and open fire.

'There is a large volley of shots before anyone appeared to take up firing positions or cover.

'Almost at once one of the soldiers falls, apparently shot, a few metres forward of our position. He lies motionless on the road. Their target appeared to be civilians who had run up a side street from the main airport road.

'I detected no incoming fire and in the chaotic way they opened up it is at least possible he either shot himself or was shot by one of his own men.'

The incident happened shortly after it was announced that two French soldiers had been killed fighting in Bangui underscoring the challenges of the French military intervention in the nearly lawless former colony.

The government of the predominantly Christian country, was overthrown in March by Muslim rebels from the country's north.

While the rebels claimed no religious motive for seizing power, months of resentment and hostility erupted last week in a wave of violence that left more than 400 people dead.

France now has some 1,600 troops on the ground in Central African Republic, patrolling neighborhoods and trying to disarm militants from the Seleka rebel movement that forced the president into exile and installed their own leader Michel Djotodia as head of state.

The two French troops were part of a team inspecting a neighborhood 1,200 meters east of Bangui's airport close to midnight Monday, in preparation for a disarmament operation, French military spokesman Col. Gilles Jaron said in Paris.

Casualty: Moments after stepping into the street one of the soldiers is shot and falls to the ground

Wounded: As the sound of gunfire subsides, the soldiers move back into the middle of the street to help their fallen comrade

Five to 10 gunmen opened fire on the French patrol, which returned fire, he said. Two Frenchmen were wounded and taken to the hospital where they died. It was unclear whether anyone else died in the clash.

Jaron described 'sporadic fire' around Bangui and occasional clashes since the French disarmament efforts got under way Monday.

Two deaths within days of the operation beginning marks a significant toll compared to France's mission in Mali earlier this year.

A total of seven French soldiers have been killed there since January as France and its allies have ousted al-Qaida-linked extremists from power in northern cities.

French officials have warned of the dangers of the enhanced military mission alongside African Union troops in Central African Republic, authorized under a muscular mandate approved last week by the United Nations Security Council.

France's defense minister has warned militia groups to disarm peacefully - or French troops will do it by force.

French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said French forces were conducting patrols by foot and vehicle through the dusty streets of Bangui. At one point, they intervened to pull away a Muslim man, who claimed to be a merchant, from a mob that accused him of being a rebel leader.

The early casualties underscore the volatility of the mission to disarm combatants and bring stability to a largely anarchic capital.

A mob on Monday stoned to death a suspected enemy in the street, and armed fighters have abducted and killed hospital patients.

Tensions flared again Tuesday as a mob of young men set fire to a mosque in the Fou neighborhood of the capital, Bangui. Smoke billowed from smoldering vehicles nearby, and young men used pick axes and whatever tools they could find to try to tear down the walls of the mosque.

Despite the ongoing violence French President Francois Hollande he will travel to the former French colony on Tuesday, after attending a memorial in South Africa to Nelson Mandela.
