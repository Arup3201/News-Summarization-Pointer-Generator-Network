Free banking in Britain will be 'dead within a decade' and customers instead asked to pay American-style charges of around £10 per month, experts said today.

Those who refuse to pay for using their current account would face restrictions on withdrawals and using branches, a leading firm of consultants has claimed.

PriceWaterHouseCooper's report says offering free accounts is becoming 'unsustainable' and increases the risk of future mis-selling scandals. 

Steve Davies, the retail banking leader at PwC, also said that paying for current accounts as standard could smash the control the big banks have on the UK market.

Many experts say free banking is a 'dangerous myth' bankrolled by overdraft fees and rock-bottom interest rates.

End of an era: The practice of offering free bank accounts in Britain could come to an end within ten years, according to a report

Most major banks in Britain such as Lloyds and Barclays offer free banking alongside paid-for accounts providing perks such as travel and mobile phone insurance.

But the policy remains controversial and some politicians, regulators and bankers have called for it to end, so banks do not attempt to squeeze profits from customers elsewhere. 

They say ending it would make charges more transparent and improve competition and levels of service.

Steve Davies, retail banking leader at PwC, said current accounts were not as free as they seemed.

'UK current accounts are not free at all and are paid for through overdraft charges, penalty fees and uncompetitive or zero rates of interest,' he said.

'The free banking model stifles innovation and competition,' Mr Davies added.

Millions of customers are paying £400 or more a year in unnecessary overdraft fees because Britain's biggest banks make it too hard  to compare charges, it emerged recently.

Alex Chisholm, pictured, head of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), said in November that customers 'cannot be bothered' to move banks because it is too difficult to work out if they will be better off.

The CMA has  launched a major investigation to challenge the stranglehold of Britain's big four banks on the finances of families and small businesses.

The CMA is concerned that customers are being misled by the finance giants, which promote their services as ‘free banking’. 

Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC are accused of controlling 77 per cent of the nation’s 65million personal accounts but offering poor service and rip-off deals.

The Competition & Markets Authority says not enough customers are shifting to lenders with high levels of service, reducing choice in the market. 

According to the Daily Telegraph, he claimed free accounts could disappear 'most likely within a decade'. 

'It requires new challenger banks to achieve scale very quickly if they are to survive and it fails to reward banks that come up with new ideas as costs cannot be recovered,' he said.

Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC are accused of controlling 77 per cent of the nation’s 65million personal accounts but offering poor service and rip-off deals. 

The report, based on a survey of over 2,000 people, showed a majority were aware accounts appearing free can carry hidden charges. 

However, one in two said they would be likely to change banks if an upfront fee was introduced instead.

Nearly two-thirds said they were not prepared to pay anything up front and 27 percent said they would not pay more than £10 a month.

The issue is already being looked at by Britain's competition watchdog, which is considering whether banks should charge customers for holding their personal current accounts as part of a wider inquiry into the industry.

Andrew Bailey, head of the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, has called free banking a 'dangerous myth', while some senior bankers also want it to end.

However, the boss of Lloyds, Britain's biggest retail bank, said in November free banking should remain and authorities should not impose charges as part of attempts to shake up the market.

Many banks in the US, Canada, parts of Europe and Australia charge monthly fees for their services.

Banks in France charge a management fee of €10 (£7.80) for every three months – €40 a year.

On top of that, there is typically an annual fee of around €40 for a debit card, or €45 for a credit card that can be used overseas. French banks also charge €1 a month for five text messages giving balance details.

A bank might charge €60 to allow a customer to have a long-term authorised overdraft, although the interest rates are capped at relatively low levels.

In the US, the Bank of America has a standard fee of $12 (£7.50) a month – $144 a year – for those who do not have a minimum balance of $1,500.

There is also a fee of $2.50 for cash withdrawals from machines not owned by the bank.

On top of that, overdraft charges can be extremely high, with a fee of up to $35 for every payment that is bounced.
