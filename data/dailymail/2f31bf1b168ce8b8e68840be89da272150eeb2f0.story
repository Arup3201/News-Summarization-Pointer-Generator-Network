Hundreds of whale watchers gathered at Sydney's northern beaches to catch a glimpse of a southern right whale who is thought to be pregnant.

Just 50 metres off the shore of Warriewood Beach, the 16-metre mammal treated spectators to a rare, upclose look as it swam up and down the southern end of the coastline as well as lifting its barnacle-covered head to taste the sea breeze.

But hopes of a marine birth off Sydney's shoreline might be premature - experts have not confirmed the southern right is a female and won't know until a calf is spotted.

The Southern Right whale was spotted just off Warriewood Beach on Thursday at 7am

Experts believe the whale is pregnant but cannot confirm this until it gives birth, which could be Friday

However the mammal's behaviour has got watchers excited as he or she displays typical actions of an expectant mother.

'She's vocalising a lot, we can hear her trumpeting sound from the shore. There's also a lot of tail-lifting,' said Ronny Ling, President of the Marine Mammal Rescue and Research organisation.

Organisation for the Rescue and Research of Cetaceans in Australia's (ORRCA) Shona Lorigan added: 'If she is to go into labour, I expect it to happen overnight and in more sheltered waters.'

'It is the season for whales to be birthing, and we had a similar situation on Monday with a mother and calf discovered off the Central Coast.'

But people were warned to stay away for their own safety after some morning surfers got a bit too close.

It is advised people should stay at least 100 metres from the whale, and if she does have a calf then at least 300 metres is best.

The 16-metre mammal attracted hundreds of locals and whale watchers throughout the day

'It's exciting, it's beautiful but they can be unpredictable,' NSW National Parks' Natasha Funke told Nine News.

'They are wild animals, they're very big and we don't want anyone getting hurt.'

The whale was spotted at 7am on Thursday and excited spectators throughout the day with its frequent calls and frisky tail activity.

Whales usually birth in calm bays, and southern right whales in particular are known for coming in close to the shoreline.

There are only about 5,000 southern rights left in the southern hemisphere.
