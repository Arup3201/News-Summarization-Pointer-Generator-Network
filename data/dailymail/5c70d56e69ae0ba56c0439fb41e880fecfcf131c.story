The family of a mentally-ill man shot dead by Texas police are demanding a federal investigation into the death after releasing home security video footage showing their son's final moments.

Deputies were called to the Houston home last November after Michael Blair, 26, a paranoid schizophrenic, locked himself in the bathroom and threatened to commit suicide.

An altercation followed between two officers and Blair, before he was shot eleven times.

The family of Michael Blair, a mentally-ill man shot dead by Texas police, are demanding a federal investigation into the death after releasing home security video footage showing their son's final moments

Michael Blair's family have now released disturbing home security video footage of the moments leading up to his him being shot eleven times

The officers were later cleared of any wrongdoing by an internal investigation and a grand jury, but Blair’s family have now released disturbing home security video footage of the shocking incident, reports ABC7.

The footage shows the two officers trying to coax Blair out of the bathroom, but when they manage to open the door, they see that he has a knife.

‘He’s got a knife! He’s got a knife!’ one cop yells. ‘Stay down! Stay down!’

Blair then shuts the door, but the officers kick it back open.

'I do not want to shoot you,' one deputy tells him. 'I do not want to shoot you.'

The officers ordered Blair to drop the knife an estimated 50 times and then one of the officers fired a Taser at him.

'Keep Tasing, keep Tasing,' one deputy tells his partner. 'Drop the knife! Drop the knife!'

Then suddenly the man stands up and appears to lunge towards the officers. The deputy holding a firearm then shots Blair 11 times in quick succession.

In the background Blair's mom can be heard crying: 'You killed him!'

Blair's family, who hadn't previously shared the tape with investigators, released the footage on Monday and said that they intended to hand a copy over to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

They insist that the officers didn't have to shoot the mentally-ill man and are demanding a federal civil rights investigation.

'All that we're asking is that someone recognize what we recognize. That was brutality,' said Blair's mother, Kimberly Blair Olaniyi.

'These cases are always lied. And truths are not told. And so that tape was held until they would finish their "investigation,"' said Quanell X, a community activist who is helping the family.
