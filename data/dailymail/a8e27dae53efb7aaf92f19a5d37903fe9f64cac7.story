Drunk: Party girl Hannah Sneade, 20 sparked a huge emergency by claiming she was caught up in a car crash with 10 other people to get off a drink driving charge

A drunken trainee teacher who crashed her car sparked a huge emergency by pretending she was in an accident involving 10 people.

Hannah Sneade, 20, tried to avoid a drink driving charge by telling a 999 operator that she was in a taxi with 10 friends which had crashed on a country road.

This resulted in four ambulances, three police cars and two fire engines racing to the scene. An air ambulance was put on stand-by and hospitals were warned to expect a flood of casualties.

But when emergency services arrived at the remote spot all they found was bleary-eyed Sneade shivering in her pink pyjamas.

Police noticed she smelled strongly of alcohol and a breath test showed she was more than twice the legal limit for driving.

Sneade confessed she made up the story about the crash in the taxi to avoid being prosecuted for drink driving.

Police found her damaged Peugeot car nearby and an investigation revealed no other vehicle was involved.

Magistrates at Welshpool, Mid Wales, heard Sneade's wild claim caused 'significant strain' for the emergency services.

Paul Inns, defending, said: 'Miss Sneade has not covered herself in glory with this matter.

'She had been out celebrating a friend's birthday and had been dropped off at home.

'For some inexplicable reason she decided to get into her vehicle and drive to see her boyfriend.'

On her Twitter page Sneade describes herself as 'Welsh farmers daughter studying to be a teacher at Chester University! Work hard - play hard!'

The night before her arrest she tweeted: 'Just about to let rip on the sauce yet again... Dressed as a sheep!! £pubcrawl £baaaaaa'

Her next tweet, made after being released from police custody, said: 'Thank you all for your calls, messages and visits! Means a lot. Xxxx'

Farmer's daughter Sneade, of Sarn, Newtown, admitted drink driving and was bannedfor 22 months.

Sneade was fined £75 and ordered to pay £85 costs with a £15 victim surcharge.

She will have her driving ban reduced by four months if she completes a drink-drive rehabilitation course.
