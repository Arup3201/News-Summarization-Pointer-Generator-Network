Just weeks after surviving a potential leadership spill, it appears Prime Minister Tony Abbott might have to prepare himself for round two.

Backbenchers have reportedly informed Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull that he's got the numbers for a successful spill motion to take the top job, according to Seven News.

But they've said the move would have to be initiated by senior Liberal ministers.

It is believed Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop is against another spill motion but will stand against Mr Turnbull if it goes ahead.

Others tried to downplay the claims by saying a second attempt at a leadership spill would be 'madness', the Daily Telegraph reports.

This comes as Mr Abbott publicly flayed Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs after the commission released a report examining the conditions of children held in detention.

Mr Turnbull then refused to echo the Prime Minister's attacks on Prof Triggs, heaping praise on her instead.

An increasing number of MPs told Mr Turnbull on Thursday he has the figures to beat Mr Abbott in a leadership challenge but the move would have to come from the Cabinet.

'We've done our bit ... it's now the Cabinet's turn,' one MP told Seven News.

'The temperature has increased this week,' another said.

Supporters of Ms Bishop also said the Foreign Affairs Minister won't be backing another spill and will stand against the Communications Minister if it is brought on, Seven News further reports. 

Other Liberal MPs have revealed that Mr Abbott's supporters said 'if he [the Prime Minister] doesn't turn things around by mid-year he will stand down'.

However some, including coalition frontbencher Steve Ciobo, are denying any such talk of another leadership challenge.

'We had a vote of the party room in relation to a spill motion that has been decided, the Prime Minister continues on with the support of party room,' he told the ABC.

Yet the claims were further reiterated as senior ministers told the Daily Telegraph Mr Abbott no longer has most of the support of his party room, while others tried to crush such reports by saying it was 'madness' to attempt a second spill less than three weeks after the first.

Mr Turnbull was widely touted as a potential candidate if a leadership spill motion went ahead earlier this month

The reports prompted voters to take to social media, some venting their frustration while others showing their excitement about the prospect of '#libspill2'.

'Why are we wasting more precious time on #libspill2 focus on the country?? focus on the issues.. forget about the next election,' Golfon5 tweeted.

'The best thing will be watching Abbott wither on the backbenches... #libspill2,' Ser Danos of Bowles wrote.

On Tuesday, Mr Abbott told Parliament that his government had lost confidence in Prof Triggs after the commission released a report examining the conditions of children held in detention. 

'It's a political stitch-up,' Mr Abbott said of the report.

But the Communications Minister struck a different tone on Wednesday, highlighting Prof Triggs' reputation in the legal community and emphasising the focus should be on children in detention. 

Mr Turnbull was widely touted as a potential candidate if a leadership spill motion went ahead earlier this month.

But he did not stand for the position and Mr Abbott won the vote without a candidate standing against him, 61 to 39.
