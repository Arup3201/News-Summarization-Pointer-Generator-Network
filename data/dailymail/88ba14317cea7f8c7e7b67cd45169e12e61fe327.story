Science teacher Richard West was suspended and later dismissed after accidentally shooting a student with a pellet gun during a classroom experiment

A teacher who was sacked after accidentally shooting a student during a science experiment has got his job back - after the boy he hit led a campaign for him to be reinstated.

Physics teacher Richard West was suspended then sacked because the pellet, fired from an air weapon, rebounded off a table leg and struck sixth-former Ben Barlow in the leg.

The incident, which happened in November last year, left pupil Mr Barlow with a minor scratch and resulted in Mr West being dismissed as head of physics at St Peter’s Collegiate School in Wolverhampton last month.

Mr Barlow, 17, said: ‘Mr West set up an experiment where he was going to shoot through paper into cardboard boxes at the end of the room to work out the speed of the object and its deceleration.

‘I’m not sure how it happened - but the bullet must have rebounded off the table and it hit me on the leg.

‘You’d do more damage with a safety pin. It was a complete accident and Mr West was really concerned.’

The sixth-form student launched a huge Facebook campaign and petition entitled ‘Bring Back Westy 2014’ which called for his favourite teacher to be given his job back.

The campaign, which was backed by 4,500 past and present pupils, was successful and Mr West was reinstated after an appeals committee granted his return.

The school – of which One Direction star Liam Payne is a former pupil - has agreed for Mr West, of Bridgnorth, Shropshire, to return to lessons after the Easter holidays on April 28.

Adrian Richards, the school’s principal, said: ‘An appeals committee formed from the academy governing body met in response to an appeal lodged by Mr West regarding his dismissal.

‘The appeals committee made the decision to reinstate Mr West with immediate effect.

‘The committee considered all of the factors presented to them, bearing in mind that the primary focus was on safety of students being of paramount importance, how procedures to ensure the safety of everyone must be adhered to, and how important it is that staff report any accidents which happen on academy premises.

‘In being reinstated, Mr West has given assurances that lessons have been learned.

‘He will ensure complete compliance with all safety procedures and controlled conditions and ensure the correct reporting procedures are followed.’

The school, which caters for 1,300 pupils aged 11-18, was rated Good or Outstanding in a November 2011 Ofsted report.

Pupils past and present, as well as former staff members, said Mr West was an ‘inspirational’ teacher.

On Monday night, the ‘Bring Back Westy’ Facebook page said: ‘Guys, we did it! He will be reinstated on the 28th of April.’

And former pupil Julia Bugler wrote: ‘So very please for Mr West, pupil power at its best.

‘Small minded people and those with no faith in this teacher really need to take a long look at themselves.

‘Brings to mind the passage in the Bible about casting the stones.’

Another campaigner, Amy Frost, wrote: ‘Fantastic news.

‘Well chuffed for him and so proud of current students and fellow alumni that showed this incredible amount of support.

‘Just goes to show what a strong campaign will do.’

Parent Emma Steventon added: ‘What fantastic, brilliant and excellent news.

‘The boys and I are so pleased. They have their form tutor and Physics teacher back.

‘I am so glad the right decision was eventually made, well done all involved.

‘I bet Mr West is so pleased and happy it is all over, just get him back to school now to see all his mates and pupils, what a day that will be for him.’

Principle Adrian Richards said: 'In being reinstated, Mr West has given assurances that lessons have been learned. He will ensure complete compliance with all safety procedures and controlled conditions and ensure the correct reporting procedures are followed'
