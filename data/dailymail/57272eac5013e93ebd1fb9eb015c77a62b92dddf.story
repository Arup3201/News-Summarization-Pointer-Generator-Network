Threats: Isabel, seven, and sister Ellie-Louise Cox, four (back row) with their three-year-old neighbour Caidence Leadbetter who have been threatened with Asbos

The parents of three young children are furious they have been given an 'intimidating' police letter for playing outside.

The letter, written by a police community support officer, highlighted alleged ‘anti-social behaviour’ near homes in Smiths Wood, Solihill.

Parents of Ellie-Louise Cox, four, and her sister Isabel, seven, believe the police were referring to their children as well as neighbour Caidence Leadbetter, who is just three years old.

The letters said elderly neighbours had complained of 'minor damage' to trees, the 'trampling of plants' and 'slightly intimidating behaviour'.

Angry mother Claire Cox, 30, said: 'I'm totally shocked.

'The reason I know the letter is aimed at them is because they are the only children in the area who play in front of the houses.

'There are other older children who live nearby, but they do not play near here. The older ones go to the local park.'

While Caidence's mother, Kelly, felt her daughter, who does not start primary school for another year, had been branded 'a yob'.

She said: 'Caidence plays outside our home but she's never caused any trouble. She's the sweetest little girl you could hope for.

'I can't believe the police are basically accusing her of being some kind of anti-social yob. It's madness.'

The letters were sent by a PCSO from Solihull Police to, who stated: 'Reports have been received about a rise in anti-social behaviour. 

'It is understood that children like to play outdoors, however this has been observed to extend to minor damage to nearby trees and trampling of plants underfoot.

'This is not an ideal situation and is perceived as slightly intimidating to elderly neighbours to see any large groups of children congregating.

'If any subsequent damage is identified it may well be the case that Solihull Council will be informed and indeed may act accordingly.'

Mrs Cox said she was stunned by the letter as most of her elderly neighbours enjoyed listening to the little children playing outside.

She added: 'I'm lucky I live in a road where they can safely play outside and I encourage them to play out as much as possible.

'During the school term they go out between 4pm and 5pm and during the holidays they go out at about 11am.

'I don't want them sat in the house all day watching TV. I would like to know who they can possibly intimidate in the area?

'I realise now that they were not going to face Asbo orders, but when you get a letter like that coming through your door, from the police, it scares you.

'There are a lot of elderly people who live nearby, but there are no problems with most of them.

'In fact, I think they like to hear the sound of children playing outside.'

According to West Midlands Police, the letter was sent out to everyone in the area.

Superintendent Kevin Doyle, who is in charge of policing in Solihull, said: 'The neighbourhood police letter was a general reminder about anti-social behaviour; it was not aimed at any family in particular.

'There was no mention of Asbos in the letter and, legally, we cannot issue the orders to anyone under 10-years-old'

He added: ‘West Midlands Police take anti-social behaviour very seriously because of the negative impact it can have on our communities.

'That said, we certainly don’t want 
to stop children from enjoying the outdoors particularly during the 
summer months - but when we get reports of anti social behaviour from 
residents we understandably must act.'

The letters were sent just a week after the Mail revealed that children in Kings Heath had reclaimed three streets from traffic to mark National Play Day.

The event, last Wednesday, mimicked a pioneering scheme from Bristol where parents apply for licenses for regular street closures to encourage kids to play out.
