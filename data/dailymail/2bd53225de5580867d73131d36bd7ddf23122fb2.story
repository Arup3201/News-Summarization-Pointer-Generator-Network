It's the deadliest form of skin cancer, claiming 9,500 Americans each year, with the average life expectancy after diagnosis a matter of months.

But now a new experimental drug is providing hope for patients with advanced melanoma by changing the course of treatment.

Called nivolumab, esearchers say the drug uses the body’s immune system to target and fight cancer cells and has helped some patients with advanced melanoma keep their cancer in check over a period of many year, according to ABC News.

Some even saw a reduction in their tumor masses during the clinical trial.

However, while it is hoped the drug becomes available in about 18 months, it will come at a huge price, with rumored price tags of about $40,000 per patient per month.

Patients diagnosed with melanoma that have been trialling the drug survived for an average 16.8 months following initiation of treatment

Melanoma is difficult to fight because it can turn off the body¿s ability to naturally attack the cancerous cells

Melanoma is hard to fight because it can turn off the body’s ability to attack the cancerous cells.

These new drugs keep your immune cells active, so as the tumor adds new cells, the immune system is able to remove them.

The drugs are classified as immunotherapy.

Patients who showed responses to the drug survived for an average 16.8 months following initiation of treatment.

Overall, 62 percent of patients were alive one year following treatment initiation, and 43 percent were alive two years later.

Average survival among 33 patients whose tumors shrank significantly was two years.

The drug is now being tested in three larger, phase III trials in melanoma, which generally compare a new therapy with a standard one currently in use.

Results of the study were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

Melanoma is particularly common among Caucasians, especially northern Europeans and northwestern Europeans living in sunny climates

Early signs of melanoma are changes to the shape or color of existing moles or, in the case of nodular melanoma, the appearance of a new lump anywhere on the skin

'The results seen here are remarkable for these patients with treatment-resistant, advanced metastatic melanoma, who had limited life expectancies when they joined the trial,' says study lead-author Suzanne Topalian, M.D., professor of surgery and oncology, and director of the melanoma program at Johns Hopkins.

While clinical trials have been promising, researchers point out that the drugs are not a cure.

Doctors still maintain that the best course of action is catching melanoma early.

Always check your skin for any new spots, or moles that look different or change color.

Anything larger than a pencil eraser should be properly checked by a doctor.
