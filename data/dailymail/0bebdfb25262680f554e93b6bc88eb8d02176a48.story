A government solicitor allegedly thought it a quantum leap for a 14 year old girl whose breasts were fondled by a licensed carer to allege 'sexual interference'.

A child sex abuse inquiry has been told the NSW social services department, DoCs, was informed by a welfare officer in 1983 of the abuse of Leonie Knight by the man running the Bethcar home for Aboriginal children in Brewarrina, in the state's northwest.

Ms Knight has told the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse she was frequently molested and then raped by Burt Gordon who ran Bethcar with his wife Edith and their son-in-law Colin Gibson from 1969 to 1989.

Gibson was jailed in 2007 on two sentences of 12 years and 18 years but Gordon died before the case against him reached court.

The commission is examining how the State of NSW handled civil litigation commenced in 2008 by 15 former residents of Bethcar who were beaten and raped at the home, some when they were as young as five.

The NSW Crown Solicitors Office (CSO) employed solicitor Evangelos Manollaras and briefed barrister Patrick Saidi to defend the claim.

Senior solicitor at the CSO Helen Allison supervised the case until 2010.

On Friday, Ms Allison who is on day-two of her evidence, defended her advice to reject settlement and defend the case.

She said there were question marks over the state's duty of care to the residents even though Gordon had a licence from the NSW government.

The commission has heard DoCs officers working at Brewarrina reported abuse at the home from 1980.

A letter from Mr Manollaras to Mr Saidi commenting on a statement from one of those officers was read on Friday.

Mr Manollaras commented that Ms Knight had exaggerated her account of abuse by Gordon.

She had complained Gordon comforted her by hugging her and fondling her breasts.

The solicitor wrote, '... a distressed child could be comforted in a normal manner by a hug and a kiss. Granted I am having a problem with the fondling of breasts, but I still think it is a quantum leap, even if there was some fondling of breasts, to conclude sexual interference.'

Ms Allison agreed on Friday that it did reflect a serious misunderstanding of what sexual abuse of a minor might involve.

'Look I don't accept what was said there at all', Ms Allison said.

On Thursday, Ms Allison said she had a hands-off approach to supervision of the case.

Evidence has been given that each of 15 plaintiffs was asked to prove they had been abused, even though the state had already jailed one of the abusers, and that the state rejected mediation even after a district court judge suggested it.

The case was finally settled at mediation earlier this year.

The hearing continues in Sydney.
