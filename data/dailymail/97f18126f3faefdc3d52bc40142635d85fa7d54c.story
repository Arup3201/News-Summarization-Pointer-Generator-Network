A teenage thug who kicked and burned a cat to death after downing a bottle of whisky has walked free from court.

Lance Elgar, who was living on a farm in Nether Heyford, Northamptonshire, 'lost it' after rowing with his mother before kicking the animal three times with steel toe-capped boots.

While the cat lay paralysed from the vicious assault on April 21 last year, the 19-year-old then picked it up and threw it on a fire.

The animal, which belonged to the owners of a farm where Elgar was living, died after suffering broken bones, fractures, internal bleeding and a severed spinal cord.

The landscape gardener was handed a 12-week prison sentence suspended for two years after he admitted causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.

He was banned from owning animals for 10 years and ordered to pay £2,353.15 court costs and a victim surcharge of £80.

Northampton Magistrates Court heard the cat died after enduring 'extreme pain and suffering'.

District Judge Tim Daber told Elgar it was 'completely incredible' someone would take their anger out on 'a defenceless animal'.

He said: 'Neither arguments, drinking or scratches are any excuse whatsoever. It shows incredible cruelty.

'It is a very close call but your age, remorse and record for making positive contributions to the community have persuaded me to just keep you out of prison on this occasion.'

The court heard Elgar attacked the cat after drinking a bottle of Jack Daniels following a row with his mother. He said the cat then scratched him. 

Prosecutor Janita Patel said: 'We can confidently say that this cat suffered extreme pain and suffering and was most likely still conscious after the first kick.

'This could have left it paralysed which would have increased its fear and anxiety.

'A gentle kick to the head would not have caused this. Extreme force must have been used with an intent to injure.'

Hayley Pearson, defending, said: 'It was a moment of madness and he does not remember putting the cat on a lit fire.

'He had drunk a whole bottle of Jack Daniels and had had an argument with his mother who he had helped to build a house for. Then the cat scratched him and he lost it.'
