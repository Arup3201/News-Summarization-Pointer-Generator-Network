Riding the waves has been given a boost, literally, thanks to the latest electric-powered wakeboard.  

The Radinn board is made of lightweight carbon fibre and travels at up to 25 knots (29mph or 46 km/h) - meaning users don't need a boat to get up to speed. 

The Swedish designers unveiled the board at the Cannes Yachting Festival earlier this month and it is set to retail for €15,000 (£11,800 or $20,000) when it goes on sale next year.

The Radinn board (pictured) is made of carbon fibre. It features a salt-water jet propulsion system and is powered by lithium batteries. Speed is controlled by a wireless remote and the current prototype can travel at speeds up to 25 knots (29mph or 46 km/h), but the firm said the final version is being designed to go faster

Founder and Swedish wakeboarder Philip Werner devised the electric-powered board in 2012, while studying at Lund University.

A prototype was developed, alongside partner Alexander Lind, and engineers Oskar Odén and Filip Böttcher, and the first electric powered wakeboard was revealed in May 2014. 

The Radinn board features a saltwater-resistant jet-propulsion system, and is powered by lithium batteries contained in a waterproof pocket.

The whole board, including battery, weighs 64lb (29kg) and the firm claims it is small enough to fit in a car or boat. Battery life is currently around 30 minutes when travelling at full speed, but tests are being carried out to improve this

Radinn, which is a portmanteau of Radical Innovation, is based Ideon Science Park, Lund in the south of Sweden.

The firm is carrying out further tests of the board before pre-orders begin later this year, and the device is due to go into production in early 2015.

The Radinn is not the first jet-powered board, German-based Lampuga produces its own electric  motor that can be fitted to boards, for example, for €13,600 (£10,000 or $17,500).
