World leaders were greeted by a lavish display from Vladimir Putin at Russia's G20 summit today with a decadent ball which felt a world away from the realities on the ground in Syria.

Women dressed in elaborate Marie Antoinette style costumes met the world's most powerful men and women in a display which seemed to be a celebration of luxury at the Peterhof Palace in St Petersburg.

The images were somewhat removed from the kind of photographs the leaders will be poring over tomorrow when they discuss evidence of the horrifying chemical attacks in Syria which killed 1,400 innocent civilians including children.

The night of revelry saw British 
Prime Minister David Cameron quaffing wine while Putin placed a
 gentlemanly blanket over Angela Merkel's shoulders suggested a thawing 
of relations between the leaders.

However, if this was peace earlier in the day war still raged.

Aggressive public statements emerged from both President Obama and Putin's camps as both attempt to influence the global community and win support for their opposing positions on Syrian intervention.

Putin greeted Obama with a thin smile 
and a businesslike handshake earlier in the day, a clear sign of the 
strains between them.

President Obama said he was convinced that the chemical attack in Damascus last month was the work of the Syrian government and reiterated his position that the world must intervene to prevent further attacks.

He added that the use of chemical weapons is 'not only a tragedy but also a violation of 
international law that must be addressed'.

Meanwhile Putin dismissed the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would risk retaliation by using chemical weapons and called the evidence the U.S. has gathered as 'groundless'.

The Russian leader continues to claim support from China while United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon reiterated the need for security council blessing before any action is taken.

'Let us remember: every day that we 
lose is a day when scores of innocent civilians die,' his office quoted 
him as saying at the leader's elaborate dinner. 'There is no military solution'.

Meanwhile in New York, U.S. Ambassador to 
the United Nations Samantha Power left no doubt that Washington had 
given up trying to work with the UN Security Council over the attack.Â

The extravagant show and air of festivity sat at odds with the gravity of discussions

The threat of missiles over the Mediterranean is weighing on world leaders meeting on the shores of the Baltic this week, and eclipsing economic battles that usually dominate when the G-20 world economies meet

She
 said there was 'no viable path forward in this Security Council' and 
accused Russia of holding it hostage. Moscow has signaled it would veto 
any resolution on the use of force unless Washington produced stronger 
proof.

Obama has asked Congress to approve military action and France has said it is ready to support U.S. intervention.

His aides said he would 
set out his views at the leaders' dinner and hoped to build support for 
military action, although they acknowledged a consensus might be hard to
 find.

Long after midnight, there was still no word from officials on how the dinner discussion had gone.

Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, meanwhile 
portrayed the 'camp of supporters of a strike on Syria' as divided, and 
said: 'It is impossible to say that very many states support the idea of
 a military operation'.

Isolated? Russian President Vladimir Putin sits in Peterhof garden during the summit

There was also tension between Russia 
and Britain, after President Putin's official spokesman Dimitry Peskov 
reportedly wrote the UK off as 'just a small island no-one pays any 
attention to'.

In an 
astonishing attack, Vladimir Putin mocked the UK's size and influence 
and boasted that Soviet oligarchs had 'bought Chelsea'.

It was unclear whether this was a reference to the exclusive London borough or the football club.

Russian officials flatly denied the remarks had ever been made.
