You may not like it. But you can’t ignore it. Part of the bundle you buy when you sit down in front of the box for some Premier League football is the sideline show provided by the bosses for our entertainment.

Some of the gaffers do much of their best work post-match in front of that logo wallpaper. Look nice in the kitchen, that. 

Steve Bruce is often given to scrunching up his face in an attempt not to savage the officials. But the best he can usually manage is to tell us the various reasons he’d LIKE to, but won’t. 

Jose Mourinho and Louis van Gaal embrace in the dug-outs at the final whistle as the two old friends went head-to-head at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon. Manchester United and Chelsea drew 1-1

Mourinho worked as Van Gaal's assistant at Barcelona between 1997 and 2000

While he now has Neil Warnock back there for company, too. The Palace manager’s hair may not budge, but he just can’t stop that tongue from wagging.

There are then those other managers who are quite happy to use the touchline to put on a show. Alan Pardew has been a leading candidate there, but has been polishing up his act a bit of recent times. 

But I bet he comes back all singing, all dancing. And grumpy old stagers Manuel Pellegrini and Arsene Wenger have been so animated of reason seasons, they have quite the Statler & Wardorf act going on.

But leader of the pack in all areas is of course Jose Mourinho. And on Sunday afternoon we got to see quite what performance he’d come up with against an old friend, then foe, Louis van Gaal.

The Sky Sports cameras captured an embrace between Mourinho and Van Gaal in the tunnel pre-match

The pair have been friends for many years and Mourinho encouraged Van Gaal to come to the Premier League

Sky Sports hoped they’d be on to a winner with this one and opened their Super Sunday coverage at lunchtime from an Old Trafford dug out to set up what was to come later in the afternoon. 

Complete with opening credits bearing the music from Disney’s Sorcerer’s Apprentice. Although I’m sure no one expected this to be a Mickey Mouse confrontation.

There was also a nice short film featuring the two masters at work with the media over the years. Just enough to suggest that although it has all been something of a love-in in the past and during the build up to Sunday’s game, there was still just the chance that something was gonna give.

Well, that ultimately didn’t happen but nevertheless there was still much fun to be had watching these these two old pals keep it together as their teams went at it on the pitch.

Geoff Shreeves was going to be the man in the middle for this and pre-match Sky Sports wisely kept the cameras rolling to provide a very real moment. 

Shreeves was half way through interviewing the visiting gaffer when Jose looked up and gave a smile and a wave to someone over Geoff’s shoulder. Turned out it was Van Gaal. 

Their reunion was the centre of attention off the field at Old Trafford as the heavyweights went head-to-head

Chelsea veteran Didier Drogba headed his team into a second-half lead from a corner

Robin van Persie snatched a point for Manchester United in the third minute of stoppage time

As was revealed when the interview finished and the camera swung around to capture the two friends hugging out a big hello.

It then carried on filming and went straight into the chat with the Manchester United boss who told us his old colleague was ‘special. There you are - special’. Not exactly Ali-Frazier, eh?

Come game time, there was even time for the camera to follow Jose into the United dug out for yet more friendly grappling. Then the two men finally took up their more familiar roles - Jose commanding his technical area, and Louis sat firmly in amongst his coaching staff. Which is how the next 90 minutes or so played out.

But for that added bit of drama, it is always handy that Mourinho does stand centre stage. Because it provided us with a brilliant Jose-eye view of the United equalizer. 

Complete with the Chelsea manager’s slumped shoulders of resignation and what appeared to be a short, but to the point piece of unprintable English.

Mourinho was very animated on the touchline all afternoon, issuing frantic instructions to his players

Van Gaal, by contrast, remained in the dug-out alongside his coaching staff

Yet even this late disappointment couldn't shake The Special One out of his bonhomie for the day out at his mate’s place. He told us he was ‘yes, happy. Very happy’. 

And even his attempt to give referee Phil Dowd what for - ‘if I speak of the second yellow I have to start in the first half’ - petered out into the verbal equivalent of a mild finger wag.

We even got a decent chortle out of Van Gaal. ‘We could have win’ - his ‘wins’ and ‘wons’ get a bit mixed up - before chuckling ‘but I say that every game’.

So all in all, it was very much honours even all around. With Christmas card lists remaining firmly intact. Except for poor old Branislav Ivanovic.

Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic was sent off late on and United scored from the resulting free-kick

Geoff Shreeves had once famously announced to him on interview he’d be missing the Champion’s League Final. This time, Branislav was having his early bath when Shreeves once again stuck it to him. Albeit inadvertently.

This happened when he informed goalscorer Robin Van Persie the red carded Chelsea right-back ‘would have picked Fellaini’ in the build up to the goal. ‘Is that so?’, smiled the Dutchman. ‘Makes it even better for us’.

Ouch!
