A ball of flames that could be seen from miles around was sent spiralling into the air on Saturday when two road trains crashed on Berrimah Road at East Arm, near Darwin. 

One driver was in a serious condition after the crash when at least one road train was left engulfed in flames. A road train carrying gravel hit the other one before bursting into an inferno.

The driver of the road train that caught fire was taken to Royal Darwin Hospital with serious burns to large parts of his body, while the driver of the other vehicle escaped without any major injuries.

The crash took place at about 11am only a little more than a kilometre from Darwin's main fire station. This ensured emergency crews arrived swiftly at the scene and put out the fire.  

The ABC reported that the fire was intense. One man, Denis, said he had driven past the site just minutes before the accident.

'It must have happened within minutes really,' he said.

"The one who's in the burnt truck is in a very bad way, he's got some pretty bad burns.

'It was pretty full on.'

One lane of Berrimah Road is closed, causing significant delays for motorists. Northern Territory Police asked people to avoid the area. Police have established a crime scene to investigate the accident and established traffic control to let traffic in and out of East Arm Port.
