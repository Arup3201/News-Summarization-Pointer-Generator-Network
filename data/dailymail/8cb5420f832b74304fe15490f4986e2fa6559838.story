Shrien Dewani chose to go shopping instead of attending a Hindu ceremony to bless his murdered wife's body, his trial was told.

A court heard that Dewani told police officers that he would rather go to a shopping mall in Cape Town than attend the ceremony with his father and Anni Dewani's father, just hours before they flew back to Britain.

Dewani's lawyer told the court in Cape Town that the shopping trip was to buy thank you cards for staff at the hotel, as well as police officers.

He then gave the cards and cash to thank police and hotel staff for looking after him in the days after his wife's murder on their honeymoon, the Telegraph reported. 

It is alleged that Dewani, a bisexual entrepreneur from Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol, arranged the murder of his wife Anni.

But Dewani has pleaded not guilty to murder, kidnap, robbery, conspiracy to commit these crimes and defeating the ends of justice at Western Cape High Court in Cape Town. 

Yesterday new videos released by prosecutors showed Zola Tongo, who has been convicted of killing Anni Dewani, and Shrien Dewani meeting on the morning after the murder.

The two men were pictured in a quiet sitting area of the five-star Cape Grace hotel. Dewani has yet to hear that the body of his wife, Anni, has been found with a fatal gunshot wound to her neck, in the back of Zola's abandoned taxi. Tongo, who claims Dewani hired him to organise her is sitting on the sofa.

Dewani, 34, paces the room, his phone in his hand and is seen speaking to a hotel cleaner who is polishing the window of a door and – according to Tongo – asks him to give them 'some privacy'. The wealthy businessman gives the departing cleaner a grateful smile. 

The men continue to talk, while unshaven Dewani remains standing – Tongo told the court that Dewani repeatedly asked if he had heard whether the job 'has been done'.

After a short time, Zola said he warned Dewani that a security camera was trained on the area and Dewani is seen in the film to suddenly snap his head back to look at a camera high in the corner of the room. He swiftly moves towards the corner of the room, beneath the camera, and out of sight, before leaving the room.

Tongo stays on at the hotel and Dewani returns to talk to him, again asking whether there is any news about the success of 'the job', according to Tongo’s evidence. 

As Dewani continues to pace nervously, and according to Tongo, he talks about the previous night’s fake carjacking which ended with the Swedish bride being driven off into the night by two armed men and speculating about whether his wife is dead or not. 

At one point during the conversation, captured on the Cape Grace hotel’s security camera, Tongo claims he warned Dewani about police officers who were gathered just a few metres away, on the other side of the door, by pointing in their direction.   

A cleaner can been seen on the right hand side of the frame. He exchanges a few words with Dewani and then appears to make his excuses and leave.

Tongo told the court earlier this week that Dewani asked the cleaner to give them some privacy and then asked 'if the job was done', allegedly a reference to a pre-arranged 'hit'.

But Dewani insisted he did not know his new wife was dead at this point and was just having a friendly conversation.

As there is no sound on the copy it is difficult to know exactly what was said.

The driver claims he warned Dewani during the conversation that there were cameras pointed at them. 

At this point Dewani can be seen looking up at the camera then quickly looking away.

Dewani has denied knowing anything about a plot to kill his new bride and said they were hijacked as Tongo was driving them through Gugulethu township in his minibus on November 13.

On Wednesday, Dewani's lawyers claimed the millionaire had been framed for the murder of his wife by his driver and two hitmen after a kidnap and ransom plan turned sour.

In a dramatic twist to the murder hearing, Dewani's senior lawyer told the court a convicted murderer would be called as a witness to describe how Zola Tongo boasted of making Dewani a scapegoat.

Tongo, allegedly told  the 'lifer' that a plan to kidnap Mrs Dewani, 28, and demand a ransom from her wealthy husband ended in murder when one of her two kidnappers attempted to rape her, the court heard.

Bernard Mitchell claimed that Tongo confessed to the plot when the two occupied nearby cells in October 2011. 

The inmate, known as Bino, approached Dewani's lawyers with the confession when Dewani was fighting extradition to South Africa to face charges over his wife's death.

Dewani denies recruiting taxi driver Tongo to organise the murder of his new Swedish wife shortly after they arrived in Cape Town for part of their honeymoon in November 2010. 

Tongo and two hitmen - Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni - claim the successful businessman masterminded the plot to kill the Swedish engineer and promised to pay them £850. 

Dewani's trial continues.
