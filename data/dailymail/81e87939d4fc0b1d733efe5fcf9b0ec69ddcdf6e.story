The optimism of Labour MPs who opted for Ed Miliband as their leader has all but evaporated 

For the more perceptive farmyard turkey, it has been a troubling week. The annual John Lewis advert has hit our TV screens; Oxford Street has a new set of lights; and British pop groups are signing up for another revival of Band Aid.

But at least the turkeys can say they never voted for Christmas –unlike the dozens of Labour MPs who opted for Ed Miliband as their leader four years ago and now face a similarly bleak fate.

Back in the summer, most of those MPs were quietly confident the party would win the Election next May, but that optimism has evaporated.

First, there’s the Nigel Farage factor. For two years, Labour strategists have been saying: ‘If Ukip keep doing well up to 2015, we’ll win a majority.’ Now the fear is that Ukip will do too well next May, taking large numbers of votes off Labour MPs, not just the Tories.

Then there’s the Scottish problem, where the collapse in Labour’s poll ratings has put a huge dent in the party’s chances of forming a majority at Westminster.

That dual threat from Ukip and the SNP will also force Labour to spend money it doesn’t have defending dozens of seats it thought it could take for granted.

But what’s worrying Labour MPs above all is their leader. That Miliband-shaped elephant has been in the room ever since he won the leadership, but his MPs have so far contrived to ignore it.

After all, the polls had been suggesting that even if people didn’t rate Miliband personally, it wouldn’t stop them voting for Labour. There was also a sense that once people got to see a bit more of him, his ratings would get better.

I mean they couldn’t get any worse, could they?

The past six weeks have shattered both illusions. Since his calamitous party conference speech, Miliband’s popularity has plumbed new depths, even falling below Nick Clegg’s.

And in escalating numbers, even lifelong Labour voters – those who stuck with the party in 2010 – are now telling local activists that the ‘Miliband issue’ will affect their decision next time round.

On Monday, one poll put Labour on 29 per cent – the same rock- bottom rating it achieved at that 2010 Election; a shock for Labour MPs who thought things could never get that bad again.

Against that restless backdrop, Miliband executed a mini-reshuffle, prompted by the departure of Shadow International Development Secretary Jim Murphy.

Personally, I would have appointed some hard-nosed hatchet carrier with a remit to plan the department’s abolition and channel Britain’s overseas aid through agencies such as Oxfam instead. Instead, in a move that could charitably be described as defiant, or uncharitably as daft, Miliband used the reshuffle to elevate three of his closest allies.

Most notably, the adviser who managed his leadership bid, Lucy Powell, has been put in full charge of Miliband’s operation and Labour’s campaigning, less than two years after becoming an MP.

Outside Westminster, most people knew little and cared less about these appointments, but inside the party they mattered hugely – not so much pouring oil on Labour’s troubled waters as introducing a shoal of piranhas.

What they said to Labour MPs was that Miliband is not interested in listening to any of their concerns about his leadership. Far from being willing to change, he is cocooning himself ever more tightly in a circle of like-minded acolytes.

So this is the reality that Labour MPs face – they have a leader who is more unpopular than Clegg, but too arrogant either to admit it or do anything about it. And if he is not prepared to change, the question is, what are they prepared to do?

There is one group – the reluctant plotters – who know that openly challenging Miliband may be their only hope, but constantly talk themselves out of it.

They fear that divided parties always lose, that it’s too close to the Election, and that there’s no obvious candidate to take over – not least because none of the current Shadow Cabinet will go near any discussion of plots.

Most of all, with memories still raw of attempted coups against Gordon Brown, they worry about ending up with that worst of all outcomes – a failed putsch, even though Miliband has nothing approaching Brown’s army of spies and bodyguards, not to mention his survival instincts.

If there was a genuine assault on Fort Miliband, their defences would last as long as the Maginot Line.

There is a second group – the professional optimists – who still hope Labour can muddle through and win under Miliband.

Finally, there is a third group – the stoical cynics – who believe the Election is already lost and have no intention of challenging Miliband because they want all the responsibility for the defeat hung round his neck.

But the danger is that May’s Election may be the last chance that Labour MPs ever get to be a party of government.

By the 2020 Election, Britain could be out of Europe, Scotland could be independent and a Right-wing coalition that pushes through boundary changes could be in a position of permanent dominance within an ‘English Parliament’.

If Labour MPs are fearful of that scenario, then May is their win-or-bust opportunity to avert it, and if they believe they cannot win with Miliband, then now is the time to do something about it.

Unlike the Christmas turkeys, Labour MPs do have control over their fate, but their time to use it is fast running out.
