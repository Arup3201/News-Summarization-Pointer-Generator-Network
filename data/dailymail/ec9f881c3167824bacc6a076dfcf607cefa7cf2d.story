I'm a huge fan of make-up and skincare from French pharmacy brands. They combine technological expertise with a chic, elegant look.

We all know how French girls have that je ne sais quoi – an indefinable cool and gorgeousness that seems to come naturally.

Well I think I know the secret to je ne sais quoi: it's these continental cosmetics!

Binky has stayed loyal to her favourite French cosmetic brands despite having a plethora of American make-up available on her doorstep

I've spoken quite a few times about my favourite French skincare products, so this week I'm sharing with you some other products I've been loving of late.

I've been reaching for them non-stop since I've arrived in the Big Apple, so thought it was time to let you guys in on the secret, too!

BINKY'S FRENCH FAVOURITES

La Roche-Posay Rosaliac CC Daily Unifying Complete Correction Cream SPF 30, £13

Binky says that the Rosaliac CC cream makes a great make-up base and calls the Nuxe Prodigieux Le Parfum the scent of the season

CC creams are a recent beauty invention. CC stands for Correction Cream, and these fabulous formulas work to combat skincare issues while also acting as a lightweight make-up base. Rosaliac CC is formulated for sensitive skin that is prone to redness.

The silky formula is enriched with La Roche-Posay Thermal Spring Water and naturally derived Ambophenol, which helps to neutralise long-term redness. Refreshing and non-oily, the cream glides over the skin without leaving any streaks for a truly natural-looking finish.

Nuxe Prodigieux Eau de Parfum Spray, £29.33

Beauty lovers have gone wild for this heavenly fragrance, and I have joined their ranks in declaring it the scent of the season.

Relaxed and exotic, Nuxe Prodigieux Le Parfum is based upon Nuxe's famous Huile Prodigieuse, the bestselling multipurpose oil that moisturises and subtly perfumes the skin. Reminiscent of golden beaches and warm island breezes, this fragrance is quite simply summer in scent.

Eucerin DermoPURIFYER Cover Stick, £6

A cover-up that cares for problem skin, this concealer stick will reduce the appearance of imperfections both immediately and over time. Its oil-free formula is proven to reduce blemishes while calming irritation in even the most sensitive skins.

The nude tinted stick counteracts redness and conceals spots and blemishes with its high coverage, non-irritating texture. I always keep one handy in my handbag in case of sudden breakouts or flushes.

Caudalie Vinotherapie Zeste de Vigne Shower Gel, £7.19

There's nothing like a zesty shower gel to wake you up and get you buzzing in the morning. This energising scent blends notes of flowers, leaves and lemon fruits to leave you refreshed and ready to take on the world!

Not only that, but thanks to its aloe vera enriched formula, this shower gel maintains the skin's delicate pH balance, unlike some harsher cleansers. Which means soft, healthy skin that looks and smells gorgeous!

Binky always keeps the Eucerin DermoPURIFYER Cover Stick in her handbag and loves the Caudalie Shower Gel for a zesty wake-up call

Binky uses the Rene hair mask for when her tresses needs a little extra TLC and loves Vichy sun protection's non-sticky texture

Rene Furturer Karite Intense Nourishing Mask, £18

I'm pretty obsessive about caring for my hair – after all, your crowning glory will only look glorious if you keep it nourished, protected and healthy.

When hair is dry and damaged, it needs some intensive TLC, and this powerful treatment mask works wonders. Its formula boasts the unparalleled moisturising capabilities of shea butter together with conditioning quince pectins, which work to repair and regenerate hair. Your locks are left looking and feeling silky, luminous, strong and bouncy.

Vichy Capital Soleil Dry Oil Spray SPF40, £10.99

I don't need to tell you guys about the importance of protecting your skin with a good sunscreen. The great thing about this Vichy product is its dry oil formulation. Dry oils are intensely moisturising without leaving a greasy, sticky residue.

This one has a silky texture that sinks into the skin rapidly and keeps skin supple and soft whilst helping to protect it from the sun's harsh rays. It also includes powerful antioxidants, which help your skin to stay beautiful for longer.

The oil is paraben-free, water resistant, hypoallergenic, and 100 per cent suitable for sensitive skin. I'll be packing this for my holidays, but even on city summer days I give my legs and arms a spritz before heading out. Silky-smooth, beautifully protected skin – what's not to love!

You can get all these products for up to a third off on Escentual.com this June as it's French Pharmacy Month – what better excuse to add a touch va va voom to your beauty cabinet?

Binky was lucky enough to take a sneak peak at the June Glossybox beauty treats

I've also got a very exciting exclusive for you this week – a preview of the June GLOSSYBOX. As a beauty fanatic I was thrilled to be given the opportunity to preview the box, and this month's products certainly didn't disappoint. The June GLOSSYBOX includes:

My top pick has got to be the Roger and Gallet fragrance – I've been reaching for this fresh and fruity scent every day and adore it. I've also been using the So Susan Blusher to add a gorgeous pink flush to my cheeks – the formulation has a slight shimmer to it so is perfect for adding a subtle highlight to the tops of cheekbones.

Binky is the new face of luxury underwear brand, Bluebella, she says she was completely flattered by the response she has from Daily Mail readers

If you'd like to find out some more information on how to get your monthy GLOSSYBOX packed with luxury beauty goodies delivered to your door for just £10 a month, check out www.glossybox.co.uk.
