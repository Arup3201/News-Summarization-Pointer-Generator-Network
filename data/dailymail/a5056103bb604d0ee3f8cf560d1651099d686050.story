A nine-year-old girl was flung 15ft through the air and smashed into a metal safety barrier after she came off a white-knuckle fairground ride at 50mph.

Yasmin Vickery was rushed to hospital after she was catapulted out of the ride in front of her horrified mother Kim who feared she was paralysed.

The youngster was treated for a suspected broken neck following the accident on November 3 but incredibly escaped with severe bruising.

Yasmin Vickery was catapulted from a white-knuckle 'Twister' fairground ride at 50mph and smashed into a safety barrier in Northampton

The youngster, pictured before the accident carrying the Olympic torch, left, and injured, right, was treated for a suspected broken neck following the accident on November 3 but incredibly escaped with severe bruising.

Mobile phone video footage taken by Kim, 41, shows the moment Yasmin flew off the ride at the Hollowell Steam Rally and Heavy Horse Show in Northampton.

A loud thud can be clearly heard on the clip as Yasmin was slammed into a metal fence.

The film shows the emergency button being pressed and the ride grinding to a halt while a frantic Kim can be heard asking 'Where’s Yasmin?'

Today Kim, a company secretary, described the distressing moment she feared her daughter was dead.

She said: 'Yamsin had been on the ride with her little cousin Kya and the bar came up, as she went to lean to pull it back she came flying off.

'She spun into the air because it was going so fast, then you could hear this almighty thud. She had gone flying through the barrier.

'I was filming the ride and didn’t notice until the ride stopped what had happened, we were laughing and joking at the time.

'But then I just saw my little girl 
in a heap over the other side. My six-year-old daughter Talisha who had 
been watching was in tears, she was petrified - she thought her sister 
was dead.

'When I ran 
across and Yasmin said she couldn’t feel her legs - I thought she was 
paralysed, she could have quite easily have died but she took the brunt 
of the force on her side rather then her head.

'The impact was sideways, but the paramedics said if she had gone through head first she probably wouldn’t be here.

'It’s been every mother’s worst nightmare but I know she is very lucky and it could have been so much worse.

'Most people wouldn’t survive a car crash at that speed, let alone being thrown through the air off a ride.'

Married
mother-of-three Kim, from Sevenoaks, Kent, is now calling for safety 
checks to be made on the ride - which is believed to be run by a 
travelling family from Northampton.

Kim added: 'My concern is if that particular fair ride goes elsewhere the it could happen again.'

Yasmin is still bed-bound, and has been vomiting due to the impact her kidneys took in the accident.

The youngster said: 'It really hurts. I’m not going back to school for a week or more. I can’t put any weight on one leg.'

The incident was attended by the police and ambulance service and is now the subject of a health and safety investigation.

Detective
Sergeant Gavin Suttie, from Northamptonshire Police, said: 'We attended
an incident in Hollowell, where a nine-year-old girl suffered injuries 
as a result of falling off an amusement ride.

'She
was admitted to Northampton General Hospital with internal bruising and
was released on Sunday. The Health and Safety Executive has been 
informed and will be assisted by police in the investigation.'

A Health and Safety Executive spokesman said: 'The HSE is aware of the incident and is currently making initial inquiries.'

Nobody from the fairground was available for comment today.
