A mother-of-five has told of her horror and humiliation after a fellow diner in a McDonald's restaurant hurled insults at her and her disabled son for making too much noise.

Melodie Daly was in the middle of moving houses when she decided to have an early dinner with her five children - including five-year-old Rylee who has severe autism, dyspraxia and sensory processing disorder.

Rylee is non-verbal and makes noises to express himself. Wednesday afternoon was no exception.

The 28-year-old mother says she was shocked when a middle-aged woman approached her in the diner at Cobram, north of Melbourne, to complain about her disabled son.

'You need to leave... the noise is too loud. This is a noise complaint,' the woman told Ms Daly.

What then ensued left the mother-of-five disgusted.

Ms Daly told Daily Mail Australia that the woman then proceeded to call Rylee: 'a spastic' and a 'f****** c***'.

It had already been a stressful day for Ms Daly, having to move houses with five children.

But that day had particularly been a good one for Rylee.

'I'm not sure if you've seen meltdowns by autistic children but that day Rylee was happy,' Ms Daly said.

'He was in a good mood that day because he was quite animated by a toy. 

'So he can't help making the noises that he makes. He is non-verbal. He doesn't know he's making those kind of noises.'

Ms Daly says she was at McDonald's at 4.50pm with her children for an early dinner.

'Then this family walked in with a little boy who was covering his ears because of the noise Rylee was making,' Ms Daly said.

'I really didn't think Rylee was being that loud so I saw no reason for this but I just let it go.'

That's when Ms Daly says a woman, described as being in her 50s, came over to her table and said: 'You need to leave... the noise is too loud. This is a noise complaint.'

Embarrassed by the confrontation, Ms Daly said she explained to the woman that her son was autistic.

'She then just turned around and walked back to her table with the little boy and another younger woman, to which she started to call Rylee some really horrible thing.'

According to Ms Daly, the woman called Rylee a 'spastic' and a 'f****** c***' but had her back turned to Ms Daly and her family.

'It was obvious that she was saying it about Rylee,' Ms Daly said. 

She then recalled the woman say: 'I can't believe you would bring him out in public'.

Ms Daly is hoping that her online appeal will help identify the woman

This prompted Ms Daly to put her kids back in the car and asked to speak with the manager at the fast food outlet's drive-thru.

'As I was talking to him the woman came out and walked past us with a smile and waved,' Ms Daly said.

'It was as if she knew exactly what she had done but just had no remorse.

'But my son, being the beautiful boy he is, smiled and waved back at her. That's when she and the other younger woman who was with her started laughing called him a "f****** spastic".'

After reporting the incident to police, the distraught mother-of-five took to Facebook just hours after the incident with hopes that any witnesses may be able to help identify the woman at McDonald's.

Ms Daly says she won't be silenced by those who bully her and her son

'I am going to stand up and fight for my son because I know nobody else will do it,' Ms Daly said

'This kind of behaviour is just disgusting - I can't even begin to say how angry and upset it made me feel,' Ms Daly told Daily Mail Australia.

'I just wouldn't treat another person like that.

'I want this woman to feel ashamed for what she has done and that it's not okay to do this.'

However Ms Daly says this isn't the first incident of its kind, as she is constantly given judgmental looks when she takes Rylee or her other eldest son Calen - who is also autistic - out in public places.

'Sometimes I just want to walk around in a shirt saying "I have a son with special needs" because of the kind of looks and snide comments I get when I'm out with my kids,' Ms Daly said.

'I would just like people to be more considerate and more aware that although some children may look normal they might have special needs.

'And you know, we are just as welcome to such public places like anybody else.' 

So in an attempt to stand up for her five-year-old son, Ms Daly says she won't be silenced by those who bully her and her son.

'He can't say how he feels so I have to be his voice because it's never okay to be treated like this,' she said.

'I am going to stand up and fight for my son because I know nobody else will do it.'
