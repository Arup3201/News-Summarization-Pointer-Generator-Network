The swan dive in front of the Doug Ellis Stand was reminiscent of Jurgen Klinsmann throwing himself at the mercy of Tottenham’s supporters at Hillsborough 20 years ago. Harry Kane - ‘he is one of us’, as they sing - was more than entitled to launch himself in front of them after scoring Tottenham’s remarkable winner at Villa Park. He deserved it. Spurs, most certainly, did not.

Mauricio Pochettino can hold an inquest into this shambolic performance at a later date, but the facts are that they overcame 10 man Villa to record their first league win in a month.

They did it, partially, because Kane’s enthusiasm inspired some work-shy plodders in this Tottenham team after replacing Emmanuel Adebayor in the 57th minute. Adebayor didn’t fancy this one.

Credit to Kane at the death because every Tottenham fan worldwide watching this game on television was screaming out for Erik Lamela to take the 90th minute free-kick. Kane demanded the ball off him and scored, thanks to a deflection from the unfortunate figure of Nathan Baker in Aston Villa’s wall.

‘Lamela and Kane were on the free-kicks but football is about emotion and confidence,’ admitted Pochettino.

‘He shot and he scored. It was a good decision. We are very happy because in every competition he scores.’ It will certainly take some explaining how Paul Lambert’s team, who scored for the first time in 547 minutes and were a man down when Christian Benteke was sent off, lost this game.

This is six defeats on the spin for Paul Lambert’s team and they are only nine away from equalling Sunderland’s record of 15 in the Premier League, set in 2002/03, now. It could happen.

At least Villa scored, though. Andreas Weimann, this willing workhorse down the right, finished the move after 16 minutes when he slid in to meet Charles N’ Zogbia’s deft, left foot touch.

At that point, Tottenham were building up a head of steam towards their annual November crisis as they searched for their first Barclays Premier League victory since the streaky 1-0 win over Southampton on October 3. Tottenham’s defence, dreadful as it is, needs organisation, structure and discipline if they are to make their way back up the table.

Benteke, who was subdued on his return to the team in the 2-0 defeat at QPR last Monday, had flashed an early header wide of Hugo Lloris’ goal. ‘They couldn’t handle him,’ claimed Lambert and he was right.

He hit the crossbar with another, grafting outside the area and then spinning Tottenham’s defence (it didn’t take much, granted) to carve out the opening.

Up front, Spurs need players who will take responsibility to score goals. Roberto Soldado, who score here last season, spooned an effort hopelessly high over Brad Guzan’s goal after Villa had taken the lead.

Adebayor, through on goal in the first half, was stopped when Guzan timed his run perfectly to pinch the ball of his toes and sent it wide for a corner.

You know things are bad at this club when the fans are demanding ‘we want Levy out’ just minutes before they got the substitution they craved: Harry Kane.

Christian Eriksen, substituted at the break for tactical reasons, was dreadful. ‘It was tactical,’ admitted Pochettino. ‘Sometimes you just need to change.’ Adebayor, also, was borderline disgrace. At one stage the captain Younes Kaboul had carelessly booted the ball high into the night sky from an innocuous cross. What is their problem? No-one knows. At that stage, it was easy to wonder whether Spurs would have the gumption to get themselves back into this game.

Kane saw it differently, immediately directing a header into the arms of Guzan. The kid has spirit.

Jan Vertonghen rose to the challenge and booked for a foul on Ashley Westwood after an hour, catching him with a stud when he came off a long run up to slid into the Villa youngster.

                       MINS PLD    KM       MILES 

Aston Villa                          111.1       69.0

Ashley Westwood    90       12.2         7.6

Tom Cleverley         90       11.4         7.1

Matthew Lowton       90      11.1         6.9

Tottenham Hotspur        115.7        71.9

Ryan Mason             90       11.7        7.3

Nacer Chadli            90       11.2         7.0

Danny Rose             90       11.0         6.8

That led to confrontations all over the field and Benteke, who will be suspended for three games following his dismissal, was next in the frame.

Ryan Mason was the one to call it on with the Villa forward, rutting with Benteke after a man-o-man squabble in front of the dug-outs. ‘I didn’t see it,’ claimed Pochettino. Wise words.

Benteke shoved Mason and referee Neil Swarbrick, who failed to spot Roberto Soladado pushing Villa players around, sent him off.

The Villa forward’s punishment is a three-game ban against West Ham, Southampton and Burnley. He deserves a degree of sympathy.

That incident somehow provoked Tottenham, rattling them and their fans as they hurtled towards defeat.

Incredibly, just when it looked like Pochettino and his team were making a pig’s ear of this game, Nacer Chadli equalised for them after 86 minutes. The Spurs midfielder was at the back stick to score, beating Brad Guzan with their best chance of the game. It was breathtaking stuff.

That’s when the nerves set in around this stadium, with fans pacing up and down gangways as they willed this game to end at one-apiece. There was never any chance of that.

Kane, this talismanic figure in a Tottenham shirt, sent the fans back down to London grinning from ear to ear after his remarkable winner. After this, he really is one of them.
