On January 2, 1996, around 8:20 a.m., Roney, Ernest Canty and Warren McGlone had attempted to rob a PNC Bank in Philadelphia.

Officer Lauretha Vaird, a nine-year veteran with the 25th District, was the first officer to arrive at the scene.

Vaird, a 43-year-old single mother of two boys, died from her injuries. She was the first Philadelphia female police officer to be killed in the line of duty.

Roney and his two accomplices were arrested after police received statements from eyewitnesses.

He was granted a stay of execution from Pennsylvania Judge Gary Glazer on February 1, 2006 until all post-conviction litigation was resolved.

Roney has maintained his innocence throughout the trial and appeals process, despite the testimony of three eyewitnesses who placed him at the scene of the robbery, as well as ballistic and forensic evidence and surveillance video that linked him to the murder.

Prior to his arrest, Roney had released two solo albums as Cool C I Gotta Habit, in 1989, and Life In The Ghetto, 1990, as well as an album with the hip hop group C.E.B. in 1993. He was best known for his hit song Glamorous Life.
