The driver of a pickup truck who was severely beaten by a mob after accidentally hitting a child is now speaking to his family.

Mandi Emerick, daughter of beating victim Steve Utash, said Friday that her father has retained consciousness and is talking, but remains in a confused state, according to the Detroit Free Press.

Utash, who remains in critical condition, was also taken off a ventilator on Thursday evening. He was in a medically induced coma followed the April 2 attack by at least six people.

'When I went up there, they had just taken it out,' Emerick said. 'He made eye contact with me and was able to identify who I was. He said my name and he said, "Mandi, Mandi, I’m sorry, I’m sorry."

He’s not really there,' she continued. 'He’s awake but he’s not really there. Sometimes when I talk to him he knows who I am and sometimes he doesn‘t. The doctors said not to get discouraged because he’s really drugged and coming out of sedation.'

Emerick also said her dad is having flashbacks about the April 2 attack when he was beaten by a mob after he stopped to assist a 10-year-old boy that went into traffic and was hit by Utash’s pickup truck.

Repeatedly, Utash says 'I don’t want to die, I’m sorry,' and, 'Please get them off me,' according to his daughter.

While Utash's prognosis is uncertain, doctors say the fact he is breathing on his own and recognizes commands are positive signs.

'They can’t give me a for sure answer on what’s going to happen,' Emerick said. 'They don’t know if it’s the drugs or something else.

'It’s a pretty big deal and it’s hard not to be discouraged when you’re looking at your dad and he’s looking like he doesn’t know me,' she added. 'He knew who I was at first and a couple hours went by and I asked again if he knew me and he didn’t say anything. It’s really hard.'

Four men and a 16-year-old male have been charged in the beating. Utash, a 54-year-old grandfather is white. His accused assailants are all black.

Family members of Steve Utash spoke to a crowd gathered at Little Rock Baptist Church in Detroit on Thursday to pray for racial peace and for Utash's health.

Latrez Cummings, 19, was charged Thursday with assault with intent to murder and assault with intent to do great bodily harm.

arraigned this week on the same charges and are being held in the county
 jail on $500,000 bonds pending preliminary examinations on April 21.

Utash, a tree trimmer, suffered 
severe head injuries when at least six people beat and kicked him when 
he stopped his truck to help 10-year-old David Harris on Detroit's east 
side.

Deborah Hughes, a 
nurse who lives in the neighborhood, rushed to help the boy and stopped 
the mob from continuing to beat Utash, police said.

David Harris, the boy he ran into, was treated for a leg and other injuries. Police quickly ruled that it had been an accident.
