A mother watched in horror as a monkey tore off one of her eight-month-old baby's testicles at a Chinese zoo before running off and eating it.

The shocking incident, is understood to have taken place at the Guiyang Qianling Wildlife Park in Guìyáng, the capital of Guizhou province in Southwest China.

The mother was changing the infant's dirty nappy when the animal attacked, ripping off the testicle before dropping it onto the ground.

eating it before it could be caught.

recovering in a hospital bed with his mother looking over him. His 
injuries are not life threatening.

The number of monkeys at the park has exploded from 70 to 500 in the last few years, according to Chinese news reports

Although they are fed three times a day by keepers, members of the public like to feed the monkeys too and while there are signs warning against doing so, they do not seem to  be enforced.

Other footage shows one of the monkeys attacking a little girl, nipping her on the fingers as she reaches over to pet it.

The report mentions that the monthly incidents involving the monkeys at Guiyang, of varying degrees of severity, are running in the hundreds.
