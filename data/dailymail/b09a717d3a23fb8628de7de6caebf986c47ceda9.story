A chimpanzee who spent years working as a mascot at one of the biggest casinos in Russia, has been treated for addiction to cigarettes and alcohol.

John was left on the career scrapheap when the practice of employing chimps in such roles was outlawed across the country.

But years of socialising with gamblers had seen John develop a couple of unhealthy vices.

Though casino bosses found John a new home at Gekendzhik Safari Park, in south west Russia, when he could no longer work, he was unable to kick his bad habits.

John continued to smoke thanks to visitors throwing lit cigarettes into his enclosure and began stealing pints of beer from visitors.

Peter Skorsky, deputy director at the safari park, said: ''We saw this and tried to prevent possible "gifts" but he still managed to drink and smoke.'

Eventually, John was sent to the zoo's own form of rehab - a specially built glass enclosure - and his diet was given a radical overhaul.

Healthier and happier: John, pictured at his new home in the Safari-park in Gelenzhik, underwent a change in diet and was put in a special glass enclosure to stop him smoking and drinking

Detox: As well as changing his diet, keepers at the safari park introduced new exercise equipment to help John improve his unhealthy lifestyle

Mr Skorsky added: 'We have developed for him a special diet of fresh fruit and established sports equipment (in his enclosure).

'Now he is cheerful and full of energy and I think (he) was completely rehabbed, getting rid of bad habits.'

John is not the first chimpanzee to develop an addiction to tobacco.

Charlie, a chimp at Bloemfontein Zoo in South Africa, found fame with his habit of enjoying the odd cigarette.

His keepers said that he developed the vice when visitors to the zoo kept handing him lit cigarettes.

But despite his smoking, Charlie actually lived ten years longer than the average chimp living in captivity.

In 2010 a chimp at Rostov Zoo, in western Russia, was kept behind three rows of fences after he began smoking and became an alcoholic.
