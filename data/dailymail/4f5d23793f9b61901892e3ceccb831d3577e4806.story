A first grader in Arizona has died of a respiratory disease that parents fear could be the deadly Enterovirus. 

Public health officials are awaiting the results of tests to determine what disease killed the Vistancia Elementary School student, but dozens of parents aren't taking any chances and pulled their children from school as soon as they learned of the illness. 

Enterovirus D-68 is a nasty strain of a relatively common virus that has sicked hundreds of schoolchildren and killed at least six across the country this fall. Children under age 5 who have asthma or other respiratory problems seem to be especially susceptible.

Concerned: Parents lined up at Vistancia Elementary School to pull their children from class after a report of upper respiratory illness in a first grader. The student later died

Enterovirus cases have been confirmed in at least 20 states and three Canadian provinces, though this would be the case to be diagnosed in Arizona.

There is no cure or treatment for the virus - doctors are left to care for the symptoms and hope it runs its course in a few days. 

Enterovirus cases have been confirmed in nearly every state in the country

The virus is spread through saliva and phlegm, similar to the cold and flu viruses.   

The child fell ill over the weekend and was quickly hospitalized with a respiratory illness. Health officials say they do not yet know what sickened the child.

Administrators at the school in Peoria, outside Phoenix, declined to close the school after the child's death was announced Tuesday. Instead, they said they will shuffle students from the sick child's class into other parts of the school and disinfect the classroom where the student attended.

Word of the sick child spread quickly among parents on Tuesday and by the afternoon, parents were lined up out the door to pull their kids from class. 

'Especially that with that Entovirus that’s going on lately that doesn’t give you a lot of chance to react to kind of when it strikes it strikes pretty hard and quick,' parent Chris Rohde told KTVK-TV. 

Several parents said the planned to keep their children home from school on Wednesday.

'Better safe than sorry,' one parent told the TV station.

The Maricopa County Health Department preached calm, saying: 'We have no reason to believe that students at Vistancia Elementary are at an increased risk for serious respiratory disease.'
