A second woman who had an extra-marital affair with the Mormon doctor on trial for murdering his wife has testified saying that he talked about ways to kill someone.

Anna Walthall took the stand on Wednesday in the ongoing murder trial against Martin MacNeill and she said that she had a six month affair with the married father.

Ms Walthall's relationship with MacNeill came months before his relationship with Gypsy Willis, the mistress that he was seeing at the time of his wife Michele's death.

'Pillow talk': Martin MacNeill's former mistress Anna Walthall testified that he told her he knew how to give someone certain drugs and they would die and it would make it look like a natural heart attack

Cold: MacNeill, a doctor, kept his emotions on lockdown during testimony on Wednesday while his daughters frequently cried on the stand as they accused him of killing their mother

Ms Walthall's testimony is particularly relevant because she says that the doctor told her that he knew a way to kill someone and make it look like a natural heart attack.

She told the Utah court that during 'pillow talk', MacNeill told her: 'There's something you can give someone that's natural that's a heart attack that's not detectable after they have a heart attack.'

That goes directly in line with the prosecution's argument as they allege that MacNeill forced his wife to have a face lift and then he plied her with unnecessary drugs effectively forcing a heart attack.

The defense tried to discredit Ms Walthall as a witness by bringing up her former multiple personality diagnosis.

She is the second former mistress of MacNeill who has been brought in front of the court, as Willis spent two days on the stand earlier in the week.

Today she was just mentioned by three of MacNeill's eight children who were all questioned.

All three of the daughters who testified today- Sabrina, 19, Vanessa, 32, and Alexis Somers who now uses her mother's maiden name rather than MacNeill- believe that their father killed their mother in order to pursue his relationship with Willis.

Speaking out: Daughter Alexis Somers, who had suspected the affair, also testifies on Wednesday

Warning signs: Alexis Somers, who now uses her mother's maiden name, is a doctor and she questioned why her father was giving her mother so many painkillers in the days leading up to her death

Just days after Michele was found dead in the family's bathtub, Alexis received a phone call from her father saying that he had found a nanny for her younger siblings.

She told the court that he started to say that the nanny's name was Jillian and she cut him off.

'You mean Gypsy Jillian Willis? I know that woman and I know that mom was worried about you having an affair with her and you are not to bring her into this home,' Alexis recalled telling her father.

'He got irate. He was screaming at me, "How dare you, how dare you accuse me?"'

The court had never been told that Michele had suspicions about her husband cheating before, but Alexis said that her mother had paid a service to track a phone number that her husband had been calling. That number was registered to Gypsy Jyll Willis.

The two other daughters who testified on Wednesday said that  Willis was brought to their Pleasant Grove home just days after their mother, Michele, died in 2007.

Other sisters - the MacNeills had eight children - have previously testified that Willis was the doctor's mistress around the time of his wife's death.

Heartbroken: Vanessa MacNeill, one of the daughters of a doctor accused of killing his wife in 2007, testified today that she wasn't worried her father was having an affair as the woman was nothing like her mother

Emotional: Vanessa MacNeill is one of four sisters who have testified in the ongoing murder trial

'She made spaghetti once, and that was the only time she cooked,' said Sabrina, a Utah State University student who was adopted by the family from the Ukraine. 'She didn't do anything.'

She added that Willis would go into the father's room late at night and take vacations together - but would leave the house separately to avoid raising suspicions.

Vanessa MacNeill, another of the couple's daughters, sobbed as she testified on Wednesday and told juror that she had volunteered to move home and help with her sisters - but her father said no.

'He said that everybody needs to get back to their lives,' Vanessa, 32, said. 'That he was going to hire a nanny… that things needed to get back to normal.'

Vanessa was asked to help interview 
candidates for the job but only Willis turned up and her father claimed 
that all others had canceled, the Deseret News reported.

She also said she told her sister, Alexis Somers, not to worry about 
the woman after she said she feared she was having an affair with their 
father.

Testimony: Sabrina MacNeill, 19, said that her father's mistress was hired as a nanny but did little to help

In court: Martin MacNeill, pictured Wednesday, is accused of killing his wife so he could continue the affair

'I told her not to worry,' Vanessa MacNeill said. 'I was convinced that [Willis] wasn't somebody to worry about, that my dad might be involved with... because she was nothing like my mom.'

Vanessa is the biological mother of 12-year-old Ada MacNeill, who found Michele's body on the day she died. The MacNeills adopted Ada, who is expected to testify at a later date.

Another of the couple's older 
daughters, Alexis Somers, testified Wednesday that Willis would come and
go throughout the day, and seemed more focused on the doctor than the 
children.

'I never saw her 
pick up the children or do any cooking or cleaning,' Somers said. 'I saw
her follow my dad around a lot. I saw them leaving together often.'

Prosecutors
say Martin MacNeill, 57, hounded his wife to get cosmetic surgery so 
that he could poison her with prescription drugs as she recovered. She 
was found passed out in the bathtub. 

Mistress: He was having an affair with Gypsy Willis, pictured leaving court on Tuesday, at the time of the death

Picture perfect: Martin and Michele MacNeill, who died in April 2007 after a facelift, had eight children

They say his motive was to get rid of his wife so he could be with Willis.

In previous testimony, Willis said she traded text messages with the doctor 30 times that day and that they had been involved in a 'casual' affair for 15 months before the death.

She said she texted suggestive photos of herself to him just one day after his wife's funeral - and moved in eight days after that. Within months, he had proposed with a $7,000 ring.

Defense lawyers argue Michele MacNeill had a heart attack and fell into the tub in April 2007 in their home in Pleasant Grove, about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City.

No witness saw how she got in the tub or how she ended up taking the pills.

The trial is in its eighth day and it is expected to run through mid-November.
