A fist-pumping run down the line, a rare win and a red card for the new boy. Life is rarely dull for Neil Lennon and his start to life as a manager in England was no different.

He waited six months for this chance, first eyeing a position in the Premier League and then, in time, the vacancies at Cardiff and Fulham. Some of his calls around the houses were answered, a few were ignored. No-one seemed to want a man who led Celtic to a win over Barcelona not so long ago.

So here he is at Bolton. They were bottom of the Championship going into this one; they finished it with only their second win of the season and their new boss in the stands.

He demonstrated his energy for management with a Mourinho-style dance down the line when Matt Mills headed Bolton in front in the first half. He ended up in the stands for leaving his technical area one too many times when Bolton won a late penalty, which Craig Davies missed.

‘A few times the lady (the fourth official, Amy Fearn) warned me,’ Lennon said. ‘I tried dealing with it with a bit of humour. I wanted to make a decent impression.

‘She said I was consistently doing it. But you have to understand it was my first game.’

And with it, Bolton are off the bottom of the table. ‘It is a start,’ Lennon said. ‘Let’s get out of the bottom three quick as we can. One out of one is all I can ask. For us it is a huge win - a clean sheet away and three points. I am delighted for the club.’

For Birmingham, it means they have now won only once in 11 games in all competitions. It is a run made more understandable when you consider how they defended in the first half here.

Time and again, they failed to mark in a competent manner. With deliveries of quality from Jay Spearing, it was only going to be a matter of time before they found themselves in a familiar situation. It was from a Spearing cross after 20 minutes that Mills headed past Darren Randolph for the winner.

Yet this was as much a game where Birmingham could have taken a point, such were the chances they had. David Cotterill and Demarai Gray both hit the bar, while Gray drew two other good saves from Andrew Lonergan.

‘We are frustrated,’ said Birmingham manager Lee Clark. ‘It seems to be that way (at the moment). We don’t get our rewards.’

Randolph was sent off for fouling Craig Davies in the 83rd minute, prompting Lennon to leave his area to advise Spearing or Lee Chung Yong to take the penalty. He was sent off and the message didn't get through. What drama.
