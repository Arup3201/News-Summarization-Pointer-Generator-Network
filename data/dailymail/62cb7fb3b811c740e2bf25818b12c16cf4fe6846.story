A 64-year-old grandmother has died after being savaged by an American Bulldog in her own home. 

Mother-of-four Rhona Greve, 64, suffered neck and face injuries after she was mauled by the out-of-control dog, Solo, owned by a 23-year-old male who is believed to be her relative. 

Paramedics found the widow badly wounded at her home in Ely, Cardiff, at around 10pm on Friday and rushed her to University Hospital of Wales where she later died.

Neighbours said there had been a dog living at the house 'for years' and children were often seen playing in the garden. 

Mrs Greve's husband Malcolm died five years ago, and she has four grown-up children.  

Neighbour added: 'You always saw a lot of children and young people at the house.'

Officers were called to the home in Ely shortly after 10pm on Friday to reports that a 64-year-old woman had suffered serious injuries

Another said: 'She was a real lover of people and their pets. She loved having people around and their pets too.'

Flowers and tributes have been laid at the house which has now been taped off by police. 

Superintendent Andy Valentine from South Wales Police said: 'This is tragic incident, which I know will shock and upset the local community.

'The woman's family are understandably extremely distressed and are being supported by specially trained police officers.

'I would like to reassure local residents that this is an isolated incident and a thorough police investigation into what happened on Friday is being conducted.

'I would also like to thank the local community for their support and co-operation during the investigation so far.'

Local councillor Susan Goddard said: 'This is a terrible tragedy, it's just too awful to comprehend. It's terrible.' 

A 23-year-old man has been arrested and charged with two offences under the Dangerous Dogs Act. He is due to appear before magistrates in Cardiff today. 

It is understood he is a member of her own family who was visiting with his dog.

A 17-year-old male who was also arrested in connection with the incident is on police bail pending further inquiries.  

In February last year, six-day-old baby Eliza-Mae Mullane from Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire, died from a serious head injury after being attacked by a dog.

According to NHS data, as of 2014 there have been 4,263 admissions to hospitals in Wales from dog attacks since 1999. 

Local councillor Susan Goddard said: 'This is a terrible tragedy, it's just too awful to comprehend. It's terrible.'
