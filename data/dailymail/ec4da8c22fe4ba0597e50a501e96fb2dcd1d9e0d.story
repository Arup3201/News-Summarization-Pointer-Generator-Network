Tragic: Joe Simons died after taking ecstasy

A father has attacked a celebrity culture which 'glorifies and trivalises' drug taking after his 16-year-old son died from taking ecstasy sold to him at a nightclub.

Public school deputy head Tom Simons said his son, Joe, was the victim of a ‘complacent’ approach to drug use, which he said was ‘spreading like a cancer’.

Joe, who had nine A* GCSEs, was let into the club despite being under-age and bought 1.5g of the ecstasy powder MDMA from a dealer inside, an inquest heard.

He collapsed hours later and died in hospital the following day. It was only the second time he had used the drug.

Yesterday his friends told the hearing that dealers were ‘openly’ selling drugs at Lakota nightclub in Bristol, which had its licence suspended after Joe’s death.

In a statement read to the inquest, Mr Simons, deputy head of £25,000-per-year Prior Park College in Bath, said: ‘Joe is in many ways an indictment of our failure as a society to tackle the scourge of drugs. There are no easy answers of course and we are daily beset by the views and advice of the well-meaning and the misguided, urging us to legalise drugs or build more jails.

‘It is complacency that is the greatest challenge to us all. We never think it will happen to us or our loved ones. We trust it will not be our child who will be tempted.'

He continued: ‘Until society as a 
whole stands up and says no to the dealers and no to those in the media 
and entertainments industry who glorify and trivialise the taking of 
drugs, we will continue to count the cost in lives lost and families 
left bereft.’

The 
51-year-old added: ‘It is our profound hope that Joe’s untimely death 
will serve as a warning to young people of the dangers of taking drugs 
like MDMA and the far from benign influence that some would have us 
believe the ‘soft’ drugs culture has on young people.’

The inquest at Flax Bourton, near Bristol, was told that Joe – an A-level student at Beechen Cliff sixth form, in Bath – went to the club on April 30 last year and bought around 1.5g of the white crystalline substance, some of which he took with water.

His best friend, Gabriel Wheatcroft, told the inquest that after Joe became ill, ‘I heard one of the door staff saying that if they were asked, they would say he bought it earlier from another club’. Joe died in hospital.

Shortly after his death, Mr Simons said: ‘Joe died, in part, because the system failed to protect him that night and it seems to me that this is, at least in part, due to indifference to the hedonistic and destructive culture of drug-taking that seems to be more and more a routine part of nightlife for young people.’

Toxicology results revealed that Joe had 0.98 micrograms of the drug in his blood. Pathologist Dr Edward Sheffield said a normal recreational level for the drug would be about 0.2 micrograms.

Mr Simons told the inquest his son’s death had been a ‘tsunami’ on their family – as Joe’s mother Brenda had died from lung cancer three years ago.

Terence Moore, assistant deputy coroner for Avon, gave Joe’s cause of death as toxicity due to ecstasy.
