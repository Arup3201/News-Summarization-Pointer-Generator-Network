Unfair: Danny Cohen, the head of BBC TV, says viewers and critics are praising critically-acclaimed big budget U.S. series at the expense of home-grown dramas

A top BBC executive has blasted the perception that American TV shows are far superior to their UK counterparts and defended British drama as the best   in the world.

Danny Cohen, the head of BBC TV, says viewers and critics who laud critically-acclaimed big budget U.S. series like Breaking Bad, The Wire and Mad Men   are unaware of what the average British viewer is actually watching.

He says wildly successful British dramas such as ITV's Broadchurch, Downton Abbey and gritty police drama Happy Valley are proof that audiences prefer   home-grown content.

'A trope has developed, a cultural meme that asserts that American drama is far superior to drama produced in the UK and at the BBC,' he said.

'It's an argument driven by box-set consumers who have a louder voice in Britain's cultural dialogue than the average family who sit down at night in   Britain's towns and villages to decide which drama they want to watch.'

Over the last 15 years, and arguably starting with HBO's mafia epic The Sopranos, American broadcasters such as HBO and AMC have attracted praise for   producing sophisticated, intelligent and big-budget drama series.

The fact that prohibition-era crime drama Boardwalk Empire's pilot episode was directed by Martin Scorsese and cost £11m to produce indicates the   importance TV executives place on their programming.

Other countries have followed suit, as evidenced by the success of Denmark's The Killing.

But
 with viewing figures of more than 10million per episode for domestic 
hits like Sherlock and Downton Abbey - and the enormous success of these
 shows   throughout the world - he says Brits should be crowing about 
their success on the smaller screen.

Mr
 Cohen, who earns £327,800 a year, wrote in his blog: 'In Britain, we are 
not very good at celebrating our success. We somehow find it 
embarrassing.'

Police dramas: Broadchurch, which will soon be re-made in an American setting, drew more than 10million viewers for the finale. Criminal drama The Killing generated column inches but just under 600,000 viewers

Fantasy: The series 4 debut episode of Game Of Thrones on Sky Atlantic attracted 1.2m viewers. As well as viewing figures regularly topping 10million, Dr Who has also been sold around the world

Although 
it is difficult to get an accurate idea of viewing figures because of 
the changing ways viewers watch content, such as on-demand services like
 BBC   iPlayer and 4OD, as well as paid subscription services like 
Netflix and Amazon Prime, the figures appear to back up his views.

Episodes
 of ITV's Broadchurch - which, interestingly, is soon to be re-made for 
American audiences - drew in more than 10million viewers.

The Killing,   which TV reviewers dedicated many column inches to praising, peaked at 599,000.

Dr
 Kerry Gough is senior lecturer in media theory at Birmingham City 
University and says the popularity of American TV shows partially stems 
from the frustration of following a series week after week, which has 
led to the 'Box Set Britain' mentality.

With the vast array of articles written about it, you'd think everyone in the UK was glued to Mad Men every week. But on BBC 4 it had 355,000 viewers

Downton Abbey is incredibly popular in the U.S. Some viewers even hold viewing parties

HBO gangster epic The Sopranos has been hailed as the start of the renaissance of American TV drama

She added: 'American dramas have big budgets and special effects and is almost becoming the new film. British dramas go back to the roots, with relationships and the gravity of what is happening.

'They have more depth to the characters and are more engaging. But some shows like Game Of Thrones do both and it's a very savvy move by U.S. drama.'

Critical U.S. darling Mad Men attracted 355,000 viewers at one point, whereas ITV's Downton Abbey regularly enjoys more than 11million viewers.

Fantasy epic Game of Thrones is among the most successful U.S. imports and drew in 1.2million viewers on paid-for channel Sky Atlantic for   the season 4 debut.

However, some episodes of the BBC's global smash Doctor Who enjoy nearly ten times as many.

The third series of Ripper Street is being made by online giant Amazon after the BBC axed the Victorian crime drama.

The show, set in London's Whitechapel in 1889 - six months after the gruesome Jack The Ripper Murders, was axed by the BBC at the end of last year due to poor viewing figures.

There were also some issues with sound -  with dozens of viewers complaining to the BBC about  'meaningless mumbling' throughout the second series.

But thankfully for fans, it was saved by online retailer Amazon - who have funded the third series along with production company Tiger Aspect.

It will be aired on Amazon Prime Instant Video - formerly LOVEFiLM - in the autumn before being shown on BBC One a few months later.
