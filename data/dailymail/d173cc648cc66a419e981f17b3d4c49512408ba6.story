The savage riots last month could have led to the death of police officers, the Met has warned, after shocking new footage emerged of a mob attacking patrol cars with bricks and metal railings.

The video shows hooded youths smashing in the windows of a police car with café tables and chairs and hacking off a wing mirror.

The frenzied attackers, wearing dark clothing and scarves over their faces, were filmed in Woolwich at around 8pm on Monday, August 8, wrecking the car with makeshift weapons including metal bars and street signs torn from the pavement.

A brave bystander tries in vain to remonstrate with the group, before a policeman with a riot shield can be seen fleeing the violence.

Further horrifying CCTV footage, shot
in the same area less than a minute later, shows one of the same boys hurling a concrete slab through the windscreen of an unmarked Met police car.

Wearing a distinctive adidas hoodie, he screams wildly before reaching through the window to punch the driver, who was left with cuts to his face.

Appeal: Rioters in Woolwich, south-east London, attacked police and set stores alight in August. The Met are now appealing for help in identifying the thugs

Last month’s riots were the result of a ‘broken penal system’ that has failed to rehabilitate the hardcore ‘criminal classes’, according to Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke.

He revealed that almost 75 per cent of those aged over 18 charged with offences committed during the riots had prior convictions.

Mr Clarke, pictured, said reform was vital to prevent reoffending among ‘a feral underclass, cut off from the mainstream in everything but its materialism’. He also expressed concern at ‘the instinctive criminal behaviour of apparently random passers-by’.

His remarks will be seen as bitterly ironic by Right-wing Tory MPs, who blame him for threatening their party’s reputation on law and order with a series of ‘soft sentencing’ policy proposals, which had to be overruled by Downing Street.

Writing in the Guardian, Mr Clarke said: 'It’s not yet been widely recognised, but the hardcore of the rioters were in fact known criminals. Close to three quarters of those aged 18 or over charged with riot offences already had a prior conviction.'

He said he supported the judges, court staff and police, saying that rioters met a firm and speedy response, and praised those who worked 35-hour shifts to bring the guilty to account.

Borough Commander Richard Wood said: ‘The man in the footage could have seriously hurt or even killed one of the officers in the vehicle.'

He condemned the 'extreme violence' 
as police released the footage of the episodes in Beresford Square and 
appealed for information.

Commander Wood said: ‘Members
of the public have provided police in Greenwich with several 
investigative leads in the past couple of weeks and we are very grateful
for all the help and support we have received.

‘However, we need more help and information to identify this violent individual.

‘If you know who he is, please call us in confidence.’

Police said officers could have died or been seriously injured during the attack in south-east London.

Their primary suspect is a black man wearing a dark top with a hood and blue or green adidas logo.

Witnesses are asked to contact police in Greenwich on 020 8284 9449 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Meanwhile,
as the effects of last month’s riots took a heavy toll on retailers, 
the High Street has recorded its worst results in two years.

Shops reported a drop in profits of 2.2 per cent, according to accountancy firm BDO's High Street Sales Tracker.

The
widespread looting and destruction saw stores including Comet, Currys, 
Carpet Right and JD Sports come under attack across London before 
violence spread to other cities.
