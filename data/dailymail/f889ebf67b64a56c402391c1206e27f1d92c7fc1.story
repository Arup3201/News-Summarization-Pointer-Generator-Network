Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone was cleared of bribery charges yesterday after he paid a German criminal court £60million.

The case has caused anger in Germany where critics said Ecclestone – who was accused of paying a banker a £27million bribe – had been ‘washed clean’ thanks to his ‘spectacular’ payment.

Campaigners said allowing the defendant to use his wealth to stop a criminal prosecution was ‘worrying’.

Munich District Court agreed to end the bribery trial yesterday when Judge Peter Noll announced that the offer was ‘acceptable’. It is the largest sum of its kind ever paid to settle a court case in Germany.

The decision means Ecclestone, 83, leaves court a free man with no stain on his character. Had he been found guilty he could have faced up to ten years in jail.

Robin Hodess, of anti-corruption movement Transparency International, said: ‘We need the law itself as a disincentive to bribery and corruption, and such settlements are a worrying trend, because we could see that more and more companies and individuals look for this way out.’

Germany’s former justice minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger called the deal an ‘impertinence’ that was ‘out of step’ with the process of law, adding: ‘Justice must not be traded off in this manner.’

She told a German radio station: ‘It doesn’t just leave a bad taste, it is really barefaced cheek.’ The politician called on lawmakers to tighten the loophole used by Ecclestone, which is designed to speed up cases for overburdened courts.

News of Ecclestone’s victory made headlines in Germany with media organisations expressing outrage at the outcome of the case.

Newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung attacked the deal in which, it said, ‘the briber is supposed to be washed clean with a spectacular payment’. ‘The saying goes, “Money doesn’t stink”, but that’s wrong here: these millions stink to high heaven,’ it added. The top-selling Bild newspaper denounced the ruling saying it left ‘the bitter impression that not everyone is equal before the law’.

Ecclestone, who is worth some £6billion, was accused of paying a £27million kickback to disgraced banker Gerhard Gribkowsky in 2005, to get him to sell his bank’s holdings in Formula One to a client of Ecclestone’s choosing. The sport’s boss claimed the money was not in dispute but that he paid it because he was being ‘shaken down’ and wanted Gribkowsky to keep silent about his wealth to British tax authorities.

 But German prosecutors say that is false and that the sum was a bribe to get Gribkowsky to sell to a company favoured by Ecclestone, CVC Equity, allowing him to retain absolute authority over Formula One.

Ecclestone claimed at Gribkowsky’s corruption trial in November 2011 that the banker was a man ‘obsessed’ with the sport, who wanted to leave his job at BayernLB bank to become part of it.

He said Gribkowsky had threatened to falsely tell the taxman that Ecclestone, not his wife, was in charge of a family trust – claims that would have made him the target of a tax probe that could have cost him £2billion.

Financial settlements are allowed in German criminal cases if the prosecution, aggrieved parties and the court agree. Around 300,000 deals of this kind are struck in the German justice system every year, but none of this magnitude.

Munich state prosecutors yesterday told the court they would accept Ecclestone’s offer, citing his advanced age and ‘other circumstances’ as factors in their decision.

Judge Noll said: ‘The proceedings will be temporarily suspended with the agreement of the prosecution and the accused, pending payment of the $100-million settlement.’

As he left court, Ecclestone said ‘bye-bye’ to reporters, adding he was off ‘to take care of Formula One’.
