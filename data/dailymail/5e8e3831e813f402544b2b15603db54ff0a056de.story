Gareth Lloyd apologised for the calls and said he did not realise the anxiety it would cause

A bachelor made thousands of nuisance calls telling people his penis was stuck in jam jars and a vacuum cleaner.

Gareth Lloyd, 49, remained silent in some of the phone calls while in others he said his penis was trapped in a variety of household objects.

Lloyd, of Bryn y Coed, Holywell, who cares for his elderly mother, made 5,800 calls from an unregistered pay-as-you-go mobile phone in just three months.

BT traced the number to the unregistered phone but police had struggled to find him.

He was only caught when his number came up on a mobile phone officers were analysing.

Lloyd was given a 12 month community order today after pleading guilty to three charges under the telecommunications act at Flintshire magistrates' court at Mold. 

The court heard how an extensive enquiry was launched to try and identify the nuisance caller. 

But such was the scale of his calls that a number of complainants have never been identified.

Prosecutor Justin Espie said some people had spoken of their upset and anxiety at the calls, made between February and April.

The court heard some of the calls were of a sexual nature but he never went into explicit detail. 

Lloyd admitted making calls which caused annoyance, inconvenience and needless anxiety, and making calls which were grossly offensive but said it was a prank that got out of hand.

He said he never thought he would get caught and never realised the anxiety his behaviour would cause.

Phillip Marshall-Thomas, defending, said he was sure that the majority of calls would have been perfectly innocent and within the legal boundaries.

He did accept that he had made calls as alleged by the prosecution and pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.

There was no obscene language or threats of violence.

Mr Marshall-Thomas said: 'He thought that he was having a bit of a joke. It was a joke in poor taste, perhaps a little perverted to say the least. He accepts that.

'He now realises that his behaviour was totally unacceptable.'

He said Lloyd had not tried to get another phone since his arrest and had not made any similar calls since.

Gareth Lloyd was given a 12 month community order and banned from owning a pay-as-you-go mobile phone for one year

He said Lloyd does not have a drink problem but accepted some of the calls were made after he had been drinking.

Mr Marhsall-Thomas said: 'My client apologises profusely for his behaviour.

'He realises now how much worse his behaviour was than he considered at the time.'

Lloyd was the carer for his 84-year-old mother and the court was told it would cause great difficulties if he went to prison.

District judge Andrew Shaw placed him on a 12 month community order and a separate order of 12 months preventing him from using or owning any mobile phone other than a contract phone where his details would be registered.

The judge also ordered him to pay £85 costs and said that although his calls had caused a substantial nuisance, there was no obscene language or threats of violence.
