Warning: Home Secretary Theresa May (above) will make an announcement on stop and search today

Theresa May will today promise to change the law if police do not halt the ‘excessive and inappropriate’ use of stop and search.

The Home Secretary will warn officers that she wants to see a dramatic improvement in figures showing that only one in every ten of the searches ends in arrest.

If police continue to misuse the powers – which are disproportionately targeted against ethnic minorities – legislation will be introduced to tie their hands.

Mrs May will make the announcement when delivering this year’s Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust Criminal Justice Lecture, in memory of the murdered black teenager.

Stop and search has been blamed for inflaming tensions between the police – labelled ‘institutionally racist’ for their botched response to Stephen’s killing – and black people, in particular.

In 2013, a Scotland Yard officer was disciplined for discriminating against Stephen’s younger brother, Stuart, who was followed and stopped while driving in his car.

Mr Lawrence – who said he had been targeted simply because of the colour of his skin - complained that he had been stopped or searched by officers on 25 occasions since the age of 17.

A recent report by the police watchdog found more than a quarter of police stop and searches are ‘unlawful’ and risk promoting ‘major disorder’.

Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary said that, in 27 per cent of cases, police failed to show they had reasonable grounds to carry out the search.

It was the equivalent of 250,000 people every year being stopped and subjected to hugely intrusive searches without the police sticking to the rules.

Mrs May is expected to say that, during her time in office, she has heard ‘accounts exposing the excessive and inappropriate use of stop and search.’

She will add of 'evidence that if you are black or from a minority ethnic background that you are up to seven times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than if you are white’.

Mrs May had originally wanted to legislate to curb the use of the powers in last year’s Queen’s Speech but was blocked by Number 10.

Downing Street was said to be keen to support police leaders who argue the search powers are a vital tool against knife crime and gang culture.

In a compromise, she instead introduced a voluntary code to which every police force, including the British Transport Police, has agreed.

This includes a restriction on the so-called ‘no suspicion’ power, which allows officers to stop and search even when they do not suspect a crime has been committed.

A chief police officer must now believe it is ‘necessary’ to authorise use of the power because violence ‘will’ take place.

Previously, use of the power could be authorised by a much more junior officer if they believed violence ‘may’ occur.

Forces now also have to record the outcome of searches in more detail, including if the suspect was arrested and charged.

Mrs May will tell the conference at London’s City Hall, which is supported by the Mail: ‘It is my hope, expectation and objective that these steps will further reduce the number of stops and searches across England and Wales, as the use of these sensitive powers becomes properly targeted, based on reasonable grounds and accountable to citizens and communities.

‘But let me be absolutely clear: if stops and searches do not continue to fall, if the use of these powers does not become more targeted, and stop-to-arrests ratios do not improve, then a Conservative Government will not hesitate to bring in primary legislation to make it happen.’

Stephen was stabbed to death at the age of 18 in an unprovoked racist attack at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London, in 1993.

The public inquiry into his death accused Scotland Yard of being ‘institutionally racist’.

The Mail campaigned to bring the killers to justice and published a landmark front page accusing five men of the murder.

Two of the men named – Gary Dobson and David Norris – were eventually convicted of murder in 2012.

Last month, the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust and the Daily Mail announced two journalism scholarships. More details can be found by clicking here.
