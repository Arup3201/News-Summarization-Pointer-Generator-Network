Rory McIlroy declared himself happy with his preparations for this week’s Open Championship at Hoylake after bouncing back from a familiar Friday failure in the Scottish Open.

McIlroy continued a trend of following a superb opening round with a terrible second one, shooting a  seven-over-par 78 at Royal Aberdeen just a day after setting a course record of 64.

The 25-year-old responded with a solid 68 on Saturday — with four birdies after dropping a shot at the first — to finish three under par, seven adrift of leaders Justin Rose and Marc Warren.

Despondent: McIlroy followed a course record 64 on day one with six bogeys and a double a day later

Turning it round: Despite his horror day two, McIlroy was upbeat during his third round in Aberdeen

Good response: McIlroy hit a third-round 68 at the Scottish Open to cheer his morale ahead of The Open

‘I’ve shot 64 and 68 on this course, which are two really good scores,’ said the former world No 1. ‘Friday was just one of those days when nothing went right. I couldn’t get any momentum.

‘It would be nice to shoot another good one tomorrow, but I feel good with my game and I saw enough positives in there to give me confidence going into The Open. I played solid golf and didn’t put myself in much trouble. I feel much more prepared going into next week. 

‘Coming in here I was hitting shots into the wind on the range perfectly, but today I hit a couple that weren’t so good.

‘Hitting
 them in practice and hitting them under the gun are two completely 
different things and being able to do that over the past three days and 
tomorrow as well can only help going into next week.

‘It’s
 just about getting rid of these bad stretches of holes or these bad 
second rounds or whatever it is. If I can get rid of that, then there’s 
no reason why I can’t go there next week and really contend.’

Scotsman 
Warren will carry home hopes into the final day as the 33-year-old goes 
in search of his first tour win for seven years.

But
 he will have to erase memories of a horror show at this event two years
 ago when he was leading with four holes to go but blew it.

Warren
 said: ‘I’m in a great position, a very exciting position. For us 
Scottish guys it doesn’t get much better than this. It’s our fifth 
major.

‘Winning’s never easy but I’ve been in this situation before, so once the gun goes I’ll be ready to do my job.’

Tied at the top: Marc Warren leads the Scottish Open with Justin Rose going into the final round
