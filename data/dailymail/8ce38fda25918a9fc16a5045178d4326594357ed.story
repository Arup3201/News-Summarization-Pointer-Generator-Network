It may have been the official residence of British monarchs since 1761, but Buckingham Palace has been a family home too.

As a reminder of this, an exhibition is to offer an unprecedented glimpse into life as a young member of the royal family through well-loved toys, treasured family gifts and childhood outfits.

Among them are a number of the Queen’s favourite playthings including a pink tea set in the shape of a rabbit and a set of skittles known as Knockemdown Ninepins.

Royal Collection Trust Curator Anna Reynolds showcases dolls and a pram belonging to Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace ahead of the Royal Childhood exhibition in April

There is also a wicker pram that a 
two-year-old Princess Elizabeth used to enjoy pushing around the gardens
 of her then home, 145 Piccadilly. She moved to the palace at the age of
 ten.

Her love of anything 
equestrian is reflected in a pair of rocking horses that she and her 
younger sister, Princess Margaret, played with – each sporting a rosette
 bearing the initials of one of the princesses.

Toys
 ranging from jigsaws to train sets are also on display and even a 
wheelbarrow in the shape of a dog which was adored by Princess Margaret,
 who handed it on to her niece, Princess Anne.

Among
 the earliest items to go on display later this year are a dolls house 
for George III’s daughters and dolls made by the young Princess 
Victoria, inspired by characters she had seen at the ballet or opera. 
Although the exhibition, entitled Royal Childhood, spans 250 years, it 
also boasts some more contemporary items such as Prince William’s 
page-boy sailor suit from the wedding of the Duke of York in 1986.

Spanning more than 250 years the exhibition brings together objects from the Royal Collection, the Royal Archives and the private collections of members of the Royal Family, as well as previously unseen photographs and film footage

Royal Childhood, which will showcase tiny beds and toys like these belonging to a young Elizabeth, is part the Summer Opening of the State Rooms at Buckingham Palace from July 26 to September 28

Parisian dolls like these, which Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret used to play with, are to form the centrepiece of a new exhibition that looks back at the objects associated with royal babies and children

The
 silk-satin and lace christening robe worn by Prince George last year, a
 replica of the original Honiton lace robe commissioned by Queen 
Victoria, will also be on display.

Visitors
 will also be able to view for the first time the spectacular 
silver-gilt Lily Font, also commissioned by Victoria for the christening
 of her first daughter, Princess Victoria in 1841, which has been used 
at almost all major royal baptisms since, most recently George’s at the 
Chapel Royal.

Anna Reynolds,
 from the Royal Collection Trust and curator of the exhibition Royal 
Childhood, said: 'From well-loved dolls to rocking horses, rattles and 
outfits, visitors to the palace this summer will see over 100 items that
 span more than 250 years of royal childhood, many of which will go on 
display for the first time.’

The
 exhibition will coincide with the Summer Opening of Buckingham Palace 
from July 26 to September 28. Tickets are available from the Royal 
Collection website.
