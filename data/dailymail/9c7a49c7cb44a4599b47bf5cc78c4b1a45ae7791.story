Sometimes getting a bit of peace and quiet can prove impossible - especially with annoying housemates to contend with, as this new video shows.

Russian YouTube user Vladlena Tkachenko filmed  her giant St. Bernard dog attempting to get a nap as he was licked and sniffed by his tiny kitten friend.

The sleepy canine is seen rolling his eyes in annoyance before stopping the feline in its tracks with his large paw.

The little cat wags its tail as it remains momentarily trapped.

A child watching the scene is heard laughing in the background.

After the kitten manages to wriggle free it sits still, looking a little dazed and confused.

However, it soon goes back to annoying its dog friend, pawing him in the eyes and rubbing up against his face.

At one point the infant animal takes to nibbling the St Bernard's droopy jowls. The canine throws a look of disdain at the camera. 

It appears sometime a bit of peace and quiet can be too much to ask...
