A college student from New York was waiting for UPS to deliver some weightlifting equipment he had ordered - but instead he received a government drone.

The shocking discovery was made Monday by Reddit user Seventy_Seven, who promptly took to the online forum to share photos of what he found inside the UPS parcel.

The box delivered to the engineering student's doorstep contained wings, a control panel and a card stating that the items were federal property and should be returned to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) office at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida.

'I think I just got a drone in the mail.' the unsuspecting recipient wrote in a Reddit post that quickly went viral.

When the student called UPS about the package, he was allegedly told that because his name and address were on the box containing the equipment, the drone was his to keep, if he so chose.

‘In all fairness, the UPS guy that delivered it said it was part 2 of my package, so I genuinely thought at first, that it was part of the weight lifting bench set I ordered,’ the student said. ‘Not sure if that will protect me from the government though.’

Another Reddit user, who described himself as an Afghan war veteran, identified the drone as a Puma AE unmanned aerial vehicle, The Daily Dot reported.

The soldier said the NOAA drone features high-definition thermal camera, a range of nearly 13 miles, and if handled improperly, its rotors could easily cut off a finger.

‘The thing will take a beating!’ the soldier wrote. ‘Don't play chicken with this thing, I've seen one go half way through a car door.’

When fully assembled, a Puma AE unmanned aircraft like the one seen in this picture is worth about $350,000

NOAA 
spokesman David Miller later confirmed that the machinery that was 
mistakenly brought to the home of the college student was indeed a Puma 
drone worth about $350,000 when fully assembled, which had been shipped 
in an eight-box set from Tampa to Stellwagen Bank Marine Sanctuary in 
Massachusetts.

But
 somewhere en route from Florida to Massachusetts, one of the boxes 
containing drone parts allegedly got mislabeled and went missing.

UPS spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg has released a statement confirming the delivery snafu.

She
 added that the shipping company, which delivers nearly 17million 
parcels each day, was working to recover the drone from the Reddit user 
and ship it to the sanctuary as intended.

Rosenberg
 said she suspects a label became displaced from a package ordered by 
the student and wound up on the NOAA box shipped out last Thursday. UPS 
is still investigating exactly what happened to the package.

Seventy_Seven has revealed himself as somewhat of a drone enthusiast, calling them an 'awesome tool.'  He told the Huffington Post that he was
 especially eager to return the unmanned aircraft to NOAA because it was
 meant to be used in the observation of marine life and migratory birds. 

Point of departure: The $350,000 unmanned aircraft was shipped in eight boxes from MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa last week

Mistaken identity: UPS says that the name and address label from a box containing the student's weightlifting bench may have somehow ended up on the box containing the drone

On Tuesday night, UPS staff reportedly picked up the box with the Puma wings and control console, and it is said to be on its way to the Massachusetts nature preserve now. 

According to NOAA, the Puma drone is a ‘flying camera’ that researchers use to ‘spy on nature,’ the Washington Post reported.  

The hand-launched aircraft comes with 5-foot wingspans, a 5-megapixel camera and can fly for two hours at speeds up to 55mph and altitudes up to 10,000 feet, according to Stars and Stripes.

The Reddit user admitted that he should not have posted photos of the drone online before contacting NOAA, and said he was glad the situation was resolved without him being led away in handcuffs, or ‘dead,’ as he wrote half-jokingly in response to other users’ quips.

‘Generally, I was an idiot,’ the student wrote. ‘But I'm a lucky idiot, who currently isn't serving jail time. Even so, I really don't think hypersensitive government equipment would be shipped through UPS, let alone get delivered to a civilian.’
