A Philadelphia model has filed a lawsuit against an Uber driver claiming he punched her in the face and punctured her skin with an earring in a road rage incident over the summer.

Lorraine Delp claims in her suit, filed last week in Philadelphia Civil Court, that at around 3pm on July 17 she was standing in traffic on Sansom Street when Djamel Khelife, a driver with the popular ride-sharing service, came up to her window and started banging on it to get her to move.

Miss Delp states in her complaint that Khelife was hurling profanities at her and spat on her window after she mouthed the words, 'Do not touch my car.'

Road rage brawl: According to the suit, Delp was in her car in Philadelphia July 17 when Uber driver Djamel Khelife came up to her and started banging on her window to get her to move 

According to the fashion model, who also studies horticulture at Barnes Foundation Arboretum School, when she emerged from her vehicle the Uber driver hit her in the face, dislocating her nose.

The blow also allegedly resulted in one of her earrings getting pushed through her skin, leaving a puncture wound on her neck.

The statuesque brunette also claims she suffered bruising, a scratch on her arm and had her shirt ripped.

According to court documents cited by NBC10, a pair of Good Samaritans came to Delp's aid and dragged the 53-year-old driver away from her.

Police were called to the scene and Khelife was arrested on charges of simple assault, aggravated assault and reckless endangerment.

He was released on $6,000 bail the following day and was not formally arraigned until late October.

According to court documents, Khelife’s trial is expected to get under way January 22.

Miss Delp's civil lawsuit names both the driver and Uber, and it seeks more than $500,000 in damages.

Attorney Debra Rainey, who represents Djamel Khelife, has called Delp's claims into question saying that had her client -  6 feet tall and weighing 180lbs - actually attacked the slender model, her injuries would have been far more extensive.

Rainey also pointed out that her client was off duty at the time of the alleged attack.

In response to Daily Mail’s request for comment, an Uber spokesperson said the company cannot discuss active litigation but pointed out that ‘safety is Uber's top priority and we're committed to maintaining the highest level of safety and quality for riders and drivers.’

Only last week, Uber's head of global safety unveiled plans to introduce new ways to screen would-be drivers.

The ride-sharing company came under intense scrutiny after an Uber driver in Massachusetts was arraigned on charges including rape and kidnapping of a female passenger.

'We are finding solutions in many places that range from polygraph exams that fill gaps in available data to adding our own processes on top of existing screening for commercial licenses,' wrote company security chief Philip Cardenas in a blog post last Wednesday.
