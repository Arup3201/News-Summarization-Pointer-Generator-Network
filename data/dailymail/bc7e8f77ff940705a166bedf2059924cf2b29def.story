Nicola Sturgeon is behaving like Vladimir Putin by 'stoking division in England', a senior Tory warns.

In a provocative intervention, Ben Wallace last night accused Scotland's First Minister of trying to break up Britain using the same tactics as the Russian president in the early days of the Ukraine crisis.

Miss Sturgeon will use her keynote speech at the SNP's conference in Glasgow today to insist that she will 'demand an end to slash and burn austerity' in return for propping up Ed Miliband in Downing Street.

She will claim to be sending a 'message of friendship and solidarity' to English voters who want an end to spending cuts that 'tear at the very fabric of society'.

But Mr Wallace, a serving government whip who was once a Member of the Scottish Parliament, last night accused her of masterminding a plot designed to anger English voters and hasten the break-up of the UK.

'Nicola Sturgeon is intent on stoking division in England in the same way Putin used it to break apart Ukraine,' he said. 'I'm talking about the early days in the Ukraine crisis, before the tanks, when he spread division and fear in order for it to splinter apart.

'Separatists all over the world use division and nationalism to break up countries. Sturgeon may dress it up as friendliness, but that is what she wants – she wants England to tell the Scots to get lost.

'Labour could stop this if Miliband said he would not proceed with legislation... that could not get through without SNP votes. But if Labour's greed for power allows her to succeed, then God help the UK.'

Miss Sturgeon has previously provoked anger by saying she would 'lock the Tories out' of Downing Street in the event of a hung parliament – even if they win the most seats.

She said she would have no qualms about installing Mr Miliband in No 10, despite believing that Scotland should not even be part of the UK. But she warned she would push for 'an end to austerity and the non-renewal of Trident' in return.

Treasury figures show the SNP's plans would involve an extra £148billion of spending – leading to higher borrowing and taxes. However polls predict the party could win more than 50 of Scotland's 59 seats at the election – and could potentially prop up a minority Labour government.

Miss Sturgeon will claim today that her party's Left-wing stance appeals to millions of voters in England. She will tell activists: 'To ordinary people across these islands who feel just as let down by the out of touch Westminster system as we do, I have a very clear message.

'It is a message of friendship and solidarity. As long as Scotland remains part of the Westminster system, we will be your allies in seeking to reform that outdated system.

'So to people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, I make this promise. The SNP stands ready to work with you. We will demand an alternative to slash and burn austerity.'

Former Tory defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth accused Miss Sturgeon of 'arrogance' for boasting that she could hand power to Labour even if it loses the election.

He said: 'We have had the Scottish referendum, which she lost, and now she wants to dictate policy to England – what arrogance. The SNP has demonstrated that it is deeply socialist – far worse even than Labour.'

He said it would be 'catastrophic' for the UK if the SNP held the balance of power, as it would lead to 'more spending and borrowing, higher taxes and weaker defences'.

Fellow Tory Michael Ellis said Labour appeared to have been 'taken hostage' by the SNP. 'It is quite clear that Alex Salmond will ride roughshod over Miliband and hold him to ransom for a very high price.'
