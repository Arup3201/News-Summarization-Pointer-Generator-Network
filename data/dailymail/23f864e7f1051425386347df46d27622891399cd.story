'Bizarre': Omar Ali, 23, offered takeaway staff a gun as payment for a fish and chips meal

A 23-year-old man who tried to pay for his fish and chips dinner with a gun has been jailed for seven months.

Omar Ali did not threaten the staff at the Podsmead fish and chip shop in Gloucester with the imitation firearm - but instead offered it as payment for the meal.

When staff refused to accept the gun as payment, Ali tried to exchange it at another store before he was arrested by police.

Prosecutor Julian Kesner told the court: ‘This is a strange matter.

‘He went into the Podsmead fish and chip shop and appeared to want to exchange a gun for money. He effectively wanted to swap it.’

Gloucester Crown Court heard staff refused the gun and Ali left to try his luck elsewhere.

‘Later that evening, at 7pm, he went into the Premier Convenience Store and asked for alcohol on credit. He was refused.

‘He went back to the till and showed his waistband. In the waistband there appeared to be a handgun.

‘He leaned over the counter and put the gun on the shelf under the till and offered it in payment.

‘The cashier picked up the gun and put it on the counter. The defendant picked it up and put it back in his waistband.

‘When he was arrested two imitation handguns were found in his home.’

Ali was also charged with assaulting his girlfriend, Miss Boon, in a separate incident.

Mr Kesner said Ali had been drinking all day when his girlfriend told him she was going out to see a friend.

The court heard Ali told her 'You're not going out' and he scuffled with her, causing her to fall to the floor.

Mr Kesner said: 'She put her arm up and he bit it, leaving marks on her arm.

'She says he then produced a knife 
and held it in front of her, threatening to stab her unless she went and
sat back down. She was screaming and a neighbour called the police.'

Ali, of Byron Avenue, Podsmead, 
Gloucester, admitted charges of possessing an imitation firearm, common 
assault on his partner in a separate incident, and motoring offences 
including having no insurance and failing to stop after an accident.

Jailing him, Judge William Hart 
described the case as bizarre story but accepted that Ali was trying to 
give the weapon to shop staff as payment.

And
while the gun was extremely authentic in appearance, Judge Hart told 
the court it was not actually capable of causing real harm.

He added: ‘However, although there are no aggravating features there must be an immediate prison term, albeit a short one.

‘It
is important that everyone realises that any possession of even an 
imitation firearm in a public place - especially one as authentic 
looking as this - requires custody.’

Judge
Hart jailed Ali for five months for possession of the imitation gun and
two months consecutively for assaulting his partner Rachel Boon, who is
profoundly deaf. The judge ordered six points on Ali’s driving licence 
for his motoring offences.

Steve Young, defending, described it as an ‘extremely unusual case.’

He
continued: ‘There was no danger of this gun falling into criminal 
hands. In fact he was trying to dispose of it to respectable people.’
