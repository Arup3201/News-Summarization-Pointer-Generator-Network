Samsung has announced yet another handset in its Galaxy range of smartphones aimed at buyers on a budget.

The Galaxy Core Advance is a marginally improved version of the Galaxy Core, which the Korean firm launched in June, and the Galaxy Core Plus that launched in Taiwan in October.

It has the same 8GB basic storage as the Core, as well as the same camera, but comes with a slightly larger 4.7-inch screen.

Samsung hasn't announced pricing for its budget Galaxy Core Advance, pictured, yet but based on its lower-end features such as 8GB storage, 5MP camera and 1.2Ghz processor, the phone is expected to cost around £150 when it launches 'early next year'

Dimensions: 133.3 x 70.5 x 9.7mm

Weight: 145g

Display: 4.7-inch

Memory: 1GB RAM plus 8GB storage that can be extended up to 64GB using microSD 

Processor: Dual Core 1.2 GHz

Camera: 5MP 

Battery: 2,000 mAh

Operating system: Android 4.2 Jelly Bean

Colours: Deep Blue and Pearl White

Both the Galaxy Core and the Galaxy Core Plus have 4.3-inch displays.

The Core Advance is due to launch 'early next year' but Samsung has not yet announced pricing or carrier information.

However, based on its specifications and the prices of the Core in the UK, the Core Advance is expected to retail at between £150 and £170.

By comparison, the high-end Samsung Galaxy S4 costs around £350.

The Core Advance will also need to stay around this price point to rival the £135 Moto G unveiled last month.

Samsung's Galaxy Core Advance weighs 145g - the original Core is 124g - and has a 2,000 mAh battery, compared to the Core's 1,800 mAH.

The Galaxy Core Advance, pictured, is a marginally improved version of the Galaxy Core, which the Korean firm launched in June. It has a larger 4.7-inch display and improved battery, but the operating system, built-in storage and cameras are the same. The Galaxy Core costs around £150

The Core Advance additionally has two extra keys on the front of the device, pictured, for 'users who are less comfortable with a touchscreen experience'

They both run Android Jelly Bean, both have 1.2 GHz processors and both feature 5MP rear-facing cameras.

In addition, both handsets have VGA front-facing cameras, which means the quality of the camera is less than 1MP.

The Core Advance does have two extra physical keys on the front of the device for ‘users who are less comfortable with a touchscreen experience’, according to Samsung’s official release.

Elsewhere, it comes with a range of built-in apps and features including S Translator, Sound and Shot, which lets users add sounds to photos, and Group Play, that lets users stream music across multiple devices.

The Core Advance will be available in Deep Blue and Pearl White.

By comparison, the Moto G screen has 4.5-inch display and comes in 8GB and 16GB models.

It has a 5MP rear-facing camera and a 1.3MP camera on the front of the device. The handset is available in seven different colours, including red, pink, yellow and blue, and the colourful cases are interchangeable.
