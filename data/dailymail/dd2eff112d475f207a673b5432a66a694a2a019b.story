A paedophile who escaped jail after his 13-year-old victim was called 'predatory' in court will have his sentenced reviewed by the Court of Appeal.

Neil Wilson sparked outrage when he was handed a suspended sentence despite pleading guilty to engaging in sexual activity with a child, making indecent images of a child and possession of an extreme pornographic image.

Now the Attorney General has opted to refer the case to appeal judges who will decide whether the original sentence was unduly lenient.

Review: A paedophile who escaped prison will have his sentence re-examined at the Court of Appeal

Wilson, 41, was given a 12-month suspended sentence after prosecuting barrister Robert Colover labelled his victims 'predatory' and 'sexually experienced'.

Judge Nigel Peters QC also said he had accounted for the fact that the girl looked older than 13 when he sentenced Wilson.

'Having carefully reviewed this case, the Attorney General, Dominic Grieve QC MP, has decided to refer the sentence of Neil Wilson to the Court of Appeal for review,' the Attorney General's Office said in a statement.

'The case will in due course be heard by three Court of Appeal judges who will decide whether or not the sentence is unduly lenient and whether they should increase it.'

Controversy: Attorney General Dominic Grieve, left, made the decision after barrister Robert Colover, right, sparked an outcry by describing the man's victim as 'predatory'

Mr Colover has been suspended from prosecuting sexual offence cases pending a review by the Crown Prosecution Service, while Mr Peters' comments are to be investigated by the Office for Judicial Complaints.

Following the outcry over Mr Colover's comments, 50,000 people signed a petition demanding that the Director of Public Prosecutions investigate the lawyer's language.

Uproar: Judge Nigel Peters imposed a more lenient sentence because the 13-year-old girl looked older

Even David Cameron got involved in 
the controversy, saying: 'We need a criminal justice system that stands 
up properly for victims. The victims of crime should always be at the 
centre of our thinking.'

Wilson admitted to picking up the girl in the street in Romford, Essex while she was playing truant from school.

He took her back to his flat and started a two-week 'fling' with her, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard, culminating in a sexual encounter apparently initiated by the girl.

When officers went to Wilson's home after the girl told a friend about the incident, they found images of child sexual abuse and videos depicting bestiality on his computer.

During sentencing, Mr Colover said: 'The girl is predatory in all her actions and she is sexually experienced.

'She appeared to look around 14 or 15 and had the mental age of a 14 or 15 year old despite being younger than that.

'There was sexual activity but it was not of Mr Wilson's doing, you might say it was forced upon him despite being older and stronger than her.'

The judge apparently agreed, telling Wilson: 'I have taken in to account that even though the girl was 13, the prosecution say she looked and behaved a little bit older.

'You knew she was not nearly 16 as she said and your plea of guilty recognises that you knew.

'Allowing her to visit your home is something we have to clamp down on and in normal circumstances that would mean a significant term in prison.

'On these facts, the girl was predatory and was egging you on. That is no defence when dealing with children but I am prepared to impose a suspension.'
