Town halls are to be shamed into bringing back weekly bin collections, it was revealed yesterday.

In a victory for householders and the Daily Mail, ministers unveiled a £250million fund to restore them.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said councils will now have ‘no excuse’ to maintain hugely unpopular fortnightly schemes. ‘My view has always been that people expect a weekly collection,’ he said.

STEVE DOUGHTY: Don't you wish you had a truth drug you could introduce into the water coolers at your nearest palace of local government?

If

questions to the council on the subject of the day, the bins.

‘For most people, the only visible service that they get from the council is the removal of refuse.

‘Middle England has been squeezed. It’s time to understand there’s a limit to what Middle England will take.’

He cannot force town halls to go back to weekly collections, but made it clear that voters should throw out councils which do not – a provocative suggestion, given that many of those that have gone fortnightly are Conservative controlled.

Mr Pickles told the Daily Mail: ‘I’ve had council leaders sitting at this very table who claim their public like a fortnightly collection and are very supportive. Well, good luck to them. Come the elections, there can be no excuses.’

The announcement is a major victory for the Mail's 'great bin revolt campaign', which has highlighted the problems associated with fortnightly collections

problems associated with the shift to fortnightly collections.

Local authorities will have to guarantee weekly bin rounds for the next five years to qualify for the funding.

Once-a-week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875 and were maintained until after Labour’s 1997 election victory, when local authorities were encouraged to collect household waste and recyclable rubbish on alternate weeks.

Householders quickly began to complain about increases in rats and other pests, unpleasant smells from food waste left uncollected for up to a fortnight, and a plethora of bin fines and taxes imposed on those who broke the rules.

Now at least half the homes in Britain have lost their weekly collections of general rubbish.

Mr Pickles said it was quite possible to increase recycling rates while also offering weekly collections of all rubbish.

He hailed the example of Windsor and Maidenhead, which has increased recycling by 35 per cent by offering households incentives such as shopping vouchers or loyalty card points.

Mr Pickles said councils could use 
the new cash to introduce innovative technology such as facilities which
sort rubbish into recyclable items and those that need to go to 
landfill. ‘My aim has always been to pass the chicken tikka masala test,
so the nation’s favourite meal can be consumed on Friday night safe 
from the worry that two weeks later its remains will still be rotting in
the bottom of the bin,’ he said.

‘I also want an end to bin blight, where rows of bins run the risk of obscuring a small bungalow.

‘Labour’s solution was to bully councils into fortnightly collections. My view is this goes beyond bins – it’s about a question of trust between politicians and the public.

‘The truth is that it’s possible to protect and enhance the environment and encourage people to do the right thing, while also adopting a sensible approach to dealing with waste.’

The Local Government  Secretary’s announcement follows a battle between him and Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman, who tried to ditch a Tory election pledge to restore traditional weekly collections.

Mr Pickles insisted that Mrs Spelman – with whom he is said to have fallen out so badly that they stopped speaking for a period – was fully on side.

‘Defra should be very pleased. Both Caroline and I campaigned for this in opposition and we are now delivering that in government,’ he said.

Mr Pickles said the cash for the scheme was coming from within his department, even after spending cuts have been made.

Doretta Cocks, founder of the Campaign for Weekly Waste, said: ‘I am extremely pleased that this funding has been made available and our members will be absolutely delighted.’

Matthew Elliott of the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘Rubbish collection may not be seen as a sexy issue to the chattering classes in London, but it is of great concern to ordinary hardworking taxpayers.

‘Woe betide the councils who do not reinstate weekly bin collections or who persist with plans to scrap this basic service, causing misery to residents.’
