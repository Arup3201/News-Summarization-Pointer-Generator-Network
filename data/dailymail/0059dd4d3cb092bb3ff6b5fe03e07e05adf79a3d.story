The grieving father of a schoolgirl who was tragically killed when she was hit by a car has told of how he brought his family to Australia from India in order to give them a better life.

Aneri Patel, 16, was walking along the main street in Kogarah in Sydney's south on Monday morning when she was struck by a 4WD driven by an unlicensed driver. 

Now her father, Nikul Patel, has made a desperate plea for justice, Nine News report.

'We want the justice so she can rest in peace wherever she is,' Mr Patel said.

Nikul Patel, the father of Aneri who was killed when she was hit by a car in Kogarah on Monday has broken his silence pleading for justice

He said he moved from his home country to offer his only child a better life, and now he and his wife are left with nothing.

'What I am getting in the end of that? Nothing. For me it's a zero we don't have any more life for us.'

Mr Patel  believes the tragedy could have been avoided had the road been made safer after another woman, Emma Hansen, was killed at the same intersection seven years ago.

He also expressed his outrage over his daughter's alleged killer being unlicensed. 

'My daughter had her licence and was walking on the footpath, and that lady she didn't have any licence and she was driving. So what is the law here?,' Mr Patel said.

Mr Patel said he and his wife (right) came from India to provide a better life for their daughter 

On hearing the news that the driver had walked free on bail Aneri's father couldn't contain his disbelief.

The schoolgirl's grandfather said the family were devastated by the loss of Aneri and want justice for their young family member's death.

'Unexplainable, no words are there to explain the things... Only we require justice', J.C Patel said. 

A friend of the family - Bill Saini - also expressed the grief Aneri's parents were experiencing.

'They have only one child, they have lost everything, lost everything. Something has to be done very quickly otherwise it can happen any moment again' - he said.

Attorney General Bras Hazzard has asked for a review of the decision to grant the driver bail, and said it needs to be determined whether the decision to grant bail was 'appropriate', The Daily Telegraph report.

'I have asked the Director Of Public Prosecution to look closely at what has happened', he said. 

The newspaper also reported Puipuiomaota Galuvao, the driver who allegedly killed Aneri, was only behind the wheel as her friend Heidi Watson had just had her license suspended at Kogarah Courthouse.

Earlier this week friends of the 16-year-old schoolgirl took to social media to pay tribute to the teenager. 

Friends of the year 11 student  flooded social media not only with memories of Ms Patel, but also with a plea to drivers.

One classmate simply wrote: 'Aneri, I hope you find peace where you are going,' while another remembered her as a peaceful and quiet girl,' The Daily Telegraph report.

The female driver of the vehicle which struck Ms Patel was unlicensed and has been charged by police. 

The 26-year-old will face Kogarah Local Court on October 14 on charges including dangerous driving occasioning death and negligent driving occasioning death. 

Friends have paid tribute to Aneri Patel, 16, who was killed on Monday morning when a car smashed into a chemist in Sydney's south 

Other friends and family of the victim took the opportunity to convey a serious message to those on the roads.

'Please take this as a caution to drive safely as you could hold someone’s life in your hand,' one student wrote.

'RIP to Aneri, a great friend to many. God bless her family and provide them with strength and support through this tragic time. You will always be ­remembered in our hearts,' they also posted. 

The female driver was taken to St George Hospital suffering shock after the crash at 11.30 am, police told Daily Mail Australia on Monday. 

The  unlicensed 26-year-old woman was arrested on Monday night and was being questioned by police. She will also undergo mandatory testing.
