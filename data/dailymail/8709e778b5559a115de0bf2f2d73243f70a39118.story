A man born with a medical condition which causes huge folds of skin to hang down over his face is celebrating becoming the proud father of a healthy baby girl.

Latif Khatana, 32, who has been dubbed the Man With No Face, suffered years of abuse over his disability and was terrified his unborn child would inherit the same condition.

But he and wife Salima, 25, from Jammu and Kashmir in the Indian Himalayas have been able to enjoy every moment with newborn daughter Ulfat after she was given a clean bill of health.

Baby joy: Latif Khatana, who suffers from an extreme skin condition, and wife Salima, with their healthy newborn daughter Ulfat

Ulfat, whose name means love in Urdu, was born naturally at home in Reasi district, on November 10th, weighing a healthy 5lbs 5oz, with the help of female relatives and a midwife.

As soon as Latif held his new daughter he quickly checked her over for any visible marks. But the new parents were overjoyed to find their little girl was healthy and unmarked.

Latif suffers from the skin disorder, 
Neurofibromatosis, which causes multiple flaps of skin to cover 
his entire face, imparing his vision and effectively making him almost faceless.

He said: ‘I was extremely worried about my baby’s facial features. When I saw that she was pretty and fine, it was a great relief. She has a fair and beautiful face, just like an angel.’

Latif explained his new daughter has brought joy into his life after years of misery because of his own facial features.

He said: ‘I want to forget about my past life. Being a father is a new chapter in a man's life and I am embracing every second of it. I will enjoy it and I’ll now be a lot more worried about her than myself. I don’t care so much about me anymore.’

When his wife Salima found out she was expecting, the pair suffered many sleepless nights worried whether Latif would pass on his condition.

Salima, who was born with just one foot, married Latif in August 2008. Latif struggled to find a wife for many years but when he met Salima, they bonded over their disabilities, and finally agreed to marry.

Latif said: ‘We had always wanted children but we were always too scared. In the end we took a chance but I prayed throughout the pregnancy that we had a healthy child. I didn’t care if it was a boy or girl as long as he or she didn’t have to hide its face in shame.

‘When I finally heard my daughter’s cries, it was such a special moment, my heart was full of happiness.’

Even though Latif cannot see enough to get involved fully in his parenting duties he has been helping where he can.

He said: ‘I can't see properly, so I can’t do much to help my wife. My wife is much more organised anyway, she knows how to handle a baby.

'Fathers are not trained but I do what I can. I sometimes hold her while my wife is in the kitchen or doing other work.”

Latif and Salima would like more children, but their financial problems might not allow it. ‘I thank god for blessing me with a beautiful daughter and we’d love more children.

'But I don’t earn enough. No parent would want their child to suffer any health problems, but they do not want them to suffer financially either.’

Latif has taken to begging to support his family. His condition has meant he can’t see properly so is unable to secure a job. He travels to Kashmir's capital city, Srinagar, every year for several months to make enough money to send home.

‘I don’t want to leave my daughter but I don’t have much choice and I will have to leave in the Spring. I have to earn money to support my family and this is the only way I can make any,’ he added.

Salima said Latif has been a wonderful husband and believes he will go on to make a great father.

‘We were worried for a long time about what our children would look like but now I’m sure all our children will be healthy,’ she added.

‘No matter what Latif looks like, I love being married to him. I don’t regret one day as his wife. I like him just the way he is. His face is god’s wish, we can't do much with it so we accept it and live our lives.

'But thankfully it was not the same wish for our daughter. Our prayers were answered and our baby is fine. We refuse to waste another minute worrying about it now. We will live our lives, happily.’

In its mild form the condition typically causes harmless coffee-coloured patches on the skin

Neurofibromatosis is the name for a group of conditions that cause lumps to grow on the coverings of nerves.

There are two main types - the most common being Type 1 or NF1. This affects around one person in 2,500. There is no known cure.

NF is caused by a mutation in one of the genes. About half of the people who have it have no family history of the condition. This is called a spontaneous gene mutation.

The other half of people will have inherited NF from their mother or father. It often lays dormant until adulthood.

Symptoms can vary from one person to another even in the same family.

Some people have a very mild form and may not realise they have it – developing six or more harmless coffee-coloured patches on the skin.

However, other sufferers are affected by neurofibromas, which usually appear during adolescence. These may first appear on the skin as a purplish mark, before a small fibrous lump appears.

They can also grow along deeper-seated nerves inside the body, which can be painful if knocked.

The lumps can increase in number during a person’s lifetime. There is no treatment to stop the lumps from appearing  although surgery or laser treatment can sometimes be used to remove them.

Richard Taylor, chairman of the Neuro Foundation said: 'NF1 is a debilitating genetic illness that causes benign tumours to grow in 25,000 patients in the UK.

'The condition often leads to social isolation as many people simply do not understand or appreciate the condition.'
