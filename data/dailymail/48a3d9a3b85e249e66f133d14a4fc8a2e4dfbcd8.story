The United Kingdom could be broken up on the basis of Labour voters rushing to back independence, 15 years after Tony Blair set the country on the road to devolution.

The former Prime Minister has been conspicuous by his absence from the referendum campaign trail, despite being born in Edinburgh.

But senior Tories blame him for failing to predict the rise of nationalism, and say the battle to save the Union will be won or lost in what used to be rock solid Labour areas.

Blame: Conservatives say Tony Blair paved the way for the rise of the SNP and the independence movement

Campaign: Independence supporters have put a big Yes sign on the hills overlooking Edinburgh

It was the New Labour landslide in 1997 which swept the Conservatives out of Scotland and paved the way for the rise of Alex Salmond’s SNP.

Mr Blair supported devolution, which was overwhelmingly backed by Scots in a referendum.

The Scottish Parliament then opened in 1999, to the obvious delight of Mr Salmond who said it was a major step on the road to total separation.

In the 2011 elections to the Scottish Parliament, the SNP secured a surprise overall majority, with Mr Salmond declaring he had a mandate for a referendum on independence which could not be ignored by Westminster.

Mr Blair has avoided campaigning for a No vote as he knows he remains a divisive character north of the border in the wake of the Iraq War.

In his autobiography, the former Labour leader claimed he was to blame for the party's humiliating defeat by the SNP in 2007, and the Nationalists have repeatedly described him as 'toxic'.

But many of those now battling to save the 307-year-old Union in the final hours of the campaign say Mr Blair must shoulder the blame.

Former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major has blamed Labour for the growing threat of Scottish independence – claiming the party had spent years attacking the Conservatives and Westminster.

Sir John said Labour and the SNP ‘have fed a divisive narrative that has bitten deep, ignoring the revolution in Scottish living standards brought about, in large part, by Conservative policies’.

He added in an article in The Times last week: ‘It would be ironic indeed if Scotland voted for separation, and Labour lost all its significant representation in the House of Commons. If this comes to pass, no one should weep for them.’

A new Survation opinion poll for the Mail shows that the race is still too close to call.

The headline results show that 44.1 per cent of Scots plan to back independence, up from 42.4 per cent in a comparable poll from last week.

Support for a No vote remains virtually static at 47.7 per cent, with 8.3 per cent undecided. Overall, this points to a final result of 52 per cent No and 48 per cent Yes.

But alarmingly for the No camp, the poll indicates a shift back to Yes among Labour voters, who may decide the outcome.

While 91 per cent of those who voted Conservative in the 2011 Holyrood elections are backing No, just 60 per cent of Labour voters plan to do the same.

Labour’s big beasts like Gordon Brown and John Reid have been deployed to try to win back their supporters to the No cause.

But Mr Blair’s only recent intervention has been during a speech in Ukraine.

He said: 'Obviously I hope that Scotland votes to stay part of the United Kingdom.'

Speaking at a security conference in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev at the weekend, he added: 'To rip up the alliance between our countries would not be sensible, politically, economically or even emotionally.'

Born in Edinburgh, Mr Blair went to school in Durham before returning to Scotland to attend Edinburgh's Fettes College. His father was born in Yorkshire but grew up in Glasgow.

In his final speech to a Scottish Labour conference in Oban in 2006, he famously said: 'I detest this narrow nationalism not because it engenders fear but because it squanders hope.'

Ex-Chancellor Alistair Darling, leader of Better Together, has previously called for his former boss to play his part in a 'call to arms' to keep the UK together.

But Mr Blair has been reluctant to speak out, in stark contrast with his successor, Gordon Brown, who has returned to frontline politics to fight for the Union.

Downing Street insists there is little David Cameron can do to persuade more people to the No cause.

’There is a massive Labour effort on the ground,’ said a source.

’We are leaving the field open to Labour. Almost all Tories are voting No. There is literally nothing more we can do.

’Labour have got to swamp the area.’
