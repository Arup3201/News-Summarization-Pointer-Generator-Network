A defiant dad-of-seven has responded to local officials who demanded he painted his house - by covering it in stars and stripes.

Brent Greer, 43, was angry when a code enforcement officer visited his home in Bradenton, Florida after someone complained that he had left an old Christmas tree on a balcony - and slapped him with even more complaints.

Among the gripes were missing window screens, peeling paint and the need for pressure washing, the Bradenton Herald reported.

But Greer, a married foster dad whose seven children are all adopted, said he has more things to worry about than minor alterations - especially because the house is safe for his large brood.

Proud: Brent Greer reacted to local officials' complaints about the upkeep of his family's home by painting it red, white and blue. The neighbors have supported the home's new look - which Greer said is staying

Fight: Greer inherited the 100-year-old home and said he should be able to do with it what he pleases

So he decided to stand up for his family and together, they slathered the house in the most eye-catching way they could imagine - one that comes with a message.

'I want to remind people this is America,' he told Bay News 9. 'This is the home of the free, and I'm not changing because I have some zoning ordinance that doesn’t like the way I express myself.'

Next they plan to put a Liberty Bell on the second floor and the Statue of Liberty on the chimney.

Greer, who grew up in the 100-year-old home, said the trouble first began when code enforcement officers responded to an anonymous tip about the Christmas tree a few months ago.

In addition, some neighbors had complained about his 'tacky' holiday decorations.

'We
 got our oldest daughter when she was 10,' Greer told the Bradenton Herald. 'She had been 
homeless all her life and never even knew what a Christmas tree was. So 
yeah, I go all out with Christmas trees and other decorations for that 
very reason.'

Support: Mr Greer, who has adopted seven children with his wife, said they have more to worry about than cosmetic problems with their home. He said the house is a safe place for his children to live

Before: Ahead of the paintwork, anonymous neighbors had complained that he still had a Christmas tree up on a balcony, and city officials complained that the house needed aesthetic updates

After: He said he has carried out most of the updates on his home but officials will check later this month

Volker Reiss, Community Services and Code Compliance Manager for City of Bradenton, said that his staff asked the family to remove the tree and they did.

But then, the family were slapped with as many as nine other violations.

'He sent out a list of all these things and I was like, "Are you kidding me?"' Greer said, adding that he was most annoyed by a complaint that the paint on the outside of the house was not up to standard.

'This is a house where a family lives and plays,' he said.

Officials insisted that the issue was more than just cosmetic.

'We had a safety concern about 
electrical,' they told WTSP. 'It seemed the wires weren't up to code. The balcony had 
rotten wood, some concerns, but the home is livable.'

Greer was told if he fix his house in accordance to the standards, he would be fined $250 a day.

Inspiration? Greer's wife previously shared an image of this house on Facebook saying she loved that it reminded her that she was American

He added that he has now complied with most of the complaints and will work on others - but the color of the house is staying.

'I'm not going to paint over it,' he said. 'I like it.'

Neighbors agreed that they also liked it, as well as the family's defiance.

'I think it's one of the best things in the neighborhood,' Chris Grumley told WSPA as he stopped to look. 'My family and I are British. We’re not transplanted Brits. We 
live the American life, and it's people like this displaying their true 
patriotism that makes us proud to be here.'

The city will inspect the home again on June 16 and if he has not met the standard, Greer will appear at a hearing the following day.
