Controversial 'pick-up artist' Julien Blanc has issued a public apology for his offensive 'tips' after being called the 'most hated man in the world'.

The 25-year-old Californian, who had his Australian visa cancelled by Immigration Minister Scott Morrison and is now facing bans from entering the UK, issued an apology during an interview on CNN.

'I just want to apologise to anybody that I have offended in any way. It was never my intention and I just want to put it out that I'm extremely sorry for everything that happened,' Blanc told CNN presenter Chris Cuomo.

Californian 'pick-up artist' Julien Blanc issued a public apology for his offensive 'tips' during an interview

Guru: Mr Blanc (pictured in a Twitter photo) runs $3,000-a-head 'dating seminars' for men across the world

Blanc, whose infamous tips for unconfident men trying to socialise with women included choking them and forcing their faces into his crutch, went on to say: 'my intentions weren't ever bad'.

'That is not what I teach,' he said when confronted by pictures of him choking women.

'Those pictures there were a horrible, horrible attempt at humour and they were also taken out of context.'

When questioned about a manipulated women's abuse chart that he posted to his Twitter page and called a 'checklist' for 'making her stay', Blanc again denied that it had anything to do with his teachings.

The 25-year-old claimed that his teachings do not direct men to choke women and force their heads into their crotches 

He said that a photograph of him choking a woman (pictured) was a 'a horrible, horrible attempt at humour'

'I thought mocking it would be funny but it wasn't and I regret putting that out,' he said.

However, throughout the interview, Blanc's interviewer questioned him relentlessly and appeared unimpressed as he claimed his photos were 'taken out of context' and that 'you can make anything look bad in a picture'.

The sentiments were echoed across social media where furious opponents of Blanc's teachings slammed the Californian for denying that he gave out the controversial advice.

He also claimed that a chart that was posted to his Twitter account (pictured) that was originally designed to help women identify when they are being abused but was altered and called a 'checklist' for 'making her stay', was not part of his teachings 

Jennifer Li, the founder of the original campaign against Blanc titled #TakeDownJulienBlanc, told Buzzfeed, 'he is sorry he got caught, not for what he has done.

'How can you say you do not teach this when the video shows him telling men that it's ok to force women's heads on his crotch?'

Twitter user Polly Maeve agreed, writing: 'Sorry for causing offence IS NOT being sorry for, or taking ownership of, your actions.'

An anonymous blogger who runs the website Tinders Finest Bachelors, and claims to have been verbally abused by Blanc on the dating app, has also dismissed his public apology.

The blogger posted her alleged conversation with Blanc, in which he begged her for sex before writing 'you should be happy I'm acknowledging your existence you w****', on her popular Tumblr page.

Twitter users slammed Blanc's apology, for denying that he gave out the controversial advice

'There are hours of seminar footage where Julien encourages and instructs men to objectify and manipulate women,' she told BuzzFeed.

'There is video of him saying that when he takes something too far, he'll "save" the situation by saying "just kidding".' 

Dozens of petitions continue to appear online demanding that Blanc be refused entry into various countries including the UK, Japan and Belgium.
