A third former teacher at Chetham's School of Music was today being investigated over sexual allegations against his former pupils, after ten women came forward to claim they were abused.

Violin teacher Chris Ling, 55, who now lives in Los Angeles, California, allegedly inappropriately touched teenage girls and asked them to play naked for him, some of the women told a newspaper.

One former pupil at the prestigious music school in Manchester claimed to the Guardian that Mr Ling spanked her bare bottom when she made a mistake, while another said he massaged her breasts.

The allegations come after Michael Brewer, 68, was convicted on Friday of sexually abusing Frances Andrade, 48, who killed herself after giving evidence against her former music teacher at the school.

Brewer's ex-wife Kay, 68, was also found guilty of indecently assaulting the mother of four when she was 18. Mrs Andrade’s body was found at her home one week after she gave evidence last month.

A five-month investigation was launched into Mr Ling in 1990 by Greater Manchester Police, which was passed onto the Director of Public Prosecutions - but it was dropped for unknown reasons.

The force told the Guardian on Friday that it had not yet found the relevant files to establish why the probe was closed, but a source confirmed to MailOnline today that the force is investigating allegations concerning Mr Ling.

Greater Manchester Police said some women had come to them with allegations about Chetham's and it will be working very closely with the school, reported ITV News.

The force added that it had been provided with a list of potential victims by a newspaper, but they have not yet been formally interviewed, and the investigation is at a very early stage.

Chief Superintendent Russ Jackson said: ‘Following the conclusion of the trial last week there has been substantial press coverage and comment.

‘Greater Manchester Police has since been provided with a list of potential victims from a newspaper. In addition to this, several people have also come forward directly to police.

‘Reporting sexual abuse which occurred some time ago is an incredibly difficult thing to do, so we will be affording them, and anyone else who comes forward, all the appropriate time and support to discuss events in their own time.

‘We will be working very closely with the school in the coming weeks and months but I must stress this investigation is at a very early stage.

‘We have specially trained officers on hand to deal with any complaints sensitively and expeditiously and I would encourage any victim of sexual abuse regardless of when or where the offence occurred to call us.’

Last week, the current headteacher of Chetham's, Claire Moreland, said the revelations of Brewer's impropriety had ‘shocked us to the core’.

Mr Ling’s lawyer told The People newspaper in March 1991 when it reported on claims against him: ‘More credence could be attached to rumours that Saddam Hussein has won the Nobel peace prize.’

Response to allegations in 1991 by Chris Ling's lawyer

An ex-student who once travelled with him to the U.S. also dampened the claims in 1991, saying: ‘Mr Ling is a wonderful teacher. I know what people are saying I don’t believe a word if it.’

MailOnline has approached Mr Ling for comment at his home in the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles, but nobody answered the door.

A spokesman for Chetham's said: 'The police are now investigating the allegations of abuse at the school in the 1980s which have been the subject of recent newspaper reports. We will be assisting the police in whatever way we can.

'While this investigation is ongoing it would not be appropriate for the school to comment any further, save to say that we encourage anyone who has any relevant information to contact Greater Manchester Police on 101, or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.'

Meanwhile, last night an academic who 
was also a pupil at Chetham’s around the same time as Mrs Andrade, 
called for a wider inquiry into sexual abuse at music schools in the 
Seventies and Eighties.

Ian Pace, a pianist and musicologist who 
lectures at City University in Islington, central London, said the world of classical music
was controlled by just a few influential people.

He said: ‘It is well known within the music world that there are many other such stories involving a variety of individuals in positions of power at various music schools.

‘Many of these people are extremely afraid to come forward with their stories, in a close-knit world of classical music in which careers are dependent upon the whims of a few powerful individuals.

‘A full independent inquiry into sexual and physical abuse in classical music education during this time is now absolutely paramount.’

Greater Manchester Police said it wants to hear from anyone who may have fallen victim to sexual abuse at the music school.

The trial heard sexual abuse was ‘rife’ at elite music academy Chetham’s. Mrs Andrade told the court: ‘It was normal for us. Several friends of mine had been raped.’

Levine Andrade, 59, said his wife Frances was devastated at being called a liar by the prosecution when she told the court of the historic sex abuse by Brewer.

Mr Brewer was director of music at Chetham’s when he began abusing his victim, then 14, in 1978.

Mrs Andrade was found dead at her Surrey home after giving evidence against the Brewers. Jurors were not told about her death until after they found the pair guilty of six counts of sexual assault.

Brewer and his ex-wife were remanded in custody and will be sentenced at a later date.
