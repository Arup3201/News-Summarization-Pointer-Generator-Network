A former NBA star, who earned $20 million during his career, is refusing to leave his Seattle home which fell into foreclosure last summer and was sold two months ago.

One time Seattle Supersonic Robert Swift, 27, looks to be the latest in a long line of once highly paid sports stars to have squandered their fortune.

Swift purchased the house, in the upmarket Seattle suburb of Sammamish, for $1.35million in 2006. 

Former Seattle Sonic Robert Swift is refusing to leave his foreclosed Seattle home which is in a bad shape of disrepair with junk and old cars littering the front drive

Swift played for the Seattle SuperSonics for three seasons

Since then, the million-dollar home has fallen into a sad state of disrepair.

The
garden is littered with empty Budweiser, Four Loko and Coors Light cans, 
while a sign attached to the front door reads ‘Danger men drinking.’

A
garage window has a bullet hole in it, while outside sit several cars 
which look like they haven’t moved in some time. One is missing a 
bonnet.

The
property, with buckets of festering water dotted along outside it, 
sticks out like a sore thumb in the wealthy Eastside suburb.

The
new owner bought it in January for nearly half the original price, but 
hasn’t been able to do anything with the place since Swift refuses to 
co-operate.

‘And it seems like a very sad story and I definitely feel for him,’ the new owner, who wishes to remain anonymous, told KOMO4.

Swift was a number one draft pick for the Seattle Sonics in 2004, but ended his career playing in Japan

Swift purchased the property for $1.35m in 2006, but it was sold for half that amount in foreclosure at the start of the year

Built in 2000, the house has four beds, four and half baths, and is approximately 6,240 square feet.

Time
is running out for Swift, who has gone past his grace period to leave. 
The owner has filled a summons and now the ex-ball player has a week to 
respond, after that Swift faces being evicted by force.

It
is a tragic fall from grace for Swift who was a number one draft pick 
for the Sonics in 2004. He played for Seattle, Oklahoma City, and 
eventually in Japan.

When
KOMO 4 tried to speak with Swift on Wednesday, a woman who said she was
his girlfriend said he couldn't come out because he was asleep after 
taking pills.

The garden is littered with empty Budweiser and Coors Light beer cans, while a sign attached to the front door reads 'Danger men drinking'

Swift's basketball career also saw him play as a center for Oklahoma City Thunder
