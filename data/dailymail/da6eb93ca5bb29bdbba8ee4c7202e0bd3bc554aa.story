The BBC has been accused of celebrating drugs culture in its news reports about the launch of a Bob Marley cannabis company.

The heirs of the Jamaican reggae singer have sparked outrage by launching what they describe as the ‘world’s first global cannabis brand’.

Critics say the artist’s fame and image will only encourage young people to abuse the drug.

They also point out that the weed he smoked in the 1960s and 70s was much safer than modern skunk.

But instead of questioning the move in its news reports, the corporation aired a light-hearted, uncritical report that even its own reporter jokingly described as a ‘puff piece’.

David Raynes, of the National Drugs Prevention Alliance, said the BBC’s handing of the topic was irresponsible.

‘As a public service broadcaster it has a duty to be fair and balanced,’ he said. ‘This is not a straightforward issue and they should have presented both sides of the story. 

'People will be harmed because of the Marley cannabis brand.

‘Some young people may be permanently damaged.

' And some may be encouraged to take the drug because of this irresponsible reporting.’

Radio 4’s Today programme devoted five minutes to the news of the Marley business venture yesterday, filling the segment with reggae music and clips of the singer’s children advocating cannabis use.

Business reporter Simon Jack interviewed Brendan Kennedy, the American investor who has paired up with the Marley estate to sell strains of marijuana, weed-infused lotions, creams and accessories.

Under the brand name Marley Natural, the products will initially be sold in American states that have legalised cannabis use. Marley, who died of cancer in May 1981, embraced cannabis as part of his Rastafarian faith and supported legalisation.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Today has an intelligent adult audience who would appreciate that this was a light-hearted business item, which did not relate to the supply of cannabis inside the UK. It was made clear that cannabis is illegal in the UK.’
