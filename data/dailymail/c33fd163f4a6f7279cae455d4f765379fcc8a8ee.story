A woman stripped down to her underwear in a supermarket  before downing a can of beer for a NekNominate challenge.

Footage of Rebecca Dagley, 19, shows the woman walking into an Asda supermarket in Fosse Park, Leicester, in a beige trench coat.

She walks around the store before coming to a stop in the fruit and vegetable aisle - and then takes a can of Stella Artois from her pocket.

The woman removes her coat, stripping down to just her bra, knickers and suspenders.

She then downs the can of beer in front of shocked shoppers.

The act was captured on film by a giggling friend - who at the end of the footage nominates three more friends to take part.

Speaking with The Daily Star, Miss Dagley said: 'I just found an aisle and tried to drink it before security came over.

'People were just looking at me like "what on earth are you doing?"

'I didn't want to do it at first but then I thought I should just have fun.'

'Everyone will go as far as they want to, nobody is forcing anyone to do anything.'

NekNominate is an online craze where youngsters are chosen by their peers to down - or 'neck' - strong drinks before challenging others to film a more shocking video within the next 24 hours.

Participants often upload the footage onto the internet.

In
 some instances, teens can be seen downing 'dirty pints' - or 
concoctions of alcohol and other substances - or large amounts of strong
 spirits as part of the dare.

The teen added she downed the drink as quickly as she could before security arrived

The act is often done in bizarre and dangerous circumstances - such as Sean Bisset, 18, who downed a mixture of  wine and gin before plunging in to a freezing harbour. 

The craze started in Australia last month and has now swept the globe - with thousands of British youngsters taking part.

Last weekend two young men died in Ireland as a result of taking part.

Ross Cummins, 22, was found unconscious in a house in Dublin in the early hours of Saturday morning and died later in hospital amid reports he was drinking spirits at the time of his death.

Hours later, the body of Jonny Byrne, 19, was discovered floating in the river at Milford Bridge in County Carlow after apparently jumping in as part of a nomination.

The game has been condemned by experts.

Dr Sarah Jarvis, medical adviser to alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said: 'Young people often say they feel peer pressure to drink to fit in, but competitions to drink excessively in a short space of time can be dangerous and this should not come as a surprise.

'Quite apart from the risk of accident or injury as a result of drinking to excess, there is another aspect to these online drinking games which is the 'cyber shame' some young people may experience.

'Drinkaware research shows nearly half of 18 to 24-year-olds admitted 'un-tagging' drunk photos of themselves on Facebook that they didn't want others to see.'
