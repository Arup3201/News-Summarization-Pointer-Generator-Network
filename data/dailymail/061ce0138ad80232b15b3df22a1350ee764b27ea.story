West Brom have signed Belgian international Sebastien Pocognoli from Hannover 96 for an undisclosed fee.

The 26-year-old moves to the Hawthorns on a three-year-deal, with an extra year's option, from the German outfit after agreeing personal terms and passing a medical.

The defender becomes newly-appointed Baggies boss Alan Irvine's fourth signing at the club following the arrivals of Craig Gardner, Joleon Lescott and Chris Baird - all on free transfers.

Pocognoli, who plays as a left-back, has won 12 caps for Belgium and narrowly missed out on Marc Wilmots' World Cup squad after injury saw him miss the final six weeks of the Bundesliga season.

The former Genk, AZ Alkmaar and Standard Liege full-back will join up with his new team-mates for pre-season training on Monday, with Irvine delighted at his latest capture.

'Sebastien is an experienced left-back who has played at a high level for many years,' he told the club's official website.

'After being named in Belgium’s provisional World Cup squad, he just missed out on Brazil, mainly because he hadn’t played enough games towards the end of the season.

'But he’s joined us with a real hunger to prove himself at Albion and get back into the international set-up.

'We’ve done our due diligence on Sebastien in terms of people who have worked with him, including Romelu Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas.

'You make your own mind up about a player’s ability from watching him play but you put these calls in to find out about their personality. The feedback on Sebastien was very positive.'
