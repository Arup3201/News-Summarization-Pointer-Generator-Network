Actor Dwayne Johnson, otherwise known as wrestling legend 'The Rock',  laid the smackdown on a video posted earlier this week by New Jersey Governor Chris Christies' PR team, demanding that his name and image be removed from the video.

The video, entitled 'No Pain. No Gain', was a send-up of movie trailers for summer blockbusters, taking aim at pension reform in New Jersey. It was posted on YouTube on July 15.

The title also was reference to 'Pain & Gain', a 2013 movie starring Johnson with Mark Wahlberg.

Johnson soon reacted to being in the 
clip, and the video was edited and re-released the next day with 
Johnson's name and likeness removed.

Despite Johnson being a registered Republican voter, and being friends with members of the GOP, Johnson says that he did not want to be associated with the content of the video.

'I know Gov. Christie. We've met a couple of times,' Johnson said in an interview Friday while promoting his new movie 'Hercules'. 'But in no way was I associated with what he had going on. He had his team of people around him who kind of put that together. I saw it. I was like well, I don't have anything to do with it, so now you've got to pull it down.'

The video consisted of dramatized cuts of Christie talking about a looming debt crisis in the state, over a soundtrack designed to mimic a big budget action movie.

In the second half of the trailer, explosions are shown, one scene quickly showing Johnson walking away from the carnage. The name 'The Rock' is then shown after Chris Christies' in a series of titles similar to a movie trailer.

Christies' office reposted the video the next day, with a tweet stating 'Unfortunately The Rock is on high demand & won't be able to appear in our Summer flick.'

Johnson told CBS New York
 that he had 'no hard feelings' about his inclusion into the parody 
video. However, despite his affiliation with the GOP, he says that he's 
friend with politicians on both sides of the aisle.

According to Johnson, in addition to friend in the GOP,  both Obama (pictured left) and Clinton (pictured right) are 'good buddies' of his

'I have good friends who are politicians on both sides," he said in the interview. "Clinton is a good buddy of mine, Obama is a good buddy of mine. A multitude of people who are buddies.'

The 42-year-old action star spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2000. Now, he says he's 'more patriotic"' than political. But he won't rule out a future run at elected office, saying he's 'learned never to say never.'

Should Johnson choose to jump into politics, he would be following in the footsteps of other Republican actors-turned-elected representatives, such as Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Johnson's 'Hercules' is set to hit theaters July 25.
