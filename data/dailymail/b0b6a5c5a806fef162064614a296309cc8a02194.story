The mother of American Idol winner Phillip Phillips has been arrested for drink driving after officers in an undercover police car spotted her vehicle swerving through traffic.

Sheryl Phillips, whose singer-songwriter son won the 11th series of the reality television show last year, failed a roadside sobriety test, having been pulled over in her van.

Police in Albany, Georgia, arrested Mrs Phillips for driving under the influence and took her to hospital, where doctors concluded she was well enough to be held in custody.

Troubled: The arrest is likely to put further strain on the relationship between Phillip Phillips and his parents, Sheryl and Phillip Sr., pictured with the singer-songwriter following his American Idol victory last year

Mrs Phillips was last night being held in a Dougherty County jail, and the arrest follows her reportedly splitting from Phillip's father, Phillip Phillips Sr., last week.

The arrest and break-up are likely to heap further strain on Phillip's troubled relationship with his parents.

Last November, Phillip was said to have refused his family's pleas for financial help, as they struggled to pay mounting debts.

His parents, who had run Albany Sporting Goods and Pawn Shop for 24 years, were upset because they had spent a lot of money travelling to support of their son when he was competing on American Idol.

Phillip, 22, of Leesburg, Georgia, shot 
to the top of charts with his first single, Home, which sold more three 
million copies, making it the biggest selling debut of all American Idol
winners.

The arrest also heaps more stress on the young pop star, who underwent gruelling six-hour surgery to remove troubling kidney stones last summer.

The singer suffers from a congenital kidney condition, which causes painful kidney stones to build up in his kidney. They're too large to pass and he must have them surgically removed.

The surgery last year was his ninth one for the complicated medical problem.
