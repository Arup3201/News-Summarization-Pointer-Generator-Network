Never-before-seen private letters from Jackie Kennedy have revealed her despair over JFK’s wandering eye.

In missives sent to Joseph Leonard, a Vincentian priest in Dublin, between 1950 and 1964, she likens her husband’s womanizing to that of her father, John ‘Black Jack’ Vernou Bouvier.

In one of her earlier letters to Leonard in 1952, she said of JFK: ‘He’s like my father in a way – loves the chase and is bored with the conquest – and once married needs proof he’s still attractive, so flirts with other women and resents you. I saw how that nearly killed Mummy.’

Private letters: Jackie Kennedy pictured with Father Joseph Leonard in Dublin, Ireland, in 1950. They would only meet once more before he died in 1964, but their 14-year correspondence would shed fresh light on Jackie's most private thoughts

Never seen before: Philip Sheppard of Sheppard's Irish Auction House in Durrow, Co Laois, says that the letters came from 'a private source'

The letters, all handwritten on personalized stationery, also offer fascinating insight into her early days among Washington D.C.’s smart set and even before.

In on she described her breakup after a brief engagement to John Husted, the man she was supposed to marry in 1952.

'I’m ashamed that we both went into it so quickly and gaily but I think the suffering it brought us both for awhile afterwards was the best thing,' she wrote.

'We both needed something of shock to make us grow up.'

In 1953, the year she married JFK, she wrote: 'Maybe I’m just dazzled and picture myself in a glittering world of crowned heads and Men of Destiny – and not just a sad little housewife . . .

'That world can be very glamorous from the outside - but if you're in it - and you're lonely -  it could be a Hell'

'That world can be very glamorous from the outside – but if you’re in it – and you're lonely – it could be a Hell.'

She says that her relationship with JFK had given her ‘an amazing insight on politicians – they really are a breed apart,’ and admitted that he was consumed by ambition ‘like Macbeth.’

But despite her fears over JFK's womanizing ways, Jackie tells Leonard in 1954: ‘I love being married much more than I did even in the beginning.’

At one point she describes her mother-in-law Rose Kennedy, 'I don’t think Jack’s mother is too bright – and she would rather say a rosary than read a book.'

Letters 
following JFK’s tragic assassination in 1963 reveal the extent of her 
heartbreak, to the extent that she even questioned her Catholic faith.

'God will have a bit of explaining to do to me if I ever see Him'

She
 admitted to Leonard that she had become 'bitter against God,' although,
 she added, 'I have to think there is a God – or I have no hope of 
finding Jack again.'

'I think God must have taken Jack to show the world how lost we would be without him,' she wrote, even injecting a note of humor.

'But that is a strange way of thinking to me – and god will have a bit of explaining to do to me if I ever see him.'

Jackie met Leonard in 1950, when she was 21 and he was 73. She and her step-brother, Hugh Dudley Auchincloss III, toured Europe during the summer and her step uncle, W.S. Lewis, who had met Leonard in the 1920s, recommended they meet up with the priest.

They would only meet in person once more, when she and JFK (then a U.S. senator) travelled to Dublin in 1955.

Over the years he wrote her back and would send her books.

'It seems to me you know everything and from all you’ve read and learned you can pick and choose the most lovely things for me,' she wrote.

'Does it give you a sense of power to think you’re molding someone else mind and taste? I hope it does and certainly no one ever had a more willing piece of putty to work with.'

Shaken faith: Jackie, pictured with her young children at JFK's funeral in November 1963, shares her heartbreak with Leonard, admitting that she had become 'bitter against God'

Despite the fact they only met once the affection in their 
correspondence is clear to see. Jackie addresses Leonard as ‘Father L’, 
and each letter is signed off, ‘XO’.

She concluded one letter to him: ‘I REALLY must stop now Father L — but bushels, barrels carts & lorry loads of love to YOU — Jacqueline. XO.’

The 33 letters will be auctioned at Sheppard’s Irish Auction House in Durrow, Co Laois, on June 10th, along with an enagement announcement, a Christmas card signed by both Jackie and JFK and a note of condolence that she sent to Leonard’s rectory after his death at the age of 87 in 1964.

The collective archive is expected to fetch over €1million.

Longstanding friendship: Father Leonard and Jackie, pictured in 1950 during their initial meeting, corresponded faithfully over the course of 15 years

Philip Sheppard of Sheppard’s Irish Auction House in Durrow, Co Laois, says that the letters came from ‘a private source’ and told The Irish Times:

‘They are, in effect, her autobiography for the years 1950-1964.’

He added that they include ‘simply astounding fresh insights that transform our understanding of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy.’
