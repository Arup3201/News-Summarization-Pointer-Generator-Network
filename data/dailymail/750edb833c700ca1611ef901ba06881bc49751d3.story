Comedian Russell Brand is considering running as London Mayor – despite saying that voting is a waste of time.

The controversial comic has told close friends he wants to succeed Boris Johnson when the Tory Mayor’s second term ends in 2016.

Essex-born Brand would stand for the mayoralty on an independent ‘anti-politics’ ticket.

His spokeswoman did not deny the reports last night. Asked if Brand intended to stand, she said: ‘I’ve spoken to Russell and he has no comment to make on this.’

However he has sketched out his bizarre manifesto in his new book, Revolution. In it he says: ‘I can’t get my head around economics’ and adds that he has no idea about the ‘obtuse’ FTSE stock exchange index. He declares his support for ‘collectives,’ and wants to ban fracking and the monarchy.

He shows little interest in promoting exports, saying of cars: ‘I wouldn’t worry too much about exporting them as other countries have their own f***ing cars.’

Brand’s ambition comes despite previously saying: ‘Don’t bother voting. We know it’s not going to make any difference.’

The comedian – who is dating make up artist and mother-of-one Nicola Schuller after breaking up from heiress Jemima Khan – has never hidden his loathing of the Conservatives. Last year he wrote that Margaret Thatcher’s death was only sad for ‘a handful of people’, and in his book, he calls David Cameron the most offensive four-letter word.

Brand’s popularity among the young is reflected by his 8.4 million Twitter followers. But his outrageous comments and antics, such as leaving obscene telephone messages for Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs in a radio stunt with Jonathan Ross, have caused deep outrage.

With nominations for the next London mayoral election not likely to close until five weeks before the contest in May 2016, Mr Brand has plenty of time to decide.

But any serious campaign would need to begin sooner, not least to raise funds. Mr Johnson raised £1 million for his 2008 campaign.

The BBC came under fire last week for giving Brand a platform on Newsnight for his extreme views, while the comedian said the BBC had an ‘anti-Islamic narrative’ and accused host Evan Davis of being ‘mates with CEOs and big business’ and ‘cosying up’ to Boris Johnson.

He previously appeared on Newsnight last year, but now admits he was ‘policy bare’ when interviewed by Jeremy Paxman.

He is not the only comedian hoping to become London Mayor, as Eddie Izzard has declared his ambition to stand as Labour’s candidate in 2020.

Duchess of Cambridge holds Prince George who is the butt of bizzare comments from Russell Brand

Russell Brand has sparked new outrage with a horrific ‘joke’ suggesting that Prince George should be beheaded.

In a shocking passage in his new book Revolution, Brand writes: ‘I note that if that baby royal they’ve just done in Blighty were to ascend the throne he’d be George the Seventh. Seventh?!

‘We’ve already had six and we’re gonna have another one. How long do we intend to let this silliness persist? Surely it’s time for us to invest in a Fisher Price guillotine.’

Tory MP Michael Ellis reacted to what he called ‘odious and obnoxious views’ saying: ‘To make a nauseating reference to the execution of a small child will disgust all right-thinking people. Brand should be treated with the contempt he deserves.’

The former drug addict also faced condemnation for urging society to show ‘loving, inclusive, rehabilitative tolerance’ towards paedophiles.

Peter Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘He should know better than to speak in this way about people who destroy the lives of children.’

Former Cabinet Minister Lord Tebbit dismissed Brand as ‘no more dangerous than a cowpat’.

Told of the vile joke about Prince George, he said: ‘If someone were to make the same suggestion about Left-wing comedians, they would be accused of being very stupid.’

The latest controversy for Brand comes just days after he caused fury by suggesting the US Government may have been behind the 9/11 attacks.

Clarence House declined to comment. Neither representatives of Brand nor publishers Random House would comment.
