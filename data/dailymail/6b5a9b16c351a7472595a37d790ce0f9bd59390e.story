Britain's fattest teenager Georgia Davis has told how she has lost an incredible 14 stone since firefighters broke down a wall to rescue her from her home in a £100,000 rescue.

The obese 19-year-old now weighs 42st 6lb - down from 56st - after doctors put her on a strictly controlled diet.

Breaking her silence, the teenager revealed she was left asking herself 'how has it come to this?' as she waited for rescuers to break into her first floor bedroom in Aberdare, Wales.

Now she has walked again for the first time and had a proper shower again in a hospital diary, The Sun reports.

She writes how she dreams of going to Tokyo to sample the food and having her own flat as she turns her life around.

And she revealed she has received cards and letters of support from people across the country which have helped her win her battle against the scales.

Her diet now consists of cereal and toast for breakfast followed by a healthy dish of meat and vegetables for lunch and dinner.

The teenager used to order up to 20 kebabs each week from a takeaway and gorge throughout the day on chocolate, crisps and two litre bottles of Coca Cola.

Initially her weight was given as 63st - but it was officially recorded at 56st when she was taken to hospital.

Rescue: A specially-built ramp at Georgis Davis' home which was built in a £100,000 operation after she was left unable to walk because of her weight

Georgia said her lowest moment was waking up to hear firefighters building a ramp to rescue her in a £100,000 operation.

A team of 50 workers broke down a wall to get her out of her first floor bedroom in the terraced home on May 24.

The teenager was forced to wear a bedsheet - because none of her supersized clothes were big enough.

She told The Sun: 'What could I do except switch on the TV and wait? I asked myself "How has it come to this?

'I felt nervous and uneasy because I knew I was the biggest I had ever been - and the most dangerous for my health.'

The teenager said she felt panicky and embarrassed - but was treated kindly by hospital staff.

Her mother Lesley, 57, was forced to raise the alarm after Georgia was unable to stand up because of her weight.

The teenager said the day she realised she was unable to use her legs was the most frightening.

Lesley and her stepfather Arthur Treloar were forced to move out of the property temporarily while the wall was rebuilt.

Georgia added in her diary: 'Mum says the council will not allow me to live upstairs again so if I return home I will have to have a bedroom on the ground floor. I don't want to live like that.'

She added that she dreamed of one day having a flat of her own and 'share it with a girlfriend'.

After weeks hooked up to oxygen in a special £4,000 bed she has taken her first steps again - walking from her bed to a nearby chair as she begins to win her battle against her weight.

She was forced to have bed showers rather than proper showers because of her weight.

Doctors had to battle for 15 minutes to 
get an IV line into her - and cut a hole in her skin to make it bigger 
so they could reach her vein.

Georgia is due to spend a further six
weeks in the hospital before going to a special obesity clinic 40 miles
away at Morriston Hospital in Swansea.

Writing about her dreams for the future, the teenager said she would love to go to Tokyo because of the culture and the food.

Fat teenager: Georgia brought her weight down to manageable levels after going to a fat camp in the U.S. - but she piled on the pounds when she came back

She passes the time in hospital reading novels like Fifty Shades of Grey - and dreaming about the future.

Georgia began piling on the pounds after quitting a fat camp in America when her stepfather was diagnosed with cancer.

But after her health scare the teenager has vowed that she will finally win her weight battle.
