Alexis Sanchez capitalised on two Sunderland howlers to earn Arsenal a second away win of the season and move them to the edge of the top four — but improvement will be required to secure a Champions League berth.

The first goal came courtesy of Wes Brown, who effectively passed the ball into Sanchez’s path with only keeper Vito Mannone between the South American forward and goal — and Sanchez duly snaffled the chance.

The second goal, scored in the final moments to flatter the scoreline, was laid on a plate by former Gunner Mannone. The Italian was faffing around with the ball at his feet when he could have simply hoofed it clear and Sanchez simply nipped in, took the ball and scored.

Man of the match: Sanchez 

The match as a whole was mediocre, Arsenal operating at training pace for long stretches and Sunderland desperate to make sure they did not succumb to a second successive monstering after being embarrassed 8-0 at Southampton last week.

But Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger naturally took the positives at the end of a week in which he celebrated his 65th birthday with a late comeback victory at Anderlecht in the Champions League.

‘Of course I am happy because we had a difficult game on Wednesday night,’ he said. ‘I believe we were in control. Before scoring a second goal, of course you can concede a goal and drop points. We didn’t do it today, we were focused.

‘We won at Anderlecht and we won here, two and a half days later. That is never easy.’

Wenger praised Sanchez for the ability and talent that allowed him to make the most of the hosts’ errors.

‘He took advantage of the mistakes they made,’ Wenger said. ‘He has a super quality, he is quick on his feet. That’s why he wins many balls that normal players don’t win.

‘His transition from offence to defence is very quick and he wins the ball back very quickly and he can take advantage of that.’

This latest reverse for Sunderland leaves them with just a single win to go with five draws and three defeats. Manager Gus Poyet insisted he was heartened by the response to last week’s drubbing but was disappointed that individual errors had again been so costly.

‘It’s difficult to analyse the game because the commitment, reaction, desire and organisation compared to last week was there,’ he said. ‘But we forgot to leave the mistakes in the dressing room.’

Poyet also said his team were angry. ‘They fought hard for the result and two actions cost us.’

But he believes Sunderland’s problem is psychological rather than any technical or tactical issue.

‘We’re getting paid to win games and we’ve won one and need to change that,’ he said. ‘It’s about character now, being brave enough to go on the pitch and believe we can win.’

Poyet made two changes to his starting line-up, bring in Jack Rodwell and Adam Johnson as Jordi Gomez and Connor Wickham dropped to the bench.

Sunderland pushed forward at the start and had the first sight of goal in the second minute, Rodwell heading wide from Will Buckley’s cross. If that looked promising it was a false dawn because their only other efforts that carried threat in the first half were headers from John O’Shea and Rodwell, and both of those were blocked. Arsenal’s first chance was in the seventh minute from a corner taken by Santi Cazorla. It was headed clear only as far as Kieran Gibbs, but he lashed wide from the edge of the area. Cazorla fed Sanchez a minute later and he also shot and missed.

At the other end, Brown nodded on to O’Shea, whose header was blocked. Then came the clearest chance up to that point of the match when Danny Welbeck, who received the ball on the left corner of the area, switched it on to his right foot and smacked the ball just over.

Gibbs was booked for taking out Johnson, the first of a spate of yellows cards either side of the break, with Welbeck and Mikel Arteta among others to go into Kevin Friend’s book. Welbeck was booked for an alleged dive in the second half but it looked a harsh decision because his movement was impeded by O’Shea.

Arteta’s booking five minutes after that was arguably lenient, for a high kick on Rodwell that might well have given him a facial injury.

Arsenal went ahead in the 30th minute thanks to Brown’s error in the centre circle. First, he failed to control a simple pass from a team-mate and then he made a hash of an attempted back pass, twisting his kicking leg and making minimal contact with the ball.

In doing so, he gave possession to Sanchez with nobody between the Chilean forward and the Sunderland goal. Sanchez dashed forward and chipped over Mannone. Cazorla had a chance to extend the lead three minutes later but his left-footed shot flew wide right.

On the hour, Sanchez’s effort from outside the box forced a save from Mannone and then another former Arsenal man, Seb Larsson, elicited a save from Wojciech Szczesny at the other end. Jozy Altidore, on as a substitute for Rodwell, headed on target and Szczesny saved again. Sanchez rubbed Sunderland’s noses in it with his late second goal when Mannone was clearly at fault. ‘Vito has been educated at Arsenal so of course I have some sympathy,’ Wenger said.

‘He is like anyone else [at Sunderland], his confidence has dropped a little bit because of the defeat last week. But he has shown his qualities since he arrived here and will show that again.’

Arsenal must demonstrate their own, more clearly and more often.
