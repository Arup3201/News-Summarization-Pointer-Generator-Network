The scandal shaking China's ruling Communist Party was triggered by claims the wife of one ambitious candidate was involved in the death of a British businessman.

Neil Heywood, 41, died in Chongqing last November from excess alcohol, according to initial reports by Chinese officials.

But a senior police chief has since cast doubt on the cause of death after claiming the father-of-two may have been poisoned.

Countless rumours and speculation, fuelled by Chinese online whistleblowers, suggest his death was linked to his professional relationship with Bo Xilai, the now-purged leader of the city of Chongqing.

In startling new claims, the city's former police chief Wang Lijun told Bo he believed his wife, Gu Kailai, was involved in Mr Heywood's death in the southwest Chinese city, according to a Reuters source.

It has also been alleged that a new report reveals how Mr Heywood told friends he feared for his safety after falling out with Gu, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

Claims that she may have been behind his death are the first direct account of events which eventually led to last month's downfall of Bo Xilai, who had very publicly bid for a place in the Party's inner circle later this year.

A source, citing accounts coming from an
 unfinished central investigation, said it was unclear how much truth 
there was to the claim by Wang. But he said had 'no doubt' that Wang had raised it with Bo.

The account helps explain the apparent rupture between the city chief and Wang, who led Bo's widely applauded crackdown on crime in China's most populous metropolis.

In early February, Wang briefly sought refuge in the U.S. consulate in Chengdu, several hours' drive from Chongqing, which suddenly made the growing scandal public.

Bo, 62, and his wife have disappeared from public view since his abrupt removal on March 15 as party chief of Chongqing. Gu is believed to be under arrest, according to The Sunday Times.

They cannot respond publicly to the rumours and reports, nor can Wang, who is under investigation.

The Chongqing government has not answered repeated phone calls and faxed questions from Reuters about the circumstances of Bo's downfall and Heywood's death.

The central government has said the 
results of its investigation into Wang's flight to the consulate will be
 released, but to date it has not offered a detailed account.

The Foreign Ministry has also not answered questions about Heywood, with a spokesman saying that he had no information.

In
 a news conference days before his dismissal, Bo scorned as nonsense 
unspecified accusations of misdeeds by his wife and said some people 
were pouring 'filth on my family'. Gu was formerly a high-powered 
lawyer.   

'Wang Lijun
 has told central investigators that Gu Kailai turned on the British man
 because of economic interests and that she wanted to destroy him 
(Heywood),' said the source, who is generally sympathetic to Bo.

Beijing
 and London-based relatives of Heywood told Reuters in separate 
interviews that they did not suspect foul play in his death. They both 
spoke on condition of anonymity.

'It's
 preposterous. The more description (in the media), the darker it 
becomes,' the family member said, occasionally breaking into tears in an
 interview in the lobby lounge of a hotel on the outskirts of Beijing 
late on Thursday.

The family denied reports that Heywood was a spy and that he was cremated against their wishes.   

'We requested the cremation. We were not forced to do so. We have no doubts about the police report,' said one family member.

Dismissed Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai had built a national reputation as a crusader against organised crime and corruption among China's elite.

But now a very different picture of his mafia-busting initiative — called da hei, or smash black —  is emerging, since Mr. Bo was fired last month after a scandal involving his police chief Wang Lijun.

Critics called his clampdown, launched in 2009, the 'red terror', saying state security apparatus were allowed to act with impunity: framing victims, extracting confessions through torture, extorting business empires and visiting retribution on Mr Bo's  political rivals.

Cheng Li, an analyst of the Chinese leadership at the Brookings Institution, told the New York Times: ‘Even by Chinese Communist Party standards, this is unacceptable.’ He added: ‘This is red terror.’

In 10 months, 4,781 people were arrested, including business executives, police officers, judges, legislators and others accused of running or protecting criminal syndicates, according to the New York Times.

Chongqing’s top justice official was even found to have buried $3 million under a fish pond, during the crackdown.

He became one of 13 da hei defendants to be executed.

But Mr Bo's spectacular fall from grace was sparked when his enforcer, police chief Wang Lijun last month sought refuge in a United States consulate.

He apparently feared for his safety after telling Mr Bo that his family was linked to an inquiry into the death of a British citizen, Neil Heywood, who was an acquaintance of Mr Bo’s family.

 The
 British Embassy in Beijing has asked the Chinese government to 
reinvestigate his death, attributed by Chongqing police to cardiac 
arrest due to over-consumption of alcohol.    

Heywood married Chinese national Wang Lulu after moving to the country and they had two children, Olivia, 11, and son Peter, 7.

He
 was not a heavy drinker, but was a chain smoker. His father, Peter, 
also died of a heart attack after drinks over dinner at his London home 
in 2004 at age 63, the family members said.

It is understood Mr Heywood helped 
arrange business meetings with Mr Bo when he was a government minister 
in the Ministry of Commerce in the capital, Beijing.

It is also claimed Mr Heywood helped 
the Bos secure top British public school berths for their son, Bo 
Guagua, who studied at Harrow and Oxford, though this cannot be 
confirmed. 

The source
 said that according to Wang, Gu believed Heywood had abused or taken Bo
 family funds to which the Briton might have had access. Heywood's 
family members said he had no business dealings with the Bos.

The
 source's account of Wang Lijun's accusations tallies with details that 
have emerged about the drama that unfolded before he took flight to the 
U.S. consulate in Chengdu, where he stayed for 24 hours before officials
 coaxed him out.   

The
 emerging accounts help explain why central leaders decided to risk the 
aftershocks triggered by unseating Bo, an ex-commerce minister known 
both for revolutionary style populism and for his courting of 
multinationals.    

By
 the time Wang arrived at the U.S. consulate, his relationship with his 
long-time patron, Bo, had already curdled into mutual distrust, said the
 source.   

According 
to the source and previous accounts reported by Reuters, Wang feared 
that Bo, eager to preserve his reputation and chances for a spot in the 
next central leadership, could turn on him after central party 
investigators began probing Wang's past.

About
 a week before his flight to the consulate, Wang told Bo about his 
suspicions about the death of Heywood, a business consultant who was 
instrumental in Bo's son attending Harrow, an exclusive private school 
in England.

Heywood 
knew the Bo family from the time when he lived in China's northeastern 
port city of Dalian, where Bo was mayor from 1993 to 2000.   

'(Wang) told Bo that the problem couldn't be covered up,' said the source.  

Bo
 was outraged, said the source, who has met both men. Days later, Bo 
demoted Wang to the much less powerful role of vice mayor for education,
 culture and science.   

Bo
 initially tried to muffle the allegations, but the former police 
chief's flight to the consulate brought the rupture between the men into
 the open, said the source.    

Even
 if Wang's suspicions over Heywood's death prove unfounded, Bo's initial
 failure to report the case could end his political career, said the 
source.   

'In the 
central leadership's view, that was too late. They said he should have 
reported the problem as soon as Wang Lijun raised allegations about Gu 
Kailai.'
