Hundreds of hip fractures could be prevented every year by adding magnesium to tap water, according to a newly published study.

Scientists at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health have found drinking water with a higher concentration of magnesium helps with hip fractures, a common injury suffered by the ageing population of Britain.

Public health experts in Norway, where drinking water varies in quality widely, found that in areas where tap water contained magnesium both men and women suffered less hip fractures.

Previous successes in adding different naturally occurring materials include the addition of fluoride to drinking water, which led to better dental hygiene across the country

However, the study didn't find a link between calcium in drinking water and the number of hip fractures suffered even though calcium is often associated with bone strength.

The researchers have said water companies should add the mineral dolomite to public supplies, because it is rich in magnesium.

The study, which took place in Norway, seems to point to a link between increased intake of magnesium and hip bone strength

It is the first time the link between calcium/magnesium and hip fractures has been looked at this way.

Co-author of the study Dr Cecilie Dahl said: 'The protective effect of magnesium was unsurprising but the correlation between calcium and magnesium in water and hip fracture was complex and somewhat unexpected.

'Therefore more research is needed to get a more reliable result of the relationship between drinking water and hip fractures and to get a better picture of the biological mechanism in the body.'

Hip fractures are a major public health problem across western countries.Â 

We already know many factors that could affect the development disease, such as smoking, height and weight, physical activity and diet, and the amount of vitamin D intake.

Norwegian researchers created a register of all hip fractures in Norway and a map showing the coverage of the various water utility companies in Norway.

This made it possible to determine which water utility company is most likely to supply each area in Norway.

The researchers compiled data from three sources; an earlier project on drinking water in Norway, the National Population Register with inhabitants in Norway from 1994 until 2000, and the register of hip fractures in Norway.

These data sources were linked together to create a compilation of fractures in areas with the highest and lowest areas of calcium and magnesium.

The researchers followed approximately 700,000 men and women over seven years and registered about 5,500 hip fractures among men and 13,600 hip fractures for women in this period.
