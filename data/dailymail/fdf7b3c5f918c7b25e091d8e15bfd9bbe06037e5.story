A French soldier seriously injured three colleagues when a ‘souvenir’ anti-tank rocket exploded in his office, according to reports.

One of the 43-year-old's comrades lost both of his legs, another is expected to go completely deaf and the third lost his foot and a testicle in the blast.

He had kept the rocket in the office he shared with two others, in barracks in Caen, north-west France, for two years before it fell and exploded.

His lawyer told a court in Caen that he did not know the weapon was still armed, according to The Local.

The explosion took place on October 4 2007 and the soldier has now been convicted and handed a three-year suspended sentence for negligent injury.

After the rocket went off it blew out windows and the door of the office, also fracturing supporting walls.

While the rocket’s owner was hit by shrapnel, his three colleagues were more seriously injured.

One had to have both legs amputated and another lost a testicle and part of his foot.

The third lost part of his hearing and is expected to go completely deaf.

In a Caen court, the soldier, who has not been named, broke down in tears, telling of his ‘regrets’, though his lawyer said he had believed the rocket was deactivated.
