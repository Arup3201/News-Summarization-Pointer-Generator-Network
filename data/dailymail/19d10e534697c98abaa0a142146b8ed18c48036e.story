An American Airlines flight was forced to turn around and make an emergency landing after cracks formed in the cockpit’s windscreen shortly after take-off.

There were anxious moments for some passengers when the twin-engine plane, carrying almost 200 people, returned to Los Angeles International Airport while en route to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on Monday.

After the aircraft landed safely, passenger Glenn Kagan snapped a photograph that shows a spider web of cracks in the left windscreen of the Boeing 757-223.

Mark Denesuk, a fellow passenger, told NBC affiliate KXAS-TV that the pilot made an announcement about the cracked windscreen about 20 minutes into the flight.

He said: ‘The captain said in all his years of flying, he had never seen anything like it and that the safest thing to do was to turn around and go back to LA.’ 

Passenger Arthur Underman praised the professionalism of the crew, saying: ‘The captain and the crew were incredible. They were absolutely calm at all times.

‘Never raised their voice. Never put fear in anybody. And the old adage is true, calm is contagious.’

Passenger Bill Cannon told FOX affiliate KDFW that his nerves were tested when the captain made the announcement aboard Flight 2448.

He said: ‘Unfortunately for me and my brother we were in the emergency lane so we kind of had a little bit more pressure because we might actually have to do something here.’

No one was injured and the airline is investigating the cause of the damage.

After a delay of about 90 minutes, passengers boarded a different plane and completed the three-hour journey to Dallas-Fort Worth.
