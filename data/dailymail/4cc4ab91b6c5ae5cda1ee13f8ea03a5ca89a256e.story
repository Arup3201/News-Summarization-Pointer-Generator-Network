A Miami mother says she was surprised to learn she was pregnant again, this time with triplets.

That's because Sharon Lewis is 47 and already has two older children, a 25-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son.

Doctors say it's rare for a woman her age to have conceived the babies naturally without fertility treatment.

Unplanned: Sharon says was surprised to learn she was pregnant again, this time with triplets. That's because Lewis is 47 and already has two older children

The school cafeteria monitor wasn't trying to become 
pregnant and thought it was impossible at her age when she was told 
she'd be giving birth to three baby boys.

Dylan, Denere and Denard were by delivered by c-section early -- at 30 weeks -- on March 18th. Doctors decided to deliver early because she developed high blood pressure.

Each of the babies weighed about two pounds at birth and are now closer to four pounds.

'This was all a big surprise to me, but 
it was a wonderful surprise,' Lewis said.

'I felt that it was nobody but God that blessed my womb at 47. I do believe he brought me to it, he'll bring me through it,' she said smiling at Tuesday's press conference.

She plans for the latest three additions to keep her young and vibrant.

She said her older children can't wait to have them home and she has lots of family to help.

Going home: The triplets were scheduled to leave the hospital on Tuesday after this press conference

They were cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit at Holtz Children's Hospital at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center.

The triplets were scheduled to leave the hospital on Tuesday after a press conference.

Lewis, a school cafeteria monitor, says the triplets were a big surprise, but 'it was a wonderful surprise.'

A real handful! 'This was all a big surprise to me, but it was a wonderful surprise,' Lewis said in a statement. 'I feel that God blessed my womb'
