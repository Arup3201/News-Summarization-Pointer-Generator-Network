West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino is at the centre of more controversy after being filmed inhaling the legal but potentially deadly ‘hippy crack’ drug through a balloon.

The England Under 21 forward repeatedly sucked up nitrous oxide, also known as ‘laughing gas’, inside his parked car before slumping at the wheel hours after his team had lost 3-0 to Manchester United.

A female friend is heard to say, ‘Are you f*****?’ and then: ‘Do you not think you’ve had enough?’. Later Berahino is asked, ‘What is up with you dude?’ as he stares into the camera.

West Brom have been 2-0 up inside 11 minutes four times this season but failed to win each game.

Nitrous oxide is popular on the party scene and users say it creates feelings of euphoria and light-headedness. Some even experience hallucinations.

But drug advice website Frank warns ‘there is a risk of death as a lack of oxygen can occur’ and adds: ‘This risk is likely to be greater if the gas is consumed in an enclosed space.’

Danny Lee-Frost, of the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency, has said: ‘The rush users experience is caused by starving the brain of oxygen. The long-term dangers to health include bone marrow suppression, blood cell problems and poisoning of the central nervous system.’

Berahino, 20, was partying at trendy Nuvo bar in Birmingham city centre on March 8 when the video was taken, according to the Sunday Mirror. He has issued an apology for his actions and insisted he will not use the drug again. He has also been reprimanded by West Brom.

Berahino said: ‘This was very poor judgement on my part and not the right example to be setting. At the time, I wasn’t fully aware of the serious health risks involved but now I know, I won’t be doing it again.’

Richard Garlick, the club’s sporting and technical Director, added: ‘I have spoken to Saido about the incident and told him in no uncertain terms that his conduct is not befitting a West Bromwich Albion player. Saido knows he has made a mistake. He has apologised for his actions and has assured the club it will not happen again.’

Berahino is not the first Premier League footballer caught using the drug. Kyle Walker apologised after being pictured inhaling ‘hippy crack’ through a balloon last year.

Dangerous: Nitrous oxide is a legal, but potentially deadly drug also known as 'hippy crack'

Berahino burst onto the scene this season and was rewarded with a huge wage rise from £850-per-week to £12,000 after interest from Chelsea and Arsenal.

But he is out of the starting line-up at the moment and was allegedly punched by James Morrison a fortnight ago after giving the ball away late on against Cardiff leading to a damaging equaliser.

In the week after that match head coach Pepe Mel praised Berahino for his ‘intelligence’ but his antics now cast a shadow over such claims.

Mel said then: ‘I spoke to Saido - he perhaps seems to be more responsible than other people of his age and I told him that I trust him and trust he will continue to work well.’

Berahino came on as a 71st minute substitute in the 3-3 draw with Tottenham and appeared to have learnt his lesson by heading for the corners when in possession late on at 3-2.

On Friday he appeared in philosophical mood, writing on Twitter: ‘Life is too short to start your day with broken pieces of yesterday, it will destroy your wonderful today and ruin your great tomorrow.’
