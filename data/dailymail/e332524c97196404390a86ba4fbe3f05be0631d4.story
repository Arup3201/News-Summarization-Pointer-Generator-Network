Mauricio Pochettino revels in hostility, he says, which is fortunate because his first derby against Arsenal is swiftly followed by a Europa League tie against Besiktas and a clash with Southampton, the club he quit for Tottenham.

It promises to be a testing week for the new Spurs boss and he is arming himself with memories of success playing for Paris Saint-Germain in the home of their fierce rivals, Marseille.

‘It was difficult to leave the stadium,’ said Pochettino. ‘It was difficult to arrive, as well. We had all the windows closed and everyone was lying on the floor. In the dressing room and on the coach, the windows were broken. It was dangerous. You need to be brave in Marseille if you play for PSG.’

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta played in one of those games alongside Pochettino and told how PSG boss Luis Fernandez became the touchline target for a barrage of missiles from the home crowd at the Stade Velodrome, including radios, mobile phones and golf balls.

‘He picked up one phone and held it to his ear and said “Hello”,’ said Arteta, another veteran of the world’s hottest rivalries. The Arsenal captain has witnessed derby day in Glasgow and Liverpool, as well as in the Basque Country.

After Pochettino’s early career in South America, however, a trip into Islington should hold no fears. While playing for Newell’s Old Boys in the 1992 Copa Libertadores semi-final in the Colombian city of Cali, his team-mate Eduardo Berizzo, who is now the manager of Celta Vigo, left the pitch with blood pouring from a wound on his head after being hit by a battery.

Pochettino claimed he would be happy to assume a familiar position on the floor of the team bus on the way to the Emirates Stadium. ‘It is not strange for me,’ he smiled, but he was not joking when he added: ‘I am stronger in the hostile situation. I like it.’

Fortunately, the north London derby rarely reaches such extreme levels, but it has been an uncomfortable ride for Tottenham managers in recent years.

Including David Pleat, who was caretaker for most of the 2003-4 season, Pochettino is Spurs’ 12th manager since Arsene Wenger arrived at Arsenal. The others, for the record, are Gerry Francis, Christian Gross, George Graham, Glenn Hoddle, Jacques Santini, Martin Jol, Juande Ramos, Harry Redknapp, Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood.

If he finds the instability amusing, Wenger managed to disguise it on Friday, insisting his personal hold over Spurs (he has lost only six of 43) is not important compared to the wider picture of finishing in the top four.

‘I honestly do not look at the satisfaction of my job by comparing it to Spurs,’ said Wenger. ‘I am more proud to achieve our targets every year. That was to be in the Champions League — apart from that most of the time to be in the Champions League, one of our rivals was Tottenham. For many years it was them or us and we always managed to get above them.’

WHAT IS WRONG WITH ARSENAL... It's been a bit of a mixed bag this season and they are inconsistent. Injuries have not helped and Arsene Wenger still has to work out his best XI.

THE SOLUTION... Once Wenger cracks the code, they can produce big things this season.

WHAT IS WRONG WITH TOTTENHAM... With three managers in less than a year, there has to be some sympathy for the players. That lack of stability is affecting the performances.

THE SOLUTION... Pochettino has to see who in the squad can cut it. Bust must do so quickly.

He did, however, accept that fulfilling those ambitions was never harder than during the years when his club were locked into the process of building a new stadium, a project Tottenham are about to embark upon.

‘It is massively difficult,’ said Wenger. ‘If you look at the history of all the English clubs who have built a new stadium and look at where they have finished, then it tells you how difficult it is... when we were in a position where we had to be in the Champions League just financially and you get into March/April and you are not, that is extremely difficult.

‘The stress is terrible, because you feel the future of the club is at stake and you have not a lot of margin. Every point you lose can be dramatic.’

Asked how Spurs might cope, Wenger said: ‘It depends what kind of financial potential they have. It looks like they want to sell the club. If an owner comes in, and puts down £400million to buy the stadium, it is easy.

‘The way we did it is the hardest way, because we had no outside financial help. We had to negotiate with the banks just to get the money at the start. Let’s not forget we paid £120m just for the ground, we contributed to build a rubbish centre at Islington.

‘We had a lot of financial problems. In the end, we built the stadium for £400m. Today it would cost £600m or £700m.’
