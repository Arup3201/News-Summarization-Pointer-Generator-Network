A young British woman travelling alone in India has been stabbed to death in an apparent drug-fuelled frenzy.

A fellow tourist has been arrested on suspicion of murder.

The body of Sarah Groves, 24, was found in a pool of blood inside her cabin on a houseboat on Lake Dal, in the picturesque town of Srinagar in Kashmir.

Discovered: Police have said the 24-year-old was found inside the boat this morning on the Dal Lake in Srinagar, Kashmir

Arrested: Dutch national Richard de Wit, was arrested about 45 miles from the scene of the suspected murder

Police said her body was discovered with multiple stab wounds and with a knife lying beside her in the early hours of yesterday.

A 43-year-old Dutch tourist is being questioned by police.

The man, named locally as Richard De Wit, is reported to have fled the scene in a small boat which capsized in the lake, forcing him to swim to the shore.

He was arrested in the town of Qazigund, 45 miles south of Srinagar, in wet clothes and without shoes. He was carrying his passport.

It is believed that Miss Groves travelled to Srinagar two months ago, intending to stay there for just four days. But she decided to remain longer, renting a cabin at the New Beauty houseboat.

De Wit arrived at the guesthouse three days ago, and was staying at the cabin next to Miss Groves. They were the only two tourists staying on the boat.

A Kashmir police source claimed that on Friday night De Wit smoked a large quantity of cannabis and returned to his cabin after midnight.

He reportedly became paranoid that Miss Groves was going to kill him, then forced his way into her room and allegedly killed her in a frenzied attack with a knife.

The houseboat’s owner, Abdul Rahim Shoda, said that he and his son discovered Miss Groves’s body at about 2.30am yesterday.

He said that his son, Samir, heard screams from the houseboat and went to investigate. He is said to have seen De Wit flee in the boat.

Senior police officer Abdul Ghani Mir said: ‘The Dutch national had fled from the houseboat in the night, leaving behind his belongings. He was trying to flee from the valley.’

It was reported that police also detained Samir Shoda as they suspect that he might have supplied De Wit with cannabis.

Police could not confirm whether Miss Groves was sexually assaulted before being murdered.

Last month, tougher sentences for sexual offences were introduced in India following a national outcry over the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in Delhi last year.

Anyone convicted of rape or murder now faces the death penalty.

Since then, two foreign tourists have been attacked.

Tribute: Messages of respect have been paid to Sarah on sites including Twitter

Family: The son of the houseboat owner said Sarah had been enjoying her time with the family

'Wonderful girl': One of the sons of the owner of the houseboat owner described her as 'a wonderful girl' who had stayed with on the boat for the last two months

A Swiss woman was gang-raped last month as she and her husband camped overnight on a cycling holiday in central India.

Days later, a British woman jumped two floors from her hotel room south of Delhi to flee an alleged sexual assault.

Miss Groves is believed to have been born in Manchester and was living in Guernsey.

Her father, Victor, 70, is a retired businessman who ran a string of IT companies in Cheshire before his retirement.

On her Facebook page, she has posted photos and messages showing she had been travelling around the world.

It is understood that she was due to fly out to Nepal in three days’ time from Kashmir.

Shocked friends have left messages for Miss Groves on social networking sites.

James Blower, a businessman in Guernsey, tweeted: ‘Can’t believe Sarah Groves is dead. Such a little ray of sunshine and not a bad bone in her body. Taken far too young.’

The Foreign Office has confirmed that a British woman has been killed in Srinagar and that it is providing consular assistance to her family.
