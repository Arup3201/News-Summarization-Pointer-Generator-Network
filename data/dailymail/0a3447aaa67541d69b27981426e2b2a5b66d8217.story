Twin brothers Phil and Stephen Turnbull cannot go to bed until the other is home safely. They speak on the phone after every training session or match and credit each other for their progress in life, on and off the pitch. They are devastated that their FA Cup third-round ties fall on the same day.

There is, then, respect, love and friendship. That, however, very quickly changes when Gateshead midfielder Phil – regarded as one of the best players outside of the Football League - expresses regret that they were not drawn against Stephen’s Blyth Spartans, the lowest-ranked team left in the competition.

‘I would have been buzzing if we’d got them. It would filter out another bad team then we’d have the chance of getting a big dog in the fourth round,’ Phil tells Sportsmail from the family home where they grew up in South Shields.

The twins were at the same team together aged nine but have played against each other professionally

Stephen – who scored a free-kick live on TV during Blyth’s second-round victory over Hartlepool and who was caught at the centre of the storm which saw Bury expelled from the FA Cup in 2006 – bites back: ‘This clown isn’t for real. He thinks Gateshead are some sort of Premier League team. We beat Hartlepool in the league above them – we’d more than match them.’

As it is, Northern Premier League Blyth entertain Championship side Birmingham City and Conference promotion hopefuls Gateshead travel to Premier League West Brom.

Mum, Susan, and sister, Kathryn, will be at Croft Park, while dad, John, and brother, Jonathan, will be at The Hawthorns.

The last time the family was split in this fashion was when Blyth hosted Gateshead in the FA Trophy in 2011. It is the only time in their 27 years that the twins – who were professionals together at Hartlepool and team-mates at Sunderland’s academy - have started a match in opposition. Gateshead won 2-0 and Phil was star man.

‘It was great to play against each other – I wanted to do him and he wanted to do me,’ says Stephen.

Phil corrects him: ‘Yeah, but I did do you – you didn’t do me. I absolutely ran the gaff and he was spewing.’

Stephen, reluctantly, agrees: ‘To be fair, he was man-of-the-match by a mile. I told our lads, “sit on my kid, stop him playing and we’ll win”. But one of our strikers – he was a lazy b*****d – he just let him dictate things. They had me left-midfield but if I’d played in the centre we would have won – I’d have bullied him.’

The pair had just moved out of their family home before the tie and bought their first place together.

Following the draw, Stephen ran tape down one half of the house and drew up boundaries. Word spread and it soon attracted media attention.

Phil recalls: ‘Someone rang us out of the blue and said, “Can you go on the radio now?”. We just thought it would be Radio Newcastle. We didn’t realise until afterwards it was national radio – we battered each other, saying we going to slap each other and all sorts.

4 - This is the fourth time Blyth Spartans have reached the FA Cup third round. They were knocked out in 1971-72 and 2008-09 but beat Enfield in 1977-78 before famously progressing to the fifth round.

‘Then the TV cameras came. We’d just bought the house off our nana. The carpets were horrific, the worst you’ve ever seen.

‘After we were on BBC we got a phone call from someone asking to buy the carpets. We thought it was a wind-up. Stephen spoke to them and said, “Aye, come around, you can buy them, no bother”.

‘Next thing, this couple turn up at the door over the moon that they’re getting the carpets. They owned a farm and gave us £50 and 12 eggs. Result.’

Result, too, is what they both enjoyed in the last round of the cup. Stephen curled into the top corner what Alan Shearer described as ‘the best free-kick I’ve ever seen’ during Blyth’s heroic 2-1 win at Hartlepool.

Phil, who was in the away end at Victoria Park that night, then starred as Gateshead beat Warrington 2-0, also on TV. Their sister gave birth to Thomas 48 hours later and Stephen was back on BBC for the third-round draw.

‘It was just an incredible few days for the family,’ says Phil.

‘I went down to Hartlepool and got a little bit of stick off some of the fans for being a Gateshead player. I wasn’t a Blyth fan, I was a Stephen Turnbull fan.

‘When his free-kick went in I was sucking the ball into the back of the net, I went off it. I was absolutely buzzing. I looked over to my mam and dad and I could see they were bursting with pride. It was a special day for the whole family. My sister was watching at home, we thought it might send her into labour. It was just the perfect FA Cup night.’

Back in 2006, however, the FA Cup was far from perfect for Stephen. On loan at Bury from Hartlepool, he had helped them to a 2-0 victory over Chester – including a certain Roberto Martinez - to land a tie at Ipswich in the third round.

Stephen looks back: ‘I had a kip after training one day, woke up in the hotel room and put BBC World News on. There it was, my picture on the telly! I thought I was having a nightmare. I just thought “what the f…”.

‘We’d been kicked out of the cup because I was ineligible, the secretaries hadn’t registered me. I was gutted. I felt guilty because people didn’t realise it wasn’t my fault.’

Phil was back at home on South Tyneside, also unaware of what had happened. ‘I saw it on the news and thought, “what the hell is going on here? Why is my twin on World news?”,’ he remembers.

‘It’s funny though, we were in the pub on a quiz machine one day and that question came up. It’s been mentioned in wedding speeches and all sorts.’

The brothers themselves are yet to marry, although Phil moved in with his girlfriend earlier this month – ‘I secretly hate his missus for taking him away,’ says Stephen.

It is the first time they have not shared a house and both agree they would have been lost without each other.

Phil says: ‘Being twins is so good for you. If he did something then it spurred me to do it. For example, when we were at Hartlepool after signing YTS, I kicked on a bit and got picked for England youths. I came back and he was nutting the back gate – he was going off it.’

‘I felt like a reject,’ says Stephen. ‘He got called up for England and I couldn’t get in the youth team. Two months later I was in the first-team. That’s always been the way, one of us would do something then the other would do something better.’

Phil adds: ‘It was like at the end of last season when we went to Wembley in the Conference play-offs, it was amazing.

‘Then he comes in with a Top Trump and scores a free-kick in front of £2.4million people.’

Before that goal, engineer Stephen had spent six months in the boiler room of a cruise ship.

‘It was horrific – 45 degrees and proper graft,’ says the Blyth anchorman. ‘I never thought I’d be playing in the third round of the FA Cup when I was in there. But I’ll be back on the ships in 2016, this will be my last year playing football.

‘You have to think long-term, we’re not playing in the Prem. Phil’s the same and he’s doing his teacher training. We went to college when we were professionals at Hartlepool and got our degrees together. We’re switched on in that sense. You have to be at the level we’re at. There’s no excuse.

‘We’ve always made sacrifices – missing school discos, New Year’s Eve, holidays – and I suppose all of this now is a little bit of payback.’

Is there, though, another chapter to be written in the story of the Turnbull twins?

Stephen insists: ‘Both of us can definitely get a result. We won’t get battered.

‘The pitch at our place isn’t great, it’ll be freezing cold and the ground will be rammed and rocking.

‘You’ve got to remember – they’ve got two arms, two legs and a head. I’ve played against players from the Prem and yeah, they’re consistently better, but we can be better than them on our day.

‘Bring it on. It’s the FA Cup. We love it.’

With this pair, you get the feeling there might just be another tale to tell come tea-time.
