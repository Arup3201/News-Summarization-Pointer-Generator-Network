The food industry lobby has been given unprecedented access to the heart of government, a Daily Mail investigation has found.

Fast food companies, supermarkets, restaurant chains and chocolate and fizzy drinks firms have had dozens of meetings with ministers.

Yet health campaigners say they have been shunned – at a time when the Coalition has been resisting calls for tough laws to restrict the amount of sugar in food.

McDonald’s, Mars, Pepsi, Nando’s and Tesco are among firms invited to ministerial meetings since the 2010 election.

The Food and Drink Federation, the lobbyist for the food industry which has led opposition to calls for anti-obesity legislation, has had 16 meetings with ministers and 99 meetings with officials since the Coalition took over, official figures reveal.

Last night public health experts said the extraordinary access showed that the Government was keener on listening to the food industry than to those with the interest of people’s health at heart.

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘These meetings are an example of how the industry has a charmed route into the corridors of power that is denied to everyone else.

'The fear of people like us is that the Government secretly sews things up on the industry’s behalf. Perhaps if the Government weren’t so influenced by them, we would have a maximum sugar level in foods by now.’

Campaigners say that without tough action to tackle obesity, which can lead to diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer, the NHS could go bankrupt.

The revelation comes weeks after it emerged that drinks industry representatives met dozens of ministers and officials before the Government’s decision to drop plans for a minimum alcohol pricing.

Today a study published in the Bulletin of the World Health Organisation says there is a correlation between countries with few regulations on food production and those with consumption of unhealthy fast foods.

Researchers say that if governments take action, such as stopping the clustering of fast food outlets on high streets or taxing fizzy drinks, they can help turn the tide against obesity.

Campaign group Action On Sugar, which wants laws to force manufacturers to cut the sugar content of their products by up to 30 per cent, will tonight have its first meeting with Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, but hopes of a breakthrough are not high.

Its chairman Graham MacGregor, a professor of cardiovascular medicine who has also led anti-salt campaigns, said: ‘We rarely get access to ministers – they don’t want to see us.

'My impression is that if the food industry want to see them, they get in. The food industry is riding all over us. It’s a scandal.

‘I don’t know what Jeremy Hunt will say, but I don’t think it will be positive.’ Last month Action On Sugar unveiled research showing that zero-fat yoghurts can contain five teaspoons of sugar, while a can of Heinz tomato soup has four.

The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has called for a 20 per cent tax on food and drink which has high sugar levels.

But ministers have so far rejected all calls for restrictions or taxes on sugar content.

The Coalition instead wants companies to agree a voluntary cut sugar in levels. The Department of Health has published details of ministerial meetings between April 2011 and September 2013 on its website but for unknown reasons was unable to do so for the period from May 2010 to March 2011.

The details show that big food firms met ministers on average once a month.

Labour’s public health spokesman Luciana Berger said: ‘People will rightly ask why ministers have spent so much time meeting with the fast food and drink industry. Ministers caved in to vested interests. David Cameron has no plan to tackle the obesity epidemic.’

Public health campaigners also accuse the Coalition of hampering action to target obesity by its decision to strip responsibility for nutrition from the Food Standards Agency and place it under the political control of the Department of Health.

Last night the Department of Health said the meetings with the food industry were about trying to persuade it to improve the healthiness of products.

‘Improving the public’s health is a priority,’ a spokesman said. ‘We are not giving business, big or small, power over public health policy but food businesses have a big role to play in helping people to lead a healthier life.’

Terry Jones, spokesman for the Food and Drink Federation, said: ‘The significant commitments developed at those meetings to eliminate artificial trans fats and reduce the saturated fat, salt and calorie content of a wide range of foods as well as providing clear nutrition labelling, have empowered consumers to make dietary choices appropriate to their lifestyle.’
