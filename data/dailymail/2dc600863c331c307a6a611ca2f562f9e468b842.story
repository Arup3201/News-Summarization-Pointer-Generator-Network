An Australian man committed suicide in a high-security Israeli jail in 2010 after being held for months in great secrecy, Australia's ABC channel said on Tuesday, throwing new light on a case that has rattled Israel.

The unsourced ABC story named the man, known previously only as 'prisoner x', as Ben Zygier. It added that it "understood" the 34-year-old from Melbourne had been previously recruited by the Israeli spy agency Mossad.

There was no official comment on the story in Israel.

ABC claims 'Prisoner X', who is thought to have taken his own life in Ayalon prison in 2010, was Australian citizen Ben Zygier

Ben Zygier was secretly imprisoned in Israel's Ayalon prison in Ramla in the wing built to accommodate Yigal Amir, the assassin of the Israeli president Yitzhak Rabin, ABC reported

However, within hours of the report surfacing, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office summoned Israeli editors to ask them not to publish a story 'that is very embarrassing to a certain government agency', Israel's Haaretz newspaper said.

'The emergency meeting was called following a broadcast outside Israel regarding the incident in question," Haaretz said, giving no further information.

Shortly afterwards, all reference to the Australian report vanished from Israeli news sites - including Haaretz itself.

Meretz party leader Zahava Gal-On, responding to the move, said: 'The phenomenon of journalists volunteering to censor information at the request of the authorities is patently undemocratic.

'I had hoped that this would have ended decades ago. In a democracy, censorship is justified only out of security considerations, subject to the High Court, which ensures that it is justified and that there truly is immediate certainty of harming [national] security.'

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office asked Israeli editor's not to publish a story 'that is very embarrassing to a certain government agency'

Such a gag order is highly unusual in Israel, where state military censors normally allow local media to quote foreign sources on controversial incidents - such as an alleged attack on Syria last month by the Israeli airforce.

Ben Zygier, who used the name Ben Alon or Ben Allen after moving to Israel, was secretly imprisoned in Ayalon prison in Ramla in the wing built to accommodate Yigal Amir, the assassin of the Israeli president Yitzhak Rabin, ABC reported.

The 34-year-old was reported to be the son of Geoffrey Zygier, the executive director of the Victoria Jewish Community Council and one of the leaders of the Melbourne Jewish Community.

Ben Zygier was married to an Israeli woman and had two young children. He gave his occupation as lawyer but secretly worked as a Mossad agent. He had reportedly spent a number of months in the Prisoner X cell before he was found hanged. Exactly what he did to end up in prison remains unclear.

ABC reported that the man attended Jewish schools in Melbourne's south east before studying law. His parents refused to be involved in the investigation.

ABC said that Zygier's imprisonment was so secret that not even his guards knew his name. However, word got out at the time of a mysterious prisoner and human rights groups wrote to the state to demand more information.

'It is insupportable that, in a democratic country, authorities can arrest people in complete secrecy and disappear them from public view without the public even knowing such an arrest took place,' the Association for Civil Rights in Israel wrote in June 2010.

When Israel's Ynet website announced Prisoner X had been found dead inside a cell that was regularly watched and supposedly suicide-proof, the story was quickly removed because of a gag order.

ABC said Zygier had moved to Israel 10 years before his death and changed his name to Ben Alon. It gave no reason for his imprisonment, speculating only that it would have had to concern espionage and sensitive state secrets.

Funeral notices from Australia show that Zygier's body was flown back to Melbourne at the end of December 2010 for burial.
