Dispute: Allen Blair Casey told police he lashed out because his partner constantly listened to Alanis Morissette

It won't be the first time conflicting musical tastes have caused a spat between a couple.

But Allen Blair Casey grew so incensed by his boyfriend's constant playing of Alanis Morissette songs he is alleged to have smashed him in the face with a plate.

When the 24-year-old, from Florida, was arrested, he is said to have told police: 'That's all the m***** f***** listens to'.

Casey's 33-year-old partner had a 
large cut on the left side of his face when police arrived at the 
couple's apartment in Jacksonville, according to a report in the Ottawa Citizen.

He told them he had been listening to an Alanis Morissette album but that his boyfriend didn't like it.

The report said officers found Casey in a park a short distance from the apartment following the domestic incident in October.

He is said to have told police: 'I hit him in the face'.

Casey was arrested and charged with domestic battery.

An officer from the Jacksonville 
Sheriff's Office said in a report he believed both men were using 
amphetamines and/or methamphetamines.

The report did not include details of which of the Candian singer's tracks had prompted Casey's outburst.

The 38-year-old songwriter's many hits include Ironic, Hand In My Pocket, and the wronged female anthem You Oughta Know.
