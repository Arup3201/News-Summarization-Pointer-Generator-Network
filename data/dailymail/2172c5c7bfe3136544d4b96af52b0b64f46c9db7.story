It was meant to be a 'survival' event for people who wanted to be scared, challenged and pushed to their limits in the build up to Halloween.

But for one passer by the fear was too much, and they mistook the appearance of 20 men and women being bundled into the back of a van by men dressed in balaclavas and brandishing guns for an actual kidnapping and phoned 999.

Armed officers and the Sussex Police helicopter was despatched to deal with the van - and police swooped on the men, armed with plastic guns. 

It even took a while for staff members, employed as actors,  to realise that the police were real and stayed in character thinking they were part of the event.

Outbreak organised the Outbreak event to 'terrify' participants as they were led into a fake military base 

The experience saw ticket holders meet at a secret location in Brighton where they were promised a 'physical horror' event and their chance to 'star in a real-life apocalypse movie.' 

They were 'processed' and taken to a fake military base, accompanied by realistic military escorts, and then sent to face challenges in the field. 

A key part of the Outbreak event, to terrify participants, saw them being bundled into the back of a van by men clad in balaclavas and brandishing guns. They were then told that they had been given a dose of a nerve agent and had two hours to get to the cure. 

It was at this crucial point that armed police swooped on the van in the village of Albourne, West Sussex. 

Spokesman for Outbreak, David Parker, said: 'Most of the participants thought the police were part of the event and a few members of staff stayed in character at first. 

'It took a while for them to believe that the officers were actually from a real police force.

Actors dress up as armed guards for the Outbreak event to make it more authentic for people taking part

Participants in the Outbreak Halloween event were put through their paces in a number of challenges 

'We believe a member of the public walking past the private land where the event was taking place saw one of the scenes where people with replica guns force participants into the back of a truck and called the police.

'Before we knew it, armed police and the helicopter had been despatched.'

Mr Parker said more than 1,000 tickets had been sold for the event, which took place all weekend and involved a cast of 60 actors.

Organisers said actors keep in character throughout the event and some thought the police were on the team

In an advert for the event participants are advised: 'This event is not for the faint hearted.'

He said the 20 men and women affected on Sunday were the last group of the weekend to take part.

They were still able to continue with the event albeit with a 20 minute delay after police realised there was no real danger. 

Mr Parker said Sussex Police had been made aware that the event was taking place but he understood that they had to take a report of this kind seriously.

He said: 'It was definitely a case of crossed wires.

'As soon as they realised the guns were plastic, it all ended very quickly.

'One of our cast members even thought we had set them up and it was all part of the day.'

He said they had taken steps to make the event as authentic as possible.

He added: 'We had even taken military advice so that our armed actors could look as realistic as possible.'  

The Halloween experience, created by White Knuckle events, saw ticketholders meet at a secret location in central Brighton where they were taken on to the South Downs.

Participants were told they would be able to crawl, climb and navigate within areas of reduced lighting, and they were likely to get muddy and wet.
