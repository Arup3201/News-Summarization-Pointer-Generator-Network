Abu Qatada has complained that his taxpayer-funded house isn’t big enough for his wife and their five children.

A lawyer for the Al Qaeda hate preacher, who has finally agreed to leave the country, told a court his four-bedroom home in London did not have enough storage space for all the family’s possessions.

Yesterday Qatada was denied bail and told he must remain in prison. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission heard he is likely to be on a plane back to Jordan, where he faces terror charges, within weeks.

Breakthrough: Abu Qatada, pictured leaving his old house, says the home the taxpayer has rented for him in North London (left) since December, which cannot be fully shown for legal reasons, is too 
small

The radical cleric, once described as 
Osama Bin Laden’s ‘right-hand man in Europe’, had been hauled back to 
prison after a ‘serious’ breach of his bail conditions, when police 
found memory sticks containing jihadist propaganda and internet-enabled 
mobile phones in the property.

Officers also found £5,000 in cash.

The Home Office moved the family to the new home a few months ago, and 
Qatada’s lawyer sought to blame his failure to keep his bail conditions 
on the consequent upheaval.

Still smiling: Labour and Conservative ministers have been trying to deport Qatada for a decade but have failed

September 16 1993 - The Jordanian claims asylum when he arrives on a forged passport.

May 1998 - He applies to stay indefinitely

April 1999 - He is convicted in his absence on terror charges in Jordan and sentenced to life imprisonment.

February 2001
- Arrested by police over involvement in a plot to 
bomb Strasbourg Christmas market. Officers find him with 
£170,000 in cash, including an envelope marked 'For the 
mujahedin in Chechnya'.

August 2005 - The preacher is arrested under immigration rules as the Government seeks to deport him to Jordan.

April 2008
- The Court of Appeal rules that deporting him would breach his human 
rights because evidence used against him in Jordan may have been 
obtained through torture.

February 18 2009
- Five Law Lords back the 
Government's policy of removing terror suspects from Britain on the 
basis of assurances from foreign governments. It is ruled he can be 
deported to Jordan.April 18 2012 - Abu Qatada lodges an appeal - potentially delaying his deportation by months.

March
6 2013 - He is returned to jail over fears he was 
trying to communicate with associates, in breach of bail conditions.

March 27 2013
- Court of Appeal admits hate preacher is 'very dangerous' but rules 
sending him to a terror trial in Jordan would not be fair.

April 17 2013 - Home Office says it will take its battle to the Supreme Court.

April 23 2013 - Court of Appeal rejects government request to appeal.

Daniel Friedman QC told the court the breach took place ‘in the context 
of the movement at short notice, no proper storage and a family under 
siege and exhausted’.

He said there was ‘not enough storage space in 
what was in effect a three-bedroomed house’.

But Mr Friedman argued Qatada should be released on bail so he could 
spend time with his family ahead of their departure to Jordan.

The 
tribunal heard the memory stick belonging to one of Qatada’s sons 
contained university coursework as well as videos ‘produced by the media
wing of Al Qaeda’.

Robin Tam QC, for the Home Office, said the bail breaches amounted to a 
‘wholesale and wanton disregard by the entire family from top to bottom 
of the requirements of SIAC’s order’.

Mr Justice Irwin described the breaches as ‘serious’ and rejected the application.

He said: ‘This appellant has in the past fled in order to avoid a court order, equipping himself with a false passport.

‘He is highly intelligent, has a range of sympathetic and supportive 
contacts, and his risk to national security is undiminished.

‘We reject the submission that he can, even now, be relied on to comply 
with his legal obligations and not to attempt to abscond.’

Earlier this month Qatada said he would return home voluntarily when a 
treaty signed by Britain and Jordan is ratified.

It will ensure evidence
from torture is not used against him at trial.

Mr Friedman said the agreement meant Qatada would likely be acquitted over what he described as ‘tainted’ charges.

Mr Tam said Jordan’s parliament will approve the treaty within weeks. 
Once approved, deportation can be signed off by Mrs May in days.
