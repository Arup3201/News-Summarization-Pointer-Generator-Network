The anxiety had niggled away at me for a week. I knew what I had to do - I just didn't know if I had the courage to do it.

Standing at the front door of my friend Sarah's idyllic cottage in the Gloucestershire countryside, I realised I couldn't put the moment off any longer.

After I knocked, I could hear her singing in the hallway as she approached to open the door. Momentarily, I considered heading back down the garden path and leaving before she could see me. My heart was hammering with nerves.

Dilemma: What would you do if you saw your friend's husband with another woman?

Then the door was flung open and my friend, whom I had known for more than 20 years, was hugging me in greeting, eagerly accepting the bottle of red wine I proffered and ushering me inside for what she thought would be one of our regular girlie evenings.

'Is Tim around?' I asked, trying to sound casual. She told me he wasn't. Her husband of several years was 'working late'.

'He works such long hours,' she said. 'But I shouldn't complain; he wants to build an extension and we need the money. Still, at least we can have a proper catch-up without interruption.'

I winced, for I had a very good reason to believe Tim was doing anything but working at that precise moment. I knew he was having an affair.

This knowledge presented me with one of the most painful and destructive decisions I have ever had to make, and one that still leaves me confused.

For as I have learned to my cost, there is never a correct way to tell your friend that her husband is being unfaithful.

At a Christmas drinks party  and then at a barbecue at their house, I'd picked up the frisson between Tim and a neighbour. The flirtatious twiddling with her hair, the way she held his gaze a little too long, the touching of his sleeve and the way she laughed at his jokes just a little too enthusiastically (Tim, who is a quantity surveyor, is not that funny) set every alarm bell ringing.

Yet Sarah was oblivious. She described the woman, a divorcee, as a friend with whom she and Tim shared evenings out.

Of course, I didn't say anything about my suspicions. Then one evening I'd been to the village pub with a colleague when I spotted Tim kissing this woman in his car. He didn't see me, and so I scurried away to worry about what to do next.

I tried to imagine what I'd want if the circumstances were reversed. Though in a relationship now, I was single for many years after splitting with the father of my 16-year-old daughter when she was a baby.

Trust and honesty are extremely important to me and I'd like to think my friends wouldn't stand by and let me be duped and ridiculed if I ever found myself with someone unfaithful.

Yet the other side of the argument was equally persuasive: it was their business, their marriage. Why should I interfere?

What swayed me was imagining how I'd feel if I found out Sarah had withheld information from me. I would not consider her a true friend. I decided I had no choice: I had to tell her the truth. 'I need to tell you something,' I said, my voice cracking. 'I don't know how to say this...'

'Say it,' she demanded.

'I think Tim has cheated.'

She let out a yelp like a wounded animal before bursting into tears. I hated being the messenger of her misery and kept saying: 'I wish it wasn't me who had to tell you.'

We talked for hours and she drained every last detail out of me: where the car was parked, the time of evening, what she was wearing, what he was wearing.

Sarah called me the next day. She had confronted Tim when he arrived home at midnight and he had admitted everything.

Apparently, it had started as a drunken flirtation, but 'got out of hand' and they had been having an affair for a few months. He blamed work stress and said it was 'only sex'. He said he still loved Sarah and they agreed to work on their marriage.

I respected her decision, even though I struggled to understand it, and for the next few weeks my friendship with Sarah seemed to continue as normal.

Coffee and cake dates are over: Being honest with her friend cost Sonia her friendship (posed by models)

We met several times and talked on the phone as well as exchanging emails and texts. Then one morning, a month after I had told her about Tim, I received an email from her. It said simply: 'I'm sorry, Sonia, but we can't be friends any more. Tim and I are making a go of our marriage. It isn't easy obviously and, unfortunately, having you around is a permanent reminder of what happened.'

She was dumping me. I was shocked and very hurt.

What would cause her to do this? Was she angry that I had been honest with her? Had I committed an enormous social faux pas by reporting on Tim?

Baffled, I spoke to various friends - without revealing Sarah's name, - and discovered this extreme reaction is common.

Apparently, if you inform someone their partner is having an affair, you can become the scapegoat: all the pain, resentment and heartbreak gets transferred onto you.

I didn't want to lose my friend, so I rang her. Despite my pleas that I had her best interests at heart, she was adamant.

'If you hadn't told me it would have fizzled out and I would have been none the wiser. As it is, you have created massive problems in our marriage by interfering. Please don't contact me again.'

I was left confused and hurt. I struggled to understand how she had 'kept' Tim, her betrayer, while chucking me.

Counsellors say this is a survival technique when people are trying to save their marriage.

If you're in a happy marriage with most of your needs met and your partner cheated, would you want to know the details? Many don't want to know.

For people like Sarah, it feels simpler and easier to live in the lie of infidelity. Normal, blinkered life can then resume.

It's been a year since Sarah ended our friendship. I moved to London and have heard nothing more from her. We didn't exchange birthday and Christmas cards.

Mutual acquaintances tell me she and Tim are still married and that life continues normally - ostensibly at least.

I expect in time Sarah will want to renew her friendship with me, either after Tim strays again or when she sees him for the weak-willed, untrustworthy snake he is.

And I will forgive her - of course, I will.

However, this whole experience has convinced me that I will think very, very hard about revealing an affair should such a situation arise again. I tried to do the right thing but, for my dear friend, it was the wrong thing.

When it comes to affairs of the heart, honesty might not always be the best policy.

Some names have been changed.
