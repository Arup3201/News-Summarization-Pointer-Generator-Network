Full of joie de vivre, tail wagging, ears pricked and alert you would never believe that Ellie the Labrador is blind.

Setting an example to all, adorable Ellie has been labelled 'Britain's Happiest Dog' since she is seemingly unhindered by her blindness and a joy to be around.

In this video of her for the first time playing fetch with a ball, which contains a bell, it is clear to see her lack of sight is no obstacle to her enjoyment.

Full of life: Bounding off after her chiming ball for the first time, blindness is no obstacle for Ellie - Britain's Happiest Dog

Inspirational: The three-year-old Labrador has been inspiring young people with her infectiously joyful attitude to life

In fact she is so energetic and happy, the loveable pooch is now inspiring disabled to children to show how disability doesn't mean a life without joy.

Three-year-old Ellie has taught herself how to walk and run using only hearing, touch and smell and has become so well-trained that she can even play fetch despite not seeing the ball.

Owner Alex Kinnear is now using Ellie's optimistic outlook to help severely ill children who are facing the prospect of losing their sight, limbs or movement ability.

Alex, 34, said: 'Ellie's my best friend and is an incredibly cute, adorable dog that is an unbelievable example of willpower and ability.

'Animals don't feel self-pity for 
themselves so no matter what's happened to them so they just get on with
it - and this can be really inspiring to people, especially young 
children.

'Ellie has taught herself to catch a ball, which is remarkable. She often beats other dogs to it too she's become that good.'

Head held high, Ellie uses her acute sense of smell, hearing and touch to find her way safely around

Alex, of Nottinghamshire,
uses videos of Ellie playing with her special ball to help children see
that they can still lead normal lives despite losing a major sense, or 
facing drastic operations.

Ellie
has become a well-known member of the community as she runs and walks 
without a lead, crosses main roads and always makes time for youngsters.

Alex
said: 'Ellie would let a child climb all over her, she's that patient.

'People run up to her because she's so fluffy, golden and gorgeous and 
when they find out she's blind they think she's even more adorable.

'I've taught her a range of different commands that she recognises by sound. For example, stop, left, right, bump and so on.

'She listens so well and is much more confident when she's off the lead - not many humans could be as independent as Ellie.'

Alex has owned Ellie for three months after she was saved from being put down by an elderly woman.

Many puppies who are born with disabilities are put down as they are often left abandoned without a home for their entire life.

But
after Ellie's fosterer felt she was no longer able to look after her, 
Alex and her boyfriend Dr Alex Mellor jumped at the chance to have her.

Confident: Alex, who has owned Ellie for three months after she was saved from being put down, said she prefers to be off the lead

With Alex, Ellie has learnt a range of commands that she recognises by sound, such as stop, left, right and bump

Alex said: 'A lot of people are 
too scared or nervous about looking after a dog with disabilities - they
think it would be too difficult, costly or hard.

'But Ellie's just a delight, she's 
absolutely perfect and I couldn't dream of having a better dog. She's 
intelligent, friendly and the most loving and loyal animal.'

Happy: Just like most dogs, Ellie has bonded with her new toy and looks as content as can be with it

The joyful pooch is happy to be climbed on and played with by the children, and seems nonplussed by these sunglasses
