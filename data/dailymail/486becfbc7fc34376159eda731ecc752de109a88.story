Clean-up has begun after heavy rainfall caused major problems in the East of the country and parts of the South with Florida's Panhandle and southern Alabama faring worst.

The rains came after a spate of tornadoes killed dozens earlier in the week, and flood warnings Thursday were in place from Massachusetts to the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida, Alabama and Mississippi.

In Minnesota, walls wind-swept ice are grinding into houses and threatening a resort on Lake Mille Lacs.

The Minnesota Department of Transportation says the mini icebergs also are causing problems on lakefront roads and are intermittently blocking lanes of Highway 169 south of Garrison.

The Star Tribune reports ice has swept onto the golf course of Izatys Resort in Onamia.

Ice damaged Randy Dykhoff's property along the shore north of Garrison over the weekend. Dykhoff, of Mound, was notified by the sheriff's office of the damage.

He says he carried several wheelbarrow loads of ice from his kitchen. It was the first time the home has been damaged by ice since 1997, when he bought the property.

As Florida Panhandle residents and 
business owners started the long process Thursday of cleaning up as 
flood waters receded, a food pantry with no space to store canned goods 
begged donors to give money instead.Manna
 Food Pantries, the primary food pantry in the Pensacola area, may be a 
total loss after 3 feet of water flooded food coolers and administrative
 offices. It can't accept new food donations because it has nowhere to 
store them, said Executive Director DeDe Flounlacker.

'If you were thinking of giving a can of food, give $5 instead,' Flounlacker told the Pensacola News-Journal. 'It's about as bad as it can be. Nobody got hurt, though, and we're glad for that.'

Nearly two feet of rain drenched Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in the span of about 24 hours. Officials assessing the damage Thursday said they were exploring whether to have both counties declared disaster zones.

The system that had blown violent winds across parts of Tennessee and Mississippi early this week and then soaked the Panhandle continued to move east Thursday. It brought rain and some flooding to cities in the Mid-Atlantic region and along the East Coast, but nothing as severe as what residents in the Panhandle and Alabama's Gulf Coast saw.Â 

The storm system caused flooding in other areas as it moved up the East Coast. Heavy rains overflowed rivers and creeks in the places including Washington area, Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Roads were closed across the region, and several people had to be rescued from waterlogged homes and cars. Commuter train service was also interrupted.

An entire street washed out in a 
landslide in Baltimore Wednesday as a storm system that spawned deadly 
tornadoes in the South worked its way up the East Coast.

The road
 collapsed around 4pm today as the Mid-Atlantic was battered with 
extremely heavy rain which has left the Washington D.C. area a flooded 
mess. A police officer told the Baltimore Sun that he saw mud coming up 
through the cracks near 26th and Charles Street just before the 
retaining wall gave way and the street collapsed into a sinkhole. The 
landslide pulled cars parked on the street into the embankment below, 
but fire department officials don't believe anyone was injured in the 
incident.

Homes on the block and surrounding area have been 
evacuated as emergency crews are dealing with the aftermath. The 
landslide swept across a set of train tracks and resulted in the 
suspension of some CSX rail traffic.

Burst 
water pipes in Gulf Breeze compounded flooding from the rain, and 
receding waters exposed buckled roadways. About 660 Gulf Power customers
 remained without power Thursday morning.

A
 boil water notice remained in effect for parts of Pensacola along 
Escambia Bay. The Emerald Coast Utilities Authority lost three service 
trucks in the flooding, including one that maintenance workers used to 
help free a woman trapped in her car, said executive director Stephen E.
 Sorrell.

Kyle
 Schmitz returned to his Pensacola home Thursday to find a dark brown 
line ringing the exterior, marking how high the water rose after he fled
 Tuesday night with his 18-month-old son. He was packing clothes, dishes
 and books that had stayed dry on high shelves, but larger, soaked 
pieces of furniture such as his bed and couch were destined to be left 
at the curb.

Schmitz told his landlords that he'd have to find somewhere else to live.

'It's
 pretty obvious I'm not coming back to this house,' he said. 'I told 
them, "Rent's due today, it's the first of the month, but I'm not going 
to pay that." They said, "We get that."'

In
 Washington County, Bridgette Phillips' husband had to kayak from the 
road to the front door of their Greenhead home to assess the damage.

They don't live near a creek or reservoir, but the neighborhood has poor drainage. Their yard had been completely submerged by the flooding. Without anywhere else to go, the water seeped into their home.

'There was two feet of water in the house. It was coming up through the floors,' Phillips said. 'It's horrible.'

A woman who died when she drove her car into high water was identified as a retired school district employee. The Florida Highway Patrol says Betty Faye Word drowned Wednesday when her Mercedes was submerged by floodwaters just north of Pensacola.

In Bay County, Florida, officials warned residents that even though the rains had passed, high water levels in lakes, rivers and reservoirs were straining flood control measures and that more flooding and runoff may be possible.

'We're doing everything we possibly can,' County Commission Chairman Guy Tunnell told The News Herald. 'It's a situation where folks have to use common sense and look out for dangerous situations.'

Officials across the Panhandle compared the rains to a hurricane - one they hadn't had time to prepare for.

'I'm gathering the wood to build an ark,' Walton County Sheriff Mike Adkinson told the Northwest Florida Daily News as he assessed the damage.
