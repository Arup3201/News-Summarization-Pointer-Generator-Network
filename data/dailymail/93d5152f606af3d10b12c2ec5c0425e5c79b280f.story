Two unknown New Zealand jewellery designers are set to be thrust onto the international stage after Kate picked four of their designs to wear on tour.

Tory & Ko, run by young mothers Victoria Taylor and Kirstin O’Brien, have been asked to supply three pairs of earrings and a necklace.

They were recommended by Miss Taylor’s sister, New York based fashion designer Rebecca Taylor, who has previously dressed the Duchess. Apparently Kensington Palace ‘liked what they saw’.

‘We’ve been emailing back and forth with her staff. They were very specific in their choices,’ Wellington-based Miss O’Brien said.

In the end Kate chose two pairs of earring from the ‘Pretty Collection’ – one in citrine featuring a bow costing £360 and another in blue topaz.

The stylish royal also chose a pair of pearl and diamond white gold earrings costing £1,500 and a matching pearl necklace costing £770.

It is likely that Kensington Palace would have paid full price for the gems as they refuse to accept unsolicited gifts from companies.

But the publicity for the fledgling brand should Kate chose to wear them is worth many times more – most items worn by her become an instant sell-out.

One Zealand fashionista also revealed yesterday that palace stylists discreetly visited some of the country’s best known labels to add to the Duchess’s travelling wardrobe on their recce of the country earlier this year.

Murray Bevan said clothes by designers Karen Walker, Trelise Cooper and World have all been considered for the trip.

World’s chief executive said tellingly when contacted: ‘I can’t say anything, not a word.’

One designer certain to feature in the Duchess’s wardrobe is London-based Emilia Wickstead, already one of Kate’s favourite designers who is happily a Kiwi by birth.
