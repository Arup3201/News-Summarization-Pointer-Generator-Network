Lined up standing on buses in front of a baying mob with their necks tied to a bridge, these are the final moments of three men subjected to a public hanging.

But rather than originating from decades ago, these pictures were taken last week in Iran, where the death penalty is still publicly used to this day.

After the ties are secured, the buses on which the men stand are driven away, leaving the hastily-convicted criminals hanging in front of crowds of onlookers, many of whom are children.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

A shocking video has been released by Amnesty International showing a public execution in Iran

Outrage: The video was passed on to human rights campaign group Amnesty International

The footage was released by human rights group Amnesty International, who have denounced the renewed surge in the use of the death penalty across the Islamic republic.

The video was shot on July in Azadi Square, in the western city of Kermanshah and features the public execution of three men convicted of rape.

During the 26-second clip in which the crimes of the men are announced over a loudspeaker, numerous onlookers are seen photographing or filming the graphic executions.

Human rights officials are concerned not only about the executions, but also the legal system preceding them.

It is thought the three men seen hanged were tried and convicted of rape within two months, raising questions about the fairness of their trial.

Amnesty International say the deaths are among at least 28 executions acknowledged by the authorities.

The group's Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui said: 'These latest public executions underline the continuing horror of the death penalty in Iran.

Amnesty International have described the videos as 'deeply disturbing' and a 'gross affront to human dignity'

'Not only those executed, but all those who watch public executions, including, children, are brutalised and degraded by the experience.

'These public displays of killing perpetuate a culture of acceptance of violence and bloodlust, rather than a belief in justice.

'It is deeply disturbing that despite a moratorium on public executions ordered in 2008, the Iranian authorities are once again resorting to this inhuman practice.

'All executions violate the right to life. Those carried out publicly are a gross affront to human dignity which cannot be tolerated.

'Executions after speedy unfair trials are no solution to the extremely serious problem of rape in Iran, which feeds on the acceptance of violence against women at all levels of society.

'The Iranian authorities should be aiming to combat this culture of violence rather than perpetuate it through these public displays of brutality.'

The executions follow several widely publicised gang rapes of women this year in Iran. In some cases, officials blamed the victims for failing to adhere to the official code on dress or gender segregation.

According to UN human rights experts, executions in public serve no legitimate purpose and only increase the cruel, inhuman and degrading nature of this punishment.

The Iranian authorities do not publish official statistics on their use of the death penalty, despite repeated calls for transparency by UN human rights bodies.
