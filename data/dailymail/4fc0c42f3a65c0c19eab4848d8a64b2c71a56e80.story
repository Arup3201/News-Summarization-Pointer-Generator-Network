Let's face it, as far as fans are concerned, what else do Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United have to play for?

The best of the rest? A third and fourth place spot, which one of them, if not two, dare say it all three, could still miss out on?

Admittedly, Arsenal are still in the Champions League, but Arsene Wenger has made it through the group stage, ticked another box on his managerial targets for the year and could well exit the competition at the same stage they have in the previous four campaigns.

The Champions League is like a speck in the distance for Arsenal, but lifting that FA Cup trophy in front of 90,000 fans at Wembley is within touching distance of all three.

Yes, the Money Men, the owners and chief executives and chairmen want Champions League football to balance the books and keep the Financial Fair Play demons at bay.

But real fans want trophies and with Chelsea and Manchester City being dumped out of the tournament in true magic-of-the-cup fashion by Bradford and Middlesbrough, the FA Cup is there for the taking. It's at the tip of their fingers. Within their grasp.

When Liverpool travel to Crystal Palace on Saturday, Arsenal host Middlesbrough on Sunday and Manchester United visit Preston on Monday, that will not be lost on their respective managers.

Manchester United haven't won the trophy for more than 10 years (Wayne Rooney has never clinched it)

The final, the showpiece event at the national stadium at the end of the league season on May 30, falls, as no Liverpool fan will let us forget, on Steven Gerrard's 35th birthday. Manager Brendan Rodgers sees it as the perfect send-off for club and country's greatest player of the past decade (surely winning the league, the only club trophy to have eluded him, would be better?).

Wenger revealed after Arsenal's FA Cup final win against Hull last season that it was the sweetest trophy of his career, coming from two goals behind in the first eight minutes to win in extra time and shrug the mounting trophy drought from his heavily weighed-down shoulders.

United haven't lifted it for more than a decade, their last victory coming in 2004, allowing Arsenal to catch them as joint-most winners sharing 11.

Louis van Gaal has described the FA Cup as 'the most famous domestic cup in the world'

Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Jonny Evans have never won it. This season, Louis Van Gaal made it a priority, alongside the Premier League title, and having managed in Spain, Holland and Germany described it as 'the most famous domestic cup in the world'.

Top-flight teams have taken the competition, it feels, more seriously from the early stages this season. When this trio entered at the third round, they all played strong sides.

Rodgers started Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho against League Two AFC Wimbledon. Radamel Falcao, Rooney and Anders Herrera were all in from the off against League One Yeovil. In Arsenal's repeat of last year's final against Hull they went with Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla and Theo Walcott.

Can one of them get a grip on the trophy now and wrench it from their rivals' claws?
