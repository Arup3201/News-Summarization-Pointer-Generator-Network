At least nine people, six of them children, were killed and two dozen were wounded on Saturday in a suicide bomb attack targeting the Indian consulate in Afghanistan's Jalalabad city, near the border of Pakistan.

Three insurgents drove in a car towards the consulate when they were stopped by checkpoint guards.

Attack: A suicide bomber attacked the Indian consulate in the eastern Afghan capital of Jalalabad. Government officials and local police confirmed that nine people, including six local children, were killed and around 24 were wounded

Horrifying: Though there were no casualties within the consulate the attack marks a severe breach of security on Indian-owned territory

One attacker detonated the 
explosives-laden vehicle, while the other two were gunned down by 
security forces in an exchange of fire.

Three Afghan policemen were among the
injured. Most of the casualties were children as the explosion occurred
near a mosque where dozens of children were attending religious classes
in the city, 120 km east of Kabul, provincial police chief Sharifullah 
Amin said.

The blast was so powerful that pieces of bodies landed inside the consulate and window panes were shattered.

An Indian diplomat said: "We had operated our security plan and an alert was there, so we were well prepared."

Though the consulate staff was unhurt, the incident has exposed the vulnerability of Indian missions in the war-torn nation.

In New Delhi, India's External Affairs Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin confirmed that all Indian officials in the consulate were safe, and then hinted that the assault had been planned outside Afghanistan.

The attack occurred on a day when Mail Today reported that India had warned its ambassador to Kabul, Amar Sinha, of a plot by Pakistan-based bombers to assassinate him, and recommended that he not leave home without a bullet-proof jacket nor travel in a convoy of less than three armoured Land Cruisers.

Despite the warning, the government did not make tighter security arrangements at its establishments in Afghanistan.

Top sources told Mail Today that the government is now going to send an elite contingent of 50 more ITBP commandoes to guard Indian missions in that country.

The warning of the specific threat to the Indian envoy in Kabul was based on communication intercepts by New Delhi.

Danger: Security forces said the bombers' target was the Indian consulate, but they were identified by police about 100 metres away, so they detonated the explosives close to a mosque

Aftermath: Crowds gather at the crater formed by the initial blast

Sources privy to the communication had told Mail Today the intercepts speak of the ISI paying half a million rupees to two militants of the Taliban's Haqqani network in Afghanistan to attack the envoy.

Response: The ministry of external affairs Syed Akbaruddin said the attack was a tragedy for Afghanistan as much as it was a security scare for India

The Jalalabad attack happened three days after a team, led by Malay Sinha, a police official in charge of security functions in the Foreign Office, visited Indian missions in Afghanistan for security review.

India has been the target of terror strikes in the past. In October 2009, a Taliban suicide bomber attacked the Indian embassy in Kabul, killing at least 17 people.

None of the Indian officials were injured in the attack.

In July 2008, a suicide bomber rammed
a car full of explosives into the gates of the Indian embassy, killing 
58 people, including senior Indian diplomat V Venkateswara Rao and 
Brigadier Ravi Datt Mehta.

On
Saturday, the Afghan provincial government said: "The attackers tried 
to assault the consulate office. But the security forces were alerted 
about the attack on the compound."

Zabihullah Mujahid, a purported Taliban spokesman, told local media 
from undisclosed location that Taliban insurgents were not behind the 
attack.

Indian 
ambassador Sinha, who was called to Delhi for consultations and to meet 
senior officials, including new Foreign Secretary Sujata Singh, was 
asked to stay back for an additional day, as India braces up for a 
strategy to deal with the fresh cycle of violence against Indian 
interests in Afghanistan.
