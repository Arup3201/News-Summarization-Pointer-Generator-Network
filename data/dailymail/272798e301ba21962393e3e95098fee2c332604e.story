Australia are the ‘dirtiest’ nation in World Cup history when measured by the number of red cards at finals compared to the number of games played.

Taking into account only those countries who have played in at least three finals, the Aussies come out on top having received four reds in 10 matches — a ‘red rate’ of 40 per cent.

Next in the bad boys’ list are Cameroon, with seven reds in 20 matches, at a rate of 35 per cent, followed by Croatia (three in 13, 23 per cent) Algeria and South Africa (two in nine, 22 per cent) and Portugal (five in 23, 22 per cent).

All those nations except South Africa will be in Brazil. The countries with the most red cards at World Cup finals are Brazil (11), Argentina (10) and Uruguay (9) but they have played many games in finals —  97, 70 and 47 respectively.

The ‘cleanest’ country — all major nations have shared 159 reds since 1930 — are Spain, with only one red card in 56 World Cup finals matches. The offender was Miguel Angel Nadal (Rafa Nadal’s uncle) in 1994. That’s a ‘red rate’ of two per cent.

England’s 
rate is five per cent, with three red cards in 59 World Cup finals 
matches shown to Ray Wilkins (1986), David Beckham (1998) and Wayne 
Rooney (2006).

Among
 those playing in fewer than three World Cups, the Czech Republic and 
Serbia & Montenegro have the highest red rates, each with two reds 
in three games.

The history of red cards at past World Cups suggests England might be happy to land Mexican official Marco Rodriguez as the man in the middle for their game with Uruguay.

History shows that Mexican refs have dished out more red cards — 22 from a total of 159 — than officials from any other nation. And half of those have been shown to South American teams.

That statistic suggests Mexican officials single out teams from the same continent. Rodriguez has given four reds in the last two World Cups — to Paraquay, Serbia, Australia and Chile.
