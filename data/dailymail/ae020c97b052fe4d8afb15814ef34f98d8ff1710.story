Almost five years on from the swine flu pandemic, a mother-of-two who had previously suffered from no health issues, contracted the disease and died within six weeks.

Jane Garner, 35, was in good health until a chest infection left her so ill that she had to be admitted to hospital. There, doctors told her she had contracted swine flu which had led to pneumonia. 

The former dental nurse, from Queniborough, Leicestershire, developed the infection six weeks ago. Yet, despite taking antibiotics and antivirals the illness would not shift.

She was struggling to breathe on February 21 and her partner Lee Bagnall, rushed her to hospital.

When they arrived, he was told that she was seriously ill with pneumonia which had developed from a complication of swine flu.

Mrs Garner was put into a medically-induced coma and given a ventilator to help her breathe.

After being transferred to specialist 
Glenfield Hospital in Leicester, she received extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (Ecmo) which artificially added oxygen to her blood, giving her lungs a chance 
to recover.

A week later, the mother of Madison, eight, and Bradley, three, appeared to be getting better and she was brought out of the coma and taken off the Ecmo treatment.

But in just a few hours, her condition rapidly deteriorated and doctors called Mr Bagnall and told him that nothing more could be done to save his partner.

On March 8, Mrs Gardner died in hospital. Mr Bagnall said that the family were 'stunned' by the outcome because his partner seemed to be 'getting better every day'.

He said: 'I think the doctors were as taken aback as me.

'Everything had been so positive. Then I spent the next four hours watching her fade away.

'A few people mentioned that they had had swine flu a few years back but had recovered and been fine.

'On
 the Friday, she was a little grumpy because all she wanted was to get 
out of bed and we thought she would be home in no time.

'We just never expected this.'

Mr Bagnall said that he had been overwhelmed by the support that his family had received. He paid tribute to the care that his partner Jane Garner received at Glenfield Hospital in Leicestershire (pictured)

Yet despite the tragedy, Mr Bagnall said that he had been overwhelmed by the support that his family had received. He paid tribute to the care that his partner had received in hospital.

He described the events as an 'absolute tragedy' but said that he did not think the hospital could have done any more to save her.

He described his partner as having 'lovely hazel eyes' and told of her friendly character.

'We clicked as soon as we met five years ago and we started finishing each others' sentences,' he said.

Mr Bagnall said that he believed Mrs Garner had been in a bay specialising in treating swine flu.

Patients from across the country were flown in to receive Ecmo treatment at Glenfield because it is one of the few hospitals to offer the treatment, he said. 

The hospital would not comment on whether any other patients had died.

Susan Davey, a senior nurse for infection prevention at Leicester hospitals, said: 'The most common complications of influenza are bronchitis and secondary bacterial pneumonia.

'The young, the elderly, pregnant women and individuals with respiratory or cardiac conditions or reduced immunity are more vulnerable to flu.'

The disease was first identified in Mexico in April 2009 and went on to spread across the world.

Due to the fact that it was new virus, few people were resistant to the illness.

Professor Nick Phinn, a flu expert from Public Health England, said that swine flu was now regarded as one of the seasonal flu strains.

Professor Phinn said: 'Over the past five years or so, the percentage of the population with some degree of immunity, either naturally or through vaccination, has been rising.

'However, immunity wanes over time, the virus is constantly changing and evolving and there are other strains of influenza circulating, making flu vaccine the most important step in protecting vulnerable people against flu infection.'
