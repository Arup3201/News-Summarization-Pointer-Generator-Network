Royal rift: Princes Andrew and Charles look glum at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee service in 2012

The clinking of cutlery and popping of corks could be heard from the other end of the corridor. Behind the partly closed gilt doors of the grand dining room at Buckingham Palace, the Prince of Wales was holding court with his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall. The celebration to mark his 66th birthday was in full swing, with the couple’s closest friends charging their crystal glasses to toast the Prince.

At the other end of the Palace, Prince Andrew was in his private residence sharing a low-key supper with a friend or two of his own. Sources close to the Duke of York’s circle say he had not been invited to the party and did not want to spend the evening alone.

The fact that his elder brother had not extended him an invitation was no surprise to the Duke, his close friends or his courtiers.

For the truth is that relations between Charles and Andrew have been strained for some time. And as he battles through the most challenging period of his life, Prince Andrew cannot count on Charles’s support.

Accused of having sex with a minor – an allegation he categorically denies – the Duke of York’s reputation is mired in controversy, and a potentially embarrassing and unprecedented court case looms over the Royal Family like a dark cloud.

But while Andrew has been cushioned by courtiers and protected by certain relations and trusted friends, the one family member perhaps best versed to help guide him through these uncharted waters appears to have turned his back.

Numerous sources close to the Duke have told The Mail on Sunday that he has been ‘cut off’ by Charles who has ‘left Andrew out in the cold’ during his darkest hours.

The ‘shutters came down’ according to one source close to a senior member of the Royal Family when Prince Andrew was named in US court papers by Virginia Roberts, who claims she was made to have had sex with him when she was a 17-year-old ‘sex slave’.

She had been working for the Prince’s friend and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein – who had already been jailed for sex offences.

Charles, no stranger to controversy when it comes to his private life, would certainly be well-placed to counsel Andrew and offer some sage advice, but it is said that the Prince of Wales has so far refused to discuss the scandal with his brother.

While they have historically had fall-outs, Andrew’s friends believe this to be the most serious yet. Relations between them are apparently so strained that they barely speak.

A friend of a prominent family member says that Charles – a great memo and letter writer to his family, particularly when it comes to matters of importance – has not written to Andrew for months.

‘The froideur is worse than ever,’ the friend said. ‘Charles considers the whole sex scandal degrading, damaging and very embarrassing.

‘He thinks that his brother has made some very bad decisions but he has said nothing to Andrew, he simply hasn’t communicated with him at all. There’s been a very icy silence.’

Charles’s patience with Andrew apparently snapped when he was photographed in New York with Epstein in 2011 after the tycoon had served an 18-month prison sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution.

The damage to Andrew’s reputation began to show when he stepped down as the UK’s Trade Envoy that year, but more damning allegations came in January this year when Ms Roberts, now 31, went to court. While the Prince of Wales’s spokesman denies there has been a fall out, insisting rumours of a rift are ‘categorically untrue’, sources close to Prince Andrew say he feels that he has been deliberately frozen out by his brother.

Charles is evidently easily rattled when it comes to his problematic sibling – according to another well-placed source who is an acquaintance of Charles, the Prince will not have Andrew’s name mentioned in his presence.

‘I was told never to mention Andrew’s name in the Prince of Wales’s company,’ the source revealed.

The tension between the brothers is a sensitive subject for the Royal Family. ‘This is no brotherly spat,’ said a friend of one senior Windsor. ‘It is a seismic shift downhill in Charles’s relationship with his errant brother which seems terminal.

‘Andrew is having to live with the harsh reality that Charles has cut him off and left him out in the cold.’

Andrew has been relying heavily on the support of his immediate family. His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson was the first to rush to his defence, saying on American television that Andrew is a ‘humongously good man’.

But while there have been unprecedented public denials from the Palace, and a calculated show of unity from the Queen, Prince Edward and his wife Sophie Wessex, who all recently attended an engagement with Andrew, there has, tellingly, been no show of public support from Charles, who has refused to be drawn into the scandal.

‘He does not want to become involved in any way. He is very angry that his brother has put the family in this very difficult and embarrassing situation,’ added the friend.

‘Charles has very serious concerns about Andrew. He can see legal fees going through the roof, there’s a serious risk of Andrew becoming involved in a court case, and unanswered questions about his friendship with Epstein and this girl.

‘Then there’s the fact that Andrew is still living with his ex-wife and has just bought a very expensive ski chalet with her. Charles thinks Andrew is making a fool of himself where Sarah is concerned.’

With Andrew’s aides swinging into damage limitation mode in conjunction with the heavyweights at royal lawyers Harbottle and Lewis, a firefighting PR strategy is in motion.

Last month Buckingham Palace issued a statement saying: ‘It is emphatically denied that the Duke had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. The allegations are false and without any foundation.’

And last month in The Mail on Sunday, Andrew’s ex-girlfriend Koo Stark broke her 32-year silence about their friendship in order to defend him, saying: ‘I firmly believe I can help rebut, with authority, the allegations against him.’

The Queen too has shown her loyalty in her own unique and subtle way. She bestowed the honorary title of Vice Admiral of the Royal Navy on her son on his 55th birthday last month, sending a clear and unequivocal message to the country that she was standing by her son both in private and in public.

But the source from Charles’s circle said: ‘Charles knows the Queen will always be a staunch defender of her second son almost to the point of lacking objectivity and reason… which has irritated him beyond measure over the years.’

When Andrew celebrated his 55th birthday quietly and deliberately out of the limelight with friends, Charles was not invited to the private dinner. A close confidant of Andrew said: ‘He celebrated with some friends at a restaurant in Central London, but Charles wasn’t there. He wasn’t invited.’

The brothers did spend Christmas together at Sandringham where, by all accounts, they appeared cordial.

Charles and Andrew do have a history of fall-outs. Andrew was said to be ‘spitting feathers’ when, in 2011, the decision was made to strip his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie of their personal protection officers.

The cost-cutting measure – endorsed by Charles, who is known to want a more streamlined Royal Family – was tacitly agreed to by the Queen and led to a dispute between the brothers. Andrew argued that his daughters still needed protection but his pleas fell on deaf ears.

‘Andrew was fuming, spitting feathers,’ said a source. ‘He fought and fought but he lost to Charles.

‘Charles is forging a path as the elder statesman and the force of the family and it’s his way or no way at all. In many ways it’s a rather Tudor court. The shutters came down on Andrew and that was it.’

There was further acrimony when neither Andrew, Prince Edward nor the Princess Royal were invited to join the Queen during the closing celebrations for the Diamond Jubilee in 2012. With the Duke of Edinburgh in hospital suffering from a bladder infection, the Queen was left to carry out a Buckingham Palace balcony appearance accompanied only by Charles’s family of Camilla, William and Kate, and Harry. It was, according to one family friend, Charles’s decision that only the most senior members of the family should accompany the Queen to wave to the masses who had gathered in The Mall.

The episode is said to have driven a greater wedge between Charles and Andrew, who resented his brother for the public snub. Moreover, it appeared to suggest that Andrew’s place within the scheme of things was becoming more tenuous.

A source close to the family said: ‘Edward took it on the chin, there was no whining sniping or pleading, but Andrew was livid. He never forgave Charles.

‘Interestingly Andrew has become much closer to Edward and relies on him more these days.

‘It’s no accident that Andrew was allowed to put a picture of the Wessexes and the Queen on his Facebook page the other week.

‘It was published with the Queen’s permission and blessing and gave a much needed emphasis of the warm and close brotherly relationship between Edward and Andrew.’

A spokesman for Andrew declined to comment on private family matters, but a senior Royal aide dismissed the idea of a rift as untrue. 

However, neither would comment on the specific detail of how Charles and Andrew have behaved towards each other in recent months, saying it is a private family matter.

A Clarence House spokesman said: 'Family relationships are a private matter but this story, as relayed, is categorically untrue.' 

Clearly, however, there is a coolness that is causing tension in the family – and it is being openly discussed. While the Queen, understandably, is reluctant to get involved it looks as though she may be required to act as peacekeeper once again.
