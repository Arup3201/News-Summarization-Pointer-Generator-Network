An explosive new book has claimed that the Queen Mother was 'insane and inebriated' during the final 20 years of her life.

The book, a biography of the Queen Mother's steward William Tallon, also makes a number of allegations about the rest of the royal family, including accusations of drunkenness and swearing.

But courtiers have hit back, with the Queen's cousin Margaret Rhodes, a former lady-in-waiting herself, describing the book as 'disgusting' and 'nonsense'.

'One really would have hoped that the Queen Mother was above such allegations,' said Mrs Rhodes, 89, in an interview with the Sunday Express.

'To write such absolute nonsense about someone who is dead and unable to answer back is disgusting.' 

Backstairs Billy: The Royal Life of William Tallon is the work of historical novelist Thomas Quinn, whose oeuvre  includes works on angling and shooting as well as a series of memoirs based on the lives of aristocratic serving staff.

In the blurb for the book, which is due to be published in March 2015, Quinn describes Tallon as 'charming, amusing, occasionally bitchy - and extremely promiscuous'.

Tallon, who was known as Backstairs Billy and was the son of a shopkeeper, worked for the Queen Mother for more than 50 years.

The equerry, who died in 2007, was still working for the royal when she died at the age of 101 in 2002. 

'As a child growing up in relative poverty in Coventry, Billy thought working for the royal family would be hugely glamorous,' continues the blurb.

'As a teenager he sent letters to the royal household begging to be taken on. It was a shock, however, when he found himself barely out of his teens and working for a family that had two very different sides. 

'As far as the public was concerned, the royal family was a model of reticence. But Billy saw the other side of a family whose members loved drinking and smoking, swearing and playing sometimes cruel practical jokes on each other in private. 

'They hated anything serious and were constantly making jokes at each other's expense. The Queen Mother was especially good at all this, according to Billy. 

Nonsense: The Queen Mother's niece Margaret Rhodes has rubbished the claims, saying they are 'nonsense'

'This was partly because she had a great sense of fun and partly because, for the last twenty years of her life, she was dotty to the point of lunacy.'

It also goes on to claim that the reason the Queen Mother loved Tallon so much was because he knew how to make gin and tonics the way she liked them - 'nine-tenths gin and one-tenth tonic'.

This, says Mrs Rhodes, is just one of the book's many inaccuracies - particularly because the Queen Mother 'never drank a gin and tonic, not ever'.

'She preferred a gin martini mix which she usually made herself,' continued Mrs Rhodes. 'She drank no more than one or two drinks of an evening but never drank too much.

'She was very conscious of her standing and knew what was proper of someone in her position to do and not to do.

'Of course she had a wonderful sense of humour. She laughed until she cried watching programmes like Dad’s Army and Keeping Up Appearances, but she wasn’t some party girl and she certainly didn’t go potty. Absolutely not. 

'She could talk to anyone about anything, from rhododendrons to Persian poetry. She knew her onions, right until the end.'

Buckingham Palace has been approached for comment.
