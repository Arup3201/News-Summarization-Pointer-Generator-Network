When it comes to rescuing damsels, it doesn't get more disssstresssing than having to save a snake.

But a firefighter put his high school reptile-handling experience to good use on Sunday night when he pulled a 6-foot-long pet python from a burning home in western Michigan.

Muskegon firefighter Scott Hemmelsbach told The Muskegon Chronicle that he reluctantly agreed to enter the two-story, smoke-filled house to retrieve the snake after all his colleagues had refused the job.

He says he cradled the 'weighty' snake like he would a child before carrying it to safety.

'I would do it for any creature': Firefighter Scott Hemmelsbach holds a python after, somewhat reluctantly, rescuing it from a burning home in Muskegon, Mich., on Sunday

'It was trying to crawl up the side of his terrarium and get out,' Hemmelsbach explained.

'His face was pushed up on the screen and trying to get out. There was a lot of smoke and he was trapped.'

The firefighter said he learned how to handle snakes while he was at Grand Haven High School, where he helped showcase them.

'I'd take them around and show them to the kids in the elementary classes,' he said.

'That didn't bother me at all.'

When Hemmelsbach reached the python inside the home, he gingerly handled him so not to scare the reptile.

'I removed the screen off the top and knew to approach it by coming up behind his head. He became very active, and I was glad because that meant that he was OK.'

Two people in the home escaped without injury, fire officials said.

The fire significantly damaged the home, and the cause remains under investigation.

'I would do it for any creature,' Hemmelsbach said.

'I'm just glad it had a happy ending.'
