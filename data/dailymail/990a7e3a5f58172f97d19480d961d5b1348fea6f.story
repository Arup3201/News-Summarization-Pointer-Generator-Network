Manchester
 United's players have been getting to know new boss Louis van Gaal and 
will be getting familiar with his personality and some of his managerial
 traits.

Here,
 Sportsmail has exclusive extracts from Maarten Meijer's explosive new 
book on the Dutchman which lifts the lid on the new man in charge at Old
 Trafford.

The Old Trafford dressing room has superstars and superstars have egos. But United players are about to learn that Louis van Gaal is big enough to take on any truculent star who thinks he is bigger than the club.

For the 
Dutchman, moving into Manchester United will be a re-run of when he was 
made manager of German giants Bayern Munich. Van Gaal spent four months 
fighting to impose his will on a dressing-room full of big-name players 
who thought they had a divine right to wear the shirt.

Volatile
 Italian striker Luca Toni, one of those who fell out with the 
forthright coach, revealed just how far Van Gaal went to show who was in
 charge.

‘I remember how he once tried to make it clear that he wasn’t afraid to withdraw the so-called big names,’ Toni said.  ‘He just dropped his trousers to show us that he had the b***s to do so.’

Munich in 2009 sounds much like the remit for Manchester United now: a big club fallen on bad times; huge expectation but fear of failure; taking over from a manager who had been in charge for less than a year.

United fans should be warned that if he follows the same blueprint, and he probably will, expect things to get worse before they get better. Van Gaal’s start at Munich was so poor and so  disruptive that by late October he was one game from the sack. Yet he  survived, and finished that first campaign by winning the Bundesliga and German Cup double as well as getting to the Champions League final.

Munich were in a mess when he arrived after the 300-day reign of Jurgen Klinsmann and Van Gaal was seen as the saviour, just as he is in Manchester after David Moyes’ failure.

He announced himself at his first press 
conference by reciting the club’s motto: ‘Mia san mia’ (We are who we 
are) and asserting: ‘I am who I am: confident, dominant and honest; a 
workaholic, innovative but also warm and family friendly.’

Few agreed with the second part of that statement as he set about imposing his plans. Within days of taking over, he made it clear that defender Lucio, captain of Brazil’s national team and a first choice at Bayern for five years, did not fit into his plans and sold him to Inter Milan.

He continually left out Franck Ribery, the Bundesliga Player of the Year 12 months earlier, because he didn’t agree with Van Gaal’s plan to play him as a No 10, preferring to stay on the left wing.

It took Van Gaal 10 matches of tinkering before he settled on a preferred line-up, during which time the team seemed rudderless and the coach’s credentials were questioned. For the first four months he and Bayern Munich looked incompatible.

There was speculation that he would be sacked if Bayern couldn’t beat Eintracht Frankfurt in late October. With four minutes left and the score 1-1, Van Gaal replaced Toni with defender Martin Demichelis and moved centre-half Daniel van Buyten up front.

A home crowd of 69,000 whistled and jeered but two minutes later Van Buyten headed in Thomas Muller’s cross. It proved one of several season-defining moments.

The tensions in a frustrated team regularly bubbled to the surface, and sometimes spilled into public view, such as when Toni was substituted at half-time in a game against Schalke and the Italian promptly went home.

Success: Van Gaal took ten games to settle on a preferred line-up before leading Bayern to the title

As one of the mutineers who couldn’t get on with Van Gaal, he was given short shrift. ‘We have rules and we have to work within the rules,’ said the coach. ‘Luca Toni did not. Every player, whether he is a world champion or whatever, has to accept he does not always play.’ Others spoke out.

Ribery said that the coach’s philosophy was hard to understand. 

‘In training no-one is laughing. Everything is too serious,’ he said. 

Defender Philipp Lahm gave an interview in which he criticised everything from the club’s transfer policy to tactics. He was fined. 

Van Gaal’s time at Barcelona was punctuated by conflict. Despite his success in the first two seasons, they were three fraught years.

He struggled to connect with the Catalan fans and his failure to  master Spanish often led to him losing his cool at press conferences. 

When he left he announced: ‘Friends of the press I am leaving. Congratulations.’

He had to fight to make players understand his vision and his tactical rigour caused friction.

That was nowhere more clear than in his 
relationship with Rivaldo, the Brazilian prima donna who had cost 
Barcelona €20million. For two seasons he was at the top of the scoring 
charts but then fell out with his manager in the third.

Conflict: Van Gaal had to fight to make players at Barcelona understand his vision and tactics

Rivaldo refused to play on the left of a 4-3-3 system and his punishment was a spell on the bench.Telling the World Player of the Year to stick to his position on the left or make space for others instead of roaming freely may well have been integral to a tactical  plan but it was not the best way to survive the football politics of Catalonia. 

Replacing Barca superstars with a busload of former Ajax players,  did not endear him to the locals either. In the end there were more enemies than friends; more tiffs than trophies.

Only time will tell how his methods will go down in United’s dressing-room.

 At Bayern Munich, even the club’s management had doubts about the way Van Gaal was  emerging as a control freak as he fought to deal with issues behind the scenes. There are echoes of Sir Alex Ferguson in Van Gaal’s style but, initially, it didn’t go down well at Bayern. 

President Uli Hoeness said:  ‘Bayern can no longer be controlled by one person. Louis van Gaal is of the opinion that he has to organise everything by himself, but an individual cannot handle all of that.’The great Franz Beckenbauer told the individualistic Dutchman to ‘delegate more responsibility’. 

The board even questioned, albeit implicitly, the professional confidence of their head coach by suggesting it might be better to switch from a 4-3-3 system to 4-4-2.

Van Gaal simply stuck to his methods. He said: ‘When I started with Ajax in 1991 in the first half of the season the people only wanted Johan Cruyff. That wasn’t fun for me.

Not fun: Van Gaal's first few months at Ajax were difficult as fans would have preferred Johan Cruyff

‘With Barcelona in 1997 it was the same. It took four or five months before it was much better.  It was similar with AZ and exactly the same with Bayern.

‘I predicted at the beginning of the season we would need a few months’ patience until everything worked out. The trophies are handed out in May.’

He was proved right. By the end of the season the Germans were partying with their two domestic trophies and despite missing out on a treble when  they lost in Madrid to Jose Mourinho’s Inter Milan, they had re-established themselves at Europe’s top table.

Manchester United fans will pray that, even if the going gets tough for the first few months, their new manager will be proved right again. And that he’s still got the b***s to do the job.
