Accused: Leading child psychologist Gillian Levett at the Health and Care Professions Council

A Harley Street psychologist was struck off yesterday for an ‘inappropriate relationship’ with a public schoolgirl patient.

Gillian Levett, 65, had given her two assessments and had no further contact until the anorexic teenager turned up bedraggled at her clinic a year later, asking for help.

The £180-an-hour psychologist, who has practised for 35 years, said the 17-year-old told her she had been abandoned by her formerly wealthy parents and had no home or money.

According to Miss Levett, she spent 18 months helping the girl back on her feet.

She let the teenager stay at her South Coast holiday home and introduced her to a rich American couple who paid her school fees.

But the psychologist was found guilty of misconduct and struck off over the relationship with Miss A, who cannot be identified.

Speaking
to the Mail yesterday, Miss Levett claimed she was being punished for 
being a ‘Good Samaritan’ and helping the girl after her parents 
abandoned her.

‘I was too trusting,’ she said. ‘When 
Miss A turned up on a Friday, I contacted social services – and they 
said they were off duty. Should I have told her to go and sleep in the 
park till the Monday?’

Miss Levett insisted the girl had not been her patient when she helped her out of ‘kindness’.

She
claimed the teenager turned up in November 2007, claiming to be 
‘frightened’ of her father and unwilling to return to her mother, who 
was living in Monaco.

The patient, now 23, later got back in touch with her father and went on to lodge a complaint.

Miss Levett said three 19th birthday cards she sent signed ‘Love from  Gillian xxx’ were then used against her in evidence.

‘There were so many Good Samaritans who helped her, I wasn’t the only one,’ she added.

Sitting in London, the Health and Care Professions Council ruled that Miss A had been her patient and Miss Levett’s involvement was ‘reckless’ and ‘harmful’.

It added that she ‘continues to pose a significant risk to patients and the public’.

There were no allegations of any romantic or sexual relationship by either side.

The psychologist, who is single, was also found to have had ‘inappropriate relationships’ with two other ex-patients. She plans to appeal.
