Victim: Breck Bednar, 14, who was stabbed to death in Grays, Essex, more than 30 miles from his family home

An oil millionaire and his partner today described their 'murdered' 14-year-old son as a 'gifted and dedicated student' after he was stabbed to death.

Breck Bednar, 14, was attacked in Grays, Essex, 30 miles from his home after travelling meet a man he knew online, it was claimed.

The church-going teenager had told his parents that he was spending the night at a friends house a few streets away from his home in Caterham, Surrey.

But secretly the teenager – who was said 
to be addicted to online computer games – travelled by train to the flat
 of an 18-year-old stranger who it is believed he had played with over 
the internet.

Hours later the boy was found dead in a flat in Grays. Paramedics battled to revive him but he was pronounced dead.

Today his parents, oil futures trader Barry Bednar, 49, from Houston, Texas, and US-born teaching assistant Lorin LaFave, 47, issued a statement through police paying tribute to their son.

It said: 'Our family is devastated by the loss of our beloved Breck David LaFave Bednar.

'He was a kind, intelligent, thoughtful boy with a good sense of humour and was a dedicated student at St Bede's School in Redhill and extremely gifted in computing, electronics, and engineering.'

Breck was a member of the Air Cadets with the 135 Squadron in Redhill and a member of St John the Evangelist Church of England Church in Caterham.

'His three younger siblings knew him as a kind and loving older brother who always helped out by looking after them,' the statement added.

'The wider family remember him as a well-mannered, social, and confident boy who was always thoughtful and patient with his younger cousins.

'We are all in shock, and so grateful for the thoughts and prayers of friends and family at this difficult time.'

Mr Bednar, 49, works for 
investment firm Tandem Partners and owns a £1million flat in Canary
 Wharf as well as a £600,000 home in Surrey.

Breck's mother Lorin LaFave revealed 
last night that she complained to Surrey Police in December that a man 
was trying to 'control' her son online.

Miss LaFave said: 'The problem was the predator who was trying to 
control his ideology about religion, government, family, education.

'Breck
 looked up to him because of his interesting manner and computer skills.
 Breck couldn't see the bad and when I pointed out his obvious lies, 
they were overlooked by Breck and his friends.'

Surrey Police said the case has been 
referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission because of 
'recent contact' with the family.

In a statement the force said: 
'Surrey Police is working with Essex Police following the tragic death 
of a 14-year-old boy from Caterham in Grays, Essex on Monday.

'Due to recent contact Surrey Police had with the victim's 
family the case has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints 
Commission (IPCC).

'The previous contact relates to a report by a 
relative in December 2013 regarding online activity.'

Vicar Jerry Garton said at a service at St John the Evangelist church in Caterham that the community is in 'complete shock'.

After the service Rev Garton added: 'It has been a very difficult time for the family. I have been with them for the past week offering everything we can.

'The family are obviously distraught and trying to come to terms with what has happened. They are all regulars at the church, and the congregation are in shock.

'The community has been really shaken up by what has happened. With regard to the rest of the investigation, we don't know exactly what happened.'

Lewis Daynes, an 18-year-old computer engineer, appeared in court yesterday charged with murder, and was remanded in custody.

He is due to appear before Chelmsford Crown Court today.

Breck’s
 cousin Tanner Barth said he was ‘addicted’ to video games and had 
stopped going to church and turned against his parents after meeting a 
man on the internet.

He said that Breck was an ‘incredibly smart, funny, and cute 14-year-old boy’, before adding: ‘Despite this it was very difficult for him to make friends and he would often avoid social interaction.

‘So, like myself and many others he turned to his computer and the internet for entertainment.

‘He loved to play video games and may have even been a bit addicted to them. He ended up meeting someone who he thought wanted to be his friend.

‘Soon a man began telling him that his parents hated him, and that God isn’t real, and that he shouldn’t go to church.

Friends of 14-year-old schoolboy Breck Bednar told yesterday how he would spend hours speaking to online ‘friends’ – often late at night – who he had never met in real life.

As they played videogames on the internet, they would use a computer program called Teamspeak 3 to chat to each other.

The software allows computer users to make free calls over the internet in a similar way to a conference call.

Users often wear a headset with an integrated microphone so they can talk as they play online with several other gamers. Private chat channels can also be set up by groups which are accessed by invitation only. Teamspeak is free to use but there is a fee if someone wants to block other users from joining in.

Breck is thought to have been a keen player of violent videogame Battlefield 4, which thousands of teenagers play online. Last night Hannah Broadbent, of online protection charity Childnet, said: ‘Young people should bear in mind that it’s not always easy to spot a groomer.

'Often they might be chatting about things you are interested in and you might not realise. You can never be completely sure that a person is who they say they are on the internet.

‘The most important thing is that young people can tell someone if someone makes them feel uncomfortable online.

‘And never meet up in person or share any personal information. If they are contacted by someone who makes them feel uncomfortable it’s important to report it.

‘It’s really important that we educate young people so they know how to navigate the risks.’

‘Breck became distant, stopped going to church and quit his extracurricular [activities] altogether.

‘They tried talking to him and helping him to no avail.

‘Two nights ago, Breck told his father that he was going to his friend’s house for a sleepover a couple of blocks away.

‘He ended up taking a train down to Essex, about two hours away to meet a man he had been talking to over the internet.

‘Early the next morning, the police found his body.’

Breck’s aunt Lisa Barth described the boy as ‘absolutely wonderful’ and said his death was a ‘senseless, disgusting tragedy’.

And Christopher Curtis, headmaster of St Bede’s School, a Christian comprehensive in Redhill, Surrey, where Breck went to school, said: ‘Breck was a bright and hard-working student who was a real pleasure to teach.

‘His tutor describes him as a model student. A conscientious young man with a great deal  of potential.’

'Murder': Breck Bednar is thought to have travelled from his home in Caterham, Surrey, to Grays, Essex

It is understood the schoolboy was part of a gaming group run by Daynes called FEP squad, which had around eight members, all thought to be around age 14, and some of whom had never met  in person.

Eventually almost all the members left and joined a different group, but Breck stayed.

Yesterday neighbours described how an ashen-faced teenage boy was led away from the Essex flat where Breck was found after arriving on Sunday night in a taxi.

They described Daynes as an ‘extremely quiet’ loner who moved into the property 18 months ago with the help of his grandparents, who paid for his rent and bills.

Chris Curtis, headteacher of St Bede's 
School where Breck was a pupil, said they had been devastated by the 'awful news' of the 
Year 10 pupil's death.

He added: 'Breck was a bright and hard working student who teachers describe as a real pleasure to teach.

'His tutor described him as a model student: a conscientious young man with a great deal of potential.

'We are deeply saddened by this tragic loss and our thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and with all affected.'

The schoolboy's 
family plans to establish a fund to support computer literacy in Breck's
 memory. Anyone wishing to contribute should email mma@gony.net
