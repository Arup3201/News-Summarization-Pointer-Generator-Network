The aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious is frequently on duty in far-off climes, but yesterday she could be spotted closer to home as she travelled up the Thames through London.

The ship is taking part in a series of events to mark the 70th anniversary of the climax of the Battle of the Atlantic, which ensured that essential supplies could reach Britain throughout the Second World War.

She is now visiting the capital for the final time before being decommissioned next year, in a move which will leave the UK without any active aircraft carriers for several years.

Final visit: Illustrious is making her last trip to London before being decommissioned next year, leaving the UK without an aircraft carrier

Illustrious was pictured going through the Thames Barrier and passing Canary Wharf before docking at Greenwich, the historical home of the British fleet.

The 22,000-tonne Royal Navy carrier, known as 'Lusty' by her crew, will be moored there until next week and will be open to visitors this weekend.

This month sees the 70th anniversary of 'Black May', the month which saw the heaviest fighting in the Battle of the Atlantic when the Allies took decisive control of crucial shipping routes.

The battle, which lasted for nearly the whole of the war, started with the Allies' naval blockade of Germany, which was met with a reaction from Nazi forces.

Event: The ship will be open to visitors over the weekend as the Royal Navy celebrates the 70th anniversary of the six-year-long battle

History: Illustrious has been in use since 1982, and will be decommissioned next year to be replaced eventually by HMS Queen Elizabeth

Winston Churchill described the Battle of the Atlantic as 'the dominating factor all through the war', as control of Atlantic shipping routes was central to the British war effort.

The naval blockade of Germany started the day after war was declared in September 1939, and did not officially end until VE Day in May 1945, after 35,000 Allied troops had been killed in the battle.

It saw the Royal Navy and the RAF, allied with U.S. forces, contend against German U-boats and the Luftwaffe to allow supplies and materials to reach Britain.

Fighting reached a peak in the spring of 1943, as the Allies took the upper hand thanks to new technology such as radar and longer-range aircraft.

Between March and May 1943, new 
technology allowed the British and American navies to turn the tide and 
they started destroying German U-boats in large numbers.

It gave the Allies the upper hand in 
the war as a whole, as Britain now had unfettered access to the 
materials needed for civilian and military industry.

The Royal Navy's anniversary celebrations are being held this month in Liverpool, London and Derry.

As well as visits from boats old and 
new, the cities will be hosting aircraft fly-pasts, while an academic 
conference and commemorative parade are being held in Liverpool.

Yesterday a service of commemoration for the 35,000 Allied troops killed in the Battle was held at St Paul's Cathedral.

HMS Illustrious was commissioned in 1982, and is now the Navy's only aircraft carrier in active service.

The ship first saw action in the South Atlantic in the aftermath of the Falklands War, and has since served in regions such as the Balkans and the Middle East.

After she is taken out of use in 2014, she will be preserved for the nation rather than being sold for scrap like her predecessors Invincible and Ark Royal.

The UK will then have no aircraft carriers at all until HMS Queen Elizabeth joins the fleet, probably in 2016.

Festivities: As well as the aircraft carrier's visit, a number of celebratory events are being held in London, Liverpool and Derry

Poignant: The Battle of the Atlantic lasted for nearly as long as the Second World War itself and saw a total of 35,000 Allied troops killed
