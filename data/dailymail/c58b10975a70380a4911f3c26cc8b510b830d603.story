Britain’s biggest energy suppliers have been criticised for keeping customer service callers on hold while answering calls to sales departments far quicker.

Researchers for consumer watchdogs Which? found that phone callers to customer services were kept waiting up to 11 minutes at the same time as sales calls were answered within 90 seconds.

The countrywide survey found that calling customer service at energy suppliers can be a frustratingly time-consuming chore yet sales callers are much less likely to be kept waiting for a reply.

Of 16 energy companies, 11 answered their sales lines faster than customer service phones on average

Which? reported: 'Need to ring your 
energy provider? Be prepared to wait, as it’s more likely to answer the 
phone quickly if you’re a sales call.'

Researchers
 from Which? made 384 calls to 16 different energy suppliers’ customer 
service and sales numbers, and found that 11 out of the 16 companies 
were, on average, slower to answer calls to their customer service lines than their sales lines.

'We
 wanted to see how long it took to speak to a human being and found that
 Npower and Scottish Power were among the worst,' says Which?.

'This is the third time we’ve found long wait times for Npower’s customer service.

In
 April 2013 Npower told us that its 17-minute waiting time was due to an
 abnormality; in October 2013 it said its 19-minute waiting time was 
because of high call volumes following reports of price increases,
 and this time it stated that its 11-minute waiting time was because it 
had just written to all of its customers asking them to contact Npower 
to discuss the best tariff for their needs.

The Which? report concluded: 'It's time for energy suppliers to start prioritising existing customers, providing them with high-quality customer service'

'When we asked Scottish Power to explain why it took over 11 minutes to answer
 a customer service call, but just under a minute and a half for a sales
 call, it stated: ‘We are always making improvements.’

'First
 Utility registered the longest waiting time for its sales number, due 
to ‘a prioritisation of existing customers at a time when there is a 
huge demand from new customers for our low-priced tariffs’.

'Our
 results prove that it is possible for energy suppliers to respond 
quickly to their customers, as - once again - Ebico had the fastest call
 response times.

'Customers were put straight through to a human, without any automated voice system.

'It’s
 time for energy suppliers to start prioritising their existing 
customers, providing them with high-quality customer service to help 
tackle the low levels of customer satisfaction and trust in the energy 
sector.'
