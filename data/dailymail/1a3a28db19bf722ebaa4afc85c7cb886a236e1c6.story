Demanding a correction: Albert Gifford, 15, from Shepton Mallet, Somerset, has taken on BMW over the use of a slogan used in a recent advert

A schoolboy who forced Tesco to change the wording on its orange juice cartons because of a grammatical error has now taken on BMW to challenge a slogan used in an advert.

Albert Gifford, 15, from Shepton Mallet, Somerset, has been engaged in a month-long 
email exchange with the motoring firm in a bid to alter a phrase in the new clip promoting the BMW 2 Series 
Coupe.

The advert, which was shown during a recent trip to the cinema with his family, ends with the slogan: 'it bites as bad as it barks'.

BMW staff say it is a play on 
words but the schoolboy insists the slogan should be corrected - because 
bad is not an adverb.

It follows a complaint he made to the supermarket giants in March.

He sparked a major rebrand after questioning their use of the phrase ‘most tastiest’, rather than ‘tastiest’ or ‘most tasty' on the packaging of Tesco-brand juice.

On May 19 Albert sent his first complaint to BMW via their website.

A customer service executive from the company responded two weeks later, saying they appreciated feedback and promised they would look into the matter.

The email also stated that the firm 'understood' Albert's frustration 'especially as it distracted his cinematic experience.'

Albert, who has now been informed the advert will not be changed despite his plea, told Mail Online: 'I
 can understand that they want to use short and snappy slogans in their 
campaigns, but a company like BMW should at least come up with something
 that is accurate.

'I was at the 
cinema with my family a few weeks ago to watch Godzilla and I noticed 
the trailer for the new 2 Series.

'I was frustrated because "bad" is not an adverb - as any semi-literate eight year old could tell you.

'A couple of weeks after I contacted them, I got fed up of waiting for them, so I emailed them again.'

'I also tried to get in contact with someone in the advertising department - but all they said was they had logged my complaint.'

Bad grammar? The slogan in question is used during a clip promoting the new BMW 2 Series Coupe

Wording: The schoolboy noticed the slogan at the end of the advert and told the multi-national company it spoiled the film for him

Ashley Parker, the BMW Customer Service Executive dealing with the complaint, said: 'It has been logged in our system and we have contacted our advertising department, but the advert is not going to change.

'This is the first time I have seen or heard of anything like this on the site.'

Albert is currently studying for his GCSEs and is preparing for his last exam on Friday - Further Maths.

The timing is frustrating for the schoolboy because the crucial test is the day after his school prom. 

Spotting the mistake: Albert, pictured when he challenged Tesco over the use of a phrase on a juice carton, said his strict attitude towards grammar comes from his parents

Next year he is starting at a sixth form college and has his sights on a career in medicine.

He added: 'I would like to go to a top university. Obviously I would love to go somewhere like Oxford or Cambridge, but have not decided yet.

'I have had about 20 exams so far and am predicted to an get A* in almost all of them.'

Albert
 believes his stringent attitude towards grammar comes from his parents. He even flags up mistakes in his classmates' work.

'My friends sometimes get frustrated when I look at their work, but some of them find it funny,' he said.

Standing firm: A customer services representative from BMW said they had logged Albert's complaint, but were not going to change the wording used in the advert

Albert's battle with BMW over their use of bad grammar follows a clash with Tesco over the wording on their juice cartons

The email exchange between Albert Gifford and Ashley Parker, a Customer Service Executive, began on May 19.

May 19 (written in query box on the BMW website)

Albert: 'I was at the cinema recently, watching Godzilla, when I saw an advert for the new BMW 2 Series Coupé. But the whole advert was ruined by the slogan “it bites as bad as it barks”. This is grammatically incorrect, as ‘bad’ is not an adverb, so cannot be used in this context.

'The word “badly” would be acceptable or even more exciting alternatives like 'fiercely'. It would also be correct to say “its bite is as bad as its bark”. I was distracted with it throughout Godzilla, and didn’t enjoy it fully.'

Hello,

I would like to point out that a response was promised to me regarding my grammar issue, and it has been a few days, under any definition of the phrase 'a few', as the email was sent on the 22nd of May and it is now the 3rd of June. The reference number for my comments is 1-18618938273 if that helps quicken the process.

Dear Mr Gifford

Thank you for your further email dated June 3, 2014. I am sorry to learn of your continued disappointment in relation to the phrasing which featured in the advertisement for the BMW 2 Series Coupé.

The advertisement for the BMW 2 Series Coupe is supported by the strap line, 'Bites as bad as it barks'. The way that this line is presented is deliberate as it draws its intelligence from playing on the well known phrase and duality of this being a BMW with an edge. During the advertisement you will hear the bark and so the ‘promise’ is what you would expect from such a bark which is the bite.

I thank you once again for providing us with your feedback. I trust that the information provided, clarifies our decision on the advertisement.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Parker,

Thank you for your response. It did indeed clarify why you chose the slogan, but I had already decoded the very intelligent reference to a well-known phrase. I would, however, like to point out that it is still grammatically incorrect.

The phrase you are referring to is 'its bark is worse than its bite', or 'it barks worse than it bites' in a few cases. I have never heard the word 'bad' used in this particular saying, but if it were, it would look something like 'its bark is more bad than its bark' or 'it barks more badly than it bites' (as you can see, these are hardly correct.) In no well-known saying is 'bad' used as an adverb. You can look it up in a dictionary if you like, and it will describe it as an ADJECTIVE (and maybe even a noun), which it is.

If the strap line draws its intelligence from the incorrect grammar using 'bad' as an adverb, in a 'promise' to viewers regarding the literacy rates at the BMW marketing department, I would of course have no quarrel with anything.

My kindest regards,

Albert Gifford

Dear Mr Parker,

By 'researched' I hope you mean that you have realised that the phrase is incorrect and it is imperative that it is changed. I hope your colleagues change the advertisement in the near future.

Thank you for your continued helpfulness throughout this matter.
