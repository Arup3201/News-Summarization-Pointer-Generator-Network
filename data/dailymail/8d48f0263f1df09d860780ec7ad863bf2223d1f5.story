Old favourite: Figures show more than 90 per cent of TV watched in the UK last year was viewed live

The British public's appetite for conventional TV viewing appears to have levelled out at four hours a day, new figures have revealed.

The average viewing figure last year was four hours and two minutes a day via the traditional method of watching programmes, live or recorded, on a TV set.

This was exactly the same as the record high figures from 2010, sparking suggestions that the steady growth in time spent watching the box has plateaued.

Thinkbox predicted that traditional TV viewing levels would now 'stabilise after a sustained period of record growth' - but accept that some of us may now be getting our fix via smartphone, laptop or tablet computer.

In addition, the increase in the number of adverts we are bombarded with has also slowed down.

According to research published by commercial TV marketing body Thinkbox, viewers were subjected to 47 adverts a day last year, up by one per day from the previous year.

The rapid increase of viewing in recent years has been fuelled by more homes getting digital TV which offers increased choice, easy to use digital video recorders such as Sky+ and popular commercial hits Downton Abbey and X Factor.

But the marketing body pointed out that the figures on levels of viewing, which are taken from audience measurement body Barb, do not include the viewing of TV on lap-tops, smartphones and tablet computers, which is increasing rapidly.

The organisation said data suggested that there is an additional 1.2 per cent of viewing via other devices, on top of normal TV sets.

Viewing figures from Barb show that we're each watching nearly 30 hours of TV a week and BBC1 remains a favourite

The figures revealed 90.6 per cent of the TV watched in the UK during 2011 was watched live and 9.4 per cent was watched on time-shifted viewing, which includes technology such as BBC iPlayer or Sky+, up from 7.6 per cent in 2010.

Sources suggested that it was wrong to think that the increase in traditional TV viewing would break records every year. It was also added that the increase of 'on-demand' services built into people's main TVs, would also help consolidate TV's viewing levels.

Lindsey Clay, from Thinkbox, said: 'It is obvious that people want to watch TV programmes on the best screen in the home if they can and 2012 will bring more opportunities to do that with the sale of connected TVs and more catch-up TV services to the TV set.

'And alongside that there is now a wide variety of personal screens to watch TV on which make TV even more convenient. Tablets are really delivering an excellent mobile TV experience.

'TV continues to be the most effective form of advertising.'
