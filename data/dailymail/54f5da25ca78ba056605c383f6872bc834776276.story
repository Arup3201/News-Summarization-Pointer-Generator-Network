Being the son of New York City's mayor may have some perks - but it doesn't get you out of shoveling snow on mom's orders.

Dante de Blasio, 16, spent Friday morning shoveling the path and sidewalk at his home in Park Slope, Brooklyn while mom Chirlane kept a close watch from the doorway.

His father, newly-appointed New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, had earlier closed schools after the city was hit with 7 inches of snow overnight on Thursday along with howling winds and freezing conditions.

The teenager was forced to scrape the path in front of TV cameras, dressed in sensible boots and a quilted jacket.

Mayor de Blasio, who held a press conference on Friday morning to discuss the city's efforts in dealing with the heavy snowfall, paid a brief mention to his son's efforts.

The mayor said: 'I'd give him an A for effort, and a D for punctuality.'

With regards his son's influence over calling a snow day, he added: 'If Dante didn't lobby me, there would be something wrong with him!'

On Thursday, Dante had been caught boasting to friends on Facebook that he was trying to persuade his father to call a snow day.

In a hilarious message leaked online by one of the 16-year-old's pals one day after his dad's inauguration, the teen is asked whether he can confirm if his dad is going to call school out because of the weather.

Answering back diplomatically at 
first that only the weather can decide, Dante then went on to say  he was bending his father's ear to call off 
school.

However, it 
seems that his mom, Chirlane McCray, may have been tipped off to her 
son's indiscreet chatting as she quickly posted her own social media 
message that suggested that if her boy was off-school it wouldn't be 
spent playing in the snow.

She posted a picture of a huge snow shovel and salts and the 
message: 'What Dante will be doing if he does not go to school 
tomorrow.'
