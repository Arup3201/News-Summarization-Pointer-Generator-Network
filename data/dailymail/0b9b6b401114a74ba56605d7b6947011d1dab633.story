A teacher has been struck off after uploading 'naked pictures' of celebrities on to a primary school computer by mistake.

Robert Adams, 52, 'accidentally' copied the images from his personal memory stick on to the main computer system at Deighton Primary School in Tredegar, South Wales.

They included 'full-frontal' pictures of celebrities, such as singer Miley Cyrus and actress Scarlett Johansson, a disciplinary hearing heard.

They were among 80 pornographic images of women - and one child abuse image of a girl aged around 15 - uncovered by police.

Adams, a former IT co-ordinator, has now been banned from teaching for five years after being found guilty of unacceptable professional misconduct by the General Teaching Council for Wales (GTCW).

He will be eligible to reapply to join the teaching register in 2019 - but it is not guaranteed he will be accepted.

The pornographic images were discovered after a nursery teacher at the school in Blaenau Gwent logged on to her class computer and came across a folder called 'Glam'.

She clicked on the folder to uncover an array of images of 'women with no clothes on', the hearing in Cardiff heard.

Officers later investigated the folder and discovered several nude photos of female celebrities, including French star Carla Bruni, singer Alicia Keys and actresses Helen Mirren and Isla Fisher.

Adams, former IT co-ordinator at the school, had found the images online on his home computer, before saving them on his memory stick, the hearing heard.

He claimed he had then accidentally copied them on to the school's computer while trying to download important files from the system during maintenance work.

Nursery teacher, Jayne Edwards, told the hearing she had been looking for classwork when she spotted the 'Glam' folder.

'I could see many thumbnail images in the folder and when I clicked on the first image I saw an adult female with no clothes on,' she said. 'In the next image I clicked on there were three females with no clothes on.

'Obviously I was shocked at what I had seen and went running around the school to find someone.'

The hearing was told every classroom in 
the school had a computer which both teachers and pupils could access through
 personal accounts with passwords.

Following the discovery in October 2009, Adams immediately handed his memory stick in to police and was suspended from the school with full pay.

Former headteacher, Roger Fawke, said the teacher had seemed 'quite concerned' that there was indecent material on the computer that children could access.Â 

'He is one of the best teachers I have ever come across and was a valued member of staff that I could trust to do the best for pupils,' he said.

Detetctive Constable Blair Jones carried out a forensic investigation Adams's memory stick, laptop and school computers.

He told the hearing the teacher had uploaded the 'Glam' folder on to the school system just before he took his class to a harvest festival at the local church.

He said evidence also showed Adams had accessed a similar pornographic file on his laptop later that night - and had deleted all files from his memory stick.

DC Jones said: 'When he handed in the memory stick to police the next day there appeared to be nothing on it - but forensic tools allowed us to see all the deleted files.'

He added: 'Mr Adams is the only person who truly knows how the "Glam" folder appeared on the school server.'

As well as the pornographic images of women, police discovered a video of the young girl - who appeared to be under 16 and partially clothed - in the recycle bin of Adams's laptop.

Steve Powell, chairing the GTCW panel, said the incident was a 'particularly serious' one of 'unacceptable professional conduct'.

'The child abuse image found is fundamentally incompatible with Mr Adams continuing to be a registered teacher,' he added.

Adams was investigated by police, but was not prosecuted.
