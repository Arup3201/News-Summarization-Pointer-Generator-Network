This Christmas was already gearing up to be the most fiercely fought battle between tablet makers, and now Carphone Warehouse has entered the fray.

The retailer has halved the price of its Android Avoca 7 tablet from £99 down to just £49 to compete with the likes of rivals Tesco and Argos against their respective budget devices.

It doesn't offer the same features as the more expensive models, but Carphone Warehouse claim it is 'perfect for families.'

Carphone Warehouse has halved the price of its Android Avoca 7 tablet, pictured, down from £99 in the run up to Christmas. It has a 7-inch screen, 8GB of internal storage and runs the Jelly Bean version of the Android operating system

The Avoca 7 comes with a 7-inch screen and has a limited amount of basic 8GB storage available - which can be increased up to 32GB using a Micro SD card.

This matches the storage on the Argos MyTablet but is half of all other major 7-inch tablet rivals.

Carphone Warehouse's tablet has a 1Ghz processor, 512MB RAM and a 0.3MP front facing camera.

The 350g tablet also runs Android 4.2 Jelly Bean software, which means it supports Android apps from the Google's Play store, and its makers claim it has a battery life of around eight hours.

Graham Stapleton, Carphone Warehouse's CEO said: 'We know over a third of tablet purchases
 are for children and family use but that one of the main barriers to 
not buying a tablet is cost.

'Our Android 7" tablet smashes 
right through the previous lowest priced tablets and is perfect for 
families and anyone wanting a modern, portable tablet at a bargain 
price.'

Since Google announced its 2013 Nexus 7 Asus-built device in July, there have been six 7-inch tablets launched from major retailers.

These range in quality and price from
 Carphone Warehouse's cheapest, up to Apple's £319 iPad mini with Retina
 display, announced on Tuesday.

It means this year's tablet wars in 
the run-up-to Christmas is set to be most competitive yet, and it's 
likely some of the older devices may become cheaper still nearer the 
time. 

Ed Connolly, buying director of 
electricals and home technology at John Lewis told MailOnline: 'Last 
year, tablets were the must-have technology product for the festive 
season, and we predict this year will be even bigger with tablets flying
 off the shelves at a rate of one every fifteen seconds this Christmas.

The Avoca 7 will compete against the 7-inch MyTablet from Argos, pictured, that costs £99.99. Argos announced the device earlier this month and said it is aimed at teenagers because it comes with parental controls enabled by default

Apple's CEO Tim Cook, pictured, announced the new iPad mini, right, as well as its fifth-generation iPad, called iPad Air left, on Tuesday that will compete in this year's festive tablet wars

'The competition is more intense than 
it's ever been, with sales of the latest Samsung, Google and Microsoft 
tablets up 80 per cent year-on-year.'

Argos' announcement last 
week that it was launching a budget device, called MyTablet, aimed at 
teenagers, was straight off the back of Tesco's Hudl announcement.

Tony Jiang, associate strategist at digital agency TH_NK said:

'The introduction of [cheaper 
tablets] undoubtedly opens up the tablet market to a much wider 
audience. Tablet technology is at a point where it's cheap enough to 
produce good quality, low cost devices and Tesco and Argos are looking 
to capitalise on that by selling them at a high volume to entry level 
users who may be using tablets for the first time.

'Whilst these budget tablets may not 
be able to compete with their more powerful counterparts from a 
performance perspective, they do perform suitably well for the casual 
user, and it's likely that their features will improve in new models 
over time without prices increasing.'

However, he warned that too many 
tablets at a similar price could split the market and users may choose 
devices based on what extra the company offers, such as Tesco's Blinkbox
 TV and film service.
