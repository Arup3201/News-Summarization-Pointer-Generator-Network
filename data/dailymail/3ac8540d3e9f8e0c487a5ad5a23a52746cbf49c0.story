Ex-NBA star Magic Johnson is taking the high-road after being called a bad example for youth by Donald Sterling.

Sterling, the 80-year-old owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, slammed Johnson in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper in which he was supposed to be apologizing for making racist comments. Instead, Sterling targeted Johnson, saying the NBA star isn't doing enough to help minorities and is a bad role model since he caught HIV.

Cooper gave Johnson the opportunity to respond to Sterling's statements in an interview Tuesday night in which Johnson says he's praying for the reviled team owner.

'I'm going to pray for the man because even if I see him today, I'm going to say hello to Donald and his wife as well,' Johnson said.

Taking the high road: Johnson was forgiving of Donald Sterling in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, after the disgraced Clippers owner called him a bad role model

'I'm not a guy who holds grudges and all that. Yes, am I upset? Of course! But at the same time, I'm a God fearing man and I'm going to pray for him and hope things work out for him.'

But Johnson also said that Sterling's behavior shouldn't be tolerated in the league and hopes the NBA's Board of Governors will work swiftly to force him out.

''The problem is he's living in
the stone age. He can’t make those comments about African Americans and Latinos,' he said.

As for the personal punches at himself, Johnson said Sterling is 'reaching' and looking for someone to take away the attention from his own problems.

Sterling made headlines last month when audio recordings were released of him telling his then-girlfriend V.Stiviano not to bring black people to her games.

Johnson was dragged into the scandal since Sterling was recorded admonishing Stiviano for posting a picture of herself with black Johnson on Instagram.

The disgraced Clippers owner spoke out for the first time since being banned from the NBA in the Monday interview, and apologzied for his racist comments before turning on Johnson.

Sterling first said the basketball legend was a ‘good person’ but his tone quickly changed and he made a series of disparaging remarks about Johnson's HIV-positive status, dismissing his work in charity and business and saying he's not a proper role model for children.

During the
 Tuesday interview, Johnson said he's tired of talking about Sterling, 
especially since he doesn't know V. Stiviano and 'barely' knows 
Sterling.

Johnson said Sterling should have apologized and 'just left it there'.

'Magic
 Johnson shouldn't have been included in your conversation because I 
have nothing to do with this but since your put me in it again and you 
want to try and disrespect me and the work I;ve done in the minority 
community - that makes me upset,' Johnson said.

Sterling started by apologizing for his racist comments, but as the interview progressed he blamed the media for blowing his words out of proportion before turning on Magic Johnson

Johnson also reacted to Sterling's ignorant comments about his HIV infection.

'Big Magic Johnson what has he done? ...he's got AIDS,' Sterling said Monday.

Anderson corrected Sterling, explaining that Johnson was diagnosed HIV-positive in 1991 but did not have 'full-blown AIDS.'

'What kind of a guy goes to every city, 
has sex with every girl, then he catches HIV. Is that someone we want to
 respect, and tell our kids about?' Sterling said. 'I think he should be
 ashamed of himself. I think he should go into the background'

In the Tuesday interview, Johnson said a large part of his foundation's work is to educate people like Donald Sterling who still don't know the difference between HIV and AIDS and fear those who have contracted the virus.

Not trying to steal Sterling's team: While Johnson said he would definitely make an offer on the Clippers if they came up for sale, he is more interested in owning the Lakers - his old team

Johnson also talked about the moment he came out as HIV positive in 1991, and how he has since raised over $15million dollars to assist patients through is foundation.

Sterling also told Anderson Cooper that Johnson called him up after the scandal and told him not to do anything and that he now believes it was a trick so Johnson could buy the team.

While Johnson says he would definitely attempt to buy the team if it comes up for sale in the future, the Clipppers aren't his dream team...and it was Sterling that called him.

'If i was going to trick somebody, deceive somebody, be dishonest to somebody, steal somebody's franchise... its going to be the Los Angeles Lakers. it wont be the LA Clippers,' Johnson joked.

Johnson said Sterling called him when he was scheduled to do an interview with Barbara Walters, asking Johnson to come on the interview with him and support him.

'I told him I wouldn't do it,' Johnson said.Ii said the number one thing you need to do which you haven't done is apologize to everybody and myself.'

Sterling ended up cancelling his appearance with Walters and estranged girlfriend Stiviano sat down instead for a solo talk.

Sterling went on to question Johnson's work giving back to impoverished African American communities.

'I mean what am I going to say? Has he done everything he can do to help minorities? I don't think so. But I’ll say it, he's great. But I don't think he's a good example for the children of Los Angeles.'

'Did he do any business? ... Did he help anybody in South L.A.? ... What does he do for the black people? Doesn't do anything.'

Sterling seemed unaware of the work that the basketball legend has done for over 20 years with his charity organization.Since he launched the Magic Jonson 
Foundation in 1991, the former basketball star has raised millions 
of dollars to underprivileged children and minority entrepreneurs.

'Jews, when they get successful, they will help their people,' Sterling said. 'Some of the African-Americans, they don’t want to help anyone.'

Johnson said he found it sad that Sterling was so clearly uninformed and unprepared for such an important interview.

'I wish he just knew the facts when he's talking but he's a man who's upset and he's reaching and he's looking for something to grab onto to save his team and its not going to happen,' Johnson said. 

When Cooper spoke about the accusations that Sterling had a 'plantation mentality', the 80-year-old said that the CNN presenter was more of a racist than he was

Sterling expressed the opinion that his Clippers players still love him and that he hopes to keep his team, an idea Johnson called 'delusional' in the Tuesday interview.

He says he
 doesn't believe the players or the fans want Sterling, or any of his 
family members, on team leadership and hopes the NBA's Board of 
Directors will act swiftly to push him out.

'I'm hoping they understand that we can't have this type of action in our league. We just can't have it.'

Following Sterling's interview, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver released a statement offering an apology on behalf of the 'NBA family'.

'I feel compelled on behalf of the NBA family to apologize to him that he continues to be dragged into this situation and be degraded by such a malicious and person attack. The NBA Board of Governors is continuing with its process to remove Mr Sterling as expenditiously as possible,' he said.

Johnson 
had tweeted after the recording emerged last month that he would never 
attend another Clippers game while Sterling was owner.

But he was in 
attendance at Sunday's playoff game against the Oklahoma City Thunder 
sitting next to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who handed down Sterling's
 lifetime ban and a $2.5 million fine nearly two weeks ago.

Johnson told Cooper that he changed his mind and decided to attend the game in order to support the Clippers players and Silver's decision.

At the conclusion of the interview, Johnson offered some advice to Sterling, telling the Clippers owner to sell his team and enjoy a retirement.
