In his role as Attorney General, he has spoken out repeatedly against the scourge of ‘petty hooliganism and anti-social behaviour’.

But it appears Dominic Grieve has not always practised what he now preaches.

The Government’s most senior law officer once threw a man off a bridge, it is claimed – and his alleged victim was none other than the current Police Minister, Damian Green.

'Undignified': It is claimed Britain's Attorney General Dominic Grieve, left, once hurled Police Minister Damian Green, right, from a bridge into the River Cherwell while they were both students at Oxford University

The story of the undignified incident from their Oxford student days resurfaced yesterday.

According to a 1977 report, politics student Mr Green ‘could have drowned’ after being hurled into the River Cherwell where he narrowly missed being impaled on a set of rusty spikes.

Among those in the group that propelled him from the 12ft stone bridge was said to be Mr Grieve, now a barrister and the country’s leading law officer. The two Tory MPs, both 56, now work together helping to shape UK policy on upholding law and order.

Yesterday neither politician was prepared to comment on whether the report was an accurate reflection on the events of December 1977.

But there would appear to be no residual animosity. When Mr Green was arrested in 2008, as part of a Home Office leaks investigation, it was Mr Grieve who rode to his aid by leading the public outcry.

At the time of the bridge incident, Mr Green was the 21-year-old president of the Oxford Union when he was ‘set upon by a bunch of Hooray Henrys’.

The story was unearthed by students working for Cherwell, the Oxford University newspaper. It appeared in the paper 35 years ago in a report co-authored by Michael Crick, who is now political correspondent for Channel 4 News.

He wrote: ‘Green was grabbed by about a dozen Magdalen undergraduates and some of their guests, and forcibly carried to the bridge over the Cherwell at the back of the College.

‘There, Green was dropped from a height of about 12ft into one-and-a-half feet of water.

‘In his fall, he missed being impaled on some rusty spikes by only a few inches.’

Mr Green reportedly told the paper: ‘I could easily have hit my head on the bottom, been concussed, and drowned.’ Six undergraduates accused of being involved had their membership of the student union suspended a few days later, and Mr Grieve was said to be among them.

The others were named at the time as being Nicholas Leviseur, Tim Clarke, Julian Chadwick, Simon Hardman-Lea and Gavin Grahame.

At the time Mr Leviseur threatened to sue Mr Green for slander over his version of events. Yesterday Mr Green’s constituency agent, Gordon Wiliams, said: ‘I had never heard of this story but Damian works harmoniously with Dominic Grieve so if anything did happen, it is all in the past now.’

The other members of the ‘Cherwell Six’ group allegedly involved in the incident all went on to glittering careers.

Mr Hardman-Lea is a leading consultant ophthalmologist, working at Ipswich Hospital, and Mr Chadwick is a lawyer and former chairman of Latin Mass Society.

Mr Clarke became CEO of pub chain Mitchell and Butlers. Last night he said at his £1million villa in Birmingham: ‘I just don’t want to get involved.’

Mr Leviseur, now a barrister at 3PB Chambers, yesterday told the Mail he had ‘no reliable memories of much that happened at university given that 35 years had elapsed since then’.

Last night a Home Office spokesman said: ‘This is not a Home Office issue.’
