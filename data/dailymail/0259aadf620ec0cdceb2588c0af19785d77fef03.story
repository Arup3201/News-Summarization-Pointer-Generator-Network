David Cameron yesterday tried to defend his decision to pose for a light-hearted ‘selfie’ in the middle of Nelson Mandela’s memorial service – by claiming he was only being polite.

The Prime Minister attempted to laugh off the storm of criticism he provoked after larking around with Barack Obama and Denmark’s prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt.

He joked he was being ‘polite’ by agreeing to pose for a picture with Miss Thorning-Schmidt, the glamorous daughter-in-law of former Labour leader Neil Kinnock.

The polite thing to do: David Cameron has defended posing for this selfie during Nelson Mandela's memorial service, saying it was proof the late leader was still 'bringing people together'

All smiles: Mr Cameron posed for the snap with Barack Obama and Danish leader Helle Thorning-Schmidt

Is that appropriate? Images of the three leaders taking the group photo prompted outrage online

Mr Cameron was challenged over the 
photo at Prime Minister’s Questions by Liberal Democrat MP Martin 
Horwood, who asked him: ‘Has the Prime Minister had the opportunity to 
discuss international mobile phone usage with any other European heads 
of government over the last day or so?’ 

To laughter from MPs, Mr 
Cameron replied: ‘You could say, in a roundabout way. Perhaps in my 
defence, you should always remember that the television cameras are 
always on.

‘But in my 
defence I would say that Nelson Mandela played an extraordinary role in 
his life and in his death in bringing people together.

'So of course when
 a member of the Kinnock family asked me for a photograph, I thought it 
was only polite to say yes.'

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also came to Mr Cameron's defence today.

Mr Cameron said he was just being polite in agreeing to the selfie, because he was asked by a member of the Kinnock family

The smartphone used in the selfie appears to be a BlackBerry Z10, the company's larger 4.2-inch touchscreen handset, which came out in March this year.

Judging by the way Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt is holding the camera, the snap would have been taken using the handset's front-facing 2MP camera - a high resolution for a front-facing lens, but not the best choice when taking a selfie with the leader of the free world.

The back lens offers a far superior quality - an 8MP camera complete with auto-focus and auto-stabilisation functions that would avoid any blur when focussing in on one of the three recognisable faces. 

Miss Thorning-Schmidt could have also zoomed in on the faces with the 3x digital zoom to really highlight the cheesy grins being shown off at the time.

After having taken the photo, she may have used the phone’s built-in camera app, or downloaded a selfie app such as TapCam Mirror, which would have let her add fun frames to the pictures.

Miss Thorning-Schmidt would have also been able to share the image instantly using her BlackBerry Messenger contacts on the BlackBerry 10 operating system.

Speaking on his radio phone-in on LBC 
97.3, Mr Clegg said: 'I know some people aren't happy about it. I think it was
 a bit of friendly light-hearted joking around by the three of them. I 
personally don't feel that people should be too censorious about it at 
all.'

He added: 'It was a 
very celebratory atmosphere, it was a real celebration of the man's 
life. There was dancing, there was singing, the crowd was in a very 
jubilant mood.

'So it wasn't as out of keeping with the setting as I think some people have suggested.'

A
 photo of the incident at Johannesburg’s FNB Stadium quickly went viral 
and featured on front pages on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday.

The
 New York Daily News described it as a ‘funeral faux-pas’, while a poll 
for the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet found that two-thirds of Danes 
felt posing for a jokey picture at a funeral was ‘inappropriate’.

The
 British political commentator Iain Martin said: ‘Why do Cameron and 
Obama feel the need to behave like idiots?’

Michelle Obama also appeared
 deeply unamused, staring stonily ahead while the three world leaders 
joked around.

In a comment on Twitter, the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan said: 
‘One person in that image retains her dignity – Michelle.’

The
 photograph provoked scathing criticism on social media, with many users
 saying it was inappropriate for world leaders to joke around at an 
event to mark the death of one of the great statesmen of the 20th 
century.

Twitter user James 
Armitage wrote: ‘What selfish morons take a “selfie” at a memorial 
service? Oh yeah that’s right, Barack Obama and David Cameron.’

In a 
message directed at Mr Cameron, Sarah McDermott said: ‘You have 
precisely zero class or decorum.’

Downing
 Street said the event was ‘a celebration of Mr Mandela’s life’ rather 
than a funeral.

AFP photographer Roberto Schmidt, who took the now 
infamous photograph of the three leaders, acknowledged they were 
‘messing about like kids instead of behaving with the mournful gravitas 
one might expect’.

But he 
defended their behaviour, saying he felt they were ‘simply acting like 
human beings’, given the ‘carnival atmosphere’ inside the stadium.

Tens of thousands of South Africans filed past Nelson Mandela’s 
embalmed body as he lay in state in Pretoria yesterday.

His body was 
surrounded by flowers, and dressed in one of his trademark colourful 
shirts.

Huge crowds began 
forming in the early hours of yesterday, with the line stretching 2km 
through the streets.

Many mourners waited for at least four hours in the
 baking sun.

Politicians, celebrities and Mr Mandela’s family had all paid their respects before the public were allowed in.

The
 group included Mr Mandela’s widow Graca Machel, his former wife Winnie,
 South African president Jacob Zuma, U2 singer Bono, Zimbabwean dictator
 Robert Mugabe and supermodel Naomi Campbell, who wiped away tears and 
had to be comforted after viewing Mr Mandela’s body.

Helle Thorning-Schmidt was previously
 given a warm welcome by David Cameron (below) when she visited Number 
10 on her first official to London as Danish Prime Minister in November 
2011.

As the 
daughter-in-law of former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, it was joked that a
 Kinnock had finally managed to get a foot inside Downing Street.

Her father-in-law famously lost to John Major's Conservatives in the 1992 general election after leading the polls for months.

While he blamed sustained personal attacks on him by the press, critics said voters were turned off by Labour’s tax plans and his premature triumphalism at a Sheffield party rally.

There had been fears that his son Stephen's wife could suffer from the same 'Kinnock curse' in the lead-up to polling day.

And indeed she was forced to dismiss allegations that she had separated from her husband and that he was gay right before her general election.

But it did not stop her sweeping to victory to become Denmark's first female Prime Minister in September 2011.

During her time in office, she has also visited Barack Obama at the White House in February last year.

Dubbed a 'Gucci diva' for her penchant for designer clothes, she led a 'Red bloc' of parties to oust centre-right Lars Loekke Rasmussen from office.

Miss Thorning-Schmidt, 46, gained a master's degree in political science from Copenhagen University in 1994. 

Two years later, she married Stephen Kinnock, 42, whom she met in Belgium.

They have two daughters - Johanna, 16, and Camilla, 13.
