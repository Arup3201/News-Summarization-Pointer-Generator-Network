As Liverpool chase fourth spot in the Premier League and another place at Europe's top table, Brendan Rodgers will be well aware of the improvement his side must make on the continent.

Thursday night's penalty shootout defeat by Besiktas in Istanbul ended their Europa League campaign at the first hurdle, just two-and-a-half months on from Champions League disappointment.

Rodgers' men were expected to make it through Group B along with Real Madrid but could only finish third behind Basel and Los Blancos after a series of underwhelming displays at home and abroad.

A drop into UEFA's secondary competition followed but Raheem Sterling and Co couldn't reproduce their domestic form at the Ataturk Stadium, falling to a 1-0 defeat on the night before exiting via spot-kicks.

The result completed what has been a miserable season in Europe for Rodgers, a manager whose lack of experience has told since the Reds' first nervy, narrow win at home to Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets in September.

The statistics make for grim reading - played eight, lost four, won two, drawn two and just six goals scored, two of which were penalties. Liverpool are flying domestically but in Europe it's been a different story.

After the aforementioned 2-1 victory at Anfield, everything went downhill. Home and away defeats by Real Madrid were to be expected to some extent, but failing to beat Ludogorets away and losing to Basel were unacceptable results.

The dominance of Carlo Ancelotti's men meant that Rodgers still had a chance to lead his side through to the last 16 on matchday six but again they faltered, only managing a 1-1 draw at home to the Swiss champions when they had to win.

They finished the group stage with just one victory, five points and five goals scored. After working so hard to end the club's Champions League absence, the players didn't do themselves justice.

Liverpool are the Premier League's form team, unbeaten in 11 matches and well in the hunt for fourth - or even third - place after a slow start to the season.

But with Arsenal, Manchester United and Southampton also battling for a place in the top four, winning the Europa League was an attractive way of qualifying for next season's Champions League.

A 1-0 home win against Besiktas kept that dream alive but a limp performance in Istanbul - the setting for that memorable victory over AC Milan in 2005 - meant that progression always looked unlikely, even with the unpredictable nature of penalty shootouts. 

Liverpool appear well-placed to earn a spot in Europe next season, but it'll be another disheartening experience if Rodgers can't get his players to take their league form to the continent.
