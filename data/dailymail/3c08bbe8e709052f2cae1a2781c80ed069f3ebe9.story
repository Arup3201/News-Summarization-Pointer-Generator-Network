The nearest I've come to handling an animal for dinner is stuffing a turkey for Christmas dinner.

So when posed with the question - would I butcher an animal to eat? - by a vegetarian, I answered yes, I would be able to slice and chop a rack of meat, without a care in the world. And now I had to prove it.

Brits eat an average of 84kg per person of meat annually - with chicken and and pork the most popular type that we consume. 

However, as more people are concerned with buying locally, and making sure animals are fed organically and reared humanely, there are more questions being asked how our food is sourced.

The writer with the pig she will section into five parts; tenderloin, ribs, spare ribs, belly and a leg

We are so used to eating on the go and grabbing convenience food, that it seems a slice of ham or a chicken nugget is no longer associated with animals being killed for us to eat.

As a carnivore, I'll happily eat bacon, ham, chops, pies and joints - and now I had to prove that I would be willing and able to carve it myself.

I hadn’t given much thought to how it went from a living, breathing creature to ending up on my plate until I went to The Shed Restaurant in Notting Hill to learn how to butcher a pig with some help from part-owner and head chef Oliver Gladwin. 

Oliver butchers all the meat in the restaurant himself – a fact he is justifiably proud of.

The 28-year-old trained at Leiths Cookery School and has worked in restaurants in London and as a head trainer at Devon’s River Cottage.

His passion and enthusiasm are infectious – my worries at tackling the task quickly fade as he assures me that I will be fine.

Elbow grease: Sawing through the rib of the pig was the toughest part of the process 

Oliver talks me through what we are going to do, explaining the process before he hands me two knives; one long blade which will slice through the meat in one swoop and another shorter knife to carve out the loin and smaller cuts.

First we tackle the fat. Using the small knife, Oliver shows me how to pull away the lard. Nothing we cut today will be wasted – he is a firm proponent of nose-to-tail eating; the lard can be used as dripping or to make roast potatoes.

Once the fat has been cleared, I have to pull out the tenderloin – a cut of meat that runs on the inside of the spinal column of the pig.

Oliver shows me what to do and watches closely as I slice through the meat. The knife is sharp and does quick work of this, gliding through it like butter, before I dig in deep and pull the meat away from the bone with my fingers.

The next step is to cut the flank off the ham (the leg of the pig). My aim is to get a long a belly as possible. I only use a knife to do this – not an axe or a saw as many butchers do - as Oliver does things the old-fashioned way, using traditional techniques he learnt from a butcher.

Using the animal’s weight to my advantage, my newly acquired knife skills come to the fore as I hack my way through the bone and then slice around the skin and tendon but not all the way through as I have to separate the leg from the torso by breaking it in one clean move.

Using my previous knife lines as a guide, I position myself at the back end of the pig while Oliver holds down the front.

Lifting the trotter with my fingers, it’s astonishingly heavy as I push it towards him. In one, swift move I push and with a cracking sound, the leg comes apart cleanly.

Snapping the leg off: After tracing an outline with her knife, the writer had to snap off the leg of the pig 

Task accomplished (from left to right): spare ribs, belly, tenderloin, ribs and leg 

Next up is to separate the torso of the pig. We count down five ribs and this time around I am more confident and slice through cleanly between the fifth and sixth rib.

The final step is to separate the loin from the belly. Making two marks on either end of the pig and running the blade of my knife from point A, where I will start, to the end goal, point B, where I will finish.

This is hard work and Oliver takes pity on me. An accomplished butcher, he wouldn’t use a saw but as it’s my first time, he offers me the alternative.

It’s a tough job this, tougher than the rest of the tasks. The pig is heavy, unyielding and I grapple with its weight. The saw slips from my fingers a couple of times but I persevere, brushing aside Oliver’s help. I want to do this, I want to see it through.

A primal feeling of joy courses through me as I successfully saw through the spare ribs. What I have in front of me now are five sections of the pig, which Oliver will use in his kitchen for the rest of the week.

We’ve cut tenderloin, ribs, spare ribs, belly and a leg, the latter which will be hung and used as ham.

Standing over my work, with a knife stuck into the pig, as if I've killed it, I feel a deep sense of respect for the animal. It’s a new found appreciation for what I have been thoughtlessly consuming on a daily basis.

So in answer to the vegetarian's question - would I be able to butcher an animal for my dinner - my answer is yes. What would yours be?
