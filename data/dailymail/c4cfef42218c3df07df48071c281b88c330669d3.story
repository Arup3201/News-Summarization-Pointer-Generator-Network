Investigation: Town councillor Bernard Borman is being investigated over claims that he called a motorist a 'smelly cow'

A politician once dubbed the real-life Victor Meldrew because he complained to councils so often is now being investigated himself over claims he called a motorist a 'smelly cow'.

Over the years Bernard Borman-Schreiber von Ullersdorf - a Prussian count - cost taxpayers £125,000 after he spawned 1,046 letters, faxes, and e-mails to and from his local council, who in the end gave him his own officer.

Such was his dissatisfaction with local government that he stood as a candidate and was elected as a town councillor in Leyburn in North Yorkshire.

But he is now facing a probe himself after a female motorist claims she was verbally abused by him after she parked across the street from his home.

The woman, who did not want to be named, said: 'I parked up where I wasn't blocking anyone's driveway on either side of the road.

'As I got out of my car I heard shouting from the opposite side of the road. I realised that a gentleman standing in front of gates across the road was shouting at me to move my car, which was actually parked well forward of his gates.

'I was absolutely shocked and appalled - amongst other expletives I was called a 'stupid cow' and a 'smelly cow''.

The councillor, who is better known as Bernard Borman, has said: 'Obviously, I regret it if I may have used inappropriate language.'

But councillor Borman has disputed the motorist's version of events.

He said: 'I politely asked the woman to move her car forward so that we could exit our driveway without complicated manoeuvres.

'It was she who started a shouting match and then refused to move her car.'

He added: 'I dare say that when one is confronted by rude and inconsiderate people, one may lose one's temper and say things which are not necessarily appropriate.

'I notice that the so-called lady failed to mention that she gave me two fingers and to distribute a story which is not accurate and to my detriment speaks for itself.

'Why could she not have moved a few feet further forward without causing an argument?'

The woman has denied making an offensive gesture or being rude to him.

Mr Borman achieved national fame in 2002 for being a serial complainer.

Richmond Borough Council had to hold a special meeting about the mountain of paperwork his letters, faxes and phone calls created for them, and calculated it cost them £125,000.

But Mr Borman said at the time: 'I eat, sleep and drink local authority laws. They're my hobby'. 

Then council chief executive Harry Tabiner said of his reputation: 'To compare this man to Victor Meldrew would be wrong. Some people sympathise with Mr Meldrew'.

The local authority even set aside an officer to deal with his correspondence, to which Mr Borman said at the time: 'I'm told I can only deal with an administration officer. It's an insult and I've written to complain.'

Leyburn Town Council, which he is now a member of, estimated his complaints and queries to them had cost them £7,000.

Today its chairman said his behaviour in the parking row had been 'unacceptable'. 

Chairman Trixie Walker said: 'We have to investigate it.  He has admitted he used inappropriate language and that was unacceptable for a councillor'.

On his reputation for complaining she said: 'Bernard is an articulate and intelligent man but he does get frustrated by bureaucracy'.

Mrs Walker added that she would be writing to him and warning him about his future behaviour. 

The incident was reported to North Yorkshire Police, although the force said it was not taking any action.
