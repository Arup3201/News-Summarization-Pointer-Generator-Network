His back flips and hair-raising stunts made him an internet sensation.

Cyclist clooked almost invincible as he launched his mountain bike across Edinburgh rooftops and jumped off cliffs in the Highlands.

But his latest video shows that the daredevil antics have exacted a heavy toll on his body.

Stunt rider: Danny MacAskill, 27, has suffered a series of injuries over the last two years after finding internet fame

The 27-year-old daredevil from Dunvegan, Skye, admits his injuries have left him struggling to walk and unable to ride his beloved bike for nearly two years.

He said: ‘I’m not really too sure exactly how I first sustained the back injury. It sort of reared its head in different ways, and in the most recent way it’s been affecting my knee, which has been a bit of a problem.

‘And when I start losing power in my leg, I’m not in control of the bike.

‘This last injury has been weighing me down. I’m missing my bike a lot. I’m a little bit frustrated at the moment.’

Mr MacAskill has suffered a number of setbacks since he rose to internet fame four years ago.

In 2009, he broke his collarbone three times in six months, once after tripping on a kerb in Edinburgh.

Now the first episode of new video series, Imaginate, shows him trying to cope with a serious back injury that has blighted his career.

The Red Bull-sponsored cyclist travelled to Newport, California, to start planning for the film.

He visited a specialist clinic which deals with other stuntmen who have had roles in films such as Superman and Rambo.

Doctors warned him his ability on the bike would be limited for the rest of his life if he did not have surgery. He hoped the operation would allow him to do stunts and tricks he had previously ‘dreamed of’.

His skills saw Mr MacAskill shoot to fame when he was filmed performing bike tricks during his lunch break.

More than 29million people have watched his leap from the roof of an Edinburgh bike shop across an alleyway to the neighbouring Copy Stop.

The clip prompted invitations to appear on talk shows and to perform at the Scottish Cup final – but MacAskill turned them down because he did not want to become famous.

However, he has appeared in adverts for Volkswagen, in a music video for the band Doves and on an advert for a job agency.

He was also invited to appear in the film, Premium Rush, starring Inception star Jordan Gordon Levitt.

US director David Koepp, who has worked on blockbusters including Spider-Man, Angels & Demons and Indiana Jones, asked Mr MacAskill to perform all the stunts in the movie after he saw his internet feats.

Last year, he returned home to perform a one-man act at Skye’s Agricultural Show in Portree.

He was there to prove that where he was born was no limit on his path to stardom.

In recognition of his achievements Mr MacAskill, also known as ‘Danny MegaSkill’, was last year shortlisted for National Geographic magazine’s People’s Choice Adventurer of the Year award.
