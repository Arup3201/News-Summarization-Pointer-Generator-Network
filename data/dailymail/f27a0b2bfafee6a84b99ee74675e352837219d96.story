Melbourne's Etihad Stadium is no stranger to huge crowds but on Saturday, there wasn't a single AFL fan in sight.

The venue played host to thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, who were attending a three-day holy conference called the International Convention.

Packing out the Docklands arena, more than 65,000 people from 60 countries attended the largest gathering of its kind in Australia.

Around 500 people were baptised during Saturday morning’s session, while others scheduled themselves in preacher training workshops, forums and sermons.

The event will continue through the weekend, and organisers are expecting a record breaking 70,000 delegates by Sunday.

The event is open to hundreds of different ethnic and language backgrounds from all around the world. 

Highlights will include two theatrical productions and a mass baptism as well as talks on how to reduce anxiety and the connection between family values and Jesus' teachings.

One reddit user, named speedyleedy took to the page to describe their reaction from visitors in Melbourne.

'I got asked for some directions by some American JWs yesterday, I started explaining and saw their faces, completely lost,' speedyleedy wrote.

'I just walked them there and had a quick chat. Found out that everyone had been really welcoming to them and a lot of randoms (not JWs) have really helped them enjoy their trip to Melbourne. 

'I explained some of my limited history of Melbourne and they were really greatful. Lovely bunch of people. 10/10 - would recommend.' 

The convention's theme this year, 'Keep Seeking First God's Kingdom' highlights how 'God's Kingdom' is benefiting people today.

The program marks 100 years since 'Jesus Christ began to rule as the King of God's Kingdom in 1914 

'People of many faiths pray for God’s Kingdom,' onlymelbourne.com.au wrote.

'As always, the event is free and all are welcome!' 

The program is live in five languages, which includes English, Auslan, Vietnamese, Korean and Chinese and simultaneously interpreted into 8 languages - Greek, Spanish, Italian, Croatian, Samoan, Arabic, Tagalog and Japanese. 

The conference celebrates the centenary of the group's belief that Jesus Christ began ruling over God's Kingdom
