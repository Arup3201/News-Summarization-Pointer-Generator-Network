A WOMAN has told how she was unrecognisable after an apparent reaction to her mobile phone cover left her face covered in a horrific rash.

Jenny Taylor noticed her face swelling up after fitting a soft silicone Griffin FlexGrip Punch cover to her iPhone 4.

The 30-year-old marketing manager developed the rash across her face and neck – with a ‘phone-shaped’ sore where she had held the handset to her ear.

Miss Taylor went to hospital when her own mother failed to recognise her, but was sent home with over-the-counter antihistamine tablets.

The next morning, however, her face had swelled so much she was unable to open her right eye and could barely swallow.

She returned to hospital where tests revealed she had developed 13 skin allergies.

Miss Taylor, from Kirby, Liverpool, has now been warned she is allergic to dozens of household items including jeans, coins and door handles.

She said: 'My neck looked like a roll of sausages and I knew I definitely needed to go back to the doctors.

'You could literally see the shape of where the phone had been on my face, lots of little spots came up in the same area.

'You could see a distinctive mobile phone shape, there was no question of what it was.

'My
mum didn’t recognise me at first, she gasped in shock when she saw me, 
she was appalled. She thought I’d stay like that forever.

The reaction also caused Mr Taylor's face to swell up just one week after using her iPhone 4 with a trendy new silicone case issued by Apple

The rash which covered Miss Taylor's face and neck swelled up and she said made her virtually unrecognisable

'When I saw a new doctor they examined my throat and they got concerned when they couldn’t see down there.

'I couldn’t swallow properly, so the doctors booked me in to another hospital and told me to go there straight away.'

Coins, belt buckles, and even mobile phones may also cause an unpleasant allergic reaction when they rub against the skin.

The reason is that they all contain nickel, the most common cause of skin contact allergies in the industrialised world.

Many millions of people know they have to avoid anything made with the metal - and now scientists understand why.

They have shown that nickel binds to a particular immune-system protein normally involved in detecting harmful invaders.

In susceptible people, this results in the body recognising nickel as an infectious agent and triggering inflammation.

As the immune system goes into overdrive, it produces the classic symptoms of burning, itching, redness, swelling and blisters.

After suffering the reaction in November Miss Taylor  was referred to the dermatology clinic at Royal Liverpool University Hospital, where she underwent 140 patch tests on her skin.

The tests, which normally identify a handful of allergies, showed up an incredible 13 on Miss Taylor's skin.

Doctors suggested her allergies could have been triggered by the silicone in her iPhone case.

Miss Taylor,
who lives with partner Chris Oswell, 32, said: 'The doctors said that 
just because I hadn’t had a reaction up to that point, it didn’t mean 
that I wouldn’t have one in the future.

'The doctors gave me advice like 
wearing gloves when I handle money, but I don’t do that as I’ve never 
had an issue with it before.

'But I’m super-careful and I do anything I can to avoid setting off my allergies.

'I'm going on a spa date with my 
boyfriend’s sister soon and stuff like that makes me really 
uncomfortable because you don’t know what goes on your body when you go 
to places like that.

'It’s really hard to get involved unless I take a few risks when I probably shouldn’t.

'Since
the incident with the phone case I've become a lot more sensitive to 
the sun - I used to tan really well but now I have to be really careful.

'And
then I have to be really careful in terms of what chemicals are used in
suntan lotions because I could have a reaction to that as well.

Miss Taylor, from Kirby, Liverpool, has now been warned she is allergic to dozens of household items including jeans, coins and door handles

'The last bad reaction I had was at Christmas last year when I had a reaction to some kind of make-up.

'I borrowed some off my mum, and it made my eye swell up so that I couldn’t see out of it.

'It was probably a stupid thing to do but I sometimes completely forget what I’m meant to be doing and what I’m not supposed to do.'

It also caused Jenny to come out in a rash if she came into contact with nickel and she is now allergic to coins, door handles and some make-up.

Miss Taylor bought the £16 cover through the Apple store.

She said: 'I've contacted both Apple and Griffin to warn them about my allergic reaction but I haven’t received any calls back or any letters.

'I just don’t want this to happen to anyone else because it's put my life on hold.'
