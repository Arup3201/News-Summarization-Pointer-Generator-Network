The TTP have vowed to avenge the death of Osama bin Laden by targeting 10 places in America, the UK and France

The Taliban has issued a chilling threat to carry out a series of attacks against 10 targets in Britain, American and France to avenge the death of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.            

'Soon you will see attacks against America and Nato countries, and our first priorities in Europe will be France and Britain,' deputy Pakistani Taliban leader Wali-ur-Rehman said in a videotape aired on Al Arabiya over the weekend.    

The Tehrik-e-Taliban (TTP), or Taliban Movement of Pakistan,  which swears allegiance to Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar, is blamed for many of the suicide bombings across the country and remains highly dangerous despite a series of army offensives against its strongholds in the north-west of the country, on the Afghan border.

It has not demonstrated an ability to stage sophisticated attacks in the West, however, and the TTP's one apparent bid to inflict carnage in the U.S. failed.

The group claimed responsibility for the botched car bomb attack in New York's Times Square last year.

But American intelligence agencies 
take it seriously. It was later added to the country's list of foreign 
terrorist organisations.

The video showed Rehman, described as more sober and experienced than other TTP leaders, flanked by armed followers walking through rough mountain terrain.

He sits on a blanket beside a sniper's rifle on a hilltop and explains the TTP's plans. 

He said: 'We selected 10 targets to avenge the death of bin Laden.'

Deputy Pakistani Taliban leader Wali-ur-Rehman made the threats in a video which aired over the weekend

Attack: Labourers clean the Police Station which was stormed by the armed Taliban militants in Kolachi, a town of volatile Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan

Rehman, also seen firing a machine gun into the distance in the video, did not elaborate.     

But he said the first revenge operation was the Taliban siege of a Pakistani naval base in Karachi last month - one of several setbacks the military has suffered since U.S. special forces killed bin Laden on Pakistani soil on May 2.   

The TTP regards the Pakistan army as a U.S. puppet and it has kept the government on the defensive since bin Laden's death, staging suicide bombings, large-scale attacks on security forces with large numbers of fighters, and employing new tactics. 

A Taliban militant and his wife carried out a weekend shooting and suicide bombing on a police station that killed 12 policemen.

Britain confirmed yesterday that it is withdrawing 18 military trainers, who had been working with an anti-Taliban unit in Pakistan, amid ‘security concerns’.

It was unclear whether the move is linked to the latest threat.

The United States has been leaning hard on Pakistan to crack down on militancy since it was discovered that bin Laden may have been living in the country for years.

More Pakistani cooperation is needed as Washington seeks to wind down their war effiorts in Afghanistan and defeat Al Qaeda, and its allies.

But Pakistan's generals are furious because the United States kept them in the dark over the bin Laden raid

The Pakistani and Afghan Taliban move easily across the porous frontier and provide each other with shelter and intelligence, complicating efforts to root out militancy in the region U.S. President Barack Obama has described as 'the most dangerous place in the world'.
