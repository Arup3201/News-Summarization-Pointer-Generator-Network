Betty Yates was found dead at her home in the picturesque town of Bewdley, in Worcestershire, which sits on the River Severn

Retired teacher Betty Yates, 77, who was found murdered in her cottage had been 'stabbed in the neck', an inquest revealed today.

Mrs Yates' body was found at the foot of her stairs at the house down an isolated track in Bewdley, Worcestershire, after a friend who could not contact her called the police.

Officers went to the cottage, which overlooks the River Severn, on January 4 where they discovered the widow's body.

The inquest at Worcestershire Coroners Court heard that a post mortem examination determined Mrs Yates died from stab wounds to the neck.

Coroner Geraint Williams released the body of Mrs Yates, who was born in Birmingham, back to her family for a funeral service. The court heard she is to be cremated.

The inquest hearing has been adjourned until March 1 for further inquiries to be made and where the progress of the case will be reviewed.

Mrs Yates is 
believed to have been killed sometime between Monday, January 2, and Wednesday, January 4.

Police are investigating whether Mrs Yates was stabbed after disturbing a burglar at her home.

On
Saturday, a contributor to a memorial page on Facebook suggested she was
killed by an attacker who believed the cottage, called Riverscroft, was
empty.

In a post full of 
grammatical errors, someone calling herself Katie Eldridge wrote: ‘She 
wasnt meant 2 b home, the lad panikd and stabd her cus she told them off
4 bein in her house. It was meant 2 b a clean sweep but she was home, 
she didn’t stand a chance.’

Police said they were investigating the posting, which was quickly removed.

Neighbours described Mrs Yates as a ‘feisty’ woman who would ‘put up a good fight’.

One local told how a friend had reported seeing a man wearing a red 
hooded top running away from the house early last week.

Another resident told the Daily Mail 
he had seen a man walking through the Riverside Caravan Park near Mrs 
Yates’s home on New Year’s Eve.

Around
ten minutes later, he saw the stranger, who he said was aged around 40,
getting into a silver VW Golf GTI in Bewdley town centre.

West Mercia Police said reports of the two men seen in the area would be investigated by detectives.

In
a statement on Saturday, Mrs Yates’s children, Hazel, 53, and David, 
51, described their mother as ‘vivacious, independent’ and a ‘true 
lady’.

They said ‘quality 
time’ spent with her over Christmas represented their ‘final, treasured 
memories’ of her and urged anybody with information to contact police.

More
than 70 people gathered to pay their respects in a candlelit vigil near a police cordon 
around Mrs Yates' isolated home on Sunday night.

A former pupil,  Hayley Williams, 38, who was taught by Mrs Yates in the 
mid-1980s, described her as an ‘amazing’ teacher who was widely loved.

Miss
Williams added: ‘She taught everybody, whether they were in her class 
or not. She had this unique way of teaching and for whatever  reason it 
worked.’

Pat Brown, a friend of Mrs Yates who 
often went swimming with her at a local hotel, described her as a 
fantastic person whose popularity could be judged by the large turn-out 
at the vigil.

‘She was always happy, always smiling and always helpful,’ said Mrs Brown.

Mrs Yates was well known locally for her involvement in book and walking clubs.

Other friends told how Mrs Yates loved being at the cottage, where she had lived for more than 30 years.
