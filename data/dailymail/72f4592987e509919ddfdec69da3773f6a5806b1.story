Flares may never be back in fashion, but with a little help from a 1970s film icon, Qantas are about to take off on a nostalgia trip.   

The flag carrier airline of Australia unveiled their newest boeing 737-800 aircraft on Monday but with a retro-themed 70s livery, as a tribute to 70 years of the iconic flying kangaroo logo.

And who better to take a journey down 1970s memory lane with than Travolta, who is also a Qantas ambassador and massive aviation 

aficionado. He even stepped out in his Qantas uniform at the event in Seattle, Washington.

News.com.au reported that standing beneath a giant mirror ball dangling from the Boeing hangar, Travolta quipped to guests and the media: “I don’t know whether to do an Aboriginal dance or a disco dance!”

After stepping out of the Qantas plane, he walked down a red carpet with two Qantas air hostesses dressed in original Pucci uniforms from the 70s. Aussie DJ Grant Smilie blasted Elton John's Rocket Man through the Boeing Hangar as the new plane was revealed.

Travolta later told news.com.au that the retro livery had particular significance to him and his career. When he took his first flight to Australia in 1980 it was on a Qantas 747SP in this colour. 

'It was at the peak of my arrival in film and television,' Travolta explained. 'I’d been famous for about five years but it was my first big international trip to Australia, and I was excited, I was going to meet Olivia (Newton-John) there and she was going to take me to her house. 

'I was there to promote Urban Cowboy, the movie, so my memories of this time-frame of livery are exciting, it represents a lot for me.’

The legendary Ochre colouring that reflected the colours of the outback where Qantas was established in 1920

The plane is the 75th Boeing 737 aircraft in its fleet, and will fly throughout Australia when it arrives in Sydney on Wednesday. The aircraft will operate across all domestic routes from November 20, and it will no doubt bring back many happy memories for passengers. The livery is also timed to mark Qantas’ 94th birthday this month.

The signature element of the 1971-1984 livery design was the ochre band around the window line of the aircraft. Ochre reflected the colours of the outback where Qantas was established in 1920.

The winged kangaroo logo is used on the tail and was adapted from the original 1947 version designed by Gert Sellheim.

Qantas ambassador John Travolta was the ideal man to honour the 1970s and the airline's retro look

In 1984 the flying kangaroo discarded its wings, evolving to its current slender and stylised form. Qantas’ Chief Financial Officer, Gareth Evans, said the livery signifies the airline’s outback roots.

'It’s a livery that will be familiar to Australians because the 70s and 80s saw Qantas become a truly global airline,' he said. 'It was a new era where long haul travel became a realistic aspiration for ordinary Australians. Millions of Australians experienced this overseas travel for the first time on a Qantas aircraft painted in this iconic design.'
