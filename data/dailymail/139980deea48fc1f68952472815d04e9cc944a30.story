Eight months after begging the public for any information that could lead to finding his wife's killers, Kassim Alhimidi himself was arrested and charged with the homicide.

Police arrested Alhimidi, 48, of El Cajon, Calif., Thursday for 
the murder of his 32-year-old wife, Shaima Alawadi, according to ABC News affiliate KGO.

Alawadi's family called her death a hate crime after she was found 
beaten with a tire iron in her living room with a note calling her 'a terrorist.'

He is charged with first degree murder.

The death of the mother of five sent shockwaves through El Cajon, which is home to one of the 
nation's largest concentrations of Iraqi immigrants.

Shortly after the homicide, Alhimidi was in court making emotional pleas to his wife's 'killer' and begging for information.

This past March as his 15-year-old son Mohammed translated from Arabic, Alhimidi said: 'The main question we would like to ask is what are you getting out of this and why did you do it?'

He was addressing reporters at a mosque east of San Diego after her memorial service.

She was found unconscious by her teenage daughter in the dining room of the family home in El Cajon, one of the nation's largest enclaves of Iraqi immigrants.

Fatima Al Himidi,Â  17, told a television station that the note said: 'Go back to your country, you terrorist.'

At the time, Alhidi claimed he was out of the house at the time of the attack.

El Cajon police said the note found next to her body initially led investigators to regard the killing as a possible hate crime.

Chief James Redman said there was other evidence and called the killing an isolated incident.

The family also told police they had found a similar note earlier this month but did not report it to authorities.

However, search warrants viewed by KGO revealed that divorce papers had been found in Alawadi's car  but had not been filled out.

The
 victim and her family left Iraq in the early 1990s after a failed 
Shiite uprising, living in Saudi Arabian refugee camps before coming to 
the U.S. Saddam Hussain's troops hanged Mrs Alawadi's uncle.

The family arrived in the Detroit, Michigan, area in 1993 and had moved to San Diego only shortly before the murder.

Alawadi was a religious Shiite Muslim who wore a hijab; her father Sayed Nabeel Alawadi is a cleric in Iraq.

The victim's body was taken to San Diego airport and is now in Najaf, Iraq.

He is scheduled to be arraigned Nov. 13.
