The video, which is believed to have been shot by a fellow prisoner about three weeks ago, provides an insight into the daily lives of prisoners at the Indonesian jail, as the inmate is filmed asking Chan if he wants to play a match of tennis later. Chan replies 'I'll be around'.

It comes as dozens of Indonesian soldiers were photographed rowing to Nusa Kambangan, also known as Death island, where the executions of Chan, Sukumaran and eight other Indonesian and foreign prisoners, will take place.

They are understood to be making their way to the location in order to prepare for the execution and transfer which will make use of about 1,000 soldiers and a firing squad of 120 police, The Jakarta Post reports.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo reaffirmed his commitment that the death penalty would be imposed on the two Australians.

'Our position is clear, our laws can't be interfered with,' he said,  Kontan reports.

The remark comes after Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott called Mr Joko earlier this week to make another appeal for the mens' lives to be spared.

Although a date is yet to be set for their execution, authorities have confirmed that arrangements for their transfer have now been finalised and could take place as early as Sunday, the Daily Telegraph reports.

Police mobile brigade (Brimob) commander Rudy Harianto, who invited the media to a simulation of their transfer from jail to the airport in armoured vehicles, told The Sydney Morning Herald they 'are ready at any given time' and is confident that prisoners 'will not be able to escape'.

The Bali Nine pair remain in Kerobokan jail awaiting the warden's signal that it's time to go to Nusakambangan after the move was postponed last week because the island was not ready.

Central Java Provincial Law and Human Rights Office head Mirza Zulkarnaen says new isolation cells are now ready, although other arrangements are not complete. 

Authorities plan to hold the Australians and eight others in Besi prison before they meet their end in front of a firing squad. 

Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has not named all 10 prisoners to face the firing squad, but 10 drug offenders are on death row. 

President Joko Widodo wants to deny all death row drug offenders clemency, believing it's a good shock tactic in the war against narcotics.
