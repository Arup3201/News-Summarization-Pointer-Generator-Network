Pippa Middleton let her hair down as she enjoyed a night on the town with friends. The 29-year-old visited Lou Lou's in London's Mayfair, and appeared to be in high spirits despite the notable absence of her boyfriend Nico Jackson, 35.

Fortunately for Pippa, she had another handsome male to lean on, resting her head on banker Tom Kingston, 34, as they left in a taxi at  at 2.30am.

The private members' club is a favourite place to party for Pippa who smiled and giggled as she left the club last night to take a taxi home along with her companions.

Pippa, who will become an aunty in July, was seen pulling out her mobile phone in the taxi and talking
 animatedly into on speaker so she didn't have to hold it to her ear.

Perhaps
 she was calling boyfriend Nico Jackson, who wasn't
 pictured with her at Lou Lou's.

Pippa couldn't be missed  in her baggy, 
bright pink Aztec-print trousers.

er choice of outfit proves she's a 
dedicated follower of fashion with Stella McCartney, Matthew Williamson 
and Alexander McQueen just some of the designers including loud print 
pants in their Autumn/Winter 13 collections.

Pippa's were from Temperley London, a favourite brand of her and her sister Kate. Perhaps in a nod to her royal connection, the pants are called 'Sovereign Silk Trousers' and cost £295.

The designers say the trousers as are 'inspired by Ballet Russes costumes 
from the early 1900’s and made of soft crepe-de-chine, the ikat style 
print is graphic and eye catching.'

Pippa teamed her trousers with black top, beige jacket and long gold necklace. She carried a clutch bag - a fashion accessory championed by her sister the Duchess of Cambridge.

Iconic handbag designer Lulu Guinness said she was planning to make clutch bags smaller next season because of the 'Kate effect.'

Following the publication of her book Celebrate, Pippa's latest project involves writing a column for Waitrose magazine.

So far she has advised readers on how to make sushi for dinner parties and how to have the perfect Provence picnic.

Pippa accessorised last night with a gold necklace from Kinnari.com.

Shoppers can design their own jewellery on the website by choosing what base, metal, size and gem stones they would like.

Pippa choose a weave egg medium basket pendant in 14ct gold vermeil with white topaz rough gemstones inside the basket and blue sapphires scattered on the outside, pictured right.

She wore it on a 34 inch gold chain.
