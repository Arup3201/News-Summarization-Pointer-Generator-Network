Warning: Nigel Farage, who stands by comments he made to Right-wing U.S. radio host Alex Jones that EU leaders could be overthrown in a 'revolution'

Nigel Farage was at the centre of a row last night after appearing to suggest ‘violence’ could be justified to overthrow Brussels bureaucrats.

The Ukip leader warned that the EU was heading for ‘revolution’ and said violent protest could be the only way for southern European nations to save their democracies.

He also compared ‘emergency powers’ adopted by EU leaders during the euro crisis to Adolf Hitler’s suspension of democracy in 1930s Germany.

His remarks came in interviews with controversial US Right-wing radio host Alex Jones.

They were broadcast last year and little-noticed at the time but are still available online.

Speaking against the backdrop of massive public protests in Greece over being forced by Brussels to implement huge spending cuts, Mr Farage said the way southern European nations were ordered around was ‘a recipe for revolution’.

He added: ‘I see the suffering of people in the Mediterranean reaching a real crisis point and I think the danger that Southern Europe faces is there could be a spark and that spark could lead  to something akin to violent revolution.

'The whip hand is now so firmly with the bureaucrats – they hold all the cards – that possibly violence is the only way out of this.’

Last night, Mr Farage stood by his remarks and denied they were inflammatory.

He said the ‘last thing’ he wanted was people resorting to violence but insisted: ‘As far as the Mediterranean is concerned, I think it will be a violent end.’

Pro-European Tory MP Robert Buckland condemned Mr Farage’s remarks as ‘completely unacceptable’.
