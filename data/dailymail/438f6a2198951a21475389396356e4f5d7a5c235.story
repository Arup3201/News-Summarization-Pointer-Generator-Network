There was a telling moment on Wednesday when Stuart Lancaster encapsulated England’s philosophy by invoking the memory of the country’s iconic World Cup-winning No 10.

‘To be the best, it’s not about the flash stuff, it’s about skill, execution and everything being done at a very high level,’ said Lancaster. ‘If we take Jonny Wilkinson as the benchmark, he didn’t get everything right all the time and it wasn’t always flash, but he was incredibly consistent in everything he did.’

His answer came after Danny Cipriani was left out of the 33-man squad for the QBE Test series next month, as exclusively revealed by Sportsmail nine days ago.

Forwards: J Marler (Harlequins), M Mullan (Wasps), K Brookes (Newcastle), D Wilson (Bath), D Hartley (Northampton), R Webber (Bath), D Attwood (Bath), G Kruis (Saracens), J Launchbury (Wasps), C Lawes (Northampton), C Clark (Northampton), J Haskell (Wasps), B Morgan (Gloucester), C Robshaw (Harlequins, capt), B Vunipola (Saracens), T Wood (Northampton).

Backs: D Care (Harlequins), L Dickson (Northampton), B Youngs (Leicester), O Farrell (Saracens), G Ford (Bath), S Myler (Northampton), B Barritt (Saracens), L Burrell (Northampton), K Eastmond (Bath), J Joseph (Bath), B Twelvetrees (Gloucester), M Brown (Harlequins), A Goode (Saracens), J May (Gloucester), J Nowell (Exeter), S Rokoduguni (Bath), M Yarde (Harlequins).

Countless observers, this one included, believe the Sale fly-half has greater match-winning credentials than Stephen Myler, who has been picked as one of the three stand-offs. Those on the outside crave dashes of magic to ignite England’s attack, but the men in charge focus on the sum of several often earthy parts.

Lancaster said: ‘Game management is one of the key things we look for in our fly-halves. Ability to execute an accurate kicking game, so you relieve pressure; if you’re in the middle of the field, you kick or run.

‘If I talk about taking the ball to the line and creating line breaks for other people, I think you look at George Ford. Goal-kicking is a key area. Stephen Myler probably tops the stats — his kicking has been very, very good. Then there’s defence, the ability to stop opponents on the gain line. These are all parts of the jigsaw.

‘There’s a package that we need to see, not just from him (Cipriani) but from all the players. Some players have had stand-out games but it’s about backing that up with another and another, not having a stand-out game then being seven out of 10. It needs to be nine out of 10.’

Yet, the criteria are seemingly applied to some players, but not all. Of the various fly-half candidates, Owen Farrell is the one without much game time or any really encouraging form this season. He, though, is regarded as a man apart. Provided he is fit, he will surely play, but his lack of momentum is a concern, whatever the official line.

Based on Lancaster’s explanations, the England coaches are certainly not indulging in selection by basic hunch or taking wild risks. There is an onus on ‘objective data’ and a scientific study of all-round credentials. The siren call of public or media opinion is blocked out.

The theme of consistent execution trumping bursts of ‘flash’ quality was evident again when the focus turned to the troublesome wing positions. Chris Ashton deserves to be in based on form for Saracens but he has been reasonably jettisoned because of concerns about his consistence and all-round game. The tries keep coming, but at Test level other aspects of his game have been exposed.

Christian Wade of Wasps scored a stunning solo try in Dublin last Sunday and a more emotive management team would perhaps have taken a punt on him. But while the Lion has the flash factor, he lacks consistency of execution.

The same principles are being applied in midfield and to Chris Robshaw’s continued status as first-choice captain and openside flanker. His place has been questioned amid acclaim for James Haskell’s form and speculation about a Steffon Armitage return. But he fits in with the current preference for grafters rather than dazzlers, and the fact remains that a back row of Tom Wood, Robshaw and Ben Morgan led a demolition of the All Blacks founded on ferocious and effective work at the ruck.

That back row, or Billy Vunipola at No 8 ahead of Ben Morgan, has complementary assets. Haskell is breathing down the necks of the flankers, as is the returning Calum Clark, and this is an area of English strength, even without Armitage.

The same can’t be said for midfield. Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell were the chosen pair in last season’s Six Nations but Lancaster’s comments on Wednesday pointed to the possibility of Kyle Eastmond and Brad Barritt joining forces next month. Whatever decision is made, in the enforced absence of Manu Tuilagi there needs to be a thread of continuity at centre. Ideally, a combination will be backed throughout the four-match series.

All the attention is on those places where the names are in pencil rather than ink. By and large, England are well placed, with good depth and a vast array of options. But the suitable time for trying newcomers such as Semesa Rokoduguni and George Kruis is surely nearing an end. By the end of November, more certainty is required.
