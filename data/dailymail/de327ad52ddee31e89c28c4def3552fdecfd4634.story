Luis Suarez has revealed he was only 50 per cent fit when he broke English hearts with two goals for Uruguay in their 2-1 World Cup victory - and that Roy Hodgson's refusal to label him a 'world-class striker' gave him added motivation.

England are teetering on the brink of a group stage exit in Brazil after Suarez's brace left them bottom of Group D without a win from two matches.

And the Liverpool striker says that Hodgson's refusal to label him in the same bracket as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo following England's loss to Italy last week, coupled with constant talk of his knee injury, inspired his performance.

Hogdson said that Suarez would 'only be at that level' once he performed at a World Cup, something he made sure he did against England.

Suarez told Uruguayan website Tenfield: 'It wasn’t revenge, but in England they talked about the injury and the coach had words that annoyed (me).'

The 27-year-old forward's involvement in the World Cup had been in doubt since he underwent a knee operation five weeks ago, leaving the hospital in a wheelchair.

He was also forced to sit on the bench as Uruguay were humbled 3-1 by Costa Rica in their opening Group D match.

But Suarez was back fit to face England and scored an opportunistic header to put Uruguay 1-0 up, before winning the game after capitalising on Steven Gerrard's misdirected header and smashing home.

Amazingly, Suarez says he was only half-fit for the match.

He said: ‘I was probably only 50 per cent fit - but it is due to the work of all the fantastic doctors and physiotherapist that I was able to be 50 per cent ready - and I am thankful that that was enough to beat England.

‘I have some more days to get ready for the next game now - and the more I train the sharper and more ready I will be.

‘It was a fantastic result - but it is not the job done. We need to make sure we go and get the right result against Italy - and then if we progress out of the group we can start to dream about what is possible.'

Suarez celebrated his first goal by running to the touchline and hugging team physio Walter Ferreira, who helped with his recovery.

'My wife and my two children are important to me and Walter is also important, the goals were for him because of what he did for me,' Suarez said.

'I have to thank him. I scored the goals, but he is the man responsible for them.'

Despite their victory over England, Uruguay still face the possibility of an early exit along with Hodgson's men.

Their final Group D match is against Italy on Tuesday and Suarez knows they need to win to give themselves the best possible chance of progressing.

He said: 'This victory is very important, it is crucial.

'It was a difficult match against a difficult rival. England are a strong team.

'But we have not qualified, we have to keep our feet on the ground.'
