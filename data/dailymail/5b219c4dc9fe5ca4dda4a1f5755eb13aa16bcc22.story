Over: Jessie J has quit The Voice UK to focus on her new album and world tour

Jessie J has quit as judge on The Voice UK after two
series of the show, causing another blow to the BBC talent competition after dwindling viewing figures.

The singer confirmed the news on Twitter, stating that the promotion of her new album must 'take priority.'

'I've absolutely loved my time on The
Voice and I hope everyone saw and knows how passionately I felt about the show. However, I can't wait to promote my new record around
the world and that has to take priority,' Jessie, 25, wrote on Friday.

The Price Tag singer went on to say: ' I shall be keeping a very close eye on
series three, showing my support in every way I can, and really hope that in
some way that I can be part of the show.'

Audience figures for the second 
series failed to match those of the first run in 2012, however during 
the final month of the show, they increased just as disabled contestant 
Andrea Begley was crowned the winner.

But will.i.am voiced his concern over
the result, tweeting after the final: 'Andrea is amazing... 
#dontGETmeWRONG...but we know who has the incredible #voice'.

His act Leah McFall was the bookies' favourite, however she didn't have the public's backing in the end, despite achieving four top 30 hits in the iTunes chart prior to the final.

Now Jessie will be leaving behind Tom Jones, Danny O'Donoghue and Will on the judging panel, but there is no guarantee the other celebrity coaches will not follow suit.

In the past the judges have said that they take an 'all or
nothing' approach to the BBC1 talent competition, and would only continue their roles if they all were in it together.

Music first: Jessie confirmed the news via Twitter on Friday morning

Do you think Jessie J made the right decision in quitting The Voice?

Jessie has failed to see either of 
her final contestants - Vince Kidd in series one and Matt Henry in 
series two - win the competition with Tom Jones and Danny O'Donoghue the
victorious mentors across the board so far.

But
the merits of winning the series have also been called into question as
the previous winner Leanne Mitchell, mentored by the Welsh warbler, 
sold fewer than 1,000 copies of her debut album.

Despite her 
departure, Jessie may have some involvement in the third series which 
the broadcaster announced would take place next year.

The 
short-haired singer had already had to postpone a major tour because of 
her commitments to The Voice a few months ago and her second album had 
to await completion until the show had ended.

The
BBC's entertainment team also confirmed the singer's departure via 
their own Twitter account, writing: 'Jessie J confirms she's leaving The
Voice to concentrate on promoting her album around the world.'

Mark Linsey, controller of entertainment commissioning,
said: 'We're so sorry to see Jessie go as she's been an exceptional coach
on - and advocate for - The Voice, but we totally support her decision to leave
due to touring commitments overseas.

'We very much hope that Jessie will remain part of the
show and come back and perform for us next series. In the meantime, we will now
start the search for a new coach.'

Paddy Power have suggested a number of potential replacements, giving Cheryl Cole the highest odds at 5/2 that she will be the newest member of the panel.

Will they stay? With Jessie's departure, the other judges may follow suit
