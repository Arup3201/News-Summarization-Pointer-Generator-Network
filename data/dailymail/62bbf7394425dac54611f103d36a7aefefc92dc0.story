A driver has died after being thrown from his vehicle when it hit a utility pole, careered off a Brooklyn bridge and landed more than 40 feet below.

The 27-year-old lost control of the Infiniti SUV he was driving east on the Belt Parkway, hitting a utility pole and rolling it over bridge railings before it became airborne and landed next to Mill Basin Creek below.

Pictures from the scene of the crash show rescue services cleaning up the site where a crane was required to lift the mangled vehicle from the water's edge.

Debris and other pieces of the vehicle remain scattered on the ground, while marks showing where it landed against the bridge support can also be seen.

The New York Post reported the driver, Michael Weber, hit the center median when travelling across the bridge about 2am Monday.

He was thrown from the car when he hit the guard rail, landing on the highway before the car itself plunged over the edge.

Weber was found unconscious with several broken bones and severe injuries to his head, and was pronounced dead at the scene.
