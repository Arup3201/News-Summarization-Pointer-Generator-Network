Dogs are known for being man's best friend, but after one dog stopped his owner from getting robbed at gunpoint he might soon be called man's best superhero instead. 

Thor, a Pit Bull-Boxer mix, didn't hesitate when a robber attacked his owner Justin Ireland, pouncing on the intruder and scaring him off in a matter of seconds.

Ireland was working the afternoon shift at a gas station in Saco, Maine when he said a man walked up to the door and asked to use the phone. 

This is the moment a hero dog named Thor pounced on an intruder who attempted to rob his owner, Justin Ireland, at gunpoint in a  Maine gas station

'I never let anyone in the building,' said Ireland. 'So I said no, I don't have a phone you can use.' 

The man then pulled out a gun and demanded money, before giving Ireland a hard shove. 

That was the moment, Ireland said, that Thor went on the attack, nipping at the robber's hand before biting him on both sides of the face, according to police. 

'As soon as the guy laid a hand on me and I started yelling, that's when he went right after him,' Ireland told WGME 13.  

Ireland was working the evening shift when a man came up to the door and asked if he could use a phone. Ireland, who said he never lets anyone in the building, told the man no

The man then forced his way in and pulled out a gun, which Thor immediately sprung for, and demanded money

Thor immediately went on the attack, nipping at the robber's hand before biting him on both sides of the face

The robber fled in a matter of seconds and still remains at large. Ireland has never trained Thor and said the dog acted on sheer instinct 

The intruder fled in a matter of seconds.  

Ireland, who has never trained Thor, said the three-year-old dog acted on sheer instinct. 

He said his boss has always liked having Thor around because 'he looks like good security'.  

Although Ireland ran after the robber, the man drove off and is still at large since the Tuesday attack. 

Police described the suspect as a 5'8 white male weighing 180 pounds who may have dog bites to his face. 

He was wearing a navy blue Gap hoodie during the attempted armed robbery and was carrying what Ireland said looked like a BB gun. 

The robber fled in a light blue Chevy Silverado truck.
