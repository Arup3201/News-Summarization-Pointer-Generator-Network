A young woman has told how a gang of men blackmailed her into having sex with them when she was 13 years old, by threatening to burn her younger brother alive.

The vulnerable schoolgirl was also sold to other men for sex from the age of 12 until she was15, under threat that the Oxford gang would hurt her family, a court heart today.

Nine men deny 51 counts, including rape, trafficking and organising prostitution involving six schoolgirls, some as young as 11.

On trial: The accused, seen in court today, allegedly sexually exploited Girl A and five other school girls and deny 51counts, including trafficking and rape

Now aged 21, she told a jury at the Old Bailey that she was pressured into having sex with three of the defendants, Kamar Jamil, Akhtar Dogar and Anjum Dogar.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she was repeatedly raped and sold for sex between 2004 and 2007 under threat of violence towards her family.

‘I was scared because they were grown men and I was a child.

‘They would say things like “we'll come and get you and burn your house down” to frighten me. They said they'd burn my brother alive.’

Noel Lucas QC, prosecuting, asked: ‘Did you believe them?’ ‘At the time, yes, I was very frightened,’ she answered.

Jamil,
 27, and the Dogar brothers, Akhtar, 32, and Anjum, 30, are accused of 
raping and organising the abuse of the woman known as Girl A.

A
 fourth defendant, Assad Hussain, 32, is alleged to have been one of the
 men who paid to have sex with her knowing she was under age.

'Girl
 A', who chose to give evidence in court in view of the accused rather 
than from behind a curtain, said she met three of them shortly after her
 thirteenth birthday in 2004.

Initially,
 she told the court, the men were nice to her and would buy her presents
 and offer her alcohol and cannabis. ‘Then they started asking for 
sexual favours,’ she said.

She
 told the court they wanted oral sex at first but soon demanded full sex
 before they began taking her to a number of locations, including hotel 
rooms, bedsits and parks, to have sex with strangers.

‘Because I liked them at the start I felt obliged. I felt like I owed it to them, like that was what I was supposed to do.

‘They
 made it sound like it was a party, like it was supposed to be fun, and 
in my childish naivety I believed these men were coming for a good time,
 a good time being a laugh. I didn't necessarily think that they would 
expect to have sex with me,’ she said.

Case: Girl A was the second alleged victim to give evidence at the Old Bailey, with four young girls remaining

As time went by the victim, now 21, 
said she began to resent herself but did as they said because their 
threats to hurt her family were 'always in the back of my mind.'

‘All the time they were treating me like a piece of meat that they could just tread all over.

‘But
 I got into the mindset that if a man wanted it, I was just supposed to 
give it. That probably sounds quite difficult to understand but that's 
how it was.

'I had no dignity left, no self-respect. I just gave them 
what they wanted,’ she added.

Jurors heard she suffered so much at the hands of the men she cannot even remember the first time she was abused by them.

‘Sometimes
 there would be one or two guys then more would turn up. They would take
 you to places and basically do what they wanted to you,’ she said.

Asked
 why she thought the men were interested in someone her age, she said: 
‘I didn't think of it like that at the time. I thought it was because 
they liked me.

‘Looking 
back I suppose I was seeking friendship in a way, I don't know. I felt 
empty a lot of the time. I was looking to fill a void. I was a child, a 
vulnerable child.’

Evidence: The now 21-year-old woman says the gang abused her from the age of 12, demanding sexual favours and eventually selling her on to other men around Oxford

The woman said she probably looked 15 when she met the defendants, as she was tall for her age, but added the men knew her real age.

She contacted police in September 2006 after claiming she was abused by one of the defendants - Akhtar Dogar - and another man when she was 15.

A video recording of her interview with police at the time of her report, was played to the jury.

During the interview, Girl A said: ‘I just hate myself. I just feel proper dirty and disgusted with myself.

‘I don't want them to have any hold over me. They can't control my life anymore.’

‘They're doing it to other girls. Little girls with their school uniforms on.’

Four more girls are still to evidence including one who was allegedly forced to have a back street abortion after one of the men got her pregnant.

Kamar Jamil, 27, Akhtar Dogar, 32, his brother Anjum Dogar, 30, Assad Hussain, 32, Mohammed Karrar, Bassam Karrar, Mohammed Hussain, 24, Zeeshan Ahmed, 27, and Bilal Ahmed, 26, deny all the charges against them.

The trial continues.
