Every woman’s dream is to look their best at her wedding and Gemma Durcan Smith dropped a whopping five stone to look like her idea of the perfect bride.

Gemma, 27, who used to gorge on fast food, vowed to take control of her weight and set herself a 12-month weight loss target to get slim for the big day. 

In January last year Gemma, from 
Saltney, Cheshire, tipped the scales at 14st 3lb but with the help of 
Weight Watchers dropped an amazing seven dress sizes.

Gemma lost an incredible 5st and seven dress sizes for her big day, dropping from 14st 3lb (left) to 9st 5lb (right)

Gemma's transformation meant she looked like a totally different women by the time she donned her wedding dress (right)

The thrilled teacher now weighs 9st 5lb and wears a size 8.

She said: 'When I got engaged I realised I just really didn’t want to be a fat bride.

'It’s probably the most photographed day of your life and I didn’t want to look back at the hundreds of pictures and be disappointed with the way I looked because of my weight.'

The religious studies teacher at Chester Catholic High School decided to embark on the Weight Watchers plan to rid herself of her unwanted pounds, which also gave structure to her hectic eating patterns. 

She said: 'I would never eat proper dinners, I would just grab whatever was fast and easy.

'Now I prepare my meals for the entire week and exercise every day, running four times a week and walking the 4 miles to and from work each day.

'I even went for a run every day on my honeymoon!'

Gemma used to overeat, often choosing junk food and eating at odd times (left) but now eats home-cooked food, planning her meals in advance and eating at regular times to maintain her 9st 5lbs weight (right)

Gemma's diet meant she was able to fit into a size 8 wedding dress - and she also discovered a love of exercise

The super slimmer followed the Weight Watchers plan, with her mother and her sister providing moral support. She opted for the Pro Points plan, which takes into account the amount of protein, carbohydrate, fat and fibre in a given portion.

And it wasn’t only Gemma who reaped the benefits of her new diet - her husband Alex dropped a stone by eating Gemma’s healthy meals.

Gemma said: 'I felt absolutely amazing on my wedding day and there isn’t a single picture I don’t like.

'I didn’t think I would feel so different after the weight loss but I feel so much better.

'I can even take my niece to the play centre now without the fear that I’ll get stuck and have to be cut out of it!'
