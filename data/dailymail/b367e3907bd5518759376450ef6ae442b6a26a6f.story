This is the dramatic moment a one-eyed mafia boss known as 'The Last King of Rome' was arrested at gunpoint as part of a massive swoop on the Italian capital's underworld.

Massimo Carminati, 56, who lost an eye when he was shot by police in 1981, was detained along with 27 others for setting up a vast criminal network that dominated Rome in the past ten years.

The home and office of Rome’s former mayor, Silvio Berlusconi ally Gianni Alemanno, were also searched as part of the operation, dubbed 'Terra di mezzo' or Middle Earth.

Carminati, a former member of neo fascist para-military organisation, has been accused of a number of high-profile murders.

His former gang La Banda della Magliana and terror group NAR have been linked to some of the most brutal killings in Italian history including the Bologna train massacre and killing of Prime Minister Aldo Moro.

His gang imposed their own mafia law on Rome in the 1970s and 1980s but he never served long in prison.

Since then Carminati has penetrated Rome's political and administrative domains and rekindled his criminal powers to become over the last decade the ‘Last King of Rome'.

He even inspired a character in the hit TV series Romanzo Criminale, which was broadcast on Sky in the UK in 2011.
