Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan knows the losing must stop for the Falcons, and it must stop this weekend at Wembley against Detroit.

The Falcons travelled to London for their International Series game against the Lions on the back of four straight defeats and carrying a 2-5 record.

Standing in their way of a first victory for over a month on Sunday afternoon at Wembley will be the Detroit Lions, who sit pretty atop the NFC North with a 5-2 record and boast the best defense in the league.

The Falcons are the 'home' team, but have won just once away from the Gerogia Dome in the past two seasons

‘Detroit is very good defensively and statistically near the top of the league in all categories,’ Ryan said at the team’s Grove Hotel base on Wednesday.

‘They have even had some injuries at the linebacker position but replaced some of their starters with good players. They have also got some of the premier defensive linemen in the league.

‘We are going to have to be solid up front and have good plans to account for where those guys are at and that's what we're working on. We are at a point on the season where we are going to have to win. I feel like we are going to have to start winning this week.’

Atlanta got down to business on Wednesday as they practiced for the first time this week at Arsenal’s Colney training headquarters ahead of their clash with the Lions.

Ryan is grateful for the opportunity to make use of a Premier League team’s facilities, and intends on watching a game in England at some point.

‘I have never been to a football game over here,’ the Atlanta quarterback said. ‘It's on the bucket list to do at some point. I first started watching football when I was in college because I started playing the game FIFA on Xbox and AC Milan was my team.

‘I'm a fan and like watching any sport when it is at the highest level. I watched Manchester United play the other night (against West Brom) and it was a really exciting game. Arsenal are very nice to let us go over there (to Colney) and make use of their space.’

The injury-hit Falcons made the 4,200-mile trip to London on Monday, leaving themselves six whole days to acclimate to the new surroundings, foreign country and time difference.

‘The most difficult part is probably the first two days and getting acclimated to the time difference,’ Ryan said. ‘We are now into our normal routine of what we do during the week. Guys have settled in and are really excited about the change of venue and to play in front of what we hear is a great crowd.’

Wide receiver Julio Jones, meanwhile, has taken a little longer than Ryan to settle into London life.

‘I haven't adjusted yet,’ Jones laughed. ‘I'm still hurting.

‘We went downtown the other day in a cab and walked around. It was expensive. It cost £70 or £80, but it helps when you're with a couple of guys who have money.’

Head coach Mike Smith says the Falcons are not out of contention in the NFC South

Head coach Mike Smith is happy with the way his team has adjusted to the foreign surroundings since touching down at Gatwick Airport at the beginning of the week.

‘The adjustment and the time change has been the biggest challenge,’ he said. ‘Once we arrived here our logistics people did a great job and we have been able to do everything like we would do it back home. It's been good so far.’

Despite Atlanta struggling at 2-5, they only trail NFC South leaders the Carolina Panthers by less than two wins.

Smith said: ‘We are right in the thick of the divisional race. It is going to be critical for us to get a win this week and stay in the race. It is very bunched and going to go down to the wire.

‘We have got to play better football than we have in the last four weeks. We have unfortunately had some injuries on our offensive line, but this is part of the NFL and you have to deal with it.’

And that offensive line will have to find a way of dealing with the Detroit’s dominant defense on Sunday.
