Prince and Princess Michael of Kent are to become grandparents for the first time, after it emerged that their son Lord Frederick Windsor and his actress wife are expecting a child.

Sophie Winkleman, who stars in hit US sitcom Two and a Half Men, is four months pregnant and is set to give birth in August – less than a year after claiming she and Lord Windsor had no plans to start a family.

The 31-year-old star and her husband, 33, who wed in a lavish ceremony at Hampton Court Palace in 2009, are now said to be ‘overjoyed’ at the prospect of starting a family.

The couple live in Los Angeles where Miss Winkleman is pursuing her acting career and Lord Windsor is working as a financial analyst.

A source said: ‘Sophie and Freddie are expecting their first child in August and both are overjoyed, as are the whole family.’

The half-sister of TV presenter Claudia Winkleman, Sophie has widely been given credit for taming Royal playboy Freddie, who has admitted to experimenting with cocaine in the past.

New arrival: The couple's first child is due in August

It was in an interview last year that 
Miss Winkleman explained she had no plans to start a family, saying: ‘I 
just feel that I have a lot of things that I want to do first. 
Fortunately, Freddie’s fine with that.’

Prince
 Michael, 70, is a cousin to both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. 
He married the then Baroness Marie-Christine von Reibnitz, in 1978.

She 
was a Catholic who refused to convert to Anglicanism and Prince Michael,
 eighth in line to the throne at the time of his birth, lost his place 
in the succession.

Lord Freddie, however, has retained his right of succession and is currently 40th in line to the throne.

The Cambridge-educated actress, who is the daughter of children’s book author Cindy Black and her husband Barry, a former managing director of publisher HarperCollins, made her name starring in Channel 4 comedy series, Peep Show.

She has gone on to appear in Julian Fellowes’ ITV drama, Titanic. She now plays the role of Ashton Kutcher’s girlfriend in the hit US comedy Two And A Half Men.

Prince and Princess Michael of Kent are to become grandparents for the first time

The couple became engaged on Valentine’s Day four years ago and went on to wed in September that year. Lord Windsor, spelled out his marriage proposal on a Scrabble board.

In Hollywood, she now regularly records radio plays, from Ayckbourn to Shakespeare.

Lord Windsor, an investment banker working with JP Morgan, got himself transferred to LA and the couple, nicknamed Windy and Winky, left England the day after their wedding at Hampton Court Palace so that Sophie could start work on the Monday. They didn’t even have a honeymoon.
