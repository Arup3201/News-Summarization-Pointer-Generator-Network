A groundbreaking new app for Google Glass allows users to take photos just by thinking about them.

MindRDR claims to be the world’s first telekinetic app for the hi-tech specs that lets a wearer use brainwaves to take photos of what they can see, simply by concentrating really hard on the image.

As well as thinking about taking the photo, wearers can then use the power of thought to share the pictures on Twitter and Facebook.

The current version of MindRDR uses commercially available brain monitor Neurosky MindWave Mobile to analyse brainwaves, expressed as meditation and attention levels.

These values are used to build up session information that charts concentration levels over time. Wearers of Glass and the sensor can take photos by concentrating and relaxing.

The app’s visual feedback is represented by a horizontal line that sits in the middle of the screen, which moves closer to the top of the screen the more users concentrate.

The more they relax, the further down the screen the line goes. Once the line reaches the top of the screen, Google Glass takes the photo.  

At the next screen, users either concentrate to move the line to the top of the screen and share it, or relax to move the line to the bottom to discard the image and take another photo.

The app also shows users ‘scores’ of how they are doing and signals success using emojis.

It means that users of Glass no longer 
have to touch the specs or use a voice command to take a picture, which 
will thrill some photographers but cause other people to worry that the 
innovation could be used to invade their privacy by wearers taking 
covert photos.

Built by London-based firm This Place, the free app, which launches today, uses Google Glass and the Neurosky EEG biosensor.

The app enables the sensor, which measures brainwaves to translate brain activity into action, to communicate with Google Glass, allowing users to control actions on the device by concentrating and relaxing.

MindRDR presents Google Glass wearers with visual feedback throughout the process to demonstrate how close they are to taking a picture and then lets them share it on social media channels.

‘Google Glass is one of the world’s most recognisable and popular pieces of wearable technology, but after getting our hands on it, the challenge of connecting it to brainwaves was one we could not resist,’ said Dusan Hamlin, founder and CEO of This Place.

Built by London-based firm This Place, the free app uses Google Glass and the Neurosky EEG biosensor (pictured) to measure a wearer's brainwaves and allow them to take photos simply by concentrating on what is in front of them

‘Currently, users either have to touch it or use voice commands, which are restrictive for some social situations and for users with disabilities.

‘All we could think was, how can we make the user’s experience even better? We wanted to realise the true potential of Glass by allowing users to control it with their minds.’

MindRDR’s visual feedback is represented by a horizontal line that sits in the middle of the screen, which moves closer to the top of the screen the more users concentrate.

The more they relax, the further down the screen the line goes. Once the line reaches the top of the screen, Google Glass takes a photo.  

At the next screen, users either concentrate to move the line to the top of the screen and share it, or relax to move the line to the bottom to discard the image and take another photo.

Chloe Kirton, creative director at This Place, says: ‘While MindRDR’s current capabilities are limited to taking and sharing an image, the possibilities of Google Glass telekinesis are vast.

‘In the future, MindRDR could give those with conditions like locked-in syndrome, severe multiple sclerosis or quadriplegia the opportunity to interact with the wider world through wearable technology like Google Glass.

‘This Place is already in conversation with Professor Stephen Hawking, amongst others, about the possibilities MindRDR could bring as the product evolves.’

Mr Hamlin said: ‘Imagine a world where you can interact with wearable devices just by thinking about the content you want. That’s the world we’re building, and we’re just getting started.’

In a bid to help the technology catch-on, the MindRDR software is open source and is available on GitHub from today.
