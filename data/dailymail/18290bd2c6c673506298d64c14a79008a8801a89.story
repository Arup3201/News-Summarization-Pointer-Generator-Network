Supermarket giant Asda have apologised to a pensioner after they charged her more than £50 - for a cabbage.

Jean Hudson, 61, thought nothing of the sky high food bill from her shop at the store in Tipton, West Midlands, and initially blamed the rising cost of food.

But it wasn't until she scrutinised the receipt that she realised that instead of paying just 30p for the item, she actually shelled out £53.55.

Rip-off: Jean Hudson, 61, from Sedgley, West Midlands, was charged over £53 for a cabbage at an Asda supermarket in nearby Tipton. It should have cost just 30p

Expensive: She took the cabbage back to the store where an employee crossed out the value

While husband Graham had grumbled over the sky-high fees Mrs Hudosn from Sedgley, West Midlands, thought nothing of it and carried out of the store and she didn't notice the mistake until she reached her car

Speaking yesterday the grandmother-of-four said: 'We were at the checkout and we went to pay and my husband said that the bill was a little steep, but I didn't think anything of it to be honest.

'It's not unusual for us to spend a little more if there is a deal on.

'We had bought extra items including biscuits and a few items for the Tipton Food bank and coffee for my son, so I thought nothing of it, but my husband kept grumbling about the amount all the way out of the shop and across the car park.

'I wasn't angry, more amused at first, it won't stop me from going back to the store.

'We went back to the customer services and showed the lady my receipt. She was more shocked than I was and seemed very concerned.

Shocked: Mrs Hudson's husband said the bill was a little steep, but she did not realise the error until she got into her car

'Although I found the whole thing rather humorous, some people may not have noticed and could have paid over the odds.'

The store gave Mrs Hudson a refund and a £2 voucher as a gesture of goodwill.

A spokesperson for Asda said: 'A system glitch meant that the cabbage was scanned at the wrong price. We're sorry for any inconvenience caused and we'll ensure this doesn't happen again.'

This is the second time the supermarket chain has been caught out by a pricing error in recent weeks.

Last month Warehouse worker John Brown, 37, revealed he had been charged over £400 for a loaf of bread - which should have cost under a fiver from a branch in nearby Wolverhampton.
