EastEnders' week-long 30th anniversary celebrations were thrown into jeopardy last night after a stray firework sparked a huge blaze on the Albert Square set.

The first of four special semi-live episodes kicked off on Tuesday, which will culminate in a fully live show revealing who killed Lucy Beale on Friday.

But off-screen, things were heating up on set after a  firework set fire to Dr Legg's old surgery- just hours after millions of viewers tuned in to watch the explosive storyline.

Firefighters rushed to the BBC's Elstree Studios after reports one of the buildings in the Albert Square set was on fire and found the first floor and roof space were filled with flames

Firefighters rushed to the BBC's Elstree Studios after reports one of the buildings in the Albert Square set was on fire and found the first floor and roof space were filled with flames. 

A spokesman for Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said two crews from nearby Potters Bar and Borehamwood were scrambled to tackle the blaze late last night.

'Crews from Borehamwood and Potters Bar were called to the BBC Elstree Studios shortly after 11pm to tackle a fire that had taken hold in the first floor and roof space of a building on Albert Square,' he added.

It is believed that the fire was started accidentally by a firework.

A spokeswoman for the soap said: 'There was a very small fire on set on Tuesday night after rehearsals had finished.

The blaze began at the old surgery of Dr Harold Legg, played by Leonard Fenton, who was Walford's original GP and featured on the show between 1985 and 1989

'It has not affected any Live week plans and nobody was harmed.'

The blaze began at the old surgery of Dr Harold Legg, played by Leonard Fenton, who was Walford's original GP and featured on the show between 1985 and 1989. 

The roof and interior of the surgery were badly damaged but area commander Ian Parkhouse insisted that the quick response of firefighters meant that no serious damage was caused to the set and the live shows would not be affected.

'Thanks to the hard work of our firefighters, the fire was contained and extinguished before it could cause any serious damage to the set,' he said.

'We're pleased that we were able to deal with this incident quickly, so it shouldn't affect the 30 year celebrations taking place this week.'

The week-long celebration of the long-running soap kicked off with a special edition of The Graham Norton Show on Tuesday before the four live shows began on the same evening, building up to a fully-live show finale on Friday.

The episodes will reveal who killed Lucy Beale, with the killer being unmasked in an hour long special on Thursday before a fully live 30 minute finale on Friday night. 

The character of Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) was found dead in the soap last Easter

Fans have been desperate to find out who was behind the murder of Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) who was discovered dead on Walford Common from a deliberately inflicted head injury on 18 April 2014. 

At the end of the first live episode, Max Branning (Jake Wood) confronted his daughter Abi (Lorna Fitzgerald) and accused her of being the killer.

Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) struggled to cope after discovering the murder's true identity after piecing together the clues in detective Emma Summerhayes' case file.

Long-term fans of the show have been suspicious of Max and Abi for some time, as they have been covering up what they were really doing when Lucy was murdered on Good Friday. 

Despite the Abi bombshell, it was heavily hinted the blame could lie with a member of the Beale family.

Lauren wrote an anonymous message to Jane in her wedding card, which read: 'I know what happened to Lucy. 'She was killed at home.' She also refused to reconcile with boyfriend Peter Beale- Lucy's twin.

Ian Beale also raised suspicions after expressing how guilty he feels. 'I don’t deserve to be happy', he lamented. 

Lucy's killer will finally be revealed during Friday's live episode.
