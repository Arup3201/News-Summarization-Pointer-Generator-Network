Steve McClaren leans back, puffs out his cheeks and says with a smile: ‘You’re really depressing me! I think we’ve spoken enough about that.’

The topic is England 2 Croatia 3, November 21, 2007 — the night his ambitions as national manager turned to dust. A reluctance to continue the conversation beyond a 10th question is quite understandable, but so too is the link drawn from that match to now, the day McClaren returns to the Wembley dug-out.

He does so, by his own admission, a better manager leading a vibrant Derby County side into a game worth more than £130million to the victor.

On the brink: Derby boss Steve McClaren has put his side just one win away from promotion to the Premier League

The fact that he owes this moment to the man who is his opponent on Saturday makes the match even more fascinating.

Harry Redknapp gave McClaren a coaching job at Queens Park Rangers at the start of this season that the former England manager calls ‘fantastic for me’.

It saved him from trips to Tesco and afternoons gardening. It also gave him an insight into ‘the worst’ dressing room he has witnessed, with players who ‘didn’t want to be on the training field, didn’t want to play for QPR. Only Harry Redknapp could have sorted that out’.

Three months later and after positive reviews from inside Loftus Road, Derby chief executive Sam Rush came calling, having dismissed Nigel Clough. The stint in west London was not pivotal to McClaren’s appointment but it helped soothe supporters initially angry at the removal of a legendary name.

The 53-year-old unlocked the team’s potential to such an extent that Derby head into this  Championship play-off final as favourites despite bringing less experience and a significantly smaller annual wage bill (£12m v £78m).

‘It’s a fairy-tale ending to the season,’ says McClaren. ‘It will be great to see Harry, the staff and players again. I had three great months but I always had one eye on getting back into management and once this opportunity came I’d have walked here.

‘Harry and I will have a cup of tea together before the game and a big hug at the end no matter what happens.’

McClaren has been back to the scene of his darkest hour plenty of times in the past seven years, most recently for last weekend’s FA Cup final, but never to marshal a team, never with the cameras directed his way.

Staying dry: McClaren uses an umbrella during an England match in 2008

He was derided as the ‘Wally with the Brolly’ the last time as the rain fell and he stood sheltered under an umbrella watching England fail to qualify for Euro 2008.

On this occasion he has been good-humoured enough to joke that he ‘won’t be taking a bloody brolly’. But he also addressed those memories with seriousness.

‘The biggest thing that hurt me that night and ever since, was the failure to qualify,’ he says. ‘It felt like I’d let the nation down. That’s what I’ve had to live with. That’s the hardest thing, nothing else peripheral, like the “Wally with the Brolly”.

‘That disappointment will not go away and still hurts, but you have to get on with life and football. To be fair I wanted to work the next day. I wanted to get back on the bike as quickly as possible. I had support from a lot of good people and I think that is what you need. All managers go through it.’

On reflection, he thinks the England job came too soon but he felt compelled to take the opportunity, having guided Middlesbrough to one League Cup and the UEFA Cup final.

‘I thought I was ready and the job finds out that you are not,’ he says. ‘I didn’t have the experience. ‘But because I was England  manager it has given me some great opportunities. I don’t think I would have gone abroad unless I had actually done that job. So it had its bad and good points.’

A title with FC Twente in Holland and a spell at Wolfsburg in Germany followed, but last summer he  was without a club, until a chat about coaching at QPR with Sportmail’s Jamie Redknapp at a dinner.

Saturday is the first time that goal-line technology will be used in a Football League match. The Hawk-Eye system will be used for all three play-off finals.

‘He mooted the idea and said he would mention it to his dad,’ says McClaren.

‘What was the choice? Doing the gardening and Tesco’s or working.’

The atmosphere he walked into, however, was toxic. ‘After a week I remember saying to Harry,

“You’ve got a hell of a job on to turn it round”. There were many players who didn’t want to be there. I think only Harry Redknapp could have done that job, I really do. Anybody with less experience or a foreign manager would not.

‘He had zero tolerance and the club were very supportive. Many players left. After two months of hard work you could see they had a squad who’d got spirit. There’s a lot of pressure on QPR to go up, they are talking about a lot of money. Harry’s done a fantastic job.’

Most would say the job performed by McClaren in lifting a team who were 14th when he took over to third with a club-record points haul and as the division’s top scorers is rather brilliant too.

Training is detailed and enjoyable, loan signings have been smart, and substitutions more often than not paid off. The football is attractive, and the side are youthful — Derby’s likely starting XI has an average age of 24.9. Crowds have risen from an average of 23,228 last season to 24,933 this.

The buzz reminds McClaren of his time as assistant to Jim Smith in the 1990s when the pair guided Derby to promotion and then consolidated in the Premier League.

‘They were great days with Jim, I knew then what Derby County was all about,’ says McClaren. ‘Coming back we just want to create those times again.’

A cathartic win at Wembley would begin to realise those hopes.

‘I was having afternoons off school to play matches – I probably wasn’t cut out to teach really! It does seem a bit ridiculous to spend four years qualifying and then to spend not so long actually doing it.’

Friendly showdown: Redknapp and McClaren face each other for a place in the Premier League next season

But all of that has gone into the making of a manager who is already attracting interest from Premier League clubs.

He is certainly more akin to a PE teacher in the technical area, preferring his tracksuit and jumper to any suave or sophisticated suits.

Will he make a change for Wembley? ‘Not on the touchline,’ he insists.

‘I will lead my team out in a suit, but I’ll be putting my tracksuit on for the game. I have to get my battle gear on, don’t I?’

It seems hard to imagine this gentle giant as a general leading his troops to war, but come 3pm on Saturday, battle will commence.

DERBY

1 GEORGE THORNE, 21

The 6ft 2in January loan signing from West Bromwich Albion has taken to the Derby midfield like it’s been his home for years. Thorne will sit as the fulcrum, break up attacks, and start moves.

2 JAKE BUXTON, 29

From Conference football with Burton Albion in 2009 to the Premier League in 2014 would be a remarkable journey but the central defender (right) commands respect with his solid displays.

3 CHRIS MARTIN, 25

Became the first Derby player since Dean Sturridge in 1996 to reach the 20-goal mark and now has 25 for the season. Good interplay and finishing. Not bad for a free summer transfer from Norwich. 

QPR

1 JOEY BARTON, 31

Needs no introduction. Marginalised by the club last season when he went to Marseille on loan but pulling the strings in midfield now. Can Barton be a hero?

2 NIKO KRANJCAR, 29

Been a Wembley winner before with Portsmouth. Hopefully Kranjcar has fully recovered from a hamstring injury he suffered in the play-off second-leg win over Wigan. The Croatian midfielder’s experience will be a key factor.

3 CHARLIE AUSTIN, 24

QPR’s goal machine. Despite being out for more than two months with a shoulder injury he’s hit top form at the right time and his 20th goal of the season sent his side to Wembley. If he fires Rangers have a terrific chance of promotion.
