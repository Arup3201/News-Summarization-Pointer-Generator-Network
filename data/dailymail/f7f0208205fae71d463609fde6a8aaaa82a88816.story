China may ban Facebook, but not its co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who stunned an audience of students in Beijing by speaking in fluent Mandarin.

He did not explicitly discuss the social media site ban during his Q&A at prestigious Tsinghua University, but an indirect reference drew laughter from the audience.

Zuckerberg, whose company has long sought to enter the Chinese market, highlighted that Facebook already helps some Chinese companies in foreign markets.

Fluent: Mark Zuckerberg speaks Mandarin during a dialogue with students as a newly-appointed member to the advisory board for Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management in Beijing, China

Zuckerberg married Priscilla Chan in 2012, and set himself the goal of learning Mandarin in 2010

'Speaking of China, I have a more difficult question for Mark, which I hope will not get me fired. What are Facebook's plans in China?' asked the forum facilitator and Facebook employee Wei Xiaoliang.

'We are already in China,' Zuckerberg said in Chinese, to more laughter. 'We help Chinese companies gain customers abroad.'

'We want to help the rest of the world connect to China.'

Zuckerberg married Chinese-American Priscilla Chan in 2012, and set himself the goal of learning Mandarin in 2010.

He said  that he wanted to learn the language partly because his wife's grandmother only speaks Chinese.

'Priscilla and I decided to get married, so I told her grandmother in Chinese, and she was very surprised,' Zuckerberg said.

He said China is a great country and hopes that learning the language will help him learn its culture. 'The Chinese language is difficult, and I speak English, but I like challenges,' Zuckerberg said.

Beijing promotes Internet use for business and education but bans material deemed subversive or obscene and blocks access to foreign websites run by human rights and Tibet activists and some overseas news and social media sites.

On China's social media, many microbloggers noted the irony that Zuckerberg's famous creation is blocked in China.

Designer David Wang, in an interview in downtown Beijing, said he would be happy if Facebook was allowed across the so-called Great Firewall of China.

'Because now we have to use software to jump the Wall if we want to access Facebook,' he said.

Zuckerberg visited Beijing this week as a newly-appointed member to the advisory board for Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management. 

Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company is planning to open 25 retail stores in China within the next two years, according to Sina.com.

The technology giant currently has 15 outlets in the country and earns around 15 per cent of its revenue in Greater China, Cook said. 

He said: 'We're investing like crazy in the market," Cook said on the call. "When I look at China, I see an enormous market where there are more people graduating into the middle class than any nation on Earth in history.'

He met Tuesday with Tsinghua President Chen Jining to discuss cooperation in education, according to a statement by Tsinghua.

Zuckerberg's Chinese pronunciation was far from fluent and some native speakers said it was a 'challenge' to understand him. 

But he was able to maintain intelligible conversation for a half-hour and the students responded with warm cheers for his effort and laughter at his humor. 

Li Qin, a computer programmer from the eastern city of Hangzhou, said in an online chat that she could barely understand Zuckerberg's Chinese.

'It was a challenge for Chinese listening comprehension. But even though Facebook cannot enter the Chinese market, Mark is still making a fighting effort to learn,' she said. 'It was quite a funny scenario.'
