This BMX biker has made the most of his Citi Bike rental - using the clunky cycle to do wheelies, tricks and grinds.

In this amazing footage, professional rider and bike shop owner Tyrone Williams does several impressive tricks around the streets of New York City.

After picking up his bicycle on South 3rd Street and Bedford Avenue, the biker does an almost impossibly long wheelie down a deserted street.

Let's go! Tyrone picks up his bike on South 3rd Street and Bedford Avenue

Hot wheels: The BMX biker then does a wheelie on the heavy bike

Hop: Tyrone scales a ramp, then jumps down a series of steps

Messing around: The biker puts both feet on one pedal and rides along

Trick: The pro does a bunny hop down a street

Tyrone then drives the heavy blue bike up a ramp before jumping down a series of steps.

Afterwards, he rides off along a road before doing a bunny hop.

Later, the talented rider takes his feet off the pedals and places them on the handle bars, before reclining back with his arms outstretched.

Tyrone can then be seen in a skate park doing jumps, spins and grinds.

Impressive: In one particularly amazing clip, the pro jumps over a bench

Towards the end of the video, he is joined by fellow bikers on BMXs.

But Tyrone doesn't let his clunky bike hinder him - speeding round steep corners and over bumps.

Finally, he finishes by parking the bike back in the docking station where he started.

In a comic twist, he then presses the 'service' button to make sure the bike is looked over after his ride.

The footage has now been uploaded on several websites and has been shared several hundred times.

Daredevil Tyrone was asked to test the bike out in the unusual way by online magazine, Animal New York.

Fans of the video today reacted to the footage on Twitter, saying it was the 'coolest thing ever'.

Another, Russ Bengtson, said: 'Tyrone Williams is the best'

As well as being a professional rider, Tyrone owns Manhattan bike shop Dah Shop - the first BMX specific shop in the city with friend, Qian.

Back to the start: The rider docks the bike before pressing the 'service' button

He also innovated a unique street style of riding called 'Rone', several videos of which are on YouTube.

The Citi Bikes were launched in New York in May.

They are usually used by tourists and locals to get them from A to B and can be hired for a day, week or a year from stations around the city.

But, much like the so-called 'Boris Bikes' in London, they are heavy, clunky and slow - especially in comparison to the high-end BMXs Tyrone would usually perform tricks on.
