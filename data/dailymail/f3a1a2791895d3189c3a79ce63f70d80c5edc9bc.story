The Hotel Carter famously won TripAdvisor's 'dirtiest hotel in America' award three times in a year, but now there are buyers bidding to snap up the New York accommodation with the price expected to reach $180million (£107million).

The 600-room hotel, just off Times Square on West 43rd Street, has had bug infestations, was the site of a murder in 2007 and has violated 15 building codes from uncharged fire extinguishers and exit signs that don't light up to lifts that were overdue for inspection.

Lawrence Wolfe, who has been handling the sale, told NBC News: 'It's the dirtiest, and best located hotel in New York City. It was under-managed and neglected.'

Key location: The Hotel Carter is expected to sell for £107million, despite its questionable reputation for cleanliness

In need of an upgrade: The bathrooms were pictured with stains and mould when the Hotel Carter won the 'Dirtiest hotel in America' title for the third time in 2009

First opened in the 1930s as the Hotel Dixie, it was famed as an affordable New York location, but in recent years the two-star accommodation had insect infestations, bed bugs and even used discarded hospital linens for its bedding.

In 2007, a woman in her 20s was found dead in room 608, with her head and legs wrapped in plastic bags. She had been strangled.

Tran Dinh Truong owned the hotel from 1977 but died in 2012, which prompted a temporary administrator to step in while it was decided what to do with the property.

John J. Cruz, from GF Management, took over with 15 building code violations in various stages of being addressed, rooms cost $99 (£59) a night with the bizarre tag-line 'You Wanted in Time Square & Less'

Room for the night: The Hotel Carter has more than 600 rooms of varying quality

Prime position: The hotel will sell for £107million for its location in New York, but will need a £75million upgrade

A total of 25 bidders were interested in the hotel, but it has now been narrowed to a final few and the property is expected to sell for around $180million (£107million), with the buyer committing to a full renovation at a cost of $100-125million (£60-75million).

Mr Wolfe has confirmed the hotel will remain independent.

The hotel last scooped the 'dirtiest' award from TripAdvisor in 2009, but the awards were scrapped altogether in 2012.

However, customers have left mixed comments on the review website, with more than one thousands rating it as 'terrible'.

Ahmed M left the comment: 'The hotel is less than 5 minutes away from Times Square. So I don't think anyone could complain about its location. The rooms however were somewhat filthy. I've stayed in a lot of motels throughout the US, with much higher hygiene levels. The floors were dirty and the bathtub stained.'

Connoramy described the hotel as: 'Absolutely vile! Unsafe, nasty and falling down!'

However, over the past year the reviews have been improving, with many stating that although the hotel was out of date, for the location and price they couldn't complain.
