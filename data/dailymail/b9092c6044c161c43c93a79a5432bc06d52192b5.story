Rupert Murdoch today laid bare the scale of the U.S. investigation into his media empire as he revealed his embattled newspaper group is handing over tens of thousands of emails to phone-hacking investigators at the Department Of Justice.

During a dramatic appearance before the inquiry into press ethics in London today, the tycoon said approximately 60,000 internal emails  sent by and to employees at his now-defunct News Of The World and The Sun newspapers had been passed to investigators in the U.S.

He made his shock admission as two major shareholder 
groups today called on Mr Murdoch to step down as chairman of New York-based News 
Corporation due to the 'lax ethical culture' exposed by the media 
empire's 'still emerging scandals'.

Under pressure: Rupert Murdoch must step down as chairman of News Corporation due to the 'lax ethical culture' exposed by the media empire's 'still emerging scandals', two major shareholder groups said today

The U.S. investor, the Christian Brothers Investment Services has said: 'It’s time for News Corp to be run for the benefit of all shareholders, not just the Murdoch family.'

In a statement published by the Leveson 
Inquiry today, Mr Murdoch, 81, revealed that a standards committee at his News International group is passing the internal emails to investigators at the Department Of Justice, as well as police officers at Scotland Yard in London.

It said: 'Since July 2011, [the team] has actively cooperated with the Metropolitan Police 
as well as with the United States Department of Justice, turning over 
evidence of alleged or suspected illegality, and responding to all 
requests for information.

'This has led to the arrests of a number of News International employees.' 

The revelation that Mr Murdoch's British 
business arm is cooperating with U.S. officials exposes the serious threat the hacking scandal is now posing 
to News Corporation.

It will be seized upon by opponents of 
Murdoch - both inside and outside the U.S. arm of his empire - who are 
eager to remove him from his position of power.

The phone-hacking scandal which has engulfed Murdoch's British newspaper empire first extended to the U.S. last month after it was claimed that 9/11 families may be among hacking victims along with a number of celebrities whose phones were allegedly hacked while on U.S. soil.

The phone hacking scandal which has rocked Murdoch's newspaper empire in the UK looks set to taint his U.S. media operations. 

Lawyer Mark Lewis has previously won damages for celebrities against the News of the World in London and the family of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.

He is now planning to take on News Corp in the U.S.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder launched an investigation last year after reports that News of the World journalists asked a New York private detective to hack into the phones of 9/11 victims -  which he declined to do.

Mr Lewis will team up with Norman Siegel, a New York-based lawyer to represent 20 families of September 11 victims.

Princess Diana’s former butler Paul Burrell is expected to launch a lawsuit claiming his phone was hacked while in the States. 

A second suit is linked to the England football team - believed to be David Beckham who now lives with his family in Los Angeles. 

The third is described as a ‘Hollywood case’ as the person was in touch with a well-known celebrity which made him a target.

The FBI was believed to have questioned actor Jude Law last year about allegations his phone was hacked while he was in the U.S.

Princess Diana’s former butler Paul Burrell is expected to be one of the trio of individuals due to launch lawsuits claiming that their phones were hacked while they were in America.

Last week a lawyer for phone-hacking victims in the UK flew to New York to meet the American attorney representing 9/11 families.

Mark Lewis, the solicitor representing many celebrities who have won damages against the News of the World in London, said he is planning to launch three civil lawsuits over alleged phone-hacking against News Corp.

Last Friday it was also revealed that James Murdoch could be hauled before a judge in the U.S. to answer questions about phone hacking.

Rupert's son, the deputy chief 
operating officer of News Corp, would be quizzed over whether payments 
to hacking victims were part of a cover-up, said lawyer Mr Lewis.

Mr
Murdoch quit as chairman of BSkyB in March and moved from London to New
York after becoming a ‘lightning rod’ for criticism over the scandal.

Mr Lewis then last week revealed that
he has been contacted by people who accuse Fox News and The New York 
Post, which are both owned by News Corp, of engaging in criminal 
behaviour.

The Murdochs' U.S. legal problems come as two major shareholder 
groups today called on Mr Murdoch to step down as chairman of News 
Corporation due to the 'lax ethical culture' exposed by the media 
empire's 'still emerging scandals'.

The Local Authority Pensions Fund 
Forum (LAPFF), a British organisation whose members control £100billion 
of investments, and U.S. group Christian Brothers Investment Services 
(CBIS) have announced that they will file a joint motion seeking an 
independent chairman to replace Murdoch.

The
move is not the first time that LAPFF and CBIS have called on Murdoch, 
81, to quit, but the latest bid will be much more serious for the media 
mogul.

CBIS proposed he step down ahead of the most recent News Corp annual meeting last October.

But the group was unable to rally 
much support because it could only file a 'floor' resolution after 
missing the spring deadline due to the phone hacking scandal, reports 
the Daily Telegraph. This meant that only those in attendance at the 
annual meeting could vote.

By
announcing their intention now, the joint motion will be open for all 
shareholders to vote on ahead of this October's annual meeting, instead 
of just those at the Los Angeles event.

Not over yet: Rupert Murdoch leaves the Leveson Inquiry in London today as phone hacking lawsuits were being prepared against his U.S. media empire

The development comes a day after News Corp suffered another tumultuous day at the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics in London.

With
James Murdoch in the witness seat, the media empire disclosed emails 
showing how Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt 'shared their objectives' to 
take full control of broadcaster BSkyB.

The damning dossier, which has led to
calls for Mr Hunt's resignation, showed the top Tory's aides engaged in
an extraordinary pact with News Corp to push the deal through despite 
grave concerns from media watchdogs.

The sensational cache, which reveals 
'absolutely illegal' information was being freely exchanged between 
government and big business, was published by the Leveson Inquiry on the
eve of Rupert Murdoch's testimony to the hearings today.

James Murdoch yesterday told the Leveson Inquiry that a typed 'emoticon' after this email meant the 'illegal' reference was a joke.
