Paul Ward, 19, was sentenced to 14 years for the abuse of a 10-month-old baby with cutlery

A teenage paedophile almost killed a 10-month-old baby boy by abusing him with cutlery.

The infant had to undergo emergency surgery and was close to death after the abuse by Paul Ward.

The 19-year-old, from Leeds, was jailed for 14 years after being convicted of three counts of assault by penetration of a child under 13 and one charge of wounding with intent at Leeds Crown Court.

Judge Neil Clarke told Ward it was 'perhaps the most unpleasant' case of abuse he had come across.

The court was told that the child suffered a ruptured bowel in the incident on January 26.

He was left bleeding heavily and fitting.

The baby had to be revived twice in hospital and now has a colostomy bag.

Judge Clarke told Ward: 'On two occasions [the baby] nearly passed away.

'Doctors said the injuries to his bowel were acutely painful.

'It would have been obvious to you that he would have been in distress and severe pain and yet you continued to do it.

'You did that not just intending serious harm, but with a sexual motive. This is perhaps the most unpleasant abuse of a baby that I have ever come across.'

Ward denied three charges of assault but was convicted by a jury.

He was sentenced to 14 years on September 19 and will initially be sent to a young offenders' institution. The judge also ordered an eight year extension to his licence on release.

Detective Inspector Lawrence Bone, of Leeds District Safeguarding Unit, said: 'Ward was found guilty of appalling sexual abuse against a baby that he had been entrusted to care for.

Judge told Ward at Leeds Crown Court it was the 'most unpleasant' case of abuse he had come across

'He is clearly a callous and dangerous individual who has scant regard for the pain and suffering the child has endured. The victim had to undergo emergency surgery and the prognosis remains uncertain.

'This has been a particularly harrowing case for everyone involved to deal and one which required very sensitive and professional handling.

'We hope Ward's imprisonment will help to provide some degree of comfort to the child's family.

Wardâ€™s name will be on the sex offender register for life.
