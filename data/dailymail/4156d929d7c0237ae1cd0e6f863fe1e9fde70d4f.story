It was a diet forced upon families during the Second World War.

But one Forties fanatic is planning on living off food rationing for a month to mark the 75th anniversary of its introduction in the UK.

Louise Rhucroft, from Acklam, Middlesbrough, will be living off forgotten dishes such as Woolton pie, mince slices and corn beef pie to raise money for the Royal British Legion.

Louise Rhucroft is following a strict rationed diet for four weeks to mark 75 years since the introduction of rationing on January 8. She is hoping to raise money for The Royal British Legion

The 34-year-old is only buying food that was allowed in a 1940s ration book

A typical day's food intake during this month would be oatmeal and water with a touch of sugar for breakfast; soup, stew or left overs from the night before for lunch and something substantial such as pie for dinner. 

100g of bacon and ham

450g of meat

50g of butter

50g of cheese

100g of margarine

100g of cooking fat

Three pints of milk

112g of preserves (450 to last whole month)

1 shell egg (to last whole month)

225g sugar

50g of tea

87g of sweets (350g to last whole month) 

The 34-year-old, who started the project on January 8, starts her day with oatmeal with water, followed by leftovers for lunch and a hefty pie for tea.

And one of the unexpected benefits of sticking to a rations' diet has been the cost of Louise's shopping - which has dropped to just £10 a week. 

She said: 'I have always wanted to do it. 

'I am obsessed with the 1940s and 1950s.  I decided to do it after seeing how much food everyone buys at Christmas. 

Louise admits she used to 'buy everything going' but realised the huge difference in lifestyles when she watched a wartime programme on TV.

'I watched the BBC Wartime Farm Christmas special and saw how they came together as a community. It is so different how we used to do Christmas,' she said. 

'It has made me realise how much money I waste on food. I have hardly spent anything.

'I am so used to convenience and just grabbing something out of the freezer or ringing for a takeaway. 

'I feel 10 times better for it. I don't think I want to go back to eating as much as I used to, but I am looking forward to having something stodgy and a glass of wine. 

Forgotten dishes such as Woolton pie, mince slices and corn beef pie, feature heavily in her meals

Louise got 2015 off to a good start by using her 16-point monthly allowance to buy a tin of corned beef and ditching the alcohol - which was hard to come by in those days.

The challenge has meant that she must concentrate her allowances - a tin of Spam would cost eight points - although that hasn't seen her lacking for food.  

Rations for the month have included meat, butter, cheese, margarine, cooking fat, milk, sugar, preserves, tea, eggs and sweets. 

And while at first glance the list might not look that bad, Ms Rhucroft's 50 grams of cheese and three pints of milk have to last her a week.   

Ms Rhucroft says she 'decided to do it after seeing how much food everyone buys at Christmas' 

Ms Rhucroft said: 'I have had the good, old corned beef, but I have avoided the Spam so far. 'I have also eaten a lot of vegetables and a lot of soup.'

So far, her favourite meal has been fish cakes in which she uses  cod, mashed potato a carrot and half a rasher of bacon to make. 

The bean medley - made up mainly of 84 grams haricot beans, a teaspoon of treacle, 141 grams of mixed vegetables and 14 grams of chopped bacon - is her worst meal. 

 'I hate baked beans, so I don't know why I thought I would give it a try,' she said. 

'But in those days you would not have been able to waste it, so I have fought my way through, even if I hated eating it.'

Louise will be continuing with her challenge until 29 January.To donate, visit www.justgiving.com/Louise-Rhucroft1.
