Manchester United winger Nani has revealed his loan spell at Sporting Lisbon has rekindled his love for the game.

After finding first-team action hard to come by over the last few seasons, the 28-year-old returned to his home country in August to get some game-time under his belt - and it seems to have done the trick.

Nani has made 13 appearances for Sporting Lisbon this season; the exact same amount he made for Manchester United in the entirety of 2013/14.

'I saw the opportunities at United were going to be less for me so I had to make a choice. I had been at Old Trafford for a long time, for seven years, and I think I needed a little time away to understand and find my confidence again,' Nani told the Manchester Evening News. 

'That is what is happening. It is going well. It has turned out very good for me. It has made me very confident again for the future. Yes, I had to get away from United to achieve this.

'I am enjoying my game again. Football is the best thing in my life. Football has given me everything and I when I play I really enjoy myself so I want to play all the time. That wasn't happening when I was at United. When I don't play I am very disappointed.'
