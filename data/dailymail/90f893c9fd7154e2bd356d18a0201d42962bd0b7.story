For centuries, ships navigated the globe propelled by large sails - and one firm is hoping to return to this way of life, albeit it with a hi-tech twist.

A Norwegian engineer has designed a radical new cargo ship with a hull so large it acts as the sails of old. 

Called Vindskip, the hull on the concept would act as a so-called giant airfoil to harness power from the wind and lift and propel the ship forward, while onboard software would constantly monitor weather forecasts to choose the best course possible.

The Vindskip (pictured), designed by Lade AS, uses a hull designed to act as a so-called airfoil, or giant sail. The makers of the wind-powered hybrid merchant ship said that while engines are still needed, their design could achieve fuel savings of 60% while reducing emissions by 80%

The makers of the wind-powered hybrid merchant ship said that while engines are still needed, their design could achieve fuel savings of 60 per cent, and reduce emissions by 80 per cent.

The software is being developed by Germany's Fraunhofer Center for Maritime Logistics and Services, and the concept ship was designed by Terje Lade, from Lade AS. 

Fraunhofer's software will monitor the wind conditions and calculate the best route for the ship, by comparing real-time meteorological information to calculate wind energy.

'With this software, you input when you want to leave and when you want to arrive, the weather forecast is loaded into the program and then it calculates the best route,' Lade told CNN.

The relative wind is given by the ship's course and speed, and the direction and strength of the True Wind.

True wind is the wind measured on board a stationary ship. When the ship starts moving, the apparente wind is  generated.

The Wind Power System of Vindskip uses this apparent wind to generate a 'positive force in the longitudinal direction of the ship', described as 'the angle of attack'. 

The ship can then be repositioned to take advantage of this wind propulsion. 

Special software will monitor the wind conditions and calculate the best route for the ship, by comparing real-time meteorological information to calculate wind energy. 

This data will be constantly tracked and updated to make sure the ship stays on course to arrive on time.  

'This would be dynamically updated every day. 

'At each waypoint it would check with the time arrival and tell the crew whether to speed up using the engines or slow down; it makes it very easy for the crew.' 

The relative, or apparent, wind is given by the ship's course and speed, and the direction and strength of the true wind.

True wind is the wind measured on board a stationary ship. When the ship starts moving, the apparent wind is  generated.

The Wind Power System of Vindskip uses this apparent wind to generate a 'positive force in the longitudinal direction of the ship', described as 'the angle of attack'.

This generates a lift, which creates propulsion, and the ship can be repositioned to take advantage of this wind propulsion.

The ship would also use a liquefied natural gas-powered (LNG) electrical generator for the remainder of its energy, and to get it going from a standstill. 

'Over time, the contribution of the ship's Wind Power System to the actual propulsion of the ship will vary' continued the firm. 

'However, a Cruise Control will balance the LNG-electric propulsion system so it works  with the Wind Power System - keeping a constant speed of the ship.'

This control will adjust the pitch on the propeller, as well the rotations per minute, making it possible to use fuel more efficiently. 

The design of the Vindskip has a large opening for cargo, and lifeboats that drop from a 'lip' around the top of the boat if needed.

The firm also said the design, which draws inspiration from the aerospace industry to create the 'symmetrical airfoil' hull, could eventually be used for giant cruise ships.

'The relative wind is a crucial factor in designing aircrafts, trains, propellers and sailing boats. But for the design of commercial vessels, this is a revolutionary brand new way of thinking,' explained Lade AS. 

'Inspired by the aerospace industry and the sailboat environment, the Vindskip is designed to utilise wind for propulsion. The unique element is the shape of the hull, both above and below the water line.' 

The firm has begun offering the design and technology to consultancies, ship owners and ship yards for licensing, but it is not known when a fully-functioning Vindskip will be made.

During a journey, the route would be updated daily, and at each waypoint, the software would check arrival time. It would then tell the crew to speed up using the engines, or slow down. This GIF shows how the direction could change day-by-day, and how this would theoretically affect fuel consumption

In August 2013, the world's largest solar boat - the MS Tûranor PlanetSolar - docked in London as part of its epic scientific discovery along the Gulf stream.

The eco-friendly boat's crew of nine was collecting data on the sea and atmosphere between the United States and Norway as part of an investigation into climate change.

The impressive vessel crossed the Atlantic in a record breaking 22 days in 2013. when it travelled from Las Palmas, Canary Islands to Saint Martin in the Caribbean. 

The catamaran, which is a scientific research platform for the University of Geneva (UNIGE), has a top speed of 14 knots and has 809 solar panels that can generate up to 480 kWh on a sunny day.

The Vindskip was inspired by merchant sailing ships (stock image of the clipper Star of India) as well as airfoils used in the aerospace industry to lift aircraft and travel forward, using wind power and built-in engines
