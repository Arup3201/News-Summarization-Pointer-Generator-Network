Thirteen illegal immigrants have been found in a tanker containing plastic granules at Dover's Eastern Docks, in Kent.

The men, eleven from Syria and two from Afghanistan, were fit and well when Border Force and Home Office immigration enforcement officers attended yesterday.

No action is being taken against the tanker's driver.

They are the latest group to be detained at Dover amid concerns from the British freight industry about migrants' increasingly desperate attempts to reach the UK from Calais.

 All 13 migrants will be interviewed and passed into the care of the county's social services department if they are found to be minors.

The Freight Transport Association (FTA) has described the number of migrants attempting to enter the country illegally as a 'worsening situation'.

They are now calling on the European Union to bring in stricter border controls to deal with the problem.

More than 3,000 people have signed an e-petition demanding the UK Government helps solve the problems faced by British truckers.

On September 4, scores of illegal migrants in the French port of Calais tried to force their way onto a ferry bound for England. 

The desperate migrants had tried to run up the MyFerryLink ship. About 85 people had forced their way through a gate and climbed over fences, overpowering security staff.

But they were foiled when crew raised the ramp before they could get to the ferry.

In the second wave, 150 illegal immigrants gained entrance to the port but were stopped by police.

Recently, French police have tried to break up the camps of illegal immigrants around Calais, but the migrants claim they have nowhere to go.

They want fines of up to £2,000 per migrant, imposed on lorry drivers and hauliers if stowaways are caught hiding in their vehicles, to be abolished.

Truckers have complained about armed attacks from people trying to board vehicles destined for the UK.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'We work closely with the police to tackle illegal immigration and continue to strengthen the security of our border to stop those who have no right to enter the UK.

'If people have a genuine need of protection they should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach.

'If they are just seeking to evade immigration control they need to know that they are risking their lives and that they will get caught.

'The new Immigration Act makes it harder for people to live in the UK illegally.

'It makes it harder for illegal immigrants to abuse our benefits and public services, and makes it easier for us to remove them by reducing the number of appeals.'
