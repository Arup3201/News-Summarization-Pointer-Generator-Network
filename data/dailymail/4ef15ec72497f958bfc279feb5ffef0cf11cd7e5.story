The mother of a four-year-old killed in a fire was ‘screaming for her little boy’ as her house went up in flames, according to a neighbour.

A 10-year-old boy was rescued in the house fire near Bradford, West Yorkshire yesterday and is recovering in hospital, but his younger brother could not be saved. Police have now named the victim as Nathan Harrison.

Neighbour Julie Mitchell, 35, has today told of the moment the boy’s mother raised the alarm.

Scene: Nathan Harrison, died in hospital after inhaling fumes from the fire which began in the bedroom of his West Yorkshire family home

A ten-year-old boy is recovering in hospital after neighbours spotted smoke pouring from the back bedroom window of the house in Keighley, West Yorkshire

‘She came round calling for help. She was screaming for her little boy,’ said Ms Mitchell.

‘The fire brigade turned up and ambulance took him away on a stretcher.

‘I can’t get it out of my head. I just keep seeing his little boy coming out of the house.

‘It’s so sad, he was the same age as my little girl.

‘He and his brother were just cheeky little blond haired boys. They would play football together in the garden.

‘I didn’t know them as they had only been here for a couple of months, but my heart goes out to them. It must be so painful for the whole family.’

The
 two boys had been brought out of the house by the time police arrived 
and both were taken to hospital with serious injuries from smoke 
inhalation, West Yorkshire Police said.

Emergency services were called to a 
house in Keighley, near Bradford, just after 2pm yesterday after smoke 
was seen coming from a rear bedroom at the property in Sunnyhill Grove.

A woman, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘There was flashing lights everywhere.

‘There were three fire engines, two ambulances and a first responder.

‘We could see smoke coming out of the upstairs window, but then we saw this little boy coming out on a stretcher.

Police investigating the fire have described it as 'a tragic incident' and said a full investigation will be carried out

‘It was such a sad sight to see. No parent should have to go through that.

‘We didn’t know the family but we would see the boys playing outside together, with not a care in the world.

‘It must have been terrible for him, but I hope he is now at peace.’

A police officer remains on guard outside the detached property where the fire broke out.

The cause of the fire, which was confined to the bedroom, is being investigated.

The fire service confirmed that the property was fitted with two smoke alarms, but it is still being investigated as to whether they were operational at the time the fire broke out.

Dave Walton, Assistant Chief Fire Officer for West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue, said: ‘On attending we found two boys, aged ten and four, being brought out of the house. Both were taken to hospital with smoke inhalation.

‘The ten-year-old is now recovering from his injuries which are not life-threatening. Sadly, the four-year-old died in hospital.

‘The cause of the fire which was contained to the back bedroom, remains under investigation. Initial enquiries are underway with the colleagues form the police, and are at a very early stage.

‘Clearly this has been a tragic incident in which a young child has lost his life and a full investigation will be carried out.’
