Rob Lowe's vacation home in Grasse, France, was almost washed away by a massive storm on Wednesday.

The 50-year-old actor, his wife and son had to be rescued as raging floods submerged the first floor of their holiday residence.

The family, who are on a European vacation, were evacuated by rescuers after a huge storm poured down three months of rainfall in less than four hours creating freak floods.

Actor
 Rob Lowe and his wife were involved in a dramatic rescue on Wednesday 
morning after they were caught up in severe flooding in France.

Rob and Johnny set out for a European holiday two weeks ago with some of the boy's friends, with the recent high school graduate even notifying his online followers of the planned vacation days in advance.

The young man posted a dinner portrait of him and his buddies with the caption: 'Euro tripping with these boys? Leaving in 4 days? Ya, that's gonna be fine. #countingdown'.

The father and son looked to be having a great time, posting snaps from Barcelona, the South of France, and London.

And soon after they were in Spain, as the young man posted: 'Just a quick #Barcelona selfie with these boys @nickbarrack @rhl64 #almostafullcrew'.

The photos from the Spanish leg of the tour sees the duo enjoying dinners with Johnny's friends and spending long days on yachts.

But that all came to an abrupt end on Wednesday when the storm hit.

Johnny is the actor's youngest son, who he shares with Sheryl Berkoff.

Rob married
 Sheryl in July 1991 after meeting her in 1983 on a blind date. He met 
her once again in 1989 on the set of his film Bad Influence.

His eldest son Matthew, born in 1993, appears to not have gone on vacation with his father and younger brother.

The
 holiday seems to be a graduation present for finishing high school, as Johnny posted a picture in May of himself and his school friends with the
 caption: 'Made it. #4yearslater #missingone'.
