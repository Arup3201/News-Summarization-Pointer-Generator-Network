Just days after the tragic crash of a Virgin spaceship that left one pilot dead, the company has released a photo showing they are hard at work on a new vessel. 

In a picture taken in Mojave, California, the shell of a new SpaceShipTwo is shown as it is carefully being constructed by a team from Virgin.

At the same time, the company has announced they will be resuming tests of their experimental rocket-powered spaceship in 2015.

The team has already spent a good two years hard at work in the company's assembly facility building the ship, dubbed SpaceShipTwo Serial No. 2, which will now replace the destroyed version.

According to Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides, this new ship could be tested in as soon as six months.

'There was no question it was a tragic setback, but it's one from which we can recover,' said Whitesides. 

'With Serial No. 2, we'll be putting a stronger, even better ship into initial commercial service and I think we'll be able to get back into test flights soon and carry forward.' 

In the meantime, the team at Virgin will still be able to fly and test their mother ship WhiteKnightTwo, as federal investigators look into the cause of Friday's deadly crash.

That crash left pilot Michael Alsbury, 39, dead, and his co-pilot, Peter Siebold, injured.

Siebold somehow managed to escape the crash with nothing more than a broken shoulder, this after falling 50,000 feet with nothing but a parachute.

He was discharged from the hospital on Monday.

The investigation into what caused the crash could take up to a year.
