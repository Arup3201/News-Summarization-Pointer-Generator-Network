Taking to the stage just after watershed, Kanye was introduced on the stage by his wife Kim Kardashian.

Dressed in an all-black ensemble, the stage was full of a mob of people and was mainly illuminated by a flame thrower.

While there were two blow-torches on stage, it seems a mishap meant that only one torch worked during the performance as Kanye rapped alongside artists Allan Kingdom and Theophilus London on the track produced by Velous and French Montana.

While the audience at London’s 02 arena were able to take in the full performance, viewers at home were unable to hear most of the track as ITV attempted to mute the explicit lyrics.

The 'Audio Muted' sign in the corner of the screen signalled that ITV bosses were ordering the sound to be turned off.

An ITV spokesperson told MailOnline: 'ITV took the decision to use an audio mute during the performance. The Brits is broadcast live on ITV from 8pm to a wide audience. 

'We have operated a short time delay as standard practice for some years on the show, to allow us to mute language that may be inappropriate for that wide audience, and elected to do so in this case, given the performance took place shortly after the 9pm watershed.' 

However, at one point one of the rappers was heard saying the word, ‘s***’, as well as the few times that that N-word slipped through the muting.

JULIEN MACDONALD Autumn/Winter 2015

Fresh off the runway!

His autumn/winter 2015 collection has barely left the catwalk at London Fashion Week and its already proven a huge hit with fashionista A-listers, with Taylor Swift and now Kim Kardashian both wearing designs from Julien Macdonald’s fall line.

Unlike many of the latest collections embracing wide-leg styles and loose-fitting dresses, celebs have proved that the bodycon and skintight fit is yet to reach a demise with Julien Macdonald’s form-fitting collection already impressing the stars. After Taylor wowed at the Elle Style Awards in a deep green satin gown, Kim thought she’d try her hand at wearing the British designer and sport a one-piece cut out jumpsuit which clung to her famously voluptuous frame.

Reminiscent of Mark Fast’s previous collections, this stringy lace-like jumpsuit flattered Kim’s hourglass figure and created a slimline silhouette – much to our surprise seeing as legging-style jumpsuits can often look unflattering.

Additionally, we’re impressed that Kim is still risk-taking and shocking  us when it comes to her style, and we hope the nude co-ordinates are behind her for good now she’s worn this edgy fashion-forward one piece. As you’ve probably assumed, this jumpsuit is not available to buy just yet, but you can take inspiration from Kim’s red carpet style and check out our favourite black lace jumpsuits in the edit below from Nasty Gal, Anthropologie, Asos and more.

The song features the n-word 39 times and lyrics include: 'Ye in the building like a hallway, n****, Big in the game like an arcade, n****, I jump in the whip, Audi R8, n****, Still got the 100 with the small face, n****'. 

Kanye reportedly kept the song so secret ahead of his performance that only his inner-circle were allowed to watch rehearsals.

Lionel Ritchie was seen staring at the stage with a confused expression as he tried to make sense of the performance while Taylor Swift was spotted staring open-mouthed at the scenes before her.

But she soon got back into her usual award show behavior as she was seen dancing away to the track on a slightly different beat compared to Kim Kardashian who was stood next to her. 

However, at one point one of the rappers was heard saying the word, ‘s***’, as well as the few times that that N-word slipped through the muting
