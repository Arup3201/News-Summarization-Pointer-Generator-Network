An Ohio driver who made an online 
video confessing to causing a fatal wrong-way crash after a night of heavy drinking today pleaded not guilty.

But attorneys for 22-year-old Matthew Cordle, from Powell, Ohio, said the plea is just preliminary and a procedural step allowing
a judge to be appointed at random to accept a guilty plea.

The 
attorneys said their client still plans to plead guilty as soon as 
possible to accept responsibility for killing Vincent Canzani in June this year.

Franklin 
County Judge Julie Lynch told ABC News that Cordle's attorneys are trying to play the system by entering the not guilty plea.

In court: Matthew Cordle, pictured in court on Tuesday, has entered a surprising not guilty plea in his case. Just last week he confessed to a killing in a YouTube video - but a judge said the plea is a courtroom tactic

Defense strategy: Cordle's attorney, Martin Midian (right), said his client would likely plead not guilty at his arraignment, but he still intends to plead guilty at a later date

Under Ohio law, entering a guilty plea locks in the judge which in this case is Lynch.

But
she said she believes Cordle's team played the tactic after she told 
them this week that she did not know how she'd sentence Cordle, who 
faces between two to eight-and-a-half years in prison.

It comes after Cordle's lawyers on Tuesday denied they had decided to look for a different judge, a process
known as judge shopping, which is banned by court rules.

Cordle had posted a 3 1/2-minute 
video confession last Thursday where he admitted to be responsible for a
fatal hit-and-run accident June 22 that left a 61-year-old man dead.

Dramatic: Franklin County 
Judge Julie Lynch said she thinks his lawyers are hoping for a new judge

‘My name is Matthew Cordle, and on June 22nd, 2013, I hit
and killed Vincent Canzani,’ he said somberly. ‘This video will act as my
confession.’

Cordle is charged with aggravated vehicular homicide and a misdemeanor count of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol.

The preliminary plea came after Lynch 
didn't allow Cordle to go ahead with a plea Tuesday, saying his 
lawyers didn't follow court procedures. She has set a combined $255,000 bond.

Following
Wednesday's hearing, Cordle's attorneys said it is possible the guilty 
plea could still happen Wednesday, but would depend on how quickly a 
judge is assigned.

Judge Lynch ended the hearing shortly after it began on Tuesday. She said an expected arrangement whereby Cordle would plead guilty and be sentenced had changed - a move she described as 'nothing unusual.'

'I'm sorry you all came to this whole, big thing,' Lynch told reporters in a tone taken by many as sarcastic, NBC News reported.

She added, 'If we do not remain an independent judiciary with three branches of government, then we are doomed,' before leaving the courtroom.

Cordle's video was filmed September 3. It begins with Cordle's face
blurred as he describes how he has struggled with depression and was simply
trying to have a good time with friends going ‘from bar to bar’ the night of
the accident.

Video confession: The 3.5 minute video starts out with his face blurred and voice altered as he explains how he was driving drunk when he killed someone

Moment of truth: Matthew Cordle identifies himself when the effects are taken away and says that he will plead guilty to any charges that he faces stemming from the June 22 accident

His pledge: Cordle, 22, said that he was fully aware of the legal implications of making the video

He then describes how he ended up driving into oncoming
traffic on Interstate 670. Cordle's face becomes clear as he reveals his name
and confesses to killing Canzani.

He ends the video by pleading with viewers not to drink and
drive.

'I can't bring Mr. Canzani back, and I can't erase what I've
done, but you can still be saved. Your victims can still be saved,' Cordle
says.

Then a message appears on the darkened screen: 'Make the promise to never
drink and drive.'

The victim's daughter spoke out against Cordle, saying that the reason he made the confession publicly was so that he could try to get a lighter prison sentence.

Angela Canzani believes Matthew Cordle, who says he hit and killed Vincent Canzani, 61, on June 22 in, was ‘totally misleading’ with his confession because he was already suspected of the crime.

Victim: Vincent Canzani was 61 at the time of his death (pictured recently at right) and previously served in the Navy (seen in his uniform in an undated photo at left)

‘There was a traffic cam. There was a 
third car involved,’ Canzani told NBC News. ‘So people are kind of 
looking at this like he’s just coming out of nowhere…Like he’s some hero
or something.’

But on Friday, the
ex-wife of Mr Canzini told MailOnline she 'applauded' the decision of 
Cordle - who now faces criminal charges brought by the county prosecutor.

Cordle
says in the video he 'made a mistake' when he decided to drive his 
truck home after 'drinking heavily' and hit the other car, killing Mr 
Canzani, of suburban Columbus.

An obituary for Mr Canzani says that he served as a missile technician for a submarine from 1980 to 1986.

Since leaving the Navy, he flourished 
as 'a gifted photographer' and was survived by two daughters and three 
great grandchildren.

The video was released in conjunction with a not-for-profit start up called Because I Said I Would, which is focused around having individuals make commitments to themselves and their goals using index cards.

A fan: Cleveland kidnap victim Gina DeJesus posed for a picture with the group's shirt after the founder met with her mother

Its website says that it aims to become a 'a social movement dedicated to bettering humanity through the power of a promise'.

The organization was founded by Alex Sheen who was inspired by his father, who died of lung cancer last September. At his father's funeral, they handed out promise cards in tribute to how his father always kept his promises.

In a message that was posted on the group's website when the confession video was published, Mr Sheen says that Mr Cordle was the one to reach out to him via Facebook message about the hit-and-run.

'After getting to know Matt, I can say with confidence that he truly regrets his decision that night. He describes the guilt he has as “insurmountable,”' Mr Sheen wrote in the post.

'Against all legal advice, Matthew decided to make this video and release it prior to any charges being filed against him. His goal is to raise awareness about the terrible consequences that drunk driving can have on innocent people.'

Cordle's confession is not the only high-profile action the group has been involved with. 

After the three young women were 
discovered in Ariel Castro's Cleveland home, Mr Sheen was moved to 
launch a ten-day walking campaign across the state in their honor.

Movement: The group's founder, Alex Sheen (seen closest to the camera) was inspired to go on a 10-day state-wide walk to raise awareness for sexual abuse victims after DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight were found

Big finish: He ended the walk by being greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother at the site of the 'House of Horrors', which is just six miles away from where Sheen lives

He said that he lives six miles away from the now-razed 'House of Horrors' and was moved by the girls' perseverance.

He used the walk as a way to raise awareness about sexual assault, and at the end, he was greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother.

Mr Sheen gave her a number of t-shirts with the organization's name printed on them, and in return, she later sent him a picture of Gina wearing the shirt.
