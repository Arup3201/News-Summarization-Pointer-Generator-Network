As the fallen leader of one of America's biggest foes, Kim Jong-Il would have been prominent on any U.S. intelligence watch-list.

But still North Korea’s ‘dear leader' managed to pass away on a train on Saturday night without the outside world knowing for a whole two days.

The remarkable intelligence blunder has left the world pondering the lack of American intelligence on one of the world's most secretive nations.

Until a North Korean state TV announcement on Monday, South Korean officials had no idea Kim had died at 8:30pm on Saturday.

Cautious U.S. officials were still quoting press reports well into 
Monday.

The intelligence delay and failure to pick up on any clues shows the level of secrecy in the North Korean regime, reported the New York Times.

South Korean officials only found out what happened when North Korean state media reported the news in a 12pm announcement on Monday.

'This shows a big loophole in our intelligence-gathering network on North Korea,' South Korean politician Kwon Seon-taek told the New York Times.

Kim, who was aged 69, kept the rest of the world on edge through his nuclear weapons programme after inheriting power from his father in 1994.

He frustrated the U.S. and other global 
powers with an intermittent approach to talks on giving up nuclear arms 
in return for energy.

North Korea's news agency reported he 
died after having a heart attack and had been treated for cardiac and 
cerebrovascular diseases.

Kim, who reputedly had a taste for cigars and cognac, is believed to have suffered a stroke in 2008. His son Kim Jong Un has taken over.

But he had appeared relatively vigorous in footage from recent trips to China and Russia and in visits around the country seen on state media.

His military's repeated threats to South Korea and the U.S. stoked worries that fighting might break out again on the Korean peninsula.

Meanwhile his long-time pursuit of nuclear weapons raised concerns he might provide weapons of mass destruction to terrorist movements.

Mourners: The body of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il is seen as people pay their respects in Pyongyang, North Korea, on Tuesday

The Korean War ended more than 50 years ago in a ceasefire, and the two sides remain technically in a state of war.

South Korea has accused Kim of masterminding a 1983 bombing that killed 17 South Korean officials visiting Burma, now known as Myanmar.

Kim often blamed the U.S. for his country's troubles and his regime routinely derides South Korea as a puppet of the Western superpower.

‘Look, Kim Jong-Il is a dangerous person,’ President Bush said in 2005. ‘He's a man who starves his people. He's got huge concentration camps.’
