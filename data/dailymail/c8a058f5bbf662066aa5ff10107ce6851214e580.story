These incredible images show how the biggest and brightest moon for 20 years lit up the sky last night.

The 'supermoon' appeared 16 per cent bigger and 30 per cent brighter than normal as it reached the point in its orbit closest to the Earth, known as 'perigee'. 

Many enthusiasts grabbed their mobile phones to take a snapshot of the glimmering spectacle - which also came at the start of the Perseid meteor shower.

Stargazers around the world, including in London, New York, Beijing, Sydney and Rio de Janeiro, looked up into the night sky to catch a glimpse of the phenomenon.

Supermoons, which are known to cause higher tides, occur every 13 months and 18 days, but are not always noticed because of cloudy weather. Last night it was just 221,765 miles from Earth

This year there are five supermoons, two new moons in January and full moons in July, August and September. The spectacular glow created by the bright moon sparked a deluge of comments on Twitter over night. 

One user said he was 'dumbstruck' by the spectacle while another wrote: 'Check out the supermoon. Hopefully it's clear where you are. It looks amazing here around Cambridge.'

A supermoon occurs when the moon is both 'full' and at its closest point to Earth.

Astronomers call this phenomenon a 'perigee moon,' which describes the full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth each year.

Perigee marks the closest point a body reaches as it orbits around its host object such as Earth, while apogee marks the farthest point from its parent body.

Almost every orbit has an apogee and perigee because orbits tend to be elliptical rather than perfectly circular, so even Earth has an apogee and perigee around the sun.

Last night the supermoon was 16 per cent bigger and 30 per cent brighter as it passed Earth 221,765 miles away. Although they occur every 13 months and 18 days, they are not always noticed because of cloudy weather.

This year there are five supermoons, two new moons in January and full moons in July, August and September.
