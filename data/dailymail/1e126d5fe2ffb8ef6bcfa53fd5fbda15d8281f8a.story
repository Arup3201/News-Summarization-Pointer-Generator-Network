An ambulance service has apologised to an elderly woman suffering a brain haemorrhage who was forced to wait for almost an hour and a half for an emergency crew to arrive.

Christine Campbell, 64, started feeling sick and getting headaches before collapsing at her home in Purbrook, Hampshire, prompting family members to immediately dial 999.

However, an ambulance failed to reach the grandmother until 86 minutes later, during which time her concerned family made two more 999 calls.

Following an investigation into the incident, it emerged an ambulance originally dispatched to Mrs Campbell was diverted elsewhere.

The enquiry also found the worker who took their call failed to find out enough about Mrs Campbell’s condition before deciding how best to treat the situation.

The family spoke to an NHS 111 call handler tasked to receive 999 calls from the public and take essential details about the patient’s condition and their exact location.

However, the investigation found Mrs Campbell’s condition should have been ‘further probed’ over the phone. That worker has now been given further training.

South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) has now written to her husband Chris Campbell - who has had to quit his career to become her full-time carer - to offer its ‘sincere apologies’.

Mr Campbell, 63, a coach driver for the Ministry of Defence, said: ‘I’m not very happy. It seems SCAS is just going through the motions to keep me happy.

‘It seems they are just making excuses for their incompetence. That said, however, there’s not a lot of point in pursuing the matter any further as SCAS isn’t going to change what it’s already said and we’ll just have to accept this and get on with it.

‘Hopefully SCAS will take more care with the way calls are handled.’

Since her collapse at her £87,000 one-bedroom flat home in Purbrook, Mrs Campbell has continued to receive hospital treatment for her brain haemorrhage.

In fact, Mr Campbell had been admitted to hospital hours before his wife, who retired in May, after being diagnosed with pneumonia and pleurisy.

The couple, who have two children and five grandchildren together, were both eventually transferred from Queen Alexandra Hospital to Southampton General Hospital.

When his wife fell ill, their daughter Claire, 40, who lives nearby in North End, Portsmouth, was able to drive to their home and call 999 - which she then did twice more.

A little over a week after being first admitted to hospital, Mrs Campbell, a former medical secretary, had brain surgery and was kept at Southampton General for three weeks. After coming out, she was re-admitted several weeks later when she suffered from vertigo, her husband said.

He added: 'Luckily they were very good at the hospital. I don't believe the delay impacted on her condition and she's been improving steadily.

‘I myself had chest pains that morning and went to hospital but Christine messaged me to say she was ill. Our daughter came round from North End who called for the ambulance.

‘It's been a little bit awkward these past four months as I have been doing everything for her and running around after her. Fortunately it's not so bad now as she's getting more mobile. It's not how we planned to start our retirement together.’ 

In a letter to Mr Campbell, who complained about the treatment of his wife, the ambulance trust admitted failing to meet the targeted response time of 30 minutes.

It admitted the first call was made at 11.53am on September 7 this year by Mrs Campbell’s family and that a clinician called the family back at 12.40pm when they were able to do so.

The clinician told the family an ambulance would be sent out and with them within 30 minutes and one was dispatched at 1.05pm. But it was diverted to another emergency just two minutes later at 1.07pm.

At 1.12pm another ambulance was sent and reached Mrs Campbell at 1.19pm, 39 minutes after the family was told one was coming and 86 minutes after the first 999 call.

Eventually, she was taken to and treated at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Cosham, Hampshire, after her family had made a total of three separate 999 calls.

In its apology for its shortfalls, SCAS also said a rapid response vehicle was not sent out throughout this time as none were available.

Luci Stephens, assistant director of operations, wrote to her husband: ‘I would firstly like to offer you my sincere apologies for the distress caused because of this incident, not only for your wife but also to you and your daughter who was with your wife at the time.

‘I would also like to apologise for the delay in responding to you.’
