A fighting bull has gored three people and spread panic in a hair-raising final running of the bulls at Spain's San Fermin festival.

Hundreds of people dashed alongside the six bulls through the cobblestone streets of Pamplona in Monday's eighth run.

There were spine-chilling moments when one bull, named Olivito, separated from the pack and charged three runners, two Australians and a Spaniard, pinning them against walls and barriers while trying to gore them.

One of the injured Australian men is understood to be James Metcalfe, a 24-year-old from Grenfell in New South Wales who was gored in the right thigh. He has since been released from hospital.

Australian man Jason Gilbert, 26, underwent surgery at a hospital in the northern town of Pamplona after being gored in the chest, abdomen and thigh on Monday

The 595kg bull became separated from the herd after it slipped and crashed headlong into a wall. Seeming disorientated, it then charged a group of runners who thought they had avoided the stampede.

It then set its sights on one young man, believed to be a 26-year-old Australian called J.G., repeatedly butting him and pinning him against a wall.

As the man lifted his legs in a bid to protect himself from the onslaught, the bull thrust one of its horns through his left thigh, tearing off a large chunk of flesh.

He managed to escape to safety behind a wooden barrier, but not before the furious bull gored him again as he clambered over the fence at which point he was taken to hospital for surgery.

Festival spokeswoman Lucinda Poole described his condition as 'grave' having suffered injuries to his chest, abdomen and his left thigh.

'He is being operated on in traumatology in the hospital complex and they say the condition is grave, which translated to English probably means extremely serious,' Ms Poole said.

A 21-year-old Spaniard from Navarra was also gored three times.

The bull broke away from the pack and charged several runners, including Mr Gilbert who is seen hear being lifted off the ground by the bull's horns during the eighth run at Spain's famous San Fermin festival

Navarra hospital's Dr. Oscar Gorria said two men were gored in the legs. He said five people were also hospitalized for other injuries. There were no immediate details on their identities. 

Fellow Australian Nicholas Kordahi told Sydney radio station Triple M's The Grill Team he was also at the running of the bulls when he was charged by one of the beasts, sustaining injuries to his side and ankle.

Mr Kordahi shot some footage of the moment the animal made its way towards him and his friends, and described it on air as 'one of the most adrenaline fueling scariest moments I've ever had in my life. Me and my two friends were shaking before the gun went.'

Several men have already been gored by bulls during this year's festival but Monday's run, the eighth and last, was particularly brutal.

One of the six bulls broke away from the others and charged several runners, lifting two of them off the ground on its horns and ripping through their legs.

Other participants tried to distract the bull and eventually herded it into the ring. The runs usually last between three to five minutes, and the bulls then appear in an evening bullfight, when they are killed.

Mr Gilbert had only arrived in Pamplona just 24 hours before he was injured with three friends he is travelling around Europe with

Finally, with the help of a few police officers, Mr Gilbert managed to get behind the fence where he was promptly taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries

Five other men were injured in Monday's run.

Nine men were still in hospital on Sunday recovering from injuries from the past week, according to the Navarra region's hospital authorities.

One of them was Bill Hillmann, an American who co-wrote a book called 'Fiesta: How To Survive The Bulls of Pamplona'. He was gored in the thigh after he tripped and fell.

Many participants drink and dance all night before taking part in the 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) event, though local authorities have tried to clamp down on reckless behaviour in recent years.

Ouch! There were spine-chilling moments when one bull separated from the pack and charged three runners, pinning them against walls and barriers while trying to gore them

Dangerous selfie: Spanish media said over the weekend that Pamplona police were looking for a young man who was seen trying to get a dangerous 'selfie' photo of himself on his phone as he ran inches in front of the bulls

Spanish media said over the weekend that Pamplona police were looking for a young man who was seen trying to get a dangerous 'selfie' photo of himself on his phone as he ran inches in front of the bulls.

He could be fined up to 3,000 euros ($4,100) if they find he endangered other runners.

A 27-year-old man from Madrid was the last person to be killed during a Pamplona bull run after being gored in the neck in 2009. There have been 14 fatalities over the past century at the fiesta, which dates back to the 13th century and was depicted in Ernest Hemingway's novel 'The Sun Also Rises'.
