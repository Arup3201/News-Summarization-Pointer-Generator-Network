Tyson Fury stands poised on Saturday night between the pinnacle of a mega-fight with world heavyweight supremo Wladimir Klitschko and the abyss of absurdly premature retirement, at just 26.

The giant Manchester traveller can nail down a multi-world title challenge to Klitschko with an impressive victory over Christian Hammer at London’s O2 Arena.

Alternatively, Fury is vowing to hang up the gloves if he loses to his little-known and lightly-regarded German opponent.

The prospect of Fury being granted his wish of taking on Klitschko, the long-time holder of all but one of the heavyweight belts, will be strengthened by the presence at ringside of American TV mogul Ken Hershman.

The president of sports for the giant HBO cable TV network has flown to London to evaluate the box office potential of Klitschko v Fury.

Hershman comes to town just as promoter Frank Warren has agreed a Fury-Klitschko fight in September.

Warren says: ‘I have no doubt that this fight will happen now. We are looking at a football stadium in September.’

Tempers flared as the two heavyweights and their entourages clashed at the weigh-in

Whether that open-air spectacular takes place here or in Germany remains a matter of on-going negotiations.

Warren always tries to secure home advantage for his boxers but Klitschko has regularly been drawing 60,000-plus crowds to football stadiums in his adopted Germany throughout his 10-year reign as the titular heavyweight champion.

As their man is champion, Team Klitschko will carry greater weight in such decisions.

All depends, of course, on Fury not being caught out by his occasional vulnerability to meaty blows to his chin and Hammer vows: ‘I’m coming to spoil the party by knocking him out.’

Fury should handle Hammer comfortably, however, and he knows it. He says: ‘If I can’t beat this guy I have no place even thinking about fighting Klitschko. If I were to lose this one there would be no point me carrying on. I would give up boxing.’

Yet he needs to keep active in the ring, especially given a long spell of inactivity following the cancellation of two big dates with David Haye.

‘Boxing is a risk business,’ he says. ‘I need the fights.’

These best-laid plans would also collapse if Klitschko were to lose to unbeaten American Bryant Jennings in a voluntary defence of his titles at New York’s iconic Madison Square Garden on April 25.

That, too, is highly unlikely but with the heavyweights one punch can change the world order.

But unless that happens Fury will not face US knock-out sensation Deontay Wilder, who has just won the WBC world title which is the only belt not in Wlad the Impaler’s possession, before challenging Klitschko.

Warren says: ‘Wladimir will be first for Tyson, although Wilder is another big fight waiting to happen after that.’

Eubank Jnr and Chudinov show off their physiques during the weigh-in at the 02

Chris Eubank Jr would appear to face a somewhat sterner test at the 02 than Fury.

The son of Eubank challenges Dmitry Chudinov for the WBA interim middleweight title.

But although most of Eastern Europe seems to fancy the Russian’s chances, his lack of speed and mobility ought to be ideal for Eubank and I expect him to join Fury in the winner’s enclosure, both by mid-fight stoppage.

Carl Frampton should make it a clean Saturday night sweep for British boxing in the home-town Belfast defence of his world super-bantamweight title against Chris Avalos.

The Mexican-American is a born fighter but his slugging aggression leaves him an open target and Frampton, a natural counter-puncher, will likely break him down inside eight or nine rounds.

As Frampton brings boxing the welcome boost of a return to mainstream terrestrial broadcasting with ITV, that channel and BoxNation are trying to finesse times so that viewers can watch Eubank and then Fury immediately before switching to Frampton.

Chris Eubank Jnr also weighed in ahead of his fight with Dimtry Chudinov on Saturday

Fury-Hammer and Eubank-Chudinov will be live on BoxNation from 7 pm.

Frampton- Avalos will be live on ITV from 10 pm, preceded by the undercard on ITV 4.
