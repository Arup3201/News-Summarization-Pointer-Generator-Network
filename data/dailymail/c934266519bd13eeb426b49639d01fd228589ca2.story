Friends of a missing 27-year-old man who launched a massive search effort to find him have been ordered by a government agency to take down posters of his face because they can damage signs and distract drivers.

Dane Kowalski hasn't been seen since he withdrew $800 from his bank and left his Diamond Creek home in Victoria on December 12 for a fishing trip in Darwin.

His friends and family have spent the past month retracing his steps from Melbourne to Darwin looking for signs of Dane and putting up hundreds of missing person posters along the way.

But in a strange move, the search team received a letter from the Northern Territory roads department on Wednesday ordering them to remove the posters from its highways.

'It has been brought to my attention that you have posted a number of posters to road signs and other furniture within the Northern Territory Road Reserve,' the letter read.

'This damages our signs and has the potential to endanger the motoring public. 

'I request the immediate removal of all signs from NTG assets and to cease the placement of any further signage on this furniture.

'Non-compliance with this request may result in the removal of these by NTG contractors and cost recovery from responsible parties.'

Dane's search group continue to search the Northern Territory, South Australia and Victoria - they have vowed not to stop until they find the 27-year-old

It has left the group, who are using the hashtag #FindDane on social media, feeling 'disgusted'.

'This is absolutely ridiculous... obviously we are not going to take them down,' Dane's friend, Chris Carrig, told Daily Mail Australia.

'We're not bowing down to threats.

'It's been pretty hard to take and really disheartening to think someone is basically going against us on this considering the circumstances.'

The signs put up by the group are smaller than road signs and are made of cardboard or plywood.

'If he's up there, people driving are going to see the signs over and over... that's what will stick in their head,' Mr Carrig said.

A spokeswoman for the department told the ABC some of the posters had obscured speed and other signs and they would have to be taken down.

But they have since backed down and said they would not seek to recover the costs to have the posters removed. 

The department will now repost the signs in other areas, the spokeswoman said.

Dane's search group continue to search the Northern Territory, South Australia and Victoria - they are also trekking through off-roads in between Darwin and Melbourne.  

They have vowed not to stop until they find him.

In attempt to find Dane, friends have set up a website and started a social media campaign, as well as printing shirts and stickers with his face on them. 

One of Dane's best friends, who has been friends with him since the age of 12, is so desperate to find him that he has offered a $25,000 reward from his own pocket for any information. 

Brittany Taylor, the partner of Dane's best friend Anthony Hudson, told Daily Mail Australia that the missing man's family and friends were beside themselves with worry.

'No one has heard a word. There's been nothing since then (December 12); his phone hasn't been touched, his bank account hasn't been touched, social media – nothing,' Ms Taylor said.

'He's missed Christmas, his god-daughter's birthday, some really vital things that we knew he was looking forward to. It's so out of character. It's not unusual for him to travel, but it is unusual for him not to check in.

'Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess, everyone's doing everything they can, everyone's breaking down and trying to support each other.'

'He's missed Christmas, his god-daughter's (pictured) birthday - some really vital things that we knew he was looking forward to. It's so out of character...Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess,' Brittany Taylor, the partner of Mr Kowalski's best friend Anthony Hudson, said 

Dane is described as being of Caucasian appearance, approximately 185cm tall, of athletic build with blue eyes and undercut brown hair. He was driving a white 2004 Holden Rodeo ute with the registration WN114. Anyone who sees Dane is urged to contact Triple Zero (000) immediately

Dane hasn't touched his phone, bank account or social media accounts since he went missing

His friends and family have considered hiring a plane in Darwin for a more thorough search.

'My partner put that reward money - $25,000 - out of his own pocket. He's desperate to have his best friend back home. If someone knows something or they've seen something - we're desperate,' Ms Taylor said.

One of the many psychics, who responded to the social media campaign, told Dane's family that he may have stopped to help someone whose car was hit by a kangaroo before a scuffle broke out and his car was taken.

It's just one of the many lead's his desperate family has followed up, including checking road tolls and phone records.

Ms Taylor and the rest of Mr Kowalski's friends and family have issued a plea of help to the public to help them find him.

'We don't think it's likely at all, but if he wants to be left alone we just want him to let us know he's okay. He's so missed and so loved and we're doing everything we can to get him home,' Ms Taylor said.

'He's one of the most amazing people you'll ever meet; he'd give you everything he had if he knew he could help you. You can't say a bad word about him, you really can't. He really loves life.'
