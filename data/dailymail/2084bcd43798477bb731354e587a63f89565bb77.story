Gary Cahill is reflecting on the challenge he faces in the next fortnight. On Saturday there is Mario Balotelli, the following Thursday it is Luis Suarez. For a defender who has never been to a major tournament before, it is some way to start.

‘I’ve said many times when I’ve come off the pitch, “I was unbelievable there for 87 minutes”,’ says Cahill. ‘And all of a sudden you switch off once, a cross comes in and he scores. It wrecks your whole game. That’s the nature of my position.

‘I wouldn’t say I come off the pitch and forget all about it because I don’t. It goes through my head. I replay it a lot but then, once you start your preparation for the next game, you want to go straight back out and play.’

Cahill, 28, is commendably light-hearted about the angst that comes with the job. Asked whether there is one error that haunts him, he laughs: ‘I was all right until you brought it up!’

It is one of the Chelsea defender’s strengths, the ability to remain upbeat. Dwelling on mistakes is hardly productive.

‘When goals go in, you always think, “What could you have done?”,’ he says. ‘Nine times out of 10 you are just in and around somewhere but if it is a blatant mistake, where you think, “Wow, that was totally down to me” then of course you have to learn from it. You try to make them as few as possible. Once in a blue moon, that’s the idea.’

So to Balotelli, the threat next Saturday in Manaus. The only certainty about the former Manchester City star is his capriciousness.

‘That’s dangerous isn’t it because you never know, will he turn up, will he not?’ says Cahill. ‘He’s got the potential to stick it into the top corner from 30 yards. He’s an unpredictable player but on his day he’s one of the best.

Out for the count: Cahill (centre) missed Euro 2012 after picking up an injury in a warm-up clash with Belgium

‘I played against him a couple of times at City and he’s been tough. I played against him another time when he came off after 60, 70 minutes. Unpredictable. He can be world class. They’re just dangerous players but you come up against them every game.’

Cahill’s England debut came four years ago at the age of 24 when he was part of the new wave of players coming in after the 2010 World Cup.

He might have been in South Africa but his run-up to selection was disrupted by a potentially fatal blood clot, which meant he had to have a rib removed and miss a chunk of the season.

He missed Euro 2012 when he broke his jaw in the last friendly, against Belgium at Wembley, before England flew out to Poland.

‘It’s my first tournament and I have waited a long time for it,’ says Cahill. ‘So for me to be involved in this is massive.’
