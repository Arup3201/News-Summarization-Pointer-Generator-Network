Aretha Franklin says Detroit's future is bright, saying that her hometown may be "bankrupt monetarily but we are well-funded in spirit and what it takes to come back'.

The 'Queen of Soul' had her publicist release a hopeful statement in light of the city's bankruptcy on Thursday.

She says 'between new and dynamic leadership with the Big Three, the private sector and a little help from D.C., Detroit's best and most glorious days are still ahead'.

Extreme: Detroit's emergency financial manager Kevyn Orr explains his decision to make the city file for bankruptcy

Living problems: It can take police nearly an hour to respond to a 911 call and despite razing close to 10,000 vacant houses, three times as many still stand with windows smashed and doors ripped off

The Big Three car manufacturers- Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler- were the companies that helped drive the Michigan city to its glory days in the 1950s and 1960s.

Now the city is a shadow of its former self, with a host of overwhelming bills that forced the mayor to declare the region bankrupt.

For decades, Detroit paid its bills by borrowing money while struggling to provide the most basic of services for its residents.

It can take police nearly an hour to respond to a 911 call and despite razing close to 10,000 vacant houses, three times as many still stand with windows smashed and doors ripped off.

At night, many streets and even freeways are dangerously shrouded in darkness because tens of thousands of street lights don't work.

The 1950s proved to be the truly bustling time for the car factories, like the Chrysler plant seen here in 1954

Proud of their products: The National Auto Show, seen here in 1960, was a spectacle and a way for the workers of the city to display their efforts

Before it broke: Even in 1993 the car industry was still in place, even though it had deteriorated to a shadow of its former self

The city was about to default on a good chunk of its $14billion-plus debt, but now it will get a second chance in a federal bankruptcy court-led restructuring.

Detroit's budget deficit this year alone is estimated at $380million, and Kevyn Orr, its state-appointed emergency manager, chose bankruptcy over diverting money from police, fire and other services to make debt payments.

The move conserves cash so the city can operate, but it will hurt Detroit's image for years. It also leaves creditors with pennies on the dollar and places in jeopardy the pension benefits of thousands of city retirees.

While the drastic move may seem quick, it took decades of decay to bring down the once-mighty industrial giant that put the world on wheels.

The city grew to 1.8 million people in the 1950s, luring them with plentiful jobs that paid good wages to stamp out automobiles for sale across the globe.

But like many American cities, Detroit's fall began late that decade as developers starting building suburbs. Then came the 1967 riots that accelerated the number of white residents who moved to the cities north of Eight Mile Road, considered the region's racial dividing line.

Rapper Eminem starred in the movie he created about the infamous road, bringing the notion of the tough streets surrounding Eight Mile to a national audience.

At the same time, auto companies began opening plants in other cities, and the rise of autos imported from Japan started to cut the size of the U.S. auto industry.

Detroit's property values fell, tax revenue dropped, police couldn't control a growing murder rate, and many middle-class blacks fled the city for safer suburbs with better schools.

Back when it was booming: The 'Seven Sisters' smokestacks (seen here in 1996) were a poignant display of how pivotal industry was to the heart of the city

Native sons: Singers Eminem and Kid Rock are both from the city, and Eminem made a movie about the infamous Eight Mile Road

By 2009, the auto industry collapsed along with the economy as a whole, eventually pulling the city down with it.

Government corruption under former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick only made things worse.

In the 2000 census, Detroit's population fell under 1 million in as the exodus continued. Today it's barely above 700,000.

Unlike a business that declares bankruptcy, the city faces a number of structural and logistical challenges that may impede a speedy recovery.

Structural issues: With so many abandoned and ransacked buildings, city administrators will likely have trouble bringing people back to the areas needed to have a flourishing city

Bust: After its boom years Detroit began a steady decline

Industry: Factories such as the Packard Automotive Plant, which helped Detroit become wealthy, are now abandoned

Whereas companies can cut departments and outsource to cheaper regions, Detroit can't send its decaying neighborhoods elsewhere.

Thousands of retired city workers could lose at least part of their pension benefits.

Concessions could be forced upon dozens of city unions, including pay and benefit cuts.

Creditors whom Detroit owes more than $14billion will have to take pennies on the dollar.

Desolate: The once-thriving city is struggling to convince residents to stay

That said, free of these financial burdens, Detroit will be able to concentrate its limited dollars on services such as basic police and fire protection. Better services could bring more people and lure more business investment.

Already the downtown and an area to the north called Midtown are seeing business and residential growth - signs that Detroit has a future.
