The pastel-coloured orchid mantis has fascinated naturalists for more than a century.

It was popularly thought that the insect, whose legs are flattened and heart-shaped to resemble petals, simply mimics an orchid, allowing it to 'hide' and catch prey.

But it's only now that scientists suggested that the mantis doesn’t simply blend into flowers, but is attractive to insects in its own right, sometimes preferring to remain more easily visible on leaves.

Pastel predator: Scientists have suggested that the orchid mantis (stock image) doesn't simply camoflague by sitting on orchids, but is attractive to insects in its own right, sometimes preferring to remain more easily visible on leaves

Naturalists had assumed that the orchid mantis (Hymenopus coronatus) had evolved to mimic the flower as a form of crypsis – enabling it to hide among its petals, feeding upon insects that are attracted by the flower, The Conversation reported.

Cryptic mimicry by predators is well known. For example, crab spiders camouflage themselves against a flower and can change from yellow to white to match their host flower.

While the orchid mantis does seem to fit into this category, there was no evidence to support the hypothesis.

Orchid mantises are rare in their native Malaysia and Indonesia, so their behaviour is hardly known about, except in captivity. 

For example, nobody knows exactly which flower the mantis is supposed to mimic, Dr James Gilbert, an insect evolutionary ecology expert at the University of Sussex wrote.

When paired alongside the most common flower in their habitat, insects approached mantises more often than flowers, showing that mantises are attractive to insects by themselves, rather than simply camouflaging among the flora, the study revealed.

The rare orchid mantis is native to rainforests in Southeast Asia.

Its four walking legs resemble flower petals.

The insect has evolved to mimic a generic flower, rather than an orchid.

The toothed front pair are used to grasp prey.

However, it doesn't 'hide' in similarly coloured flowers, but can attract insects in its own right.

Their bright colouring is thought to appeal to its prey.

The compact brains of insects use a rule of thumb - anything matching colour X is a nectar-containing flower – and the predator uses ‘sensory exploitation’ to catch its victims.

Orchid mantises show some of the most pronounced sexual dimorphism of any species of mantis, with males less than half the size of females.

Now a set of new studies shows that while the mantis does indeed look like a flower, it doesn’t hide in an orchid.

In fact, it doesn’t hide at all and doesn’t look particularly like an orchid to insects.

Dr James O'Hanlon of Macquarie University, Australia, set about systematically testing the ideas contained within the traditional view of the orchid mantis' modus operandi.

First, they tested whether mantises actually camouflage amongst flowers, or, alternatively, attract insects on their own.

For a flower-seeking insect, as predicted, the mantis' colour pattern is indistinguishable from most common flowers.

However, when paired alongside the most common flower in their habitat, insects approached mantises more often than flowers, showing that mantises are attractive to insects by themselves, rather than simply camouflaging among the flora.

‘We can clearly observe insects, like bees, diverging from their flight paths and flying right towards this deceptive predator,’ Dr O’Hanlon said.

Orchid mantises are actually very rare in the field, so their behaviour is hardly known about, except in captivity. For example, nobody knows exactly which flower the mantis is supposed to mimic. This stock image shows a pale yellow orchid mantis, ready to strike

‘These beasties are marvellous for this kind of question, because we can observe a dynamic interaction between predators and prey.’

This phenomenon, known as aggressive mimicry, occurs in other animals.

For example, the Bolas spider releases chemicals that imitate sex pheromones released by female moths seeking a mate.

The orchid mantis uses aggressive mimicry to attract dinner. The Bolas spider (stock image) uses this technique to release chemicals that imitate sex pheromones released by female moths seeking a mate. Male moths, can detect these pheromones from miles away and are lured in to their death

Male moths, with their elaborately plumed antennae, can detect these pheromones from miles away, and are lured in to their death.

Carnivorous Photuris firefly females can mimic the flash-responses of a different species of firefly, attracting amorous males who find themselves on the menu.

Next the researchers assessed where mantises chose to sit.

Surprisingly mantises did not choose to hide among the flowers and selected leaves just as often.

Sitting near flowers did bring benefits, though, because insects were attracted to the general vicinity.

When they compared the mantis’s shape and colour with flowers from an insect’s perspective, the predator did not resemble an orchid or indeed any particular species of flower, but rather a ‘generalised’ flower.

Photuris fireflies (SEM image shown) can mimic the flash-responses of a different species of firefly, attracting amorous males to their deaths.

This fits with what scientists already know: that some of the best mimics in nature are imperfect mimics with characteristics of several ‘model’ species.

Placing experimental plastic models out in the field, the researchers found that mantis colour was much more important than shape in attracting insects.

They believe that mantises may not actually precisely mimic a particular kind of flower.

Instead they may exploit a loophole created by evolutionary efficiency savings within the insect brain.

The compact brains of insects use a rule of thumb - anything matching colour X is a nectar-containing flower – and the predator uses ‘sensory exploitation’ to catch its victims.

Sensory exploitation is a concentrated mass of the right colour. The insect classifies the mantis as a giant nectar-filled flower and approaches to investigate – to its doom.

The white crab spider also lures prey using sensory exploitation.

It reflects strongly in UV light, making it highly conspicuous to wandering insects.

A flower with a crab spider is more attractive than one without, because the crab spider mimics UV-reflective floral patterns that guide insects to nectar.

But the orchid mantis is the first animal ever shown to mimic an entire flower, attracting insects on its own.

The findings have left experts questioning why the orchid mantis’ body parts resemble petals, if it can attract insects with its colour alone.

Commenting on the research, Martin Stevens, an expert on animal deception and mimicry at of Exeter University, said: ‘My guess is that the pollinators are initially attracted at a distance through sensory exploitation, but then more accurate mimicry kicks in at close range, when the insects can inspect the mantis more closely for what it is.’
