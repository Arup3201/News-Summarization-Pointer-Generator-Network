An alleged drugs gang stashed marijuana worth around $36m (£23m) under bogus tour buses and smuggled it into America in a massive trafficking ploy.

Compressed into bricks, it was hidden in special compartments under the vehicles before being brought across the border and deposited in a warehouse in Colorado.

Police believe the notorious Los Zetas gang, one of the most violent and feared Mexican drug cartels, sourced the marijuana.

Seized: £23 million worth of marijuana was stashed under bogus tour buses and smuggled into America. Police have now arrested 23 suspects in the U.S.

Some 23 suspects have now been charged over the operation and face a 96-count indictment.

The smuggling ring was uncovered when a motorist stopped by police in Colorado was found with narcotics in his possession and told detectives the name of his supplier.

A Colorado judge then approved telephone wire taps of the suspected dealer, triggering a year-long investigation by federal and state law enforcement which led to a grand jury indictment.

This was handed up last month but remained sealed until as many arrests as possible could be made.

Authorities assigned to the probe seized marijuana bricks - valued at $36 million in the U.S. -, along with two kilograms of cocaine valued at $64,000 (£40,000), 53 grams of methamphetamine, and $134,000 (£84,500) in cash.

Some 14 vehicles and seven firearms were also confiscated in raids.

The
96-count indictment accuses the gang of smuggling drugs weighing 
45,000lbs (20,400kg) from Durango, Mexico, through El Paso, Texas, to a 
Colorado warehouse for street sale between April 2010 and May of this 
year.

They are believed to have made the trip to Commerce City twice a week for the eleven-month period.

The alleged ringleaders, Conrado Arellano-Casas, 32, and Jose Jimenez-Chacon, 30, were among the suspects named on the indictment.

Jimenez-Chacon was arrested by U.S. Drug Enforcement agents in El Paso, Texas.Arellano-Casas was apprehended in Colorado, where investigators also seized a loaded AK-47 rifle and $30,000 (£19,000) in cash from his home.

The defendants face an array of criminal charges, ranging from racketeering, conspiracy, distribution of a controlled substance, criminal impersonation, and illegal possession of firearms.

Eighteen of the indicted suspects are in custody and five are believed to be in Mexico though their exact whereabouts are unknown.

Ten of the suspects are believed to be in the country illegally and are under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement holds.
