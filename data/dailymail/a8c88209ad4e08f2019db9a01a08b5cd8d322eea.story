Ryan Bertrand and Fraser Forster have lifted the lid on life with the Premier League's surprise package, Southampton.

Both summer signings in the wake of an exodus from St. Mary's, the England duo joined the club ahead of a season in which many predicted them to struggle.

But new boss Ronald Koeman has confounded critics to lead the Saints to second in the Premier League, for which Forster and Bertrand give their boss full credit.

'He is a great man manager. He speaks to each player and gives them a clear vision of what he wants from them and there is no doubt he has an aura about him,' Forster told ESPNFC.COM.

'The boss had a fantastic career as a player and when he speaks, people want to listen and learn from his experience.

'Whether it was because so many people were writing us off and we wanted to prove them wrong I don't know, but the manager has helped the process.

'Eating breakfast and lunch together brings people together and there is a real good feeling at this club. I sensed that from the moment I walked through the door.'

Bertrand, on loan from Chelsea, backed up his team-mate's praise for the Dutch boss.

He said: 'He has been upbeat from the first day I came to the club. He is a humble guy and has nothing to prove to anyone. He also has the respect of everyone and is not scared to take you aside and have a chat if you are doing something wrong.'

And the left-back, who won the Champions League with his parent club in 2012, believes his Saints form could see him brought back into the England fold.

'I would like to think I have chances of getting England call-ups if I'm playing regular Premier League football in a successful team and that is what we have at Southampton,' he said.

'It is difficult to catch the eye of an England manager if you are not playing at a big club like Chelsea.'
