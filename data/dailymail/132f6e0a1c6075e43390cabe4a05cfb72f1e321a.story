The brave policeman who arrested a knifeman in a mosque after being stabbed in the chest and stomach has described how he wrestled his knife-wielding attacker.

Pc Adam Koch, of West Midlands Police, suffered knife wounds to his back and side as he grappled with the man in a Birmingham mosque.

A 32-year-old local man, believed to be of Somali descent, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder following the attack late on Saturday.

The man allegedly stabbed the officer and three mosque worshippers after screaming: ‘Allah is going to punish you all'.

Despite suffering stab and slash injuries PC Koch managed to wrestle an attacker to the ground and eventually prise the knife from his grasp

The heroic officer convinced the  stab vest helped save his life, and praised the community for helping him

He remains in a secure mental health unit under assessment until deemed fit to be questioned, West Midlands Police said.

Pc Koch was one of the officers 
called to Madrassa Qasim Ul Uloom mosque in Washwood Heath Road at 11pm 
on Saturday after three worshippers were stabbed.

On arriving they found the suspect in
a side room and used a Taser on him; however, it had no effect and the 
attacker then lunged at Pc Koch 'with a commando-style knife'.

Speaking from his hospital bed today, the 31-year-old police constable said: 'He charged towards me with the knife.

'I can remember falling to the floor and wrestling with the man and he tried thrusting the knife into my back.

'I'm waiting to see the damage to my stab vest as I'm convinced it's helped save my life.

'I managed to grab hold of his wrist 
and eventually disarm him; it was only then that my partner told me I'd 
been stabbed and blood was running from my shirt.

The heroic policeman who arrested a knifeman after being stabbed in the chest and stomach has thanked doctors for 'putting him back together'

The injured officer used a West Midlands Police Twitter account to thank the community for their support

'I didn't feel anything at the time: 
the adrenaline took over and my focus was purely on stopping this man 
causing any more damage.

'Thankfully my injuries weren't as bad as they could have been and I hope to be back on the streets within a few weeks.'

He also praised worshippers at the mosque who helped pin the attacker down during the incident.

Pc Koch, who has been an officer for 
six years, said: 'I owe those people a massive debt of thanks and if it 
wasn't for their help, bravely running towards a man they'd already seen
brandishing a large knife, I may not be here today.

'As soon as I'm back on my feet I 
intend to visit the mosque and ask the imam to pass on my gratitude to 
the worshippers who put their own safety in jeopardy to assist me.

'In the end it was a great community effort to overpower the man and arrest him.'

It is thought the man, who was not a 
regular at the mosque in Birmingham, became upset because the prayers 
were not being performed in the manner of his denomination.

Earlier he thanked surgeons for 'putting me back together'.

Today the heroic policeman used a West Midlands Police Twitter account to thank the community for their support.

Using @BhamResponseC, he said: 'Borrowing the team account to say a big "Thank You" to all for your tweets of support.

'It means a lot to know the community has our backs.

'I
also want to thank @OFFICIALWMAS for sorting me out at the scene. The 
gents in the mosque for risking their safety to help me #oneteam.

'I’m
currently recovering from my surgery but hope to be back on my feet 
ASAP. Thanks again to everyone that helped put me back together x'.

One witness, who asked not to be named, said the scene at the mosque was like a 'blood bath'.

He said: ‘I heard shouting behind me as I was praying. I turned 
around and saw two men grappling with each other.

‘Suddenly a man pulled out a knife and
stabbed the other man in the leg, near the groin.

'Someone tried to 
intervene but the man just went for him and thrust a knife into his 
abdomen. It was absolutely terrifying.’

The suspect, a 32-year-old Somalian man, was taken to a secure mental health facility today

Hand wound: Dr Arshad Mahmood had his hand stabbed by the knifeman in the Birmingham mosque

Minutes later two police officers, one
male and one female, arrived at the Madrasah Qasim-ul-Uloom mosque in 
Ward End and the man allegedly ran at them with a large combat knife.

It is then that the officer intervened, but was stabbed in his torso.

‘The police tried to Taser 
the man but he didn’t fall down,’ the witness continued. ‘Instead he 
just lunged at the officer after pulling out his knife again and stabbed
him. There was blood everywhere.’

As Pc Koch recovers, two of the other men were 
being treated for multiple stab wounds following the attack just after 
11pm on Saturday.

An off-duty surgeon who happened to be at prayers fought to keep them alive before paramedics arrived.

The knifeman stopped to wash blood from his hands before praying, according to witnesses.

Mohammed Yasser, 31, a software programmer said: 'My dad went to read at the mosque but was stopped by the police. He said there had been an attack at the mosque.

'A worshipper had come in and he attacked one person and then attacked two others.

'The others tried to subdue him and then he went to wash his hands and then started praying again.

'Then two police officers came and went in and Tasered him.'

The mosque is a converted house. Violence broke out shortly before 11pm on Saturday following late night prayers

Another man, Dr Arshad Mahmood, who 
had his hand stabbed while trying to disarm the attacker, said: 
‘Everyone was frightened. It was so sudden.

‘A man started stabbing one of the 
guys who was just sitting right next to him.

'We went to save him. He had
multiple injuries, three or four wounds.

'A few of us went to stop him. 
One of the guys was strong enough to stop him. I held his hand. One also
had an injury on his thigh.’

Another witness said: ‘He shouted 
“Allah is going to punish you all”. He stabbed two people then one guy 
restrained him and someone called the police.’

The suspect was being 
held yesterday in a mental health facility on suspicion of attempted 
murder.

The attack comes less than a month 
after soldier Lee Rigby was murdered in Woolwich, south London, 
allegedly by knifemen boasting they were avenging the death of Muslims 
by the military.

The male officer, who has not yet been
named, was due to receive a bravery award this week for helping to save
the life of a young child in a separate incident last year.

Chief Superintendent Alex Murray, of 
West Midlands Police, praised the policeman and said that there wuld be an investigation into why the Taser appeared to have no effect on the attacker.

He said: 'A man inside the mosque reported to police just after 11pm that someone inside was stabbing people.

'Our officers managed to arrive just four minutes later.

Many people living locally stood out on the street to watch what was happening as police maintained a presence in the area

An eyewitness said the stabbing happened after a row at the Madrasah Qasim ul Uloom mosque

'A male and female officer saw people injured and were directed to a side room where there was an individual with a knife.

'They challenged the individual, who then ran at them with a knife.

'A Taser used by the male officer had no effect on the man whatsoever.

'The attacker then stab the officer in the chest and stomach around his protective vest.

'Despite that the officer still managed to wrestle the attacker and disarm him.

'People in the mosque were brilliant, they managed to give first aid to our officer, as well as the other three people who were hurt.

'An off-duty surgeon was also there and provided invaluable help.

'There was some really brave action from police and the public in the mosque that night.'

He added: ‘There’s no connection with 
any other incidents that we can see at the moment – for example, 
Woolwich or other incidents around the country.

'There’s no information 
at this stage to suggest it was a hate crime.’

Liam Byrne, MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill, said: ‘This was not a hate crime, this was a tragic, sad, and isolated incident.’

Mohammed Shafiq, of national Muslim 
organisation the Ramadhan Foundation, said: ‘We must be clear there 
should be no place for this sort of violence in our country.’
