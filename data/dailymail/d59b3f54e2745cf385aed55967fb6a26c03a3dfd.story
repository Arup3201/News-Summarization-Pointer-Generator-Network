It is known as one of the most beautiful cities in the world, but it seems St Petersburg is also keen to capitalise on its nightlife.

Step in the BarBus Maxi, a converted Ikarus 280 bus that is designed to take groups out for a nocturnal tour of the city, while staging an epic party on board.

The former public transport vehicle has everything that could be expected of a raging nightclub, including dance floor, fully stocked bar, TV screens and even a pole in the centre of the floor.

While many party buses are colourful transport or alcohol-free, the BarBus is the party destination

While a party bus is hardly a new concept, many places forbid drinking on them while others are simply trumped up transport from one club to another. 

But the BarBus is the destination, says Alexander Berest, the entrepreneur  who used his engineering skills to create the ultimate in fun on four wheels after being inspired by a night out on a normal bus. 

'We were in a great mood and one of my friends had a guitar which he was playing,' Berest said.

'The driver was too young to mind us making loud music and the other passengers got involved and we were all singing and dancing.

'As the bus drove through the student's area more passengers got on and joined the party, and the idea for the Barbus Maxi was born from there.'

BarBus also boasts leather sofas, a smoke machine, air-conditioning and a mirrored ceiling.

A night on the BarBus costs £80 in the week and £110 on the weekend for four hours.  

Alexander said: 'It took a year and a half to create but the result was worth it as now BarBus is legendary in St Petersburg.'

Next he plans to extend his fleet of party buses, with a retro bus themed around the Swinging Sixties on the agenda.
