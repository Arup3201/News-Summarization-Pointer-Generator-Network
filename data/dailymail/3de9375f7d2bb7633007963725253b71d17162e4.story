Jailed: Dean Coleman persuaded Hannah Rogers to get into his car to kiss and make up after a row but when she ran away from his car he reversed into her

A promising young jockey was jailed yesterday for driving his BMW car into his girlfriend after a row.

Dean Coleman, 24, persuaded Hannah Rogers to get into his car to kiss and make up and drove the 22-year-old to a beauty spot near Ogmore, South Wales.

The pair argued again before she ran away from his car.

A court heard Coleman - who has ridden 25 winners at courses across Britain - reversed into her.

Prosecutor Eugene Egan said: 'He hit her in the back knocking her down - then apologised and threatened he would take an overdose.

'He drove Hannah to hospital where she spent two weeks with a displacement to her spine.

'Coleman visited her and sent her texts asking her not to tell the police what had happened.'

Cardiff Crown Court heard Coleman was on bail for intimidation and suspected arson against a fellow jockey when he injured Miss Rogers.

Coleman also deliberately drove into the back of Miss Rogers' car at traffic lights after an earlier argument.

He admitted causing actual bodily harm, attempting to pervert the course of justice, threats to cause damage, intimidation, and two charges of dangerous driving.

Coleman, of near Bridgend, was jailed for two years.

David Elias, defending, said: 'He once had a bright future, was hard working and earned good money and hopefully on his release can get back there.

'He was abusing alcohol and drugs at the time and was totally out of control with his lifestyle.'

Coleman, who has cancelled his jockeyâ€™s licence after 248 races, read a letter to the court which he had written while on remand.

He said: 'I would never intentionally hurt Hannah.

'I have had time to look back at every mistake I have made in life and make plans for my future.

'I got myself in with the wrong crowd and was surrounded by alcohol and drugs like cocaine and valium and I will never go down that road again.

'I will prove to my friends and family that I have a bright future ahead of me and I will not let them down.'
