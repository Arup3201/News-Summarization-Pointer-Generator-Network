Posing proudly with the  vehicles they stole, these two criminals must rank among the stupidest in Britain.

Jonathan Dougan, 26, and Matthew Murphy, 23, took motorbikes, high-performance cars and bottles of champagne from their victims’ homes  in a seven-month campaign.

But the dim-witted pair – who were both on parole from prison – came unstuck when they posted dozens of incriminating images on Facebook.

A pair of thieves were caught by police after posting pictures on Facebook of them posing with luxury stolen cars and bikes on Facebook.  Matthew Murphy, seen posing with a car on his Facebook page

Police were able to use evidence on the social-networking site to track them down and convict them

Almost 50 shots were uploaded on to the social media site, as the two career criminals bragged of their loot.

Acting on a tip-off from one of the victims, police officers were simply able to download all the evidence they needed.

Last
 night the two men, both from Salford, were behind bars after they were 
each sentenced to nine years and four months in prison.

A
 police source said: ‘This pair may be a few sandwiches short of a 
picnic but they will have plenty of time to reflect on their stupidity.

Victims included a Broughton couple who were both being treated for cancer

The pair - both on parole from jail - came unstuck after they bragged about their life of crime on the social media network by posting a string of pictures of them larking about with the stolen gear

The pair appear to be obsessed with bikes and their Facebook pages show them posing with several different motorcyles

‘For
 months they carried out systematic raids on people’s homes and made off
 with a huge haul of expensive motorbikes and cars.  Thankfully they 
were the architects of their own downfall and we hope that when they are
 finally released from prison they realise a life of crime is not their 
strong suit.’

The thieves 
had both been jailed in 2008 for nine years after using baseball bats 
and knives to carry out a series of armed robberies. But they were freed
 on licence in 2012, after serving half their jail sentence, and 
returned to crime.

In their 
latest stealing spree in the Manchester area between November 2012 and 
June 2013 they carried out at least 15 raids. Among their haul were a 
number of high-value vehicles including a £30,000 Mercedes E820.

But
 in June last year the owner of a KTM motorbike they stole was tipped 
off that Dougan was  responsible and logged on to find a  Facebook photo
 of the thief  straddling it.

Police
 then discovered a treasure trove of evidence as well as online entries 
with Murphy bragging about how he worked ‘for meself’ and photos of 
Dougan posing with a £50 note stuck to his head.

Dougan and Murphy pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court to conspiring to steal.

Photos on Facebook show the pair posing with alcohol and fifty pound notes as part of their boastful lifestyle

Sentencing Dougan and Murphy judge David Hernandez said they were 'glamourising' their offending and had enjoyed committing their crimes
