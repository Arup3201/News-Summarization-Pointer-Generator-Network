It's the stuff that dreams are made of for young boys - being asked for tips by a famous goalkeeper in the middle of an international televised football match.

But this was a reality for Stephan White who could not quite believe it when China's goalie Wang Dalei looked through the netted goals and asked the 12-year-old which way he should dive in an attempt to save a penalty against Saudi Arabia at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane on Saturday night.

The stunned ball boy suggested that Dalie go to the left which saved a crucial goal in the match that China won 1-0 and taking the team a significant step closer to the quarter finals in the Asia Cup.

When the advice paid off, Stephan received a grateful hug from Dalie, who was celebrating his birthday that night, and was invited to the team's training session on Monday.

Now perceived as a good luck charm, the boy from Brisbane has become an overnight sensation in China.

As if the experience could not have been anymore surreal, the young budding goalie was swamped by the Chinese media at the session.

The Brisbane Roar fan declared China was now his second favourite team

Stephan, who could be seen in the video looking behind in disbelief at another ball boy once his advice proved sound, said he was shocked when he was approached by the goalie.  

'I told him left because that‘s the way I always go in trying to predict where the ball will go,' he told Fox Sports.

'I was really excited when he saved it.'

Declaring China was now his second favourite team, the Brisbane Roar fan admitted his love of goalkeeping which runs in the family with brothers Samuel, David and Dominic also gloveman.
