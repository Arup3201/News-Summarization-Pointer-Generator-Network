Ten-man Sevilla held on to win 1-0 at Rayo Vallecano in La Liga.

An early strike from Carlos Bacca was enough for Champions League chasing Sevilla, who had midfielder Daniel Carrico sent off for a second bookable offence three minutes from time.

It was hardly a surprise that the visitors ended the game a man light after picking up six bookings during the 90 minutes.

Ten-man Sevilla held on to win 1-0 at Rayo Vallecano in the Primera Division 

Bacca scored in the eighth minute before Sevilla were reduced to 10 men for the dying moments on Sunday

The game in Vallecas marked 90 years since Rayo were formed, and the club also announced that five euros of every ticket sold will go towards paying the rent of 85-year-old Carmen Martinez, the woman Rayo pledged to help financially after she was evicted from her house.

Sevilla started strongly, scoring the game's only goal after eight minutes.

Grzegorz Krychowiak's pass from the right found Bacca, who finished into the bottom left-hand corner from close range.

Rayo struggled to get going, with both sides more preoccupied with fouling than playing football.

In fact, it took until the 41st minute for the next meaningful effort of the game to take place with Joaquin's 20-yard effort sailing over the bar.

Two minutes later Cristian Alvarez caught Stephane Mbia's 25-yard effort as Sevilla went into the break ahead.

Rayo were clearly given a stern talking to by boss Paco Jemez at the break as immediately after the restart they created a decent opportunity, only for Leo Baptistao to miss the target from 12 yards out.

Carrico then Jose Diogo Figueiras both had unsuccessful efforts on goal as Vallecano failed to create opportunities.

With time ticking away, Manucho missed a golden chance to draw his team level, heading over from six yards out.

Even the dismissal of Carrico - shown a second yellow for a foul on Alex Moreno - kicked the home side into life as Sevilla collected the points.
