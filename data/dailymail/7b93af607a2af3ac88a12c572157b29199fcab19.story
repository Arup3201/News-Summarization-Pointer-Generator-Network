She has played on the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings soundtracks and performed with stars such as Madonna, Mick Jagger and Sting.

But classical musician Kathryn Bassano struggled to keep in time with loan repayments on her £400,000 antique viola – and is now facing a legal battle to keep it.

The 57-year-old, married to renowned conductor Peter Bassano, 68, is fighting in the High Court to prevent her beloved 211-year-old instrument being sold by her creditors.

Court fight: Kathryn Bassano, 57, from Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire is battling in High Court to keep her 211-year-old instrument

The loans were taken out after the couple were hit with a £185,000 legal bill for a separate case in 2007.

They lost a row over an unpaid builder’s bill of £16,000 on their £3million seven-bedroom home in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire.

Mrs Bassano used the viola as ‘security’, it is claimed, to raise a series of cash loans totalling £280,000.

Instrument dealers Alfred Toft and Peter Biddulph along with pawnbroking company Borro Loan Ltd, who provided the loans between them, claim the necessary repayments have not been made.

They are asking the High Court to order that the viola be sold and the proceeds split between them to cover the debts which, with interest, are now said to exceed £500,000.

The Bassanos claim that technicalities to do with the loan agreements mean they cannot be enforced by forfeiting the viola, which was made by feted Italian craftsman Giovanni Battista Ceruti in 1803 – and which they are desperate to save.

Prized: A viola like Mrs Bassano's

Yesterday the court heard that Mrs Bassano first approached Mr Toft, a dealer in fine stringed instruments who lives in Penshurst, Kent, after a service at his local church.

Mr Toft’s barrister Anthony Allston, said the dealer agreed to lend Mrs Bassano £100,000 in February 2010. Mr Allston added that both Mr Toft and Mrs Bassano had signed a document detailing the ‘loan agreement and security by way of a mortgage over the viola’.

The terms of the loan were £100,000, to be borrowed for 12 months, at a monthly interest rate of 2.5 per cent, the barrister said.

Ten monthly interest payments of £2,500 were made ‘then nothing else … none of the capital has ever been repaid’ the court heard.

Mrs Bassano also borrowed £50,000 from Mr Biddulph.

Mr Bassano, a former member of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and previously professor at the Royal College of Music, argued that the loans made to his wife by the two instrument dealers did not comply with rules laid down in the 1974 Consumer Credit Act to control money-lending.

Therefore, he claimed, the loans could not be enforced by forfeiting the viola.

He and his wife are also contesting the validity of Borro Loan’s security over the instrument – for a £130,000 loan.

The Bassanos argued that the viola is worth more than the £230,000 which would be raised should the judge order it to be sold.

Mr Allston told the judge: ‘Mrs Bassano seeks declarations to the effect that the loan transactions between herself and Mr Toft and Mr Biddulph are unenforceable.

‘It is claimed by Mrs Bassano that Mr Toft cannot enforce the agreement because he needed a credit licence. Her husband makes it clear that she [also] intends to contest the validity of Borro’s security,’ the barrister added.

‘There can be no doubt that Mr Toft lent £100,000 to Mrs Bassano, none of which she has repaid.’

Mr Toft denied that he needed such a licence to recover his money, and told the judge: ‘I am not a money-lender.’ He added that the loan was ‘very much a one-off transaction’.

Mrs Bassano did not attend court yesterday. Her husband is part of a 500-year-old musical dynasty, with a family tree linking him to six talented Italian brothers brought to England by Henry VIII to entertain the Royal Court.

Outside the hearing Mr Toft said of the contested instrument, which is currently being held by an auctioneer: ‘It’s a nice viola – it’s a rarity.

‘Whoever buys it will probably sell it for about £400,000.’

The hearing continues.
