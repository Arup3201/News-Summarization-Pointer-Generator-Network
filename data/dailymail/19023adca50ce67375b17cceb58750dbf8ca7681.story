A shocking video has emerged of a young man callously kicking a cat through the air, while he and his friend filming the incident laughed.

More than 5,000 people have signed a petition urging police in Akron, Ohio, to find and prosecute the man.

Thankfully for the cat, it reverted to type and landed on its feet.

Police are investigating after local broadcaster NewsNet5 contacted officers, who received a petition calling on them to arrest the cat-kicker for animal cruelty.

The petition says: 'He didn't show any sort of regret, as he and his buddies were having a big laugh about what just happened. You can also imagine that the cat didn't enjoy this!'

Torturing a pet in Ohio carries up to 90 days in jail and a fine of up to $2,500, to be paid to animal protection groups.
