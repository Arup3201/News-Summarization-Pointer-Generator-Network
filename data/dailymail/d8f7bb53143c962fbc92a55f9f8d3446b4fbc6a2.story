A mother has been charged with murder after the body of her eight-year-old daughter was discovered in the trunk of her car.

Teagan Batstone was found dead after police were called to a vehicle that had rolled into a ditch in Surrey, British Columbia, on Wednesday.

Lisa Batstone was arrested a day later and appeared in court on Thursday facing second-degree murder charges in the death of her only child. Her lawyer was not present and she asked to be seen by a psychiatrist.

The 41-year-old posted a photo of the pair on Facebook during a day out zip-lining just four days before Teagan's death.

Her father, Gabe Batstone, from Ottawa, had just returned home from spending the weekend with the youngster and told CBC News he is devastated by the loss of his 'beautiful daughter'.

He wrote on Twitter today: 'Life will never be the same after losing my daughter to murder… We are devastated by the loss of our beautiful Teagan. Beloved daughter, sister who deserved so much more.'

He later tweeted: 'Thanks for the condolences. I am unable to talk without sobbing but tomorrow I hope to share great memories of my love Teagan Erin Batstone.' 

Mr Batstone divorced the suspect six years ago and splits his time between Ottawa and Vancouver. He has two other sons and has brought in grief counsellors to advise him on how to break the horrifying news. 

The youngster would fly to her father's home in Ottawa four times a year, where she would spend time with her two-year-old half-brother and her eight-year-old stepbrother.

On Wednesday afternoon, police were called to what they believed was a 'minor motor vehicle' accident, but saw the car was in a ditch in a rural area. They then arrested Batstone at the scene.  

It was then that they found Teagan's body in the trunk. The cause of her death has not yet been confirmed.

Maria Hachullu, Batstone's neighbor, told CBC she was 'super friendly' and that Teagan had many friends who were always out playing together.

'We talked over our balconies,' Hachullu said. 'She was a very normal, kind lady.'

Batstone will appear in court for another hearing on December 18.
