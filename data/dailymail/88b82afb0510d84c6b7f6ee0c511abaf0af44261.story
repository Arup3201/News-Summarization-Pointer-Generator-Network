These fascinating images show labourers harvesting forced rhubarb in vast, candlelit sheds at a farm that helped catapult the versatile plant back into popularity.

Seasonal labourers at Oldroyd's Ashfield Home Farm in West Yorkshire's famous Rhubarb Triangle are busy carefully pulling up the early salmon-pink sticks, which are nurtured indoors from around November.

The rhubarb is traditionally harvested by candlelight because strong light will stop the growth.

The roots are only taken out of the soil and into the forcing shed after they have received the necessary amount of frost, specific to each variety.

In the warmth and complete darkness, the plant has to use its own energy reserves, because it has no access to food or light. The stored carbohydrate in the roots is transformed into glucose, giving the forced rhubarb its distinctive, bittersweet flavour.

The forced variety is more tender than that grown outdoors in the summer.

Rhubarb is a native of Siberia and thrives in the wet cold winters in Yorkshire. West Yorkshire once produced 90 per cent of the world's winter forced rhubarb from the forcing sheds that were common across the fields there.

The early winter frost converts the root energy store into a form accessible to the plant for growth when it is taken into the sheds.

The 9-square-mile Rhubarb Triangle in West Yorkshire is famous for producing early forced rhubarb.

In 1875, it became the first place in the world to build special sheds for growing rhubarb out of season. The Yorkshire coalfields provided a cheap local source of fuel to heat the sheds.

As rhubarb’s popularity increased, so did the producers in this area, numbering well over 200 at rhubarb’s height in popularity.

The quality of the Yorkshire crop became renowned, and demand for it became so huge that producers in other areas of Britain could not compete, and eventually stopped altogether.

Stemming the tide: Rhubarb fell out of popularity in wartime, when families on sugar rations found it too bitter

The producers were centralised in a frost pocket in the shadow of the Pennines between Leeds, Wakefield and Bradford, which became known as The Rhubarb Triangle.

Geographically centrally positioned in Great Britain, coincidentally where railroads crossed, gave the producers a transport system to any corner of the country, so that the harvest could be in the market the next morning.

Special 'Rhubarb Express' trains left the area nightly, mostly bound for the old Covent Garden market, and from there large amounts were sold on into Europe.

But wartime Britain’s palate was rather on the sweet side thanks to rationing, and they simply could not get the sugar that they required to bring this sharp flavoured vegetable to their taste.

After the war, as overseas trade began and quick easy refrigerated logistics made a wide range of new tropical fruits readily available, rhubarb was left on the shelf.

Now, however, the humble plant is experiencing something of a revival, with celebrity chefs including Rick Stein, Nigella Lawson, Anthony Worrall Thompson and Jamie Oliver singing the praises of Yorkshire Forced Rhubarb.

The Ashfield farm has received many awards for its vital role in bringing rhubarb back to the masses.

Janet Oldroyd Hulme has become affectionately known by the media as the ‘High Priestess of Rhubarb’.

The earliest recorded use of rhubarb is 2700BC, although its use is thought to date back much further. It was very important drug used for a variety of ailments particularly gut, lung and liver problems.

Marco Polo is attributed with bringing the drug to Europe in the 13th Century, when it was referred to as the Rhacoma root.

The drug was so sought-after that in 1657 in England, it could command three times the price of Opium.

By the 16th Century, seeds had been introduced in Britain, but the wrong strain was imported and its use went into decline because the British version did not work.

Rhubarb was first used in English cooking in the late 18th Century, probably in an attempt to get the benefits of the drug into the body, only gaining in favour with the British when the forcing process was accidentally discovered in Chelsea Physic Gardens in 1817.
