With two weddings and the birth of her second grandchild imminent, the past few months have proved busy ones for Princess Caroline of Hanover.

But the round of parties and preparation didn't stop the 56-year-old Monégasque royal from taking time out to watch her youngest child, 14-year-old Princess Alexandra of Hanover take to the ice during Verona's annual Opera on Ice extravaganza.

The proud mother looked enthralled as she watched her daughter perform difficult pirouettes and triple axels alongside skating partner Carolina Kostner at the event, which combines opera singing with ice skating.

Caroline, who was relaxed in a tailored leather jacket, a grey silk shirt and a casual pair of black jeans, joined by her youngest son Pierre, 26, and his blonde girlfriend, the Italian aristocrat and journalist Beatrice Borromeo, 28.

Beatrice, who writes for the Daily Beast and Newsweek, appeared to have been taking style tips from her boyfriend's mother, and wore a similar leather jacket but swapped jeans for black leggings teamed with ballet pumps.

Alexandra, who waved shyly to her mother while enjoying the round of applause that followed the performance, is the only child born from Princess Caroline's third marriage to Ernst August, Prince of Hanover.

The teenager, who is in the line of succession for both the Monégasque and British thrones, has two older half-brothers from her father's first marriage as well as the Casiraghi clan.

She's not the only Monégasque royal to show a talent for sport either. Older sister Charlotte had a successful showjumping career, while her aunt Princess Charlene was an Olympic swimmer prior to her marriage.

The Monaco royals are currently enjoying a 
break between royal weddings, the first of which was the nuptials of 
Caroline's oldest son Andrea in Monaco at the end of last month.

The
29-year-old heir to current ruler Prince Albert married Colombian 
heiress Tatiana Santo Domingo, also 29 and the mother of his baby son 
Sacha.

Wedding number two is to take place later in the autumn and will see Charlotte Casiraghi, 27, marry Moroccan-French actor, Gad Emaleh, 42, with whom she is expecting a baby at the end of the year.

Opera on Ice has become an important part of the Veronese social calendar since launching in 1995 and is part of a series of shows which tour Europe, stopping at Stockholm, Lausanne and Zurich as well as the Italian city.

Along with some of the world's top figure skaters, performers who have lent their voices to the show include Chris de Burgh, Leona Lewis and Ronan Keating.

Intent: Princess Caroline and Beatrice concentrated on the show but Pierre appeared less enamoured
