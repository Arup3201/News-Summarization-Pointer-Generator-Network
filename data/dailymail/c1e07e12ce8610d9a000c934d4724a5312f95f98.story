Military chiefs failed to calculate the potential dangers and the size of the forces needed for the war in Afghanistan, General Sir Peter Wall admitted yesterday,

The former Chief of the General Staff made the damning statement in a BBC documentary ahead of the upcoming withdrawal of Western troops from the country after 13 years of war.

Another senior military commander said the UK was ‘under-prepared, under-resourced’ and had no clear strategy to succeed in the conflict.

In a scathing critique of the UK’s involvement in Afghanistan, a series of British military commanders admitted a failure to appreciate the size of the task and that mistakes were made in the build-up to the fight. At times, troops were so stretched there was a risk they would be ‘massacred’, it was claimed.

Sir Peter, who retired this year, said: ‘We had put forward a plan… saying that… for the limited objectives that we had set ourselves, this was a reasonable force. And I freely admit now, that calculus was wrong.’

The two programmes analyse the muddled decision-making process that led the British government to send 3,300 troops to the country as part of the Nato force in 2006.

The documentary revealed that the British military was fully aware it could not wage more than one campaign for any length of time.

But, despite being already heavily engaged in Iraq, the UK pressed ahead with a decision to step up its commitment in Afghanistan.

In a two-part programme entitled The Lion’s Last Roar?, Brigadier Ed Butler, Commander of the British Forces in Helmand in 2006, said: ‘We were under-prepared, we were under-resourced, and most importantly, we didn’t have a clear and achievable strategy to deliver success.’

His comments reveal a marked difference from his view in 2006 – as the UK stepped up their campaign against the Taliban – when he said that British forces were ‘well-prepared and well-equipped’ to deal with the insurgency.

General Lord Dannatt, former Chief of the General Staff, added: ‘We knew that we were heading for two considerable size operations and we really only had the organisation and manpower for one.

Therefore perhaps we should have revisited the decision…We didn’t do that.’

In the summer of 2006, some British forces in Afghanistan found themselves effectively stranded in a number of outposts in the north of Helmand province. ‘There was a real danger… that we would find a platoon cut off and potentially massacred,’ said Lord Dannatt.

In 2012, David Cameron announced Britain would withdraw combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. General Lord Richards, former Chief of the Defence Staff, said he had fought against the decision to announce this. He said: ‘I felt a deadline of that nature was too trusting in our ability to deliver the outcome required.’

The conflict has raised doubts over whether Britain will take part in similar military operations.

Bruce Riedel, an adviser to President Obama in 2009, said: ‘The US has a better appreciation after the war in Afghanistan of the limits on British power. It will be interesting to see if Afghanistan marks the end of Britain as a global military power.’
