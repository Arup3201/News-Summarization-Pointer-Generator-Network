Team news

Crystal Palace

Crystal Palace's club-record signing James McArthur is set to make his debut when the Eagles host Burnley in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday.

Kevin Doyle and Zeki Fryers are also in line to make their first starts for the Eagles but Andrew Johnson is still gaining fitness and is unlikely to feature.

Marouane Chamakh is ruled out with a hamstring injury but Joe Ledley is available again after coming on as a substitute for Wales' win over Andorra on Tuesday.

Provisional squad: Speroni, Hennessey, Mariappa, Kelly, Fryers, Ward, Delaney, Dann, Hangeland, Jedinak, O'Keefe, McArthur, Bannan, Ledley, Williams, Bolasie, Thomas, Puncheon, Gayle, Campbell, Johnson, Doyle, Zaha.

Burnley

Burnley's three deadline day signings all come into contention at Crystal Palace, although Sean Dyche has hinted Nathaniel Chalobah and Michael Keane are unlikely to be thrust straight in.

The loan duo only trained with the Clarets for the first time on Thursday after being away with the England Under 21s, whereas forward George Boyd has been working with Dyche's group during the international break.

Danny Ings, who joined Chalobah and Keane in Gareth Southgate's squad, is considered fine following a bout of illness so fellow striker Sam Vokes (knee) is expected to be the only absentee at Selhurst Park.

Provisional squad: Heaton, Trippier, Lafferty, Ward, Duff, Shackell, Mee, Wallace, Marney, Ings, Kightly, Cisak, Jones, Taylor, Sordell, Reid, Jutkiewicz, Chalobah, Boyd, Gilks, Keane, Long, Barnes, Arfield.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

The Eagles are unbeaten in nine home league meetings with Burnley (W4 D5, six clean sheets), a run that goes back to December 2001.

Burnley have won all four previous top-flight meetings with the Eagles, but the sides have not met in the top tier since 1970/71.

Wilfried Zaha has scored twice and been sent off once in his last three competitive appearances against Burnley.

Burnley have a poor record at Crystal Palace and lost their most recent game at Selhurst Park 4-3, with Wilfried Zaha (right) netting twice for the London side. Here, during the game, he fends off Kieran Trippier

Crystal Palace have never won a Premier League home game in September (D3 L5).

Dwight Gayle has scored eight goals in his last six games in all competitions, including four in his last two.

Burnley have used at least nine English players in all three league games this season.

The Clarets have never kept a clean sheet in a Premier League away game.

Indeed, the Lancashire side have lost 18 of their 20 Premier League matches on the road, winning just once (4-1 v Hull City).

Crystal Palace have conceded at least twice in their last six league games.

Crystal Palace have lost more points from winning positions than any other side this season (5).
