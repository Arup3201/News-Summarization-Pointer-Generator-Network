White people will be a minority in the U.S. by 2044 while the rest of the population will be a mixture of different ethnicities, according to a new survey.

The next 30 years will see an ageing white population reduced from 75 per cent of U.S. citizens today to 49.7 per cent in 2044, the first year minorities will outnumber whites.

In the same time period the Hispanic population will soar from 16 per cent today to 25 per cent, while the Asian population will nearly double from 4 per cent to 7.9 per cent.

The year 2044 will mark the first time that ethnic minorities will outnumber white Americans, with the Hispanic population growing from 17 per cent now to 25 per cent, while the Asian population will nearly double

While whites will still be the single largest ethnic group in America by 2044, when all the minorities are added together, it will form a 'majority minority' population.

That trend will continue into 2060 when white people will make up around 44 per cent of Americans, according to research by Brookings Institution.

As younger generations opt for having fewer children, and delay parenthood into later life, deaths will begin to outnumber births in the white population by 2025, when numbers will start to decline.

By 2060 white people will still make up the majority of the senior population, with 55 per cent of over 65s being white, but among the young that drops to 48 per cent, with 64 per cent being minorities.

By 2060 white Americans will make up the majority of seniors, but among the young that drops to 48 per cent, with 64 per cent coming from minorities

During the next 50 years the number of Hispanic and Asian people will more than double, while the mixed race population will expand by more than three times, despite still making up the smallest single group.

According to William Frey,  a researcher for Brookings, the new projections show a greater than expected increase in the Asian population, thanks in part to higher immigration, while the gain is slightly lower than expected for Hispanics, as the birth rate begins to decline.

The black population will see only a modest increase between now and 2044, rising from 12.3 per cent according to the 2010 census, to 12.7 per cent according to this research.

Guy Garcia, a spokesman for researchers Ethnifacts, told the Latin Post: 'Thirty percent all grandparents in America have a grandchild of a different race or ethnicity, and the diversity in this country is growing in so many ways, we are just starting to get a grasp on those changes.

'Gay parents, when they adopt, there is a high rate of multicultural adoptions. We have all these new variation and permutations of the American family. 

'It’s going to continue to happen, and the highest growth is coming from people of color, but they are mixing and merging and having children with people of every race, and it is going to continue to be that way.'
