We know all about Superman, Spider-Man and Batman - but now Essex has a 'superhero' of its own - and his power is challenging stereotypes.

'The Gimp Man of Essex' walks around towns dressed in a full rubber bondage suit - used in sexual activities such as bondage, discipline, domination, submission, sadism and masochism (BDSM).

He wants to start a public debate about sexual stereotypes, and is raising money for charity as he goes.

Changing attitudes: Gimp Man wants to help people to think more openly about sex and fetishes

Every time someone stops to take a picture of him and posts it to his Facebook page - which has more than 2,500 likes - he donates £1 to mental health charity Colchester Mind.

He has raised more than £800 so far - with one anonymous person donating £500 to his JustGiving page yesterday, along with the message: 'Love this - what an inspiration. Congratulations, and keep up the good work!'

Much like his superhero counterparts, 'Gimp Man' likes to keep his identity a secret - not even his wife and children know about his fetish-friendly exploits.

He does not go out at weekends or during school holidays, and says most of the reaction he gets from people on the streets is positive and friendly - though he does occasionally get branded 'a paedophile or pervert'.

'Most people are very welcoming when I tell them what it's all about,' he told the BBC. 'I don't go round to scare the life out of people.

'People call me a legend, but I only donate a few hundred quid and walk round looking a fool.'

Gimp Man says he is 'adult enough' to realise that people will see the negatives in everything, but it is these people's perceptions he is hoping to change.

'People are a lot more open minded nowadays. And at the end of the day, you can walk along the beach and see a lot more than I'm exposing!' he said.

Gimp Man's jaunts around the streets of Colchester, Clacton and other Essex towns were not initially a charity venture - it was only when someone suggested to him that he could raise some money that he decided on the idea of helping Colchester Mind.

The charity's chief executive, James McQuiggan, says they are very grateful for all of his support and donations.
