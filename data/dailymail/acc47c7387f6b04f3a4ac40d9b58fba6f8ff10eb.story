A second toll motorway is planned as part of a road building drive to power Britain’s faltering economic recovery – but it will take 18 years to complete.

Ministers are planning to revive a decades-old plan to ease congestion on part of the M4 in South Wales, which is expected to be announced in June.

George Osborne has agreed to underwrite the £1billion project, Government sources claimed, which will be part of a major programme of upgrades to other major roads.

Transport officials are understood to be considering several other possible projects including an upgrade to the A1 North of Newcastle which would link London and Scotland by dual carriageway for the first time; the A303 in southwest England, and the A47 running through the Norfolk Broads.

The M4 scheme was first considered in 1989 and plans were unveiled almost ten years ago, but shelved five years later due to spiralling costs.

It is now expected to be the centrepiece of an infrastructure package, after the Chancellor announced an extra £3.3billion a year in funding for major projects to boost jobs and growth.

But it will take three years of 
preparation and 15 years to build and is not expected to open until the 
year 2031, highlighting the problems the government faces with getting 
major works underway.

David Cameron claimed the controversial High Speed 2 railway line – opposed by many of his backbenchers - was ‘vital’ if Britain was to compete in the ‘global race’.

But the first fast trains to Birmingham will not run until 2026 and the second phase to Manchester and Leeds will not be ready until the mid-2030s.

The anticipated announcement in this summer’s Comprehensive Spending Review follows a Government row about whether to embark on major and costly infrastructure investment to take advantage of low interest rates, to create jobs and improve the local economy.

The M4 project, 14-miles stretch of dual carriageway as a relief road between junctions 23 and 29, is intended to end notorious bottlenecks at the Brynglas Tunnels on the outskirts of Newport.

It has a budget of £830million over 15 years, and a toll will be operated by the Welsh Government to pay it back.

It is not without controversy as while ministers claim it will boost the South Wales economy as the roads are predicted to become more congested, campaigners warn it could backfire.

AA president Edmund King said introducing tolls could deter motorists, which he said had been a problem on the UK’s first tolled motorway, the 27-mile M6 toll near Birmingham.

He said: ‘We have seen with the M6 Toll that drivers can be turned off by the imposition of charges.

'There is already a toll to get into Wales on the Severn Crossing but no toll to get out. There is no doubt that the M4 around Newport needs improving. At the moment if there is a bad accident and the road is closed there is no real alternative for drivers.

‘But if the road is tolled it reduced its economic effectiveness as a lot of people will be put off using it and will simply avoid it.’

The A303 is controversial due to environmental objections as it would run through scenic countryside and it has been claimed it could disturb archaeological remains at Stonehenge.

But the A47 in Norfolk, an accident blackspot where dozens of motorists have died, would be welcomed.
