David Cameron today faced demands for an independent inquiry into 'cash 
for access' allegations after he confirmed he had wined and diners wealthy individuals - who had between 
them donated millions of pounds to the Conservative Party - at Downing Street and Chequers.

The Tories released a list of 12 donors who were invited with their 
wives and partners to four dinners in Downing Street since Mr Cameron's 
election in 2010. A second list of five donors invited for informal 
lunches at the PM's country residence Chequers was released later.

On the list were Lord John and Lady Sainsbury, secretive tycoon David Rowland - once branded a 'shady financier' - and billionaire City businessman Michael Spencer.

Today Mr Cameron - who sometimes cooks at the dinner parties - pledged to publish a quarterly register of any 
future meals at official residences with people who have given more than
£50,000 to the Tories.

Mr Cameron had come under intense pressure after former Tory 
co-treasurer Peter Cruddas was caught on film telling undercover 
reporters that 'premier league' gifts could secure meetings with 
ministers and influence policy.

He denied Mr Cruddas's claims that big donors' concerns were fed into
a policy committee at Downing Street, and insisted that none of those 
who dined with him had been recommended by the former treasurer - who 
quit his post on Saturday, hours after the Sunday Times revealed his 
comments.

'None of these dinners were fundraising dinners and none of these 
dinners were paid for by the taxpayer. I have known most of those 
attending for many years,' said the PM.

He announced that eminent lawyer and Tory peer Lord Gold would conduct a
party inquiry into the affair.

But Labour leader Ed Miliband dismissed the Gold inquiry as 'a 
whitewash' and called for an independent probe by the PM's official 
adviser on ministerial interests Sir Alex Allan.

Billionaire city boss Michael Spencer went for dinner at Number 10 in February

'This scandal speaks to the conduct and character of this Prime Minister and his Government,' said Mr Miliband.

'Anything short of an independent inquiry will leave a permanent stain 
on the reputation of this Government and this Prime Minister.'

The 12 dinner-party guests at Downing Street had between them given 
almost £18 million to the Conservatives since Mr Cameron became leader, 
he said.

And in a clear reference to last week's announcement of a cut from 50p 
to 45p in the top rate of income tax on earnings over £150,000, he 
added: 'I bet they did alright out of last week's Budget.'

Mr Miliband accused the PM of showing 'utter contempt' for the Commons 
by failing to attend the House to address MPs about the affair, instead 
sending Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude.

Mr Maude was almost drowned out by Labour shouts of 'Where's Cameron?' 
as he delivered a statement to MPs just hours after he had dismissed the
Cruddas allegations as 'a bit of a nonsense' in a radio interview.

He accused Labour of a 'shameful' role in the party funding saga, 
telling MPs that union barons who bankroll the party were able not only 
to influence policy but also to choose the leader.

Declaring that he will lead the Tory team in revived cross-party talks 
on party funding, Mr Maude said that Conservatives were ready to accept a
cap on donations, but only if it applied not only to individuals and 
companies but to unions too - something Labour has resisted.

The Conservative Party said that Mr Cameron hosted a post-election 
'thank-you' dinner at 10 Downing Street on July 14 2010 attended by a 
number of 'significant' donors who had given the Tories at least £50,000
each.

They included JCB chairman Sir Anthony Bamford, who has personally 
donated £70,000 since Mr Cameron became leader while his company has 
given almost £1.7 million; financier Michael Farmer, who has given 
around £2.5 million; hedge fund tycoon Michael Hintze, who gave more 
than £1.2 million; Tory peer Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, who 
gave £1 million; property developer Michael Freeman, who gave £380,000; 
and hedge fund chief executive Sir Paul Ruddock, who gave £520,000.

On February 28 last year, property tycoon and donor of more than £4 
million David Rowland attended a dinner in the flat, along with party 
co-chairman Lord Feldman.

On November 2 2011, Mr Cameron held a 'social dinner for strong and 
long-term supporters of the party, with whom the PM has a strong 
relationship', including Mr Farmer, the banker and Tory donor Henry 
Angest and oil company boss Ian Taylor.

And on February 27 this year, he held a social dinner with former 
treasurer and major donor Michael Spencer, who gave more than £3 million
through his company IPGL and £200,000 personally.

Mr Rowland and his wife had lunch at Chequers on August 8 2010, while 
businessman Fares Fares, who has donated almost £60,000 to the Tories, 
had lunch in the Buckinghamshire country house on November 7 that year.

Current or former Tory treasurers who have had lunch with Mr Cameron at 
Chequers included Mr Spencer on May 31 2010, Lord Ashcroft on June 6 
2010 and Howard Leigh on February 6 2011 - all of whom have donated 
significant sums to the party - while party co-chairman Lord Feldman has
visited the house on several occasions, said the Conservatives.

Lord Feldman is said to have visited Chequers on 'several occasions' as Conservative Party co-chairman.

Labour former Cabinet minister Jack 
Straw said that today's announcement was 'symptomatic of the pandemonium
that has broken out in the Conservative Party and in the higher reaches
of the Government.'

He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: 'I think that 
we will still need an independent inquiry.'

Deputy Prime Minister Nick 
Clegg also released a list of major Liberal Democrat donors who had lunch or 
dinners at his official residence Chevening today.

The party released four dates in April
and June last year where he entertained former Lib Dem party treasurer Richard Duncalf and his 
partner, entrepreneur Rumi Verjee, co-founder of Ministry of Sound James Palumbo and Sudhi and Anita Choudrie.

A party spokesman said: 'These were 
not paid for by the taxpayer. This list is based on party records and 
diaries and is complete to the best of our knowledge.'

The Prime Minister renewed calls for 
Labour to agree on a cap of £50,000 on donations to parties, but 
insisted that this limit must apply not only to individuals and 
companies but also to unions - something Labour has always resisted.

News Corporation chairman Rupert 
Murdoch, whose own meetings with politicians have come under intense 
scrutiny as a result of the News of the World hacking scandal, called 
for an independent inquiry into the 'cash for access' affair.

Writing on Twitter today, Mr Murdoch 
said: 'Of course there must be a full independent inquiry on both sides.

'In great detail, and with consequences. Trust must be established. 
Without trust, democracy, and order will go.'

Sir Christopher Kelly, chairman of the 
Committee on Standards in Public Life, last night warned that the 
revelations were ‘not an isolated incident’.

He
added: ‘As long as we have a system in which the main political parties
are reliant on very large donations from very rich individuals – or 
organisations, in the case of the Labour Party – then events of this 
kind are almost bound to happen.

‘It
is a cancer which needs to be addressed.’

The
revelations are deeply embarrassing for Mr Cameron, who pledged two 
years ago to crack down on the shadowy world of lobbying.

The
existence of secret dinners with donors also undermines the Coalition’s
much-vaunted transparency drive, which allows the public to see who 
ministers have met in their official capacity.

Downing Street insisted that the Government had been 'more transparent' than any previous administration.

Asked about the actions of Mr Cruddas, the spokeswoman said: 'We are just as flabbergasted as you guys.'

Appalled: Sir Christopher Kelly, Chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said the revelations were 'not an isolated incident' while Labour leader Ed Miliband called the news 'disturbing'
