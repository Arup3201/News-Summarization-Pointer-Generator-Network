The search for a British schoolboy who went missing in a storm in France resumed today amid rising fears for his safety.

Pierre Barnes, 12, has not been seen since he set off on a solo bicycle ride on the tiny holiday island of Porquerolles on Saturday afternoon.

He had just started a half-term holiday with his parents and brothers and sisters at the beauty spot, which is off France’s southern coast, close to Toulon.

But Pierre’s bicycle - which has its chain missing - and one of his shoes were later found on a coastal parth, close to raging seas, swollen up by 80mph winds and driving rain.

The holiday island of Porquerolles, on the south coast of France, measures less than five square miles

Rescuers using a helicopter, boats 
and sniffer dogs spent the weekend scouring the island for him, but had 
to call the search off at night because of the worsening weather.

Amid mounting fears for his safety, 
Pierre’s father, Stephen Barnes, a 57 year-old director of a property 
company, said: ‘I am certain he went off on an adventure on his bicycle 
but in the forest all the little tracks look the same.

‘He is lost but he is a strong boy 
and I hope he found a place to sleep where there was not too much wind. 
It’s difficult to say what you can do when you are cold and frightened.’

Mr Barnes, from Grantham, Lincs, and 
his wife of almost 20 years, Florence, 43, originally from Moisenay, a 
short distance to the south-east of Paris, maintained a vigil at a local
fire station.

They were joined by their other three
children, aged 17, 15 and 13 on the island, which covers four square 
miles and is inhabited by 200 people.

Today police suggested Pierre could have become disoriented as some of the worst storms in the past decade lashed the island.

Paul Mourier, the local prefect, said
there was ‘always hope’ Pierre might be found - pointing out the 
‘incredible resilience’ of children in his age group.

However, Mr Mourier said not a single person had come forward to report seeing Pierre since Saturday afternoon.

He said that temperatures dropped to minus 5C at night.

The schoolboy was wearing dark 
trousers and a green top, and would have been easily remembered as he 
cycled alone on such a small island.

Mr Mourier said counsellors were 
among those offering support to the Barnes family, and that both 
Pierre’s parents were taking part in the search.

The island’s tracks and paths are extremely narrow and in some places are dangerously close to cliffs.

More than 150 local volunteers had 
combed the island, in a huge ground, sea and air search operation amid 
atrocious conditions including poor visibility, 80mph gale-force winds 
and rough seas with up to 20-foot waves.

Even when the storms started to 
abate, efforts were hampered by rocky escarpments and thick undergrowth 
combined with fallen trees and debris.

Veronique Fleury, from Le Pelican 
water taxi which runs transfers to the island, said the whole island was
worried for the family.

She said: ‘Everyone is trying and 
trying to find him. We went all night long, all across the island hoping
to find him. It was very rough weather and at sea.

‘We hoped he just had a problem with the bicycle or got lost in the forest, but he’s still missing’.

Xavier Tarabeux, the Prosecutor at 
the port of Toulon, said the boy’s disappearance was solely being linked
to the extreme weather throughout the Mediterranean. 

He said the boy vanished during a storm ‘as bad as any which occurs only a couple of times every ten years’.
