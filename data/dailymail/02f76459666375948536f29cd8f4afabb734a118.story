A towering statue of kung fu legend Bruce Lee in action looms above the displays at a new exhibition marking 40 years since the star's death.

Bruce Lee: Kung Fu, Art, Life, which opened in Hong Kong today on the anniversary of Lee's death, features everything from the famous yellow tracksuit he wore in 'Game of Death' to poems he wrote as a young man, to the 3.5 metre high statue illustrating his physical skill to powerful effect.

Organised by the Bruce Lee Foundation together with the Hong Kong government, the showcase charts his journey from child actor and kung fu student to fully-fledged martial arts icon.

Lee, who was born in San Francisco 
but raised in Hong Kong, died at the height of his fame due to an 
allergic reaction to painkillers at the age of 32.

His last film, Enter 
the Dragon, was released six days after his death and became his most 
popular movie.

Shannon
Lee, who was just four-years-old when her father died, said people 
often assume she is similar skilled in martial arts when they realise 
she is the kung fu icon's daughter.

'People
immediately assume that I am some amazingly skilled and deadly martial 
artist,' said Ms Lee, 44, who said she has studied martial arts in the 
past, but pursued a career in business.

Power: The exhibition in Hong Kong, at the centre of which is this impressive statue of Lee, will run for five years

Ms
Lee, who has a 10-year-old daughter, Wren, and is president of the 
Bruce Lee Foundation, said that, while he is a legend in the world of 
martial arts, there was more to her father than his astonishing kung fu 
skills.

She hopes the new exhibition will 
show a more 'complete picture' by revealing Lee's family side, the 
poetry he wrote, and the effort that went into creating apparently 
effortless action scenes in his movies, she said.

'I
think a lot of people see the 
final product up on screen and they go, "Oh, there's a talented guy", 
but they don't see all the effort that went into it,' she said.

Ms Lee
said working to promote her father's legacy was inspiring because she 
gets to see 'how many lives he's touched in such a positive way, and if I
can keep that going, that's meaningful'.
