Bosses of the new Battersea Power Station development have taken their plans for the iconic site on the road as they try to tempt the world's rich to take up residence in south London.

Actress Kate Beckinsale fronted a 'launch party' in Hollywood last night in the latest of a series of events aimed at attracting foreign buyers to snap up flats on the banks of the River Thames.

Glitzy public exhibitions have now been held in Paris, New York, Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur last week, followed by shows in Tokyo, Beijing, Doha and Milan this week.

The Hollywood event came after businessmen and women in Shanghai were shown plans for the site last week

The events around the world came after rock star Sting and his wife Trudie Styler confirmed they will be among the future tenants living in the redeveloped towers. 

Developers are keen to get world-famous stars and international businessmen and women into some of the 4,000 apartments being built on the famous site, which is to have its own tube station.

Apartments in the power station vary widely in price and size. Studios are available from £495,000, one bedroom apartments being sold for £595,000 and four bedroom apartments for £3million.

Prices for the sprawling penthouses - which are likely to attract super-rich buyers - have not been released, but experts predicted they could cost as much as £30million.

Miss Beckinsale - star of Pearl Harbour and Underworld - was seen chatting with development bosses last night, sparking rumours she could be about to follow Sting in buying one of the properties.

Mad Men actor Jared Harris, Dancing with the Stars dancer Sharna Burgess and actress Hayley Hasselhoff, daughter of Baywatch actor David, were seen walking the red carpet at the launch event last night.

Last last month, Sting became among the first to snap up an apartment in the redeveloped towers, adding to  his long list of properties around the world.

His wife Trudie Styler said: 'The exciting development plans for the whole site are a great solution for the regeneration of an iconic London landmark which has been in decay for the last 30 years.

'We are both very pleased to be part of this new community and really look forward to making our London home at the Battersea Power Station.'

Exclusive launch events around the world have featured DJs and musicians in a bid to create a buzz around the London development

Commenting on the events around the world, development chairman Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin said: 'The simultaneous global launch to find the most creative businesses, exciting fashion, retail, food brands and restaurants to bring alive each phase of the development at Battersea Power Station is an momentous milestone on our journey to create a new flourishing community in central London.

'By bringing the very best of UK and international businesses to the site, we will create one of the most wonderful places to live, work and visit in the capital.'

The redevelopment of Battersea Power Station, which is costing £8billion, will see the 42 acre site transformed into a riverside town for thousands of people.

After years of failed bids to redevelop it, the he site was bought by Real Estate Opportunities and the project was given planning permission in 2010. It is expected to be completed by 2025.

The power station itself, which has been closed to the public for 30 years, is expected to be opened in 2019.

The development of the iconic building, which will be converted into flats, is expected to be finished by 2025

The site has sat disused for years but plans for its re-development are finally under way after getting planning permission in 2010

Models of the modern-looking apartment blocks are now being taken around the world to encourage buyers

Work has already started at the site, where rock star Sting announced he had bought a flat last month

At the heart of the scheme called Prospect Place, will be Gehry's Flower building - a striking structure which will offer residents a lounge, library, a large chef's table dining room, a yoga studio and treatment rooms.

London-based Foster + Partners have designed a building inspired by the 1930s which will be topped by one of the city's largest roof gardens offering spectacular panoramic views of London.

The development will also house 103 affordable homes.

The redevelopment of Battersea Power Station will create 15,000 new jobs, 3,500 new homes and a privately-funded extension of the London Underground at Nine Elms and Battersea Power Station.
