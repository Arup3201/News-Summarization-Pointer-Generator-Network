Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal believes English football’s tradition of playing back to back games over Christmas and New Year is in danger of damaging the image of the Barclays Premier League.

Van Gaal’s United team looked like a team badly in need of a rest as they struggled to break down Tottenham on Sunday and are now preparing for vital games at Stoke City on New Year’s Day and in the FA Cup at Yeovil on Sunday.

The Dutch veteran understands that his rivals at the top end of the Premier League have the same problems but claimed on Tuesday that the English way has a direct and negative impact on the football that is shown all around the world at this time of year.

Van Gaal said: 'Everybody knows that a body cannot recover within 48 hours.

'Therefore, there is a rule at UEFA and FIFA that you cannot play the games so close. Okay, that I have said.

'That’s scientifically proven, I have said that also.

'Everybody knows that and in spite of that, we have to play.

'It’s the culture of England. I don’t mind but it is not good for the players, for the health of the players and what I say now is it is not good for the game because I think that the FA, but also the fans, want attractive games.

'But it doesn’t happen.

'You have seen the second half at Tottenham. You have seen the second half of Chelsea against Southampton.

'The football was not good.”

With United encouraged by the fact that neither Chelsea or Manchester City managed to better their own draw at the weekend, Van Gaal believes there is better to come for his improving team.

Key players such as Anders Herrera and Angel di Maria are not yet ready to return but defenders Chris Smalling, Rafael da Silva and Luke Shaw are available for starting berths now.

Van Gaal added: 'I think we are still in a process. I think everyone can see that we are improving every week in spite of a lot of injuries, and that’s because of the philosophy.

'I think the players understand the philosophy, and that’s why we are improving – but we can improve more when we have all the players available.

'I think the fans were fantastic because we were in a moment with 11 matches and 13 points – that is not good, I think more weak than good.

'In spite of that, the fans have supported us always and in the right way. I want to thank the fans for that.

'I think we can be satisfied about the points now – 36 points. We are in our goal, I think.

'What I have already said, we are improving every week. We can see 2015 with open eyes.'

Van Gaal was also asked to reflect on his time at first six months in England and revealed that it had surpassed expectations.

'English life is fantastic because I have met only friendly people on the streets and in the restaurants where I come,' added Van Gaal.

'The food is fantastic because when I came to England everybody said the food is not good, but [it is] fantastic.

'Also, the wine list is fantastic.

'I have very nice neighbours; they are all older than me but very nice. I live in a surrounding environment [that is] fantastic.'
