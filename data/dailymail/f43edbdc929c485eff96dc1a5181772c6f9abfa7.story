British Muslims have greater belief in the police than the rest of the population according to new research published today. 

A study in the British Journal of Criminology found that six out of ten Muslims rate the police as either good or excellent, compared with 53 per cent of the non-Muslim population.

Researchers analysed crime data surveys in England and Wales between 2006 and 2010. The findings were published in the British Journal of Criminology. 

British Muslims, such as these young women celebrating the festival of Eid in Trafalgar Square in London  have greater faith in the police than the rest of society according to new research published today 

The survey also conducted 50,000 doorstep interviews, which the Home Office said provides a better indication of the true level of crime, as not all incidents are reported to police. 

According to the Independent, the survey also investigated the probability of Muslims being the victims of crime.

However, the author of the report Julian Hargreaves of Cambridge's Centre of Islamic Studies said: 'It's often reported that Muslim individual are more likely to be at risk of violent crime than other communities. But not only is violent crime a rare occurance, it's no more likely to affect Muslims than others, such as Hindus and Sikhs.' 

Researchers admitted that the survey does not include attacks against property, possibly under-estimating the extent of anti-Islamic crime.

The new research, affirming support in the British Muslim community for the police comes as fears grow over the number of people being radicalised by Islamic extremists. 

The Government has introduced a new counter-terrorism bill to combat the threat of British men and women becoming jihadists.  

Labour MP Khalid Mahmood believes British jihadists are being able to enter the country due to lax security

It is believed that several hundred British Muslims have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS and other extremist Islamic groups. 

Khalid Mahmood, MP for the Birmingham Perry Barr constituency, claimed that official figures on the numbers of British jihadis is grossly underestimating the size of the problem. 

UK security officials believe in the region of 500 men have travelled to Iraq and Syria, but Mr Mahmood claims this figure is widely inaccurate. 

He said: 'The authorities say there are 500 British jihadists but the likely figure is at least three to four times that. I think 2,000 is a better estimate. My experience in Birmingham is it is a huge, huge problem.' 

Mr Mahmood said: 'The Government does not have significant people at border control. The fact is these jihadists are coming in and going out without almost ever being arrested. We have had hardly any arrests. We have had people coming back in after six months in Syria and they are not being picked up.'

Mr Mahmood's warning follows reports that British jihadis Abu Dharda, 20 and Abu Abdullah al Habashi, 21. 

The two men from London are believed to have been killed in heavy fighting in the Syrian border town of Kobane, which has been the subject of a major counter-offensive by Kurdish fighters, supported by US Air Force bombers.  

Al-Habashi grew up in north London in a British-Eritrean family and converted to Islam at the age of 16. 

He told the BBC back in August that he was one of the few British jihadists who fought with ISIS in Syria and Iraq. 

During the interview, he admitted that he was never going to return to Britain despite the pleas of his family. 

Dhardra grew up in west London and is from a British-Somali background. He entered Syria in December 2013 after crossing the Turkish border. 

Abu Abdullah al-Habashi, left, and Abu Dharda, right, are believed to have been killed in Kobane, Syria 

Almost 30 Britons are believed to have been killed fighting for jihadist organisations although the Foreign Office confirmed that determining exact figures is incredibly difficult. 

A spokesman said: 'We are aware of reports of the death of two British nationals in Syria.

'The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, where all UK consular services are suspended.

'As we do not have any representation in Syria, it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting British nationals there are extremely limited.'
