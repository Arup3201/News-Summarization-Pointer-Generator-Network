A Labour politician has spoken out about losing his virginity at the age of five to an alien holographic.

Simon Parkes, a councillor in Whitby, North Yorkshire, says he has been visited and taken by extra-terrestrials ever since being in his mother's womb, and has no fear of them.

The 53-year-old added that anyone who felt his beliefs made him an unsuitable representative for Stakesby should not worry, as he is never taken by the aliens during meetings since they do not like large gatherings of people.

The Councillor and driving instructor appeared on ITV's This Morning today to explain to Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield that he wished to destigmatise alien visitations and encourage others like him to come forward with their stories.

He said that only by thousands of people coming forward every day would the media's attitude change.

Cllr Parkes explained that he had been visited by aliens ever since being inside his mother's womb, when he has 'a very clear 
memory of a face with no real distinguishing features', and then 'suddenloy being 
aware that there was much more to this world than i knew'. He describes it as 'a spiritual experience'.

He said that the type of alien he was most frequently visited by were Mantids - green, seven feet tall - and produced his drawing of one who frequently comes to visit him wearing a cloak.

Cllr Parkes then described losing his virginity to one of the aliens in 1965, when he was five or six years old.

He said: 'It was a holographic sexual experience so I didn't exactly lose my virginity... it was using much more advanced technology than anything we have on Earth, or anything the army think they have. To aliens it's not about age, it's about experience and souls.'

Aware that 'some people can't handle the truth', Cllr Parkes suggested that anyone who felt he was unsuitable for the role of Councillor in Whitby instead 'vent your angry spleen on those members of parliament who stole money, 
who defrauded the country, who got others to take penalty points for 
them, on those great tycoons and bankers who nearly destroyed Britain'.

He added: 'When i was elected I'd already gone public. What people want is someone 
to fights and defend Whitby. My policies are very strong and very clear. Nobody has askedÂ  me to resign because this is a private matter.'

When Philip wondered if being taken by aliens might clash with his duties, Parkes said: 'I am not taken during meetings. These creatures do not want attention 
drawn to themselves. And they don't have an agenda or oppose me discussing this, otherwise i wouild have 
been stopped.'

Cllr Parkes has already spoken publicly about rowing with his wife after revealing he had a child called Zarka with an alien he refers to as the Cat Queen.

The driving instructor said he has sexual relations with the alien about four times a year.

'What will happen is that we will hold hands and I will say "I'm ready" and then the technology I don't understand will take us up to a craft orbiting the earth,' he explained.

'My wife found out about it and was very unhappy, clearly. That caused a few problems, but it is not on a human level, so I don't see it as wrong.'

Cllr Parkes, who also claims his 'real mother' is a 9ft green alien with eight fingers, said people only claim he is mad because they have not shared his experiences and that the encounters don't affect his work on behalf of Whitby residents.

'I can understand how you would say that because you have not seen anything yourself and that's your immediate fall-back position, but you come and spend some time with me and follow me around for a day and you will actually walk away shaking your head because you will think actually he's not mad.

'There are plenty of people in my position who don't chose to come out and say it because they are terrified it will destroy their careers.'

He told Channel 4 documentary Confessions Of An Alien Abductee his first recollection is of being lifted out of his cot by an alien.

Married Labour councillor Simon Parkes, 53, who represents Stakesby on Whitby Town Council, has defended his beliefs in extra terrestrial life, after he made outlandish claims on national television that he has fathered a child with an alien

Councillor Parkes, who spends hours 
drawing his extra-terrestrial experiences as it helps him to comes to 
terms with them, said: 'The only thing I can remember after that is it 
saying to me you will never be hurt, your will never be harmed.

'I think I am fairly clear in my head that I am being monitored [by aliens] very closely and if there is anything that's seriously about to happen or does happen then I am fairly confident in my own mind that they will intervene, they have in the past.'

He said he is also often followed by the security services and that he and a female passenger in his car were recently abducted by aliens in Cloughton, near Scarborough, before being returned to the vehicle as it moved.'
