Two sixth-form sweethearts who fled to the Caribbean after sneaking out of their £30,000-a-year public school will not be forced to cut short their holiday by police, but will face their furious parents.

Edward
 Bunyan and Indira Gainiyeva, both 16, left their exclusive Catholic 
school in the middle of the night and flew to the Dominican Republic, and are at a five-star beach resort on the island.

Lancashire Police have been working with the children's parents, 
with Edward's mother and father believed to be living in north Spain and Indira's in 
Kyzylorda in Kazakhstan.

But despite
 the international hunt to find the runaways, police will not be dragging them back to the UK and instead the parents will be heading to the Caribbean to find them.

'We have still not found the 
missing teenagers, we do have a rough idea where they are located and 
are working with international authorities to help locate them,' a police spokesman said.

'We 
are working closely with the teenagers' parents, who live abroad, and 
one is hoping to travel out to the island to meet them.

'When 
officers locate the duo, they will not be dragged back in cuffs - 
instead it is our priority to locate them safely as they remain as being
 reported missing.'

Friends at the prestigious 
£29,439-a-year Stonyhurst College in Clitheroe, Lancashire, say the 
lovers had returned to the new term last week with a bad case of the 
post-Christmas holiday blues.

The youngsters' escape ploy from the 'Alcatraz-like' school has been hailed 'genius' and 'hilarious' by their classmates.

A
 close friend, who asked to remain anonymous, revealed joker Edward may 
have been taking part in a stalwart tradition among pupil's at the 
school called 'hen banter'.

The
 source said: 'Hen banter is traditional among sixth form students - 
it's all about revolting against new rules and doing things to push 
boundaries.

'It is about upholding Stonyhurst traditional values. I think Edward must have had this in mind before embarking on his journey.

'And
 he's really taken it to a new level - it's safe to say they won't be 
going back to school in Stonyhurst after such a stunt.'

Officers
 are working with the school to investigate how they managed to hoodwink
 the 24-hour security guards who patrol the building.

Another friend said: 'Boys and girls are kept far apart at night in separate wings and doors are locked by 11.

'It
 would have been hard for them to get out as security guards patrol the 
buildings at night - it's like escaping from Alcatraz.

'Everyone's
 cheering the pair on and hoping they can go a bit further without being
 found - it's completely rocked the school's staff though.'

A
 spokesman for the school said: 'We are not aware of any school 
traditions amongst pupils. We are still working with officers to help 
locate the pair.

'Finding them safely is our priority.'

Edward Bunyan and Indira Gainiyeva left their exclusive Catholic school in Lancashire in the middle of the night

It is thought local police have traced the couple, but have not approached them directly. 

Their parents were believed to be due to land in the Dominican Republic last night.

A source said: ‘They have been traced by officers but were apparently enjoying themselves in the sunshine at a beach resort.

Tired of the persistent rain and cold and desperate for a bit of sunshine, they booked flights to the Dominican Republic on the internet before vanishing.

They sneaked out with their suitcases at 3am on Monday and took a £100 taxi ride to Manchester airport.

They were last spotted at terminal three before boarding an indirect flight to the Caribbean.

Indira, who is originally from Kazakhstan, enrolled at the 468-pupil school in September to study A-levels after attending Ovingdean Hall International Language College near her family home in Brighton to learn English.

Edward, originally from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, who has dual British and Spanish citizenship, is believed to have joined in 2010 after studying in Algerciras in Spain, and Canada.

Stonyhurst is a prestigious Catholic school whose former pupils include Sherlock Holmes author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and former BBC director general Mark Thompson.

Last night a source said: ‘Edward is one of the cool kids. He’s a bit of a rebel but is quite mature for his age as he has lived all over the place.

‘He hooked up with Indira and they have been seeing a lot of each other at the school and their romance was an open secret among pupils.

‘It can be pretty miserable at a bleak 15th century Jesuit school in the middle of winter and close friends say they had a bad case of the post-holiday blues.

‘They only came back from the Christmas break a week ago, but Edward apparently suggested they banish the blues by booking a break in the Caribbean and off they went. It was a surprise to everyone.’ 

The source added: ‘They are both seasoned travellers so hopping on to a jet for a flight to the Caribbean was less of a big deal than it would be for other kids.’ 

One pupil at the school said: ‘Ed’s very calm and friendly, and to be honest, I’m a little shocked he did this – they’ve pulled off quite an incredible stunt.

‘It would have been hard for them to get out as security guards patrol the buildings at night – it’s like escaping from Alcatraz. 

‘Boys and girls are kept far apart at night in separate wings and doors are locked by 10pm.’ 

A spokesman for Stonyhurst College said: ‘Two of our sixth-formers left the  college during the course of  Monday morning.’

She added: ‘We have been working with their families and the police, who believe they may now have traced their location.’ 

A police spokesman said: ‘We believe that we know their location and we are currently working with foreign police services to track them down.

‘We are making inquiries at the moment to find out their exact location. We are concerned about their safety due to their age and the fact that they are travelling together without any adults.’ 

Pictures on Edward’s Facebook page show him smoking cigarettes and one features the caption, ‘**** the world’. 

Another says: ‘For every dark night, there’s a brighter day.’ 

Fellow pupils inundated social media websites with comments about the drama, with many  saying Edward and Indira had become ‘legends’ at the school.

Students on Twitter quickly started trending the hashtags #wheresbunyan and #hideandseek, with one saying: ‘Bunyan should be knighted.’
