Murdered: Property developer William John Saunderson-Smith was killed in his own home in West London

A man who was found brutally murdered in his house is a secretive multi-millionaire who stashed ‘mind-boggling’ sums of cash around his homes, police have said.

Officers investigating the death of businessman William John Saunderson-Smith have been stunned by his mysterious lifestyle.

Mr Saunderson-Smith was found bludgeoned to death in the attic bedroom of his £850,000 home in West Kensington, west London on the afternoon of October 21.

Scotland Yard forensic teams have found wads of £20 and £50 notes stuffed in plastic bags as they strip the building bare in the hunt for clues about the killing.

They have so far uncovered around £150,000 in cash at the reclusive property developer's home in Dewhurst Road, where his body was found, and also at a property on nearby Sedlescombe Road.

No weapon has yet been discovered and no arrests have been made.

Police believe Mr Saunderson-Smith used different identities to conceal a sprawling property empire that spanned London, Dorset and overseas.

The 58-year-old is suspected of living ‘under the radar’ for decades, demanding cash from tenants and concealing his affairs from the authorities.

Mr Saunderson-Smith was known to frequent gay clubs in central London but police, who admit details on the circumstances leading to his death remain 'sketchy', are not treating it as a homophobic crime.

At first investigators suspected he may have been attacked by burglars as they searched the three-storey property for valuables.

But a finger-tip search of the 
property, which was being refurbished and split into flats, uncovered a 
‘mind-boggling’ amount of hidden cash.

His car was littered with more than 80 documents, some dating back many
years, suggesting the victim may own yet more property.

But despite his huge property portfolio and wealth, police can find little trace of him on official databases and records.

They have yet to trace any relatives or business partners and have uncovered only a handful of acquaintances.

Detectives have discovered Mr 
Saunderson-Smith, who was known as ‘John’, used slight variations of his
name and different birth dates on official paperwork.

Detective Chief Inspector Howard 
Groves, who is leading the inquiry, said the key to finding his killers 
may lie in unravelling his background.

He said: ‘We are trying to establish 
whether he could have fallen out with anyone and details about his 
private life. This is an individual who has always been on his own.

'At present, details regarding Mr Saunderson-Smith's life, and the events leading up to his death, remain sketchy.

'Whilst local inquiries are ongoing, 
we are now extending our appeals to anyone who knew Mr Saunderson-Smith 
from his frequent visits to gay clubs in and around the Old Brompton 
Road and Kennington areas.

'This could be crucial in assisting us to build a complete picture about his life. I must stress that we are not treating this as a homophobic crime. However, we are keeping an open mind as to the reasons behind his murder.

'We understand that Mr Saunderson-Smith had a number of people in his life through business and leisure interests. I am urging anyone who knew him to contact us.'

He added: ‘There is an awful lot we do not know about him. We have a mountain to climb in establishing his business interests.

‘Then there are his family and 
friends. Here is someone who has lived a lonely existence for many 
years. He does not seem to have a large circle of friends or family.

‘It would appear he has got a large property portfolio and it is one that extends beyond these shores.

‘We have spent a week going through 
his property. We have recovered a significant amount of cash – it is 
mind-boggling, it beggars belief.’

Mr Saunderson-Smith died from a series
of savage blows to his head sometime between the evening of Thursday 
October 20 and the following afternoon.

Police found a window at the Dewhurst 
Road house was unlocked but are not sure if the killer broke in or came through the front door.

Forensic officers have spent more than
a week scouring the property which is full of building debris, 
construction materials and junk.

The victim told some people he had inherited ‘a lot of money’ but police are not convinced this is true.

Mr Saunderson-Smith bought the property where he died in 1981 and let it out to dozens of tenants over the past 30 years.

He also owned six £300,000 flats at a development in Wimbledon as well as rental homes in Dorset.

Police said he was a ‘meticulous’ landlord who only rented his properties to employed professionals and kept detailed records.

Tenants said their landlord was 
‘untraceable’. One said: ‘It will be a struggle to find him. We simply 
don’t know anything about him.’

The victim represented himself at a 
series of tribunal hearings in which residents complained about the size
of their rents and his refusal to pay other charges.

Police have been unable to trace Mr 
Saunderson-Smith’s family, but believe he is originally from the 
Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire areas.

They suspect someone may come forward as a result of publicity around the size of his personal fortune.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said no-one has been arrested over the murder and a weapon has not been recovered.
