Two days before President Barack Obama's first trip outside Washington to promote his gun-control proposals, the White House tried on Saturday to settle a brewing mystery by releasing a photo to back his claim to be a skeet shooter.

Obama had set inquiring minds spinning when, in an interview with The New Republic magazine, he answered ‘yes’ when asked if he had ever fired a gun. The admission came as a surprise to many.

‘Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time,’ Obama said in the interview released last weekend, referring to the official presidential retreat in rural Maryland, which he last visited in October while campaigning for re-election.

Asked whether the entire family participates, the president said: ‘Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there.’

Then on Saturday morning, the White House released the photo of Obama 
shooting at clay pigeons at the presidential retreat at Camp David in 
Maryland.

Former White House senior adviser David Plouffe couldn't resist mocking those who might claim the photograph of President 
Obama shooting was fake and tweeted: 'Attention skeet birthers. Make our day - let the photoshop conspiracies begin!'

White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer also joined in the teasing and tweeted the picture of the President with a shout-out to the 'skeeters' - namely people who might claim the image is false.

Both men received a large amount of online abuse for their attempts at humor.

The image of a U.S. president holding a gun is certainly nothing new. A number of men who have held the highest office in America have been pictured holding guns, from Theodore Roosevelt to George W. Bush.

The shooting range at Camp David was installed by President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s.

The retired Army general enjoyed shooting and even brought visiting dignitaries, including Prince Charles, to join him.

Presidents
John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush are among the former 
U.S. leaders who have also been photographed packing heat.

Mr Obama's predecessor, 43rd
President George W. Bush, is an avid hunter who enjoyed the sport at 
his ranch in Crawford, Texas - which was dubbed the 'Western White 
House' during his tenure.

His Vice-President, Dick Cheney, also 
enjoyed the practice but landed in a tight spot when he accidentally hit
his shooting companion, Texas millionaire Harry Whittington, while 
quail hunting on a Texas ranch in February 2006.

The image of President Obama shooting at clay targets was released at a time when he is pushing a package of gun-control measures in response to the Newtown, Conn., school shooting.

The National Rifle Association, which has rejected Obama's proposals, scoffed at the photo.

‘One picture does not erase a lifetime of supporting every gun ban and every gun-control scheme imaginable,’ said Andrew Arulanandam, the organization's spokesman.

The NRA opposes Obama's call for 
Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines 
and says requiring background checks for all gun purchases would be 
ineffective because the administration isn't doing enough to enforce 
existing gun laws.

Asked
at Monday's press briefing how frequently Obama shoots skeet and 
whether photos existed, White House press secretary Jay Carney said he 
didn't know how often. Pictures may exist, he said, but he hadn't seen 
any.

‘Why haven't we heard about it before?’ Carney was asked.

‘Because
when he goes to Camp David, he goes to spend time with his family and 
friends and relax, not to produce photographs,’ Carney said.

Obama is accompanied almost everywhere by at least one White House photographer.

Carney declined to comment on the decision to release the photo, which he had announced on Twitter.

The
release appeared to be part of a strategy to portray Obama as 
sympathetic to gun owners and opponents of his gun-control measures who 
argue the proposals would infringe on an individual's Second Amendment 
right to bear arms.

A top official with the National Skeet Shooting Association said the photo suggests Obama is a novice shooter.

‘This
isn't something he's done very often because of how he's standing, how 
he has the gun mounted,’ said Michael Hampton, executive director of the
San Antonio-based association.

Hampton
said Obama's remark about ‘skeet shooting all the time’ and the White 
House photo would have met less skepticism had the president spoken 
about his hobby months before this new debate over guns in the U.S.

‘Once it becomes controversial and there's problems, to talk about it then, that's where it becomes very debatable and is not being received as well as if he would have done this six months ago,’ Hampton said.

In interview, appearing in The New Republic's Feb. 11 issue, Obama said gun-control advocates should be better listeners in the debate over firearms, which was sparked by the December killing of elementary school pupils in Connecticut. He also declared his deep respect for the long tradition of hunting in this country.

‘I have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations. And I think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake,’ Obama said.

‘Part of being able to move this forward
is understanding the reality of guns in urban areas are very different 
from the realities of guns in rural areas. And if you grew up and your 
dad gave you a hunting rifle when you were 10, and you went out and 
spent the day with him and your uncles, and that became part of your 
family's traditions, you can see why you'd be pretty protective of 
that.’

'So it's trying to bridge those gaps that I think is going to be part of the biggest task over the next several months. And that means that advocates of gun control have to do a little more listening than they do sometimes,' Obama said.

His gun control measures also have met resistance on Capitol Hill.

In Minneapolis on Monday, Obama plans to make remarks and discuss his proposals with local and law enforcement officials during a stop at the police department's special operations center. He's also expected to hear from community members about their experiences with gun violence.

Obama announced his proposals in mid-January, about a month after the Dec. 14 shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.
