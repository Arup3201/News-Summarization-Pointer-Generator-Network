Etan Patz's best friend has recalled in court how she saved the six-year-old boy a seat on the bus on the morning he vanished but he never turned up.

Chelsea Altman, now an actress and Brooklyn restaurant owner, wept as she testified in the murder trial for Pedro Hernandez, who is on trial for killing the missing child more than 30 years ago.

Altman, whose family lived opposite the Patz family on Prince Street in SoHo, took the stand on Monday and recalled the morning of May 25, 1979, when Patz failed to get on the bus. 

When she returned home from school that day, she picked up a call from Etan's worried mother, Julie Patz, and told her that she didn't know where the boy was.

'She was shocked,' she told Manhattan Supreme Court, DNAinfo reported. 'She was very upset.'

Altman, who is now a mother herself, recalled how Etan was 'very curious and sweet, a little mischievous but not rebellious' and how excited they both were that their families were planning on taking a vacation together.

She added how Etan had spoken about taking a trip with a friend called Johnny, who he said had a van and candy, but she said she believed this was just an imaginary friend.

She also testified how Susan Harrington, who was paid to walk her and Etan home on occasion, would sometimes meet them with a man - but she denied he looked like Jose Ramos, a long-time suspect in the case and a convicted pedophile.

Altman, who owns restaurants Olea and Allswell in Brooklyn, took the stand on the second day of testimony in the murder trial for Hernandez, who had worked in a shop in the area at the time.

Earlier that day, Etan's mother, 72-year-old Julie Patz, described the moment she saw her son for the last time 35 years ago.

She told the jury the youngster was trusting but also scared of being lost or alone and broke into tears when describing her feelings when she realized her son was missing.

Her testimony was the only time she will appear in court because she cannot bear to go through the trial and be reminded of what happened.

She arrived at the court separately for her husband Stan, who turned up with his daughter Shira, and was not wearing a wedding ring.  

Mrs Patz recounted her time living in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood when her son, Etan, was little and how he vanished after she allowed him to walk to school alone for the first time.

'That was the last time I saw him. I watched him walk one block away. I turned around and went back upstairs and that was the last time.'

Etan had asked his mother if he could walk to catch the school bus on his own. She initially said no but capitulated. On the day he went missing she told him to go straight to the bodega and get a drink with money he had been saving up. 

'I reminded him to come directly home from school, no side trips anywhere,' she said. 

She told the court how the store, where Hernandez worked as a youngster, was dark, dirty and poorly stocked. However because of the location other parents in the neighborhood would often tell the children to meet there in an emergency.

The boy was 'totally outgoing and trusting of everyone — totally nonjudgmental about people,' his mother said. 'Everyone that he met once was his friend and was a nice person.' 

But while Etan craved independence and was eager to become a grown-up, Patz said, 'at the same time he was very fearful of being lost or left alone by himself.'

Mrs Patz cried when talking about how she felt in the hours after she learned Etan was missing.

'I don't remember a thing about that night and the next day, quite honestly,' she said. She recalls only having 'very rubbery legs,' an upset stomach and difficulty walking, thinking and talking. 

'Our home became police headquarters. Global command. It was very strange.' 

'It was not fun,' she added. 'Our children were handed off to neighbors and friends because our house was a madhouse. It's been more like a circus than anything else.' 

Asking questions from prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, she said women in her neighborhood criticized her for playing and laughing with her children just months after Etan vanished.

She also became emotional when she started describing the impact the case which has spanned three decades has had on her children.

'My daughter and my son, this has been almost their entire lives,' she said. 'It's very difficult to continuously try to regain a sense of normalcy in your daily life (while having it) constantly being pulled out from under you with new developments in the case, new leads or whatever,' she said.  

After the coverage surrounding her son's disappearance died down in the 1980's she shied away from the spotlight. Her husband Stan started making most of the appearances in public.

She has only been seen at a handful of court dates. 

Hernandez said in his videotaped confession that he had lured the youngster into the basement of the store and strangled him. 

During the investigation in 1979, New York police jotted down his name among those of many people they met during their feverish search.

But it wasn't until 2012 that Hernandez emerged as a suspect. The apparent breakthrough in the case was based on a tip and a videotaped confession that prosecutors say was foreshadowed by remarks he made to friends and relatives in the 1980s.

His defense hinges on convincing jurors that the confession is false, along with suggesting that the real killer may be a convicted Pennsylvania child molester who was a prime suspect for years. 

Etan became one of the first missing children featured on milk cartons. His parents helped advocate for legislation that created a nationwide law enforcement framework to address such cases, and the anniversary of his disappearance became National Missing Children's Day.

The trial is expected to last up to three months. Witnesses are expected to include psychologists, an inmate informant who knows Hernandez, and possibly other informants testifying against the earlier suspect.
