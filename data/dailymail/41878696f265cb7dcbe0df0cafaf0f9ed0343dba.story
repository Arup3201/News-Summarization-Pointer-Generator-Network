Borussia Dortmund midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan has been ruled out for six weeks with a muscle tear in his right thigh.

The Armenian playmaker had to be taken off in the 35th minute during Saturday's 1-0 loss at Hertha Berlin, a defeat that leaves his side in the relegation zone with two games left before the winter break.

Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp said: 'He felt a tweak, which isn't good in a three-game week.'
