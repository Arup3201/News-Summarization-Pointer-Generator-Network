A football fan has had an entire football terrace built in his bedroom to house his collection of 5,000 miniature footballers.

Craig Robinson, 27, a clothes shop boss from Scunthorpe, has been collecting Corinthian figurines - which look just like star players - since buying an Alan Shearer figurine in 1995 when he was just nine.

Mr Robinson has the largest collection of the models in the world having snapped up all 5,000 figures - affectionally called 'little big heads' by fans - ever made.

The final player needed for his collection was former Arsenal star Stefan Schwarz, which he bought on eBay last year to complete his collection.

Mr Robinson claims his obsession had cost him thousands of pounds, but that since the figures stopped being made in 2008 the value of his collection has rocketed, making them now worth a staggering £25,000.

He said that his collection was so vast he wanted to 'show them off' to everyone, and got dad Anthony to make him a four-storey football terrace to display them all in his bedroom.

Craig revealed his room to the world after landing his dream job with Capital One - which sponsored this year's League Cup and ended in Swansea hammering Bradford 5-0.

The Newcastle United fan is the new head of quality control for Capital One's competition in which 1,000 entrants will be chosen to have Corinthian models made in their own image.

Mr Robinson is even getting one of the models made to look just like him.

He added: 'I've got every single one of the Corinthian figures ever made and I've insured my collection for £25,000.

'My dad built me a four-storey football terrace in my bedroom so I can display every single one of the players at the same time.'I love them all, especially the lesser known players who everyone has forgotten by now, but who were heroes to me at the time.'

Michael Woodburn, Capital One's Chief Marketing Officer, said: 'We're pleased to have Craig on board to make this project as authentic and successful as possible. 

'Who better than Britain's top collector to make sure that our Capital One Cup models are delivered to the best possible quality?'
