While most of us were celebrating as the clock struck midnight, some were enduring a very different New Year's Eve experience - among them the parents of the babies born as Big Ben's bongs chimed out.

First off the mark was Lethea Rankine, from Edgbaston in Birmingham, who gave birth to her 7lb 7oz daughter Gracie just seconds after midnight.

She was followed into the world by Martin Oglivie, from West Lothian, and Edward Sutheran and Lola-Jai Fenton, both from Coventry, who put in an appearance in the early hours of New Year's Day.

Speedy arrival: Little Gracie Welcome, from Birmingham, was born as Big Ben chimed midnight

Gracie, weighing in at 7lbs 7oz, is the latest addition to a family who share their birthdays with big occasions.

Gracie’s great-grandmother Adina Seymour and grandmother Georganne Rankine were both born on Christmas Day. And Gracie’s grandad, Leighton Rankine, was born on December 31.

Cradling Gracie, who was born by caesarian section, in her arms, her proud mother Lethea said: 'She’s so beautiful. It was exciting knowing she was born just as the new year arrived.'

The 22-year-old added: 'My waters broke at about 9.30am on the morning of New Year’s Eve. Then my contractions started about 7.30 in the evening. She came at 12 on the dot! Well, ten seconds past 12.'

Proud: Parents Lethea Rankine, 22, and Romeo Welcome, 27, say they are delighted by the new arrival

Second: Martin Ogilvie was born at 12.01am at St Johns Hospital in Livingston, Scotland to Colleen

But Lethea, who moved to the UK from the Cayman Islands two years ago, said the birth brought mixed emotions.

'It was terrifying, painful and I just wanted to get it over with,' she added. '[Gracie's father Romeo Welcome] says she looks like him!

'We’ve been on the phone to my family and everyone was so excited. There must be something in the genes about birthdays.'

In all, 11 babies were born at the Birmingham hospital on New Year’s Day. Hospital spokeswoman Nichola Robinson said: 'It’s quite a high number in such a short space of time.'

Poignant: Martin's parents Edward and Colleen suffered the loss of his twin in the same hospital in November
