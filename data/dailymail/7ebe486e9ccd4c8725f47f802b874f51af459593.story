A thief someone stole a Salvation Army kettle from a bell ringer who left his post to help a grandmother and her four grandchildren get through the double doors at a shopping mall in North Carolina.

Winston-Salem police say bell ringer James Griffin III told them when returned from the Belk store to his post, the kettle and the $50 in it were gone.

Police Lt. Brad Yandell says there is no video of Tuesday's theft, and investigators have no leads.

Maj. James Allison, commander of the Salvation Army of Winston-Salem, says the agency would have helped if the thief had a need.

Griffin returned to his post on Wednesday, and the Belk store manager put $100 into the replacement kettle.
