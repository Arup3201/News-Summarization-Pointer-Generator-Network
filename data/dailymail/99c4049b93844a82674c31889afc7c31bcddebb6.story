A mother whose two young children were butchered in their own homes - allegedly by their own nanny - has revealed how despair overwhelmed her in the days following the brutal murder.

Marina Krim, 38, found six-year-old Lucia and one-year-old Leo stabbed to death in her apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side apartment.

Yoselyn Ortega, their nanny, stands accused of taking a knife to the children and then cutting her own throat in the grisly October 2012 killings.

Grief: Marina Krim, left with her husband Kevin, spoke of her grief at a fundraiser for the couple's murdered children this week

The shocking deaths, which Marina discovered when she brought her other daughter Nessie, then three, home from swimming, made it seem impossible to go on.

Marina said: 'I was sitting in the hospital, Nessie clinging to my chest - and I was asking over and over to anybody who would listen, "What am I supposed to do tomorrow? How do I do this? What do we do?"'

Nobody could tell her anything, she recalled in a speech earlier this week, leaving her and her husband Kevin desperate for answers, People magazine reported.

Victims: Lucia, left, and Leo, right, were found dead in their Upper West Side apartment by Marina, who was bringing their sister Nessie back from a swimming class

Accused: Ortega, picture in a court hearing last year, has denied that she killed the children

She said: 'The hospital workers looked at me with a blank stare. A few days later, Kevin and I met some of the top psychiatrists in New York City, and they didn't have a reassuring answer for us either.'

But the couple eventually found a way out of their daily suffering and bewilderment - guided in part by the example of their three-year-old.

She said: 'I remember looking at our daughter Nessie in the darkest days and I so admired her ability to just live in the present... Though she missed her siblings, she was laughing and enjoying herself and making every heartbroken person in the room smile.'

Fundraiser: Marina spoke of her grief and despair at an event held by the Lulu & Leo Fund, which supports arts and science programs for children

Guests: The crowds at the City of New York Museum of Fifth Avenue bid for glamorous lots and listened to performers

Speech: Marina said Nessie helped provide the family with hope in the desperate days after the murder

Marina spoke of her family's struggle at the New York city museum on Fifth Avenue as part of a charity event for the Lulu & Leo Fund, a foundation established in honor of her murdered children.

The fund supports arts and educational programs for disadvantaged children, inspired in part by the artistic leanings of the Krim children.

And since the horrifying events of 2012, Nessie has now been given the chance to welcome a new sibling, after Marina and Kevin had another son, Felix, who is now around a year old.

The fundraiser, held Wednesday, featured performances by a youth choir supported by the Leo & Lulu Fund, as well as auctions for charity lots including tickets to the Stanley Cup, a Napa Valley vineyard tour, and a chance to have a character named after you in the upcoming Sharknado 3 film.

Worthy causes: The SingForHope choir, pictured, performed at the event on Wednesday

Many of the lots lots were tied to NBC shows - such as a set tour of Blacklist and a meeting with Today Show hos Matt Laure; fitting given Kevin Krim's job as an executive at the CNBC channel.

After the event, Kevin re-posted excited tweets from successful bidders, and performers from the SingForHope choir.

Meanwhile Ortega has been jailed over the killings, and awaits her trial, which has yet to be assigned a date.
