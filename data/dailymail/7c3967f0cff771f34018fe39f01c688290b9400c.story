Alleged kidnapper of Abigail Hernandez, Nathaniel Kibby, appeared in court today where prosecutors told the court that his shipping container had three sections - but would not describe the third area.

Kibby was charged last month with snatching the teenager as she walked home from high school in October. Abigail, 15, returned home last month.

The 34-year-old former machinist kept his head down as he entered court in Ossipee, New Hampshire today in handcuffs, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and carrying a stamp addressed letter in his top pocket.

Kibby's defense attorney sparred with prosecutors over evidence at the accused's trailer park home and shipping container. During arguments, Assistant Attorney General Jane Young revealed  the container is in three sections with the middle part being the largest.

According to the Boston Globe, 'the court is aware of' the third part of the container but she would give no other details because the investigation is ongoing.

MailOnline revealed last week that the shipping container may have had three separate, sound-proofed rooms. One neighbor was even asked whether he thought Kibby could have dug a tunnel from his trailer to the container.

The resident, who did not want to be named, told MailOnline last week: ‘The FBI have been asking lots of different questions and they all seem to come back to the same couple of things. Have we ever seen him burning anything, or digging.

‘They asked me about digging and burying twice and they specifically asked whether he would have been able to dig a tunnel from the container to the trailer.

‘It seems very strange and makes you wonder what they think he was doing in there. I knew the guy and unfortunately I sometimes saw him on social occasions, but I tried to avoid him as much as possible. He was a strange man.

‘I know people who have been in that container and they say it was split into three rooms. He did a lot of work back there. It was sound proofed as far as I know.

‘I have heard he kept Abby in there for the whole winter. It would not surprise me. There is a lot of noise round here, with kids screaming and shouting, so it is possible no one would have heard anything, especially if it was sound proofed. He was always going back there. No one thought anything of it.'

Defense attorney Jesse Friedman asked on Wednesday for the judge to block the prosecution's attempt to remove Kibby's mobile home and a shipping container. 

In court papers filed on Tuesday, Mr Friedman argued he needs to keep all the evidence preserved because he has so little information on why his client was arrested. 

Mr Friedman is asking a judge to secure all evidence, including medical records from exams of Abigail, phone and text records, investigative notes and blood, saliva and other bodily substances. 

He wants the protection extended to evidence collected at Kibby's home in Gorham and the town house Abigail Hernandez shares with her mother in nearby Conway.

Kibby is charged with a felony count of kidnapping, which carries a sentence of up to seven years in prison if he's convicted. He's being held on $1 million cash bail.

At a hearing on Wednesday,prosecutors argued that it's impossible to safeguard the trailer and storage unit without posting a 24-hour guard at the site and that by securing them offsite they will be better preserved.

In court papers, state Attorney General Joseph Foster said leaving the home and storage unit where they are would attract the curious and possibly vandals. 

Assistant Attorney General Young described the level of interest in the Hernandez case as 'macabre', according to the Globe.

The state said it will make every effort to preserve the other items listed in the defense papers.

Abigail disappeared on October 9, and for nine months the only trace of her was a letter she wrote to her mother. 

She returned home on July 20 but the circumstances of her return are just as mysterious as those of her disappearance.

Police stand guard outside the trailer park home of Kibby in Gorham. Prosecutors have asked that the home be moved to a secure area because of the 'macabre' level of interest in the case
