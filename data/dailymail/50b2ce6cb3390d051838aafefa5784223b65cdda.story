A dangerous bulldog faces being put down after it terrorised local postmen who then refused to deliver to its owner's whole street - meaning dozens of families have been forced to walk miles to collect their post. 

The seven stone American bulldog, named Winston, was under threat of a death sentence in court today after his attacks sparked a health and safety enquiry.

His repeated attacks on postmen led to a ban on all postal deliveries to the whole of Worcester Street in Blackburn, Lancashire, which came into force in February this year.

Residents from the 60 homes affected have had to travel two miles to collect their mail from the Blackburn delivery office.

And one disabled neighbour, who feared he had cancer, missed an important letter from the hospital because it remained undelivered due to the ban.

Clive Fisher, 69, was waiting for a letter from Royal Blackburn Hospital oncology unit after being referred by his GP because he was exhibiting signs of cancer. 

He said: 'An appointment letter was left undelivered and at the sorting office for days because of that dog.

'There's only a short time to treat disorders like this and I know there's a lot of people on this road with illnesses or disabilities. 

'I'm disabled but I'm lucky I have a car. A lot of my neighbours don't, or are unable to drive.' 

One postman reported being bitten on the arm and had to kick the dog twice in the head to fend him off.

Another said Winston bounded 100 yards towards him before clamping his teeth around the mailbag.

He had to cower behind a tree and throw his one remaining letter to distract the animal before diving behind a gate and alerting a colleague to take cover.

Winston's owner Hayley Sandiford was ordered to keep her dog under control or face having him put down under a Contingent Destruction Order after one of the postmen told JPs at Blackburn magistrates' court of his ordeal and warned the dog would attack again.

Now the dog must remain muzzled and kept on a harness with two dog leads no more than six feet long whenever he is taken out for walks. He must also only be accompanied by a person over 16.

Miss Sandiford was also ordered to keep her home securely fenced and locked and must obtain third party insurance for the animal. 

The mother-of-two pleaded guilty to being the owner of a dog dangerously out of control and was handed a six month community order with a six month supervision requirement. 

She must pay prosecution costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £60 and attend dog behaviour sessions.

But after the case, Miss Sandiford insisted her dog is not dangerous but a 'softie'. 

She said: 'I'm already doing the things the court wants but as far I'm concerned my dog isn't dangerous and not the Devil Dog that some people seem to think he is. 

Winston is brilliant with my kids and he is just a softie. 

'Unfortunately he does have a thing about postmen but it is the mail they carry and not the postmen themselves.' 

She added: 'If I thought my dog was a danger to any kids or any other people I wouldn't be able to live with myself and I wouldn't put anybody's life at risk. 

'If I even had one per cent doubt in my mind that he would turn he would be gone no matter how much I love him. 

'Winston did jump up at the postman - but he is a very bouncy playful little thing and he forgets how big he is - although I accept it must have been scary for the postman.

'Anyone who knows my dog will say he doesn't have it in him to hurt anyone. As soon as I shouted 'Winston stop' and pulled him back he stopped straight away. 

It wasn't a vicious attack because if it was he would not have let go of the postman. People are going to be mad about the post but there is no reason why they shouldn't deliver the post now.'  

The court heard Winston bit an unnamed postmen on the arm whilst being taken for a walk by the owner's nine-year-old son in February this year.

Royal Mail found there was an 'unacceptable level of risk associated with deliveries' in Worcester Road, Blackburn (pictured) and a ban on all deliveries was put in force in February

The postman suffered a bite suffered a bite wound which broke the skin and he received medical treatment in hospital as a result. 

No action was initially taken against the animal, but on July 9 the 'thick set and stocky built' dog atrtacked postman Paul Warnock while he was on his round. 

Mr Warnock said: 'Straight away I was worried because it was quite a big dog/

'As soon as it spotted me it came running towards me fast, at speed. 

'Then it was showing it's teeth and growling at me. It was coming at me aggressively, I was frightened. I was backing off then all of a sudden it went for me it grabbed the bundle of mail. 

It was in the middle of the street because I was backing off so much.'

Mr Warnock ran behind a tree for cover and added: 'When I got behind the tree I saw a gate, I thought if I can get inside the gate it's safe. 

I was left with one letter. It was still going for me. I had one piece on mail, I threw it to take it's eye off me and ran behind the gate. It would have attacked me in the street.'

'When I got behind the gate the dog was roaming the street. I saw my colleague further up the street coming down, he heard the commotion. I shouted 'get back get back, dog lose on the street. '

His colleague took cover behind a gate and watched Miss Sandiford get hold of the dog. 

Mr Warnock said: 'I was more worried about the bundle of mail in the middle of the road, that's my job to look after it.

'We got in our van and just drove to safety two streets away because we were that frightened. I don't do around there anymore. 

The Dangerous Dogs Act was introduced in 1991 as a means of keeping vulnerable people and children safe from animals.

Prohibited breeds are so because they have been bred for their abilities to fight.

Banned dogs include the pit bull terrier, Japanese tosa, Dogo Argentino and Fila Braziliero and any other considered by the Secretary of State to have been bred for fighting.

Banned breeds cannot be kept, bred, sold or exchanged under the law. Anyone who owns a banned breed cannot take it out in public without a muzzle.

If a person commits an Dangerous Dogs related offence, they can be disqualified for dog ownership and be ordered to have the animal put down. 

I believe that dog should be removed from these premises. I think it will attack again, there's no doubt in my mind it will attack again.' 

Miss Sandiford's lawyer Gareth Price said that since the incident she had been making 'positive steps' to make sure that there was no repeat and was engaging with her landlords at Twin Valley Homes. 

He added that a dog expert had observed that the dog was 'properly trained' and had 'adequate training'. 

Passing sentence JP Jan Alcock said of the contingent destruction order: 'You must understand it is like a suspended sentence for the dog. 

'It is entirely your responsibility to keep the dog alive. If you break the conditions the police will take the dog and it will be destroyed so it is on your head.'

The Royal Mail confirmed a health and safety assessment had been carried out on Miss Sandiford's neighbourhood which highlighted an 'unacceptable level of risk associated with deliveries.'

A spokesman said 'Suspending deliveries is a last resort but we take the health and safety of our employees very seriously. We apologise to all affected customers.' 

Recent figures have said on average nine postmen a day are attacked by dogs - around 3,300 attacks a year.
