Patrick 74, was in intensive care after crashing his car when PC Philip Reese visited him at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital in June last year

A 74-year-old man who lay dying in intensive care after a car accident was threatened with prosecution by a policeman, an inquest was told.

PC Philip Reese was criticised by a coroner for carrying out an 'inappropriate interview' with the pensioner who was wearing an oxygen mask.

Patrick Harris from Cinferdord, Gloucestershire, died two days after the interview took place.

According to the deceased's family, the police officer was overheard going through a formal caution procedure before telling Mr Harris he could face prosecution for dangerous driving.

Mr Harris was being treated for injuries from a car crash in which his twin sister, Shirley Harris, was also involved.

The former police mechanic was allegedly left in tears after his conversation with PC Reese,  family spokesman, Robin Vick, told the inquest.

A patient in the bed next to the 74-year-old claimed she heard the police officer telling Mr Harris that his sister's life was hanging in the balance  as she was being treated at a different hospital.

Mr Vick said sent a letter of 
complaint to Gloucestershire Police's chief constable to alert him to 
the way in which Mr Harris had allegedly been treated.

The
complaint was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission 
but was then handed back to be investigated by the force’s own internal 
disciplinary department.

It is understood the officer was ‘given advice’ but there was no further action.

In evidence, PC Reese claimed the 
reason for the bedside interview was his concern the pensioner would be 
discharged and be allowed to drive again.

He said the conversation was carried out 'under caution' in order for a proper record to be kept of what was said.

Coroner David Dooley however asked: 'You had concerns that he might shortly be released and drive again? But 
what is the reality of a man with serious injuries including a broken 
arm and with a car which is written off driving again?'

'According to the protocol at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital did you get permission from senior medical staff to interview him?'

Shirley Harris, 74, was not well enough to attend the inquest in Gloucester. The siblings lived in a house their father built for over 50 years before Mr Harris's death

The
policeman said he had received permission from a nurse (who had asked a
doctor) to conduct the interview, but could not remember either 
person's name and had no record of the conversation. 

The
officer denied that he threatened Mr Harris with prosecution for 
dangerous driving but admitted that he told the pensioner his 
sister was ‘very poorly’ in Frenchay Hospital.

When Mr Dooley probed: 'Did you tell Mr Harris that it was all his fault, as was said by the woman in the next bed?' the officer said he hadn't.

The
family's representative, Mr Vick added: 'Did it not occur to you that 
Mr Harris was not in a fit state to be interviewed - he was wearing an 
oxygen mask and his arm was in traction' to which PC Reese responded by 
saying he had interviewed 'numerous' people in oxygen masks before.

A post mortem concluded that Mr Harris died as the result of a heart attack combined with his multiple injuries.

It was revealed the 74-year-old suffered a heart disease which had caused him to collapse in the months before the accident.

Cardiology consultant Professor 
George Hart told the inquest that the bedside interview conducted by PC 
Reese on June 21 last year could have contributed to his cardiac arrest.

'Severe stress can be
linked to an increased risk of a heart attack and as Mr Harris was 
already in a precarious medical state the interview could be sufficient 
to be associated with his heart attack,' said the professor.

'But
I must stress that this cannot be separated from his pre-existing poor 
medical condition and other factors and, in my view, it is more likely 
that he would have died in hospital anyway.'

Mr Harris suffered internal injuries,
broken ribs and a fractured arm in the accident which is thought to 
have happened after he 'blacked out' and veered off the road.

Miss Harris was left with wrist and rib fractures, and has undergone six operations since the crash.

Mr Dooley concluded proceedings by saying: 'I don’t think conducting an interview
under caution was appropriate and there is no record of permission 
being sought for the interview.'

'Nevertheless
the stress of the interview is the same as the other contributing 
factors in this case, such as Mr Harris’ injuries and his serious heart 
condition, and cannot be blamed for his death.

'The appropriate conclusion therefore is that Mr Harris died from natural causes.'

A spokesman for Gloucestershire Police said after the hearing: 'First and foremost our thoughts are with the family of Mr Harris for their loss.

'Following a complaint, an internal investigation was carried out by our Professional Standards Department. It resulted in words of advice to PC Reese around the issue of note taking and the case was closed with no further action.

'When investigating road traffic collisions in which people are killed or seriously injured, it is essential officers are able to quickly establish the factors involved to allow them to preserve or gather evidence and assess if there is any criminal responsibility.

'This is a key aspect of protecting the public and often means speaking to people who are being treated in hospital. We understand this can cause distress and our officers make every effort be sensitive to the circumstances.

'In this case the interview was authorised by PC Reese's supervisor, agreed by a nurse and was very brief.'
