Tony Abbott is less popular than Julia Gillard was in the days before she was dumped in favour of Kevin Rudd before last year's election.

The latest Newspoll, published by The Australian, shows that Mr Abbott's approval rating has dropped to 31 percent, lower than Ms Gillard's 34 percent approval rating last June.

Voters also reported the highest level of dissatisfaction with Mr Abbott since he was elected prime minister, with 62 percent dissatisfied with his performance.

Tony Abbott's approval rating is currently at 31 percent, lower than Julia Gillard's 34 percent approval rating in the days before she was ousted as leader last year

Bill Shorten has a ten-point lead on Tony Abbott as preferred prime minister, with 44 percent of voters saying he would be a better PM

Bill Shorten had a 10-point lead on Tony Abbott as preferred prime ministerm with 44 percentÂ  saying they would rather the Labor leader was in charge, compared to only 34 percent preferring Mr Abbott.

The poll also showed that if the election were held today Labor would win, with the ALP scoring 55 percent of the two-party-preferred vote, compared to 45 percent for the Coalition.

This is the fifth consecutive Newspoll that has put Labor ahead on the two-party-preferred vote, it is the same low result the Coalition scored in the first poll after the May budget. and the equal worst result for the Coalition in four years.

Do you think Tony Abbott is doing a good job as prime minister?

These results are almost a complete reverse of the election results from last September, when the Coalition received 53.5 percent of the two-party-preferred vote.

Bill Shorten has regained the 10-point lead as preferred prime minister that he had in the first poll after the budget was announced.

However his satisfaction rating, while unchanged at 34 percent since last month's poll, is down from his post-budget high of 42 percent.

Dissatisfaction with Shorten dropped four points from the poll last month and is now sitting at 41 percent, more than 20 points lower than Abbott's dissatisfaction rate of 62 percent.

Preference for the Greens and other independent parties increased significantly from the election last year, with 13 percent of people saying they would vote Greens and 15 percent saying they would vote for independent parties if the election were held today, compared to 8.7 percent and 12.4 percent at September's election respectively.
