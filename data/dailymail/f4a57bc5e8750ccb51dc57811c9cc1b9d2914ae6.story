Sir Michael Wilshaw said 'good' schools will receive more frequent check-ups to stop them from slipping back into mediocrity

The head of Ofsted yesterday demanded ‘slightly maverick’ head teachers who ‘aren’t afraid to ruffle feathers’ as part of a major clampdown on coasting schools.

Sir Michael Wilshaw insisted there was ‘no room for complacency’ amid ‘worrying signs’ that standards in secondary schools are ‘stagnating’.

He revealed that ‘good’ schools will receive shorter and more frequent check-ups in future as part of a major shake-up of inspections in England.

This will help ensure they don’t ‘slip back into an acceptance of mediocrity’.

Up to 60 per cent of England’s schools will undergo ‘light touch’ visits from inspectors every two to three years to stamp out potential coasting.

At present, these ‘good’ schools undergo full inspections every five to six years.

The proposals, to come into effect from next September, will be published by the education watchdog for consultation today.

The shake-up will also enable inspectors to spend more time helping drive up standards in under performing schools.

Sir Michael told the Norfolk Annual Head Teacher conference yesterday that the introduction of a ‘requires improvement’ grade to replace ‘satisfactory’ has had a ‘galvanising effect’ on schools.

He said: ‘Coasting schools now know that mediocre standards will no longer be tolerated.

‘But I am the first to recognise that Ofsted needs to move towards a more proportionate, risk-based model for inspection which focuses on those struggling institutions that need a greater level of scrutiny and intervention.

‘At the same time, we need to move to a new inspection model which keeps a more watchful eye on good schools so that they don’t slip back but continue to improve.

‘That is why, when we launch our consultation, I will be suggesting frequent but shorter inspections of good schools led by HMI, with a much greater emphasis on professional dialogue.’

Sir Michael insisted that if the country genuinely aspires to a ‘world-class’ label for education ‘then we simply cannot afford to take our foot off the gas’.

‘It’s imperative that we continue to up our game as a nation if we’re to have any chance of competing economically and, just as importantly, if we are going to build a more cohesive society,’ he said.

‘Firstly, we must ensure the improvements of recent years are maintained and that the system does not slip back into an acceptance of mediocrity. This is a key driver for the reforms will be will be consulting on this autumn.’

Sir Michael said the Government was ‘very much looking to ambitious, buccaneering, go-getting school leaders to make the running in school improvement in 2014’.

‘Leaders who show a scornful intolerance towards the type of mediocrity that still characterises too much of our education system - and which until recently was dressed up in the euphemism of ‘satisfactory’,’ he said.

Sir Michael added that scrapping the 'satisfactory' grading for schools, and replacing it with 'needing improvement' had a 'galvanising' effect on standards

‘It very much chimes with my own conviction that the future of education in this country depends on these energetic, dynamic, entrepreneurial, and perhaps slightly maverick leaders who thrive on competition and aren’t afraid to ruffle feathers.’

Meanwhile, Ofsted’s plans for future inspections are also likely to include proposals for more no-notice visits.

Last month it was announced that Ofsted inspectors had been sent to dozens of schools across England to conduct snap inspections under the watchdog’s existing powers, amid serious concerns about standards. Schools usually get half a day’s notice of an inspection.

But Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, yesterday warned that sweeping reform of Ofsted was needed.

He said: ‘Schools can no longer learn effectively from its (Ofsted’s) adversarial approach.

‘The current model of inspection has reached the end of its useful life and now holds the education system back.’

He added: ‘The current trend of no-notice inspections has to stop.

‘Head teachers have a right and a need to be present during inspection and a small amount of notice is required to make this possible.’
