Injuries: Mother-of-three Kate Stone, of Cambridge, thought she was going to die after the attack

An academic today revealed her miraculous survival - and how she has been scarred for life - after a stag impaled her throat with its antlers.

Kate Stone thought she would die after being gored in Lochailort in the Scottish Highlands, which saw doctors put her into an induced coma and perform two operations on her windpipe.

Medical experts said the 44-year-old University of Cambridge electronics researcher was lucky not to have been paralysed from the neck down.

Dr Stone said: ‘It's a miracle I survived - especially when you consider that if a car hits a stag, the car's usually a write-off. But I believe it was part of my path in life - and part of that path was that I survived. I suppose I could wallow in what's happened, feel sorry for myself and ask “Why me?”, but I don't see the point.'

Dr Stone was holidaying at the end of last year when a startled stag charged towards her. It knocked her over, impaling her throat.

She added: ‘I was never attacked. The stag got spooked, ran and I just happened to be in the way. I didn't feel any pain, but looked down and saw a lot of blood and I was gurgling and struggling to breathe. My initial thought was I was going to die - but on reflection it was probably more traumatic for my friends, watching and helpless, than it was for me.’

Within 40 minutes, she was off to hospital in Fort William. She was then airlifted to be treated by specialists at Southern General in Glasgow.

The antler had gone through Dr Stone’s airway, fractured her neck, smashed her throat, damaged the nerves to her vocal cords, carried on through her oesophagus and hit her spine.

But it stopped just short of her spinal cord, which was something of a miracle considering it almost severed a main artery, which would have caused Dr Stone to bleed to death.

A fraction deeper and there was a chance she would have been paralysed from the neck down. Doctors put Dr Stone into a coma and operated on her windpipe. She added: ‘I woke up a week later - but I wasn't myself until about a week after that.’

Dr Stone, who has three children, said that the worst thing was the mental experience rather than the physical recovery.

She
 added: ‘People think when you wake up from a coma, you go straight back
 to normal. But I had crazy hallucinations which carried on after I woke
 up. In fact, it took over a week for me to get sane again.’

Her
 vivid hallucinations morphed voices and sounds she could hear on the 
ward into characters and scenarios in her head and she became trapped in
 a world which blended the fictional with the real.

She
 added: ‘It was a very scary and dark time. Like a recurring bad dream. I
 was acting like a crazy person, trying to reach out to touch and talk 
to people who weren't there.

‘I
 felt like I was losing my mind - and my sister thought I was going 
nuts. All sorts of bizarre stuff was going on, from surgeons trying to 
replace my brain to Snoop Dogg hiding in the toilet.’

As the strong painkillers wore off, Dr Stone began to come round. But months later she still finds herself haunted by the bizarre 'trips'.

'It was a very scary and dark time. Like a recurring bad dream. I was acting like a crazy person, trying to reach out to touch and talk to people who weren't there'

‘I have flashbacks and nightmares,’ said Dr Stone, who spent much of her recovery at her sister Claire Bee's home in Dundee. ‘People think I made a miraculous recovery - and physically I did. But the mental scars will take a lot longer to heal.’

After her initial operations, Dr Stone had to learn to walk, talk, write and even eat again.

But it was a welcome challenge for the 
child of a continent-hopping engineer father, who spent her younger 
years ‘in the company of bears in Yosemite, with monkeys in the garden 
in Brunei or having picnics in the Oman desert’.

‘I faced it head on,’ she said. ‘When 
the doctors said they were transferring me to the ward, I was determined
 I'd walk out with my head held high, rather than be wheeled in a chair.

‘The first day, I needed three people to 
help me out of bed. I took two steps on the spot, then vomited. The 
following day, I walked the length of the ward. It took all my strength 
but I was determined.

'My initial thought was I was going to die - but on reflection it was probably more traumatic for my friends, watching and helpless, than it was for me'

Dr Stone on the incident itself

‘With my voice, I got vowel sounds back initially, then had to learn how to breathe when speaking. Even now my voice is still croaky. But every time something came back, it was like being given a gift.

‘It's only after losing the things you take for granted that you realise how lucky you are.’

Until just a few weeks ago, Dr Stoneneeded to be fed through a nasogastric tube, but the dedicated vegan is now back on solids. She has lost a stone, but claims she is back to her 'perfect weight'.

Last week, Dr Stone returned to living and working at her print company Novalia in Cambridge, which she continued to run from her hospital bed - holding conference calls on Skype.
