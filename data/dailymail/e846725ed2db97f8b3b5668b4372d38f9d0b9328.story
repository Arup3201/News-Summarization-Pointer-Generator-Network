Thousands of pages from the Sandy Hook school massacre were released today, revealing further details of gunman Adam Lanza's childhood.

Among the police photographs were images of used paper targets from shooting ranges, which the 20-year-old was said to have visited with his mother, as well as a birthday card from his dad offering to take him shooting.

In the brightly-colored birthday card 
from Lanza's father, Peter, a message read: 'Adam, Happy Birthday - Send
 me an email when you want to go hiking or shooting. Love, Dad.'

It also revealed the extent of Lanza's mental illness with several witnesses speaking of an early fascination with destruction and violence.

One teacher says his work was too violent to be shown to the rest of the class.

Other photos and files showed that police found a stock of knives at the home and instruction manuals for the guns.

It is known that Lanza shot dead his mother Nancy Lanza while she lay in bed before taking off on his rampage at the school.

The day before the shooting she had stayed two days at a New Hampshire hotel as part of an experiment in letting her son stay home alone and be independent.

She was shot four times in the head by her son the morning after she returned. The rifle used to kill her was found by police next to her bed.

The sound of gunfire was reported between 8am and 9am that Friday, but it was believed to have been from hunters.

Investigators reported that the windows of his second-floor room had been taped over with black trash bags.

Windows on a computer room on the same floor had also been covered over. Police found a hard drive in that room that was so badly damaged that forensic experts doubt they will ever be able to recover the information.

Spreadsheets about mass killings were 
also found, which listed information about each case, and police found 
handwritten notes listing the addresses of local gun shops.

A GPS taken from the Lanza home showed a number of trips made between the family's house and schools in the area, according to documents released last month.

On
 December 13, a trip was recorded to Sandy Hook, the area where the 
school was located, though it is not known who was driving or if they 
went by the school.

Lanza shot dead 20 first-graders and six educators with a semi-automatic 
rifle at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012, before shooting himself.

State police released their report 
totaling several thousand pages at 3pm on Friday, December 27, including text, crime 
scene photos, audio tapes of 911 calls and video tapes of the 
investigation.

The 
paperwork, photos and videos were heavily blacked out to protect the 
names of children and to withhold some of the more grisly details of the
 crimes.

The report 'has been 
redacted according to law'. Many photos, including 50 autopsy photos and 28 identification photos, have been blacked out.

The release of Friday's documents concludes the state police's criminal investigation into the tragedy.

Other photographs of the home Lanza shared with his mother show numerous rounds of ammunition, gun magazines, shot-up paper targets, gun cases, shooting earplugs and a gun safe with a rifle in it.

Personal items, including a card thanking Mrs Lanza for her time volunteering at the school were also documented.

She had spent time at the school between 1998 and 2012, including a period when Lanza was a pupil there.

'Lanza apparently felt that his mother loved the students more than him,' the report said.

Pictures believed to have been drawn by Lanza were also found in the family home.

Prosecutors issued a summary of the investigation last month that portrayed Lanza as obsessed with mass murders but the report concluded that Lanza's motives for the massacre might never be known.

Lanza 'was undoubtedly afflicted with mental health problems; yet despite a fascination with mass shootings and firearms, he displayed no aggressive or threatening tendencies', it said.

His mother had said during a lunch 
with friends just before the shooting that she never 'felt in any 
personal danger living with Adam'.

During
 the lunch she had said she was planning on leaving Newtown, and 
continuing to care for Lanza, perhaps in North Carolina or Washington 
state.

Books about Asperger syndrome, which Lanza had, were found in one of the bedrooms of the family home

Two weeks before the 
shooting however, Mrs Lanza had confessed to a friend that her son was 
becoming increasingly despondent and had was put 'over the edge' when 
their house lost power during Hurricane Sandy.

Another
 friend told investigators that Mrs Lanza texted him a few days before 
the shooting to say her son had bumped his head and they were 'dealing 
with blood'.

Books about 
dealing with autism were found at the family's home and a nurse who met 
Lanza four times in 2006 and 2007 had prescribed him anti-anxiety 
medication.

The nurse 
said in her police interview that Lanza had been diagnosed with 
obsessive compulsive disorder and was 'emotionally paralyzed', changing 
his socks 20 times a day.

Despite this his mother had stopped giving him the medication and failed to schedule follow up visits.

Among other disturbing elements of evidence to be revealed from a summary report last month, was the fact that in the fifth grade, Lanza wrote The Big Book of Granny, in which the main character has a gun in her cane and shoots people, and another character talks of liking to hurt people, especially children.

The book was among items seized from Lanza's home, but there was no indication he ever handed in the book at school.

One of Lanza's former teachers told investigators that when asked to do creative writing at school he would write disturbing accounts.

'Adam would write ten pages, obsessing over battles, destruction and war,' the teacher said, according to the report. His work was 'so graphic that it could not be shared.'

Lanza was also obsessed with the 1999 shooting at Columbine High in Colorado and other mass killings, the report said.

The report also said that in 2005, 
Lanza was diagnosed with Asperger's disorder - an autism-like condition 
that is not associated with violence - and that he lacked empathy for 
others and behaved strangely.

Nobody
 was allowed into his room, not even to clean, according to the report. 
It said Lanza also disliked birthdays, Christmas and holidays and did 
not like to have his hair cut.

He
 also wouldn't touch doorknobs, his food had to be arranged on the plate
 in a certain way, and he changed clothes often during the day.

He was a loner at school and was repelled by crowds and loud noises.
