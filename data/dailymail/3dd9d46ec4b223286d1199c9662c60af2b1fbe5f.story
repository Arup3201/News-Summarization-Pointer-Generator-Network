Downing Street has backed plans to decriminalise non-payment of the BBC licence fee - with the three main parties voting on the matter on Tuesday

The abolition of the BBC licence fee came a step closer yesterday when Downing Street backed plans to decriminalise non-payment.

All three main parties will vote on Tuesday to end the threat of prison sentences for fee dodgers.

More than 180,000 viewers – almost 3,500 a week – appeared in court in 2012 accused of watching TV without a licence. Most of them were fined and handed a criminal record. Every year around 70 people end up in jail.

Ministers are supporting an amendment to the Deregulation Bill that would withdraw the criminal sanctions when the BBC’s charter comes up for renewal in 2016.

A Labour source said the party was open to the idea as long as it did not hit the BBC’s £3.5billion annual income. ‘Nobody wants to see people going to prison for non-payment if they can’t afford the fee,’ a source said.

Downing Street’s announcement follows campaigning by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen. He wants civil penalties to replace the jail terms imposed for refusing to pay the £145.50 fee.

The amendment would delete references in the 2003 Communications Act to licence fee evaders being ‘guilty of an offence’. Instead those who refuse to pay will be ‘liable to a civil penalty’.

The amendment has been backed by more than 150 MPs including former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell, former Tory shadow home secretary David Davis and Labour former health secretary Frank Dobson.

Mr Bridgen’s amendments would give ministers powers to impose ‘civil monetary penalties’. Fines could be levied like parking tickets with offenders paying online rather than facing court.

Last night Mr Bridgen claimed decriminalisation heralded the beginning of the end for the licence fee.

‘This is a warning to the BBC that the future of the licence fee is now on the table,’ he said. ‘I expect decriminalisation will be in place by the end of 2016. The public and the Commons will no longer stand for it. Ultimately you will see the BBC having to adopt different mechanisms to collect money.’

Insiders say the BBC will be expected to charge overseas viewers more for watching iPlayer and to roll it out to other countries. It is currently only available in Western Europe. The BBC would also be expected to raise funds from its commercial arm.

The corporation has admitted that up to 2 per cent of households exploit a loophole that enables them to watch ‘catch-up’ programmes online for free. With 26.4million households in the UK, as many as 528,000 could be doing so.

Ministers will now launch a review of the penalties for non-payment of the TV licence, which will feed into negotiations with BBC bosses after the 2015 election.

Solicitor General Oliver Heald has signed a joint amendment with Mr Bridgen that will require Culture Secretary Maria Miller to carry out a review of the sanctions, lasting up to a year, within three months of the Deregulation Bill being passed.

The findings will be presented to the BBC Trust as well as both Houses of Parliament.

A Downing Street source said: ‘This would give us the power to be able to decriminalise non-payment after the election. There’s a quite compelling case.’

Both Lib Dem and Labour officials said they are expected to vote it through unopposed when the Bill reaches the final day of its committee stage on Tuesday.

A source close to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said: ‘We’ve come to a common view with the Conservatives to pass this.’

The BBC Trust said any change should be part of the charter renewal process.

A BBC spokesman said: 'These amendments make clear that the decriminalisation issue will be reviewed once the bill has past and no decisions will be taken until Charter review.'
