John Terry will be allowed to continue as England captain, despite being told that he must appear in court next year to answer a criminal charge of using racist language on the field.

To the fury of anti-racism campaigners, top officials at the Football Association stayed silent after the footballer was formally summonsed yesterday over an outburst against a black player during a Premier League clash.

The multi-millionaire defender – who denies any racial abuse – also continued to enjoy the backing of his club, Chelsea.

A spokesman for campaigning group Hope Not Hate said: ‘It seems 
incredible that John Terry can continue as England captain while this 
charge is hanging over him.

‘Most members of an organisation facing similar charges would find 
themselves suspended until the matter is resolved. He is not even facing
 a football-related matter – this is a serious criminal charge which has
 attracted a huge amount of attention.’

Terry learned at the end of a damp training session at Chelsea’s 
training ground near Cobham, Surrey, that he will be brought before a 
district judge and charged.

The order for Terry to appear before a district judge relates to a 
penalty box clash with QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in October. 
Prosecutors decided there was enough evidence, including TV images of 
the incident that were beamed around the world, to put him on trial.

He is accused of calling Ferdinand a ‘f****** black ****’ during the match at QPR’s Loftus Road stadium.

But afterwards he told Ferdinand, whose brother Rio plays alongside 
Terry for England, that the remarks had been taken out of context, 
insisting he actually said: ‘Oi, Anton, do you think I called you a  
black ****?’

Terry will first appear in court next February but the case is likely to
 drag on for up to six months as lawyers prepare for a trial. The cloud 
of suspicion will continue to hang over Terry during England’s next 
clash against Holland on February 29, and may even run into England’s 
preparations for next summer’s Euro 2012 tournament in Ukraine and 
Poland.

The maximum punishment Terry faces is a £2,500 fine, a sum he earns in 
just two hours and 38 minutes on his £160,000-a-week salary.

Last night, Terry, 31, said he was ‘disappointed’ with the decision and 
that he hoped to clear his name ‘as quickly as possible’.

He said: ‘I have never aimed a racist remark at anyone and count people from all races and creeds among my closest friends.

Allegations: John Terry captains England at Wembley last month as they played Sweden in a friendly, despite the racism claims hanging over him. England boss Fabio Capello said he is innocent until proven guilty

‘I will fight tooth and nail to prove my innocence. I have campaigned 
against racism and believe there is no place for it in society.’

England manager Fabio Capello has kept Terry as England captain despite 
the racism claims and said the defender should be presumed to be 
innocent until proven guilty.

Terry, a married father of two, has lost the captaincy once before,  in 
2010, after claims that he had an affair with the ex-girlfriend of his 
England team-mate Wayne Bridge, but regained it earlier  this year.

Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas said: ‘The only thing I  know is that I
 will be fully supportive of John Terry, whatever the outcome. He has my
 full support, he has the club’s full support. We know exactly his human
 values and personality. They are never in doubt.’

Terry will be charged with a racially aggravated public order charge, 
accusing him of causing someone ‘harassment, alarm or distress’ under 
the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.

The player was summonsed to appear at West London magistrates’ court on 
February 1. The move will ensure a huge media circus descends on the 
courthouse, which usually deals with drunks, driving offences and 
teenage tearaways.

Alison Saunders, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said the decision was
 made after ‘careful consideration of the evidence’ and was in the 
public interest.

The announcement came after Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was handed an 
eight-match ban by the Football Association for racially abusing 
Manchester United left-back Patrice Evra.

The FA last night declined to comment on the Terry case.
