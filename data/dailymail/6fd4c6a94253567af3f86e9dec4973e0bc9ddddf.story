Four Iraqi women have come forward to accuse Australian jihadists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar of kidnapping and enslaving them for two months.

The women, who belong to the religious Yazidi minority, told ABC's 7.30 they were taken from Iraq to Syria by force, and were among thousands of others who were targeted because of their beliefs. 

Sharrouf and Elomar became notorious after leaving Australia with their families to fight for Islamic State, actively detailing their violent efforts on social media.

Four Yazidi women have accused Australian jihadists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar of kidnapping and enslaving them for two months 

Sharrouf in particular has garnered widespread criticism for his posts, uploading a picture of his son holding a severed head and sub-machine gun to the internet. 

When Islamic State stormed northern Iraq in 2014, they targeted the Yazidis, an ancient Kurdish religious group which IS believes to be infidels.

Since 2014, reports of the kidnapping, rape, and forced marriage of Yazidi women has been widely circulated, but the testimonies have been almost impossible to corroborate. 

The four Yazidi women, who asked for their names to be changed out of fear of reprisals, identified their captors from mug shots presented to them by an ABC journalist. 

The women kidnapped by Sharrouf and Elomar are believed to have been held on the second floor of a building on Newbridge Road, on the outskirts of Raqqa, in Syria.

One of the women, Layla, who claims to have been taken captive said that Sharrouf, who was jailed in Australia for his involvement in a terror plot, threatened to sell the women if they cried.

'He threatened to sell us if we did. He said, 'Why are you sad? Forget about your home and family. This is your home and we are your family now,' she told 7.30.

'Forget about your gods, for good, because we have killed them all,' she said.

Sharrouf told the women that he had been beaten while in jail in Australia, and that when he got angry, he could kill someone because he had 'no mercy in [his] heart'. 

Another of the women, Ghazala, said that Sharrouf's five children, who are believed to be with him and his wife, participated in their terrifying ordeal.

'His children were treating us badly,' Ghazala said.

'They had knives and cell phones saying that they will take videos while cutting off our heads because we follow a different religion.'

Ten out of the thirteen members of Ghazala's family are still missing, along with tens of thousands of other Yazidi men, women and children.

Two of the women interviewed by 7.30 identified Mohamed Elomar, a former Sydney boxer, as their captor.

Elomar, 30, has previously been photographed with Sharrouf holding the severed heads of dead Iraqi soldiers, allegedly held Yazidi woman Layla captive.

Of Layla's family, 27 members are still missing, something which she said she can never forgive Elomar for.  

'When we asked them about the men, he said they were beheading them,' she told 7.30.

'There were no men alive. He would tell us this is your home, you have no other home, you have to do what we say,' she said.

The women claimed that Elomar would take girls for the night, beat them and sell them on. 

'At night he was taking a girl downstairs, and when the girl returned she’d tell us, ‘he told me you have to marry me or else I will sell you, and if you say anything to my wife I will sell you or kill you’,' said one of the women.

The women also claim that Sharrouf demanded that the women marry him, despite his Australian marriage to the mother of his five children.

The women said that they hoped the Australian government would avenge their trauma if the two men were ever taken captive.

'If those terrorists are ever caught, they must make sure they never escape. I want them to punish those terrorists and torture them,' said one of the women. 

At least two other Australians have been identified as Islamic State fighters who allegedly took Yazidi women captive.
