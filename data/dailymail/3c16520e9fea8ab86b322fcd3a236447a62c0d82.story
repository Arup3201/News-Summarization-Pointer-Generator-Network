A math teacher who raped her students has made a plea deal  that could get her a shorter time behind bars.

Meredith Powell, 24, was arrested in February after a series of male students came forward accusing her of sending inappropriate texts and engaging in sexual activity.

She then told police she had performed sex acts with multiple students, one as young as 15 years old, inside her locked classroom, as well as sending them sexualized pictures of herself.

Plea deal: Meredith Powell, 24, was arrested in February after students came forward accusing her of sending inappropriate texts and engaging in sexual activity

Yesterday Lincoln High School teacher from Tacoma, Washington, admitted two counts of rape of a child in the third degree and one count of communication with a minor for immoral purposes.

Tacoma Schools representatives said they were grateful she finally admitted to her wrongdoing that ultimately affected students and her colleagues.

Tacoma Schools General Counsel Shannon McMinimee said: 'Ms Powell was well-liked by staff and students and they were devastated that she had violated the trust that they had placed with her.'

Powell's attorney Wayne Fricke told King5.com his client has shown remorse over what happened.

'She was going through a difficult time in her personal life and obviously made a lot of bad choices, regrettable choices,' said Fricke.

A fourth count of sexual misconduct of a minor was dismissed. Powell was ordered to be held without bail until sentencing scheduled on August 29.

She could face up to five years in jail, but her attorney says that prosecutors will recommend six months of jail time with three years of treatment.

Tacoma police initially began investigating Powell after learning that she wrote a letter to one of the boy’s girlfriends apologizing for 'promiscuous' and 'unprofessional' drunken text messages she exchanged with one of the boys.

Powell was arrested and placed on unpaid leave.

Police said Powell began a relationship with the three students - who are between the ages of 15 and sixteen - in January.

Powell told police the relationships began when she was intoxicated and sent a text to the students, saying they were 'hot', following back-and-forth communication.

Powell said she apologized to the students the next morning, and also sent a letter to one of the defendant’s girlfriends in an attempt to explain what happened.

After interviewing the victims, who said they had sexual contact with Powell behind a lock door in her classroom, police again interviewed Powell.

She then admitted to engaging in a sex act with one of the students and other sex acts with another at different times in late January.

Powell also sent at least one of the victims a Snapchat photo of her in the bathtub.

She told police she knew her actions were wrong, and that she would apologize to the student’s parents if she could.

Powell was hired by the Tacoma Public School district in September 2012 and was described as an excellent teacher and family-oriented.
