The devastated girlfriend of Real World star Ryan Knight, who was found dead on Thursday, has opened up about her grief via social media.

Makenzie Jauer, a 21-year-old student originally from Texas, wrote a message on Instagram, pouring her heart out.

TMZ report that 29-year-old Knight - who appeared in MTV's The Real World: New Orleans - died following a night out partying with friends on Wednesday.

Happy memories: Seen here in a snap posted four months ago with the message: 'This was such a fun day. I would do anything to be back there right now'

A close friend reportedly told the site that he was found dead by his friends on Thursday morning.

TMZ also report that several close friends of Knight claim he had taken some pills but did not specify what kind, while another friend claims he had 'choked on his own vomit'.

The website claims that no cause of death was found following an autopsy on Friday morning, and therefore will not be determined until the toxicology results come in.

TMZ alleges that Knight's father said the late star had stomach pains in the two days before his death, but that police found no clear signs of injury.

'Me and my boyfriend': Seen her just one month ago

On Thursday, his girlfriend posted a heartbreaking message, accompanied by some photos of them pulling goofy faces to the camera.

She wrote: 'I love you Ryan Knight. I am heartbroken, confused, hurt and most of all mad. The pain I am feeling now will never go away. 

'You mean more to me than you will ever know & I never thought that I would spend a day without you. Every second with you was full of love and laughter. You were the brightest light in every room.'

She went on: 'You taught me not to care about what other people think and you made me understand that being myself was okay. Thank you for being inappropriate at the worst of times and making me laugh until I cried.  

Young love: Makenzie uploaded this snap five months ago, noting that she had just picked him up from the airport

Twitter tributes: Knight's MTV co-stars took to social media to pay their respects

'Thank you for loving me unconditionally even though I snored and drooled on you in my sleep. You had the sweetest soul and I will never forget that. I always called you "my sweet angel" and now you truly are. Love you forever, MEK.' 

Other co-stars from The Real World also took to social media to pay their respects, including his ex-girlfriend Jemmye Carroll who thanked her followers for their kind words.

She added: 'Words will never be enough to justify the connection we shared and the pain I will forever feel. RIP.' 

Worryingly, Knight's last tweet on Wednesday was simply a message that read: 'You used to mean a lot.'

Tragedy: Knight - pictured here in September 2013 in New York - had reportedly taken some pills just hours before his death and chocked on his own vomit, according to friends

The news comes just weeks after fellow Real World Star Diem Brown passed away after a long battle with cancer aged 32. 

Knight recently changed his Twitter profile picture to a snap of himself and Diem. 

The pair did not star together on MTV's The Real World, however, Knight did appear on The Challenge alongside Diem.

Following The Challenge, Diem did make a name for herself as an entertainment reporter after and their paths crossed on the reality television circuit.

He was known as a bit of a villain on the reality show, and Knight himself jokingly put his Twitter bio as: 'Sooooo I'm the a**hole'.
