The father of a young British backpacker who died after drinking poisonous gin has flown around the world in a bid to catch the people who sold her the lethal substance.

Brenton Emmons, 47, has travelled more than 8,000 miles to Indonesia after his daughter, Cheznye, tragically died there in April.

Mr Emmons, from Great Wakering, Essex, is determined to bring those responsible for her death to justice. 

Cheznye Emmons, 23, was travelling across Indonesia with her boyfriend, Joe Cook (right) when she died after drinking methanol which had been labelled as gin

Brenton Emmons (right) and Boo Beckett travelled to Indonesia earlier this summer in a bid to catch shopkeepers who are still selling methanol laced alcohol which killed Mr Emmons's daughter, Cheznye

A statement on Mr Emmons's Facebook page on July 12 read: 'Going back to shop that the gin was bought from to take more photos, can't say to  much at the moment, but my feelings are all over the place at this point in time.'

'I've had hardly no sleep for a couple of nights now. I can't stop thinking my little girl and just how far the shop is too the hospital it must of been f****ng horrific.'

'This is breaking my heart but I'm just hoping we can get some justice, just for peace of mind if not anything else. We are still waiting on police reports on raids done first day we got here.'

The raids Mr Emmons refers to took place after he alerted authorities to a local shop in Bukit Lawang where he bought counterfeit whisky.

He also purchased two bottles of gin during his trip which were brought back to the UK for analysis.

Tests revealed a staggeringly high amount of methanol in the drink - two 25ml shots could be enough to blind someone, and four could potentially kill.

Brenton Emmons has returned to the popular tourist spot in south Sumatra with friend, Boo Beckett, in a bid to shut down shops selling illegal alcohol

Mr Emmons returned to the popular tourist spot in southern Sumatra with his friend, Boo Beckett, in July after launching a campaign in the UK against methanol poisoning.

CHEZ - Save a Life Campaign aims to 
raise awareness about methanol poisoning abroad and in the UK so that 
others won't have to endure the same heartbreak the Emmons family.

The campaign encourages travellers to 'stick to beer' when drinking abroad.

A
statement from the campaign's Facebook page says its 'mission' is to 
spread 'very simple' information 'into the NHS system, onto the streets 
and into our heads'.

It
continues: 'nobody deserves to be hurt or killed for something that 
could so simply be stopped. Cheznye was stolen from us whilst travelling
in Indonesia on her dream trip. She drunk (sic) gin from a sealed 
bottle that had been laced with methanol.'

'Our family wish to stop anyone else suffering a tragic loss like ours.'

Beautician, Cheznye had been travelling across Indonesia with her 
boyfriend, Joe Cook when the couple arrived in Bukit Lawang after visiting an orangutan sanctuary.

The pair fell ill after drinking from a bottle labelled Mansion House Gin at a full moon party.

Cheznye was taken to hospital after suffering loss of sight and seizures. She was kept there for five days until her parents, Brenton and Pamela Emmons, were told there was no more doctors could do for her

Cheznye woke up the following day unable 
to see and was taken on a five hour journey through the jungle to 
hospital, where she was treated for blindness, kidney failure and 
seizures.

Mr Cook, 21,survived the methanol poisoning but was forced to make the call to Cheznye's parents after she showed no signs of recovery.

She spent five days in hospital before doctors told Mr Emmons and Cheznye's mother, Pamela who had flown to the area, there was nothing else they could do. They were left no choice but to turn off the medical machine that was keeping their daughter alive.

Dream trip: Cheznye and boyfriend, Joe Cook, had been travelling across Indonesia on what Mr Emmons described as her 'dream trip' before drinking the lethal alcohol

Beautician Cheznye and her boyfriend, Joe Cook, both drank from the bottle which they had purchased in a local store. Mr Cook survived the alcohol poisoning in April

Mr Emmons is determined to spread the word about the dangers of alcohol poisoning.

He told The Sun newspaper: 'I just want to get the message out to other parents and travellers - they need to know how devastating and dangerous this is.

'I don't want another dad to feel the way I do.'

High taxes on recognised brands of wine, beer and spirits in Indonesia have prompted shop owners to mix the drinks with a locally brewed substance called arak.

Some, like in Cheznye's tragic case, are replacing drinks with methanol which is colourless to try and keep costs down. 

Methanol, which is also called methyl
alcohol, is used in numerous industrial applications, including the 
production of formaldehyde, acetic acid and as a fuel component.
