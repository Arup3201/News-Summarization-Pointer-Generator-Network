A family's Christmas presents arrived six weeks late after bungling postmen sent their gifts to Cambodia instead of Cambridge.

The battered cardboard parcel arrived at the Cary family's home last Saturday from friends in Paris - after it went on a 12,000 mile round trip from the South East Asian country.

It was only after the box arrived with a sticker saying 'missent to Cambodia' that they realised the French word for the country is Cambodge and the address had been misread.

When the parcel arrived last Saturday it had a stamp on it saying it had been 'missent to Cambodia' - more than 6,000 miles away

The box, which contained three books for Joe, 14, Sam, 10 and Anna, five, is estimated to have cost ParcelForce around £120 to send and arrived 50 days late.

Teenager Joe, who was delighted with his gift despite the delay, said: 'It must have stopped off in a lot of countries, because there's no direct route to Cambodia.

'They do live up to their "Worldwide delivery" slogan.

'It was a bit of a shock when we got a very battered parcel from the depot. It was really nice to receive.

The parcel travelled 6,142 miles (9884km) back from Cambodia to Cambridge after the address was misread

'I think the sheer novelty of them having gone to Cambodia and back takes the sentimental value up.'

The Paris-based friends who sent the parcel contacted the family in early January to see if the presents had been received and everyone assumed they had been lost in the post.

The books were Lamentation by C J Sansom for Joe, a Terry Pratchett novel for Sam and a picture book for Anna.
