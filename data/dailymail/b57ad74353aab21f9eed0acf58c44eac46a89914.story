MY LIFE IN HOUSES by Margaret Forster (Chatto & Windus £14.99)

To me, the description ‘a homemaker’ is a great compliment, but I’ve often wondered whether we do ‘make’ our homes, or whether they weave their own magic around our lives, slowly creating us in their own image.

It’s an exercise in give and take: a working partnership with bricks and mortar — far more profound than the colours of paint or cushions.

Novelist and biographer Forster certainly believes this. She begins her memoir by quoting Leonard Woolf: ‘Looking back on my life, I tend to see it divided into sections which are determined by the houses in which I have lived, not by school, university, work, marriage, death, division or war.’

‘Paul came first, with Jane Asher, but for tea, not dinner . . . next came George and Pattie, but for an evening meal'

Like Woolf, Forster believes your home determines every aspect of your life. Because of that, she tells her life story in terms of the roofs she has known — an interesting device, which enables her to withhold as many secrets as an ancient building in a ghost story.

This is not an emotional memoir, since her (well-known) husband and children scarcely have walk-on parts. The emotional punch comes at the end — all the more powerful because of the reticence that has gone before.

For this celebrated writer is facing her own death from cancer. The house she loves is now a refuge; it evokes a happy, creative past, but cannot shelter her from an inevitably sad future.

Forster’s trajectory typifies the social mobility that, in the post-war period, helped to rebuild Britain and make it great.

Good parents, an excellent grammar-school education, generous university grants, hard work and talent took her from a modest council house to a Georgian terrace in London, bought for a song 50 years ago, but now worth a fortune.

£1,772 - Average spent per household per year on home improvements 

Forster was born in 1938, ‘in the front bedroom of a house in Orton Road, a house on the outer edge of Raffles’, a council estate in Carlisle designed to provide homes for the ‘lucky’ deserving poor, who were still not quite worthy of indoor lavatories. (Many years later, she revisits this house, only to find it trashed by the undeserving poor: a bleak, dispiriting lesson in social change).

Little Margaret quickly realised her home wasn’t as good as some of those she visited. She fantasised about views prettier than the one she had. The family’s move to a better council house (with an indoor loo) met with her approval as did the new fireplace funded by her grandfather: ‘I was as admiring as everyone else, failing to see how cheap and ugly it was.’

We are in the Fifties now, and Forster describes herself as a ‘swot’ — a lower-middle-class girl who loves studying in the ‘best’ front room and is destined for a scholarship to Somerville College, Oxford University.

As a young woman Margaret quickly realised her home wasn’t as good as some of those she visited.

However, the unsociable student doesn’t really like living in college (which sounds like inverted snobbery), so moves to lodgings in Winchester Road — the pretty house she leaves in 1960 to marry her sixth-form sweetheart, Hunter Davies.

They rent a flat in London’s Hampstead and begin a life of extraordinarily prolific writing, with Forster producing a novel every year and Davies landing the first (and only) authorised biography of The Beatles, and a stellar career in journalism.

There are lovely tales of landlords, landladies and fellow lodgers in an account that sometimes reads like one of Forster’s well-loved novels: full of sharp observation and gentle wit.

In 1963, Forster and Davies obtained a £3,600, 20-year mortgage on a smelly, dark, ramshackle house — complete with a sitting tenant — in Kentish Town.

Gradually, it becomes the Home of Homes, although Hunter and Margaret flit to Portugal (for tax reasons) for a while, and buy in Cumbria, too — near their Carlisle families. Their London home witnesses the births of three children, as well as the couple’s increasing success.

Movies are made of their books and the house is visited by The Beatles (minus John): ‘Paul came first, with Jane Asher, but for tea, not dinner . . . next came George and Pattie, but for an evening meal. George was intent on philosophical discussion, and not much interested in the food . . . I made the same [aubergine dish] for Ringo and Maureen, but it turned out they were the sort of vegetarians who didn’t like vegetables other than potatoes.’

S ome may wish there were more anecdotes like that in this book.

But Forster seems most happy when enjoying the isolation of her beloved Lake District house (where she and Davies spend a good deal of the year), or when her London door has closed and she can walk up to her beloved writing room.

Although home is a refuge for most people, for Forster, it became the more so when she was first diagnosed with cancer at the age of 36. A mastectomy followed, then another in 1978.

The idea of the human body as a home is simply, but beautifully, evoked: ‘It struck me that if, as many claim, the body is merely a house for the spirit and the mind, then its owner has to keep up constant surveillance.’

Now that her cancer has metastasised and she knows she is ‘lucky to be still alive’, home provides calm and consolation, making her feel ‘safe’ in her ‘nest’.

Believing (as I firmly do) in the spirit of a place, I feel sure that this London home, with its cheerful yellow door, will forever contain the spirit of a remarkable woman, imprinted upon the walls she loves so much.
