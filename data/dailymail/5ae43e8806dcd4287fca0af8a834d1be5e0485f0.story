The RAF has carried out unmanned drone missions against the Taliban from British soil for the first time.

In an escalation of the war in Afghanistan, raids on extremists were flown by 13 Squadron, operating out of RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire.

The hi-tech Reaper drones are primarily used to gather intelligence on enemy activity on the ground, but they also carry 500lb bombs and Hellfire missiles for precision strikes on insurgents.

Controversy: RAF crews controlling armed Reaper drones in Afghanistan are doing so from British soil for the first time, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed

Until this week, RAF crews who control armed drones in Afghanistan have been operating from the Creech Air Force Base in Nevada.

An MoD spokesman said they had been carrying out missions including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, but would not comment on exactly what individual missions had been flown in the past week by drones piloted from the UK.

The pilots in Lincolnshire are operating with British and American colleagues still based in Nevada - but having drone operators in a different time zone makes it easier to coordinate shift patterns and conduct 24 hour operations.

The UK currently has five Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles but Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed in 2010 that the fleet of Reaper aircraft would expand.

The Reaper is the more powerful version of the lethal Predator, a 27ft long drone armed with Hellfire missiles and equipped with an infrared camera capable of identifying a human on the ground from 10,000ft in the air.

Last year the Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced that the UK was doubling the number of armed RAF drones in Afghanistan to 10. Delivery of the new aircraft is expected this summer.

The move is controversial since American drone strikes are blamed for killing innocent civilians.

The Ministry of Defence will only confirm one incident of civilian casualties involving British aircraft, when innocent people were killed by the blast of a missile that also killed two insurgents.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘13 Squadron have commenced supporting ISAF and Afghan ground troops in Afghanistan with armed intelligence and surveillance missions, which are remotely piloted from RAF Waddington.’

Anti-war protestors are set to gather outside the base today to call for a ban on the 'killer' drones, claiming the Government is using them to 'fight wars behind our backs'.

Members of the Stop The War Coalition, CND, the Drone Campaign Network and War on Want marched to RAF Waddington from Lincoln today to protest against the drones.

The organisers of the protest march and rally are calling on the Government to abandon the use of drones, claiming they make it easier for politicians to launch military interventions, and have increased civilian casualties.

Around 400 demonstrators took part today's March to the base, which assumed control of British drone missions in Afghanistan earlier this week.

The protesters cheered calls for the international community to emulate action taken against cluster munitions by outlawing armed drones.

'Ground the drones': Protestors said the use of the drones raised serious moral, ethical and legal questions

Chris Cole, a co-ordinator of the 
Drone Campaign Network, said the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) 
to wage war raised numerous legal, ethical and moral issues.

Speaking near Waddington's perimeter 
fence, Mr Cole said: 'This is the new home of drone warfare in the UK 
and there are questions about the growing use of these armed, unmanned 
systems.

'Because of their remote nature, 
there is no risk to any of our forces and that makes it easier to launch
weapons and makes it much easier for politicians to get involved in 
warfare,' he added.

Commenting ahead of the protest, War on Want senior campaigns officer Rafeef Ziadah said: 'Drones, controlled far away from conflict zones, ease politicians' decisions to launch military strikes and order extrajudicial assassinations, without democratic oversight or accountability to the public.

'Now is the time to ban killer drones - before it is too late.'

Chris Nineham, vice-chairman of the Stop the War Coalition, claimed drones were being used to continue the 'deeply unpopular War on Terror' with no public scrutiny.

Calling for armed drones to be banned, Mr Nineham said: 'They're using them to fight wars behind our backs.'

The Ministry of Defence has defended its use of drones in Afghanistan, which it says have saved the lives of countless military personnel and civilians.

An MoD spokesman said: 'UK Reaper aircraft are piloted by highly trained professional military pilots who adhere strictly to the same laws of armed conflict and are bound by the same clearly defined rules of engagement which apply to traditionally manned RAF aircraft.'

Lincolnshire Police held talks with the organisers of the protest to minimise disruption to the local community.

The route of the march from South Common along the A15 to the peace camp site opposite RAF Waddington saw the road closed in phases to limit inconvenience to motorists.

Its new role in the war on terror is not the first time RAF Waddington has been at the heart of Britain's fight against foreign enemies.

Squadrons flew out from RAF Waddington on the first day of the Second World War, and more than 40 years later the base would provide the Vulcan aircraft that bombed Port Stanley during the Falklands conflict.

Today, RAF personnel based at Waddington are controlling unmanned drones in the skies above Afghanistan in a bid to gather intelligence on enemy insurgents.

Over the decades the rural base has housed aircraft that played a crucial role in British military operations; from the Bristol Blenheim to the V-bomber nuclear strike force.

RAF Waddington first opened in November 1916 as a flying training station, teaching hundreds of British and U.S. Army pilots to fly in a wide range of aircraft.

Four years later the station was designated for care and maintenance, until a major RAF expansion began in 1934. That expansion saw the construction of some hangars which remain in use to this day.

In March 1937 Waddington was re-opened as a bomber base, and became the home of squadrons flying the light bomber aircraft the Bristol Blenheim, which was later replaced by twin-engine Handley Page Hampden bombers.

In 1939 both Waddington squadrons; 44 and 50, were in action on the first day of World War II, attempting to bomb the German Navy at Keil.

During the Battle of Britain, Waddington's Hampden aircraft bombed German invasion barges anchored in English Channel ports.

The Hampdens were eventually replaced by Avro Manchesters, before the superior Avro Lancasters entered RAF service for the first time with 44 Squadron at Waddington in 1941.

It was with this unit that Squadron leader John Nettleton earned the Victoria Cross in June 1942, after heading up an attack on a German U-boat engine factory.

Waddington saw further modernisation in 1943 with the introduction of concrete runways, after which two Royal Australian Air Force Lancaster squadrons took up residence at the base.

The final WWII raid from Waddington - which targeted an oil refinery at Tonsberg in Norway - took place in April 1945, just months before the war came to an end.

In the years that followed Waddington hosted a range of Lancaster and Avro Lincoln squadrons, before being put into maintenance once again in 1953 to prepare the base for the V-bomber - the aircraft that comprised the UK's strategic nuclear strike force during the '50s and '60s.

The V-bomber class included the famous Vulcan - the RAF's jet-powered delta wing aircraft.

By 1961 Waddington housed three squadrons of Vulcans, and the aircraft would remain a fixture at the base until March 1984, its planned retirement having been postponed as a result of the Falklands conflict.

Once again the Lincoln base was at the heart of the UK's military strategy; providing the Vulcans that bombed Port Stanley and also those hastily modified for air-to-air refuelling duties.
