Two pranksters spent three days preparing a welcome home gift for their flatmate by wrapping his entire bedroom in brown paper.

The friends used 150 metres of paper and eight rolls of sellotape to wrap everything from the bed and wardrobes to books and lamps.

Stunned Steve Berryman, 28, returned home from a skiiing holiday in France to find all his belongings - even his ukulele - had been wrapped up.

And... it's a wrap: The two pranksters spent three days preparing the welcome home gift for their flatmate

His brother Tim, 26, and fellow flatmate Tim Sutton, 27, carried out the makeover as a farewell prank before Steve leaves the UK for a job in America.

'I was shocked to say the least,' said Mr Berryman. 'They had pinned a card to my door saying, "Congratulations on your new job - we've given your room a makeover".

'When I walked in, I couldn't believe it. I didn't know where anything was. I've unwrapped the essentials - my bed and my computer, but everything else is still the way it was.

'If I want a book, it's pot luck which one I get. But it's nice to be able to use the room as a giant notepad. Plus, it looks quite nice.

'The tidying job was excellent. My room's never been so clean before.'

Mr Berryman, a Linux systems administrator, is moving out of their shared flat in London later this year and moving to San Francisco.

His two flatmates also filled his room with 320 balloons before he returned from the Meribel ski resort in the French Alps.

They filmed the entire prank on a time lapse and posted the video on YouTube.

Mr Berryman's brother Tim said: 'It was a labour of love. It was worth it just to see the look on his face.

'His room was pretty disgraceful and dirty and has been for a long time so we thought we would give him a gift.

'It took us three days, 150 metres of paper and eight rolls of sellotape to wrap the whole thing.

'We found over £100 in loose change and wrapped all that too. The hardest part was wrapping the ukulele though. It was just so fiddly.'
