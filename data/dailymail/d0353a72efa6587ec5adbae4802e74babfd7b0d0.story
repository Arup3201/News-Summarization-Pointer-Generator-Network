England's women's international against Germany at Wembley on November 23 has attracted a record crowd of 55,000.

The game marks the first time that the side has played at the stadium since it was reopened in 2007, and the number of tickets sold outstrips the men's side's friendly win over Norway in September by almost 15,000.

And the FA believe many more could have been sold for the match later this month were it not for planned engineering works hindering travel access on local London Underground lines.

'To have achieved ticket sales of 55,000 shows just how big an audience there is for women's football and what a landmark occasion it will be for the women's game,' declared the FA on their official website.

English football's governing body had only been expecting around 30,000 tickets to be sold for the match.

The clash continues Mark Sampson's sides build-up to next year's World Cup in Canada, a tournament that Germany have won twice previously in 2003 and 2007.
