The desk where author Bram Stoker created his immortal 1897 novel Dracula is going up for auction next month after having been restored and turned into a work of art.

California company Profiles in History will handle the sale, which will take place on December 15 and 16.

The remarkable piece of furniture has had a long history, which, over the past century, has left it battered, with missing drawers and legs sawn short.

The Irish-born Stoker, who died in 1912, initially gave the desk to his friend J.S.R. Phillips. The famous writer often stayed with Phillips at his home in the UK.

The current owner commissioned British-based furniture maker and designer Mark Brazier-Jones to preserve the desk, but also make it a stand-alone art piece, the auction house said.

Brazier-Jones said in a statement that he wanted to preserve the desk's scars and textures, but also pay homage to the man who introduced the vampire Count Dracula to today's pop culture.

His improvements include embroidered imagery ‘appropriate to the great man's inspirations and imagining’, including bats, a savage hound reminiscent of Dracula’s arrival in Whitby Abbey, and scrolling rose thorns and buds.

‘I visualize Stoker sat pen to paper contemplating a moonlit rose garden, breathless milk white cleavage and blood soaked lace,’ Brazier-Jones wrote, according to the East Valley Tribune.

The desk’s new fixtures have all been created in bronze and burnished steel, while the drawers have been lined with blood-red velvet.

Brazier-Jones also outfitted with leather two secret compartments which will only be revealed to the new owner of the desk.

Another hidden chest within the desk has been created in bronze and carved with a rose bas-relief.

The auction house expects the desk, along with a matching baroque candelabra designed and crafted by Brazier-Jones, to sell for somewhere between $60,000 and $80,000.

Abraham (Bram) Stoker was born November 8, 1847 in Dublin, Ireland, to a family of a civil servant and a charity worker.

As a child, Stoker was sickly and spent a lot of time in bed listening to his mother’s horror stories.

In 1864, Stoker entered Trinity College Dublin. While attending college he began working as an Irish civil servant.

In 1876 he became friends with actor Henry Irving, and soon after, Stoker met an aspiring actress named Florence Balcombe, whom he later married.

His first book The Duties of Clerks of Petty Sessions in Ireland though written while he was still in Dublin, was published in 1879.

Dracula (above left) was Bram Stoker's fifth and by far his most famous novel. It was first published in the UK in 1897.

The classic Gothic novel follows the vampire Count Dracula on his journey from his native Transylvania, Romania, to England, where he is finally slain by a small group of men and women led by Professor Abraham Van Helsing.

The character of the bloodthirsty nobleman was inspired by Vlad III, a 15th century Wallachian prince known for his excessive cruelty which has earned him the nickname Vlad the Impaler (above right).

Although best known for Dracula, Stoker wrote eighteen books before his death in 1912. He died of exhaustion at the age of 64.
