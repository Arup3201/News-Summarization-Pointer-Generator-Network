Prices at petrol pumps across the U.S. are rising so quickly that television reporters are struggling to keep up.

Footage of ABC News' Cecilia Vega reporting from a California forecourt has gone viral after each of the three grades of fuel rose 10 cents before viewers' eyes.

'It's almost too unbelievable to believe,' she said during her live report for Diane Sawyer's World News Tonight.

Staggering: Footage of ABC News' Cecilia Vega reporting from a California forecourt has gone viral after each of the three grades of fuel rose 10 cents before viewers eyes

Fast paced: In the blink of an eye, the prices rose by another 10 cents each

She added: 'Just while we were on the air during those two minutes of that story, the gas prices here at this station went up by 10 cents.

'It was $4.99. Now, it’s $5.09 for a gallon of regular gas here at this station in downtown Los Angeles.'

Some sceptics believe the extraordinary rise in the cost came because of a deal between the TV crew and the station owner.

They agreed to rise the price at that time, they claim, to further highlight the problem of spiralling fuel costs. But that has been denied by ABC News.

The real-time rise came at the start of a live report into the escalating cost of fuel in the U.S.

The station sign, at the beginning of the video, clearly showed fuel prices stood at $4.99 a gallon for regular, $5.09 a gallon for plus and $5.19 a gallon for super premium.

Claims: ABC News has denied speculation it asked the station's owners to change the prices when they were live on air

But as Vega spoke to the camera, the sign in the background can be clearly seen blinking as an employee altered the digits.

The news report then cut to pre-recorded interviews with struggling motorists in states across the country. And when the camera returned to the live spot two minutes later, the sign behind Vega read $5.09, $5.19 and $5.29.

A stunned Sawyer could not believe her eyes, and warned drivers not to 'blink at the gasoline station'.

Broadcasting of the rise could not have come at a worse time for President Barack Obama, who is seeking to confront rising public anxiety about soaring prices.

Worry: President Barack Obama is facing rising fuel prices

They are threatening to undercut his re-election prospects and offer Republicans an easy target.

Obama was seeking to rev up his supporters as he hauled in campaign cash yesterday in the important battleground state of Florida, which he may need to capture to hold the White House in November.

He accused his Republican presidential rivals of peddling a philosophy that is "wrong about America," casting them as protectors of the wealthy who would leave everyone else to fend for themselves.

Obama assailed Republicans for offering what he described as flawed and dishonest plans to lower gasoline prices.

He said dismissively that all the Republicans can talk about is more drilling - 'a bumper sticker... a strategy to get politicians through an election' - when America's energy challenges demand much more.

In a speech in Miami, he promoted the expansion of domestic oil and gas exploration but also the development of new forms of energy.

For all the political claims, economists say there is not much a president of either party can do about gasoline prices in the short term.

But it is clear that people are concerned - a new Associated Press-GfK poll said seven in 10 find the issue deeply important - so it is sure to be a political issue through the summer.

Obama aides worry that the rise in prices could reverse the country's economic gains and the president's improved political standing. The poll shows that though Obama's approval rating on the economy has climbed, 58 percent disapprove of what he's doing on gas prices.

Obama insisted there are no short-term solutions to high gas prices, and that anyone suggesting otherwise was not being honest.

Still, he sought to offer something to anxious voters by saying he had ordered his administration to search for every possible area to help consumers in the coming months.

He sought to take credit for rising oil and natural gas production, a greater mix of energy sources and decreased consumption. He promoted an energy strategy that the administration says will reduce dependence on foreign oil in the long term.

Obama said that despite political criticism of his policies 'America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last eight years'.

He also noted that, for the first time in 30 years, the United States is now exporting more petroleum products than it imports.
