This kitten's life was saved by half a litre of vodka after yobs doused her with anti-freeze. 

Missey came home after the incident last week soaking wet and was seriously ill by the next morning.

Her owners Paul Stephenson, 47, and daughter Sara, 27, took the four-month-old to the vets and were shocked when they were told that vodka would help break down the poison.

The unusual treatment was administered via a drip and Missey was understandably pretty drunk after getting through half a litre of 39% vodka over the course of two days. 

Sara said: 'When we heard about the treatment I was just shocked. I had no idea you could even give an animal vodka.

'Missey was totally blind drunk after being fed the vodka on a drip.

Missey's owner Sara, 27, said the kitten was 'blind drunk' after being given vodka to counteract the anti-freeze yobs had doused her in

'She was trying to get up and she just toppled over. Her eyes were out of focus and when we took her home in a carry basket, her mouth has pressed up against the wire so it looked as though she had her teeth bared.

'At one point she was lying down trying to swipe at a pen and she just kept missing it, she was that out of it. It was all just totally mad.'

Missey was treated first at White Cross Vets in Redcar, North Yorkshire, and then taken to Vets Now in Middlesbrough, where her condition was monitored round the clock by staff.

Andrew Miller, a vet at White Cross, explained it is the ethanol in the spirit which neutralises the anti-freeze. 

He said: 'The vodka treatment is quite unusual but is commonly used on animals who have swallowed anti-freeze. The animals are fed the vodka through a drip and they do get quite drunk.

'It is the ethanol used in this particular spirit which helps.

The four-month-old kitten came home  soaking wet and was given half a litre of 39% vodka over two days

'Anti-freeze is extremely toxic to animal's kidneys, and we specifically use vodka because the ethanol in it neutralises the substance in the poison.

'Anti-freeze is life-threatening. Sadly, not all animals we have seen who have swallowed the substance make it, but if seen quickly and if they are given the vodka to react to the anti-freeze, they have a good chance of surviving.'

The kitten is now back at her home in Redcar and being looked after by Sara.

She added: 'The change in her is amazing. She seems to be doing OK, although it is absolutely heartbreaking that someone could do this to an innocent little animal.

'I do not understand why anyone would go out of their way to harm Missey. She's just a baby really, and has such a lovely temperament. You should be able to let your own cat out and not have to worry about this happening.' 

Missey left her house at 10pm last Tuesday but when she returned she appeared unwell and was soaking wet.

At first, Paul and Sara thought the liquid was water but by the next morning, they realised there was something seriously wrong and took her to the vets.

And this is not the first time that the family's cats have been attacked.

Just five weeks ago, four-year-old Molly was covered in tar and was left with a snare wrapped tightly around her neck.

Sara said: 'She was almost screaming at the window to be let in, and when she was she was covered in tar and had a snare around her neck.

'She had no claws from where she had obviously tried to stop herself from being dragged away by the person who attacked her.

'I want whoever is responsible to be caught and brought to justice.

'After this happened I tried to keep Missey indoors, but she somehow managed to get out.'

Another of the family's cats, Timmey, died after eating food laced with caustic soda four years ago.

Anyone who has any information about the attacks is asked to contact Cleveland Police on 101.
