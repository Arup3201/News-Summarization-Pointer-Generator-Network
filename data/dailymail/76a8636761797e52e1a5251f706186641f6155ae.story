She fell apart on the witness stand - weeping, clutching her chest, gagging and gasping for air – when asked to pick up a gun she allegedly used to shoot her husband in their home.

Barbara Sheehan, 50, of Queens, New York, is charged with murdering former NYPD sergeant Raymond Sheehan, 49, in 2008. However she claims he was an abusive, reckless and terrifying man.

She shot her husband 11 times using two handguns that he kept loaded, prosecutors say. But she has pleaded not guilty, claimed self-defence and drawn the attention of domestic violence activists.

‘I'm afraid I'm going to get sick,’ Sheehan said in court on Wednesday, barely able to glance at the .38-calibre revolver that lay on the witness stand next to her. ‘I don't want to do it.’

Sheehan was hammered with questions on her husband's life insurance policies and the moments leading to the shooting by Debra Pomodore, prosecuting, during the third day of cross-examination.

Sheehan was often contradictory and claimed to not remember signing cheques her two children had written to her - proceeds from their father's life insurance policies.

She said that they helped her pay the bills, but that she did not specifically benefit from the money.

Her two children, Jennifer, 25, and Raymond, 21, have both said that their father abused them and their mother, and that they lived in fear of him.

They are expected to testify at the 
trial, and both wept with their mother as she composed herself in a 
courtroom pew after she was asked to hold the revolver.

Law in New York does allow people to defend themselves - but only to a certain extent.

It is legal under state self-defence laws to kill a person if that is required to remove yourself or someone else from danger to your life or lives.

However the law is only to provide protection - so New Yorkers are not allowed to assault beyond removing the threat someone poses.

It could therefore be argued that you are only allowed to shoot someone to the extent where a dangerous situation is diffused.

Jennifer Sheehan and her mother both wore purple to show support for victims of domestic violence. Many other women in the courtroom were also seen wearing the colour.

Prosecutors tried to show on the shooting day in February 2008 Sheehan was not fearful for her life. She proofed her son's school paper, drank coffee and made travel arrangements for a trip to Florida.

Sheehan claimed she didn't want to go with her husband on vacation but was pretending to out of fear because he had said he would kill her if she didn't come. The fight prompted the fatal argument.

He dragged her out of bed the morning of the shooting and threw her out of the house in her pyjamas, saying she couldn't come back until she agreed to go with him, she told the court.

But she stood outside nearly an hour in the winter cold before agreeing to come.

The
retired officer kept loaded his loaded service weapon, a Glock handgun,
and an off-duty gun, the revolver. Often he kept one holstered to his 
side - and the other on his ankle.

'Living with the man I lived with, I tried to survive the best I could'

‘Living with the man I lived with, I tried to survive the best I could,’ she testified.

Assistant District Attorney Ms Pomodore asked repeatedly whether Sheehan ever called 911 or a domestic violence hotline in the hours leading to the shooting. The answer was always no.

After her husband got into the shower, she left to go to a friend's house, where she was frantic. ‘I didn't know what to do,’ she said.

She went back home to get the $1,700 
in cash she had stashed in her drawer and said she planned to tell her 
husband she was going to get dog food but never come back.

She
saw the revolver in the bedroom, took it and walked to the hall. Her 
husband was in the bathroom, recently showered, the Glock by his side on
the vanity table. That's when it happened.

'I don't know what I was thinking then - I was so scared. I thought he'd come after me and kill me. I could see his face, and his eyes, and
his hand and the gun. I 
knew he was going to kill me'

During
testimony, Sheehan was barely understandable through tears - her head 
down, face in her hands, shielding her eyes from Ms Pomodore, as she 
said he pointed the gun at her and she fired.

‘I don't know what I was thinking then - I was so scared,’ she said. ‘I thought he'd come after me and kill me.’ But prosecutors sought to suggest he did not point the gun at her, and noted he never fired.

‘I could see his face, and his eyes, and his hand and the gun,’ she said, her voice rising with every word. ‘I knew he was going to kill me.’

But Sheehan would not answer specific questions, such as where she was standing when the shooting happened and how she ended up with both guns.

She also refused to answer whether she later told her mother that her husband had been laughing at her with the gun, and that was why she shot him.

‘Was he naked?’ Ms Pomodore asked. ‘I don't know,’ Sheehan wept. ‘Was he shaving?’ she asked. ‘I don't know,’ Sheehan replied, later adding that she didn’t know what he was wearing either.

On several occasions, Ms Pomodore asked Sheehan to show the jury how she held the gun at her husband, and each time she said she was physically unable to do it.

The revolver sat on the witness stand, and Sheehan cowered from it. ‘Does this have to be there?’ she asked.

‘It's part of evidence,’ answered acting Queens State Supreme Court Justice Barry Kron. The trial continues.
