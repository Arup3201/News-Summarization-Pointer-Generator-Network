Amelia Warner is married to one of the sexiest men on the planet, who is about to be come the pin-up for millions of bored housewives across the globe. 

Not many women would be up for the task, but Amelia is not your average woman. 

The 32-year-old had a fake marriage  with Colin Farrell at the age of 19 and was cast in a raunchy Hollywood blockbuster opposite Joaquin Phoenix and Michael Caine at the tender age of 17.

She is also an accomplished singer-songwriter, whose tracks have featured on adverts for the likes of John Lewis and Orange mobile phones. 

Amelia is well-placed to deal with the heat from the Fifty Shades of Grey film as she was born into a showbiz family.

Her mother is the actress Annette Ekblom, who starred in Brookside, Cracker and Blood Brothers the musical and her father is the actor Alun Lewis.

Her parent’s relationship didn’t last long though and her mother raised her alone from early on, first in Liverpool and later moving to Ladbroke Grove in west London at the age of six, where her mother still lives.

Amelia was a strong-willed child who inherited her mother’s outgoing character from an early age.

She said of her first acting role – in her school’s nativity play: ‘I've got this idea that who you play in the nativity relates to who you are in life.

‘When I was four, I was Mary. But I wasn't a lovely ethereal Mary, I was a right bossy cow.

‘I stopped the play in the middle to tell Joseph he was doing it all wrong. So that's me.’

Amelia was a good student at the independent Royal Masonic School for Girls in Hertfordshire, although her attention was often swayed by her passion for acting.

She won a place at the Royal Court's youth-theatre group and at the age of 16, she moved to the College of Fine Arts in north London to do her A-Levels.

She said: ‘I began acting at school in Hertfordshire and I always liked it, though I didn't necessarily think I'd do it for a living.

'My plan was to go to Goldsmiths to study history of art, but someone saw me in a play at school and told me that I should meet this agent.

‘I started to get work and so I deferred my place at university.

By 14, Amelia had already had her first Hollywood film part, in Mansfield Park in 1999, as a teenage Fanny Price, and bit parts in TV shows like Kavanagh QC and Casualty, but her main roles came in her later teens.

At the age of 17, she played the part of Lorna Doone in the 2000 film about a farmer who falls in love with the "queen" of the notorious Doone clan.

In that same year, Amelia was awarded the part of Simone on the films Quills, which had an all-star cast featuring Michael Caine, Kate Winslet and Joaquin Phoenix.

She said of the part: ‘I met the casting director for Quills, auditioned for the part, went on tape and got it. It happened just in the straightforward way.'

The movie was to change her life in a large way, although not through acting.

At the film premiere for Quills, she met the Hollywood heart throb Colin Farrell and the pair started a whirlwind relationship. 

Just four months after they met, the couple married on the island of Tahiti, although it was never legalised.

As a symbol of his love, Colin had Amelia’s name tattooed onto his ring finger.

But they split just four months later.

She said afterwards of the wedding: ‘It was just a thing we did on holiday.

‘We went shark feeding and then we did that.

‘We booked them both on the activities desk at the hotel ... It really wasn't this secret wedding that no one was invited to.

‘It was lovely, it was silly, it was sweet but by no means was it a serious thing and I think my mum thought it was quite funny.’

Although their wedding was a joke, the couple were also properly engaged to be married though and Amelia was devastated when they split.

She told The Sun a couple of years ago: ‘Maybe if we had lasted longer as a couple, we would have legalised it.

‘I still look back at that time with him with such fondness, I adored Colin, and I always will — but we're just good friends now.’

After the couple split, Amelia threw herself headfirst into her acting and did back-to-back films for a few years.

In 2005, she played the younger sister of Charlize Theron in the science fiction film Aeon Flux.

Bit parts followed in Winter Passing, Alpha Male, Gone and The Dark Is Rising opposite Christopher Eccleston, but Amelia failed to get a huge box office hit.

But even while she was getting work as an actor, it was clear that her heart wasn’t in it.

She said in an interview to promote Gone in 2006, ‘I do love films, it is exciting as a medium. And acting is a very cool job, but I can't imagine doing it for ever.

‘Ultimately, I would like to be more involved in writing.’

Amelia's first album: Renditions by Slow Moving Millie

Then just a couple of years later, Amelia quit the movie industry and decided to turn her attention to music instead, declaring that ‘music is my soulmate.’

She said of the switch: ‘I got fed up with acting because my heart was never in it - the feedback that I always got was that I didn't want it.

‘I was up against lots of actresses who would fight tooth and nail for a part but I didn't have the passion.’

Amelia renamed herself Slow Moving Millie and released an album of cover hits of Eighties songs by stars like Bananarama and Frankie Goes To Hollywood.

The record also featured two tracks written by Amelia, called Beasts and Hart With A Crown & Chain.

Her cover version of Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths was made the soundtrack to the Christmas advert for John Lewis in 2011.

It was during this reincarnation in 2007 that she met Jamie – the pair were introduced by mutual friends as a party in Hollywood – and the pair have been together ever since.

After a period of dating, the couple moved into a house in Notting Hill together, around the corner from Amelia’s mother.

They also bought a bolthole in the Cotswolds, where they head to when the world of show business proves too much.

The couple’s attitude to celebrity is identical – Amelia despises stardom and actively avoids the more glamorous side of Hollywood.

She said in her early days of acting: ‘I want to stay below the radar and make good films. I have to be careful, I don't want my life to change. 

'I really don't want to be a movie star.’

The couple married in 2013 and last April she gave birth to their first child, Dulcie.

Although they have a base in London, Amelia is hugely supportive of Jamie – she even arranged to give birth in Vancouver when Jamie was filming Fifty Shades Of Grey there.

He told The Telegraph: ‘A lot of people would have had a sh** fit at 30 something weeks pregnant hearing, ‘Darling, we’re going to Vancouver this week for four months - we’re going to have a Canadian baby and I’m going to do a film where, for parts of it, I will be naked.”

‘That’s a tough pitch but my wife is an incredible person.’
