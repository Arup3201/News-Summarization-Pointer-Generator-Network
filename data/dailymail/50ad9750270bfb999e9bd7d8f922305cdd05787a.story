Harlequins prop Will Collier will miss the rest of the season with the knee injury sustained in Saturday's victory over Castres.

The 23-year-old tighthead, who recently signed a new contract until 2018, ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in the Champions Cup match.

'Will has been ruled out for the remainder of this season,' read a statement released by Harlequins.'

The news will come as a blow to Quins, who were already having to swallow the bitter pill of their European exit despite beating Castres.

Leinster’s failure to beat Wasps in Coventry brought a painful end to their Champions Cup hopes even though they ran in an impressive seven tries on Saturday.

Collier later tweeted: 'Thanks for the kind messages. Completely gutted to be missing the remainder of the season! Will be back...fitter and stronger.' 

Quins academy product Collier has played 69 times for the London side since making his debut in their 2011 LV= Cup match against Wasps in Abu Dhabi.

Collier made 20 appearances this season before suffering his season-ending injury.
