Sir Bradley Wiggins is ready to take on the world after claiming third place in the Tour of Britain.

Wiggins (Team Sky) won the penultimate stage of the race, the stage 8a 8.8-kilometre time-trial, before Marcel Kittel (Giant-Shimano) once again triumphed on British soil with a sprint victory over Mark Cavendish (Omega Pharma-QuickStep) on Whitehall.

Dylan van Baarle (Garmin-Sharp) had a 19-second overnight advantage and it proved sufficient to succeed Wiggins as champion, the Dutchman taking the yellow jersey by 10 seconds from Polish runner-up Michal Kwiatkowski (Omega Pharma-QuickStep).

Wiggins, who won the time-trial in nine minutes 50.71 seconds to move up four places to third overall, was 22secs behind and pleased with a podium place after a route that did not suit his style, with short, sharp climbs late in a number of stages.

'They (race organisers) were touting it as the toughest edition (and) most people say it's the hardest race they've done all year,' Wiggins said.

'I was sort of fit for one thing coming here, with only 34 days' racing this year, so I feel like to be here now a week on, in third place, just 20-odd seconds off, I'm pretty pleased with that.'

Wiggins, who won the 2013 Tour of Britain title, began the day 47secs behind Van Baarle, but rolled down the start ramp intent on claiming a stage success from his national tour and duly delivered.

The 34-year-old Londoner will ride the six-man team time-trial with Team Sky next Sunday at the Road World Championships, before switching into the Great Britain skinsuit for the individual time-trial.

'There's a chance I could win it,' added Wiggins, who in 2013 was second to Germany's Tony Martin, who will again be favourite.

'I feel in the form I'm in I'll be in the ball-park. We'll see on the day. I thought I'd be closer to him (Martin) last year and he put 42 seconds into me.'

There was a German victory over a Briton in London when Kittel left it late to power past Cavendish.

Kittel has won Giro d'Italia stages in Belfast and Dublin, Tour de France stages in Harrogate and London and Tour of Britain stages in Liverpool and London this year.

Van Baarle was 29th on the stage to confirm the biggest victory of his career after a decisive move on Saturday.

He said: 'I was expecting top 10. It means a lot. I will remember this day my whole life.'

Van Baarle's success was all-but certain before the concluding stage following an 11th-placed finish in the time-trial, 25secs behind Wiggins.

Wiggins believes his performance in Westminster, although on a far shorter course than the 57.1km route he faces in Ponferrada, is a good indicator of his form.

'Having done the track in the summer it was just a perfect effort for me,' said Wiggins, who was second with England in the team pursuit at the Commonwealth Games.

'Just to win the stage I was more pleased with that, and confirm that I'm in the shape that I thought I was in going into the worlds next week.

'If that top end's there like that to ride an effort like that, once you scale it down a bit in terms of power, for a ride that's sustainable over one hour, it's a good sign.'

Wiggins is negotiating an extension to his Team Sky contract, which expires this year, amid suggestions he could lead a development squad as he turns his attentions from road to track at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016.

'I've got meetings next week,' said Wiggins, after riding for an overall stage race victory for probably the final time.

'There has to be a point where I make that switch (to the track), and with the winter months ahead now I have time to go and change body shape and things like that.'

Wiggins still has ambitions on the road, with the Paris-Roubaix one-day race over the cobbles of northern France a major target for 2015.

Wiggins, who finished ninth in April, added: 'I'll be back at Paris-Roubaix next year. Definitely.'
