Prolific thief Stephanie Swanston, 25, was caught shoplifting and driving her grandfather's car in November last year

Serial thief Stephanie Swanston was caught shoplifting, after stealing her grandfather's car to drive to the supermarket where she gave her sisters name to the police officers who snared her.

The 25-year-old was released from prison four months ago after forging the signatures of three of her grandparents - one of whom was in hospital at the time - and her sister to fraudulently apply for £10,000 in benefits.

She has a string of offences, and has stolen from almost every member of her family.

In the latest episode in Swanston's history of offending, security staff spotted her leaving Asda in Gosforth, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, after stealing a pair of hair clippers.

When police officers arrived to arrest her, the 25-year-old was found to be driving her grandfather George Swanston's Vauxhall Corsa and gave her sister Victoria Swanston's details.

Swanston, of Gateshead, initially pleaded not guilty to one count of theft and one of taking a motor vehicle without consent.

But she changed her plea on the day of trial, confessing to the crimes.

She had already pleaded guilty to driving without a licence, driving with no insurance and obstructing a police officer at an earlier hearing.

Lynne Russell, prosecuting, told Newcastle Magistrates' Court that the offences happened at Asda, in Gosforth, on November 23 last year.

She said: 'She (Swanston) was seen on CCTV taking a box of hair clippers and she left the store without offering payment.

'She was detained by staff and the police were called and officers attended.

The 25-year-old was spotted leaving this Asda store in Gosforth, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, with a pair of hair clippers in her pocket. When police officers arrived and arrested her, Swanston gave her sister Victoria's details

Stephanie Swanston's criminal record reveals 35 previous convictions.

In April 2010 she targeted her parents, grandfathers and uncle in a string of scams, stealing nearly £3,000 for fund overseas holidays.

She also made £7,500 worth of failed loan applications in relatives' names and pawned two of her mother's watches.

She was sentenced to six months in prison.

Months after being released she fleeced her grandparents out of more than £2,000 after stealing their bank cards.

Within three weeks, Swanston targeted four Sainsburys stores, stealing electrical goods before trying to return them in exchange for a refund.

In April last year the 25-year-old was jailed for six months after fraudulently claiming carer's allowance, crisis loans and jobseeker's allowance, totalling more than £10,000.

She admitted forging the signatures of three grandparents and her sister to get her hands on the benefits.

One of her grandfathers was in hospital at the time and has since died. She was sentenced after admitting 15 counts of fraud.

'When they spoke to her, she provided false details and gave her sister, Victoria Swanston's details.

'At
 the police station, officers found her passport in her bag and realised
 it was this defendant and not Victoria Swanston. She then admitted she 
had attempted to avoid arrest.

'From
 the police database system, it became apparent she was insured to drive
 a Vauxhall vehicle, which was found in the Asda car park and the 
registered keeper was her grandfather, George Swanston.

'He was spoken to and said she had taken it without his consent.

'She only had a provisional licence and Mr Swanston said he would not have let her drive the vehicle alone.

'She was insured to drive the vehicle on his insurance but only when she was accompanied.

'The defendant originally said she had driven the car with her grandfather's permission but he denied this was the case.'

Gerry Scott, defending, said: 'The theft of the car was foolish and largely opportunistic.

'She had lost her job at the time and that has caused underlying difficulties.

'In terms of the obstructing PC, that was foolish but it didn't cause the police significant trouble.

'In terms of the taking without consent, their was a breach of trust but there was no bad driving or no damage caused to the vehicle.'

The court was told that Swanston has 35 past convictions, many involving thefts from her family.

The case was adjourned until next month for the preparation of a pre-sentence report. Swanston was bailed until that date.
