The Egyptian army was today patrolling the streets of Cairo after deadly clashes between supporters and opponents of the country's Islamist leader Mohammed Morsi.

Seven people have been killed and almost 500 injured as the tension which has building since the President assumed near total powers over the country threatens to erupt.

Supporters of Mr Morsi attacked his opponents who had gathered to protest outside the presidential palace overnight.

Firebombs and stones were thrown in the bloodiest outbreak since last year's uprising that toppled authoritarian ruler Hosni Mubarak.

Armoured troop carriers have deployed 
and soldiers unfurled barbed wire to protect the palace and help police 
pacify what has become a chaotic battleground.

With at least seven tanks at the 
palace corners, backed by about 10 armoured troop carriers and 20 police
trucks, the two sides mostly shouted slogans at each other from a 
distance.

But the commander of the Republican 
Guard 
said his intention was to separate the opposing sides, not to repress them.

'The armed forces, and at the 
forefront of them the Republican Guard, will not be used as a tool to 
oppress the demonstrators,' General Mohamed Zaki told the state news 
agency.

President Morsi, who has been silent during the turbulence 
of the last few days, will address the nation later today, according to an adviser.

The military played a crucial role in ending Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule by taking over from him to manage a transitional period, but it has stayed out of the latest crisis until now.

It is the first time rival groups have fought openly in the streets after thousands of Mr Morsi's Islamist supporters descended on an area near the presidential palace where 300 opponents were staging a sit-in.

State television quoted the health ministry as saying five people were killed and 446 were injured as mobs battled outside the presidential complex in the Heliopolis district of the capital.

The fighting erupted late yesterday when members of Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood chased the protesters away from their base outside the palace's main gate and tore down their tents.

After a brief lull, hundreds of opponents arrived and began throwing firebombs at the president's backers, who responded with rocks.

The crowds swelled and the clashes continued well after nightfall, spreading from the immediate vicinity of the palace to residential streets nearby.

Hundreds of riot police could not stop the fighting as officers fired tear gas in a bid to disperse Mr Morsi's opponents.

Volunteers ferried the wounded on motorcycles to waiting ambulances, which rushed them to hospitals.

By dawn, the violence had calmed, but both sides appeared to be digging in for a long struggle, with the opposition vowing more protests later today and rejecting any dialogue unless the charter is rescinded.

Mr Morsi is pressing relentlessly forward with plans for a December 15 constitutional referendum to pass the new charter.

The scale and intensity of the fighting marked a milestone in Egypt's divide between the ultra-conservative Muslim Brotherhood and liberals, leftists and Christians.

The violence spread to other parts of the country yesterday. Anti-Morsi protesters stormed and set ablaze the Brotherhood offices in Suez and Ismailia, east of Cairo, and there were clashes in the industrial city of Mahallah and the province of Menoufiyah in the Nile Delta north of the capital.

There were rival demonstrations outside the Brotherhood's headquarters in the Cairo suburb of Moqatam, and in Alexandria security officials said senior Brotherhood official Sobhi Saleh was taken to hospital after being severely beaten by Morsi opponents.

'No different': Opponents of President Morsi say his rule as leader of the Muslim Brotherhood will be 'no different' from Hosni Mubarak

Mr Saleh, a former MP, played a key role in drafting the disputed constitution.

Compounding Morsi's woes, four of his advisers resigned yesterday, joining two other members of his 17-member advisory panel who have abandoned him since the crisis began.

The opposition is demanding he rescind the decrees giving him nearly unrestricted powers and shelve the controversial draft constitution, which the president's Islamist allies rushed through last week in an all-night session shown live on state TV.

Mohamed ElBaradei, a leading opposition reform advocate, said late yesterday that Mr Morsi's rule was 'no different' to Mubarak's.

'In fact, it is perhaps even worse,' the Nobel Peace Prize laureate told a news conference after he accused the president's supporters of a 'vicious and deliberate' attack on peaceful demonstrators outside the palace.

'Cancel the constitutional declarations, postpone the referendum, stop the bloodshed, and enter a direct dialogue with the national forces,' he wrote on his Twitter account, addressing Mr Morsi.

The Supreme Guide of Egypt's Muslim 
Brotherhood, to which Mr Morsi belonged before he was narrowly elected 
president in June, has appealed for unity.

Divisions among Egyptians 'only 
serve the nation's enemies', Mohamed Badie said in a statement.

Opposition activist Hamdi Ghassan said protesters would arrive from other parts
of Cairo later in the day, accusing Mr Morsi's supporters of bringing in 
people from the countryside to boost their presence.

Mr Morsi's opponents accuse him of 
seeking to create a new 'dictatorship' with his November 22 decree.

The president has defended the move
as necessary to prevent courts still full of judges appointed by 
Mubarak from derailing a constitution vital for Egypt's political 
transition.

Around the palace, traffic was moving
through streets strewn with rocks thrown during violence in which 
petrol bombs and guns were also used. Hundreds of Morsi supporters were 
still in the area, many wrapped in blankets and some reading the Koran.

'We came here to support President 
Mursi and his decisions. He is the elected president of Egypt,' said 
demonstrator Emad Abou Salem, 40. 'He has legitimacy and nobody else 
does.'

Mr Morsi's opponents say the Muslim 
Brotherhood, the group that propelled the president to power in a June 
election, is behind the violence. The Brotherhood says the opposition is
to blame and that six of the dead were Mr Morsi supporters.

WESTERN CONCERN

The United States, worried about the 
stability of an Arab state which has a peace deal with Israel and which 
receives $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid, urged dialogue. Britain also
called for restraint and an 'inclusive' political process.

Egyptian Vice President Mahmoud Mekky proposed 'personal ideas' for a negotiated way out yesterday, saying 
amendments to disputed articles in the constitution could be agreed with
the opposition. A written agreement could then go to parliament, to be 
elected after this month's referendum on the constitution.

But the opposition stuck by its demand for Mr Morsi to cancel 
the November 22 decree and postpone the referendum before any dialogue.

Protests spread to other cities, and offices of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party in Ismailia and Suez were torched.

But Mr Mursi has shown no sign of 
buckling under pressure from protesters, confident that the Islamists, 
who have dominated both elections since Mubarak was overthrown, can win 
the referendum and the parliamentary election to follow.

As well as relying on his Brotherhood
power base, Mr Morsi may also draw on a popular yearning for stability and
economic revival after almost two years of political turmoil.

Opposition coordinator Mohamed 
ElBaradei said yesterday the street action and the polarisation of 
society were pushing Egypt into violence and 'could draw us to something
worse'.

The Egyptian pound plunged 4 per cent today to its lowest level in eight years, after previously firming
on hopes that a $4.8 billion IMF loan would stabilise the economy. The 
Egyptian stock market fell 4.4 per cent after it opened.
