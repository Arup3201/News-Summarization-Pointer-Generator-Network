The woman jilted at the altar by celebrity chef Todd English was caught stealing more than $1,000 of cosmetics from Sephora, less than two weeks after she confessed to stealing $52,000 of merchandise from Ralph Lauren.

Erica Wang, 36, who worked at the Ralph 
Lauren she stole from last month, has been accused of also shoplifting from the Fifth 
Avenue franchise of Bergdorf Goodman on 23 February, 2004.

The woman suffered an apparent meltdown after being stopped by security at the Lexington Avenue store recently, and started screaming and threatening to kill herself.

An employee told the New York Post: 'She said she was going to run out into 
the street, throw herself into a car and kill herself.'

She was stopped walking out of this Lexington Avenue Sephora with more than $1,000 of cosmetics

'She was crying. She was on the floor screaming, on her knees, screaming
that they were going to send her to a mental institution. She begged 
not to get arrested and offered to give the stuff back,' a witness 
added.

An employee at the store told the Post security was on to Wang as soon as she walked through the door of 
the trendy cosmetics shop, and watched her as she loaded her Louis Vuitton bag with the designer merchandise.

She stole 41 items in all - including Dior, Yves St Laurent and Urban Decay - to the value of $1,131.

A store employe said: 'She stole from almost every brand in 
the store. She was obvious about it. When she walked 
out of the door, she said, "I’ll pay double for everything! Please!"'

'It took [cops] 15 minutes to get down 
the stairs. She knelt on the floor. She said, "I have money". She 
pleaded with her hands clasped, "I’m the ex-fiancée of Todd English!"'

Wang appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court today on one count of grand larceny and one count of possession of stolen property.

Her lawyer told the judge she had 'emotional-slash-psychological problems'.

Todd English, 51, has overseen a number of eateries including The Plaza 
Hotel Food Hall in New York, Figs in Florida, and Olives in Boston and 
Las Vegas.

The restaurateur is divorced from his first wife, Olivia, with whom he had three children.

He had planned to marry Wang in October 2009 in a lavish $150,000 wedding at the St Regis Hotel in New York.

But
just hours before the ceremony, Mr English phoned Wang and told her: 'I
know this call is long overdue, but I can’t marry you today.'

'Todd English is lucky he didn’t 
marry her,' a source told the Post.

Wang, 36, had been working at the Ralph Lauren store in Madison Avenue for eight months

The 36-year-old was caught 
taking almost $6,000 of clothing late last month from Ralph Lauren. When she was caught by a coworker, she then confessed to 
swiping another $46,000 in merchandise.

She had been working at the designer's flagship shop, on Madison Avenue at East 72nd Street, for nearly eight months.

According to a criminal complaint 
that cited a witness, Wang stuffed nine items, worth $5,944.25, into a 
black shopping bag last week.

She was apprehended by a colleague after trying leave through the employee exit.
