Climate change experts have been trying for years to explain why the sea ice in Antarctica is expanding.

Now scientists claim to have found the answer – global warming.

They believe the paradoxical shift is caused by water melting from beneath the Antarctic ice shelves and re-freezing back on the surface.

The frozen sea around the South Pole 
has been steadily growing, reaching a record extent in the winter of 
2010, while the Arctic ice at the north of the planet shrank to a record
 low last year.

Now a team from the respected Royal 
Netherlands Meteorological Institute says that the fresh water melting 
from the Antarctic ice sheets has a relatively low density compared to 
the denser salty seawater, so it accumulates in the top layer of the 
ocean during the summer months.

The surface waters re-freeze during autumn and winter to spread across a greater area.

The Dutch study, published yesterday 
in the journal Nature Geoscience, says: ‘Sea ice around Antarctica is 
increasing despite the warming global climate. This is caused by melting
 of the ice sheets from below. This powerful negative feedback 
counteracts Southern Hemispheric atmospheric warming.’

September 26, 2012, when ice covered more of the Southern Ocean than at any other time in the satellite record.

The researchers predict the phenomenon will continue.

The Earth’s poles have very different 
geography. Surrounded by North America, Greenland and Eurasia, the 
Arctic ice cap floats on the ocean, not land. It has lost a large amount
 of its older, thicker sea ice over the last 30 years, making it more 
vulnerable to the warming trend.

The Antarctic, however, is a continent
 circled by open waters that lets sea ice expand during the winter but 
also offers less shelter during the melt season.

The Dutch report notes that despite 
the increase in surface ice expansion each winter, the total mass of ice
 around Antarctica is continuing to shrink because of the underwater ice
 melt. The study is not the first to put forward a reason for the 
Antarctica effect. However, there is some scepticism about the findings.

The British Antarctic Survey and Nasa believe wind in behind the rise in ice levels in the Antarctic

Paul Holland of the British Antarctic 
Survey stuck to his findings in a report last year that a shift in winds
 linked to climate change was blowing a layer of meltwater further out 
to sea and adding to winter ice.

‘The possibility remains that the real
 increase is the sum of wind-driven and meltwater-driven effects, of 
course. That would be my best guess, with the meltwater effect being the
 smaller of the two,’ he said.

The Dutch report also speculated that a
 cold layer of water created offshore may be responsible for lower than 
average snowfall in Antarctica, as it cools the air above it. Cold air 
can hold less moisture than warm.

‘Cool sea surface temperatures around 
Antarctica could offset projected snowfall increases in Antarctica, with
 implications for estimates of future sea-level rise,’ said the study.

At a winter maximum in September, ice 
on the sea around Antarctica covers about 7.3million square miles, 
bigger than Antarctica’s land area.

The scientists say the Antarctic sea ice has shown a small but significant growth of 1.9 per cent per decade since 1985.
