An investigative hearing has recommended that an American soldier be court-martialed over hazing that allegedly led to a fellow infantryman's suicide in Afghanistan, but dismissed the most serious charge against him.

Specialist Ryan Offutt is one of eight soldiers charged in the death of 19-year-old Private Danny Chen, who shot himself on October 3 after what investigators say were weeks of physical abuse, humiliation and racial slurs.

A native New Yorker of Chinese descent, Mr Chen had been in Afghanistan only two months when he shot himself in a guardhouse at a remote outpost in Afghanistan's Kandahar province.

Criminal: Specialist Ryan Offutt punched and choked his ex-girlfriend, stripping her, in a sadistic beating in 2001

Mr Chen's family has said investigators told them that he was subjected to numerous racial slurs and forced to do excessive sit-ups, push-ups, runs and sprints carrying sandbags as punishment for not being as physically fit as the rest of the platoon.

On the day that he killed himself, he forgot his helmet and water when he went to report to the guardhouse. His superiors forced him to crawl over 100 meters of gravel with all of his equipment when he returned, all the while having other soldiers throw rocks at him.

The investigative hearing recommended 
that Offutt, 32, be court-martialed on charges including assault, 
negligent homicide, and reckless endangerment, a statement from U.S. 
military said after the hearing ended Sunday.

The most serious charge Offutt now faces is negligent homicide, which carries a prison sentence of up to three years.

Offutt, from Greenville, who measured more than 6ft is thought to have been among the worst of the alleged bullies.

In October 2001 Offutt was charged with aggravated assault and attempted rape, the Daily News reported.

His former girlfriend told police he beat her and ripped off her clothes.

'Offutt tried to have intercourse with her,' a criminal complaint alleged. She 'had to fight Offutt to escape.'

The soldier's roommates woke up to the noise of the girl screaming, the complaint states. They found her 'naked and bleeding from the face.'

In that case, Offutt pleaded guilty 
to simple assault and indecent assault and was sentenced to four months 
to two years in prison.  He was also obliged to attend drug and alcohol 
treatment.

Offutt joined the army in 2006 and is  based at Fort Wainright, Alaska.

The regional American military commander will make a final decision on any court-martial based on the hearing's recommendations, the U.S. statement said.

Attorneys for Offutt could not immediately be contacted. Offutt, a native of Greenville, Pennsylvania, joined the Army in 2006 and served 14 months in Iraq before being deployed to Afghanistan.

Seven other members of Mr Chen's unit will face similar hearings to Offutt’s over the next month at Kandahar Air Field, the sprawling base for U.S. and Nato operations in the south.

In action: Sergeant Travis F. Carden was one of eight soldiers charged

One of those men- First Lt. Daniel Schwartz, the only officer charged with Chen’s death- also has a record, the Daily News reported.

The 25-year-old Maryland man was arrested five years ago for possession of a controlled substance, according to records.

The Army has identified the other soldiers charged as Staff Sargent Blaine G. Dugas, 35, of Port Arthur, Texas; Staff Sargent Andrew J. Van Bockel, 26, of Aberdeen, South Dakota; Sargent Adam M. Holcomb, 29, of Youngstown, Ohio; Sargent Jeffrey T. Hurst, 26, of Brooklyn, Iowa; Specialist Thomas P. Curtis, 25, of Hendersonville, Tennessee; and Sargent Travis F. Carden, 24, of Fowler, Indiana.

All are members of the 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division based out of Fort Wainwright, Alaska.
