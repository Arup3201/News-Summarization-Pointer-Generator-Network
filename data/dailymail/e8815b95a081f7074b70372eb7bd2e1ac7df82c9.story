A heartbroken mother whose pregnant daughter was killed in a car crash has given birth to a baby of her own.

Maria Williams, 40, and her eldest daughter, Sophie, 20, were pregnant at the same time and used to compare their bumps.

The mother and daughter were both expecting girls who would have been raised 'like sisters' - even though they were aunt and niece.

Maria Williams, 40 whose pregnant daughter Sophie was killed in a car crash has had a new baby girl of her own - baby Sasha.
Maria and her eldest daughter, Sophie, 20, were pregnant at the same time and were looking forward to being new mothers together

But their dream was shattered when Sophie, who has a different father to Sascha, was killed in a car accident just two weeks before she was due to give birth.

Doctors battled to save her unborn baby girl Kayleigh but she also died in the crash near the family home.

Maria feared the shock would bring on a miscarriage but she is now the proud mother of baby Sasha, who is helping her come to terms with her tragic loss.

The mother and daughter were happy that their two little girls would grow up together - even though they were aunt and niece but sadly their dream was shattered after Sophie, pictured as a child, and unborn baby Kayleigh were killed in a car accident

Maria and Sophie would compare the size of their bumps and talk over the names they both liked. Sophie, who has a different father to Sascha, used to joke how her baby was going to have an aunt younger than her

Maria, pictured when pregnant, said that the only thing that kept her going was that the baby she was carrying and the little kicks she was getting every day reminded her she was there

Mother-of-five Maria said: 'It was a bit of a surprise when we both fell pregnant at about the same time but we were thrilled.

'I lost my daughter and granddaughter in an instant - it was too much to bear. Heartbreak doesn’t even describe it.

A double funeral was held for the young mother and her unborn baby killed in the tragic accident.

Maria said: 'The only thing that kept me going was that the baby I was carrying and the little kicks I was getting every day to remind me she was there.'

Baby Sasha was born in May and Maria says she is 'just like' her big sister Sophie.

Maria, of Tredegar, South Wales, said: 'When I held Sasha in my arms all I could think of was Sophie and her baby and the exciting times we had planned together.

'We had dreamed of pushing our prams around the park together but now that will never happen.

'But I still feel lucky - Sasha has become my reason to go on, to stay alive and keep living when I felt like giving up.'

Sophie and mechanic Ben had another little girl Mia, two.

Ben, who survived the accident with a broken collar bone and fractured ribs, is bringing up toddler Mia with the help of Maria and her family.

An inquest is due to be held into the fatal accident at an accident blackspot on the A465 Heads of the Valleys Road in South Wales.
