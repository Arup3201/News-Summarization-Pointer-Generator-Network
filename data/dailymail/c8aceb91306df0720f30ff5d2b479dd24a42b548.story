The phrase 'I’m eating for two' has burdened many pregnant women with extra weight to lose after giving birth.

Even though official guidelines suggest women should put on no more than two stone while pregnant, it’s easy to get carried away during those nine months and recent statistics have found that up to 15 per cent of mothers are obese during pregnancy, jeopardising not only their own health, but also that of the next generation.

Hazel Frewin was certainly eating for two and piled on a staggering 8st 5lbs during her pregnancy, making her clinically obese.

Eating for two: Hazel Frewin, who put on weight after being pregnant with her daughter Ivy, has now gone from 19st back to 10st

Due to her sudden weight gain, she was left suffering from birth complications, agoraphobia, anxiety and panic attacks.

Hazel, 25, from Poole, Dorset, reached 19st by the time she gave birth to baby Ivy, going from a size 12 to a maternity size 24.

When her daughter was born - weighing in at a large 10lb 3oz- guilt-ridden Hazel blamed herself for making her baby fat.

Now after a two-year battle, she has lost most of the weight thanks to a combination of diet and exercise - including pole dancing.

Hazel said: 'I hope my story stops other pregnant women from making the same mistake. When I was pregnant, I happily indulged all my cravings because I was "eating for two".

New hobby: Hazel has toned up using pole-dancing exercises and even had a pole fitted at home to practice on

Big loser: While she feels that 'eating for two' ruined her post-pregnancy, slowly, the weight came off and Hazel is now a size 12 and weighs 10st 10lb

'I ignored how big I was getting but as soon as my baby was born, reality hit.

'Not only was I still huge after having her but also she was much bigger than expected which meant I couldn’t have the birth I wanted and needed surgery after delivery.

'I spent my pregnancy gorging on biscuits and crisps, and my baby suffered. I couldn’t believe how stupid I had been.'

Hazel was a size 12 when she and husband Daniel, 29, started trying for baby number two in 2010.

They already had a son, Charlie, three, and Hazel had sailed through her first pregnancy.

But it was a different story when she fell pregnant again in April 2010.

Days before her three-month scan was due, Hazel suffered a bleed and was taken to hospital. It was confirmed she was miscarrying her baby.

Comfort eating: After falling pregnant again after a miscarriage, Hazel was so happy, relieved and excited that she stopped focusing on maintaining her trimmer weight

The devastated mother took comfort in food. She said: 'I was so crushed I just didn’t care about my diet or myself. I ate whatever I wanted, when I wanted and told myself it was OK because I would be pregnant again soon.'

Hazel piled on two stone in as many months. But there was no time to worry about it before she learned she was expecting again.

'I was so happy, relieved and excited to be pregnant again that I didn’t care about the weight gain. All I cared about was my baby.

'I constantly craved chocolate — from bars to biscuits, cakes and milkshakes — so I ate everything I fancied and made sure there was a constant supply. When you are expecting, nobody bats an eyelid if you buy piles of chocolate — in fact, people smile and tell you to enjoy it.'

Problems and complications: Her weight meant she was denied the water birth she dreamed of because she was too big to stay in the pool

As Hazel’s pregnancy progressed, midwives gently reminded her about the importance of healthy eating.

But the stretchy waistband on her maternity gear offered no real warnings as to how big she was really getting.

She said: 'If I craved a bag of crisps I would think nothing of eating four bags in one go. All I could see was my bump growing and my husband was constantly telling me how gorgeous I was, so I didn’t worry.'

At seven months she was struck by a pregnancy-related mobility condition called SPD (Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction).

Excessive weight gain is a major contributing factor. It left Hazel almost bedbound and she simply ate more.

Trim and toned: Without her baby bump for comfort, Hazel suddenly felt conscious of her weight and has now slimmed down

By the time she was due to give birth in April 2011, Hazel weighed 19st. At just 5ft 4in, she was wearing size 24 maternity clothing.

Her weight meant she was denied the water birth she dreamed of because she was too big to stay in the pool.

Happy and healthy: Hazel is now happy and healthy at size 12

And there was another shock in store for Hazel after an agonising six-hour labour.

'There were gasps from the midwives and when I saw Ivy, I realised why. She was beautiful but she was huge. She was almost twice the size of some newborns and looked more like a three-month-old baby,' said Hazel.

Without her baby bump for comfort, Hazel suddenly felt conscious of her weight.

'I weighed myself when I got home and was shocked to see I was still 18st 2lb. Suddenly I didn’t feel blooming. I felt sickened, ashamed and plain fat,' she said.

Hazel’s husband urged her to see her GP for help but she was too embarrassed.

'I didn’t have the courage to walk in and say I was having panic attacks and agoraphobia because I ate too much when I was pregnant. It was too shameful.'

Instead she decided to lose the weight alone. In August 2011 she joined a slimming club and started following a healthy eating plan.

She said: 'It was hard after eating non-stop in my pregnancy but the group meetings kept me focused and I made sure I was always full up on salad and vegetables.'

Slowly, the weight came off and Hazel is now a size 12 and weighs 10st 10lb.

She’s toned up using pole-dancing exercises and even had a pole fitted at home to practice on.

She added: 'The weight took months to go on and almost two years to come off.

'"Eating for two" ruined what should have been the happiest time with my newborn — and I’ve spent the last two years paying for it.'
