Carlos 'Halfy' Rodriguez lost a large portion of his brain and skull after flying through his car's windscreen and landing on his head

Speaking out for the first time, many thought that his appearance was fake - until now

'That is why it is not good drinking and driving, or drugs and driving. It is no good kids,' he warns.

But despite his anti-drugs stance it appears he still continues to smoke cannabis every day

A bad boy who was left with half a head following a dramatic accident has spoken out for the first time - blaming his astonishing appearance on a drink and drugs binge.

Carlos 'Halfy' Rodriguez, who also goes by the name Sosa, lost a large portion of his brain and skull in a crash after flying through his car's windscreen and landing head-first on the road.

In a new video he has used his appearance and story to warn others not to drink and take drugs.

Doctors were forced to cut away large amounts of flesh and bone to help him survive and he has since been able to continue his life in Miami, Florida.

WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Incredible: From side on the damage caused by his crash is obvious

Both sides: 'Halfy' as he is now known, shows his skull to camera in this new video

Warning: Carlos admits that he was on drink and drugs while driving and warns others not to do the same

From the front: Carlos speaks to camera for the first time and from this angle the damage to his head is not clear

'I was barred out on drugs. I was driving and I hit a pole and flew out the front window and landed on my head,' he said in a new warning message on You Tube.

Showing his head to camera he added: 'And this is how the old boy has come out. That is why it is not good drinking and driving or drugness (sic) and driving. It is no good kids.'

According to the German tabloid Bild he had the accident aged 14.

'I was with a cousin and a friend stole the car, there was a near-fatal car accident. As the speed was too fast we lost control of the car and crashed,' he said.

Mr Rodriguez shot to fame two years ago after he was was arrested for allegedly soliciting prostitution.

Miami Police had problems with their paperwork and his forms contained no name and simply the description 'half a head'.Â

His mugshots, showing his missing forehead and battered skull, spread across the world online but many thought that it was a hoax.

However this new video has proved that he and his extreme injuries exist.

Bad boy: 'Halfy' still smokes drugs, despite his warning to others

But despite his serious message to stay 
away from narcotics, it appears that he is yet to change his ways after 
admitting he still smokes a lot of drugs.

Survivor: British teenager Ben Maycock was lucky to be alive after a brutal hammer attack left him a huge dent in his skull

In a bizarre tirade he also accuses American President Barrack Obama of doing the same.

'This is what I do daily: burn a stake,' which is slang for a joint.

'Obama is the President of ya'll United States and he smokes. (Expletive) has the whole White House growing.

'Then why can't I smoke me a blunt?'.

'Halfy' is not the only person to survive with half a head, as several other Britons have done the same.

Teenager Ben Maycock was lucky to be alive after a brutal hammer attack left him a huge dent in his skull in 2010.

The vicious assault left Ben's head shattered - and doctors had to hack away huge chunks in a battle to save his life.

Medics at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, doubted Ben would survive his horrific injuries, and told his grief-stricken mum to prepare for the worst, but incredibly, he survived.
