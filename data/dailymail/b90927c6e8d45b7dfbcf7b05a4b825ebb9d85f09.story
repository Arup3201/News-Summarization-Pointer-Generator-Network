Arsene Wenger fears Alexis Sanchez is running out of steam and is searching for the right moment to give the £32million Chile striker a well-earned break.

Only Per Mertesacker has played more for Arsenal this season than Sanchez, who has played for 3,326 minutes in his debut campaign, scoring 19 goals but only one in his last 11 appearances.

'He's a bit fatigued and in a position where he has scored less,' said boss Wenger. 'He wants to force his game and then is more involved in physical battles. Maybe goalscoring is on his mind, so he wants to do too much and he wants to force his game.

But Wenger concedes the games are too important to leave out his star 19-goal forward

Despite his early-season form the former Barcelona attacker has only netted once in his last 11 games

'I'm tempted to give him a break at some stage. I have been for a long time. It's not that he won't let me, I will decide that. It's just that every game now is so important, you always have a hesitation to do it.'

Arsenal are at Newcastle in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday, and Wenger will expect a reaction after sliding out of the Champions League on Tuesday.

The trip to Tyneside may present a good opportunity to rest Sanchez, with plenty of available options, including Tomas Rosicky set to return after illness, and the manager attempting to keep his squad fresh for the FA Cup defence and to finish as high as possible in the Premier League.

Wenger believes Arsenal are too far behind league leaders Chelsea to make a late push for the title

Jose Mourinho claimed Arsenal were back in the title race after a two-point swing last weekend, even though they remain seven points behind leaders Chelsea with a game fewer to play.

Wenger said: 'At the moment we are too far away from Chelsea, but we have an opportunity every week to get closer and for that we need positive results from us and negative results from Chelsea. I believe Chelsea still has a very good cushion and very good security.'
