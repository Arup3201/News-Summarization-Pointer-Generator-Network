Three-time Wimbledon runner-up Andy Roddick will return to London to make his debut at the Statoil Masters Tennis at the Royal Albert Hall in December.

The 32-year-old American, who retired in 2012, was beaten by Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final in 2004, 2005 and 2009 but did win the US Open title in 2003.

Roddick said: 'I love London, I love playing in front of British fans, and I'm really looking forward to playing in the Statoil Masters Tennis at the Royal Albert Hall for the first time.

'After the 2009 Wimbledon final I felt that people really understood me in Britain and I'll never forget the response.

'It's exciting to be able to come back post-career and play in another special arena against so many of my contemporaries.'

Roddick joins Tim Henman, Greg Rusedski and Mark Philippoussis in the field for the seniors event, which takes place from December 3-7.

The 32-year-old American had great success in London, coming runner-up at Wimbledon on three occasions
