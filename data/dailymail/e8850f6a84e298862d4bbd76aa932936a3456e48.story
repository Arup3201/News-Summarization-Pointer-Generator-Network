Big claimer: The BBC paid for its former Chief operating officer Caroline Thomson to fly to America - a month after she lost her job

The BBC paid £4,200 for its top female executive to fly to the United States – two weeks after she left the corporation.

Caroline Thomson lost her job in September when her role was axed but still collected a pension pot of £1.71million and exit package worth £670,000 – more than twice her salary.

By October the former chief operating officer, who had been tipped as director general, had jetted to Phoenix, Arizona, for a junket paid for by licence fee payers.

The details emerged in the latest report breaking down expenses for senior BBC executives.

Taxi fares for executives earning more than £150,000 have gone up by almost a fifth in a year, it shows.

Miss Thomson, 58, spent £1,178.97 on cabs in the last three months of her 37-year BBC career.

BBC North director Peter Salmon claimed £150.25 for a single journey last June and BBC1 controller Danny Cohen claimed £164 for taxis over two days last August.

Creative director Alan Yentob, who is paid £168,300, spent £822.88 on cars in his quarterly claim.

And former director general Mark Thompson clawed back £454.89 for a two-night stay at a New York hotel last February. He later become chief executive of the New York Times Company but the BBC says the trip was not connected to his search for a job.

Other significant costs included a claim of £586 for flights by £332,900-a-year ‘director of BBC people’ Lucy Adams, when she had to cut her holiday short last year to fulfil a ‘critical role’ in planning for the start of the new director general.

Rising costs: Expense claims for taxi fares at the BBC have risen by nearly a fifth in the space of a year

At the other end of the scale, there was evidence of penny-pinching by senior bosses.

Mr
Thompson claimed £2.50 for a tram to MediaCity in Salford and director 
of global news Peter Horrocks claimed 6p for a Skype call from his 
personal mobile phone.

The 
corporation yesterday claimed it has made ‘significant progress’ in 
reducing expenditure, with total expenses down by 8 per cent in a year.

‘The
bulk of our expenses are unavoidable routine costs incurred in running a
major international broadcasting organisation,’ said a spokesman.

Miss Thomson’s US trip was arranged before her departure, he added.

Last night Conservative MP Jake Berry said the BBC should ‘embrace transparency’.

‘At
a time when the BBC is pledging to cut costs it beggars belief that 
they are paying for former executives to go on taxpayer funding 
junkets,’ he said.
