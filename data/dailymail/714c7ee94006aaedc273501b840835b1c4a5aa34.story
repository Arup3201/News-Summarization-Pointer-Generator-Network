A house in London thought to be one of the smallest in Britain is up for sale, but it will set buyers back more than a quarter of a million pounds.

The pint-sized property is made up of just 188 sq ft of living space but still crams in a kitchen, living area, bathroom and bedroom.

Described by estate agents as 'unique', the cosy home boasts just one room and its front door is underneath the bed.

 A 188 sq ft house in an exclusive part of north London is up for sale for more than a quarter of a million pounds

The pint-sized, one-roomed property, in Barnsbury, Islington, will set its future buyer back £275,000

The bedroom, suspended above the front door, is just 7ft 7ins x 5ft 8ins in size but does have storage space

The house's buyers will be forced to walk across the kitchen worktop before balancing on narrow steps, to make it to the 7ft 7ins x 5ft 8ins airborne 'bedroom'.

The raised living area, complete with cushions and a small table, also has a small amount of storage space.

The house is on the highly-sought after Richmond Avenue, one street away from Tony Blair's former house on Richmond Crescent.

Blair sold that house for £615,000 in 1997 but it is now worth more than £3million.

The future owners will brush shoulders with Hi-de-Hi! actress Su Pollard, who lives on Richmond Avenue. 

Despite being barely the size of a lock-up garage, the home, in Barnsbury, North London, will set buyers back £275,000 - more than £1,450 a square foot.

Research by MailOnline earlier this year showed that in some parts of London, house prices rose by almost five times the average wage.

The average house price in Westminster rose by an astonishing £160,810 to £976,822 in a year, while workers took home a median salary of £34,092. 

The housing bubble has forced many Londoners into renting, but in turn this has pushed up rent and demand for flats across the capital.

Some landlords have split their family homes into tiny 'semi studios', meaning they can make more money but leaving tenants in cramped accommodation.

Platinum Property Partners, a buy-to-let mortgage lender, said recently that landlords could make up to £38,000 in annual rental income by splitting a family home into flats, compared to around £18,000 if they did not.

The bathroom is the only separate room in the house, but is barely large enough to fit a lavatory and a shower

Winkworths, the estate agent selling the house, described it as 'unique' and added that they had already had a number of calls about it.

He said: 'It's possibly the smallest house in the world. It's just been developed and put on the market.

'I think it will probably sell to an investor who'll let it as a short-let. It's a great crash pad for the area. It's got everything a house would have and the space is cleverly used.

'There's storage under the raised part of the living area, a patio out the front and a window. I've been to the property and it's a really sweet house - it works.'

While house prices and rent in London continue to soar, for just £5,000 more than the price of this property a buyer could purchase a two-bed house in the Lake District.

A converted hotel, situated just a few miles from Windermere, Cumbria, has an open-plan kitchen, patio and its own parking space and costs £280,000.

For the same price a buyer could pick up a three-bed detached family home in Penryn, Cornwall.

One such house, with an asking price of £275,000, has a large double bedroom with an en suite bathroom, two bedrooms for children and a large back garden.

Guinness World Records currently recognise a house in Conwy, north Wales, as Britain's smallest house.

The house, aptly called The Smallest House in Great Britain, is just 10ft tall and has two rooms.

It can only fit four people at a time and it around 6ft wide, but thousands of tourists still pay the £1 (50p for children) fee to enter the cramped, red house every year.

It was occupied for about 200 years until local fisherman Robert Jones, who was 6ft 3ins tall, moved out in 1900.

Local tour guide Anne Fletcher, 58, dons traditional Welsh dress to give visitors an authentic experience, and explained why the pint-sized home is a mecca for mini-home spotters the world over.

She said: 'Thousands of people come to the Smallest House in Great Britain each year. That means we get hundreds of people every week during the height of summer.'
