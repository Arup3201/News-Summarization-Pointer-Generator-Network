Police in a Paris suburb are facing the sack after blackening up their faces with boot polish and eating bananas during a fancy dress party.

The officers, from Kremlin-Bicetre, thought pictures of the party would remain private, however the images which show them smiling with their blacked up faces and afro wigs appeared on social media, where they quickly spread.

One of the photos even shows one officer with a bunch of bananas, scratching himself if he were a monkey, with a bucket of nuts on the ground in front of him.

The officers in the pictures have now been suspended.

The department which investigates police officer behaviour in France, the Inspection Generale de la Police Nationale, is set to question them this week.

It is thought they could be sacked or fined for insulting behaviour.

The pictures have caused outrage across France with anti-racism groups slamming their behaviour.

Louis-Georges Tin, president of the Conseil Represantatif des Associations Noires said: 'If the police officers who have the responsibility to fight racism are busy making fun of black people than defending them, it could explain why things have advanced so little in this domain.'

Mr Tin has asked for a meeting with France's top policeman, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve to discuss the pictures.

He added: 'The black people of this country don't have to put up with racial profiling by people who dress up like this at night.'

The blacked up photo scandal comes after a string of high-profile racist taunts directed at France's black Justice Minister Christiane Taubira.

In November 2013, far-right weekly magazine Minute published a cover page with the headline 'Crafty as a monkey, Taubira gets her banana back'.
