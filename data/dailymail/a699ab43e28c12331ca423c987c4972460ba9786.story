Police in Florida have arrested two teenagers for tying a dog to railroad tracks and shooting it.

Officers at Tampa Police Department announced in a press conference on Wednesday night that the dog, since named Cabela, was bought from her owners for use in dog fights.

Her owners had previously said that she had escaped or was stolen from their yard.

She was bought by Natwan Callaway and Bobby Hollinger, both 17, who found that Cabela, a one-year-old pit bull mix, was 'too sweet tempered to fight' according to police.

Detective Sgt. Patrick Messmer said a tip led to surveillance footage that showed an individual known to police who was then able to identify other people in the video.

Callaway and Hollinger have been charged as adults.

One of the two teenagers has a lengthy record to which can now be added charges of aggravated animal cruelty and trespassing.

Cabela is now on the mend after her ordeal, and has been inundated with gifts and cards from well-wishers

The suspects turned themselves in voluntarily and have confessed. It is likely additional charges will be filed and other individuals will also be arrested.

WTSP reported that in the video police saw a group of people walking the dog towards the railroad tracks in the Sulphur Springs area.

Hollinger took Cabela into the woods and shot at her, but she ran away uninjured and was found at home.

Callaway and Hollinger caught her and took her back to the railroad tracks, tied her down and Callaway shot her several times, police said.

In the video, some people walk away, and then two people are seen running away.

Officers received three 911 calls at around 5:23 p.m. on Wednesday March 4 from people reporting hearing gunshots.

They heard a dog whimpering while canvassing the neighborhood, and followed the sound to nearby train tracks.

Survivor: The young pit bull mix, named Cabela, suffered injuries  so severe it was feared that her front-right leg (right) would have to be amputated. Vers were able to pin the leg instead

Officers discovered the blood-spattered pup had been shot twice in the neck and once in the shoulder and tied to the tracks.

They freed Cabela and immediately took her to the Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Center, where she is staying during her recovery.

Her injuries were so severe that it was feared that the pup's front right leg would need to be amputated.

However, veterinarians were able to save the leg.

A post on the vet's Facebook page read: 'Cabela came through surgery with flying colors and four legs. The surgeon decided to pin it instead of amputation. It will be 6 to 8 weeks before we know whether she will regain full use and motion.' 

Cabela is doing very well, her bandage was removed on Tuesday and she is already bearing a small amount of weight on her leg. Her chances of making a full recovery are improving

On Wedneday evening following the police announcement that Cabela's attackers had been charged, Katy Meyer, owner of the veterinary practice posted her thanks to police and gave an update on Cabela's condition.

'Justice for Cabela, now that an arrest has been made!'

'We wish to thank the the Tampa Police Department for their thorough investigation into this horrible crime. We hope the individuals reponsible will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.'

She added: 'Cabela is doing very well, her bandage was removed last night and she is already bearing a small amount of weight on her leg. Her chances of making a full recovery are improving.'

Once Cabela fully recovers, she will be spayed, vaccinated and put up for adoption.
