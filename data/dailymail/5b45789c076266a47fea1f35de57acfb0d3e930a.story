Kris Commons is weighing up his Parkhead future after he was axed from the starting XI for Tuesday’s Champions League defeat to Maribor.

Celtic’s top scorer with 32 goals last season, the 31-year-old was deeply unhappy at beginning the dismal 1-0 defeat to the Slovenian champions on the bench.

Commons – also a substitute for the first leg in Slovenia - is understood to have sought an explanation from coach Ronny Deila and, despite being introduced to the fray after 45 minutes, was the first player to leave the stadium at time-up.

Going? Kris Commons could leave Celtic after he was dropped for the second leg against Maribor

A stand-out last season, the achievements of the attacking midfielder were marked by player of the year awards from PFA Scotland and the Scottish Football Writers last season.

But with 12 months remaining on his current deal, Commons is likely to delay talks over a new contract until he receives assurances he will start under Deila.

Norwich, Leicester and West Brom are all watching his situation, with the former Scotland international entitled to speak to other clubs from January.

Asked after Maribor if Commons still had a future under his stewardship, Deila insisted: ‘Kris has played almost every game as long as I have been Celtic manager, so of course.’

Deila also faces a fight to keep hold of unsettled Virgil van Dijk after the Dutch defender claimed he wants to play in the Champions League.

Sevilla have sold defender Federico Fazio to Spurs and have earmarked the 23-year-old as a potential replacement, with Newcastle also interested.

Speaking to Dutch broadcasters NOS after the Maribor defeat, van Dijk said: ‘You want to play at the highest level and the Champions League is that.

‘We’ll see what happens. Just now I am still a Celtic player. The transfer market is open until Sunday night.’

Ironically, Sevilla could be one of Celtic’s opponents in the Europa League with the Spanish side in pot one of Friday’s draw.

Deila claimed on Tuesday night he still hopes to land two more new faces to bolster his flagging squad after completing a one-year loan deal for Ghanaian World Cup winger Wakaso Mubarak yesterday.

Serbian striker Stefan Scepovic remains a £2million target, despite the 24-year-old claiming PSV Eindhoven also want him.

‘I know Celtic want me but the Sporting board has told me that so far they didn’t receive any offer from Scotland,’ the Serbian told media in his homeland.

‘But Sporting will sell me, that is for sure. They even told me not to train and play so I could not get injured.

‘Celtic? I would be happy to go there. But PSV is also big club and I must admit there are even more options. I think soon everything will be sorted out.’

Wanted: Celtic could make a move for Stefan Scepovic before the transfer deadline next week
