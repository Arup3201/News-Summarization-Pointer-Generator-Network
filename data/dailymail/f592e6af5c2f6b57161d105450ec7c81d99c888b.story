Last month, Donna O'Connor received a chilling, late-night text message0 from her 33-year-old daughter who lives in Brooklyn's Greenpoint neighborhood.

'I'm scared,' Dana Bonanno wrote in her text message to her mother. She hasn't been seen since.

The late-night text occurred on July 22, but Bonanno wasn't declared missing until five days later - despite repeated calls to police from her mother about her missing daughter.

'I
can’t stop to think about what’s going on and get upset. What good is 
that going to do,' O’Connor told IOHUD.com on 
Thursday. “We just need to find her.”

Police finally went and spoke with Bonanno's roommate in the Greenpoint apartment they shared. The roommate told her she'd last seen Bonanno near their apartment, on Freeman Street.

Bonanno moved to Brooklyn in 2012 and became active in the local music scene. The Stormville native also worked at A&E Networks, but was laid off in April. But friends and family say she was still a rather upbeat, happy woman.

'She’s
a very outgoing and positive girl,' friend Daniel Mandelbaum said. 'That’s why we’re 
all so worried. This is completely out of character for her.'

Her mother agreed, saying that simply taking off because she was upset about something 'is not typical of her behavior.'

Greenpoint is relatively safe section of Brooklyn. However, police were searching for a suspect in a sexual assault case in June. In that case, the attacker assaulted the woman at knife-point.

Friends and family have since taken to social media to spread the word about Bonanno's disappearance, and to hopefully generate some tips as to her whereabouts.

Bonanno was part of a group of friends called Supporting 
Our Underground Properly, which helped promote music events throughout the city.

Another member is Liz Rivera, who is the last person to see Bonanno briefly on Monday afternoon.

'We’re
like a family. We’re always together. She would at least contact one of
us,' said Rivera. 'She 
was sad that she was unemployed, but I don’t see her just taking off for
that.'

Rivera added that Bonanno has a cat named Love Song and that she would never leave the cat unattended.
