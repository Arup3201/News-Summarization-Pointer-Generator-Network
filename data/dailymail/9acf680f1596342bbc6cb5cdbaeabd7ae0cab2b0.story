Walkers were warned of the dangers of foraging for wild mushrooms yesterday after dozens of cases of poisoning.

Public Health England said 84 people have been poisoned by mushrooms and toadstools so far this year and the foraging season is only just under way. 

Dr John Thompson, director of the National Poisons Information Service in Cardiff, said: 'People really need to be aware of the very real potential dangers.

Walkers have been warned of the dangers of foraging for wild mushrooms, such as Death Cap mushrooms (pictured), Amanita Phalloides, deadly poisonous  fungi

'It is always at this time of year that we see a noticeable increase in poisoning cases. Many mushrooms growing in the wild are tasty and safe to eat, it is not always easy to differentiate between toxic and non-toxic species even for people with experience.'

Last year, 237 cases of poisoning across the UK were recorded with many involving children under the age of ten. 

The dangers of foraging for mushrooms were highlighted in 2008 when the author of best-selling book The Horse Whisperer was taken to hospital.

Nicholas Evans and three family members had to be put on kidney dialysis after eating toxic mushrooms they had gathered on a woodland walk.

'As the weather starts to change many people will soon be heading out to the countryside to seek out wild food which can be a really fun thing to do,' said Dr John Thompson, director of the NPIS unit in Cardiff. 'But when it comes to wild mushrooms people really need to be aware of the very real potential dangers involved.

'It is always at this time of year that we see a noticeable increase in poisoning cases. This is because while many mushrooms growing in the wild are tasty and safe to eat, it is not always easy to differentiate between toxic and non-toxic species even for people with experience in foraging.

'That's why we say that people should not eat mushrooms collected in the wild unless they are very familiar with the various types that grow in the UK and are sure that the mushrooms that they have collected are safe to eat.'

Dr John Harrison, director of PHE's Centre for Radiation, Chemicals and Environmental Hazards, said: 'People heading outdoors this autumn, whether it's to gather wild mushrooms or just to enjoy the great British countryside, should be aware of the dangers that mushrooms can pose. Correctly identifying the mushrooms that are safe to pick and eat is the key to ensuring that foraging is good fun and does not endanger health.'
