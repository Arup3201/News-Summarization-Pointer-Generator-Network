 

Alastair Cook credited his wife Alice for backing him at his lowest ebb earlier this summer as England celebrated a triumphant 3-1 win over India.

The England captain had been considering his future in June as his side faced defeat by Sri Lanka, but he was all smiles after a feeble India were trounced by an innings and 244 at The Oval.

Asked to name the most important factor in his decision to stick with the job, Cook said: ‘The support of my wife. You can bare your soul quite often to Alice, and she’s very good at getting me back on the straight and narrow.

‘I’m glad I stuck through the tough times.’

Both Cook and man of the series Jimmy Anderson — who finished only three wickets short of Ian Botham’s England-record 383 Test victims — claimed the dressing-room had been helped by India’s insistence on trying to get Anderson banned following his altercation with Ravindra Jadeja at Trent Bridge.

'It's right up there... it's the best I've probably bowled, yeah,' Anderson said of his own form.

He continued on Sky Sports 1: 'The way the whole group has bowled has been outstanding since Southampton.

'We've got on top of their batsmen and not let them get back in any of the games we've played. We've created pressure non-stop.

'That's a credit to all - not just the four seamers, but Moeen Ali as well.'

On what had changed since the loss at Lord's, he said: 'We decided to concentrate not on plans for particular batsmen, but on what we do well - hitting the top as much as we could, challenge their outside edge, challenging their forward defence. And I think as we've gone on through last three Tests we've improved on that in each game.'
