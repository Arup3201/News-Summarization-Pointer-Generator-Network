Leeds are looking at a loan deal for Catania's Albanian striker Edgar Cani.

The 25-year-old forward has spent most of his career in the Italian leagues.

He moved to Poland in 2011 for a spell with Polonia Warsaw which was marred by the team’s severe financial position and repeated fall-outs between the striker and club's officials.

Bristol City are in talks over loan deals for Wolves midfielder George Saville and Wigan right-back James Tavernier. 

The 21-year-old Saville joined Wolves on a permanent deal last summer but the move has failed to work out. 

Tavernier, 23, started his career at Newcastle before joining the Latics in June.
