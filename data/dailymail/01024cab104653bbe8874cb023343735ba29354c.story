A deluxe hotel resembling two half moons on the horizon will be built a mile off the coast of Doha in Qatar at a cost of £1.02billion.

The Silver Pearl Hotel, designed by New York-based firm M. Castedo Architects, is set to have more than 1000 rooms and an adjoining expo centre, has been scheduled for completion ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup to be host by Qatar.

Although it's still awaiting final approval, the remarkable-looking design featuring two 30-storey semi-circle towers will be built and operated by Qatari developer Katara Hospitality.

The £1.02billion development, pictured right, will be connected to the Qatari capital by a four-lane causeway

Between the structures will be a climate-controlled atrium over gardens with a view out to the surrounding ocean.

Other buildings will include a conference and a roof deck above a multi-storey parking facility.

A statement from the designer said the rooms and suites will showcase the country's 'rich cultural heritage and visual traditions' and include a number of restaurants and high-end retail commercial spaces.

The stainless steel and glass exterior will be illuminated at night with LEDs to 'create an illusion of a shimmering pearl glowing in the sea,' the statement continued.

The estimated £1.02b cost doesn't include the interior construction or the building of dining areas and commercial outlets.

A four-lane elevated causeway will be constructed for cars while private yacht and helicopters will also have easy access to the hotel.

The designer said the complex will be positions above the seabed to have as little impact as possible on the marine environment.

'A major environmental consultant with extensive marine experience in the area will be responsible for making sure that lessons learned on existing projects such as The Palm and The World in nearby Dubai are incorporated in the development of this particular site,' the statement said.

Doha is set to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup and is looking to dramatically expand its capacity for incoming tourism

The Silver Pearl is perhaps the most ambitious of a number of projects commissioned ahead of the 2022 World Cup by which the country is aiming to have increased its hotel capacity from about 15,000 to 95,000.

A report by Samba Financial Group fears following the tournament, which has been shrouded in controversy with widespread accusations of corruption throughout the bidding process, the country's tourism intake will struggle to support so many hotel facilities.

'Although the recent growth of the tourism industry in Qatar has been robust, it will be difficult for the country to achieve the level of visitor growth which will garner enough demand to support a 400 per cent expansion in the number of hotel rooms in eight years,' the report stated.
