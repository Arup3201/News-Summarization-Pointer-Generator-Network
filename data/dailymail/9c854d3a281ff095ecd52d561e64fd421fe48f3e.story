An off-duty undercover NYPD cop who denied any involvement as his fellow bikers ripped a father from his SUV and beat him has been seen on video smashing the rear window, it emerged today.

The footage apparently shows the unnamed officer, who is a veteran of seven years, banging on the window and shattering it before the driver was pulled from the vehicle.

The cop then rides away from the scene, sources told NBC. The video, which is being reviewed, is not the same as that which has been widely circulated following the September 29 attack.

Sources added to the New York Post that 
the cop initially told investigators he did not intervene because he 
arrived too late to stop the vicious beating.

Hurt: Alexian Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by 
bikers in New York as he tried to protect his wife and child. It has now emerged that an undercover cop was part of the group that attacked

Smashed: When they come to a standstill in heavy traffic, it takes moments before a biker jumps off and attacks the vehicle, smashing the driver's window with his helmet

The
officer is assigned to the NYPD Intelligence Division, but sources did 
not reveal whether he was on assignment or whether his actions were a 
ploy to protect his cover.

Michael Palladino, president of the NYPD detectives' union, said the undercover officer was forced to make a difficult decision.

'Compromising
his identity could compromise all the work he's doing and his safety as
well,' Palladino told NBC. 'It's very difficult to lead a double life.'

The officer now faces an internal investigation because
he didn't inform higher brass that he was with the bikers, let alone 
the crime scene, until three days after the attack, the Post said.

But
police believe that they cannot press charges against the officer 
because another biker, Allen Edwards, 43, who punched the window of 
Alexian Lien's Range Rover before he was attacked in front of his wife 
and two-year-old daughter, had his charges dropped.

In court: One of the bikers, Craig Wright, was arraigned on Tuesday on charges of gang assault in the attack

Accused: Wright, with his attorney Mitchell Elman, allegedly stomped on Lien three times in the video

Manhattan district attorneyâ€™s Trials 
Division, Karen Friedman Agnifilo said that the city cannot chase 
everyone involved saying: 'Prematurely charging individuals with 
low-level crimes does not further the goals of the investigation and 
could weaken the cases we expect to bring against the perpetrators of 
serious crimes.'

The explosive development came as another biker headed to court over the incident.

Craig
Wright, 29, was arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday and 
ordered held on $100,000 bail, even though his lawyer said he was 
innocent.

Prosecutors 
argued that Wright, from Canarsie, Brooklyn, had been caught on video 
stomping of Lien at least three times after he was dragged from the SUV.

Wright was arrested Monday on charges of gang assault, assault and unlawful imprisonment.

Police
say the bikers swarmed the SUV on a highway and when driver Alexian 
Lien bumped a motorcycle whose rider, Christopher Cruz, had apparently 
deliberately slowed down, several bikers surrounded the SUV and began to
damage the vehicle.

Christopher Cruz, pictured here, could face additional charges, police say

Lien
sped off, plowing into a motorcyclist. Bikers chased the SUV, pulled 
Lien from his vehicle and began beating him in front of his wife and 
two-year-old daughter, police said.

Large portions of the September 29 incident were captured on video and posted online.

Three
other bikers, including Robert Sims, 35, and Reginald Chance, 37, both 
from Brooklyn, have been charged in the incident. Authorities say Sims 
is the man captured on video pulling open the door of Lien's SUV, and 
that Chance was seen using his helmet to bash in the vehicle's window.

Christopher Cruz, faces charges of unlawful imprisonment, reckless endangerment, reckless driving, endangering the welfare of a child and menacing.

Police say Cruz triggered the initial confrontation by slowing down his bike and then going to confront Lien after being bumped. Cruz has denied brake-checking Lien and says he was merely trying to exchange driver information.

Lien has not been charged. The biker he ran over, Edwin Meises Jr., suffered two broken legs and spinal injuries that his family says will leave him paralyzed.

Lien's wife has said her family was in danger and her husband had no choice but to flee the scene.

This comes as Cruz says it's his life that's ruined.

The
28-year-old father of two claims he never intended to box in Lien's 
Range Rover SUV on New York City's West Side Highway - he was only 
changing lanes and looked back to see where his friends are.

Cruz
isn't charged with participating in the horrific six-on-one beating 
that left Mr Lien hospitalized, but police believe that he was trying to
force him to slow down or stop. He is charged with reckless driving and
false imprisonment.

He says the charges and the publicity from the case have ruined him.

'It's turned my life upside down right now,' he told ABC's 'Good Morning America' Monday.

He also denied that he was driving recklessly.

'I had no intentions to slow him down
or to cause any type of problem,' Cruz said. 'I didn't think I was 
doing anything wrong by just cutting into another lane.'

Video from a fellow rider's helmet cam shows Cruz looking back as he changes lanes inches in front of the SUV. Lien then struck Cruz's motorcycle.

After the collision, Mr Lien then panicked and plowed through the crowd of bikers that stopped around him.

Mr Lien called 911 and attempted to flee the bikers, but they chased after him.

When he exited the highway and had to stop for traffic, several furious bikers attacked the SUV, pulled Mr Lien and brutally pummeled him - including stomping on his head.

Scary: The Liens said they feared for their lives

But Cruz says he has no guilt about the incident, which all started with the crash he is accused of causing.

'I don't feel responsible,' he said. 'But I do feel bad for the family that go hurt.'

The New York Post reported this weekend that detectives believe up to six bikers participated in the savage beatdown of Mr Lien.

Kevin
Bresloff, the biker who filmed much of the encounter, says he has 
received death threats from other members of the biker club because he 
is cooperating with police detectives investigating the incident.
