She's regarded as one of soap's most stylish stars so it's no surprise that Lipsy snapped Michelle Keegan up to design a fashion range.

The former Coronation Street star, whose collections have been a stellar success for the brand, is preparing to launch her debut summer range - and she's been hard at work in the design studio to bring fans exactly what they want.

Launching in March, the 27-year-old's new range will be full of crochet, lace, slinky satins and lightweight knits, as well some 'fresh and exciting never-been-seen-before designs'.

Michelle Keegan has shared her fashion mantra as she promotes her upcoming Lipsy range, citing Audrey Hepburn has a classy dresser she loves to emulate 

Actress Michelle, who is currently planning her wedding to Mark Wright, said of her upcoming range: 'One of my favourite parts of summer is being able to experiment with brand new styles and colours. 

'It’s the easiest season to wear fresh statement brights and hot new prints. I also love soft earthy shades such as nude and taupe complemented by sun kissed skin.'

Michelle has taken inspiration from the catwalk, and included lots of the monochrome pieces she loves to wear herself to create a range of swimwear, beach cover-ups and nighttime apparel. 

Michelle advises fashion fans to keep it 'classic and simple' because she's all for 'timeless classic style a la Audrey Hepburn', right

The actress has given fans a sneak peek of what's to come. 

Last night, she attended Lipsy's SS15 press event dressed head-to-toe in her upcoming designs. 

Speaking as she arrived at the event in a casual yet chic ensemble, she said: 'My top tip for day wear glamour is: keep it simple, keep it comfortable and wear key pieces. Whether it’s a statement jacket or a bag. My Lipsy Duster coat was my arrival staple for today’s launch.'

The pint-sized star also emphasised the importance of exuding confidence. She said: 'If you’re feeling unsure about anything you’re wearing, ditch it. You’ll feel out of sorts all day if you don’t give your entire outfit a thumbs up.'

As for her beauty look, the radiant star takes a less is more approach to make-up.

'Keep a fresh-faced feel. With day wear make-up, you can always add to it later in the evening.'

Michelle did exactly that. After leaving the event at London's Ham Yard Hotel, she was whisked across town to the British Heart Foundation Roll Out the Red Ball, and slipped into a little black dress.

Her top three tips for evening glam? 'Choose what you reveal. Show cleavage or leg, never both of them together. I’m big up top so definitely more in favour of showing off my legs.

'Secondly, keep it classic and simple. I love a little black dress and I’m all for timeless classic style a la Audrey Hepburn. Dress for your shape, too. If you’ve got curves, accentuate them. If you’re tall, embrace it.

'Finally, invest in a really good body moisturiser. It really finishes off the look.'

Michelle has recently finished filming on her new TV show, Ordinary Lies, her first major role since quitting ITV soap Coronation Street.

The actress used to play Tina McIntyre on Corrie's cobbles but has switched allegiances to the BBC where she'll portray car showroom receptionist Tracy in the new six-part series.

As well as her career coup, Michelle is looking forward to tying the knot to her man, who previously revealed they are getting married in Norfolk later this year.
