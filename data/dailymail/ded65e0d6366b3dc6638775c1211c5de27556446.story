An American scholar claims to have made a controversial discovery that proves the entire story of Jesus was made up by Roman aristocrats.

Joseph Atwill asserts that Christianity did not start as a religion, but was instead created as a sophisticated propaganda tool to pacify subjects of the Roman Empire.

He says he noticed a pattern forming when he was studying the only surviving account of first-century Judea, which he claims contains dozens of parallels between the life of a Roman emperor and that of Jesus in the New Testament.

Is Jesus really a myth? A Bible scholar claims he has uncovered new evidence that proves the Romans invented the entire life story of Christ

Eureka moment: Joseph Atwill, above left, says he made his discovery
 while studying War Of The Jews by Josephus, which he says 
contains dozens of parallels between Jesus and Roman Emperor Titus Flavius

Mr Atwill argues that these ancient 
'confessions' provide 'clear evidence' that the biography of Jesus is 
'actually constructed, tip to stern, on prior stories, but especially on
 the biography of a Roman Caesar'.

Mr Atwill accepts that his theory will upset some believers but is confident that it will be accepted in good time.

But bible academic Professor James Crossley, from the University of Sheffield, compared Mr
Atwill's theory to a Dan Brown fiction book.

He told Mail Online: 'These types of theories are very
common outside the academic world and are usually reserved for sensationalist
literature.

'They are virtually non-existent in the academic world.'

He also suggested the theories are not taken seriously by experts.

Mr Crossley said: 'People do debate about how much we can
know about Jesus, but the idea that Romans invented stories about Jesus is
outside of the academic world.'

He added that this sort of theory can be 'irritating' to
religion academics.

On his theory, Mr Atwill said: 'I present my work with some ambivalence as I do not want to 
directly cause Christians any harm, but this is important for our 
culture.

'Alert citizens 
need to know the truth about our past so we can understand how and why 
governments create false histories and false gods.

'They often do it to obtain a social order that is against the best interests of the common people.'

The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci: Atwill, who will be presenting his findings at a talk in London later this month, said the Romans turned to subtler ways of keeping order when heavy-handed tactics failed

Atwill, who will be presenting his 
findings at a talk in London later this month, said the Romans turned to
 subtler ways of keeping order when heavy-handed tactics failed.

He
 said: 'Jewish sects in Palestine at the time, who were waiting for a 
prophesied warrior Messiah, were a constant source of violent 
insurrection during the first century.

'When the Romans had exhausted conventional means of quashing rebellion, they switched to psychological warfare.

'They surmised that the way to stop the spread of zealous Jewish missionary activity was to create a competing belief system.

'That's when the "peaceful" Messiah story was invented.

'Instead
 of inspiring warfare, this Messiah urged turn-the-other-cheek pacifism 
and encouraged Jews to "give onto Caesar" and pay their taxes to Rome.'

Law and order: Scholar Joseph Atwill asserts that Christianity did not start as a religion, but was instead created as a sophisticated propaganda tool to pacify subjects of the Roman Empire

'Once those sources are all laid bare, there's simply nothing left,' he added.

He
 says he stumbled upon his discovery while studying War of the Jews by 
Josephus - the only remain first-person account of first-century Judea -
 alongside the New Testament.

He said: 'I started to notice a sequence of parallels between the two texts.

'Although
 it's been recognised by Christian scholars for centuries that the 
prophesies of Jesus appear to be fulfilled by what Josephus wrote about 
in the First Jewish-Roman war, I was seeing dozens more.

'What
 seems to have eluded many scholars is that the sequence of events and 
locations of Jesus ministry are more or less the same as the sequence of
 events and locations of the military campaign of [Emperor] Titus 
Flavius as described by Josephus.'

However, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica, Titus Flavius was born in 39 AD and died in 81 AD.

Estimates suggest Jesus died before 39 AD – 30 AD according to the encyclopaedia.

This was a number of years prior to Titus Flavius’s military campaign.

Mr Atwill continued: 'This is clear evidence of a deliberately constructed pattern.

'The biography of Jesus is 
actually constructed, tip to stern, on prior stories, but especially on 
the biography of a Roman Caesar.'

Atwill said the clues had gone unnoticed all this time because they are coneptual or poetic.

This, he says, was designed to prevent the average believer from becoming aware of what was happening.

They did, however, want the alert reader to cotton on.

Christ Appearing to Mary Magdalene by Titian: Mr Atwill accepts that his theory will upset some believers but is confident that it will be accepted in good time

He adds: 'An educated Roman in the ruling class would probably have recognised the literary game being played.'

Atwill maintains he can demonstrate that 'the Roman Caesars left us a kind of puzzle literature that was meant to be solved by future generations, and that the solution to that puzzle is "We invented Jesus Christ and we're proud of it".'

Atwill does not believe that this is the end of Christianity, but hopes his work will give half-believers a reason to 'make a clean break'.

'We've got the evidence now to show exactly where the story of Jesus came from,' he says.

Roman general Pompey conquered Jerusalem in 63 BC.

Estimates suggest Jesus was born between 6-4 BC, and died around 30 AD.

Roman emperor Titus Flavius was born in 39 AD and died in 81 AD.

The first Jewish revolt occurred between 66-70 AD, the first in a long series of clashes up until 135 AD.

'Although Christianity can be a comfort to some, it can also be very damaging and repressive, an insidious form of mind control that has led to blind acceptance of serfdom, poverty, and war throughout history.

'To this day, especially in the United States, it is used to create support for war in the Middle East.'

Atwill will be giving a presentation on his findings entitled Covert Messiah at Conway Hall in Holborn, London, on October 19, where he is encouraging sceptics to challenge his theory, according to a release published on PRWeb.
