A mailman has taken inspiration from popular children’s cartoon Postman Pat – carrying out his deliveries with a cat companion.

Rudi Saldia rides with cat MJ perched on his shoulder, much to the surprise and joy of fellow road users.

The 25-year-old bike courier and his six-month-old kitten deliver parcels all across their home town of Philadelphia and hope to manage 100 mile rides in less than a year.

The cat and its Pat: The 25-year-old delivery man began cycling with MJ - short for Mary Jane - a few months ago

MJ, short for Mary Jane, is definitely
 not like other cats. Born in a closet drawer in Rudi’s bedroom on April
 Fools, she had an unusual start, and after Rudi discovered her 
favourite spot to rest was his shoulders he decided to train her to 
accompany him to work.

Rudi, a courier for IDS, said: ‘MJ is my first cat and a friend said I could train her - so I got her to sit on my shoulder.’

Having previously allowed his pet Sugar Gliders to ride on his shoulder, Rudy wanted to see how MJ would fare.

‘The first day we managed one block. The next day we managed two blocks and now we can do around 25 miles 
with her on my shoulder.

‘MJ enjoys the wind rushing through her fur and she moves around from shoulder to shoulder.’

Not satisfied with a mere 25 miles, Rudy hopes that he will be able to do 100 miles with MJ by next September.

‘People don't know what to make of it - they always do a double-take.

‘I don't get to see most reactions. 
When I do hear people yell, I typically hear "Oh my God, he has a cat on
 his shoulder! That's so cute".

‘People always come up and want to pet her and are blown away by the fact she arrived via bicycle.

‘MJ is so comfortable on my shoulder she never uses her claws. My shoulder and back are scratch free.’

Daily ride: MJ follows her owner Rudi to work every day and enjoys the speed of the ride - and the attention from passers by

Signed, sealed, delivered: People are often surprised when they notice the feline of Rudi's shoulder  and she gets more than her share of daily cuddles from delighted customers

Surprising sight: Other road users often double take when they see Rudi and Mary Jane on the street

Just like their animated predecessors
 Postman Pat and Jesse the Cat, Rudi and MJ are inseparable and only 
Rudi and his girlfriend are allowed to hold her.

'When I come home she greets me at 
the door and I throw her on my shoulder and walk her up three flights of
 stairs to my bedroom.' Rudi told Daily Telegraph Australia.

British animated children's show 
Postman Pat chronicles the adventures of mailman in the fictional 
village of Greendale where he delivers post accompanied by his 
black-and-white cat Jess.
