Liverpool's £10million striker Divock Origi will have personal revenge on his mind when he meets Everton keeper Tim Howard on Thursday for the first time since their memorable World Cup duel in Brazil.

Origi, on loan at French club Lille who Everton face in the Europa League, missed a number of chances to beat Howard during Belgium’s 2-1 extra-time win against USA in July. Howard made a World Cup record 15 saves to become a hero back home, with even President Barack Obama phoning his congratulations.

The 19-year-old Origi had been substituted by the time Belgium forced a win, but showed enough potential during the tournament to be snapped up by Liverpool when it ended.

Origi starred for Belgium during the World Cup, prompting 

(4-2-3-1): Howard; Coleman, Jagielka, Alcaraz, Baines; McCarthy, Barry; McGeady, Barkley, Pienaar; Eto’o.

Kick-off: 6pm, Thursday, Stade Pierre-Mauroy.

TV: LIVE on ITV4 from 5.30pm.

Referee: Jorge Sousa (Portugal).

‘I had lots of chances to score against Tim in that game,’ said Origi. ‘I had seven or eight attempts but failed. He had a great game and we know how good he is. It would be symbolic to beat him this time.’

An astonishing 7,000 Everton fans, their biggest travelling contingent in Europe since the 1980s, will be in France to see if Howard can torment Origi again.

‘Origi is a good young player, very talented on the ball,’ said Howard.

‘I studied his strengths in Brazil and what he might do. It will be interesting to see him again.’

Everton top Group H after two games but Lille will be a stern test for Roberto Martinez’s side.

Ross Barkley is expected to make his European debut after returning against Aston Villa on Saturday following knee ligament damage.
