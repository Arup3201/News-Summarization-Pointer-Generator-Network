Labour leader: The party is facing more embarrassment over Ed Miliband's plans for a mansion tax

Labour faces more embarrassment over its mansion tax plans after an independent report found council tax reform would be ‘fairer’ and raise four times as much.

Ed Miliband claims his flagship policy will raise £1.2billion a year for the NHS on homes worth more than £2million.

But the Centre for Economic and Business Research says it is ‘improbable’ that they would raise so much.

Instead, it claimed that tweaking council tax bands, which have not changed for 25 years, would be a more ‘progressive’ way to raise revenue.

Adding three extra brackets for high-end properties would generate an extra £4.7billion a year, it said.

Critics say a mansion tax would target pensioners on low incomes whose property has soared in value in recent decades, while also disproportionately hitting people in London and the South East.

The CEBR said that if politicians reformed council tax instead, existing discounts and exemptions would ‘mostly shield’ those on low incomes.

It said: ‘Unlike the proposed mansion tax, a reformed system of council tax does not punitively over-tax a certain group of home owners – those whose homes are valued above £2 million – or a particular region of the country.’ 

The major new report will undermine the policy further and put pressure on the party to consider ‘sensible’ alternatives.

Howard Cox, founder of the Fair Home Tax campaign, which commissioned the study, said the findings showed that Labour was ‘ignoring a fairer approach simply to score ill-informed public support’. 

Mr Cox said: ‘Our report reveals that Labour’s proposed mansion tax is a far less effective revenue raiser compared with a sensible reassessment of the council tax bands.

‘This fairer, more progressive approach to property taxation compared with the proposed Mansion Tax would provide a shot in the arm to local services and the NHS through existing channels, rather than adding more red tape.

‘This report demonstrates that a revised system – with those living in the most valuable houses paying more – would yield billions for local services and the NHS, while reducing the council tax burden for those living in the least expensive properties.’ 

Former Labour home secretary Charles Clarke has already branded mansion tax an ‘absurd proposition’, while Dame Tessa Jowell said she was ‘concerned’ about the effect on the asset-rich but cash-poor.

Labour grandee and former business secretary Lord Mandelson has also backed council tax reform over mansion tax, saying: ‘It will take longer to introduce, that’s true, but it will be more effective and efficient in the long term than just sort of clobbering people with a rather sort of crude, short-term mansion tax.’

Every property in England is in one of eight council tax bands – A to H – based on house valuations from 1991. But since then house prices have escalated. Currently, band A is for homes under £40,000, of which hardly any remain, while Band H is for homes over £320,000.

The CEBR has proposed bands set from A to K, with the lowest band for homes under £85,000 and the highest band for homes over £4million.

Those in band K would be charged £4,493 a year, almost £1,500 more than they pay now, while the average homeowner would pay £167 a year more.

It means the largest homes would be billed four-and-a-half times more than the cheapest, compared to just three times more now.

If politicians wanted to raise a more modest £1.2billion, they could exempt everyone in band A and give discounts to those in bands B and C.

Labour claims the £2million threshold will rise in line with prime property prices.

They also insist that low-income homeowners would not have to pay up front and could instead wait until the property changed hands. 

Labour MP Margaret Hodge, and chair of the influential Public Accounts Committee, cautiously welcomed the report, but was reluctant to criticise the party’s key election proposal.

She said: ‘All political parties have, in an absurd and cowardly way, failed to review council tax bands since 1991.

‘It is ridiculous that somebody whose house is worth £30million is in the same council tax band as someone whose home is £320,000.’

Asked if Mr Miliband should consider council tax reform rather than controversial mansion tax, she added: ‘As we develop our proposals around property taxation we should look in detail at other proposals like this.’

Sir Malcolm Rifkind, Conservative MP for Kensington, said last night: ‘Mansion tax is absurd and ridiculous. It is morally and intellectually indefensible.

‘Even half the Labour party have identified it as a foolish and unworkable.

‘Unlike mansion tax, the proposed reforms to council tax would use an existing system which we already understand and which we know is workable.

‘I do not want to see an increase in taxation in any area because I believe in low taxes. But if it is necessary to do something, then adjusting council tax bands is infinitely more sensible means of doing it than mansion tax.’

He added: ‘It certainly deserves to be looked at whoever wins the election.’

Since council tax was introduced in 1993, ‘property values around England have shifted drastically’, the CEBR said.

A revaluation in England was planned for 2007 but was postponed in 2005 by the Labour government and not looked at again by the Coalition.

Politicians have been reluctant to change council tax bands because it could mean higher bills for homeowners, but the CEBR said it should be revisited.

They claim their proposals would ‘shift part of the tax burden to occupants of very high value properties’ in a fair way.

They estimated that the revaluation of properties across the UK would cost £257million to implement.

Labour claims the £2million threshold will rise in line with prime property prices. They also insist low income homeowners would not have to pay mansion tax up front and could instead wait until the property changed hands.
