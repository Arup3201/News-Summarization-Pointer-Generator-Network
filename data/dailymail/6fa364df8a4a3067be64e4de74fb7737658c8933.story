MERS - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - may be airbone, meaning it can spread easier

The deadly MERS virus which has killed more than 300 people may be airborne, it has been claimed.

Saudi scientists drew the conclusion after finding gene fragments of the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in air from a barn housing an infected camel.

They say this suggests the disease may be transmitted through the air.

This is concerning because viruses that spread through air - such as flu viruses - are 
far more likely to spread swiftly and widely in human populations than 
those that can only move from an animal to a person, or from person to 
person, via direct contact.

MERS, a serious respiratory illness caused by a virus known as a coronavirus (CoV), has infected at least 850 people since it first emerged two years ago.

Of these people, it has killed 32, according to latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

The vast majority of human cases have been in Saudi Arabia, but isolated MERS cases have been reported across Europe, Asia and the U.S.  in people linked who have recently travelled in the Middle East.

Scientists are not sure of the origin of the virus, but several studies have linked it to camels.

Some experts believe it is being passed to humans through close physical contact or through the consumption of camel meat or camel milk.

However, the latest research suggests the detection of the virus in air samples was concerning and needed to be followed up, Reuters Health reports. 

The study was published in the online journal of the American Society for Microbiology, mBio.

For the research, a team led by Esam Azhar, an associate professor of medical virology at King Abdulaziz University, collected three air samples on three consecutive days from a camel barn near Jeddah.

It was owned by a 43-year-old male MERS patient who later died from the disease.

Four of the man's nine camels had shown signs of nasal discharge the week before he became ill, and he had applied a topical medicine in the nose of one of the sick camels a week before experiencing symptoms.

Using a laboratory technique called reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect levels of particular genes, the scientists found that the first air sample, collected on November 2013, contained genetic fragments of the MERS virus.

Several studies have linked the origin of the virus to camels. The conclusions of the latest research were drawn after examining 
air samples of a camel barn belonging to a man who later died from MERS

This was the same day that one of the patient's camels tested positive for the disease, they explained in a report of their work.

The other samples did not test positive for the MERS virus - suggesting short or intermittent shedding of the virus into the air surrounding the camels, Professor Azhar said.

Further tests of the first air sample confirmed the presence of MERS genetic sequences and showed the fragments were identical to those detected in the camel and its sick owner.

He added: 'This study also underscores the importance of obtaining a detailed clinical history with particular emphasis on any animal exposure for any MERS case - especially because recent reports suggest higher risk of (MERS) infections among people working with camels.'

The World Health Organisation and the Saudi Health Ministry have advised camel farm and slaughterhouse workers to take precautions against MERS by ensuring good hygiene, including frequent hand washing after touching animals, facial protection where feasible, and wearing of protective clothing.
