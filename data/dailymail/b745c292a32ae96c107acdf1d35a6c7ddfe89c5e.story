Wearing protective clothing and armed with riot shields, these officers stand face-to-face with angry mobs throwing petrol bombs, bricks and glass bottles.

It may look like a scene of inner city violence, but many of the buildings are nothing but empty shells and the unruly gang is in fact in-character policemen at a fake Kent town.

The officers at the Metropolitan Police Specialist Training Centre in Gravesend practice various forms of public disorder and firearm use and training is intended to prepare them for real-life riot situations.

Photographer James Rawlings was given unprecedented access to the site after several months of negotiations and documented a scene involving 15 policemen pretending to be a mob - antagonising other officers who were acting as the response unit, slowly dispersing and detaining the gang.

Mr Rawlings, who lives in Tottenham, north London, where the 2011 London riots began, was warned that photographing a person's face could put them in danger or single them out when they later came into contact with the public, and had to take pictures from behind or afar.

'The 'mob' aggressively goaded and threatened the officers with physical and verbal missiles - they really took it to a frightening level,' he said. 'There were officers there who'd never experienced this sort of training before, and for them, on street level, I imagine it felt pretty real.'

Mr Rawlings said: 'It was fascinating to observe people "playing at war" in the same way we might play a computer game, but much more physically true to life'

'On shoot day, they had 10 to 15 officers form a mob. This group of officers were completely in character. Obviously, it’s still essentially a form of role-play, but officers glean a very real sense of what these riot situations feel like,' said Mr Rawlings
