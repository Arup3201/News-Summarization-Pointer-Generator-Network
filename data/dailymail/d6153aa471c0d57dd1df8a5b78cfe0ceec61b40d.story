A judge had to leave court while his anger subsided before sentencing a teenage mother who repeatedly beat her baby son and left him severely disabled.

Kayleigh Searle, 19, had slammed three-month-old Thomas against a door, dropped him into his Moses basket and was even thought to have stamped on his head.

She initially blamed her sex offender boyfriend for the horrifying abuse which left her baby with brain damage, but later admitted she was responsible, blaming the ‘stresses’ of being a mother.

Anger: Kayleigh Searle was jailed for eight years for the savage attack on her baby son by Judge Anthony Russell, right, who said the offence angered him so greatly he was forced to spend 15 minutes composing himself before sentencing

After the catalogue of assaults were 
detailed to Judge Anthony Russell QC, he took the unusual step of 
revealing he needed to take a short break to avoid sentencing her in 
anger.

Following a 15-minute adjournment, he returned to court to condemn the 
teenager as ‘heartless and remorseless’ and reject her claim that she 
had struggled to cope.

‘Thomas’s present plight is so distressing that I
felt it necessary to adjourn for some time after hearing the case to 
make sure that I was not sentencing you in anger, for to do so would 
have been wrong,’ he told her.

Jailing her for eight years, he went on: ‘It is almost unimaginable that
a mother could have inflicted such injuries on her own child, and 
furthermore shown no remorse at all.

Jailed: Reece Bourne, 19, was sent to a young offenders institution for three years after earlier pleading guilty to child cruelty

‘Your conduct throughout the inquiry and the case have shown you to be 
completely heartless. You appear to lack even the basic humanity.’

Searle inflicted a series of injuries on Thomas at their Blackpool home,
slamming his head against a door, shaking him and slapping him on the 
back of the head when he began crying.

The baby was taken to hospital last February with a fractured skull, bleeding to the brain and a broken collarbone.

Now almost one year old and being cared for in a hospice, he has 
irreparable brain damage, is blind and suffers considerable pain and 
frequent severe spasms.

College student Searle initially blamed the 
injuries on ex-boyfriend Reece Bourne.

As he had been convicted of 
offences against two teenage girls, she had signed an agreement with 
social services to keep the 18-year-old away from Thomas.

But unbeknown to even her own parents, who lived next door, she let him 
share responsibility for Thomas after deceiving him into believing he 
was the father, the court heard.

However he stood by and did nothing as 
Searle repeatedly beat her child.

After Thomas was taken to hospital last February, Searle claimed Bourne 
had shaken and ‘belted’ the baby. Bourne was arrested and held in 
custody for a day, but Searle later admitted she was to blame.

Searle pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm, child cruelty and perverting the course of justice.

Defending, Paul Humphries told Preston Crown Court she had ‘tried her 
best’ but was ‘young and inadequate’.

But Judge Russell told Searle: ‘I 
don’t think you cared for him at all.’

Bourne, now 19, of Warton,  Lancashire, was sent to a young offenders 
institution for three  years after earlier pleading guilty to child 
cruelty.
