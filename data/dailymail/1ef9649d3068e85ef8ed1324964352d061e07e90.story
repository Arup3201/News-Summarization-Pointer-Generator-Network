A carer murdered a former champion boxer he was looking after - and dismembered his body before using his credit cards to go on a shopping spree, a court heard today.

Thomas Dunkley, 29, allegedly murdered Shaun Cummins, 45, then stole more than £25,000 from the ex-WBA light-middleweight boxer and stored his body parts in freezers at his bungalow.

Dunkley, of Leicester, dismembered the body after killing Cummins and placed the parts in bin bags before sealing them with duct tape and putting them in the freezer, Leicester Crown Court heard.

Death: Thomas Dunkley, 29, allegedly murdered Shaun Cummins (pictured), 45, then stole more than £25,000 from the ex-WBA light-middleweight boxer and stored his body parts at his bungalow

When he ran out of space, Dunkley allegedly went to buy another freezer from a Comet store. He then put down a deposit on a Vauxhall Astra and bought some new clothes, the court was told.

‘He admits dismembering the body but denies killing him,’ William Harbage, prosecuting, said. ‘The prosecution say, having killed Shaun Cummins, he left the body where it was for a few days.

‘It started to decompose and smell. Dunkley embarked on a plan to try and cover up what he'd done in a callous and deliberate way.’

Mr Harbage told the court Dunkley used the former boxer's credit cards to buy a chainsaw, gloves, a mask, overalls and goggles. ‘He set about the grisly task of dismembering the body,’ he said.

Afterwards Dunkley allegedly placed the parts in liners before putting them in the freezer. Mr Harbage asked the jury: ‘Who does that? Who goes to those extremes, unless he's responsible for the killing.’

Mr Harbage said: ‘Having murdered Shaun Cummins, the defendant then went on a shopping spree.’

The court heard Dunkley stole a total of 
more than £25,000 from Mr Cummins's bank accounts and a trust fund set 
up after an accident in 2004.

Dunkley has admitted four charges of fraud relating to using Mr Cummins' credit cards after his death as well as cashing cheques from the trust fund.

He denies two charges of fraud relating to taking out a payday loan in Mr Cummins's name and stealing one of his credit cards before the boxer's death.

Mr Harbage told the jury of seven women and five men that Dunkley had cared for Cummins at his bungalow after the sportsman was left paralysed from the chest down in a road accident in 2004.

Dunkley had given up his job to look after the ex-boxer with his daily tasks involving shopping, giving Mr Cummins his medications and carrying out banking transactions.

Mr Harbage told the jury Dunkley carried out the tasks unpaid and while he did so, his personal debts were increasing. The court heard Dunkley owed around £16,500 to creditors.

‘He certainly had a need for money,’ Mr Harbage told the court.

However Mr Harbage told jurors Mr Cummins was a ‘strongwilled and somewhat overbearing man who seemed bitter about the consequences of his incident’. Dunkley felt bullied and manipulated by Mr Cummins, the prosecutor told the court.

He said one motive for the murder may have been for Dunkley to ‘free himself’ of Mr Cummins and the way he ‘dictated his life’. Another motive may have been for him to ‘get at Cummins's money’, the barrister added.

September 12 last year after concerned nurses who cared for the 
paraplegic contacted the police after they had not heard from Mr Cummins.

Dunkley was arrested at a service station near Wakefield on the M1 in the early hours of the next day. Following his arrest, Dunkley claimed Mr Cummins had died of natural causes and he said he had panicked, the court heard.

However experts who examined the internet history of a laptop found at the house discovered searches asking ‘what happens when you are stabbed in the stomach?’ and ‘how long does it take to die after you are stabbed?’.

'Who does that? Who goes to those extremes, unless he's responsible for the killing'

William Harbage, prosecuting

The court heard the pathologist was unable to determine the precise cause of death of Mr Cummins due the dismemberment and early signs of decomposition.

‘There is an overwhelming inference from the evidence that the defendant murdered Shaun Cummins on September 1 or 2 last year,’ Mr Harbage said.

‘His calculative and deceptive behaviour prevented the discovery of the body. The explanation that Shaun Cummins died of natural causes is simply not true.

‘Rather than call 999 or notify a doctor he panicked and chopped him up with a chainsaw. His actions were intended to mask the true cause of death. He knew the deceased had substantial funds still at his disposal, none of this money had yet come his way.'

Dunkley has admitted a charge of preventing a burial but denies murder. The trial continues.
