A family desperate to lose weight cut out junk food and alcohol and have shed a massive 25 stone between them.

The Kidd/Robinson family were shocked into a healthier lifestyle last year after daughter Lisa Robinson, 32, was told she would be wheelchair-bound for life if she didn’t lose weight.

So the 21-stone 6lbs mother-of-two went to her local Slimming World in Blyth, Northumberland, and slowly but surely the rest of her family followed.

Now with a healthier outlook, and trimmer waists, mother and father Lynda and Les, son David and daughter Lisa are looking to the future.

Full-time mother Lisa said: 'The doctor had suggested I get a gastric band but with the kids I couldn’t go for the surgery so I decided to do it on my own.

'I really needed to do something about my weight, I was in a lot of pain. I wanted to get healthy for my children as it was affecting them as I couldn’t do anything with them and they were suffering.'

Lisa took her mother, Lynda, 56, along to the first Slimming World class and the weight began to fell off straight away, with Lisa losing seven pounds in the first week.

And impressed by their success, 36-year-old David decided to give Slimming World a go.

David, who was a keen sportsman before a back injury kept him off the football pitch said: 'I was 20 stone and 9lbs, my heaviest, when I started.

'I had thought of doing it before, but I thought it was for ladies.

'It was the best decision I ever made going along. My weight was affecting my lifestyle, I was out of breath and could not exercise.

'I am happy with what I am now, 13 stone 9lbs, but ideally I would like to get my BMI down to 25 and that would be losing another nine pounds.

'But it’s great, I can shop in High Street stores and don’t need to go to large men’s outlets.

'I have been back playing five-a-side and I can go down to the gym.'

Retired Co-op worker Les, 58, soon 
joined his family after seeing David’s success and so far has dropped 
from 21 stone to 15 stone 7lbs.

Lynda said: 'It just took a little longer for us to get him there, he thought he was OK.

'It took a bit of bullying to get him there.

'Now
he has so much more energy and he has been able to stop taking some of 
his tablets like the ones for really high blood pressure,

Now
a year-and-a-half after their first class, Lisa has slimmed down to 11 
stone 4lbs, while Lynda has dropped from 13 stone 5lbs to 10 stone 5lbs.

Lynda
said: 'I joined at the same time as Lisa because of her health issues 
and I wanted to support her, she needed someone to be there for her.

'It was not until I started losing weight that I realised how big I was.

'I thought I am putting on weight, but it doesn’t matter at my age, but I was at my heaviest ever.'

Even Lisa’s children Dylan, seven, and four-year-old Caitlyn, have benefitted.

Lisa
said: 'My children follow the plan and with my son having ADHD it has 
helped with his behaviour not having as many additives and sugar and 
they are at a good weight now.'

The Kidd family are now an inspiration to the rest of their class and with David training to become a Slimming World consultant they plan to pass their weight loss tricks on to others.

Blyth Slimming World consultant Jill Heslop, said: 'I am very proud of them all, really chuffed to bits and it does well for the class to see how well they have done.'
