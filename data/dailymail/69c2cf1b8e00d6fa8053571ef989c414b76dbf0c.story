A young widow whose husband was shot dead while out for an early morning walk is talking about her pain and loss 10 months after the tragic incident.

Nathan Trapuzzano of Indianapolis, Indiana, was killed by a 16-year-old with no motive on April 1 while his wife Jennifer was eight-months pregnant with their first child.

'I have to remind myself every day why he is not next to me,' Jennifer said in an interview with WTHR.

And she also wants to make sure her daughter never forgets her father, even though they will never meet one another, so she hung his photo over her crib.

'I wanted a picture where he was looking down over her and that one came to mind immediately. I think that would be perfect. I want her to see him every day. I want her to know who her daddy is. Not only that, I want her to know he is watching over her.'

Now she is also focused on getting guns off the streets, particularly illegal guns, by supporting  Senate Bill 279, which makes carrying a gun an adult offense for anyone over 14 years of age, and imposes harsher penalties amnd jail sentences for threats with a gun or use of a gun.

'I want to start by getting this bill passed, then work from there to start making sure our laws are enforced - because what good is another law if it is not enforced, wrote Jennifer on her website, A Love So Strong. 

'Our police force is doing the best they can and they have suffered this past year too. But there has to be a way out there to get these criminals off of the streets.'

She then added; 'For those who carry guns legally, this will not affect you in any way so long as you use it within the state of the law.' 

Simeon Adams, a 16-year-old nicknamed 'Red' with a long criminal history was charged with Nathan's murder.

Soon after the crime police released security footage of two males following the 24-year-old, before one of them shepherded him into a parking lot between two buildings and killed him.

Adams is alleged to have shot another man just two nights before after they 'bumped' in a steak house car park. Then he was shot in the neck himself on the evening after Nathan’s murder.

Adams wanted to rob Nathan, police allege. But to Nathan's family, what makes his killing even more senseless, is that he never carried anythingof value on his walks.

'I have to remind myself every day why he is not next to me,' said Jennifer

Jennifer is working on passing a Senate Bill that would impose stricter gun laws

Jennifer also revealed Nathan always used to take his daily exercise in the evenings, but fatefully changed his routine that week so he could spend more time with her.

That Tuesday was only the second time he had gone for a walk in the morning. 

‘When he asked me to marry him he said, "I want us both to be saints and for us to go to heaven together, side by side". In his mind our marriage had three people, him, me and God,' Jennifer told DailyMail.com in an interview last year.

‘Nathan actually said I was a better Christian than he could ever be, he said I had a child-like faith, I’m not sure if that’s true, but I never doubted God and this hasn’t changed that. Now I just want to become closer to him so I can see Nate again.’

'Although he has been described as incredibly humble and gracious, Jennifer says Nathan always believed he was destined for something special and was determined to leave his mark on life.'

‘He had told me he thought he was made for great things, not in an arrogant or presumptuous way', Jennifer explained.

‘I’m not sure he really knew what, but he just felt something. He wanted to be a teacher, so he could have an impact on people.

‘In the last few days people have told me they are going back to church because of Nate’s story. He never dreamed that this is how it would end, but knowing people are going back to church and that they have been touched by his story means a lot to me and would mean so much to him.

‘He used to invite so many of my friends to come to Latin mass and when I saw pictures of how full the church was for his funeral, I thought, he finally did it, he finally got them there.’
