A driver fleeing police managed to escape despite flipping his Ford Focus upside down onto a roof.

The man was being pursued after failing to stop for a routine check in Benfleet, Essex, when his black Ford Focus flipped over a grass verge, crashed through a tree and landed on a bungalow.

When the car slid to the ground, the driver clambered out and vanished - despite police 
searching with dogs and a helicopter and saying he may have been badly injured.

Flipped: The force of the impact destroyed the car's tyres and left it on its roof after sliding down off the roof of the bungalow (pictured behind) - but despite being chased by a helicopter, the man evaded capture

Police had chased the man after he failed to stop at around 7pm on Wednesday.

Paramedics were also called and firefighters had to make the bungalow safe after large parts of the roof were splintered away.

Police said they have since visited the driver's home but have still not apprehended him.

Grace Ayres, 83, who lives near the bungalow, said: 'It sounded like a bomb going off.

'Everyone in the street came out to look. A policeman knocked on my door and asked if they could search my garden.'

Bernard Connor, 72, added: 'The car must have been flying. How he got out I do not know. It’s a good job there were no pedestrians around at the time though.'

Evading capture: The driver, possibly injured, escaped through his door before police could detain him

The bungalow was empty at the time of the crash, because the previous occupant had moved into a care home four months earlier.

Another neighbour, photographer Jo Tennant, said: 'It’s pretty shocking that this happened on this road which is usually really quiet.'

A neighbour opposite the bungalow, who asked not to be named, added: 'I just heard it, I didn’t see the car, just heard a great whack.

'Two police cars then went down the road past it, they obviously didn’t know what happened, then they went back and he had gone.'

An Essex Police spokesman said: 'Police are looking to identify the whereabouts of the driver of the car which failed to stop for the police and then he lost control of it and crashed.

Chase: Police used a helicopter and sniffer dogs, but a day and a half later the man had still not been found

'Officers tried to stop the driver of a black Ford Focus which had been driving along London Road shortly before 7pm on Wednesday evening.

'He failed to stop and lost control of the car, flipping it over within minutes.

'The male driver, the only occupant, ran away from the scene. Police searched with the police helicopter scouring the area for the driver who may have been seriously injured.

'He was not found but enquiries are under way to find him.'
