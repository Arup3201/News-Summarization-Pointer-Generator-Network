The Kennedy cousin accused of murder has been forced to remain in jail while waiting for his new trial.

A judge has lifted a stay meaning that Michael Skakel may be granted bail at a later date, but that still leaves him behind bars for the time being.

Judge Thomas Bishop ruled on October 23 that Skakel's trial attorney, Michael Sherman, failed to adequately represent him in 2002 when he was convicted in Martha Moxley's 1975 golf club bludgeoning.

Skakel and Moxley were 15-year-old neighbors in wealthy Greenwich at the time of her death.

In custody: Michael Skakel remains in jail for the time being but may be released on bail while waiting for his appeal trial for a 1975 murder

In removing the stay, Bishop said Sherman's errors were 'substantial and pervasive.' He said he didn't believe Skakel should be required to remain in prison for months or years while his ruling granting a new trial is appealed.

'This case was not a close call for this court,' Bishop said.

Bishop said the case was sad for the victim's family.

Skakel's attorneys want him to be freed while awaiting a retrial, saying that keeping him in prison would be a miscarriage of justice. Prosecutors objected to the request for bond and are appealing the ruling granting Skakel a new trial.

Skakel, the 53-year-old nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel Kennedy, is serving 20 years to life.

He wore handcuffs and leg shackles to court Wednesday and smiled and waved to supporters as he came into the courtroom.

His current attorney, Hubert Santos, had filed a motion seeking a $500,000 bond.

Santos
pushed for immediate bail, slamming the state's case against Skakel and
noting that Skakel's son was only 4 or 5 when he was sent to prison 
more than a decade ago.

'He's entitled to get out as soon as possible,' Santos said, expressing concern that an appeal of the stay decision could take a month or two.

Prosecutor Susann Gill said the state's case against Skakel was strong. Prosecutors argued Bishop doesn't have the authority to grant bond because of an automatic stay of his ruling while they appeal.

Bishop lifted the stay Wednesday but decided he didn't have the authority to grant bail.

'Whatever inherent authority the court may have it's not unbounded, and I believe it's not applicable to this case,' Bishop said.

Gill argued against terminating the stay, saying it would thwart the administration of justice by requiring the state to retry Skakel before an appeal is finished.

'The state is entitled to avail itself of the appellate process and seek vindication of a result it believes to be unjust,' Gill wrote in legal briefs. 

Case: Skakel's case for a new trial revolves around his defense attorney at the time Mickey Sherman, who Skakel has now successfully convinced a judge was 'too enamored with the media attention to focus on the defense'

Thrilled at decision: Robert F. Kennedy Jr spoke to the Today show in his cousin's defense and says he is sure he will be found innocent at the retrial

But Bishop said he addressed that concern by having Skakel agree to waive his right to a speedy trial.

Santos said automatic stays during appeals do not apply to cases like Skakel's and even if they did Bishop has the authority to terminate it.

Skakel 'has been returned to the status of an innocent defendant awaiting trial,' Santos wrote in court papers, adding he was not a flight risk and contends it's 'highly unlikely' prosecutors will win their appeal.

Gill said she disagrees that an appeal likely won't be successful.

Sherman, the trial attorney, has said he did all he could to prevent Skakel's conviction.

Weapon: This photo evidence used at trial shows the murder weapon, a 6 iron golf club that belonged to the late mother of Tommy and Michael Skakel

Martha Moxley was out causing 
mischief on Devil's Night, the night before Halloween, in 1976. She was 
ringing doorbells, spraying shaving cream, throwing eggs, and toilet 
papering homes in her elite gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut.

The last house she happened upon was that of Michael and his brother Tommy Skakel.

She left no later than 11pm, to walk the 150 yards or so to her neighboring house. But she never got there.

Instead, her body was found beneath a tree in her back yard.

She had been bludgeoned with a 6 iron golf club so powerfully that the shaft had shattered.

Martha had been impaled in the neck with a shard from the shattered club.

Her pants had been removed, along with her underwear, but there were no signs of sexual assault.

Tommy
and Michael were initially suspects in the case after it was discovered
that the murder weapon had belonged to their late mother.

Long
believed to have been bungled from the start, many believed police gave
the rich family special treatment in the case and ignored, or failed to
even look for, incriminating evidence.

The Skakels cooperated with the investigation until 1976, then abruptly stopped.

Years of continued speculation about Tommy, Michael, and a range of other suspects followed.

Books
were published on the subject, including one by Mark Fuhrman of OJ 
Simpson trial infamy, but it wasn't until 1999 that the case got any 
more traction.

Clues? Evidence photo from the trial show a 
hallway in the Skakel home, left, and a drop of blood in their driveway,

police investigators of failing to search adequately for clues because 
of the family's prestige

That's when a rare Connecticut one-man grand jury was called to hear evidence for a potential new trial in the case.

Fifty witnesses testified. Reportedly among them were employees and residents
of the Elan School in Poland Springs, Maine, where some claim Michael 
confessed to the murder while undergoing rehab there.

In January 2000, an arrest warrant was issued for Michael Skakel. He soon surrendered to authorities.

After a four week trial, Skakel was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 20 years to life.
