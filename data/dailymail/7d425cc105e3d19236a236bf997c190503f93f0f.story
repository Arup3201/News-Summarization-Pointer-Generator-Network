With grief etched over their faces, Vicki Soto's mourning family today attended the funeral of the beloved teacher who died trying to save her children.

Hundreds of friends and relatives swarmed the church in Stratford, Connecticut to remember the first-grade teacher, 27, with many wearing green clothes or ribbons, her favourite colour.

So many people attended the funeral that scores were forced to stay in an overflow section outside the church as the service was played over loudspeakers.

Soto had taught at Sandy Hook Elementary School for five years before she was shot dead as she tried to shield her students from gunman Adam Lanza on Friday.

She is believed to have hid the 
youngsters in her classroom closet before confronting Adam Lanza, 
telling them the children were at the other end of the school.

Six children panicked and tried to escape but the teacher put herself in
the line of fire so she could save them, but they were all shot 
multiple times. Many of the children survived, yet some did not.

'My sister gave her life to save her kids, and if that's not true strength and heroism, I don't know what is,' Soto's sister Carlee told mourners at the service.

'The expression, "You don't know what you have until it's gone" is true. My best friend is gone.'

Another sister, Jillian, added: 'Over the past five days, people have been thinking of you as a hero, many hoping that they could do the things that you have done to touch the lives of so many, whether it be through your actions on that terrifying morning or through the way that you brought curiosity, excitement and joy to your students every day.

'Each of those are reasons why you 
are in so many people's hearts, but truthfully you have been a hero to 
me for a lot longer than five days.'

She continued: 'Somebody wrote me a 
letter about the recent tragedy that I would like to share with you; in 
it, it said they had to sit down with three small children, explaining 
to them that monsters sadly do exist out there.

'But they felt relief that because of 
my sister, they were able to tell them that superheroes also are very 
real. You are my superhero and I am so proud of you and all you have 
done in your 27 short years.'

After attending the funeral on 
Wednesday morning, mourners also spoke out about Soto's astonishing act of 
bravery in the last moments of her life.

'Mind-boggling what she had to go 
through,' family friend Ryan Ortiz told NBC. 'No matter how many times I
sit at home and think of what I would have done, you just can't imagine
being in that situation.

'In my opinion, she was that light amidst the darkness that was going on
that day in that school. There's really no other way to 
remember her than being that light in that room.'

Soto's sister Carlee was pictured crying as she left the funeral. An image of Carlee howling in pain as 
she learned her sister had been murdered on Friday came to represent the
horror of the killings.

It
was one of the most poignant pictures released by the Associated Press 
that tragic day, and was circulated by media worldwide.

Carlee
later said that the image is a snapshot of the worst moment of 
her life. 'It’s like a reminder of that moment all over again,' she told CBS. 'It kills.'

Soto's
mother, Donna, and other siblings, Jillian and Matthew, were also seen 
wiping away tears as they left the Lordship Community Church on 
Wednesday.

Victim: Victoria Soto had worked at Sandy Hook Elementary School for five years before her death

Loss:  A wake will be held for principal Dawn Hochsprung on Wednesday. On Sunday, President Obama was pictured holding her granddaughter, right, as he attended a memorial service for the victims

Donna previously
told CNN of her daughter: 'She was truly selfless. She would not 
hesitate to think to save anyone else before herself and especially 
children.

'She loved them more than life, and she would definitely put herself in front of them any day, any day, and for any reason.'

Since Soto's death, parents have 
also paid tribute to the caring teacher. The parents of victim Dylan Hockley 
said the young woman was  'warm and funny' and Dylan 'loved her dearly'.

Family, friends and former students also attended a wake for Sandy Hook Principal Dawn Hochsprung,
47, on Wednesday. A funeral will be held for her on Thursday.

She too ran towards
the gunman to protect the children when she heard bullets ring out and 
is believed to have turned on the intercom system so students and 
teachers were warned.

'She had a positive, outgoing, energetic

that's good and positive in the world.'

Arne Duncan, the U.S. Secretary of Education, attended the wake in Woodbury with Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal. Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton also visited.

'Dawn was an absolutely beautiful woman, vivacious and a true gift to the world of education,' Boughton said. 'Her loss is a terrible loss for all the world.'

President Obama held the principal's baby granddaughter at a memorial service on Sunday.

'My mom would be so proud,' her daughter tweeted. 'But not as proud as I am of her.'

Funerals were also held on Wednesday for three more first-grade students - six-year-olds Charolette Bacon and Caroline Previdi and seven-year-old Daniel Barden.
