A jilted lover who staged a sit-in protest on an electricity pylon until his girlfriend took him back was killed by a massive shock as he climbed back down.

Heartbroken Wan Sun had climbed to the top of the steel pylon in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, eastern China, and refused to move until his ex took him back.

But as police brought her to the scene of the drama, Wan hurried down and stepped on a steel support strut while he was still holding onto a high voltage cable and burst into flame.

A police spokesman confirmed: 'The victim died instantly.'

It is not the first time a lover has been electrocuted trying to demonstrate his passion atop an electric pylon in China.

The would-be Romeo attempted the stunt two days after he has split up with his girlfriend in Quanzhou, southern China.

In an effort to win her back, he decided to climb a pylon near to where she worked and cover it in signs declaring his love and asking her to marry him.

But after ascending the metal pylon, he was electrocuted and thrown off into a muddy puddle below.

Witnesses called emergency services and when firefighters arrived on the scene, they found the man's clothes had been virtually burnt off his skin but he was still breathing.

He was stretchered to a waiting ambulance and rushed to hospital. Doctors say he suffered serious burns, but is now out of danger.

Unfortunately, his ex-girlfriend was less than impressed with the stunt, which she called 'stupid' and 'too extreme', and rejected his proposal.
