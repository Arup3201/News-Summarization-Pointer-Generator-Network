A body recovered from the sea off north Wales 30 years ago will be exhumed this month in the hope it can be identified and returned to his family.

The exhumation, from an unmarked grave on Anglesey near Menai Bridge, is part of an attempt by police forces around Britain to put names to more than 1,100 bodies found since the 1950s.

It follows the launch of a website that posts pictures of unidentified dead bodies for the first time - allowing the families of missing people to search for their loves ones.

Found: The family of Michael Sutherland were able to hold a memorial service for him late last year, 23 years after his body washed up on a north Norfolk beach

In November, the Missing Persons Bureau revealed it was launching a new website dedicated to finding the identity of mystery individuals.

It features pictures of bodies, but any images deemed to be distressing are marked with a warning and require confirmation before viewing.

They include a photograph of the arm 
of one body found collapsed in Islington, north London in 2007, easily 
recognisable by the distinctive tattoos of panther and red Indian on his
right forearm.

Another case is that of an infant known as the 
Burythorpe baby, a boy of around 34 weeks' gestation who was found 
wrapped in plastic bags at Burythorpe Bridge in North Yorkshire in 
January 2001.

Forensic tests established he had died two years earlier, but despite extensive inquiries his parents have not been traced.

Many of the bodies have washed up on beaches, unrecognisable as a 
result of being exposed to the elements, or have been discovered on 
railway lines.

Unidentified: The man on the left died after he 
was hit by a train in Hertfordshire in 1995. This man, right, was found 
lying in a makeshift tent adjacent to the A1 in Bedfordshire in 1997. 
Both have never been identified

Tragic: Pictures of unidentified dead bodies will be posted online for the first time - allowing the families of missing people to search for their loves ones. This picture shows the tattoos on the arm of a man found collapsed in a north London street in 2007

Unidentified: This computer-generated image is of a man found floating in the River Lea, near Newham, while the man on the left was found washed up on a riverbank on the River Avon

Some
250 people die on the UK's railways every year, most as a result of 
suicide, according to British Transport police, and a significant number
of these bodies are never identified.

There are hopes that in the coming weeks the man buried in Anglesey 
will join that list after contact was made with the family of a missing 
Norwegian seaman.

The evidence was strong enough for the 
north-west Wales coroner to sign an exhumation certificate, and later 
this month the operation, involving police and forensic experts, will 
take place.

Detective constable Don Kenyon, who is running the 
investigation, said it was a 'rare and sometimes sensitive process'.

'The
circumstances surrounding this man's death are not suspicious – we are 
merely attempting to identify him for his family's sake,' he said.

'That
process will involve carefully obtaining DNA samples and comparing them
against the DNA from individuals we have identified as possible family 
members.'

Search: The bureau has launched a new website which is dedicated to finding the identity of mystery individuals. This shoe belonged to a man who was found in 2003 in the sea, near St. Margaret's Island, Wales

Help needed: This clothing belonged to an oriental man found in the River Thames near HMS Belfast in 1989

Trying to find matches for the corpses against the list of the
missing is also very time-consuming. By law, local councils must cremate or bury unidentified corpses, to 
avoid the risk of disease.

This makes identification far more 
difficult: cremation destroys DNA, while to exhume a buried body,
police must seek the approval of a coroner before any further 
investigation can be carried out.

The graves
are often marked with wooden plaques stating 'unknown male' or 'unknown
female'.

The Missing Persons Bureau published a
report on the number of missing persons and unidentified bodies in 
Britain based on figures provided by forces across the country on the 
number of missing person incidents reported in 2010/11.

In Norfolk, the family of Michael Sutherland were able 
to hold a memorial service for him late last year, 23 years after his 
body washed up on a north Norfolk beach.

When an investigation failed to
identify him, villagers in Weybourne held a funeral service and buried 
him in the churchyard.

But detectives took a fresh look at the 
case as part of their review of unidentified bodies in Norfolk and 
Suffolk, and exhumed the body to retrieve a DNA profile.

Crosschecked 
against the missing persons database, the profile matched that of 
Michael Sutherland.

His sister Ann Stockton, from Cleethorpes, 
travelled to Norfolk last November with other members of the family for a
long-delayed dedication.

The bureau are a total of 1,029 cases of men and women who remain unidentified and 105 babies.

Just six per cent of those involve 
living people, most of whom have been found without identification and 
suffer from a form of memory loss or dementia.

The vast majority of cases - 83 per 
cent - the bureau is desperate to solve involve dead bodies while there 
are still more than 100 unidentified body parts (11 per cent) sitting in
police morgues across Britain waiting to be identified.

with a small 
number of body parts (11 per cent) and unidentified alive people (6 per cent) also still
awaiting identification.

Joe Apps, from the Bureau, told The 
Guardian: 'For us it is about asking how we can be in such a developed 
society and yet have such a large collection of unidentified people, 
when it is actually quite difficult to disappear nowadays.

'So how is it we haven't been able to
recognise these people? There will be a family that is missing someone 
and it is right they know where their loved ones are.'

Members of the public are now able to search the cases and provide information online.

Any relevant details will then be passed to the police or the coroner in charge of the case.

The bureau was unable to give any details of individual cases - other that the ones highlighted here - but a spokesperson said the website had already been significantly slowed due to the amount of traffic it has already received.

The UK Missing Persons Bureau continually work with police forces and the public to try to put a name to these individuals, to enable them to be put at rest and to provide closure for their family and friends.

The Bureau is also running a special project, called Operation Kharon, providing resources to assist police forces to identify their outstanding unidentified people, bodies and body part cases.

Similar websites have been set up in certain states in the U.S, and by police in Belgium and Switzerland.

The Missing Persons Bureau is part of the Serious Organised Crime Agency.
