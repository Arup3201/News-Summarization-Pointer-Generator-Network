Sian Lloyd, pictured, has written a novel about a ferociously ambitious weather girl who will stop at nothing to get on in television

For as long as she can remember, Sian Lloyd has carried a slim black notebook in which she records her daily observations, and the result is a cupboard at home full of scribblings. An innocuous activity, you might think, if a little dull.

But now the weather girl has used her jottings as the basis of a novel in which she intends to lacerate the monstrous egos behind – and in front of – the television cameras.

And as Sian has spent 30 years in TV – more than 20 of them as ITV’s main weather presenter – there are plenty of people who might have reason to be concerned.

‘Some of the sweetest people on TV, male and female, are absolute b******* in real life,’ she says, with an outspoken candour.

‘To be blunt, I’ve been well placed to watch egos at play – and I mean people with enormous, killer egos.’

For those who wondered what had happened to 56-year-old Sian after she disappeared from our screens last February amid rumours she’d been sacked, it’s clear she’s spent some time sharpening her quill.

‘I enjoyed the buzz of working on live TV,’ she says, ‘but when it comes to vanity, pomposity and sheer naked ambition, the television industry has no rival.

‘It has been more than interesting to see what people will do to get on in television and I draw upon all of it in my book.’

The novel – provisionally titled Sunshine And Showers and due out next year – is not exactly autobiographical, says Sian. The plot is based on a ferociously ambitious weather girl who will stop at nothing to get on.

‘I like to think I am far nicer than that,’ she says.

‘But the dog-eat-dog world my character inhabits is not a million miles from the truth, and I can’t be blamed if it sets people guessing.’

Like her fictional heroine, Sian worked her way up the television ladder, starting as a researcher for the Cardiff Broadcasting Company, before moving to the Met Office after a stint with BBC Wales. She joined ITV in 1990.

‘I’ve enjoyed the ride, even if I’ve been left agog over the lengths my colleagues would go to scale the greasy television pole. It is such an insecure business. Everyone is aware there are hundreds of bright young things snapping at your heels.

‘Even so, what people resort to is bizarre. Like make-up being stolen. You will go into make-up, and find your favourite little bit missing, a blusher that you particularly love because it works with the lighting, perhaps. And someone has just taken it… and it’s deliberate.’

Soon after starting on national television, she caught one such make-up thief red-handed. ‘A prominent female presenter, a household name, was rifling through my cosmetics in the green room before a major network light entertainment show,’ says Sian. ‘She was fingering an expensive blusher she was obviously hoping to nobble.

‘Another popular personality was so desperate for exposure that I overheard her asking her agent, without a hint of irony, whether it would be better for her career to support an animal charity or a children’s one. Then there are the mind games. A favourite is trying to throw fellow presenters, standing in their eye line – making a point of standing and watching because there’s nothing worse if you’re on camera.

‘You see big bubbles coming out of their head, full of negativity. Pathetic really – but effective.’

She says the men are little better.

‘I narrowly missed having my bottom groped by a drunken manager at Channel 4 following his Christmas party. I was working and about to step on set. I swerved – leaving him to throw up all over the ornamental coffee table that was part of the set. Seconds later, I was live on air sitting next to a vase covered with vomit.’

‘I know of one married female star nicknamed after a cleaning product because her favourite risque activity was said to involve polishing the boardroom table…

‘I’ve never got up to that sort of thing,’ says Sian, who instead can recount some comically hairy moments on air: ‘Like the time I had to spit my chewing gum out after a producer cut to me unexpectedly.

‘All I could do was turn away and try to discreetly cough it into my hand. But I spat it on to the weatherboard instead, leaving an Everest-style protuberance in the Midlands. I had to keep my hands close to Birmingham and hope no one noticed. They did. The next day, I was offered the chance to front an advert for chewing gum.’ She declined.

Sian insists that most ego maniacs she has worked with will be too self-obsessed to notice her novel. But she is no stranger to the art of a feud, not least with her former fiance, ex-Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik, who lost his seat in 2010.

Opik famously succumbed to the charms of Romanian pop singer and Cheeky Girl Gabriela Irimia. Sian has previously labelled him ‘a fool’ and ‘tedious’, but today she’s in softer mood. ‘Do you know, I genuinely have no idea what he’s doing these days – he seems to have disappeared into a black hole, which is such a shame because he was a very bright person,’ says Sian, who married entrepreneur Jonathan Ashman seven years ago.

‘I generally feel rather sorry for him, which is not me being supercilious because he genuinely could have made a difference. It’s self destructive, really.’

And last year, it was claimed that Sian had been ‘disinvited’ from stepdaughter Suzanne’s wedding to Tony Blair’s son Euan, amid rumours her anti-Iraq War stance was at issue. Professing herself ‘dumbfounded’ at the time, Sian can shed little further light, saying she remains ‘puzzled’ by those events.

On one thing, however, she is entirely clear. She was certainly not sacked by ITV.

‘There was speculation when I left, but I was increasingly getting rid of my shifts or swapping them as I wanted to try new opportunities. My heart was obviously elsewhere so I took the decision to leave.

‘I enjoy working in television, but I couldn’t give a fig if I’m “on TV” or not. I just cared about doing my job properly. I know a lot of people in TV who are still hanging on by their fingertips, and that’s not what I want for me.’
