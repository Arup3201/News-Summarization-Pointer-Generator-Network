A cheeky netball team have stripped off for a calendar to raise money for charity.

Aberdeen University Netball Club braved the elements to create their first charity calendar to raise cash for Cancer Research and their club.

The 19 women received more than 1,000 Likes on Facebook within hours of launching their online fundraising page this week.

Netball club president Lauren Crane, 20, said the women also believed the calendar would be a fantastic way to promote body diversity.

She said: 'We were brainstorming different fundraising ideas for this year and this one kept coming up.

'We thought we could make it a success.

'I was a bit apprehensive about getting my kit off and there were a few other girls who felt the same.

'But it's not all about being a size zero model - everyone is different.'

Brave: Netball club president Lauren Crane said she almost changed her mind on the day of the shoot

Lauren said she almost changed her mind when the day of the photo shoot arrived.

But the netball team soon got rid of their nerves and enjoyed their day.

She said: 'The first photograph took place at 9am and it was down at the beach. In one of the photos we had to run towards the water. It was freezing cold - in the middle of November.

'At first I thought I didn't want to do it, I had changed my mind. Then we took our clothes off quickly and ran and it just felt so good.

'We just got used to seeing each other walking around semi-naked, we got over the fear very quickly.'

The calendars have gone on sale for £5 each and are being sold online and on the university campus.
