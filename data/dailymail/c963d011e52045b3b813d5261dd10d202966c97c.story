Former All Black Brendon Leonard has joined the Ospreys from Italian side Zebre on a three-year deal.

The 29-year-old, who played 13 Tests for New Zealand, will compete for the scrum-half spot with Wales international Rhys Webb from next season.

'I'm really excited to be signing for the Ospreys. The thing that sticks out in my mind after speaking to everybody involved is that it's a club and an organisation with ambition and expectation, excellent facilities and high standards,' Leonard told the official Ospreys website.

'I've got plenty of experience to call on, and I always want to use that to help my team-mates.

'But I'm of the mindset that you never stop learning, wherever you are in life.'

Leonard's last Test for the All Blacks was the 19-12 win over Wales in Cardiff in 2009 and he left Waikato to join Zebre in August 2013.
