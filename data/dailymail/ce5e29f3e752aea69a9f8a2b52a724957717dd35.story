A female referee was left ‘in floods of tears’ at a youth football match after a player’s father launched a 30-second tirade of sexist abuse at her, telling her to ‘get her handbag and go home’.

Shelby Davis, 21, called off the game in response to the sexist comments, made at half-time in a Youth Cup game between the Wyvern Youths and Pirelli Pirates Youth in Southampton.

The abusive man was reportedly the father of a Pirelli Pirates player, and the team is now facing a disciplinary hearing after the matter was reported to the FA.

Shelby Davis, who has been referring for seven years, abandoned a football match after sexist comments were made towards her by a spectator

The Pirates were losing 2 goals to nil at the time of the astonishing outburst.

Miss Davis, who has been refereeing for seven years, said: ‘I reported the matter to the Hampshire FA. I hope the dad will be disciplined.

‘I abandoned the match for sexist comments made towards myself by the dad.

'I regarded it as being very offensive. They lasted about 30 seconds.

‘I was standing by the dug out at half time after I had blown the half time whistle.

'The spectator was standing at the other side of the pitch.’

Ryan Andress, the manager of the Wyvern Youths team whom the Pirates were playing, said: ‘Shelby was in floods of tears. She was crying and everything. She took it to heart and could not take it any longer.

‘It was appalling, it was disgraceful. I am ashamed at what happened.

‘The dad shouted at her “you are a female you should not be involved in football - go and get your handbag and go home.”’

Len Lacey who founded Pirelli Pirates in 1996 and is currently the secretary yesterday said: ‘I know who the spectator is.’

‘We will be requesting a personal hearing. If this is the truth it is absolutely disgusting.’
