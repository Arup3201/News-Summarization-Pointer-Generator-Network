A teenager accused of planning a repeat of the Columbine massacre 'glorified' the leader of the English Defence League (EDL), a court has heard.

The 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is on trial accused of stockpiling weapons for a terror attack on his former school in Loughborough, East Midlands.

His sixth-form college, a local mosque, Loughborough University, a cinema and council offices were also named as potential targets, it is alleged.

The teenager, whose identity is hidden in this artistic drawing, idolised Hitler and former EDL leader Tommy Robinson, a court has been told

The Old Bailey was told that the boy told police officers he was 'experimenting' when they uncovered a stockpile of weapons in his bedroom. 

Jurors at the Old Bailey were shown weapons recovered by Leicestershire police officers, including air rifles, knives, a crossbow and a machete, after they searched his bedroom in February.

Officers had been called to his home address following reports the teenager had threatened two schoolboys with a knife, the court heard.

After police entered his bedroom, he said 'I carry the knife for my own protection', the jury was told.

After handing over two knives kept in two different coats, he added: 'I better give you these. I've been experimenting.'

Police recovered a number of weapons including a knife with a Swastika and the words 'blood and honour' inscribed, a machete with a £12.95 price tag attached, three throwing knives, a green ammunition box, a number of air rifles, BB guns, a crossbow and a gun holster, the court heard.

A manager of a local clothes store said the defendant spoke about Tommy Robinson, who resigned as EDL leader yesterday

A newspaper cutting on the number of U.S. deaths in the war on the Taliban as well as stories on an alleged racist text by British National Party (BNP) leader Nick Griffin and on gun crime in Liverpool were also shown to the jury.

The court has previously heard the teenager allegedly wrote in a Che Guevara notebook emblazoned with Swastikas his plans for The New Columbine.

Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered 12 students and one teacher at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999 in one of America's worst mass shootings.

Edward Roe, the manager of the Irish Clothing Company store in Loughborough where the teenager bought military clothing and accessories, said he knew the boy held far-right wing views.

In a witness statement read to the Old Bailey jury, Mr Roe said the alleged terror plotter had spoken about former EDL leader Tommy Robinson, who resigned from the far-right group yesterday, and ordered a t-shirt with am 'German SS' badge.

'We had a conversation with regards to the EDL, which I know stands for the English Defence League,' Mr Roe said.

'I believe they incite hatred against different races and creeds, Asians in particular.

'He talked about Tommy Robinson who I have heard of but I don't know who he is,' he continued.

'I didn't want to talk about this kind of thing. I think he was glorifying Tommy Robinson, whoever he was.

'He also tried to order a Death Skull t-shirt. This is a large German SS badge that would be worn on the collar.

'This is not an item that the shop would stock or be associated with. I told him it wasn't something we would stock.'

Angela Martin, another manager at the shop, said the defendant had told her in January that he thought it was OK to carry a knife, before adding: 'If I could I would kill someone.'

She told the court the teenager had allegedly previously bought a t-shirt with a Taliban slogan and ordered a stab vest.

The 17-year-old boy is on trial at the Old Bailey, accused of stockpiling weapons for a terror attack on his former school in Loughborough, East Midlands

The court also heard from a schoolboy 
who claimed the defendant threatened him with a knife after a 
confrontation outside a shop.

In
a police interview played to the court, the boy said the defendant 
swore at him and his friend in the street as they threw cans around.

After they confronted him, the teenager pulled out a knife, the boy said.

'I thought I was going to die,' he said. 'I wanted to cry.'

The boy, who can not be named, said he was 'skimmed' by the weapon as he crouched down to pick up his scooter.

'It looked really sharp,' he told police. 'He was aggressive, he wanted to do it.'

The
defendant, who has Asperger's syndrome, denies a charge of possessing 
items for the purpose, preparation and instigation of an act of 
terrorism.

Targets were alleged to include Loughborough University and five other sites in the area

They include nine
partially assembled petrol bombs, a quantity of commercial firework 
powder, a quantity of part-assembled pipe bombs, partially constructed 
improvised explosive devices (IEDs), quantities of commercial 
pyrotechnic fuse cords, a stab proof vest, a gas mask, three 0.22 air 
rifles, one Olympic 0.22 blank-firing pistol and a quantity of 
ammunition, one 0.22 air pistol, three BB guns, a black military belt 
containing air gun pellets and a silver cartridge, and one note book 
containing information about the planning and construction of explosive 
devices, it is alleged.

The 
boy also denies one count of possessing a document or record containing 
information likely to be useful for a person committing or preparing an 
act of terrorism, and a further count of possessing explosives in the 
form of component parts of IEDs.

The
teenager and two other 17-year-old boys have already pleaded guilty to 
two charges of possessing petrol bombs and component parts of pipe bombs
for the use of explosive devices.

The
defendant, dressed in a black T-shirt and wearing glasses, has been 
sitting in the dock with an intermediary throughout the court 
proceedings.

The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
