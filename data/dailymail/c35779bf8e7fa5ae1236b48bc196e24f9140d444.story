European human rights judges are poised to order that millions of pounds be paid to Serbian conscript troops who fought in a war of ethnic cleansing.

The soldiers’ claims for pay for their part in the four-month war against Nato and British forces some 14 years ago will be heard by the appeal chamber of the European Court of Human Rights later this month.

The decision of the Strasbourg judges to hear pay claims from troops involved in the Kosovo war - described by a UN war crimes court as a ‘criminal enterprise’ - was condemned by Tory MPs as ‘bizarre’ and ‘lunacy’.

It comes at a time when David Cameron has threatened to suspend Britain’s membership of the European court over the continued blocking of attempts to deport terror suspect Abu Qatada to his native Jordan.

British judges stalling the Abu Qatada deportation have been following human rights ground rules laid down in Strasbourg.

The Serb conscripts’ case will go to a hearing at the Strasbourg court’s Grand Chamber later this month.

A lower tier of the court has already ordered the Serbian government to pay thousands of reservists and conscripts who were called up to fight in the war, but were never paid the daily allowances they were promised.

The conscripts were drafted in February and March 1999 to fight in Kosovo at a time when strongman leader Slobodan Milosevic was trying to enforce ethnic Serb domination of his Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

They fought against an ethnically Albanian resistance army in the one-time province of Yugoslavia while British and Nato warplanes bombed the Serb capital Belgrade and Nato land forces, including the British army, assembled to help the Kosovans.

The war ended with Milosevic ordered his troops to withdraw in June 1999.

The UN International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has ordered jail sentences for a number of Serb generals and leaders who headed the conscript army.

It ruled in 2009 that the war involved ‘a campaign of terror and violence directed against the ethnic Albanian population’.

The conscripts were drafted in early 1999 to fight in Kosovo at a time when leader Slobodan Milosevic (above at a war crimes tribunal in the Hague) was trying to enforce ethnic Serb domination of his Federal Republic of Yugoslavia

It said the attempt at ethnic cleansing ‘was to be executed by criminal means, including deportations, murders, forcible transfers and persecutions of Kosovo Albanians.’

The UN tribunal added that the army into which the reservists were called was responsible for ‘mass expulsions of Kosovo Albanians from their homes, as well as incidents of killing, sexual assault, and the intentional destruction of mosques.’

It said that between March and June 1999 at least 700,000 ethnic Albanians were forced out of their homes.

However the European Court of Human Rights held in its initial hearing that Serb conscript troops were the victims of human rights abuses.

Strasbourg judges have not considered the actions of the soldiers during the war.

They said that the conscripts have suffered discrimination because the modern Serb government has paid the allowances to some troops drafted from the country’s poorest towns, but not others.

The European judges ‘concluded that there had been no objective and reasonable justification for the applicants being treated differently merely on the basis of their place of residence.’

The Grand Chamber hearing later this month will consider ‘the payment of allowances to all reservists who served in the Yugoslav Army during the Nato intervention in Serbia between March and June 1999'.

Failure to pay the reservists caused discontent and rioting in Serbia even before the end of the 1999 war and was a key factor in the uprising that deposed Milosevic from power in 2000.

Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘This is bizarre. The Kosovo war was about the principle of national self-determination, yet now the unelected judges of the European Court of Human Rights see fit to interfere in the opposite direction.

‘There cannot be many things which would make most people feel sympathy for the Serbs, but this lunacy must be one. It stretches any credibility of the European human rights court.’

The Strasbourg court holds jurisdiction over 47 countries that are members of the Council of Europe. Serbia joined after the fall of Milosevic, becoming the 45th member in April 2003.
