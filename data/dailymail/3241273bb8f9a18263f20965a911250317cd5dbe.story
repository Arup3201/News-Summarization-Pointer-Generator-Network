Christmas decorations including wrapped presents have been banned at Sydney train stations for the first festive season since Australia's terror alert level was raised to high.

Travellers at some of the city's most trafficked stations are missing trees, stockings and tinsel due to fears over items that could be hidden amongst decorations, the Daily Telegraph reported.

'With the country on a high terror alert, you can't have Christmas stuff like wrapped boxes lying around all over the place,' a NSW government source told the Telegraph.

'It makes it more difficult to check the public areas at stations for suspicious items.'

Stations are instead being decorated with paper posters that say 'Merry Christmas', 'Season Greetings' or 'Happy Holidays'.

A Sydney Trains spokeswoman said: 'There will be lots of Christmas cheer across the train network. 

'Two big Christmas trees are going up at Central Station, decorations are being rolled out at busy stations and posters wishing everyone a merry Christmas will be at all our stations. 

'Sydney Trains wishes all our customers a Merry Christmas.'

At Sydney's busiest train station - Central - two Christmas trees will be put up on Thursday, just two weeks before the big day.
