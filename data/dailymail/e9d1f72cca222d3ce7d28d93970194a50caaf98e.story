The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance has found a new front man against the United Progressive Alliance -  Baba Ramdev.

The yoga guru is currently protesting against the United 
Progressive Alliance Government's alleged inefficiency in tacking black 
money and corruption.

Ramdev's agitation during at sit-in at the Ramlila Maidan turned into an extended NDA gathering with BJP president Nitin Gadkari, Janata Dal- United chief Sharad Yadav, Janata Party supremo Subramanian Swamy, BJP leader Vijay Goel and representatives from the Shiromani Akali Dal joining him on the dais.

Ramdev, the pied piper of the assembly, played his own tune against the Centre, particularly the Congress, as his followers cheered with a renewed vigour.

'This protest is to ensure that no dishonest person enters Parliament. Such people should be boycotted. We do not have a political agenda. Congress hatao, desh bachao.' Ramdev declared.

The dwindling support for Ramdev at the Maidan soared yesterday as the political leaders came in with their own squad of agitators to the venue.

Ramdev’s platform gave the BJP an opportunity to make common cause with some of its former allies such as the Telugu Desam Party ( TDP), the Biju Janata Dal ( BJD) and the Asom Gana Parishad ( AGP), whose representatives were also present at the ground.

Gadkari assured Ramdev full support of the BJP in his agitation against black money.

'This agitation should not be seen from a political prism. This is an agitation of the people of the country and not of a single party. Black money should be brought back and spent on the country’s development,' he said.

An unexpected bonus for the Baba came in the form of support from the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, which are supporting the UPA from outside.

The fusing together of the Opposition parties around Ramdev is the product of a series of meetings that took place between the yoga guru and leaders of the BJP.

Full capacity: Crowds surround the yoga guru

Ramdev had a closed- door meeting with Gadkari on the eve of his agitation that began on August 9.

He conducted further discussions with Gadkari, L. K. Advani and Arun Jaitley in another meeting.

In July, a prominent lawyer- politician facilitated a meeting between Ramdev and Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi in Ahmedabad.

Buoyed by political support, Baba Ramdev has dug his heels in at Ambedkar Stadium, where he has been lodged with his supporters, and has refused to leave despite the police deciding to free him.

Ramdev said he would stay there the night and decide the next course of action later.

This has given the Delhi Police a headache as they need to sanitise the area because Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will pass through it on August 15.

The police brass briefed the Union home ministry on Monday evening even as they continued their efforts to persuade Ramdev break his fast and leave.

However, the yoga guru has stumped the police by demanding that they provide food to all his supporters if they wanted him to break his fast.

Earlier, despite deploying a large number of security personnel, the police had a tough time controlling the yoga guru and his supporters as they marched towards Parliament.

After fiveand- a- half hours of high drama, they were finally detained under Section 65 of the Delhi Police Act, which is a preventive measure.

Wiser after the flak following the midnight crackdown on Ramdev’s fast last year, the police were restrained this time.

'The BJP’s calculation was simple. As Ramdev has some following in smaller towns as well as in the urban middle class, supporting him would benefit the party,' said a party source.

What worked for the BJP was that Ramdev, unlike Team Anna, had no qualms in aligning with the party and, more importantly, had no plans of launching a political outfit.

Moreover, it was easy for the BJP to back the yoga guru on the black money issue as it had earlier been raised by Advani.

Ramdev on his part, needed the Opposition’s political backing to avoid an embarrassing end to his agitation like the Ramlila Maidan fiasco last year.

The support of parties such as the TDP, the Akali Dal and the BJD was largely the result of Ramdev’s meetings with Naveen Patnaik, Chandrababu Naidu, and Parkash Singh Badal in June.

He also met Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar.

The Sangh’s hand in shaping Ramdev’s agitation has been known for some time.

The seeds of the protest at the Ramlila Maidan last year were sown in a meeting in early 2011 at the Vivekananda Foundation in south Delhi. The meeting was attended by Sangh ideologue K. N. Govindacharya, Swadeshi Jagran Manch chief Swaminathan Gurumurthy, Subramanian Swamy and Ramdev.

This was part of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s effort to “ consolidating splinter movements”. Sources said it has been Gadkari’s gameplan to get Ramdev, Swamy and Govindacharya to play a more active political role, perhaps in order to provide a counterweight to “ Delhi- based” leaders of the BJP as well as to maintain the ideological dominance of the RSS.

The coordination between the BJP and Ramdev was perfect as party MPs created a ruckus in the Lok Sabha on Monday on the black money issue.

At the Ramlila Maidan, Ramdev, who had been postponing his “ big announcement” since Friday, finally blew the bugle on Monday morning, asking his supporters to get ready to court arrest.

Around 1.15 pm, the yoga guru began his march towards Parliament with thousands of supporters.

The cavalcade, however, could not move beyond 300 metres and about 10 minutes into the march, it was stopped by the police near the Ranjit Singh flyover.

Soon it became clear that Ramdev had been detained and was being taken to Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in Bawana on the outskirts of the city. “ Delhi Police is a puppet in the hands of the central government. We will not do anything that disrupts peace,” Ramdev told his supporters.

The police had a tough time making their way through the crowd.

Even the rains could not move the supporters away. It was only around 6 pm that the buses carrying Ramdev and his aides left. SINCE the number of protesters was large, the police decided to take Ramdev to Ambedkar Stadium near Delhi Gate. Now, he is camping at the stadium.

This has triggered another security issue as the Ambedkar Stadium falls on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s route to the Red Fort where he will hoist the national flag on August 15.

Ramdev has not yet announced his next course of action but a member of his team said they would present a memorandum on black money and corruption to President Pranab Mukherjee on Tuesday.
