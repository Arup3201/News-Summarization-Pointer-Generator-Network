Scientology is heading for Harlem - with its new home to be located in a towering, multimillion-dollar brownstone slap bang in the middle of the neighborhood. 

The Church of Scientology and Community Center of Harlem, New York is part of an alleged mission to infiltrate new areas, targeting potential members who may not have heard some less than savory rumors about the organization.

The building at 220 East 125th St, Dr Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard is set to open in the first half of 2014.

A Church of Scientology International spokesperson told MailOnline: 'The Church of Scientology and our volunteers have been extremely active in Harlem for decades.

'And so it has been both the demand from parishioners as well as the community that we increase our work in Harlem. This brand new Church of Scientology and Community Center Harlem enables us to do so.'

They did not reveal the cost for purchase of the building or the renovation.

A spokesperson added that the center will be an 'Ideal Church of Scientology' - meaning provides full services of the religion.

At the Harlem center will be a chapel for 200 people, a public information center and a dozen classrooms.

There appears to be a move by the organization to add to its plethora of glitzy centers in places such as Silicon Valley, Orange County and Los Gatos, California with buildings in poorer, crime-ridden  areas.

Critics suggest that the plan is to tap into parts of society that may be less aware of the negative associations of Scientology -  including reports of mind control and enforced manual labor by the church.

Scientology has had a number of 
troubles recently. Last month, actress Leah Remini defected from the 
church and stirred controversy. The
 King Of Queens star reported that the organization turned friends 
against her and she filed a quickly-dismissed missing persons report 
about leader David Miscavige's wife.

Andreas 
Heldal-Lund, who runs anti-Scientology website Operation Clambake, told the New York Daily News: 'Scientology
 is losing people. They are focusing on recruitment.

'They
 are trying new avenues to find people who will pay for their truths.'

Scientologists
 turned out in their thousands to herald the opening of a new center of 
Scientology in Inglewood, California back in 2011 - an area troubled by 
violent gang culture. 

The Harlem Scientology center is due to open in 2014, as part of an aggressive construction schedule for centers of worship.

Also on the schedule are centers in Albuquerque, Battle 
Creek, Michigan; Boston, Chicago, Columbus and Philadelphia.

Scientology, which was started in the 1950s,
 is continuing its spread throughout the world.

Centers are planned for Cape 
Town, Durban and Harare in South Africa, Toronto and Montreal in Canada;
 Bogotá in Colombia; Caracas in Venezuela, Copenhagen in Denmark; Sydney, Australia; Kaohsiung, Taiwan and Manchester, England - among many other large cities.

Scientology centers are not the only construction being planned in the organization.

MailOnline exclusively revealed this month photos of the Church of Scientology's 'alien space cathedral' built in a remote part of the New Mexico desert.

The mysterious building leads to an underground vault which sits next to two giant symbols carved into the ground - believed to be markers for the religion's followers to find their way back from the ends of the universe after humanity is destroyed in the future. 

While no one knows the definite meaning of the pair of overlapping circles, each with a diamond in them, it is believed to have been trademarked by the Church of Technology, a branch of Scientology.

It is believed that they are a ‘return point’ so members of the church know where they can find the works of founder L. Ron Hubbard when they come back from space after a nuclear catastrophe wipes out the human race.
