Greece was threatened with expulsion from the European Union for at least a decade if it dared to press ahead with a referendum on the single currency rescue deal, it emerged last night.

On a day of drama worthy of the Greek stage, prime minister George Papandreou hovered between defying Brussels, resigning and forming a new government of national unity.

A vote of confidence, expected at around 10pm tonight in the Greek parliament, could yet see the present government collapse.

Last night it was still not entirely clear what the Greek government has decided to do – though it is certain that Mr Papandreou has been cowed into calling off his proposed referendum.

Extraordinary details then emerged of how German Chancellor Angela Merkel threatened the Greeks not only with an end to bailout cash and ejection from the single currency, but also expulsion from the EU for at least ten years.

But hopes in Brussels that a new coalition government led by someone other than Mr Papandreou could be installed were scuppered when the opposition insisted it would not join such an administration and instead demanded elections within six weeks.

Mr Papandreou had horrified other EU leaders days ago by announcing that he would seek popular support for an agreement that would see half of Greece’s towering debts written off in return for a decade of deeply unpopular austerity measures.

Pension payments are being slashed by 20 per cent, VAT has been hugely increased and a new property tax is being introduced.

But economists argue the debt write-down is not dramatic enough to offer Greece any hope of emerging with a stronger economy.

Defiant: Greece's prime minister George Papandreou speaking in parliament yesterday, when he insisted he was the right man for the job

Last night the Greek prime minister suggested he would be ready to drop a referendum on the bailout deal, as long as he could secure opposition support in Parliament.

‘If we had a consensus we wouldn’t have to go to a referendum,’ he said. ‘If the opposition is willing to negotiate then we are ready to ratify this deal and implement it.’

However, Mr Papandreou said the government was not afraid of asking the Greek people for their opinion in a referendum if necessary.

Germany and France, fearing the single currency could collapse if the Greeks voted ‘no’, had already threatened to cut off existing cash lifelines for Athens until the vote was held.

They also insisted any referendum must be on the country’s future membership of the EU and eurozone, rather than a more narrow question relating to deeply unpopular austerity measures, to maximise the chances of a ‘yes’ vote.

And as the day went on, their threats escalated – culminating in the suggestion that Greece would not only have to ditch the euro and reinstate the drachma unless it supported the rescue deal, but also leave the EU.

Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson said Greece was ‘clearly going to fall out of the eurozone’. But former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling insisted the eurozone bailout deal had unravelled and said throwing Greece out of the single currency is ‘not going to solve the problem’.

He said: ‘The real problem is that the Greek fix was never going to work. Even if it had worked, it was still going to be left with a debt of 120 per cent of its GDP and that doesn’t work.

‘The deal that they were being offered should never have been on the table.’

In a lengthy speech to the Greek parliament, Mr Papandreou declared: ‘For the last two years we have waged a battle of titanic proportions. Our first duty being to fend off bankruptcy, to prevent the country collapsing. We were a guinea pig in a monetary union.

‘We are bearing a cross and, on top of that, they are throwing stones at us.’

He attacked Mrs Merkel and French president Nicolas Sarkozy for publicly humiliating Greece by ‘telling us how to hold our referendum, defining the rules’.
