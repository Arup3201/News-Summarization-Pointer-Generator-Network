After a legendary fall-out over food and fitness a year ago, Kate Moss and Gwyneth Paltrow have buried the hatchet â€“ over a slice of pizza.

Their argument began at Sir Philip Green's 60th birthday party in Mexico last May.

According to witnesses, Kate, asked Iron Man actress Gwyneth why she was jogging on the beach.

Mother-of-two Gwyneth was reported to have fired back: 'So I don't look like you when I get old.'

An apoplectic Kate threw a handful of crisps at her, yelling: 'Eat some f*****g carbs!'

Ironically, it was carbohydrates that reunited Kate, 39, and Gwyneth, 40, last week when they crossed paths at a smart North London pizza restaurant owned by the Soho House group and famed for its hog roast pizzas and macaroni cheese.

'Gwyneth was at the Pizza East Kentish Town with husband Chris Martin, and their kids Apple and Moses, celebrating Apple's ninth birthday with some of her friends,' a fellow diner reveals.

'As Gwyneth was about to leave, Kate waltzed across from the other side of the restaurant to say hello.

They exchanged kisses and chatted for about ten minutes. Kate's husband Jamie Hince also came over and everything seemed really friendly.'

Kate Moss was also seen tucking into a snack alongside husband Jamie Hince as the couple went for a stroll in Hampstead.

They stopped by a stall which was recently visited by Hollywood A-listers Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher.Model Kate looked like she couldn't get enough of her filled treat as she scoffed the French pancake walking through the streets.
