Ariana Grande has hit back at reports she left an Australian photo shoot in a huff on Tuesday, saying she actually went to change her clothes because she didn't like her top.

Speaking to Mike E and Emma on 96.1, the 21-year-old popstar called the claims 'untrue'.

'It was just a photographer who got mad at me because I left to change my outfit mid photoshoot because I didn’t like my top,' she told the radio show.  'I was like, "Oh I’ll be right back!" and I came back and he had left.'

Ariana was rumoured to have stormed off from her first photo shoot in Sydney on Monday after giving photographers an endless list of demands and telling journalists they couldn't ask certain questions.

But she said a simple costume change was all there was to it.

'[The photographer] said all these ridiculous untrue things about me,' she said.

'That’s not real. That’s nonsense.

'No matter what you do, no matter what your profession is, no matter how old you are, everybody deals with haters.'

Talent manager Scooter Braun, who discovered and managed Justin Bieber as well as Ariana, also weighed in.

Ariana, who confirmed she would tour Australian next year, said she had been looking forward to coming here for a long time

Her antics didn't seem to phase her or the hundreds of adoring fans that turned up to see the popstar as she performed live on Channel Seven's Sunrise program at Sydney's Martin Place early on Tuesday morningAriana, who is in Sydney to promote her album My Everything, performed her hit song Problem in a black one-piece paired with thigh-high boots and a pair of cat ears perched atop her head.

Following her performance she spoke to the show's hosts Sam Armytage and David Koch as she kept an eye on her screaming fans outside the studio.

'I've been looking forward to coming to Australia for a long time - I haven't had enough time though,' she said.

The American star, who collaborated with Iggy Azalea on Problem, also said she's a huge fan of the Australian rapper.

'I love Iggy, she's very talented I love her music and I was honoured that she wanted to do a song with me.'

Just a day earlier Ariana was reportedly displeased with the way she looked on camera and she stormed out on a string of media commitments scheduled to promote her new album.

The first photographer of the day had been handed a list of demands, including 'only to shoot the left side' of Ariana's face, and not to use 'natural light.'

Media were also handed a no-go list, guiding the  line of questioning, according to news.com.au.

The list reportedly stated that Miss Grande could not be quizzed about topics including her love life, Mariah Carey, Justin Bieber and her recently-cancelled Nickelodeon program, Sam & Cat.

Ariana's entourage then sent the rest of the snappers home empty-handed even though photographers and journalists had been left waiting in a hotel room for an hour.

The popstar eventually re-appeared to answer questions wearing a short navy and gold sequined skirt and black top.

When asked if she had any plans to work with Australian rapper Iggy Azalea again, her collaborator on global hit Problem, she replied: 'I just put out this album, slow down a little... I'm just kidding.'

The young star has been in the spotlight since she was 14 - as an actress in two Nickelodeon TV shows and with her music career.

Ariana said she works hard to protect herself from negative comments.

'I've made it so I don't really have to deal with it. I've sort of created a very safe happy little bubble that I live in where I don't really hear about those things, or look at them, or read them or see them for that matter,' she said.

And it seems she attempts to stay in this bubble.

'I've tried to make a very definite separation between my real life and, then, that other stuff. So I don't really let that into my bubble, for lack of a better analogy,' she said, flashing a nervous smile at her entourage.

'I feel like that's the safest route.'

Grande recently performed on the MTV Video Music Awards, collaborating with Jessie J and Nicki Minaj on the song Bang Bang.

All the focus was on Minaj who spent the time on stage clutching her dress to her body having experienced a reported 'wardrobe malfunction'.

Grande claims to have liked this supposedly off-the-cuff moment for the rapper.

'That's a true star. I mean you just go "OK, I'm naked, let's go." She killed her verse, she carried on and she went home and celebrated,' she said.
