Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino is ready to use his under-performing stars as makeweights in plans to strengthen his squad in January.

Among those who maybe deemed surplus to requirements by Pochettino include Paulinho, Andros Townsend, Aaron Lennon and Vlad Chiriches.

The quartet have made just four Premier League starts between themselves this season, and have not had the desired impact for Pochettino.

The Argentine watched his side slump to an embarrassing defeat by Stoke on Sunday as the club's disappointing start to their Barclays Premier League season continued.

Pochettino is determined to strengthen his squad once the January transfer window opens.

But as he found out in the summer, he will not be handed a vast transfer budget to sign the players he feels he needs to turn Spurs' season around.

Pochettino wants to sign two new strikers in the next window, Southampton's Jay Rodriguez being one of those.

He retains an interest in Rodriguez's team-mate Morgan Schneiderlin. Signing both could cost Spurs in excess of £40million.

Winger Aaron Lennon could also be deemed surplus to requirements by Tottenham manager Pochettino

And Pochettino is prepared to use a number of his fringe and under-performing players to supplement his January transfer budget. 

In his search for new talent, Pochettino has also been scouring the South American market.

River Plate striker Teo Gutierrez, who played for Colombia in the World Cup, has been watched by Spurs scouts.
