James Ward-Prowse believes his Southampton team-mates prefer the training methods of new boss Ronald Koeman over his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino.

Saints have made an electric start under the Dutch manager with the club second in the Premier League after six games.

The south coast club also beat beat Arsenal 2-1 at the Emirates to reach the fourth round of the Capital One Cup - their first victory away to the Gunners in 27 years.

Saints' flying start has suprised many following the departure of Pochettino to Tottenham in the summer as well as a mass exodus of first-team players including captain Adam Lallana and chief goalscorer Rickie Lambert.

Ward-Prowse though cites the training methods employed by Koeman as a key reason to their success - preferring his shorter drills to Pochettino's extra arduous sessions.

'With the new manager, training is more about short, sharp work, which I think the players prefer,' he told the BBC.

'I think you can see the differences in our performance.

'Pochettino likes to press a lot more and and we did a lot more extra running sessions late into the afternoon during his time at the club.'

Southampton travel to Tottenham on Sunday in what will be Pochettino's first meeting with his former club and Ward-Prowse, who will miss the match due to a fractured foot, also thinks the St. Mary's outfit can have a strong campaign.

'I know it's early in the season but we're showing signs we battle it out in the top half of the Premier League,' he added.
