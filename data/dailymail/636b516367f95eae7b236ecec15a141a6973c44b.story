Big spender: Philip Blond withdrew £40,000 from his think tank's coffers to fund a jet-set lifestyle

David Cameron’s former Big Society mentor was facing embarrassment yesterday over claims he ‘raided’ the coffers of his own think tank to pursue a jet-set lifestyle.

Phillip Blond, stepbrother of James Bond actor Daniel Craig, was revealed to have withdrawn £40,000 to cover personal ‘expenses’.

These included exotic trips abroad to meet women and £165 on a garish Regency-style chair decorated with pictures of women in bikinis and high heels sitting astride motorbikes.

The payments came at a time when his fledgling think tank ResPublica was struggling to pay its rent and staff wages.

It also that emerged Mr Blond once ‘treated’ Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin and his wife to tickets for a performance of The Magic Flute without mentioning they had been paid for by the company which owns the Canary Wharf complex.

A friend of Mr Blond last night acknowledged that the 45-year-old academic theologian, who is not married, ‘enjoys the good life’ but insisted he had ‘done nothing wrong’.

ResPublica insisted all the money had been properly accounted for.

Styles himself as the ‘Red Tory’, and is credited with inspiring the Prime Minister’s vision of a Big Society

Mr Blond, who styles himself as the ‘Red Tory’, is credited with inspiring the Prime Minister’s vision of a Big Society. 

He has carved out a reputation as a moralist, blaming Thatcherism for creating a damaging ‘Loadsamoney’ culture, and accusing New Labour of promoting values ‘essentially of personal pleasure and the pursuit of self-interest’.

Earlier this year he was awarded the Family Values Award by the Mormon church for his work in promoting marriage.

But leaked details from ResPublica suggest Mr Blond has not always practised what he preaches.

He asked a fellow academic to give a Ukrainian woman he was pursuing £300 in cash.

The
 academic responded: ‘What I could do is buy her a nice scarf or 
something and put the cash in there so it’s not too obvious.’

Policy: David Cameron has pushed his 'Big Society' scheme but it has so far failed to capture the public's imagination

Friends said the money was to help the woman, who is now Mr Blond’s girlfriend, get over a burglary.

Mr Blond also spent £1,690 to fly out for a rendezvous with the woman at the Swiss Inn Resort in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.

In March last year he flew to Brazil to meet another woman at the luxurious Porto Galinas resort, sending pictures of her in a bikini to his academic friend.

He also compared notes with his friend on a ‘hot Spanish journalist’ from a Catholic newspaper.

The details are believed to have been leaked by a disgruntled former member of staff.

Mr Blond, who rents a £4,100-a-month flat in the King’s Cross district of London, is paid a salary of £60,000.

But as ResPublica’s sole director and shareholder he is legally entitled to pay himself a hefty dividend from the profits.

The organisation’s accountants are said to have advised him to convert his £40,000 of personal spending into a dividend payment.

ResPublica said Mr Blond paid himself a ‘low base salary’, choosing to take the rest of his remuneration in dividends.

It apologised for an ‘oversight’ in not informing Mr Letwin who had paid for his hospitality at the opera.
