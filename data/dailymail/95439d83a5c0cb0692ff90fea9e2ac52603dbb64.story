The UK Government and UNICEF are hosting the first-ever Girl Summit to rally support for a campaign to accelerate efforts to end female genital mutilation (FGM) and child marriage – two practices currently affecting millions of girls across the globe.

UNICEF data released today show that rates of progress need to be scaled up dramatically in the countries where the practices are most common.

‘FGM and child marriage profoundly and 
permanently harm girls, denying them their right to make their own 
decisions and to reach their full potential. They are detriments to the 
girls themselves, their families, and their societies,’ said UNICEF 
Executive Director Anthony Lake.

‘Girls are not property; they have the right to determine their destiny. When they do so, everyone benefits,’ he added.

The UK Government and UNICEF are hosting the first-ever Girl Summit to rally support for a campaign to accelerate efforts to end female genital mutilation (FGM) and child marriage

More than 
130 million girls and women have experienced some form of FGM in the 29 
countries in Africa and the Middle East where the harmful practice is 
most common. Beyond extreme physical and psychological pain, girls who 
undergo FGM are at risk of prolonged bleeding, infection, infertility 
and death.

Child
 marriage is even more widespread and can lead to a lifetime of 
disadvantage and deprivation. Worldwide, more than 700 million women 
alive today were married as children. More than one in three – or some 
250 million – were married before 15.

A  host of celebrities including 
Jennifer Hudson, Cat Deeley, Stephen Fry, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, 
Melinda Gates and Dawn O’Porter have all shown their support for the 
campaign. 

Girls who marry before they turn 18 are less likely to remain in school and more likely to experience domestic violence

Ahead of the summit the world's first Insta-documentary, created from global Instagram submissions, was unveiled

The moving film sees people describing freedom, including one woman who says: 'Freedom is riding a scooter through Rome'

Girls who marry before they turn 18 are less likely to remain in school and more likely to experience domestic violence. Young teenage girls are more likely to die due to complications in pregnancy and childbirth than women in their 20s; their infants are more likely to be stillborn or die in the first month of life.

‘The numbers tell us we must accelerate our efforts. And let’s not forget that these numbers represent real lives. While these are problems of a global scale, the solutions must be local, driven by communities, families and girls themselves to change mindsets and break the cycles that perpetuate FGM and child marriage,’ Lake said. ‘We can’t let the staggering numbers numb us – they must compel us to act.’

Ahead of the summit the world’s first Insta-documentary, created from Instagram footage, was unveiled in honour of girls affected by child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM).

The 2:20 minute Insta-film, ‘Freedom Is…’ is calling for an end to these harmful practices and was created from Instagram submissions from across the world, including contributions from UK, USA, Italy, Greece, Armenia, Ethiopia and Zambia, submitted in response to a social media campaign asking the question ‘Freedom is…?’

David Cameron and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley have both pledged support for the Girl Summit

The film explores the impact of restricting freedom, especially for girls who are subjected to forced marriage and FGM, and encourages viewers to sign the Girl Summit Pledge (www.girlsummitpledge.com) to help end these harmful practices within a generation.

The moving film sees people describing their own freedom as 'riding a scooter through Rome', 'swimming with my son', the freedom to be myself', and 'being free of hate greed and ignorance' before looking at those who have their freedom taken from them through FGM or forced marriage.

The Girl Summit Pledge has received over 4,500 pledges and 34,000 social messages of support and has reached 286 million people to date, with support also secured from Mia Farrow, David Cameron, Bip Ling, Jon Snow and Sasha Wilkins,
