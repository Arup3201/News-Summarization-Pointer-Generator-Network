Incredible: Pareveen Ashraf was reunited with her handbag seven years after it was stolen and it still contained £250 cash tucked in a cheque book as well as personal photos

A woman has been reunited with her stolen handbag after seven years - and it still contained her £250 in cash.

Parveen Ashraf, 47, had given up hope of ever finding her designer cream and black Fiorelli handbag after it was stolen in a burglary in 2006.

But the handbag has been returned to her after it was uncovered by workmen while they were cutting back bushes just 300 yards from her home in Werrington, near Peterborough.

Other than her purse, it still contained all her personal belongings, including family photos, make-up and £250 tucked inside Mrs Ashraf's cheque book.

She had been planning to use the money to buy a watch for her husband Qamar's 50th birthday.

Mrs Asraf said: 'I guess the thief must have grabbed the £20 note that was in my purse, then flung the bag into the bush and cycled off.

'I never usually have so much money on me, but it was for a special occasion.

'The
thief obviously didn’t check through the rest of the bag and the 
plastic on the outside of the handbag has kept the notes safe all these 
years.

'I just can’t believe I have it back. I felt quite nostalgic and tearful going through the items inside.

'I think an angel must have been looking after it for me all that time.'

Mrs Ashraf was tracked down by
the workmen from Enterprise Peterborough through the personal photos 
she had in her handbag, including a treasured one of her husband.

In the seven years the cash has been 
missing it could have earned Ms Ashraf £57.47 if it had been put in an 
ISA with interest rates of three per cent a year. 

The handbag was stolen from Mrs 
Ashraf's kitchen when a thief entered her house through 
an unlocked door while she was unpacking luggage from a weekend away.

Mrs Ashraf, who has three children - Imran, 22, Sherine, 21 and Cyrus, 15 -  said: 'I had unloaded lots of bags so it took me a while to realise my handbag was missing.

'I was very upset, particularly as someone had come into our house in broad daylight.

'I cancelled all my credit cards and assumed I would never see it again.

'It’s
good to know there are still honest people in the world. To have the bag
and all my personal things returned was a little miracle, but finding 
the money was an added bonus.'
