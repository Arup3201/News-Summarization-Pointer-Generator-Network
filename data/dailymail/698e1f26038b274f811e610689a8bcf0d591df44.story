He left Dortmund for United in 2012, but struggled to convince a succession of managers that he was worthy of a regular starting place after arriving at Old Traffford for £12million.

The 25-year-old was eventually offloaded by Louis van Gaal for a cut price £6.3million in the summer to be reunited with coach Jurgen Klopp, who has claimed the playmaker's treatment at United reduced him to tears.

Dortmund, who eventually beat Freiburg 3-1, sold 5,000 Kagawa shirts when the midfielder returned to the club.
