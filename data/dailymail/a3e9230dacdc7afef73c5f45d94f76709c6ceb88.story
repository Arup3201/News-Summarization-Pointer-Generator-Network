He may be too young to drive a car, but he is already an old hand at operating diggers.

Aged just five, Wang Shuhan has been filmed driving a digger on a construction site in central China.

The youngster was captured on video calmly driving the yellow vehicle around the site in Whuan in Hubei province.

Old hand: At the age of just five, Wang Shuhan is filmed driving a digger on a construction site in central ChinaÂ 

He operated its wheel, gear stick and brakes, as well as using its scoop to pick up and move sand.

Shuhan's father Wang Xuebing, who works on the site, said his son became interested in driving diggers after he regularly brought him to work with him.

'I sometimes explained to him the functions of the gears within 
the compartment, and when he was three he asked me to have a try. Amazingly he did it,' he said.

Xuebing said the youngster now see the excavator as a big toy and often pleads to drive it.

But in the interest of safety, he added: 'I keep an eye on him when he runs it.'

It comes as yet another Chinese building has collapsed following heavy rains and strong winds.

A new underground car park in the city of Yan'an in western China's Shaanxi province toppled over today after rainstorms undermined the building's foundations.

Engineers claim the mass of water that flooded into the area could not have been foreseen, but they have been accused of failing to build proper foundations by local media.

Engineer An Meng, 52, said: 'We had finished the basic work and only needed to put the earth back around the side which would stop the water flooding down and eating away at the foundations.

'Because the site was still open all of the water in the area flooded into the hole and that turned the earth underneath into a liquid mass which quite simply couldn't support the car park.'

As a result, the huge building tipped to one side and seemingly sunk into the ground.

Council officials are now looking at whether they will need to demolish and rebuild the car park.

When it was completed, the underground multi-storey car park was expected to provide spaces for hundreds of vehicles.

If it is demolished, it will set the project back a year, causing further misery for motorists already facing lengthy traffic delays because of the construction work.

Earlier this week, another car park in China collapsed into a pit after a sudden and heavy rainfall washed away the soil beneath.

The stricken building, situated next to a construction site in Chengdu, in south-west China's Sichuan province, fell on Wednesday morning.

Five cars plunged 30ft into a deep pit, while another was left hanging precariously over the edge.

And in May, a petrol station sank into a giant hole in Hangzhou city in Zhejiang province after building site workers reportedly weakened the surrounding ground.
