Sorry: Dominic Grieve, the country's most senior law officer, has apologised after he said minority communities have brought with them 'endemic' corruption

A senior cabinet minister has apologised for claiming corruption in Britain’s Pakistani community is ‘endemic’.

Dominic Grieve QC, the Attorney General, said sorry after pointing to a ‘favour culture’ among  Pakistanis – remarks which were quickly branded ‘offensive’.

He told Saturday’s Daily Telegraph that corruption was a growing problem ‘because we have minority communities in this country which come from backgrounds where corruption is endemic’.

But just hours later Mr Grieve backtracked and issued  an apology.

In a statement he said: ‘If I gave the impression that there is  a particular problem in the  Pakistani community, I was wrong …  I believe the Pakistani community has enriched this country a great deal …  I’m sorry if I have caused any offence.’

His initial comments were rebuked by Tory MEP Sajjad Karim, who said they were ‘ill-advised’ and ‘offensive, divisive’.

Mr Karim accused Mr Grieve of trying to ‘paint all British  Pakistani community members in a certain light’.

The
 MP, whose Beaconsfield constituency in Buckinghamshire has a 
sizeable Asian community, said: 'I can see many of them have come because of 
the opportunities that they get. But they also come from societies where
 they have been brought up to believe you can only get certain things 
through a favour culture.

'One of the things you have to make absolutely clear is that that is not the case and it's not acceptable.'

Mr Grieve had previously said electoral corruption was a problem in constituencies such as Slough in Berkshire where Tory councillor Eshaq Khan (pictured) was found guilty of fraud involving postal ballots in 2008

Asked
 if he was referring to the Pakistani community in his comments, Mr 
Grieve told the newspaper: 'Yes, it's mainly the Pakistani community, 
not the Indian community. I wouldn't draw it down to one. I'd be wary of
 saying it's just a Pakistani problem.'

He used the interview to highlight the issue of electoral fraud as an area of particular concern.

However, Tory MEP Sajjad Karim, the party's legal affairs spokesman in the European Parliament, hit out at Mr Grieve.

He
 told the BBC: 'As a member of the British Pakistani community myself, I
 found these comments to be offensive, divisive; I do think they were 
ill-advised and I'm afraid the very general way in which Dominic is 
trying to make the points that he is making will have the net effect of 
being seen as purely populist in nature.'

He
 added that it was 'quite clear when one carries out even the most basic
 examination of the claims that he is making that the facts do not 
support the argument that he is presenting'.

Disgraced Khan and five others were jailed in 2009 for using 'ghost' voters to win a Slough Borough Council ballot (file picture)

Mr
 Karim continued: 'It's absolutely essential that if any politician in 
an influential position, regardless of whatever personal political 
ambitions that individual may have, it is essential that they do not try
 and behave in a way that creates a general impression about any 
particular community.

'If 
Dominic has got any individual specific points he wants to make in 
relation to voter fraud or anything of that nature that's quite a 
separate issue and can be looked at.

'But
 to try and generalise in this way and to paint all British Pakistani 
community members in a certain light, I'm afraid that is simply 
something that cannot be ignored and it is certainly not something that 
the British public at large will accept from Dominic at all.'

Today Mr Karim welcomed the Attorney General's apology.

In a message on Twitter the North West England MEP said: "Completely accept Dominic Grieve's apology. Thank you."

Tory chairman Grant Shapps said it was wrong to single out a particular community.

Inflammatory: David Cameron sparked outrage on a previous visit to India by suggesting Pakistan was 'exporting terrorism'

He
 told the BBC: 'Of course corruption needs to be rooted out wherever it 
is in this country. But we think that's something that needs to be 
tackled everywhere, not in a specific community.'

Mr
 Shapps said the Pakistani community has 'done an awful lot to work in 
this country and actually is a well-respected, established community 
that I think has lent a lot to Britain'.

He
 added: 'I don't agree that pinpointing one community over another is 
the right thing to do. Actually corruption is something which, wherever 
it is, this Government wants to root it out.

'If
 it's in voting, for example, then we have already passed a piece of 
legislation which means that people have to individually register for 
votes in the future. That will solve that problem.

'Wherever
 corruption exists we'll make sure we root it out but we certainly don't
 want to pin that on any particular communities.'

David
 Cameron sparked outrage earlier in his premiership when he accused 
Pakistan of ‘exporting terrorism’ while on a visit to India.

Baroness
 Warsi, the Foreign Office minister, has previously said the 
Conservatives lost three seats at the general election because of voter 
fraud in the Asian community.

Jailed for electoral fraud: Eshaq Khan

Disgraced Tory representative Eshaq Khan and five others used fake votes to oust longstanding Labour councillor Lydia Simmons from her seat on Slough Borough Council.

The audacious scam in 2007 was described by the Crown Prosecution Service as part of an 'epidemic' which threatens to destroy democracy in the UK.

Eshaq Khan, 52, received a three-and-a-half year prison sentence for conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and perjury.

During his trial the court heard that Eshaq Khan, a father-of-10, had been dishonestly elected as a Tory councillor in May 2007 after a scheme in which 'ghost voters' were registered on the electoral role.

The fraudulent plot was uncovered when ousted Labour councillor and former Mayor Miss Simmons and her Labour team questioned the result.

They pointed out that at a number of houses up to 19 names - all Asian - had registered in the run up to the election at the same address then opted to vote by post.

Charles Miskin, prosecuting at the trial said the action of the convicted vote-riggers was like a virus that needed to be eradicated.

He referred to a report by Electoral Commission Richard Mawrey QC which served as a warning that unless the UK election procedures are changed, the nation's democracy will be at stake.

Citing the report Mr Miskin said: 'The systems to deal with fraud are not working well, they are not working badly - the fact is there are no real systems.

'Until there are, fraud will continue unabated. The system for voting would disgrace a banana republic.'
