The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall received a rapturous welcome as they attended the famous Melbourne Cup on the latest leg of their Jubilee tour.

Despite the drizzle, Charles and Camilla went on a brief walkabout, shaking hands and waving at the crowds as they made their way into the main grandstand at Flemington racecourse.

The Royal couple were guests of honour at the prestigious sporting event that attracts tens of thousands of punters from across the country.

High spirits: Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, smile each other after the presentation of the Diamond Jubilee Plate

Fashion forward: Camilla's favourite milliner Philip Treacy was at the event and for the Duchess he had created a wide brimmed cream hat that matched her flowing coat and dress by Bruce Oldfield

Winning streak: Camilla hands the Melbourne Cup to the Nick Williams, son of Lloyd Williams, the owner of Irish horse Green Moon, after it won at Flemington race course

Thunderous: The pair pulled amused faces when a clap of thunder rang out while they were waiting to present the Diamond Jubilee Plate

Fashion is as much a part of the event 
as the horse racing and the women racegoers were dressed in summer 
dresses and wore hats and fascinators.

Among the guests was Camilla's 
favourite milliner Philip Treacy. He said: 'It's a great honour to 
design hats for the future Queen of England and I'm very excited to be 
here on a day when the royal couple are in Melbourne.'

For the Duchess he had created a wide brimmed cream hat that matched her flowing coat and dress by Bruce Oldfield.

She held a clear umbrella over her head when rain started to spit down, although Charles was happy to brave the elements.

Up-close: As the royal couple watched the running of the Melbourne Cup Prince Charles pulled out a pair of binoculars, but Camilla was happy to watch from a distance

Honoured: The Royal couple were guests of honour at the prestigious sporting event that attracts tens of thousands of punters from across the country.

It was almost 27 years to the day that Prince Charles and Diana visited the racecourse.

Today the royal couple met some of the 
leading jockeys from the race in the weighing room including Ryan Moore 
from the UK, the three-times champion jockey who has only recently 
returned to flat racing after breaking his wrist in August.

He was riding Mount Athos and was quizzed by the Duchess about whether he was suffering any jetlag.

Camilla, who is a keen horse rider 
and equestrian fan, told jockey James McDonald, riding Fiorente, that 
"it's a treat for us" to be at the Melbourne Cup.

Billed as the race that stops the 
nation the Duchess presented the winning trophy for the event that has a
total prize money pot of around £4 million.

The Prince also took part in proceedings awarding the prize for a Diamond Jubilee race.

Dressed for the occasion: Prince Charles looked dapper in a blue and white pinstripe suit

Earlier in the day the Prince of Wales tried his hand at the ancient art of tapestry weaving today - and proved to be a natural.

Charles worked on a large textile 
piece that will have pride of place in a hospital during a visit to the 
Australian Tapestry Workshop in Melbourne.

Despite being famed for his "sausage 
fingers", the heir to the throne, under the direction of senior weaver 
Sue Batten, added a few threads to the tapestry depicting a rural scene 
complete with horses and cows.

Engagements: The Royal couple are in Australia on the second leg of a Diamond Jubilee Tour taking in Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand

Back in time: Charles and Diana visited the event 27 years ago to the day

What a difference a few decades makes: Charles at the races nearly three decades ago

The large artwork was fitted to a 
frame and the Prince pulled a few vertical threads, known as leashes, 
forward and threaded a bobbin, tied with pale blue thread for the sky, 
through the gap.

Turning to the banks of cameramen and photographers the royal joked, 'having a good laugh.'

Ms Batten said later: 'He was good, 
but the thing about the Prince is that he does value the arts and 
crafts, he thinks they should be recognised and maintained as part of 
our culture.

Good luck wishes: Camilla speaks with jockey Tommy Berry before the running of the Melbourne Cup at Flemington race course

Words of wisdom: Prince Charles, right, speaks with British jockey Ryan Moore as the royal couple meet jockeys before the race

Making an entrance: The royal couple arrive to watch the race in a white estate car

'In the world everything is about business and money and these things get neglected.'

During the visit Charles met children working on a joint project between
the Australian Tapestry Workshop and his Prince's School of Traditional
Arts.

Charles sat down amongst the local 
youngsters who had made a large geometric piece of artwork and spent a 
few minutes listening to them explain how they produced their work.

Creative side: Earlier in the day the Prince of Wales tried his hand at the ancient art of tapestry weaving today - and proved to be a natural

Exploration: During the visit Charles met children working on a joint project between the Australian Tapestry Workshop and his Prince's School of Traditional Arts

Getting involved: Despite being famed for his 'sausage fingers', the heir to the throne added a few threads to the tapestry depicting a rural scene complete with horses and cows

The Prince then went on to the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground to learn about the Harmony in Cricket programme.

The initiative brings together 
different communities through sport and the royal watched as youngsters 
practised their throwing and catching skills.

One little boy, 10-year-old Chien 
Mayoum, hit a single plastic stump with a ball time after time, but when
Charles had a go he missed by metres and joked: 'I have broken my arm 
in two places so I can't do it.'
