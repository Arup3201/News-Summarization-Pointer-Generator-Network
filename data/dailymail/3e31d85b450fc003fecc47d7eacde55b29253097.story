Security company G4S were forced to spend almost half a million pounds changing all of the locks at a prison they were contracted to run - after blundering guards lost the keys.

The firm has to replace every lock and key at HMP Birmingham, known as Winson Green jail, when the set of keys vanished in October 2011 - costing £499,000.

The embarrassing blunder came just days after G4S took over the management of the prison - with 1,400 bring confined to their cells while the premises was searched.

Blunder: Security company G4S had to spend £499,00 changing all of the locks at Birmingham's Winson Green jail - after blundering guards lost the keys

A source told the Sunday People that the jail has been in a state of chaos ever since.

He said: 'There are staff shortages and inmates have been pushing their luck.'

West Midlands Police arrested a man in his 30s over the lost keys but no charges were pursued.

The gaffe is just one in a series of embarrassments for the company - who had to pay out £70million after failing to provide enough guards for the London Olympics.

Formerly known as Group 4 - the company earned an unfavourable reputation for losing prisoners they were minding.

Catalogue of errors: The blunder is the latest in a series of embarrassing mistakes made by the security firm 

In January, G4S were forced to play down a 'full scale riot' at Britain's largest privately-run jail - which saw inmates take over an entire wing and booby-trap the doorways, a prison officer claimed.

Inmates had a nine-hour stand-off with guards at  HMP Oakwood near Wolverhampton, nicknamed 'Jokewood' for its alleged lax security. 

Figures from Prisons minister Andrew Selous show that keys have been lost 237 times at jails since 2010, costing taxpayers £493,161.

The three most expensive prison lock and key replacements at prisons since 2010 are:

Mr Selous said: 'Security and protecting the public is paramount and we replace compromised locks as quickly as possible. We are also increasing use of electronic and biometric systems.

'Under the previous Government nearly £700, 000 was spent in two years alone - but in recent years the cost of these incidents to the taxpayer has fallen significantly.

'The incident at HMP Birmingham in 2011 came at no cost to the taxpayer.'

The most expensive key and lock replacements were at Glen Parva, Leicestershire (£208,329), Warren Hill, Suffolk (£101,301) and Swaleside, Kent (£95,430).

This year keys have been lost at Lindholme, South Yorkshire (£40,286), Haverigg, Cumbria (£32,882) and Highpoint, Suffolk (£14,933).

A spokesman for G4S said: 'As has previously been extensively reported, this incident took place 18 days after G4S assumed responsibility for the establishment in 2011. 

'Subsequently, G4S changed the keys for HMP Birmingham. G4S paid in full for this and, as a result, the UK taxpayer did not pay a single penny for this course of action. 

'Since that time, G4S has examined, reviewed and amended the procedures and policies, which had been in place when it assumed responsibility for the establishment.'
