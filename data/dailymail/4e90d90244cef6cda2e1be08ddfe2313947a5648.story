Gemma Kyle and her daughter, Selma, (above) have been given £2,900 online by strangers

Kind strangers have donated £3,000 to help a young mother and her toddler daughter move out of a mouldy, rat-infested flat. 

Gemma Kyle appealed to friends and family for money after growing tired of living in the bedsit in Romford, Essex, with two-year-old Selma and her fiancee, Atakan Koskal.

The 22-year-old had been applying for a council house, but was told it would up to five years to find a suitable property. 

Just two weeks after setting up a Gofundme page, Ms Kyle, a Muslim convert, has received £2,900 in donations from friends and strangers. 

Appealing for help on the page called Help to give Selma a better life, the young mother wrote: 'I currently live in a bedsit that is infested with mice and mould. 

'I have been here for 3 years with very little or no help.

'After 3 years of living like this and being forced to watch my family suffer ive decided I can't take it anymore, so decided to take action myself, my council seems to think it is okay to live like this.' 

As donations piled in, the young mother spoke of her frustration with the council for not being able to find her a home. 

'People think because we live in Britain everything is okay and that people aren’t living in poverty - but the reality is different.   

'I’ve got mice traps in the kitchen and the bedroom we share is tiny. It would be okay for one person but not a whole family.' 

The former shop assistant moved into the property which costs £360 a month in 2012 before giving birth to Selma. 

As the flat's condition deteriorated, the young mother contacted the council for help and claims she was told she lived in 'overcrowded' and 'unsanitary' housing. 

The family have been forced to set mice traps and share a bathroom with other people in the building 

Ms Kyle appealed to strangers online, asking for donations so that she may give her daughter a better life

Despite having to set traps for rodents and see her partner sleep on the floor, Ms Kyle claims she was told there were other people in worse housing than she is

More than 100 people have donated money to the young mother so that she may be able to move out of the property

The family say they are desperate to leave the flat in Romford, Essex, but had no prospects until recently

Ms Kyle - who takes her fiance's last name, said she started crying when online donations reached £500

Later this was allegedly contradicted, with another official telling Ms Kyle others lived in worse properties. 

She was then told she could face waiting up to five years to move into a council property. 

But after setting up the online donations page, the family is hopeful they will be able to move out in the near future. 

'When I saw the donations came in - one as much as £500 - I started crying because I couldn't believe it. 

'Unfortunately I could not even message them to say thank you as it was anonymous. I’m so grateful for their support.' 

Barking and Dagenham Council refused to comment but said in a letter: 'Ms Kyle is bidding regularly for houses but is accepted that it is a matter of personal choice. 

'The waiting time for a house in generally longer than that for flatted accommodation. 

'With the registered level of priority and increased demand on housing, it is unlikely Ms Kyle will be rehoused during this period.'

'So grateful': Ms Kyle thanked well-wishers for their support after raising almost £3,000 in just two weeks
