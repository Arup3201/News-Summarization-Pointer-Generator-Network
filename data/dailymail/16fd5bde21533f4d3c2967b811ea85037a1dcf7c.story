A schoolboy who died after being hit by a car four days before Christmas may have thrown himself to his death, it emerged today.

Sam Belcher, 15, was said to have jumped in front of a Ford Ka driven by a teenage girl travelling home in the early hours of the morning.

The youngster died instantly in the 2.30am collision in the village of Pamber Heath, near Tadley, Hampshire, less than a mile from his family home.

Police initially arrested the 18-year-old girl on suspicion of causing the boy’s death.

But she has been released on bail until March and it is now understood detectives are focusing their inquiries on why Sam suddenly appeared in front of the girl’s car.

His death will also be investigated by a coroner at a later date.

The teenager died instantly when he was thrown into the road by the impact.

Neighbours said the family was asleep and unaware that the 15-year-old had left the house and was walking at the side of the road.

No other vehicle was involved in the collision which was understood to have happened ‘at speed’.

Sam’s family spent Christmas mourning the death of their young son who was described by friends as ‘amazing.’

Announcing
an appeal for witnesses, a Hampshire Police statement said: ‘We are 
investigating the exact circumstances surrounding the collision and how 
the boy came to be in the road.

‘The
driver was arrested and taken to custody for questioning. She was 
shaken but uninjured.’ She was later released on police bail.

Neighbours in Silchester Road described being woken up at 2.30am by a loud bang.

‘I woke up suddenly after hearing what I could only describe as a loud thump,’ said one woman, who declined to be named.

‘At
first I did not think anything of it and just thought that a car had 
hit an animal, but then we heard all the ambulances and saw the blue 
flashing lights.’

Locals said that the 30mph stretch of road was notorious for speeding drivers.

‘People race through here, particularly first thing in the morning and at night,’ said a man.

‘We have been complaining about it for years but nobody does anything. We are just so sad that a person has died.’

Yellow police boards appealing for witnesses, marked the scene of the collision.

A number of bouquets of flowers had also been lined on the roadside.

One read: ‘RIP Sam. You were such an amazing person and an amazing friend. You will never be forgotten. Thank you for everything.’

Another neighbour said: ‘it is just desperately sad this close to Christmas.’

Mrs Belcher said that she was too upset to speak about her son Sam’s death.

On the doorstep of her red brick semi-detatched home she said: ‘I just don’t want to speak to anyone,’
