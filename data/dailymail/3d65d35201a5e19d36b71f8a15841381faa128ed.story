Predator: Jean Alexis was given an indeterminate sentence after he preyed on three women on the rail network

A rapist who preyed on women on the rail network in a series of random attacks has been jailed for an indeterminate period.

Jean Alexis, 26, denied six different charges, including rape, sexual assault and theft in relation to the offences involving three women.

Following a trial earlier this year, he was convicted by a jury on Friday and handed an indeterminate jail sentence at Luton Crown Court.

He will spend a minimum of five years in prison, British Transport Police (BTP) said.

Alexis carried out three attacks in Harlington,
Leagrave and Luton, Bedfordshire, in October and December last year and
February this year.

The court heard how Alexis, of The Ridings, Luton, dragged an 18-year-old woman into a train toilet and raped her.

Alexis had met the woman near Luton station before boarding the train with her and attacking her on December 15.

He also followed an off-duty police officer from a train to her car at Leagrave station where he made threats towards her.

He also made sexual advances and inappropriately touched a 19-year-old woman on a St Pancras-bound train.

An investigation was launched by BTP’s Major Investigation Unit and, after hours of CCTV was viewed and forensic DNA examinations carried out, Alexis was identified.

He was arrested a week later by BTP and Bedfordshire Police officers at his home address.

As part of his sentence he has also been placed on the sex offenders’ register for ten years and was recommended for deportation following his jail term, a BTP spokesman said.

Speaking after sentencing, Detective Inspector Ian Trantum, BTP’s senior investigating officer, praised the victims for their courage and bravery in coming forward to police.

He added: 'Alexis preyed on lone women travelling on the rail network in the early hours and his behaviour and actions were something no one should be subjected to.

'What each victim had to endure is unthinkable and Alexis is now where he belongs for this despicable act - behind bars.

'Despite pleading not guilty, the overwhelming evidence helped the jury in their unanimous decision.

'This sentence highlights the severity with which crimes like this are treated. BTP takes all allegations of sexual offences extremely seriously and will always seek to catch and prosecute those responsible.'

Baljit Ubhey, chief Crown prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service, branded Alexis a 'predatory and dangerous individual'.

He said: 'This case involved the 
serious sexual abuse of women. We have worked closely with the British 
Transport Police since this investigation was launched.

'None
of the victims knew Alexis; these were random attacks on people on 
trains or at stations between Luton and Flitwick. Alexis is clearly a 
predatory and dangerous individual.

'Alexis
was found guilty of all the offences in August following a trial at 
Luton Crown Court. We would like to thank the victims for their courage 
in coming forward and preventing further despicable offences by him.

'The public should feel safe on public transport.

'The prosecution, conviction and sentence imposed today recognises the seriousness of the offences.

'I
hope that today’s sentence gives some sense of closure to the victims 
involved, so that they can now put this unpleasant episode behind them 
and move on with their lives. Our thoughts are very much with them at 
this time.'
