'Troll Hunter': Kaitlin Jackson has said she is so incensed with messages from people targeting others on social media that she reports and names and shames those responsible

A mother-of-five has revealed she spends six hours every night trawling the internet for ‘trolls’ in a bid to vanquish online bullying.

Kaitlin Jackson has dedicated her evenings to bringing people to justice after becoming fed up with horrifying posts that hijack online tribute pages, profiles and charity groups.

Ms Jackson has said she is so incensed with messages from people targeting others on social media that she reports and names and shames those responsible.

The 45-year-old, who has battled for five years to have social media websites regulated, is known as ‘The Troll Hunter’ by friends and insists that she will not stop until something is changed.

She has joined thousands of people calling on Prime Minister David Cameron to do more to regulate social media websites after 14-year-old Leicestershire schoolgirl Hannah Smith hanged herself after being abused online.

Ms Jackson said: 'Social networks are out of control. Their inventors have given birth to a monster that is ruining hundreds of people’s lives.

'It’s just about profit to these companies - they don’t care if their sites are being used to destroy people’s lives.

'A child’s life is more important than profit.'

Ms Jackson, of Aberystwyth, Wales, first turned her attention to cyber bullies after seeking support after she suffered a miscarriage.

She said: 'There has to be an overhaul of the current system before more people are targeted and affected - or even worse affected so much they cannot cope and take their own life.

'The death of young Hannah is absolutely heart-breaking, it just hits every parent the same way. The trauma her family are going through is something that cannot, and should not, be experienced again.'

Ms Jackson has invested up to 8,000 hours hunting trolls online - and has seen hundreds of pages, blogs and profiles shut down.

Her tactics involve bombarding posters with messages asking them to explain their actions, sharing their comments with thousands of others or tracking down the person and exposing their identity.

Ms Jackson said her own teenage daughter has also been the subject of a tirade of abuse.

Justice': Ms Jackson has described social networks as 'out of control'

She said: 'My teenage daughter was targeted by bullies and the comments she had sent to her were horrendous. The bullying teenagers are subjected to erodes their personality and confidence.

'When she was targeted, I messaged these anonymous people myself and told them that I had printed every message and had taken them to the police.

'I report about 40 trolls or trolling sites to Facebook a night - and if I see the same people or sites still up a few days later, I’ll report them to the police’s hate crime unit.'

But despite her consistent efforts and fighting she is rarely able to enjoy the fruits of her hard work as police investigations remain anonymous.

Ms Jackson said: 'It’s very frustrating because the police often say they can’t take action on internet bullying because the sites these messages are posted on are foreign.

'No-one is willing to be responsible for policing these sites. Someone needs to find these trolls who are abusing people anonymously and lock them up.

'I’m providing the police and the sites with as much evidence as I can but the problem is getting worse and worse.

'There has to be a harsh penalty. When people are taking their own lives because of abuse it’s manslaughter.'
