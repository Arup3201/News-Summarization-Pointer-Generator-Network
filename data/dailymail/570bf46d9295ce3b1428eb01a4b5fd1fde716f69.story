A 'pork' sausage being sold in a Londis store was found to be almost half made up of horse meat.

The lukanka chumerna sausage, imported from Bulgaria to the store in Dartford Kent by a British firm, was discovered at the height of the horse meat scandal.

The vacuum-packed product was  labelled as containing pork sausage meat, but was actually 46 per cent horse.

Dartford Magistratres Court heard an investigation after the test purchase in October last year found it had been imported by London-based Expo Foods Limited. 

Despite the large media coverage concerning the presence of undeclared horse meat in various food products in January last year, the court was told the company undertook no tests on the sausage, which was imported in September 2013.

Expo Foods pleaded guilty yesterday to a charge under the Food Safety Act that the product was not of the substance demanded.

The company was fined £5,000 and ordered to pay £2,500 in costs to Kent County Council, who brought the prosecution, and a £120 surcharge.

The shop was found not to be in breach of any regulations and had co-operated fully in the investigation

After the court case, the council said the shop was found not to be in breach of any regulations and had co-operated fully in the investigation.

Richard Strawson, the council's trading standards manager, said: 'We are obviously concerned that this product was found on sale in Kent.

'We are aware of the sensitivities amongst the public concerning eating horse meat and therefore feel our actions were necessary to ensure that they can have confidence that what they eat is accurately described.'

Following the sample results Expo Foods instigated a voluntary withdrawal of the product in liaison with their local authority and the Food Standards Agency.

John Barnes, the Food Standards Agency's head of local delivery, said: 'We are pleased that trading standards services continue to be vigilant to ensure food is correctly described to enable the public to make informed choices about what they eat. We fully support Kent County Council in the action it has taken.'
