Two police officers have been knocked down and badly injured in a hit-and-run.

The officers were struck by a car in Harpurhey, north Manchester last night, leaving one with broken bones and the other with a fractured skull.

They had left their vehicle in Rochdale Road to speak to a driver and passenger late last night who then smashed into them before driving off.
