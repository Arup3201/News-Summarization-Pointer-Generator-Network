A man fell backwards from an 11th floor window of a Colorado casino hotel room to his death Saturday morning during a bachelor party.

The party had apparently stretched into the early morning, as police say Dirk Anderson, 29, plummeted from the room at Lady Luck Hotel and Casino in Black Hawk around 5am.

The Thornton, Colorado resident was perched on a window sill when the screen behind him gave way, causing the fatal fall.

Authorities still await toxicology reports that will determine how much alcohol, if any, Anderson consumed.
