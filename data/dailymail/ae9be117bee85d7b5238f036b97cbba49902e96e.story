Five-and-half-million dogs owners will put their pets at risk this Christmas by feeding them harmful food, a worrying new study reveals.

The research shows 61 per cent of owners will let their dogs join them round the table for Christmas dinner.

Shockingly, 56 per cent will feed their pet potentially harmful human foods - despite knowing it can be severely damaging.

The survey, by pet food company Forthglade, quizzed dog owners about feeding their canines indulgent foods over the festive season.

It found an alarming 15 per cent have taken their pet to the vet over Christmas because it has fallen ill from eating human food.

The research reveals 71 per cent admit feeding their dog turkey in gravy and 28 per cent give them stuffing - both of which can lead to vomiting and diarrhoea.

Half of owners (49 per cent) say they feed them human food at Christmas because they feel their pet is 'part of the family'.

It seems people don't want their four-legged-friends to miss out on mince pies at Christmas either.

One-in-10  'treat' dogs to a mince pie unaware the raisins or sultanas in it can result in kidney failure for their pet.

An alarming one-in-five feel it's acceptable to feed pets human food because 'Christmas is a special occasion.'

TV presenter Adam Henson today issued a health warning to dog owners, highlighting the dangers of sharing Christmas foods with their pets.

The Countryfile star said: 'I can't believe how ignorant owners are at Christmas. The results of the study are really worrying.'

He added: 'I have two dogs at home that I adore but I'm aware of the dangers of humanising and sharing too much with them.

'Don't let your dogs anywhere near your indulgent foods at the Christmas table, however much they appear to love it.

'If you share food with your dog it will not only be a hazard to their health but it can cause behavioural issues, dominance, hyper-activity and obesity.

'This Christmas, treat your dog to a healthy balanced diet - it will be the best gift you can give them.'

Some festive treats that should avoid the dog's food-bowl are stuffing, gravy, raisins, sultanas and stocking favourite - chocolate.
