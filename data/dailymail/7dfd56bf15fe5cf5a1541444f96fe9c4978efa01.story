Police are investigating a shooting in Brisbane in which a car and a house belonging to two separate Muslim families were hit.

A firearm, believed to be a shotgun, was used to fire into the Kentish Street house, at Mount Gravatt East in the city's south east, while several hundred metres away shots were  fired into a car at Dunbar Street. 

Both attacks, which happened about midnight,  have sparked outrage among Brisbane's Islamic community with one leader suggesting they could have been motivated by 'hate.'

Detectives say it is too early to identify who is behind the shootings, but Brisbane Islamic community leader Ali Kadri said the events were culturally motivated.

'For all we know it could be a hate crime, but we would like to wait until the police complete their investigation,' he told The Courier Mail.

The incidents were reported yesterday morning and officers remained on the scene last night. 

The owner of the shot vehicle did not return calls when contacted by Daily Mail Australia.  

A police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia no further details on the shootings were available  and an update would likely be released on Sunday.

Mr Kadri said a pattern of anti-Islamic messaging had been popping up around Brisbane suburbs.

At Algester, in the city's south-west, vile content spreading anti-Islamic messages had been graffiti'd at a school, while other messages of hate were found at an Islamic centre at Rocklea.

A man was arrested and charged with wilful damage and trespass for the Rocklea incident.

Mr Kadri also spoke openly about the Muslim community's reaction to the recent terror raids on homes across Australia, where he said he was 'shocked.'

'Over the last week we have had message of hate, but we have also had messages of encouragement,' he said following at the time of the raids.

He has also spoken openly on the rejection of a Currumbin Mosque, on the Gold Coast, a decision he said was a narrow minded.

The controversial proposal for a mosque in Currumbin on the Gold Coast had been rejected by the city's council with a vote of 10-5 against its construction. 

Mr Kadri said: 'I am disappointed that without engaging and communicating [the community] have opposed the mosque,' Kafri said.

'People have a right to object to anything and everything they want, but it should be based on fact,' he said.
