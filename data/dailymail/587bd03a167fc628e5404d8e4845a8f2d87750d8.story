Unrepentant: Elliot Jackson went on Facebook to say he 'wished' Cregan would come to Wales and 'take out our pigs'

A man has been arrested for allegedly setting up a Facebook site praising murder suspect Dale Cregan.

Detectives took jobless Neil Swinburne, 22, away for questioning after they traced the website ‘Dale Cregan is a Hero’ to his home in Liverpool.

The page contained posts which mocked the deaths of WPCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes.

One read: ‘So a pair of coppers got killed who gives a s***?’

Another, making reference to the Hillsborough report which criticised the police for the disaster in which 96 fans died, added: ‘Justice for the 96 not the two.’

Swinburne was arrested under the Communications Act 2003. If found guilty, he faces a six month jail sentence. He was bailed last night.

Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘I think [the public] would have wanted us to take positive action and that’s exactly what ourselves and Merseyside Police have done.’

Elsewhere, an internet troll who described Cregan as a ‘legend’ stood by his comments, comparing the murder suspect to crazed killer Raoul Moat.

Jobless Elliot Jackson of Newtown, Powys, went on Facebook to say he ‘wished’ Cregan would come to Wales and ‘take out our pigs’.

When confronted by the Mail, the 20-year-old said he had no sympathy for the two WPCs because police officers are ‘all dirty scumbags’.

Speaking about Cregan, he added: ‘He is a legend. He shot down two police. Move over Raoul Moat, there’s a new guy on the block.’ 

Jackson, who admits he has been to jail for violent crimes, initially demanded money for an interview, but spoke even though he was assured he would not receive a penny.

Later his mother, Alison, said: ‘They are disgusting things to say. Two families are suffering because two policewomen have died. They have all my sympathy.’

The Facebook arrest comes after 
Greater Manchester Police thanked the public and said officers took 
heart from the huge outpouring of goodwill and public support.

The force has received 33,500 messages 
on its online book of condolence and more than 21,000 have been posted 
on the force's Facebook page.

More than 1.3 million people have viewed the tribute to the officers on Facebook.

Action: Facebook said it had removed tribute pages linked to Dale Cregan's case

Police
officers from across the country have offered to provide cover in 
Greater Manchester so that colleagues of PC Hughes and PC Bone can 
attend their funerals.

Mr
Shewan warned of the threat from a long-standing feud between two 
criminal families in the area and has issued Osman warnings - notices 
given to people under threat of being murdered or seriously injured - to
'a large number of individuals'.

Tuesday's murders of the officers 
were a 'watershed' moment, he said, adding that the force's message was:
'Enough is enough. This has to end.'

He added that despite everything the force has done to tackle gun crime, 'tragedies still do occur'.

'Tuesday's events simply make us spur on to higher and greater efforts,' Mr Shewan said. 'I think what we've seen on Tuesday has had to appeal to everyone in terms of a watershed moment.'

'I
would say the strong message that Greater Manchester Police has been 
using over the last six weeks, and perhaps even further back, is, 
"Enough is enough. This has to end".

'That's why we've been working with individuals with threats to life notices as part of our investigation.

'That's why we've had such an intensive policing operation in place.

'And that's why Tuesday's events have hit us so hard.'

He went on: 'We were investigating a 
feud between two criminal families, we continue to do that, and the link
between that and Tuesday's events is still part of an ongoing and 
active investigation.'

Mr 
Shewan went on: 'I think anybody who perhaps wishes to take the 
opportunity, following such a tragedy, to tastelessly add derogatory 
comments, to perhaps think that they're poking fun at such a tragic 
situation, will always cause a great deal of emotion.

'I
think police officers - not just police officers, ordinary members of 
the public - and I looked at some of these websites and saw ordinary 
members of the public alarmed and really distressed at some of the 
ridiculous comments that have been put on there.

'I think they would have wanted us to take positive action and that's exactly what ourselves and Merseyside Police have done.'

Call: The country's top prosecutor, Keir Starmer QC, said it was time for an 'informed debate about the boundaries of free speech in an age of social media'

He
added that the 'heart-warming' public support in the wake of the 
murders 'has meant a great deal to Greater Manchester Police, to its 
officers, and to all of the partners and also to the communities'.

'I
know the families too have been taking real solace from reading the 
positive stories and the positive message of support being expressed by 
ordinary members of the public here in Greater Manchester and across the
UK,' he said.

A Facebook 
spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that tribute pages have been 
removed...because they violated Facebook’s statements of rights and 
responsibilities.’
