A severely emaciated dog, barely a year old, has been described as a 'walking skeleton' by shocked police and animal welfare inspectors.

The young female crossbreed, who has been named Jess, was handed in to a police station on Friday by a member of the public after being found in Duke Street, Glasgow.

At 5.75kg, the dog is less than half her ideal weight, and her ribcage and spine were protruding.

She is still in a critical condition even after treatment.

Police staff were said to be so alarmed that they took Jess to a vet for emergency treatment.

She was given a blood transfusion and is in a critical condition.

Billy Linton, a senior inspector with the animal welfare charity Scottish SPCA, said: 'Jess is probably the most emaciated living dog I've ever seen. She is effectively a walking skeleton.

'Weight loss on this level does not happen overnight and we believe she may have been neglected over a prolonged period of time, although we can't rule out the possibility that she may have been trapped or abandoned in a property.

'Her collar was hanging off her neck and she was severely anaemic and weak.

'Her feet and legs were heavily stained with urine and faeces, suggesting she has been kept in a kennel or cage for some time.

'Jess is still very unwell.

'She received a blood transfusion on Monday after collapsing at the vets and her gut is badly damaged due to the extent of her starvation.

'However, we are hopeful she will make a recovery.

'We think she's just a young dog, around a year old, and a collie-cross-lurcher type.

'Despite everything she's been through, she is still friendly and trusting of humans which is both incredible and heart-breaking at the same time.'

Anyone with information about Jess is asked to contact Scottish SPCA's on 03000 999 999.
