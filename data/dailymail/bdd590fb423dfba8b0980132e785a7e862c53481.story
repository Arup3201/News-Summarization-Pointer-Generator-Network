A female CEO has apologized to every mother she has ever encountered in the workplace for 'silently slandering' their commitment to their jobs. 

PowerToFly President Katharine Zaleski admitted, in a first-person piece for Fortune magazine, that she didn't realize how awful she had been - until she became a mother herself.

The 34-year-old, who lives with her husband and daughter in Brooklyn, New York, recalled one instance where she made a silent presumption about a Time managing editor.

Ms Zaleski presumed that she was 'too much of a mother' to follow through on a partnership idea - based on the pictures of the editor's children on her desk.

PowerToFly President Katharine Zaleski admitted in an essay that she used to be a harsh critic of working moms during her time as an editor at Huffington Post and Washington Post

Ms Zaleski, a former editor at Huffington Post and The Washington Post in her twenties, wrote that she also judged women who couldn't make it to last-minute team drinks - even though they would arrive at work two hours earlier the next day. 

She also didn't speak up when another female editor said they should  fire a woman who was pregnant.

Working 'late' became an obsession, she said, in order to show commitment to her job - even though mothers in the office would typically skew their days much earlier. 

Ms Zaleski wrote in Fortune: 'For mothers in the workplace, it’s death by a thousand cuts – and sometimes it’s other women holding the knives.'

Soon after giving birth herself, Zaleski said that she believed her career was over and that she couldn't imagine going back to the office for ten hours each day. 

Soon afterwards she met Milena Berry who wanted to start a company that would allow women to work from home in a range of jobs. PowerToFly was born. 

And that Time editor whom she silently wrote off? Ms Zaleski explains that Cathy Sharick, mother-of-three, has now joined the business as executive editor.

PowerToFly allows women to work from anywhere that suits them - from their home office to a coffee shop. 

Workers can take on full-time or part-time contracts, but as the company website states: 'We give you a lot of freedom and we expect a lot in return.'

Ms Zaleski said in several interviews this week that all the tools for moms to work remotely are already in place. 

Conference calls can be made on Skype, presentations shared on Google Docs, team planning completed on Jira.

Women from 65 countries have joined the site to improve their chance at finding work - and have so far taken home a collective $1 million in pay, according to Ms Zaleski.

The challenges are many, the co-founder wrote - and sometimes from career-driven, younger women who she described as 'hardliners' about spending time in the office 'culture'. 

She wrote: 'They don’t realize how that ''culture'' pushes women out because it’s too often set up around how men bond. 

'Many of these young women are just toeing the company line. I don’t begrudge them. I feel sorry for them. They’re hurting their future selves. Just like I did.'
