Scotland Yard detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have held an important meeting with Portuguese counterparts that they hope will lead to a major breakthrough in the case.

Four Met Police officers met with senior members of Portugal’s detective squad, the Policia Judiciaria (PJ), in Faro, to urge them to carrying out inquiries identified by the British investigation known as Operation Grange.

The detectives had arrived in the Algarve on Monday afternoon and held a three-hour meeting, starting at 10am yesterday.

Investigation: British police officers arrive in downtown Faro, Portugal, carrying documents believed to be related to three men who may be connected with the disappearance of toddler Madeline McCann in 2007

Abducted: Madeleine McCann was three when she vanished from her parents' apartment in Praia da Luz

Breakthrough: British officers met for three hours with Portuguese counterparts about new leads

Investigation: The officers met police in the city of Faro, whose jurisdiction includes the town of Praia de Luz

Wearing sunglasses and carrying suitcases full of documents, the officers arrived in Portugal on Monday

The Met officers held talks with the head of the PJ in Faro, Mota Carmo, and Ana Paula-Rita, the coordinator for the PJ office in Portimao, whose jurisdiction covers Praia da Luz, in the hope of gathering new evidence.

British police want to interview three burglars who have been identified as prime suspects in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in May 2007.

Analysis of mobile phone data suggests the men were ‘very close’ to the holiday apartment in Praia da Luz when the three-year-old vanished.

It also indicates they made an unusually high number of calls to each other in the hours that followed her abduction in 2007.

A source close to the PJ told the Daily Mail: ‘The British police came to Faro for a meeting at 10am.

Chat: The four officers, pictured, are pushing closer to being able to arrest three 'prime suspects'

Detectives: The officers had a morning meeting in Portugal before heading for lunch

Time for new leads: Analysis of mobile phone data suggests three burglars were 'very close' to the holiday flat when the three-year-old girl vanished. Pictured: The Scotland Yard detectives

Foreign trip: The investigators were seen in a crowded street in the city of Faro, where they met local police

Probe: The men walked into a building in the city centre after they were spotted in a crowded street

‘They talked for about three hours and then went for lunch.

‘The British are desperate to interview three burglars that were in Praia da Luz at the time of Madeleine’s disappearance.

‘But they are also urging the Portuguese authorities find new evidence against the burglary suspects that could lead to arrests.’

Portugal’s Public Prosecutor Jose Magalhaes e Menezes has said his office will not be ‘an obstacle to solving the Madeleine case’.

The Portuguese authorities reopened their own investigation into the youngster’s disappearance in October last year.

Mystery: It is almost seven years since Madeleine McCann vanished in the holiday resort of Praia da Luz

Madeleine, who was then nearly four, disappeared from her family’s holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends.

It is now known that between January and May 2007 there had been a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area.

Police said in October last year that in the 17 days before she disappeared there was one burglary and one attempted burglary in the block where the McCann family were staying.
