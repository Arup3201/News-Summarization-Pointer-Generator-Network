Apparently being a world-renowned physicist, cosmologist, author, and ALS survivor isn't enough for Stephen Hawking -- he wants to be a movie star too.

In an interview with Wired magazine for the January issue, Hawking, 72, said he wanted to play a 'baddie' in a James Bond film, according to The Telegraph. 

'I think the wheelchair and the computer voice would fit the part,' he said.

Hawking is new to neither the big nor small screen though. 

The English doctor has been animated on 'The Simpsons', played himself in a cameo in 'Star Trek,' has appeared in the 'Monty Python' live series, and has even lent his voice to Pink Floyd tracks.

Hawking said in the interview that though his speech synthesizer gave him an American accent, it has become his 'trademark.' 

'Before I lost my voice, it was slurred, so only those close to me could understand, but with the computer voice, I found I could give popular lectures,' Hawking said. 

Hawking is currently the subject of 'The Theory of Everything,' a biopic that documents Hawking's time as an undergraduate, his marriage, and the onset of his motor neuron disease.
