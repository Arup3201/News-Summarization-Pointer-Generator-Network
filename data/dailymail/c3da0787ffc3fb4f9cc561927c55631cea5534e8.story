Ed Miliband is  facing a major backlash from his own party – with one MP warning his opposition to strikes in Syria could play into Putin’s hands.

The Labour leader said he would back limited military action against Islamic State in Iraq, but insisted conditions would need to be met for him to support raids in Syria – including a UN resolution, which Russia has pledged to veto.

Labour’s education spokesman Rushanara Ali resigned, saying she could not support air strikes.

The Labour leader is now facing a massive backlash from his own party - with one MP warning his opposition to strikes in Syria could play into Putin’s hands

And defence spokesman Vernon Coaker was forced to sack aide Iain McKenzie for voting against strikes in Iraq.

Mr Miliband said that it would be ‘better’ to have UN backing, and his aides suggested Barack Obama and David Cameron should plead with Mr Putin to drop his opposition.

Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander  insisted he had not made a UN resolution a ‘condition of future action’.

But a string of former ministers lined up to warn it makes no sense to support attacks in Iraq but not Syria. Former Cabinet minister Peter Hain said: ‘Allowing Isil to retreat across an invisible border, to them, which they control, into Syria and regroup is simply no answer.’

MP Ian Austin said: ‘Are we saying we will take action against terrorists responsible for beheading a British citizen on one side of the border, but would not target them if they scuttle a few yards across into Syria?’

He said the ‘genocidal’ actions of IS meant there was no need to seek the approval of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad or his ally Vladimir Putin.

He said: ‘It is really important we do not give any impression that Putin . . . has got a veto of any sort.’

Pat McFadden, another former minister, said: ‘If the Government’s position is it is illegal or wrong to act in this way in Syria, then why is it not illegal or wrong for the United States?’

Former Foreign Office minister Meg Munn said she was ‘deeply troubled’ by Britain standing on the sidelines. Labour said Mr Miliband was not ‘blocking’ action on Syria. But with the Prime Minister wary of acting without Labour, many fear he is effectively wielding a veto by setting these conditions.

Former Labour defence secretary John Hutton urged both men to consider sending in combat troops. He said: ‘I hope it doesn’t come to that. But I think it would be a very great mistake to signal to our enemy in advance the limits we are prepared to place now on the sort of support we might be prepared to give.’

Lord Dannatt, former head of the Army, said: ‘You can’t deal with half a problem and I think there will be an inevitable expansion into Syria.’

One of the country's first female Muslim MPs, Rushanara Ali quit the Labour frontbench after refusing to back support for air strikes in Iraq

Shadow education minister Rushanara Ali  quit the Labour frontbench after refusing to back Ed Miliband's support for air strikes in Iraq.

Elected in 2010 as one of the country's first female Muslim MPs, she defeated George Galloway, who was a major critic of new military intervention in Iraq.

Born in Bangladesh, her family moved to the East End when she was seven and she grew up in Tower Hamlets.

The 39-year-old worked as a researcher for former Bethnal Green MP Oona King from 1997-99, before joining the IPPR think tank.

In a letter to Mr Miliband ahead of the vote on Iraq, Ms Ali said: 'I understand the case that has been made and will not be voting against the motion.

'But I am unable in conscience to support the motion and I will make a deliberate abstention.'
