The grief-stricken girlfriend of a British student killed in the Alps plane tragedy has revealed a poignant last photo of the young couple together.

Anneli Tiirik took to Facebook to post the image of her final morning with Paul Bramley, 28. Alongside, she wrote: ‘Last morning with my love, my best friend, my protector, my prince.’

The photo emerged as Mr Bramley’s father made an emotional appeal for the 150 dead not to be forgotten and demanded airlines be more ‘transparent’.

Yesterday, a distraught Philip Bramley visited the monument erected near where the Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed. His son was one of three Britons who lost their lives.

Fighting back tears in Digne, close to where his son perished on Tuesday, Mr Bramley said: ‘What is relevant is that it should never happen again; my son and everyone on that plane should not be forgotten, ever. I don’t want it to be forgotten, ever.’

He added: ‘I believe the airlines should be more transparent and our finest pilots looked after properly. We put our lives and our children’s lives in their hands. 

'I want to see this cloud over this town lifted and the natural beauty be restored and not to be remembered by the action of a single person.’

Many people took to Facebook to offer Ms Tiirik condolences in response to the photo she posted, with one friend saying ‘he was the best guy you could ever meet’.

Emotional appeal: Philip Bramley, whose 28-year-old son Paul (seen in the photograph) was one of three Britons on board the ill-fated Airbus A320, said the 150 who lost their lives should 'not be forgotten'

Grief: Speaking at a memorial near the crash site in the French Alps, Mr Bramley (centre) fought back his tears as he talked about his son, who was returning from a short holiday in Barcelona on the doomed flight

Tribute: Paul Bramley told Sky News that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was 'ill' and his motivation for deliberately downing the plane was 'irrelevant'. Above, Mr Bramley holds a photo of his son at the victims' memorial

Ms Tiirik, who is from Estonia, replied: ‘Thank you! He was. It is a big loss for everyone. How it can [sic] be that the most lively and positive person there ever was can be taken from us in this way... I just don’t understand.’

Mr Bramley, from Hull, was studying hospitality and hotel management in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he was about to start an internship after travelling with Ms Tiirik. 

He had been to Barcelona after completing his first term of college for a few days’ holiday with friends.

Mr Bramley was flying back to the UK via Dusseldorf to see his family.
