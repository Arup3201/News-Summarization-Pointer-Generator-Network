A 23 year old 'cold-case' rape has been brought to trial thanks to new technology and the alleged victim's EastEnders habit.

The alleged victim, at the time a 20-year-old club cashier, was brutally attacked as she was on her way home from work in May 1990, a court heard.

Salvador Orozco, 49, is standing trial accused of dragging the woman into a derelict Gateshead railway yard and raping her.

Saving soap: It was this scene from a 1990 episode of EastEnders where Kathy Beale is raped by James Willmott-Brown which made the young woman take notes and ensure she preserved DNA following the attack

Following the supposed assault, the woman ensured she preserved DNA evidence on her body and made detailed notes, inspired by an episode of the BBC soap where character Kathy Beale is raped by bar owner 
James Willmott-Brown.

‘Kathy had been raped by Willmott-Brown and I remember watching the story,' she told a jury at Newcastle Crown Court.

‘I knew I had not to have a shower or bath and I knew it was important to remember as much as I could. When I got home I 
decided to make notes of everything that happened, step-by-step, so it 
would help me remember when I spoke to police.’

Orozco, previously of Bensham, Gateshead, was extradited from Hawaii earlier this year after a specialist team executed a warrant at his US home, a jury was told.

Prosecutors claim he approached the woman at Gateshead Metro Station on May 17, 1990, before brutally assaulting her in wasteland off Askew Road, in Gateshead.

Attack: The then 20-year-old was on her way home in May 1990 when she claims Orozco dragged her from the Gateshead Metro Station and brutally raped her

Speaking from behind a screen, the alleged victim told the court: ‘I felt an arm around my neck. I thought it was something messing about because you don’t think that something bad is going to happen to you. It was quite strong and I couldn’t get out and that’s when I realised it wasn’t a joke.

‘I was just saying, ‘Please, no. Please, stop it.’ It was terrifying. I was crying and sobbing and struggling and I was really worried that I was going to get hurt. I was paralysed.’

The jury was told that following the assault the woman’s attacker told her: ‘You must hate me, you must feel degraded.’

Following the assault Orozco is said to have covered his victim in her own coat, before threatening her towait ten minutes before contacting the ‘boys in blue’ so he could escape.

Gavin Doig, prosecuting, said: ‘The victim was first shocked, then terrified. She began to cry, to panic and to sob. The man told her he was going to make love to her, that she would like it.

‘She was begging him not to hurt her, 
not to kill her.’ He added: ‘At one point she looked around and the man 
hit her, saying: ‘Don’t look or I’ll slap you.’’

The
woman fled the scene and returned home before her husband discovered 
her wrapped in a duvet in the couple’s living room, the court heard.

Her
injuries were so severe that she vomited during a police interview and 
could not be examined by forensic scientists, it was said.

Case revived: Following the cold case review in 2002, alleged attacker Orozco could be extradited from Hawaii and is now facing trial on rape charges at Newcastle Crown Court

Over a decade later, advances in forensic science sparked a cold case review of the rape.

In 2002, DNA evidence was checked against the national DNA database where a match was discovered with Orozco’s two children.

'Scientific conclusions found that ‘the prospect of anyone other than the defendant having the DNA found at the time of the crime was one in a billion’, Mr Doig said, adding: ‘In short, it was [Orozco] who left it there.’

Orozco has admitted having sex with the woman but claims he lived a ‘promiscuous lifestyle’ and that the sex was consensual.

Mr Doig said: ‘The defence here is that he and victim decided jointly to go have sex having met near to the Gateshead bus station.

‘The defendant says he had a promiscuous lifestyle at the time. As a result he cannot now recall if they were already acquainted or if the victim decided she urgently wanted to have sex with him immediately upon meeting him that night.’

Following the attack the victim helped create a ‘rather accurate’ artist’s impression in a bid to catch her attacker, the court was told.

Orozco denies rape, attempted buggery and indecent assault. The trial continues.
