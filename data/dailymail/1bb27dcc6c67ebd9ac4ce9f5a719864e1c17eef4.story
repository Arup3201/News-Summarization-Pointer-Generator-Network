Citizens in Xalapa, Mexico have quite a decision to make July 7, when they cast their vote for mayor. One of their choices is a cat who vows to 'rid the city of rats.' Literally, but also in the sense of corrupt politicians.

In response to politics as usual, two students in the eastern Mexican city have nominated a cat named Morris for mayor.

If elected, they say Morris will eat, sleep, yawn and continue other cat activities as usual, which is what makes him a good candidate.

The contender: Morris has over 70,000 likes on his Facebook, far outpacing the human frontrunner of the mayoral race, Americo Zuñiga

'Candidates here almost never 
fulfill their promises,' said Jair Cueves, one of the students behind 
the Morris campaign to ABC News. 'Out candidate promises to sleep, eat, 
yawn and play in the dirt and that is what he will do if he wins the 
election.'

The students
set up a Facebook page and Twitter account for Candigato Morris, both 
of which have gone viral, becoming popular not only in Xalapa, but also 
across Mexico.

If 
Facebook likes are any indicator of popularity, then Morris is actually 
the lead in the race - by a lot. As of Saturday evening, Candigato 
Morris has over 70,000 likes, crushing the human frontrunner Americo Zuñiga's 30,000.

Cat got your vote?: Officials in Xalapa say that write-in votes for Morris will not be valid, but Morris' campaigners say writing him in anyway will make a point

Local journalist Melina Zurita believe that Morris' popularity is due to wide-spread disappointment in Mexican politics.

'The feelings [of frustration with politicians] are not just shared by people in Xalapa,' Zurita told ABC.

While Morris can't actually hold the office of Mayor of Xalapa, his campaign are urging people to write him in on election day anyway to make a statement about the city's politicians. While votes for Morris won't be valid, according to Xalapa officials, campaign officials believe continuing to vote for the cat will be a symbolic win.

Surprisingly, this isn't the first time a cat has won a mayoral election. In 1997, Stubbs a part-Manx cat was elected mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska, as a write-in candidate. While Stubbs was not allowed to officially hold the position, he was given the title of honorary mayor. Stubbs continues to hold that position today.
