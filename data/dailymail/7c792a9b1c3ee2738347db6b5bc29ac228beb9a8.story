Whitehall has wasted more than £5billion in just one year through errors, buying unused equipment and handing out compensation, a report has found.

The losses include nearly £300million for written-off vaccines, £6million on ear plugs which could not be used, and £4million on costs related to the early withdrawal of Sea King helicopters from service.

In one case, the Department for Education lost £1.2million because a school sent a payment to the wrong bank account, according to the report published today by the Taxpayers’ Alliance.

The new report also revealed that health spending which could have been avoided included £49million to exchange Tamiflu vaccines which were ordered in case of an avian flu epidemic – and are now out of date

Of all government departments, the Ministry of Defence had the biggest ‘avoidable losses’, at £3.1 billion in 2013-14, including spending on unsuitable or out-of-date equipment and IT systems.

These losses included the ear plugs, another £7.2million on a mobile mine-detection system ruled to be not fit for purpose, and £24million on ‘fruitless payments’ on Merlin aircraft components.

The Department of Health was found to have lost £761million, Work and Pensions could have saved £569million, and the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, £469million.

Health spending which the report says could have been avoided includes £49million to exchange Tamiflu vaccines which were ordered in case of an avian flu epidemic – and are now out of date.

Another £255million was said to have been spent by NHS England and hospital trusts on other vaccine write-offs although many of these have a short shelf life and need regular upgrading.

The survey of avoidable spending by government departments includes ‘special payments’ of compensation and legal fees which had not budgeted for - but amounted to around £157million.

For these payments, the largest bill was incurred the Home Office, at nearly £50million – of which £15.6million was for legal fees related to asylum seekers cases. And the Department of Health paid out £28.5million including payoffs for staff and costs related to the reorganisation of the health service.

Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘While in some cases closing a programme or getting out of a rental agreement early may make long-term sense, many of these losses are simply ludicrous and will seriously damage the trust taxpayers have in Whitehall civil servants.

‘It is clear there remains far too much waste in the system. With an ever-growing debt burden, we must make government more efficient and ensure taxpayers are getting real value for money.’

The think tank notes that some of these losses were not covered by department, but by other public sector bodies such as NHS trusts, HM Revenue and Customs or local government. 

Some losses will have been paid by one public sector body to another, but all are losses which, according to Government guidance, ‘are items that ideally should not arise.’
