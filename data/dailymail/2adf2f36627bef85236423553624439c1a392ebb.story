Roberto Martinez claims Everton captain Phil Jagielka never paid any attention to the criticism of his performances in the early part of the season.

Jagielka has looked back to his best in recent weeks after a tough start to the campaign following a disappointing World Cup with England.

The Toffees have kept clean sheets in their last two matches against Lille and Aston Villa, and ahead of their trip to Burnley, Martinez insists centre-back Jagielka blanked those who blamed him for Everton's early defensive woes and believed in his own ability.

'I'd said Phil is at an outstanding level now,' Martinez said.

'Criticism shouldn't affect any player. As a team we wanted to start the season brightly, but we conceded cheaply.

'However you can see the reaction of the team and individual players.

'But I don't think as a manager you make decisions based on criticism. I don't think you need to take players like him out of the firing line or anything like that.

'It's been enjoyable to see his level of form, building partnerships with different players.

'The whole back four have had a good defensive focus.

'We are stronger now than at the beginning of the season. It's been great to see the squad growing from the beginning.'

Everton have no fresh injury concerns after their Europa League draw against Lille, and Martinez also revealed that Costa Rica defender Bryan Oviedo is close to full fitness having only recently returned to first-team action following a long-term absence with a knee injury.

Martinez added: 'Bryan Ovideo is back with the group, and closer. Maybe he might not be ready for this weekend.

'We will have a clearer view on when Kevin Mirallas might be back after the next international break.'
