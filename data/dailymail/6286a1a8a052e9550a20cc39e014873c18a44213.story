These are the horrific images that hammer home the very real dangers of crystal meth.

But they are not the familiar compare-and-contrast images of junkies who have lost their looks.

Instead, they show the huge risks involved with making methamphetamine either at home or on the road.

The photos, which include a car in flames and an exploded house, have been released as researchers warn of a crude new method of manufacturing meth that poses a risk even to those who stay away from the drug.

It is filling hospitals with thousands
 of uninsured burn patients requiring millions of dollars in advanced 
treatment - a burden so costly that it is contributing to the closure of 
some burns units.

So-called 'shake-and-bake' meth is produced by combining raw, unstable ingredients in a two-litre bottle.

But if the person mixing the noxious 
brew makes the slightest error, such as removing the cap too soon or 
accidentally perforating the plastic, the concoction can explode, 
searing flesh and causing permanent disfigurement, blindness or even 
death.

A survey of key hospitals in 
America's most-active meth states showed that up to a third of patients 
in some burns units were hurt while making meth, and most were 
uninsured.

The average treatment costs $6,000 per
 day, but the average meth patient's hospital stay costs $130,000 - 60 
per cent more than other burns patients, according to a study by doctors
 in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

The influx of patients is 
overwhelming hospitals and becoming a major factor in the closure of 
some burns wards, according to the Associated Press report.

At least seven burns units across the 
U.S. have shut down over the past six years, partly due to consolidation
 but also because of the cost of treating uninsured patients, many of 
whom are connected to methamphetamine.

Burns experts agree that the annual 
cost to taxpayers is well into the tens if not hundreds of millions of 
dollars, although it is impossible to determine a more accurate number 
because so many meth users lie about the cause of their burns.

Larger meth labs have been bursting into flames for years, usually in basements, backyard sheds or other private spaces.

But those were fires that people 
could usually escape. Using the shake-and-bake method, drug-makers 
typically hold the flammable concoction up close, causing burns from the
 waist to the face.

Jason Grellner of the Franklin County, Missouri, Sheriff's Department, said: 'You're holding a flame-thrower in your hands.'

Also known as the 'one-pot' approach,
 the method is popular because it uses less pseudoephedrine - a common 
component in some cold and allergy pills.

It also yields meth in minutes rather 
than hours, and is cheaper and easier to conceal. Meth cooks can carry 
all the ingredients in a ruck sack and mix them in a bathroom stall or 
the seat of a car.

The improvised system first emerged 
several years ago, partly in response to attempts by many states to 
limit or forbid over-the-counter access to pseudoephedrine.

Since then, the shake-and-bake recipe has spread to become the method of choice.

By 2010, about 80 per cent of labs 
busted by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration were using 
shake-and-bake recipes, said Pat Johnakin, a DEA agent specialising in 
meth.

So instead of a large lab that 
supplies many users, there are now more people making meth for their 
personal use. The consequences are showing up in emergency rooms and 
burns wards.

Dr Michael Smock, director of the 
burns unit at Mercy Hospital St Louis, said: 'From what we see on the 
medical side, that's the primary reason the numbers seem to be going up -
 greater numbers of producers making smaller batches.'

It is impossible to know precisely 
how many people are burned while making shake-and-bake meth. Some avoid 
medical treatment, and no one keeps exact track of those who go to the 
hospital.

But many burns centres in the most 
active meth-producing states report sharp spikes in the number of 
patients linked to meth. And experts say the trend goes well beyond 
those facilities.

In Indiana, about three-quarters of 
meth busts now involve shake-and-bake. And injuries are rising sharply, 
mostly because of burns, said Niki Crawford of the Indiana State Police 
Meth Suppression Team.

Indiana had 89 meth-related injuries 
during the ten-year period ending in 2009. The state has had 70 in the 
last 23 months, mostly from shake-and-bake labs, Ms Crawford said.

What's more, meth-related burns often sear some of the body's most sensitive areas - the face and hands.

Dr Lucy Wibbenmeyer, of the burns centre at the University of Iowa, said:
 'I don't think a lot of these patients will be able to re-enter 
society. They'll need rehab therapy, occupational therapy, which is very
 expensive.'

Researchers at the University of Iowa
 found that people burned while making meth typically have longer 
hospital stays and more expensive bills than other burn patients - bills
 that are frequently absorbed by the hospital since a vast majority of 
the meth-makers lack insurance.

Doctors at Bronson Methodist Hospital
 in Kalamazoo, Michigan, performed a five-year study of meth patients in
 the early 2000s, then a follow-up study in 2009-2010.

Their investigation concurred with 
the Iowa findings. The Kalamazoo study also found that meth burn victims
 were more likely to suffer damage to the lungs and windpipe, spent more
 time on ventilators and needed surgery more often.

That report also found that only about
 10 per cent of meth patients had private insurance coverage, compared 
with 59 percent of other patients. And in many cases, their injuries 
leave them unable to work.
