As one of science’s greatest minds, Stephen Hawking has captured the imagination of millions across the world.

But, the physicist is almost as well known for his physical abilities as he is for his mental capacity.

Now, a documentary is set to be released telling the story of his incredible life.

The life of Stephen Hawking is to be featured in a new documentary released later this year

A trailer for ‘Hawking’ has been released and features the 71-year-old saying: ‘This is a personal journey through my life’.

It chronicles the rise of one of science’s most famous minds, and the conflict between the power of his mind and the frailty of his body.

He is almost entirely paralysed after developing Motor Neuron Disease at the age of 22 and famously speaks through a voice generator.

One contributor highlighted the unique power of Hawking’s scientific mind: ‘He could move at lightning speed across the frontiers of knowledge’.

Hawking was born in Oxford to parents Frank and Isobel Hawking during World War II. His mother was forced from their home in Highgate, London to give birth in relative safety.

Following his parents, Hawking’s attended Oxford University as his alma mater.

The documentary follows his time studying physics and chemistry there, and his meeting with wives Jane Wilde and Elaine Mason.

Describing his relationships, Hawking’s said: ‘Falling in love gave me something to live for’.

Hawking gained worldwide fame when 
his most famous work, A Brief History of Time, which has sold 8million 
copies, was released.

But, the impact on his life and relationships had been little discussed until now.

In his instantly-recognisable computerised voice, Britain's greatest 
living scientist told the Paralympics audience, 'Try to make sense of what you see, 
and wonder about what makes the universe exist'

As one of Britain's most powerful symbols of human triumph over 
adversity, Prof Hawking, 70, has lived with the debilitating illness 
motor neurone disease since the age of 22

He has since been featured on poplar television shows such as The Simpsons and Big Bang Theory.

Referring to his television appearances Hawking said ‘Maintaining a sense of humour has been vital to my survival’.

And, it is known that Hawking even told Richard Branson to hurry up and make the space shuttle before he can no longer fly in it.

Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Stephen Hawking in the 2004 drama ‘Hawking’, comments on the difficulty of his physical condition: ‘It’s a terrifying prospect to have a body that locks you in’.

Despite his illness, Hawking has managed to become one of the most respected scientific minds of the last century, and took pleasure in spreading his theories.

He said: ‘My proudest achievement is to encourage people to think about the cosmos and our place in it’.

The touching trailer promises a documentary with a personal insight into the life of a unique person.

It ends with Hawkings saying: ‘Because every day could be my last, I have a desire to make the most of each and every minute’.

'Hawking' is in cinemas from 20 September.
