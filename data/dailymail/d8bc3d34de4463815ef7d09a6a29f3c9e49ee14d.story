The Moroccan teenager at the centre of Silvio Berlusconi's sex-for-hire trial staged a protest outside Milan courthouse today demanding she be allowed to testify that the former Italian leader did not pay her to sleep with him.

Karima el-Mahroug, 19, better known as Ruby the Heartstealer, accused investigators of waging psychological warfare against her but admitted that she had lied in the past to hide her poverty-stricken origins.

Ms el-Mahroug read out a tearful, six-page statement denying she was a prostitute, saying she had never had sex with Mr Berlusconi and insisting that prosecutors hear her side of the story.

'I have nothing to be ashamed of and 
nothing to hide,' she said. She denounced what she called 'psychological
 torture' directed at her by people pretending to help her and also 
accused the media of having defamed her.

Mr Berlusconi is accused of having 
paid for sex with Ms el-Mahroug while she was a teenager during his 
infamous 'bunga-bunga' parties at his villa near Milan, and then trying 
to cover it up. Both deny sexual contact.

Her
 protest came at a politically sensitive time for Italy, as Mr 
Berlusconi's centre-right party is seeking to muscle its way into a 
governing coalition after coming in second in inconclusive February 
elections.

Parliament 
is also poised to elect a new president in the coming weeks, a highly 
politicised process given that the new president will have a major role 
to play in calling new elections if no government can be formed from 
Italy's top three squabbling political blocs.

Ms El-Mahroug has been the most pivotal character in Mr Berlusconi's legal woes, a one-time nightclub dancer who ended up at dinner parties at his home as his second marriage collapsed.

The scandal broke in 2010 when it emerged that Mr Berlusconi had intervened on Ms el-Mahroug's behalf after she was accused of stealing 3,000 euro (Â£2,500) from a friend and was detained by Milan police.

Mr Berlusconi said he did so thinking she was as a relative of Egypt's then-President Hosni Mubarak.

Ms El-Mahroug today showed an old passport that identified her last name as 'Mubarak' and said that bureaucratic error is why she often told lies and identified herself as a relative of the former Egyptian president.

She apologised for having created such 'fantasy' but said she did so to escape the 'poverty and suffering in which I was born into and grew up in before leaving my family in Sicily.'

Mr Berlusconi has frequently lashed out at what he calls politically-motivated cases mounted by Milan magistrates.
