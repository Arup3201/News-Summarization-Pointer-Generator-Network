Around three to seven per cent of children, or 400,000, are believed to have ADHD in the UK (picture posed by model)

More people than ever are being diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) -  a condition linked to impulsiveness, restlessness and hyperactivity.

But paediatric neurologist Dr Richard Saul believes that ADHD simply ‘doesn’t exist’ and is being used as a mask for less serious problems.

Around three to seven per cent of children, or 400,000, are believed to have ADHD in the UK, with many being prescribed drugs to try and improve their concentration at school.

Dr Saul argues all these children are being misdiagnosed and claims ADHD shouldn’t be listed in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM).

He claims that ADHD is nothing more than a collection of symptoms and not a disease, according to a report in the New York Post.

‘ADHD makes a great excuse,’ Dr Saul said in his book, ‘ADHD does not exist: The truth about Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder.’

‘The diagnosis can be an easy-to-reach-for crutch. Moreover, there’s an attractive element to an ADHD diagnosis, especially in adults - it can be exciting to think of oneself as involved in many things at once, rather than stuck in a boring rut.’

In his own practice, Dr Saul began looking for other causes of his patients’ symptoms.

He found cases such as a young girl who was unruly in school, but it turned out to be that she couldn’t see the blackboard and simply needed glasses.

A 36-year-old man who thought he had ADHD was just drinking too much coffee and not getting enough sleep.

Some cases produced no diagnosis. One adult, convinced she had ADHD and who had been given stimulants, realised it was simply life getting to her after being prescribed regular exercise.

Prescriptions for stimulant drugs such
 as Ritalin have increased twofold for children and adolescents in the 
UK with ADHD, and fourfold in adults between 2003 and 2008.

Such
 medications can cause adverse reactions such as weight loss, liver 
toxicity, and suicidal thoughts, and in the short term may suppress 
pubertal growth.

Echoing Dr Saul's views, a group of researchers from Australia and the Netherlands said in November that the diagnosis of ADHD may have become too broad.

A wider classification of symptoms for ADHD in the psychiatric ‘bible’ used by the profession has led to a steep rise in diagnosis and prescriptions for medication, the study warned.

The group of researchers said there was now a risk of over diagnosis which could fuel scepticism about the disorder.

In addition, stretched resources may mean some seriously affected children do not get medical help, or they are undertreated.

In a report published on bmj.com, they found a 73 per cent increase for ADHD medication in Austrla between 2000 and 2011.

To be diagnosed with ADHD, a patient 
should meet diagnostic criteria outlined in the American Psychiatric 
Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
(DSM-5) - used around the world to classify mental disorders - or the 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10).

But
 definitions have been broadened in successive editions of DSM, 
resulting in higher rates of the disorder when compared with ICD 10.

Although clinicians are likely to have got better at detecting and diagnosing ADHD, some of the rise could stem from over diagnosis or misdiagnosis.

‘Severe cases of ADHD are obvious, but in mild and moderate cases - which constitute the bulk of all ADHD diagnoses - subjective opinions of clinicians differ’, said Dr Rae Thomas, a senior researcher at Bond University in Australia.

‘The broadening of the diagnostic criteria in DSM-5 is likely to increase what is already a significant concern about overdiagnosis.

‘It risks resulting in a diagnosis of ADHD being regarded with scepticism to the harm of those with severe problems who unquestionably need sensitive, skilled specialist help and support’ she added.

Prof Eric Taylor, Emeritus Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, King’s college London, said the UK was different because NHS guidelines already recommend careful specialist assessment, with psychological treatments given priority over medication in most cases.

‘Probably too few children here get help’ he said.

In the UK, the increase in stimulants was from a very low base rate: 4.8 per 1,000 schoolchildren in UK compared with around 70 per 1,000 in parts of the U.S.
