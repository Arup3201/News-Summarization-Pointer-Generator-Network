If those fine lines on your face appear to be multiplying, it may be that your mother is to blame.

Scientists have found a set of genes passed down only by mothers that appear to influence the ageing process.

When the inherited DNA is defective, the result is premature ageing – not only wrinkles but a shorter lifespan – a study says.

The researchers discovered that damage to our mitochondria – the tiny powerhouses in our cells that turn the food we eat into energy – speeds up age-related conditions.

Teams from Sweden and  Germany found 
the ageing process is influenced not only by the  accumulation of 
mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) damage during a person’s lifetime, but also by 
any genetic mutations inherited from their mother.

Normal and damaged DNA  is passed down from generation  to generation.

But while the DNA that influences how
we develop comes from both parents and is held within a cell nucleus, 
the genes in mitochondria are entirely separate and come only from our 
mother.

Following experiments on  mice, the 
researchers found defective mDNA can result in serious genetic diseases.
But even mild inherited damage can accelerate the ageing process.

Writing in the journal Nature, lead 
researcher Professor Nils-Goran Larsson from the Karolinska Institute in
Sweden, said: ‘Our mother’s mitochondrial DNA seems to influence our 
own ageing. If we inherit mDNA with mutations from our mother, we age 
more quickly.

‘Ageing is the accumulation  of 
various types of cell damage. Much of the damage will be a result of 
environmental and lifestyle  factors, which means the inheriting mDNA 
damage can never be  the only explanation for ageing. But it is an 
important part of the ageing process.’

Mitochondria, the power houses of every cell, may be responsible for how we age

Defective mDNA is implicated in a 
host of age-related diseases such as heart problems, diabetes and 
neurodegenerative conditions including dementia. Over the course of our 
lifetime mDNA is more susceptible to damage than normal DNA, the 
researchers said.

When inherited mutations are added to those that occur naturally, it can cause us to age prematurely.

Ageing comes about as a result of 
damage to the body’s cells, making it more likely for an individual to 
suffer from an age-related disease or condition such as cancer, heart 
problems – as well as wrinkles.

Professor Doug Turnbull of Newcastle 
University, an expert on mitochondria, said: ‘This is very interesting. 
The genes you inherit can have some effect on the ageing process, but 
the most important factor still remains your lifestyle.’

Although damaged mDNA passed down 
from a mother to children could influence the ageing process, it is 
still unclear to what extent. But the research could help scientists 
find ways to slow the ageing process in humans using drug treatments, 
diets or supplements.

A co-author of the study, Dr Barry 
Hoffer of Case Western Reserve Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, said 
various foods and drugs can counter mitochondrial damage, including 
antioxidants.
