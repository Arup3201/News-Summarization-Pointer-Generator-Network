Experts speculate that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie could still launch a presidential run - despite a series of apparent denials.

Vaguely answering a supporter who pleaded with him to enter the race at an event in Simi Valley, California, last night he said, 'I thank you for what you're saying, and I take it in and I'm listening 
to every word of it and feeling it too.'

Critics say that is not a direct no and he could still launch a dramatic last minute bid for the White House.

Impassioned: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie speaks during the Perspectives on Leadership Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California on Tuesday

Speaking before a crowd of 1,000, 
including former First Lady Nancy Reagan, at the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library, a supporter pleaded with the impassioned governor 
to battle for the Republican nomination.

'Don't even say anything tonight, go 
home and think about it. Do it for my daughter, do it for our 
grandchildren, do it for our sons, please sir: we need you. Your country
needs you as president,' the supporter cried out from the crowd.

Should Chris Christie run for President?

Christie didn't say no, but pointed 
listeners to a video clip on Politico.com which had pieced together a 
long string of video clips of him saying he's not a candidate for the 
White House.

'Those are the answers,' he told the crowd.

Nonetheless, the speech - delivered at
a shrine to America's 40th president - was likely to stoke fresh 
speculation about his presidential ambitions.

'I hear exactly what you are saying and I feel the passion with which you say it,' Christie added.

'And so my answer to you is just this:
I thank you for what you're saying, and I take it in and I'm listening 
to every word of it and feeling it too,' he said.

The Republican governor warned that 
the nation's credibility abroad was being damaged by troubles at home. 
He charged that an indecisive White House has deepened the nation's 
economic pain, and he accused President Obama of preparing to divide the
country to win re-election next year.

Christie didn't spare Congress: In a 
scathing indictment of Beltway politics, he said the failure to 
compromise, along with Obama's lack of leadership, had set the country 
dangerously off course.

In Washington 'we drift from conflict 
to conflict, with little or no resolution. We watch a president who once
talked about the courage of his convictions, but still has yet found 
the courage to lead,' Christie said.

'We watch a Congress at war with 
itself because they are unwilling to leave campaign-style politics at 
the Capitol's door. The result is a debt-ceiling limitation debate that 
made our democracy appear as if we could no longer effectively govern 
ourselves,' he said.

Christie's appearance came during a 
three-day national trip in which the governor is raising money for 
Republicans and networking with party rainmakers.

With a reputation as a blunt-talking 
budget-cutter, the Reagan stage gave Christie the opportunity to extend 
his influence in a party that views him as a rising star. His remarks 
could stoke a fresh round of speculation about his White House 
ambitions, but his brother was the latest confidante to tamp down talk 
of a presidential bid.

'I'm sure that he's not going to run,'
Todd Christie told The Star-Ledger of Newark, New Jersey. The newspaper
also reported that the governor told wealthy donors earlier on Tuesday 
in Santa Ana that he was not entering the race, echoing his previous 
statements.

Christie, the first Republican elected
New Jersey governor since 1997, repeatedly contrasted Reagan's 
leadership skills with the dysfunction in Washington. Obama has 
positioned himself as a compromiser and deal-maker, but Christie cited 
his work in Trenton as the successful model, saying 'leadership and 
compromise is the only way you reform New Jersey's pension and health 
benefits system.'

He mocked Obama as 'a bystander in the
Oval Office' who was preparing to divide the nation along economic 
lines to win another four years in Washington, apparently alluding to 
the president's jobs bill, which proposes that wealthy Americans and big
corporations pay more in taxes.

Obama is 'telling those who are scared
and struggling that the only way their lives can get better is to 
diminish the success of others,' Christie said. He's 'insisting that we 
must tax and take and demonize those who have already achieved the 
American Dream.'

After the speech, Christie was asked 
repeatedly during a question-and-answer session if he would reconsider a
presidential run. He declined, as he has many times before.

The deadline for registering for the Florida primary is October 31.

Meanwhile, the age-old question of 'Will Sarah run?' may be answered within the next few days as the chief of Sarah Palin's political action committee told The New York Times that she is ‘on the verge’ of a decision.

Palin appears to be waiting for the last minute, as several state deadlines loom between mid-October and early November for the Republican Party to submit their candidates.

With the clock ticking, Mrs Palin’s aides tell The Times that they are ready to move quickly if she decides to run.
