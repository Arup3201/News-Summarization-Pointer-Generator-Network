Fast food giant McDonalds will trial late-night home delivery in Victoria, prompting concerns from a health campaigner about the easy accessibility to unhealthy food.

A McDonalds store in South Melbourne will begin to offer the delivery service late next month, with other locations expected to follow.

There will be a minimum $25 on order and a $4.95 delivery fee, which customers can place online, and will cater for customers in a 2.5km radius including South Melbourne, Port Melbourne and Albert Park.

Hervey Bay residents will be able to order McDonald's to their front doorstep which has incensed medical professionals as the town has an obesity crisis

Deliveries will operate from Sunday to Thursday from 5pm-11pm and Friday to Saturday from 5pm-10am the following morning, the Herald Sun reports.

The McDelivery service is already being tested at two Sydney stores.

But Obesity Policy Coalition executive manager Jane Martin has concerns about the easy accessibility to 'unhealthy' food.

Population growth in the Hervey Bay region was the main reason for the fast food chain to decide to run the trial seven days a week

'The concern is it creates even more convenience. It’s expanding the market at a time when people are already eating poorly, particularly young men who consume large amounts of chips and burgers,' Ms Martin said.

Many of the items on McDonalds regular menu will be available with the delivery service, including Big Macs, french fries and healthy options like wraps and salads.

There will be a minimum $25 on order and a $4.95 delivery fee, which customers can place online, and will cater for customers in a 2.5km radius including South Melbourne, Port Melbourne and Albert Park
