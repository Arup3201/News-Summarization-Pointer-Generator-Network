A baby girl was found alive after being strapped in her car seat upside down for 14 hours while inside a partially submerged car in Utah's Spanish Fork River - but her mother did not survive the crash.

Lily Groesbeck, 18 months old, was listed in stable but critical condition at Primary Children's Hospital on Sunday.

Her mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, 25, from Springville, was found dead in the car, according to police.

A fisherman found the crashed car upside down in the river on Saturday at 12.30pm, about 14 hours after the accident occurred around 10.30pm on Friday.

A neighbor in the area reported hearing a loud noise near the bridge Friday night at about 11pm, but couldn't locate the cause of the sound after checking the area near Provo.

The red Dodge Caliber struck a cement barrier on the bridge and careened into the river, according to investigators.

The car then landed under the bridge and was difficult to see from the road.

Emergency responders who arrived at the scene on Saturday found the car on its top, partially submerged in the river.

Groesbeck was found dead in the driver's seat but Lily was alive, seated above the freezing waters in the rear passenger seat - as the low-to mid 30-degree-temperature water never reached high enough to touch her.

The child was first taken to Mountain View Hospital and then flown to Primary Children's Hospital in critical condition.

'She is doing remarkably well considering the circumstance. The doctors have been hopeful so far,' said Lynn's sister, Jill Sanderson on Sunday. 'We would like to express our appreciation to the Spanish Fork rescue team for saving the baby's life.'

Sanderson said her sister was enrolled at Provo College with a goal of becoming a medical assistant, and had lived in the Provo area her entire life, according to KSL.

Lynn was also the youngest of five children, including three brothers and her sister.

'She was very compassionate and a very loving person and always willing to bend over backwards for her loved ones,' said Sanderson. 'Her baby was the love of her life. She was an amazing mother.'

Mystery: Police said she was driving home from her parent's house in Salem Friday night when the accident happened

Officials with the Spanish Fork Police Department said Groesbeck was visiting her parents in Salem, Utah leaving their house around 10pm, and was returning to her home when the crash occurred on Friday night.

'I have been able to confirm that she had visited some family in Salem [Friday] night around 10 o'clock,' Lt Cory Slaymaker of the Spanish Fork Police Department told Fox 13. 

'She left Salem between 10:00 and 10:30 last night, was heading home to Springville, the family didn't know that she did not arrive.'

A neighbor heard the crash around 11pm, but couldn't find any signs of an accident on the roadway.

'Where the car was at, you couldn't see it from the roadway,' Slaymaker said.

The temperature of the Spanish Fork river was so cold that three police officers and four firefighters who responded to the crashed car had to be treated for hypothermia at the hospital. They were all later released.

The cause of the accident is still under investigation.
