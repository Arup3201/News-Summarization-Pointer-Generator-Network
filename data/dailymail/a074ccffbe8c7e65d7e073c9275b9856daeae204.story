The far-right National Front made massive gains across France as Socialist president Francois Hollande faced humiliation in local elections.

Marine Le Pen, the leader of the anti-immigration and anti-Europe party, described it as a  ‘breakthrough’ in the fight against the corruption and apathy of mainstream parties.

The National Front won an outright majority in the northern town of Henin-Beaumont and was first-placed in the eastern town of Forbach and the southern towns of Avignon, Perpignan and Beziers.

Mr Hollande's Socialists were meanwhile heading for heavy losses as voters punished them for the disastrous economic situation.

There was even talk of a vote of no confidence in the bumbling head of state who is easily the most unpopular president in the history of modern France.

Almost 45 million French people took to the polls to elect more than 36,000 mayors for the next six years in what was being seen as a test for the Socialist president, whose approval rating has sunk as low as 17 per cent.

The National Front hopes to increase its municipal councillors from around 50 to 1,000, and to win control of as many councils as possible.

It was heading to be kingmaker in up to 200 towns where its candidates were on course to reach round two by winning more than 10 per cent of the vote.

If no candidate wins more than 50 per cent of the vote in round one, the race goes to a run-off.

The Socialists were pinning their damage limitation hopes on retaining Paris, where Anne Hidalgo, their Spanish-born candidate, was on course to become the city’s first female mayor.

Some 389 Britons are running for municipal councillor under a 2001 rule in which other European Union nationals can seek town hall posts, but they require French nationality to become mayor.

Some 30 percent of voters have indicated they intend to punish the government for its failures on key issues such as soaring unemployment.

Mr Hollande’s hugely embarrassing private life, which saw him effectively fire his first lady this year after being caught out with a secret lover, has also played against him.

Ms Le Pen won almost 18 per cent of the national vote in the first round of presidential elections two years ago, and has worked hard to ‘detoxify’ the party’s racist and anti-Semitic image.
