The Liverpool squad began arriving at Anfield seven hours before before kick-off ahead of their Europa League last-32 clash against Besiktas on Thursday.

Brendan Rodgers' side were dumped out of the Champions League at the group stage after returning to Europe's top club competition for the first time since 2009-10.

Liverpool were beaten by Real Madrid twice and Basle, while draws against the Swiss champions and Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets left the Anfield club third in Group B.

But Liverpool return to Europe on Thursday night as they face the Turkish league leaders in the first leg of the knockout tie.

Members of the squad including Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson were pictured arriving at Anfield shortly after midday as the Reds look to take their impressive Premier League form into European competition.

Liverpool are unbeaten in their last nine in the league, a run that has rescued their season and left Brendan Rodgers' side in contention of securing a top-four finish.

And the former Swansea manager will be looking upon the Europa League as another opportunity to secure Champions League football next season with the winner of the often-derided competition earning a seat at Europe's top table for the 2015-16 season.

Meanwhile, Adam Lallana revealed he regrets the manner of his departure from Southampton but insists he never refused to play for the club in order to secure his exit.

The 26-year-old, who spent 12 years with Saints, became the subject of a protracted and high-profile transfer saga last summer with the Reds making three separate bids before they were successful.

In between those offers there was speculation Lallana had tried to force Southampton's hand by issuing an ultimatum but the player denies that.

A deal in the region of £25m was finally agreed but the acrimonious manner of his departure still rankles with fans, who were not assuaged by a full page advert Lallana placed in the local newspaper offering his thanks.

He returns to St Mary's on Sunday where he expects to get a less-than-warm welcome.

'I'm not stupid enough to think the way I left didn't leave a sour taste in a few people's mouths,' he told BBC Radio Solent

'I regret the way I left. I regret bits and pieces of how it happened and it got nasty. It was sad the way it happened.

'What is true is that when I knew of Liverpool's interest and that they had put a bid in, I did say to the club it would be my wish if they could negotiate a fee for me to move on.

'Not for one second did I say I wouldn't play for the club again. I'm man enough to say it was my choice and my decision for me to move on.

'Deep down I hope Saints fans appreciate the times we had at the club together.

'Football is a fickle game - if I do get the jeers and the boos I'm just going to take it as them missing me playing down there because I miss Southampton.

'I miss the fans and I miss the good times we had down there. Of course I do.'

Lallana missed the game at Anfield through injury and he admits it will be a strange feeling lining up against his former side this weekend.

'It's still not sunk in that I'm going to be playing against Southampton,' he added.

Lallana joined Liverpool from Southampton last summer for a fee in the region of £25m

'I think it was a blessing in disguise that I was injured for the first game.

'Even being in the crowd watching that day I just felt really emotional so to have been out there would have been way too soon.

'The rawness of it all has got easier over the past six months.

'I've got huge respect for the club; part of me doesn't even know how I'm going to play. It's all a bit surreal.

'I just have to be professional and play well for Liverpool. I've got too much respect to celebrate (if he scores).'
