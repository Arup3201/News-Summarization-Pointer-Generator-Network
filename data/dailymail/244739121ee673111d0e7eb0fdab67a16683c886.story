A former homeless crack addict who found fame four years ago after a YouTube video catapulted him to overnight fame has revealed that he is broke despite a six-figure book deal and a voice over contract with Kraft.

Ted ‘Gold Voice’ Williams became a media sensation when he was filmed panhandling in Columbus, Ohio in December 2010 with a sign reading: 'I'm an ex-radio announcer who has fallen on hard times'.

The once-successful DJ was recorded performing a voice-over by a local reporter and the video went viral, receiving more than 20 million views on YouTube.

Ted ‘Gold Voice’ Williams, a former homeless crack addict who found fame four years ago after a YouTube video of him went viral, has said he is broke despite a $375,000 book deal in 2012

With his story garnering national coverage, Williams found himself with a home, radio job offers - and money for the first time since he had moved into a tent in the woods 17 year earlier as an addiction to crack cocaine took over his life.

The notoriety that followed his amazing comeback led to numerous voice-over jobs, including one as the spokesman for Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. 

Two stints in rehab have helped him deal with first his cocaine abuse and then issues with alcohol, but problems remain in his life.

'I should have been a millionaire by now,' he told The Columbus Dispatch after a recent appearance on a Marion, Ohio, radio station, where he has a weekly show.

Inspiration: Williams now spends part of his time visiting homeless shelters and offering support to other people in the position that he once found himself

Despite receiving a $375,000 book advance for a biography, A Golden Voice: How Faith, Hard Work, And Humility Brought Me From The Streets To Salvation, Williams admits he is broke. 

'I own nothing,' he said, adding that he doesn't have furniture or a car.

The situation was very different in 2011 when Williams first found fame and lived in hotels paid for by an agent. After that he moved into a rented condominium owned by another agent, but now he lives in an apartment and admits he owns no furniture.

‘Financially I'm a little under the weather. I lot of things I signed in 2011 I  probably shouldn't have signed,’ he said.

Williams admits he ‘wasn't focused’ and ‘trusted too much’ in managers who he now believes didn't have his best interests at heart.

He now says his Christian faith has helped him cope with his resentment and anger about what has happened. 'I’m still very fragile in my recovery,' he said. 

In the 1980s, Williams had been a successful radio show host on a top-rated morning show in Columbus, but then he slid into a life of homelessness and drug abuse for 17 years and lived in a tent

In the 1980s, Williams had been a successful radio show host on a top-rated morning show in Columbus, but then he slid into a life of homelessness and drug abuse for 17 years until the YouTube video gave him a second chance.

Williams has had other struggles since 2010 and initially turned to alcohol.

'I figured since it wasn’t my drug of choice, alcohol could be my new drug,' Williams told the Today show in 2012. 

'I could go and start drinking, and nobody would know. Everybody would know [if] Ted was on crack, but they wouldn’t know that Ted was drinking.' 

When he appeared on the Today show he had just achieved one year of sobriety and was celebrating by walking his daughter down the aisle at her wedding. 

'I was able to be a part of that, something that a year and a half ago I wouldn’t have even thought about, let alone become a part of,' he said.
