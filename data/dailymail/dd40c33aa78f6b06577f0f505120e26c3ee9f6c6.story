It's not every day Pope Francis calls to wish you a happy New Year, so it might be a good idea to be at home when he rings up.

But the problem for a group of Spanish nuns was they were busy praying when the Pontiff left a voicemail asking why they didn't pick up.

'What can the nuns be doing that stops them answering the phone?' said Pope Francis, chuckling, in the message he left on New Year's eve for the Barefoot Carmelites of Lucena.

Caller: Pope Francis left a message for the Barefoot Carmelite nuns of Luceno in southern Spain

'This is Pope Francis, I wanted to give you New Year's greetings. I'll see if I can reach you later. God bless you.'

Sister Adriana, the prioress of the convent near the southern town of Cordoba, told COPE radio station she and the four other nuns were not listening for the phone because they were busy at midday prayers.

'When my duties allowed me to go to the phone, I literally wanted to die' [on hearing the missed message], Adriana said.

'I
 took down the message and passed it on to the other nuns. We told 
ourselves we had just been fulfilling our duty of prayer. We never 
thought the Pope would remember us.'

Prayers: The Barefoot Camelite nuns found a message on their answerphone from the Pope

She
 frantically called a bishop and other contacts to try and return the 
call to the Vatican, without success, but Francis called back and 
managed to talk to the nuns in the evening.

The Pope was an old friend of some of the nuns in their group, who, like him, come from Argentina said the prioress.

The voicemail was broadcast on Spanish radio on Friday.
