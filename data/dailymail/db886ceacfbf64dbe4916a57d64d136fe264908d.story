France are the frontrunners to be England's second opponents during next summer's tour to Brazil.

Roy Hodgson takes his side to South America for a mini-tour in June to acclimatise to the conditions ahead of the 2014 World Cup. Out there the national side will two matches: one against five-time world champions Brazil with the other likely to be against France, although Uruguay have been mooted as an alternative to the French.

England's playing schedule is clear next summer, with no World Cup qualifying ties to play and the FA believe the trip will be a valuable experience for the squad, coming 12 months before the World Cup.

We're off to Brazil! England are set to go on tour to South America next summer

It is England’s first trip to Brazil since 1984, when John Barnes hit a wonder-goal in a 2-0 win.

The FA have also ensured the fixtures in South America will be completed in time for the players to have a decent close-season break, before the start of the new campaign and a qualifier against Moldova on September 6, 2013.

The Three Lions will fly out to South America the day after playing a friendly at Wembley on May 29 as part of their 150-year celebrations as a national association.

Should England qualify for the World Cup without the added difficulty of the play-offs, they will play two friendlies at Wembley in November 2013 as well as two further home clashes in March and May 2014.

But Hodgson warned: ‘Brazil has got a major logistical problem on its hands. It’s a vast country, I don’t think we realise quite how vast.

‘There’s going to be enormous difficulties for the teams that qualify, according to where they are drawn.

‘You’ve got to remember it’s the Brazilian winter, so it’s not going to be a particularly sun-bathing time unless you happen to find yourself in Rio.’

What a goal: England have not played in Brazil since John Barnes waltzed through the home defence to score in a 2-0 win at the Maracana in June 1984

England have slipped a place to sixth in the FIFA rankings, with Northern Ireland the only of the home nations to improve their standing.

Euro 2012 finalists Italy, the side who eliminated England in that competition, replace Roy Hodgson’s side in the top five.

England played two World Cup qualifiers in the eligibility period, with a regulation 5-0 win over San Marino and 1-1 draw in Poland.

Spain and Germany remained unmoved in first and second, with Argentina climbing into third above Portugal, who slip to fourth following their surprise home draw against the Northern Irish.

Michael O’Neill’s men enjoyed a leap of 17 places thanks to that result, moving to 100 in the standings.

The Republic of Ireland slipped eight spots to 36th after a 6-1 hammering by Germany.

Scotland, who sacked Craig Levein as manager this week, have dropped below Wales after being beaten 2-1 in their head-to-head match last month.

Scotland drifted by 14 to 70th while a 2-0 defeat in Croatia meant Wales also dropped from 57th to 66th.

Elsewhere Fabio Capello’s Russia have moved into the top 10 after a strong start to their World Cup qualifying campaign.
