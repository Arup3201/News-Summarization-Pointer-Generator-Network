Friends and neighbours say they’re stunned by the shooting murder of 75-year-old  great grandmother Helen Dawson Key in her Toongabbie home last week, describing her as a ‘well-liked lady' and a respected member of her close-knit community.

Mrs Dawson Key's body was found just inside her home in western Sydney, about 10am last Thursday (November 20). Authorities  confirmed she was shot in the head; the bullet  passing through the front screen door before striking her.

Mrs Dawson Key had been a long-time member of the Toongabbie Sports and Bowling Club and was Vice President of the Ladies Bowling Club for the last fourteen years.

Friend and lawn bowls partner Mary Gibson said she couldn't understand how this could happen to  'a very, very nice lady.'

'I've only been here 12 months but Helen was a very well-liked lady, played bowls, we still don't know why,' Ms Gibson told Daily Mail Australia.'What I do know is she was a lovely person and I really loved playing bowls with her. Each week we'd have a different partner but I loved playing with her.'

Mrs Dawson Key's next-door neighbour of 14 years, Zhu Kayw, says she called the police after hearing a shot last Thursday morning. 

'We just heard the shot, bang that's it, just one that's all,' she said. 

'There was no trouble before that - very quiet, even the dog was not barking,' he said.

'She lived alone, her partner passed away a few years ago.

'We would just meet and say hello when we collect the rubbish bins and bills - we would say "hello, how are you? She was very friendly, yes.'

Another woman who lives just two doors down from Mrs Dawson Key's house in Paris Place said neighbours were in shock. 

'Yes it's terribly sad but as residents we're not really speaking about it out of respect for Helen,' she said. 'Not that we know anything really anyway, to offer anything new.'

Police say Mrs Dawson Key, who has lived alone for several years, could have been dead for up to 16 hours before she was found behind her front door.

Homicide Squad Commander, Detective Superintendent Michael Willing, said police were still trying to determine why Mrs Dawson Key was targeted.

'Mrs Dawson Key had no known links with crime, no known enemies, and by all accounts was a well-liked and highly-regarded member of the local community,' Det Supt Willing said.

'Mrs Dawson Key’s front door was open, but her screen door was shut, so we think she might have answered a knock at the door. 

'She had lived at this address for more than 30 years and had strong links with her neighbours and a local bowling club.

'We are, frankly, at a loss as to why someone would want to target her.'

'I loved playing bowls with her': Helen Dawson Keys developed 'many strong friendships' as Vice President of the Toongabbie Ladies Bowling Club for the past 14 years

In a statement today, the Toongabbie Sports and Bowling Club confirmed Mrs Dawson Key was found by a concerned friend and club member who noted her absence at a recent event. 

Something 'reflective of the friendships Helen had formed at the club, and the tight knit friendships within the community,' it read.

'Helen Dawson was a valued and respected part of the Toongabbie community having been involved with the clubs Lady Bowlers for some 20 years. She was a committed member volunteering her time to co-ordinate the ladies activities and formed many strong friendships within the club,' the statement read. 

'The club's community is shocked and dismayed at the circumstances surrounding Helen’s death and cannot understand how a respected senior citizen and friend could come to harm in her own home.'  

Helen Dawson Key was found by a friend and member the Toongabbie Bowling Club, where she had been a member for more than 20 years 

Det Supt Willing said Strike Force Elermore had been established to investigate Mrs Dawson Key’s death and needed the community’s help.

'We believe Mrs Dawson Key was shot just prior to 6pm the previous day (Wednesday 19 November),' Det Supt Willing added. 

'What we’re asking is for anyone who was in the area around the time of Mrs Dawson Key’s death, or has information about her movements that day, to come forward.'
