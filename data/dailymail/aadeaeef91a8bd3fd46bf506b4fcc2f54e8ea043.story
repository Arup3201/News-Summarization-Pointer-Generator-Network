A new online reality show has launched that encourages singles to think outside the color box and 'date different'.

Swirlr, which is available to view on YouTube and runs alongside a website of the same name, features people looking to find love with those of other races.

The show is hosted by Christelyn Karazin, BeyondBlackWhite.com blogger, author of the book Swirling: How to Date, Mate, and Relate Mixing Race, Culture, and Creed.

Along with Jordan Harbinger, she takes the lead on matching candidates on the first episode.

Asked what the reaction has been, she told hlntv.com: 'Finally, that is the reaction. Everybody's like yes, at last, finally a show that reflects what we're doing, the diversity of America and how we're changing and how demographics are changing and how a global village has brought different people together in this wonderful melting pot, so we're very excited.

'What we get a lot is "finally" and "more and more and more".

'It's a show that nobody has to hold their breath and wait for the minority to be voted off and so I think what we want people to understand on the show is that we're all just people on the underneath.

'You can find love in a variety of different packages. With this show there is also an element of online dating, an online dating platform.

'With me and my relationship I embraced those differences and I think you're going to see a lot of that on the show.'

The first episode sees Kurt, from central California, who is studying and part-time modelling meet Quintana, an Atlanta, Georgia transplant and aspiring DJ.

Both come to Christelyn and Jordan for help in finding someone special.
