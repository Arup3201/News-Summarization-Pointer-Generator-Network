A council has paid sniffing experts £35,000 to monitor foul odours seeping from a waste processing plant.

The environmental consultants, 'with very sensitive noses', are assessing the scale of the stench which locals claim has plagued them since the Biffa plant opened at Mowmacre Hill, Leicester in 2003.

Specialists from Technology company SLY and consultancy firm RPS have been sniffing the air at the plant for the past 14 months.

Leicester City Council has paid for 'sniff consultants' to examine the odours to see if there's a problem after receiving 152 complaints about the waste plant which processes 120,000 tonnes of rubbish a year

Steve Weston, the head of waste management at Leicester City Council, said: 'We’ve paid for consultants to come and do sniff monitoring.

'They’re professional people with very sensitive noses - a bit like perfumers - who can detect small changes in the smell of the area. They’ve been doing random sniff tests and recording what they find.

'That’s the only way we’re going know whether there’s a problem. The consultants have also looked at the air evacuation systems and the bio-filter at the plant to assess their effectiveness. It’s cost us about £35,000 so far.'

Local MP Liz Kendall, pictured, said she was angry this odour problem was taking so long to resolve claiming she will do everything in her power to get the Environment Agency to intervene

Local residents complain that the Biffa waste management plant in Momacre Hill in Leicester is making their life a misery since it has opened in 2003. The facility treats 120,000 tonnes of rubbish a year

Since the 'sniff monitoring' started residents have complained 152 times about the waste plant, which processes 120,000 tonnes of rubbish each year.

Stewart Lewin, chairman of the Mowmacre Tenants and Residents’ Association, said: 'We can’t open our windows or our doors - it’s a sickly horrible smell and it’s about time something was done about it.'

Reg Hubbard, who lives close by, said: 'Biffa should be doing a lot more to make sure this stops. It’s not nice for anyone.

Information from the 'sniff monitoring' and the assessment of the plant’s filtration systems - which are designed to catch any smells before they escape - have been handed over to the Environment Agency.

Today, representatives from the agency, Biffa and the council will meet to discuss the findings of the report.

Mervyn Tongue, law enforcement officer for the Environment Agency, said: 'We’ve now taken receipt of the technical reports, which show some problems with the processing plant.

'We’ll meet Biffa to discuss the next steps.'

He said his agency has the power to force the company to find a solution, but added: 'I’m sure Biffa will want to resolve this as much as everyone else.'On Saturday, a meeting to update residents was chaired by Leicester West MP Liz Kendall.

Miss Kendall said: 'I’m so angry we’re still talking about this after so long.

'I will do everything in my power to make sure the Environment Agency uses its power to do something because we’re sick of having to meet like this all the time.'Biffa said it continues to cooperate fully with the authorities.
