Michelle Obama has once again flexed her muscles against a TV host, but this time she invited Jimmy Fallon to the White House to complete a series of fitness challenges.

She was competed against the host of 'Late Night with Jimmy Fallon' in push-ups, 
tug-of-war and dodgeball, as well as a final battle in the form of an amusing sack race.

She is promoting her ‘Let’s Move’ initiative, which encourages healthy eating 
and keeping physically fit for American kids.

Arriving at the White House: The First Lady challenged the host of 'Late Night with Jimmy Fallon' to push-ups, tug-of-war and dodgeball, as well as an amusing sack race

Flexing muscles: The First Lady is famed for her press-up performance and she didn't disappoint, doing more reps than Jimmy Fallon who looked like he was struggling

Show of strength: Mrs Obama took Fallon on in a game of tug of war, in the Blue Room of the White House

Little help: Although it looked like Mrs Obama was winning, the camera pulled out and revealed she had some help in the form of a tall suited member of staff

Fallon opened the segment in the studio,
which aired on NBC by explaining on his show 'we 
make exercise and staying healthy a top priority.'

He continued, 'We're also big fans of the First Lady's 'Let's Move' initiative, which encourages kids to get active.'

The NBC host said that he 'connected' with a clip of Obama when she stated she is 'pretty much willing to make a complete fool out of myself to get our kids moving.'

Fallon then said, 'I make a fool of myself every night, so I decided to go down there and help the First Lady out.'

Move those hips: The next challenge was using hula-hoops 
and Mrs Obama had a stern look on her face as she swiveled her hips, but
was beaten by Fallon

Watch out: In the dodgeball challenge, Mrs Obama was victorious after she hit Fallon in the face with the ball and he fell to the floor

Greeting Fallon at the White House, the First Lady asked, 'Are you ready for a little competition?'

They then began their series of fitness tests, starting with a press-up contest.

Mrs Obama already competed against TV show hostess Ellen deGeneres earlier this year, proving she can do 25 sit-ups without breaking a sweat.

And yet again she proved when she flexes her muscles, she means business and beat Fallon who looked like he was struggling.

In the tug-of-war, it appeared Mrs Obama was winning, but when the camera 
pulled out, it revealed she had some help in the form of a tall suited 
member of staff

The next challenge was using hula-hoops and Mrs Obama had a stern look on her face as she swiveled her hips, but was beaten by Fallon.

Mrs Obama won the dodgeball competition, after she managed to knock the TV host in the face and then suggested a potato sack race to end the battle.

Final battle: Although Fallon didn't look too pleased about doing the sack race, he nearly edged forward towards the finishing line

But yet again Mrs Obama won and broke the finish line tape, leaving Fallon laying on the floor

Strange scene: Bo Obama even made an appearance in the sketch, watching as Jimmy Fallon strutted along the White House corridors in his bright blue gym kit

Although Fallon didn't look too pleased about partaking in the sack race, he nearly edged forward towards the finishing line, but yet again Mrs Obama won and broke the yellow tape, leaving Fallon laying on the floor. 

Once the battles were over, a defeated Fallon said, 'It doesn't matter if you won or lost,' the First Lady replied, 'It matters!' 

Mrs. Obama has been making the talk-show rounds to celebrate the second anniversary of her campaign against childhood obesity.

In the recent past weeks 
she stepped up her ‘Let’s Move’ initiative with appearances on Late Night 
with Jay Leno, Rachael Ray and Ellen DeGeneres.

When she appeared with Jay Leno on 'The Tonight Show' she brought him some healthy snacks.
