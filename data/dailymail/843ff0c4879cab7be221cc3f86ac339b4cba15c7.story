Manchester City want Vincent Kompany to finish his career at the club and will offer him a package totalling £60million for the privilege.

The 28-year-old only signed his last deal at the Etihad Stadium in 2012 but Manuel Pellegrini wants the central defender to pen a new contract worth £200,000-a-week for the next six years. 

Kompany, linked with Barcelona this summer, has been at the bedrock of City's back four since joining from Hamburg in 2008.

And while the Premier League champions are close to clinching the signature of Porto's Eliaquim Mangala in what has been the summer's most protracted transfer, the club captain will remains City's main man. 

Mangala will move to Manchester for £32m as Pellegrini looks to shore up a defence that looked shaky in spells last season.

While Martin Demichelis' form improved drastically in the run-in, City want a viable long-term option and Matija Nastasic hasn't kicked on as hoped, largely down to persistent injuries. 

As for Kompany, the Belgian looks set to pocket another £5m by way of contractual bonuses.
