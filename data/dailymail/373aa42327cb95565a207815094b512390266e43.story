Toast Of New York has been ruled out of the Dubai World Cup at Meydan on March 31 after suffering a setback.

A stunning winner of the UAE Derby on World Cup night last March, Jamie Osborne's stable star ended his three-year-old campaign with a fantastic effort in defeat when beaten just a nose by Bayern in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita in November.

Sheikh Joaan Al Thani's Al Shaqab Racing operation stepped in to buy the colt earlier this year, and Osborne had been preparing him for a tilt at the world's richest race where he would have been ridden by Frankie Dettori.

Toast Of New York is, however, now set for a spell on the sidelines.

The trainer said: 'He's had a setback and, sadly, he's going to miss the World Cup. I have to speak to the Al Shaqab team and I'm sure we'll be formulating another plan.

'It's very disappointing for Sheikh Joaan and his team, and obviously for everybody here but he'll be back.’
