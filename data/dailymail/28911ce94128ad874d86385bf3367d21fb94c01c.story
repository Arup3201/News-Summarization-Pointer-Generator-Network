An unknown law graduate has been picked as the lead vocalist for a charity song that will be the soundtrack for the tear-jerker Christmas TV ad from Waitrose.

The supermarket’s commercial is a shift from its normal festive marketing campaign which in the past has been fronted by the Michelin star celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal.

This weekend will see a raft of high street stores launch their Christmas TV commercials using a mix of celebrity and schmaltz in order to capture a share of family festive spending.

The Waitrose Christmas ad will be aired this Sunday and features a relatively unknown law graduate as the soloist, as well as 10-year-old Blaise Allen and employee Jummy Sanusi in place of the usual cast of celebrities

Beth Pennell, aged 23, from Chester was one of thousands of people who donated their voice to be used in the Waitrose soundtrack, which is a version of the Dolly Parton hit ‘Try’.

She was astonished to discover that the producer of the song David Kosten, who has worked with some of the world’s biggest stars, including Chris Martin of Coldplay, wanted to use her as the lead vocalist.

The song, which is effectively created from a national choir of amateurs, will be released as a charity single raising money for Age UK, Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity and The Trussell Trust, which supports food banks. 

Waitrose has taken the lead from the successful Christmas commercials of its parent company John Lewis by creating a short story designed to appeal to the emotions.

It tells the story of a girl, portrayed by Blaise Allan, aged 10, from Kent, who struggles to make gingerbread biscuits for a fund-raising school fayre.

After several failures, she is helped by a Waitrose employee, 25-year-old Jummy Sanusi, who lives in Ilford and works at the chain’s branch in Canary Wharf.

The commercial delivers a happy ending with a successful stall at the school event, while the little girl goes back to see Jummy with a thank you gift of a gingerbread biscuit.

Beth, who graduated with a first in law from Liverpool John Moore’s university, has recently got a job with a law firm in Chester and views singing as a hobby she enjoys rather than a career.

‘I used to sing in High School, but haven't done much since then. I'm mainly a shower singer,’ she said.

‘I recently got given some time in a recording studio as a birthday present by my mum and have put together several songs on a soundcloud page, but it was very much just for fun, rather than a view to making a career in music.

‘I know that working in the music industry full time is very difficult and demanding. I see my singing as something I enjoy as a hobby.’

Beth along with thousands of others donated their voice to be used in the commercial by downloading their singing to a special website set up by the supermarket.

She added: ‘It seemed to me to be a good way of contributing to a good cause and it didn’t involve running a marathon.

The Waitrose Christmas advert is due to air during the commercial break of X Factor this Sunday evening

Waitrose appears to have switched from using celebrities to front its Christmas advert for this year 

I assumed I would be just one of the voices among the crowd. It never occurred to me that my voice would be picked out.’

The full 90 second ad will air at 8.15pm on Sunday in the X Factor break with a 10 second introduction from the poet Roger McGough to thank the public for donating their singing for charity.

It will be repeated at 9.15pm during Downton Abbey, and again at at 9.30pm during Homeland on Channel 4.

The song will go on sale via download immediately through iTunes and Google Play with all profits going to the three charities.

Dolly Parton, who gave a stand-out performance at this year’s Glastonbury Festival, released ‘Try’ in the summer and she has used it as the theme for her own campaigning work on improving literacy.

The song does not have a Christmas theme, however the lyrics talk about striving to overcome difficulties in life.

Describing the song, she said: ‘It's about saying you've just gotta get out there and try. 

It's an uplifting encouraging song. You're not going to amount to anything unless you try.’

Rupert Thomas, Waitrose Marketing Director, said: ‘Because our Partners own the business, they are motivated to go that little bit further for customers - and that’s what we want to portray in this advert.

‘The extra dimension of the soundtrack means customers can also give something back. When they donated their voice, they also had a chance to support three worthy charities who will be receiving the profits from the song when it goes on sale as the ad airs.’
