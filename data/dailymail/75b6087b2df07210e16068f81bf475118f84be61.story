A Chinese businessman was so angry about a filthy river in his hometown that he made an equally dirty offer: daring a local official £21,000 to swim in it.

Jin Zengmin posted photos of the garbage-filled river on his blog, making the offer to local environmental protection chief Bao Zhenming.

It comes as China's environment ministry admitted the country is home to 'cancer villages' - clusters of hundreds of people who have developed the fatal disease.

Accused: Local media has accused companies of pumping toxic waste into the groundwater supply

Dirty: Green duckweed floats on the surface of Hanjiang River, running through the city of Wuhan

Mr Zengmin had grown frustrated about pollution in Rui'an city in China's eastern province of Zhejian

He said on his microblog that a 
rubber shoe factory has been dumping waste water into the river and that
the area had an exceptionally high cancer rate.

The challenge, made on Saturday, reflects a growing frustration among the Chinese public over widespread pollution and lack of governmental action.

It quickly inspired at least one other offer, with another post appearing on Tuesday on an online forum offering a 300,000 yuan (£32,000) cash prize to the environmental protection chief in the nearby county of Cangnan if the official swam in polluted rivers there.

A Rui'an government spokesman would not say whether Mr Zhenming would accept the challenge.

But he said the bureau had contacted Mr Zengmin and will take some measures, including working with residents to clean up trash in the river and putting up signs warning against dumping.

He also said that the public should shoulder responsibility in protecting the environment and that the environmental protection bureau welcomes public supervision and participation in cleaning up local rivers.

China's booming economy has caused serious water pollution, with a number of high-profile industrial accidents along major rivers.

Hu Siyi, vice minister of water resources, said that 20 per cent of China's rivers were so polluted that their water quality was rated too toxic for human contact and that up to 40 per cent of the rivers were seriously polluted.

Last month, around nine tons of aniline, a chemical used to make polyurethane, leaked into a river in northern China.

The leak wasn't reported for five days, and by then it had contaminated the water supply of a city in a neighboring province.

The government made it startling 'cancer villages' admission in its five-year plan for tackling air pollution.

The document reads: 'In recent years, toxic and hazardous chemical pollution has caused many environmental disasters, cutting off drinking water supplies, and even leading to severe health and social problems such as 'cancer villages'.

Campaigners have long called for the authorities to recognise the problem of contaminated soil, water and air, and to support those affected.

Ma Jun, one of the countries leading environmentalists, told The Telegraph: 'I do think this shows a positive development. The recognition of the existence of problems is the very first step and the precondition for us to really start solving these problems.

'Before there was always this tendency to play down or even cover up the issues. If that continues then all these problems with air, water, soil and groundwater pollution and their health impact could drag on for a long, long time.'

The plan outlines a crackdown on the use and production of nearly 60 toxic chemicals and warns the country faces a grave situation in terms of pollution controls and policies to regulate the use of such substances.

Cancer is already China's biggest killer, with one in four residents dieing from the disease following an 80 per cent rise in the mortality rate from cancer over the past 30 years. But experts warns lung cancer rates in particular are only going to get worse because of the air pollution.

The capital Beijing and other large cities have had to cope with numerous onsets of toxic smog already this year, which has made the authorities look at the issue.

But allegations in the local media that factories have been pumping toxic waste into the groundwater supply has forced this issue onto the public agenda as well.

Mr Deng, who has encouraged people to post pictures of such pollution online, added: 'If things continue like this, we will all be doomed. If the issue is not properly solved, not only will it kill people but it will also drag down the entire healthcare system because of the number of cancer patients it causes.'

Ma Jun, from the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs said more research is needed to establish a clearer link between 'cancer villages' and pollution, and said China should introduced precautionary measures similar to those used by the United States and Japan.

He added the government is much more willing to be open about the issue than it has been in the past, and said it signals a shift towards greater transparency by the country's secretive authorities.
