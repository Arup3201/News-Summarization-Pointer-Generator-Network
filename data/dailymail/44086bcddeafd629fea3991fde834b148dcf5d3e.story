The head of Energy UK has claimed the Big Six energy firms do not make large profits – despite the £3.7billion they raked in last year.

Angela Knight, chief executive of the body that represents the energy giants, made the claim as details emerged of the widespread tax avoidance employed legally by energy firms.

It was also revealed that companies are making an estimated £36million a year in interest on the credit built up by customers paying via direct debit.

Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, has said power companies' profits are not that large, as details of legal tax avoidance start to emerge

Politicians including former prime  minister Sir John Major and Labour leader Ed Miliband are clamouring to rein in the energy firms.

But Miss Knight, a former Tory MP, said: ‘They might be politically popular, but price freezes have never worked and never will work,’ she said.

‘Windfall taxes have taken place in the past where there have been windfall profits. The profits here of four or five pence in the pound aren’t particularly big.’

But her claims were immediately  dismissed by Caroline Flint, Labour’s energy spokesman, who said: ‘Last year the Big Six energy companies made over £3.7billion in profits, so the idea that these companies aren’t making any money is completely and utterly ridiculous.

'The public know they’re being ripped off and they’re not going to be fooled by lobbyists working for the energy giants.’

While the Big Six – British Gas, SSE, nPower, E.On, EDF and Scottish Power – make profits of around 4 or 5 per cent from supplying energy to households and businesses, they make an average of 22 per cent from generating electricity, sourcing and storing gas, and transporting energy.

Big firms are also believed to be stockpiling as much as £2billion in credit from those who pre-pay via direct debit.

While firms make around 5 or 6 per cent profit supplying energy into homes, they make nearer 22 per cent for generating power

Energy Minister Greg Barker promised to ‘come down like a ton of bricks’ on energy providers accumulating cash from householders’ direct debits.

A whistleblower at British Gas told The Observer that the energy giant boosts its own profits by using  millions of pounds of credit built up by former customers.

The provider has taken £20million from customers with outstanding credit over the past year.

Despite huge profits, firms can legally reduce tax bills by exploiting loopholes that  allow their owners to lend them money via the Channel Islands Stock Exchange.

It emerged that Scotia Gas, UK Power Networks and Electricity Northwest avoided paying a total of £140million in tax by racking up interest on debt to their owners.

The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said on yesterday’s Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 that he was ‘livid’ about tax avoidance, adding: ‘Everybody needs to pay their fair share.’

More than three million older people are worried about staying warm indoors this winter – with six million anxious about rising fuel bills, says Age UK.

But the charity said many are unaware of the potentially fatal consequences of living in poorly heated housing.
