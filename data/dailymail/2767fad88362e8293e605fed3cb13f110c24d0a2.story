They say the women of New York are matched only by Parisian ladies when it comes to fashion and grooming.

And it seems Princess Eugenie has upped the style stakes since moving to the Big Apple a few months ago.

The 23-year-old royal was seen looking the picture of elegance as she joined a host of celebrities at  the Dolce & Gabbana 19th Annual Artwalk last night.

Princess Eugenie looked like her new life in New York was suiting her as she arrived at the event last night

The city's 'cool' has obviously rubbed off on the young royal, who looked chic in black

Wearing a tailored black knee-length coat to protect her from the autumnal chill, Eugenie looked happy and confident as she strolled out of the party.

The princess teamed the coat with Rag & Bone ankle boots and black tights, a soft black scarf, and rather edgy black bowler hat.

She kept her shoulder-length auburn hair loose under the hat and carried a dark brown leather satchel bag over one shoulder.

As is Eugenie's style, her make-up was simple, with just a touch of eyeliner and mascara to bring out her eyes.

The event was attended by a wealth of New York high society including Alec and Hilaria Baldwin, Jennifer Connelly, Coco Rocha and Fabiola Beracasa, contributing editor of Elle magazine.

The Artwalk, held at 82 Mercer Street, aims to raise money for the city’s homeless, involved live and silent auctions, cocktails and tastings from some of New York’s best restaurants.

Having only moved to New York last month, the princess seems to have settled in well and has been visited by both her mother the Duchess of York and her father Prince Andrew since her arrival.

Eugenie moved to America to being her new job at Paddle8, an online auction house which specialises in upmarket art and collectibles.

She is regularly seen out and about with Paddle8 owners - and old Etonian friend of her cousin Prince William - Alexander Gilkes, 34, and director Thomas Galbraith.
