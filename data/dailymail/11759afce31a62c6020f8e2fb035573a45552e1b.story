The ex-boyfriend of one-time Oakland Raiders star Fred Biletnikoff’s 20-year-old daughter has been sentenced to 55 years-to life in prison after strangling her in a ‘drug-crazed fury’.

Former convicted kidnapper Mohammed Haroon Ali was found guilty of first-degree murder after savagely attacking Tracey Biletnikoff and strangling her using his hands and a t-shirt at a drugs treatment centre in California.

The 37-year-old was on probation for the kidnapping and threatening to kill a former fiancé when he met Ms Biletnikoff in 1997.

They were both recovering from drug addictions and were involved in counseling younger addicts at Project Ninety, a treatment programme in San Mateo.

Ali relapsed, District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said, and Ms Biletnikoff confronted him about it on February 15.

In what his attorney described as a ‘drug-crazed fury’ Ali killed his girlfriend, then dumped her body hear Canada College in Redwood City and fled to Mexico.

Authorities caught up with him as he crossed back over the border, driving the dead woman’s car. 

Ali claimed Ms Biletnikoff’s death was an accident, testifying that he pulled off her pants to make it look like a sex crime.

He repeatedly apologised during the San Mateo County Superior Court trial, ahead of his sentencing on Thursday.

As it was read out Ms Biletnikoff’s 
father, NFL Hall of Famer Fred Biletnikoff, called Ali an ‘animal’ and 
said his hatred for him would never go away, the San Mateo County Times reported.  

‘There will never be any closure for me,’ he said. 

Her
mother, Jennifer Webster, read a list of this she will never be able to
do with her daughter, including planning the girl's wedding or holding her 
grandchildren. 

‘The pain never goes away,’ she said. ‘You took away all that she was and all that she would have been.’

Brutal: Tracey Biletnikoff was just 20-years-old when she was strangled by her then-boyfriend using a t-shirt and his hands

A Facebook page called 'Peace for Tracey
Biletnikoff' was set up by the family to raise awareness of the horrific crime, as they fought to bring their 
daughter's killer to justice.

It is the second time that Ali has been found guilty of the murder, after a 2001 conviction was thrown in 2009.

A federal appeals court ruled that the prosecutor had removed at least one black juror for racial reasons and Ali was held in custody to await another trial.

The judge rejected a plea for a lower jail term from the defence because of Ali’s prior conviction, doubling his sentence under the state’s Three Strikes Law.
