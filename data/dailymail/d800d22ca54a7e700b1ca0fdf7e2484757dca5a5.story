A Republican state representative has sparked outrage by suggesting rape kits can be used to terminate pregnancies.

Jodie Laubenberg, a member of the Texas House of Representatives, made the comments during a debate about a new anti-abortion bill.

Miss Laubenberg said: 'In the emergency room they have whatâ€™s called rape kits, where a woman can get cleaned out.

'The woman had five months to make that decision, at this point we are looking at a baby that is very far along in its development.'

Her apparent confusion about 'rape kits' - the equipment used by medical personnel during forensic examinations to gather physical evidence following allegations of rape or sexual assault - sparked widespread ridicule on social media sites.

The bill, which was passed by the House on Monday, would ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, require doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and limit abortions to surgical centers.

Miss Laubenberg, the bill's sponsor, made the comments in response to a proposal by another Republican member for an exemption for women who were victims of rape and incest.

Hundreds of protesters have crowded into the state capitol building over the past few days to oppose the bill

The bill is due to be heard by the state Senate today. Hundreds of protesters have crowded into the state capitol building over the past few days to oppose the measure.

According to the National Council of State Legislatures, eight state legislatures have banned abortions after 20 weeks.

Arizona did so at 18 weeks and Arkansas passed a ban after 12 weeks. Federal judges have thrown out the laws in Arizona and Iowa, and judges have blocked similar measures in the other states.
