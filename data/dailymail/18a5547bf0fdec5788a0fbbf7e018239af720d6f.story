Murderer Craig Hudson won taxpayer funding for a High Court case in which he demanded the right to wear a woman's wig in prison

A murderer won taxpayer funding for a High Court case in which he demanded the right to wear a woman’s wig in jail.

Craig Hudson – who is serving a life sentence for torturing and killing his wife – said he wanted to change sex and protested that without a female wig he would look like a ‘bald drag artiste’.

The claim, paid for through legal aid, will result in a prison service review of the right of transgender prisoners to wear wigs and outsize women’s clothes.

In a ruling revealed yesterday, Judge Jeremy Richardson QC accepted the argument of governors at maximum security Frankland prison, Durham, who told the court wigs are banned because prisoners can use them as a disguise in escape attempts.

But the judge told prison officials: ‘Further work, I feel, needs to be done to see if the security risks may be mitigated.’

The judicial review brought by Hudson is understood to have cost taxpayers up to £10,000 in payments to a specialist firm of prison solicitors and a barrister.

Taxpayers also funded a barrister and other lawyers to represent the Ministry of Justice, and the expense of running the court, resulting in total costs of up to £30,000.

The case provoked a row at the Ministry of Justice, which runs the Legal Aid Agency, as Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is trying to cut legal aid waste and limit the number of spurious judicial review cases.

Hudson’s claim went to the High Court despite concerns among medical experts and prison staff over his commitment to a sex change.

The court heard that in prison he does not wear make-up or women’s clothing, even though he has the right to do so.

But he is now known officially as Kimberley Green and accused prison authorities of unlawful discrimination on transgender grounds. Hudson, 29, was a member of a ‘family from hell’ in Nottingham who imprisoned and tortured his 20-year-old wife, Rachel. Mrs Hudson died after two years of daily beatings and abuse. Her body was wrapped in a carpet and dumped. 

Her husband was one of five family members convicted of murder in December 2005. He was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 14 years, with concurrent sentences for attempts to pervert the course of justice. The High Court judge noted that the judge at Hudson’s murder trial said he ‘displayed a clear tendency to lie’.

In the latest ruling, Judge Richardson said Hudson was a prisoner ‘for whom the very highest regime of security is not needed, but for whom escape must be made very difficult’.

‘It is unclear whether the claimant has a diagnosis of [gender] dysphoria … A consultant psychiatrist at Charing Cross hospital regarded the claimant as a conundrum who appeared to be saying different things to different people,’ the judge said.

Hudson complained that he was not given hormone treatment, prosthetic devices, hair removal products, separate gym changing and drug testing facilities, or access to wigs.

But the judge ruled in the prison’s favour, saying: ‘To provide a wig in the prison context is simply providing a hostage to fortune – a plain security risk.’

But he added: ‘There may come a time in the future where the wig issue and the outsize clothing issue will not be so easily rebutted.’

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said legal aid ‘must be targeted at those most in need of a lawyer’ and that it is stopping prisoners receiving criminal legal aid unnecessarily.

The Legal Aid Agency said cases had to meet ‘strict financial means and legal merits tests’.
