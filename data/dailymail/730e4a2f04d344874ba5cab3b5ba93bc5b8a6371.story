Channing Tatum wants to star in a new Ghostbusters franchise, according to the latest hacked emails from Sony Pictures.

In the emails, which were leaked in a November 24 cyber-attack on the studio, Tatum told Sony co-chairman, Amy Pascal, that he should star in a reboot of the 1984 classic - and that it could have the same audience appeal of Christopher Nolan's Batman franchise.

In an August email, the Magic Mike star, expressed abundant enthusiasm for the remake which would also star Chris Pratt.

The original: Channing Tatum told bosses at Sony he wanted a lead role in a remake of Ghostbusters, originally made in 1984 starring (from left) Harold Ramis, Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd 

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Tatum's message read: 'Let us show the world The DarkSide and let us fight it with all the glory and epicness of a HUGE BATMAN BEGINS MOVIE. 

'I know we can make this a huge franchise. Fun adventure craziness. COME OONNNN!!!'

A follow-up email from Columbia Pictures co-president of production Hannah Minghella, added that directors Anthony and Joe Russo, who worked on The Avengers and Captain America, wanted to get involved. 

Minghella allegedly wrote: 'The Russos, Channing and [Tatum's producing partner] Reid [Carolin] have been brainstorming ideas and want to create a whole new mythology that would support multiple movies (the way that [Christopher] Nolan reinvented Batman).'  

According to THR, the Russos wanted Paul Feig, who is directing a Ghostbusters movie with women in the leading roles, to also direct their Tatum and Pratt version. 

According to reports, Sony execs were excited about the concept - including Pascal, who responded: 'F***.'

News of an all-female Ghostbusters cast was also leaked during the security breach - and director Feig planned to make it 'scarier and more hi-tech' than the Eighties version, starring Harold Ramis, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Sigourney Weaver.

The director reportedly hoped that Games Of Throne star Peter Dinklage would play the villain 'who returns as a ghost after his execution'. 

In the original movie, the ghost of dead librarian terrifies the ghost-busting crew after she transforms into a gruesome monster. 

Cecily Strong, SNL cast member, was also being lined up for an 'antagonistic' starring role. 

Pascal's excitement for the alleged Ghostbusters project wasn't mirrored in her reaction in another email about director Cameron Crowe's rom-com starring Bradley Cooper. 

The untitled movie stars Cooper as a military contractor who falls in love with an Air Force officer played by Emma Stone.

Rachel McAdams, Alec Baldwin, Bill Murray, John Krasinski and Danny McBride have all signed on to play supporting characters, according to Gawker. 

Pascal wrote: 'I'm never starting a movie again when the script is ridiculous. I don't care how much I love the director and the actors. It never, not even once, ever works.

She also criticized director Crowe for not changing the script after test audiences responded negatively: 'People don't like people in movies who flirt with married people or married people who flirt.' 

On November 24, Sony Pictures Entertainment computers were hacked.

According to reports, hackers attacked the company relating to the release of The Interview, a movie starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, where a celebrity journalist lands an interview with North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-Il, and becomes part of a plan to assassinate him.

Other highly sensitive material from the Sony hacking is being leaked almost daily, including exchanges between Oscar-winning producer Scott Rudin and Sony co-chairman Amy Pascal that contained a frank assessment of Angelina Jolie's talent and racially offensive jokes about Obama's presumed taste in movies.
