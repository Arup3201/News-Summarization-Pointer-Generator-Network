Manchester United splashed the cash during the summer in an attempt to fire themselves back into Premier League contention after their seventh-placed finish last season.

New manager Louis van Gaal spent £150m to overhaul the squad at Old Trafford, bringing in the likes of Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria among others.

With no fewer than six new arrivals to bed in ahead of this weekend's game against QPR, we asked our team of experts what they think Van Gaal's strongest team is (assuming everyone is fit.)   

                               De Gea

           Rafael     Jones     Rojo     Shaw

               Di Maria    Carrick    Blind

           Van Persie    Falcao     Rooney 

MATT BARLOW 

Four at the back offers a more solid base for all the attacking forces. Carrick in to sit and control. Legs from Blind and Di Maria. And what a front three. 

Sadly no room for Mata, a wonderful player, but he can be involved behind two strikers with a slight tweak to 4-3-1-2.

LEE CLAYTON 

Still not sure about the key full-back areas and Rafael is a mistake waiting to happen every game. 

Carrick, playing very deep and dropping to make an auxiliary centre back/front sweeper is key to this. 

Mata slows down the game too much.

The front three could be explosive, if they can fit together.

MATT LAWTON 

I think there are weaknesses in this side, not least at the back. 

I’ve gone for Smalling at right back because I simply don’t trust Rafael.

But the forward line, with Rooney playing a number 10 role, is packed with pace and ability. This is a team that should score more goals than it concedes.

In and out: Juan Mata has struggled to cement a place in the team since his big-money move from Chelsea

                          Herrera     Blind

               Rooney      Mata      Di Maria

                                Falcao 

CHRIS WHEELER

Even though it’s an attacking line-up, there’s no room for Van Persie. On current form, he would be used off the bench.

The system depends on two things: the front three of Rooney, Mata and Di Maria being inter-changeable, and Valencia and Shaw being more defensively responsible.

Otherwise, I wouldn’t fancy facing this lot.

Competition: Robin van Persie's first-team place is under threat after the arrival of Falcao

                               De Gea

            Smalling      Evans      Rojo

     Rafael    Blind   Herrera  Di Maria  Januzaj

                     Rooney       Falcao 

DOMINIC KING 

Try and play around with the names United have available and you will see that for all razzmatazz up front, the defence wouldn't fill you with great confidence.

They might score goals but they are going to concede a few along the way until Van Gaal's methods begin to work.

They couldn't slip up against QPR with those options, could they?

                               Carrick

                   Di Maria            Blind

                                Mata 

                    Falcao      Van Persie 

JOE BERNSTEIN 

Take a leaf out of England's book and play with a diamond to get the best out of attacking players. 

The problem is Rooney, arguably United's best all-round player but master of none. 

Is he specifically a better creative number 10 than Mata? 

But he would be first reserve if anyone is tired, injured or suspended.

Fitting in: Ander Herrera was one of United's first signings in the transfer window from Athletic Bilbao

                               De Gea

           Rafael     Jones     Evans     Rojo

                        Fletcher      Blind

             Januzaj     Rooney     Di Maria

                               Falcao 

ROB DRAPER 

Ditch the back three - Van Gaal has played with four for much of his career so there's no need to continue with a vanity project. 

Luke Shaw will have to take a back seat for now and van Persie and Mata will have to learn how to be super subs. 

Just get the right shape and the best 11 on the pitch and worry about reputations later. 

Ideally Carrick would play in holding midfield when back from injury.

                              Rooney

                 Van Persie      Falcao 

MARTHA KELNER 

This system best accommodates the almost embarrassment of riches Manchester United have in attack.

Rooney reverting to the No 10 role allows for Falcao's inclusion and could suit him better as he ages and loses the electrifying burst of pace he once had. 

Four at back is stronger. Mata is the one to miss out.

Moving on: Striker Danny Welbeck was sold to Arsenal for £16million on transfer deadline day

                              De Gea

           Rafael     Jones     Rojo     Shaw

                               Blind

              Rooney     Mata     Januzaj

                  Van Persie      Falcao 

SAM CUNNINGHAM 

With that many forward options, Manchester United need to revert to Liverpool's hyper-attacking formation of last season to get the most out of them.

Even then, there is still no place in my side for new-boy Di Maria. Mata gets the nod for me, to give him a chance to return to the devastating form he produced in the No 10 role for Chelsea.

Herrera is also sacrificed in that formation, with Blind's defensive ability required over Herrera's diverse passing range.

It also opens up a space for Januzaj on the left wing. He is one of the brightest young talents in world football, so it is astounding he's not first choice already. Rooney is forced into the right of the three attacking midfielders behind the strikers, but I feel his future lies further back.

           Rafael     Jones     Rojo     Shaw

                               Blind

           Di Maria     Rooney     Herrera

                 Falcao      Van Persie 

LAURIE WHITWELL 

This system is a defensive risk but Blind performs the screening role ahead of the back four excellently, and would allow the likes of Di Maria and Herrera scope to get forward to do damage. 

Those two up front would scare the daylights out of any centre-backs and Rooney can pull the strings. 

Shaw needs to get fit and Rafael produce consistency but they are full-backs of quality. Rojo sneaks in ahead of Evans after his MK Dons horror show.

Condition: Luke Shaw has been hampered by fitness and injury problems since moving from Southampton

                             De Gea

          Rafael     Jones     Rojo     Shaw

       Januzaj     Carrick     Blind     Di Maria

                  Van Persie      Falcao 

CRAIG HOPE 

Forget three at the back, it’s had its summer of love, it would be a winter of depression if Van Gaal persisted with it. And forget  Rooney, he’s become a problem for club and country, an angry man who knows his powers are – pardon the pun – on the wane.

The back four picks itself but the two who miss out in midfield are Herrera and  Mata. Herrera looks a class act, admittedly, but  Carrick will be more like the player of two seasons ago with the likes of Di Maria and Falcao to feed off his cunning creativity. 

Blind provides a little bit more know-how in the middle of the park and that allows Januzaj and Di Maria to terrorise down the flanks. Van Persie and Falcao could be devastating as a pair, don’t complicate it by trying to accommodate Rooney. Carrick gets the armband.

                              Carrick 

            Di Maria     Rooney     Blind 

                  Van Persie      Falcao 

NICK HARRIS 

This emphasises Van Gaal’s riches from midfield up and dearth of options in defence. 

You’d ideally want a better right-back and another better, more consistent centre-half, at least one.

 As it is, a shield is crucial, Carrick in this case with the huge proviso he's at his peak. Rooney would have license to roam in the central role of the three. Other choices there abound - Fletcher, Mata and Herrera foremost among them.

Plenty to ponder: Louis van Gaal is without a win in his first four games as Manchester United manager

                                De Gea

         Valencia     Jones     Rojo    Shaw

                 Herrera    Blind    Di Maria

                                Rooney 

                    Van Persie      Falcao 

CHARLIE SKILLEN 

Van Gaal will have to make the best out of a poor selection of defenders.

He can keep the marauding full-backs of Valencia and Shaw, but Jones and  Rojo will have to form a decent partnership – quickly.

The signing of Blind should add a bite to midfield previously lacking, while he can also drop into a back three if the full-backs are bombing on.

Attacking-wise is clearly a different story - Di Maria can add creativity from a midfield position while Rooney will also drop deep, leaving Van Persie and Falcao as the deadliest duo in the league. Juan Mata will be the odd man out and see his second consecutive January transfer.

Lagging behind: United have just two points from their first three Premier League games

                              De Gea

                Jones     Carrick     Rojo

    Rafael                                        Shaw

                     Herrera     Blind 

                             Di Maria

                      Rooney     Falcao 

JOE RIDGE 

There is no room for Mata in the side, no matter how you look at it.

It's also near impossible to see how Rooney, Van Persie and Falcao can all play together. 

Given that Rooney got the nod to captain United over Van Gaal, one has to assume Van Persie is now third choice. 

With Jones and Rojo doing the dirty work either side of him, Carrick could be developed into a sweeper and linchpin of Van Gaal's 3-5-2.
