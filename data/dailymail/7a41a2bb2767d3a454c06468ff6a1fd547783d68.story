It was the craze that saw customers sleep outside a New York bakery to be first in line outside the shop this summer.

Skirmishes broke out when those who had been queuing were unable to get their hands on dwindling supplies of precious cronuts, the flaky, fried treat that is half-doughnut, half-croissant..

Britain has since embraced the cronut madness and seen the birth of the Greggsnut - Gregg's own limited edition version of the doughnut-croissant hybrid, which was such as success it is to be rolled out nationwide.

Now, Waitrose has hopped on the doughnut-blend bandwagon and come up with its own flaky, fried treat: the yumdough, a yum yum-doughnut hybrid.

Yumdoughs are topped with sugar icing with pockets of filling and fondant and comes in four flavours

Made from 144-layer dough, the treat is light and airy with a textured effect. 

It is topped 
with sugar icing with pockets of filling and fondant, and comes in four flavours: chocolate and orange; lemon; butterscotch and raspberry and vanilla.

Arriving today, the yumdough will be sold in 40 Waitrose branches for £1.49. There is an introductory offer of 25 per cent off.

The original Cronut was a croissant-doughnut pastry attributed to chef Dominique Ansel of the  Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York City. The recipe took two months and ten recipes to perfect. In May 2013, the bakery trademarked the name

It took America by storm and spawned a bakery black market as demand outstripped supply. To the delight of everyone on this side of the Atlantic, British bakers soon came up with their own take on the treat.

The Greggsnut, which comes in two flavours, berry or caramel-pecan, is made using a similar method - layers of pastry formed into a doughnut shape, fried, iced, and filled with either berry cream or caramel.

And hot on their heels, the ring-shaped yumdough: a mixture of the yum yum (a flakier take on the doughnut, where the pastry is traditionally plaited) and the doughnut.

'Our customers will love this delicious combination of two of their favourite sweet treats on the bakery counter,' says Tim Stevens, bakery buyer at Waitrose.

'Our customers love to try something new and we think they'll find the yumdough lip-smackingly good.'

The cronut, which has already received 
interest from curious pastry chefs in Hong Kong, Melbourne, and Los 
Angeles, is made from thin layers of flaky croissant dough that are deep
fried, rolled in rose sugar, and then filled with light Tahitian 
vanilla cream.

Rose-flavored glaze thinly coats the top layer, 
which peels apart; finally, 
crystallized rose petals add a garnish flourish.

'A cronut is not
as simple as frying up some croissant dough,' said the chef. 'We 
actually make a special laminated dough that is sheeted and folded 
different than a croissant'.

Man behind the invention: 'I'm a big fan of 
quality over quantity... It takes a lot to ensure all our other pastries
are up to par with standards as well,' said Mr Ansel
