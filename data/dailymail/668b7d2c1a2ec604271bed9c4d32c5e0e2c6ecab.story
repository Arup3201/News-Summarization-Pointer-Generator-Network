The businessman who forced Liam Fox to resign from the Cabinet by revealing he was travelling the world with a bogus 'adviser' is the secret paymaster behind a campaign to oust him as an MP.

In 2011, it was revealed Dr Fox, the then Defence Secretary, had taken close friend Adam Werritty with him on 18 overseas trips as part of his official party, funded by private donors and business interests, and given him frequent access to the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

Dubai-based Harvey Boulter was first to disclose Dr Fox and Mr Werritty's unorthodox relationship and now The Mail on Sunday has learnt he has donated £30,000 to Ukip candidate Ian Kealey – Dr Fox's main opponent in his North Somerset constituency.

Mr Boulter's intervention may prove decisive. North Somerset is high on Ukip's list of target seats, and it came top there in last year's European Parliament elections

As well as the donation, Mr Boulter is paying for a billboard poster to be displayed in the area. It shows Dr Fox and Mr Werritty together at the former's wedding accompanied by the slogan 'Vote Him, Get Him'

Dr Fox's relationship with Mr Werritty erupted into controversy when it emerged the MP had allowed his friend to create the 'misleading impression' he had an official Government position. It was also revealed Mr Werritty had been Dr Fox's best man at his 2005 wedding.

An inquiry by Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell found Dr Fox had breached the Ministerial Code.

As well as the donation, a UK company Mr Boulter controls is paying for a billboard poster to be displayed in the area. It shows the MP and Mr Werritty together at Dr Fox's wedding accompanied by the slogan 'Vote Him, Get Him'.

Mr Boulter's intervention may prove decisive. North Somerset is high on Ukip's list of target seats, and it came top there in last year's European Parliament elections.

Mr Kealey, 56, a nuclear physicist-turned-farmer, said yesterday: 'Harvey's generous donation is making quite a big difference, enabling us to get the Ukip message across with a series of newsletters and other campaign activities.'

Following the scandal, Dr Fox, 56, resigned, apologising for 'errors of judgment' and mixing up his professional and personal loyalties

Mr Boulter said he believed North Somerset 'deserved better' than Dr Fox. He added: 'I believe it is true that Ukip is best positioned to unseat him.'

If that happens it will be sweet revenge for Mr Boulter. Although his main revelations were unchallenged, Dr Fox sued him for libel over comments he made in an unbroadcast portion of a TV interview published online. Last year he settled and paid damages.

Mr Werritty, 36, lived rent-free in Dr Fox's flat. He had no security clearance, but attended meetings inside the MoD on numerous occasions, and carried a business card which falsely claimed he was an official 'advisor'. 

The scandal began when he presented this to Mr Boulter at a meeting in Dubai to discuss a business deal with the MoD.

Following the scandal, Dr Fox, 56, resigned, apologising for 'errors of judgment' and mixing up his professional and personal loyalties.

Last night he said: 'I look forward to fighting the election on the issues that affect my constituents in North Somerset.'
