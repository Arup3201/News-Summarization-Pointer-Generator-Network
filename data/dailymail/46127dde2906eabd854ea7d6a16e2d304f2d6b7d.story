Crystal Palace and Sunderland are among the clubs monitoring Senegal international midfielder Stephane Badji.

The 24-year-old impressed scouts during his country’s 1-0 victory over Egypt in Cairo on Saturday and is keen on a move to England.

The 6ft 3ins versatile midfielder was part of Senegal’s Olympic squad in 2012 and plays for Brann in Norway but is understood to have a £600,000 release clause in his contract which has alerted Premier League clubs looking for a bargain.
