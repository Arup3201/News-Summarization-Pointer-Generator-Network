This is the moment an owl escaped from the front grille of a truck - and flew away unharmed.

The bird had a lucky escape after it flew into the path of a truck driven by Michelle Mullins in Cherryville, North Carolina, late on Tuesday night.

Ms Mullins was driving home from the town's high school with her daughter Allison, where they had been decorating for Allison's 16th birthday the next day, reports WBTV.

They spotted the owl at the side of the road where it immediately took flight and became trapped in the grille.

Ms Mullins pulled over at a gas station and called police, while onlookers gathered to see if the owl could be freed.Â 

Thankfully, a Cherryville police 
officer opened the hood, took part of the grille away, and gave the owl 
room to spread its wings and fly.

But it wasn't a smooth getaway. The 
bird bumped straight into the gas station window and huddled in a corner
while concerned onlookers could be heard asking if it were ok.

They got their answer quickly. Looking unruffled, the owl took off into the night.

During its escapade, the clock turned midnight - and Allison's birthday became more of a tweet sixteen than sweet sixteen.

'She'll never forget her 16th birthday, ever,' Ms Mullins told WBTV.

'It's just unbelievable, that's why we videoed it because nobody's ever going to believe there's an owl in my truck.'
