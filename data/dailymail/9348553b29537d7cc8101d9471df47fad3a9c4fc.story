An Ohio woman discovered that her biological mother worked at the same company as her and lived only six minutes away.

The Ohio Department of Heath released birth records for people born between January 1, 1964, and September 18, 1996, last month, allowing people their first access to the information.

After receiving her records in the mail, La-Sonya Mitchell-Clark, 38, of Youngstown, finally got the answers she's wanted almost her whole life.

She looked up her mother's name, Francine Simmons, on Facebook and found out she worked Infocision - the same call-center operation company she works at.

'Ever since I found out that I was adopted I wanted to know who my biological mother was,' Mitchell-Clark told WYTV.

And after connecting the dots, she realized her mother was closer than she could imagine. 

'There's a Francine that works at my job,' she said after finding the woman on Facebook. 'She works in VR and she works at the front desk.'  

She reached out to friends on social media who knew Simmons and the next day she got a phone call from her birth mother. 

'She called me and I said, "Is this Ms. Francine?" She said, yes. I said, "I think I'm your daughter",' Mitchell-Clark said about the first time the women spoke. 

And, as it turns out, the mother and daughter live just six minutes away from one another in Youngstown. 

Simmons said she was 'still in shock' from finding out about her daughter, who she always wanted to contact but never knew how.

Mitchell-Clark also found out that she had three biological younger sisters. Two of the sisters, Kamala (left) and Maisha (right) Cummings, said that the reunion was 'a relief' and 'amazing' for their family

'I got pregnant when I was 14. I had her when I was 15. I was put in a home, a girl's home. Had her. Got to hold her. Didn't get to name her, but I named her myself in my heart all these years,' Simmons told WYTV. 

Mitchell-Clark also found out that she has three younger sisters she didn't know about.  

Simmons's daughter Kamala Cummings said that meeting Mitchell-Clark has been 'a sense of relief' for  her family, particularly for her mother.

'It's just amazing that all this time we're thinking about her and trying to find her and she was trying to find us, too,'  Maisha Cummings, another daughter of Simmons, told WYTV.

Mitchell-Clark said that her adoptive parents have been very supportive of her search for her biological parents. 

'(They've) always encouraged me to look for them. They're going to be a part of this, too,' she said.
