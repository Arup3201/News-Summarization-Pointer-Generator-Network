The submarine car driven by James Bond in The Spy Who Loved Me has been sold at auction for £550,000.

The Lotus Esprit was the subject of a fierce battle between a female buyer and a telephone bidder, who eventually came out the winner at RM Auctions in Battersea, South-West London.

The distinctive-looking vehicle was designed for an underwater scene in the 1977 spy film, which starred Roger Moore as 007.

Those in the auction room - including Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans, a motoring columnist for the Mail on Sunday - clapped as bids went up to £550,000, which after charges left the buyer £616,000 out of pocket.

Peter Haynes, from RM Auctions, said the auctioneer was pleased with the price despite it coming in at under estimated prices of between £650,000 and £950,000.

'We are very happy with that price, it is very strong money for what is an important piece of movie memorabilia,' Mr Haynes said.

'Bearing in mind it is not a car that can be driven on the road, the price just goes to prove the draw that all Bond-related memorabilia has.'

The car cannot be driven on the road, although it is said to be a fully operational submarine.

Film: The Spy Who Loved Me starred Roger Moore as James Bond

The previous owner, who has chosen to stay anonymous, found the car after buying a storage container in Long Island in 1989.

It is believed the Lotus was left in storage by the production company which paid for the container for 10 years. But when the payment ran out and nobody came to collect it, it was put up for sale.

The man who bought it earns a 'very modest' living through his business which rents out construction tools.

He did not recognise the car for what it was as he had reportedly never seen a Bond film at the time.

When he pulled the covers off the car and found it had no wheels and a dented roof, he was less than thrilled with his buy.

But as he drove the car home on the 
back of a truck, other drivers who recognised the vehicle radioed him to
tell him what it was.

Back home he rented The Spy Who Loved Me on video, and realised how valuable his find was. 

The
Lotus was nicknamed 'Wet Nellie' during filming and was built by a 
former Navy SEAL at a cost of around $100,000 - the equivalent to 
$500,000 today.

Although
Roger Moore starred as Bond in the film, the submarine car was driven 
by retired Navy SEAL Don Griffin during underwater filming.

There were actually several different 
Lotus Esprits used to film the sequence where Roger Moore and Barbara 
Bach escape the enemy by driving off a pier into the sea.

The car up for sale is the only one that worked as a self-propelled submarine.

Since its discovery the car has been exhibited from time to time but largely kept with its private owner.

James Bond expert Doug Redenius tracked down its owner and confirmed the Lotus's authenticity.

The 1964 Aston Martin DB5 driven by Sean Connery in Goldfinger and Thunderball was previously sold by RM Auctions for $4.4million in 2010.
