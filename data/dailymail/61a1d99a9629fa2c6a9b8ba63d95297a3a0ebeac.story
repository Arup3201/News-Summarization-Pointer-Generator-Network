Queens Park Rangers defender Steven Caulker is hoping the next manager to take the Loftus Road hot-seat can rejuvenate the relegation threatened side.

Harry Redknapp quit the west London club yesterday, citing replacement knee surgery as the reason for his exit.

Former Tottenham Hotspur duo Tim Sherwood and Glenn Hoddle are reportedly on the shortlist of replacements for Redknapp.

As is Derby County manager Steve McClaren and Real Madrid assistant coach Paul Clement, who has also had spells working with French giants PSG.

Caulker, who joined the Hoops in the summer from relegated side Cardiff City, is hoping both Redknapp and QPR can make a quick recovery following their split.

'I really want to wish Harry all the best. He's had a great career in English football and I hope he gets his knees fixed up as soon as possible,' Caulker said on sportlobster.com.

'I really hope whoever we get in now can spark us off on a great run in the Premier League.

'In my opinion, we've got more than a good enough squad to stay in the league, so we need to work hard now and make this happen.

'I know the players will stick together and I hope the fans are behind us, as we all need to make this place a fortress again.'

Derby County manager Steve McLaren has also been linked with the vacant position at QPR
