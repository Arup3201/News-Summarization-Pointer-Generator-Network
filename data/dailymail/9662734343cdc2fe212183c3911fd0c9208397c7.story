John Travolta is facing the fourth claim of sexual harassment against him in the space of a week after a former male massage therapist at the Peninsula Hotel claimed the 'Pulp Fiction' star was banned for lewd conduct

A masseur at the posh Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan has claimed that John Travolta was blacklisted for three years from the hotel's spa for inappropriate behaviour.

Former Peninsula masseur Michael Caputo said that Travolta always asked for a man for his massage at the hotel's famous rooftop spa and was barred after several creepy-run ins.

Caputo, 55, said that male staffers complained that the 'Pulp Fiction' star would grind against the massage table, remove the towel and lift his butt in the air during his therapy.

'Travolta would always request a man for his massage, but after a while no one would take him because of his inappropriate behavior,' said Caputo.

'It got to the point where they couldn’t find any men to take him, and they had to ban him,' explained the masseur known as Magic Mike, who said he worked at the Peninsula from 1992-2008.

The ban lasted for three years and happened around a decade ago according to Caputo, who now works from his Queens, New York home offering massages for $100 an hour.

'If he was banned, do you think he’d ever go back?” said Travolta’s attorney, Marty Singer, dismissing the allegation as complete nonsense — noting that his client was at the hotel’s famous rooftop spa as recently as six months ago.

'He’s never been banned, I guarantee you. . . . The hotel never told John he was banned, and John never acted improperly,' according to the New York Daily News.

This new allegation comes as Travolta faced a slight reprieve in the increasingly murky sexual assault allegations against him.

The Peninsula New York: Where John Travolta was allegedly banned according to a masseur who said he worked there from 1992 to 2008

The first masseur, dubbed John Doe #1, who accused the Hollywood star of inappropriate behaviour towards him has been dropped by his attorney.

Okorie Okorocha has apparently had second thoughts about representing the man who now claims he was mistaken about the date of the alleged attack.

He called the date mix up a 'miscalculation' and still insists the assault allegedly happened a few days prior.

The Texan had claimed that Travolta made sexual advances towards him on January 16 2012 and could prove the Grease star was in Los Angeles at the time.

But the A-list star's attorney Marty Singer has produced photographs and a restaurant bill to show that Travolta was in New York at the time and strongly denies the lurid allegations.

'Okorocha did not feel he could represent John Doe #1 going forward anymore and recommend him finding another lawyer,' a source told RadarOnline.

'He is still representing John Doe #2 and other alleged victims who are possibly coming forward.'

Meanwhile, Travolta was hit by fresh sexual harassment claims earlier this week after another man came forward.

Fabian Zanzi has accused Travolta of accosting him back in 2009 while he was working on the Royal Caribbean cruise ship.

Chilean-born Zanzi was an employee on the liner at the time and was in charge of VIP guests.

Going public: Zanzi is the fourth man to come 
forward making sexual assault claims against the actor (right)

Zanzi - the first of the alleged three victims to be publicly named - told South American news website ABC.es that Travolta approached him and offered him $12,000 to have sex with him.

He told the website he refused the Pulp Fiction actor's advances.

Zanzi recalled: 'He 
had something on his neck. I thought it was a fuzz. As I approached, he 
took off his white coat and was naked.

'He hugged me and asked me to do a
 massage.'

New
 York dining: A receipt from a meal the Pulp Fiction actor ate at Mr. 
Chow restaurant in New York on the same day has also emerged

Reports suggest Zanzi has filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Travolta - although this has yet to be verified.

The news comes following claims from 
two unidentified masseurs alleging Travolta sexually assaulted them. 
They are suing for $2m in damages.

Travolta's lawyer, Marty Singer has strenuously denied the two initial claims and is yet to comment on the latest allegations.

The
 first two masseurs to come forward have been named as John Doe #1 and 
John Doe #2 in U.S. lawsuits. Both are being represented by lawyer 
Okorie Okorocha and claim the Grease actor made sexually advances 
towards them.

Yesterday 
Travolta's camp put forward photographic evidence which appeared to 
provide Travolta with an alibi with regard to claims by John Doe #1, who
 alleges he was assaulted by the actor on January 16 of this year at a Beverly Hills hotel in Los Angeles.

Travolta's lawyers, however, claim the actor was in New York City on that date - releasing a restaurant receipt from the Mr. Chow restaurant in NYC and two photographs of the actor as evidence.

It is claimed by TMZ.com that
 two photos show him first at 4:30pm and then again at 5:21pm, at a 
fitting for his upcoming movie Killing Season in the Big Apple.

In a new development today, the New York Daily News
 reports flight records prove Travolta landed in Westchester, New York, 
hours before sunrise on the day John Doe #1 claims the alleged sexual 
harassment took place in Los Angeles.

It supports the actor's alibi he was 3,000 miles away from the scene of the alleged groping.

In
 another bizarre twist the unidentified masseur has released a statement
 wishing Travolta 'health and happiness' - despite pressing ahead with 
the lawsuit.

In a statement to RadarOnline he said: 'Even though Mr Travolta and his counsel
 are on opposing sides in this matter, I do wish them good health, 
happiness, and want them to be judged with absolute fairness as our 
great nation affords all citizens regardless of their wealth or 
station.'

Lawsuit:
 Travolta, pictured with wife Kelly Preston, is facing accusations of 
inappropriate sexual behaviour towards at least three men

Yesterday a second man filed filed a lawsuit claiming the actor tried to grab his
penis during a massage session on January 28 in Atlanta.

RadarOnline
 claims to know the hotel where the alleged incident took place and has 
spoken to a member of staff there who says employees have been warned 
they will be fired if they speak to the media.

Okorocha, the lawyer representing the first two alleged victims - claims there are over 100 other men prepared to
come forward with similar stories about the Hairspray star.

He told
RadarOnline.com: 'By the time this case is over Marty Singer [Travolta's lawyer] will have to
accuse more than 100 men of lying because I have been contacted by people,
mostly men, that have first hand information about similar behaviour on John
Travolta's part to that contained in the lawsuits.

Second accuser: Court papers were amended when the second masseur claimed sexual battery by the star

'I have already filed against him.
I have witnesses and the potential for more accusers in virtually every state
of the union who have called me. I'm currently in the process of investigating
their claims and verifying the information before possible further action is
taken.'

John - a
devout Scientologist - has been married to Kelly Preston since 1991.

Their
oldest child Jett died in 2009 at the age of 17 and they have two other children Ella Blue, 11, and 23-month-old Benjamin.
