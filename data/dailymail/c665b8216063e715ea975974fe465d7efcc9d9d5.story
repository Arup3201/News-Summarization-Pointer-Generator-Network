Selena Gomez has been banned from Facebook - but fans of the Disney actress need not launch into uproar just yet.

For the unfortunate victim of the online ban is not Justin Bieber's girlfriend with a million-dollar film career - but an 18-year-old girl called Selena Miranda Gomez from New Mexico.

When she tried to sign into Facebook last week, she was told via email that her account had been shut down because it was 'inauthentic'.

Real deal: The Facebook account of Disney actress Selena Gomez. Unfortunately for one teenager with the same name, her account was shut down after she was dubbed an imposter

Miss Gomez told TMZ: 'I AM NOT AN IMPOSTOR ... My name is not hers on my page. In fact, I even put my middle name on my FB to clear up any confusion.'

She has asked Facebook to reactivate her account but so far has had no response.

Under Facebook guidelines, an account which pretends to be a real individual is not allowed.

The other Selena Gomez, 20, was hard at work on her new film Parental Guidance this week. The starlet was also snapped taking a lunch break with Bieber in Woodland Hills, California.

Anti-social: Facebook offers advice on how to get rid of fake accounts which are against company policy

It was announced last week that Facebook is to close 83 million accounts that the company believes to be fake or spam.

Many are accounts that have been set up for users' pets or babies - when anyone who wants to do that, should really be creating a fan page.

Facebook did not specify a date when it would be getting rid of these accounts.
