Five members of Francois Hollande's personal staff have lost their jobs after photos were taken of the president and his 'secret' lover at the Elysee Palace.

The French president ordered the transfer of the officials following the publication of the hugely embarrassing images in gossip magazine Voici.

Taken last month, they showed the 60-year-old Socialist with Julie Gayet, the 42-year-old TV actress.

Their long-term affair was uncovered in January, leading to Valerie Trieweiler, Mr Holland's 'official' girlfriend being kicked out of the Elysee Palace.

She suffered a brief nervous breakdown, and then went on to write a lucrative kiss-and-tell book which she was promoting in Britain last week.

Ms Gayet, a divorced mother of two, disappeared from public view for months, but the blurry photographers of her on a private terrace of the Elysee with Mr Hollande appeared last week.

The French presidency today confirmed that five members of Mr Hollande's presidential staff were being sent to different jobs away from his 'private service.'

There was no possibility of paparazzi having got into the highly secure presidential home in Paris, prompting the speculation that the pictures were taken by staff.

'Five were immediately placed in the frame, and they are the ones who have been moved on to other duties,' said a governmental source in Paris.

He said investigators did not know the exact person who had taken the snaps, so all five were 'being let go'.

To add a further twist to the soap opera, four were originally appointed to their prestigious jobs by Nicolas Sarkozy, the former conservative president.

He is desperate to retake the presidency from Mr Hollande, leading to speculation that he had engineered the latest drama to embarrass his detested rival.

The photos – which are thought to have been taken with a simple phone camera – were distributed by an agency with close links to Mr Sarkozy's third wife, the former supermodel Carla Bruni.

The images of Mr Hollande and Ms Gayet were the first ever of them in public together, and appeared as Ms Trierweiler portrayed the president as a cheating liar.

Not only did she say he was a cynical love cheat, but insisted he was a hypocritical Socialist who secretly despises the poor and refers to them as 'the toothless'.

Ms Trierweiler's best-selling book, 'Thank You For This Moment', has been translated into 12 languages and has just come out in the UK.

It is likely to end any hope Mr Hollande has of retaining the presidency following the 2017 elections. His current approval rating is less than 13 per cent.
