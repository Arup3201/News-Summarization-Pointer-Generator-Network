A councillor who is in charge of his authority's policy on traveller sites has been forced to apologise after an email he sent telling gypsies to 'f*** off' was leaked by rival politicians.

Mark Howell sent colleagues at South Cambridgeshire District Council a picture of a mocked-up road sign suggesting towed caravans should be banned - with the words 'F*** off gypos' underneath.

The email suggested that the council might make use of the image adding: 'Do you think the county will order some?'

Although the email was circulated among district councillors six years ago when he was a member of an independent group, details have only just emerged after the email was revealed by his political rivals.

Now a Conservative, Councillor Howell is cabinet member for housing - which leaves South Cambridgeshire's policy on traveller sites under his jurisdiction.

Opposition councillors have now called for Mr Howell to quit.

Haslingfield and The Eversdens representative Robin Page said that his rival's behaviour was 'intolerable'.

He added: 'I think it's just disgraceful. I think that not only should he resign from cabinet, he should resign as a councillor.'

But Mr Howell said yesterday that the email had not compromised his position, despite admitting that he 'stupidly' circulated it.

He said: 'The email from more than six years ago was nothing more than a private joke between friends in the independent group I was a member of at the time, which is now being used for nothing more than political gain.

'Anyone who knows me will know I do not support the views contained within it and have worked tirelessly for all residents since becoming a councillor.

'In hindsight it was a stupid thing to have sent and i can only apologise if anyone takes offence.'

Controversy surrounds the Mettle Hill site which South Cambridgeshire District Council plans on buying and reopening as a traveller site

Details of the email have come to light as Councillor Howell backs plans to reopen a controversial traveller site in Meldrith, Cambridgeshire.

He has also been accused by rival politicians of ignoring two other possible sites for travellers.

Plans to buy and reopen the Mettle Hill site were revealed last Wednesday with an estimated 20 extra pitches needed up until 2031 to meet the authority's legal obligation to supply enough housing for travellers.

The project will cost the authority Â£500,000 and has already been opposed by South Cambridgeshire MP and Leader of the House of Commons Andrew Lansley.
