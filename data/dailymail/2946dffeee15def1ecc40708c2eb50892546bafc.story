Bath have announced renewed contracts for back-row trio Matt Garvey, Leroy Houston and Guy Mercer.

Both Garvey and Houston arrived at the Recreation Ground ahead of last season, while Mercer moved through the club's academy system to senior status in 2011.

'Matt, Leroy and Guy are all talented players and offer different qualities that give us a good variety and strength in depth in the back-row,' Bath head coach Mike Ford said.

'They are passionate about the club and committed to what we are trying to achieve here.'
