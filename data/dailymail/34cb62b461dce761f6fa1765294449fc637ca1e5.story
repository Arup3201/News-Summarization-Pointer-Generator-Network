A woman accused of snatching a newborn baby from hospital after dressing up as a nurse has been ordered by a judge to undergo psychiatric evaluation.

Valerie Poulin-Collins, 21, allegedly grabbed day-old baby Victoria from the maternity ward at Trois-Rivieres in Quebec, Canada, on Monday night.

She hid her face in her hands during a court hearing after being charged with kidnapping and child abduction.

A judge granted a request for her to 
be assessed in hospital by a psychiatrist after her lawyer argued that 
she wasn't fit to answer questions, it was reported by the Toronto Sun.

She was arrested on Thursday after being discharged from hospital following a suspected drug overdose.

Victoria's
 parents claim a woman dressed in scrubs tricked them into handing over 
their daughter on the pretence that she need to be weighed after walking
 into their room at around 7pm on Monday.

Her terrified parents, Mélissa McMahon and Simon Boisclair, contacted authorities and an Amber Alert was quickly issued.

The alert featured a photo of a woman, dressed in red hospital 
scrubs, on hospital surveillance footage around 7pm and soon afterwards,
 in a red Toyota Yaris with a Baby On Board sign.

New parents Mélissa McMahon and Simon Boisclair, posted a picture of themselves with baby Victoria after she was quickly returned following being snatched from a Quebec maternity ward

Fortunately, the Amber Alert was seen on Facebook by a group of young friends - Charlène
 Plante, Mélizanne Bergeron, Charel Bergeron and Marc-André Côté - one 
of whom, Miss Plante, identified the suspect as a former neighbour.

In
 under 30 minutes, they drove to the woman's home and saw the same car 
parked outside - and the woman inside with the baby, according to The Globe And Mail.

The friends then contacted the police and the little girl was rescued - around 30 minutes after the alert was issued.

The 21-year-old suspect was arrested and is now being monitored in hospital.

Ms McMahon said that she knew something was wrong after she saw the 'nurse' walk off with her baby in her arms.

The new mother ran to the hospital entrance but could see no sign of her baby or the woman.

Ms McMahon, a shop assistant whose partner is a firefighter, wrote on Facebook: 'Four 
marvellous people, that we had a chance to meet, identified the woman 
thanks to Facebook.

The little girl was rescued and her relieved mother posted messages of gratitude on her Facebook page

'It’s the only reason why Victoria is in our arms 
right now. Our thanks to all Quebeckers who made an extra efforts.'

She also warned new mothers not to be so trusting of anyone wearing a hospital uniform.

Ms Bergeron, a nursing student, told The Globe And Mail that it was a big relief to find the baby safe and well.
