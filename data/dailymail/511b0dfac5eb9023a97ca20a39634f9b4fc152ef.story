Dick Whittington once said that London Streets were paved with gold.

But if he had visited this dual carriageway in China, the geography in his famous saying could have been rather different.

These stunning photos shows corn seeds being dried  in China's Henan province, converting the giant highway into a makeshift Yellow Brick Road.

Villagers in Zhengzhou spent hours painstakingly laying out the seeds to bask in the sun rays, turning the black tarmac into a golden ocean.

The maize is spread laboriously over the road by the workers' hands - as cars and other signs of China's modern world carry on whizzing by beside them.

This is how Chinese farms traditionally dry corn because they do not have large machines to do the drying for them. 

The tarmac warms up in the sun, providing an ideal cost-saving way to dry the province's corn crop.

The tarmac warms up in the sun's rays and so makes an ideal cost-saving way to dry the maize

These pictures show the tradition juxtaposed with China's more modern side of vehicles and tarmac roads

The tradition goes on throughout the country but is particularly popular in this province
