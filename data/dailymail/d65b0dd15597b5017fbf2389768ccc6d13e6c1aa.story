She is one of the most successful singers of last year with her album Red going multi-platinum in the U.S. alone.

And Taylor Swift sported a gown befitting Country royalty on Sunday, stealing the show at the Academy of Country Music Awards in Las Vegas in a stunning metallic dress.

The 23-year-old star wore her blonde hair straight and up in a chic ponytail, teaming the unusual chain-mail style old-gold gown with just a pair of subtle jewelled earrings.

Were Trouble singer's fans at the ceremony at the MGM Grand Garden Arena
in Las Vegas.

Asked if he had any advice for Luke, Blake said: 'I
would tell him to be prepared for the onslaught of hatred that will 
come from Taylor Swift's fan base if you say any sort of a joke or if 
she's any part of a punch line in the monologue.'
