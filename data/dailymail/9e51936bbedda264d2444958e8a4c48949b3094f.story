Police arrested three women at a Valentine's Day screening of Fifty Shades of Grey after reports a man was glassed .

Officers were called to the Grosvenor cinema in Glasgow on Saturday night after reports a group of 'drunk and rowdy' women had turned violent.

Witnesses said movie-goers were vomiting in the aisles of the cinema - where alcoholic drinks are served - before the alleged attack.

Police were called to the Grosvenor Cinema in Glasgow's Ashton Lane on Saturday after an incident inside. Witnesses say a group of women had got drunk before attacking a man who asked them to be quiet

The cinema is the city's Ashton Lane, a West End street popular for its many pubs and nightclubs.

Witnesses say a group of women were being rowdy during a showing of the erotic film, based on E.L. James's bestseller.

It is reported that a man asked to group to keep the noise down when he was attacked with a glass by one of the women.

Michael Bolton, who was at the screening, told The Daily Record: '[A woman] said that three or four girls had been very loud and were shouting. The man had asked them to shut up and he was glassed... Only in Glasgow are police called to the cinema.'

Witnesses said cinema staff were left cleaning up blood from the cinema floor after the incident.

The man's injuries were not serious and he did not need hospital treatment. 

Three women were arrested on suspicion of disorder offences, Police Scotland said.

The alleged attack was during a screening of Fifty Shades of Grey, the erotic film starring Dakota Johnson (pictured) based on E.L. James's book

The force spokesman said: 'At 8pm on Saturday, 14 February, police responded to reports of a disturbance at the Grosvenor Cinema on Ashton Lane, Glasgow. Police sources have denied glass was used in the attack.

'Three women were arrested for alleged disorder offences. Inquiries continue to determine the full circumstances of the incident.'

A spokeswoman for Grosvenor cinema said: 'I can confirm that an incident occurred on Saturday 14 February following an early evening showing of 50 Shades Of Grey.

'This was an isolated incident that was dealt with rapidly by cinema staff and stewards, as a result of which, Police Scotland attended and made an arrest.

'Despite press reports, nobody was glassed and a wine bottle was not used as a weapon. Those involved did not require hospital attention.

'We welcomed nearly 2000 customers over the weekend, including four further showings on Saturday night which passed without incident.'
