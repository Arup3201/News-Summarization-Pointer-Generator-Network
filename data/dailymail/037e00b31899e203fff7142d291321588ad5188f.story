Her usual passengers are tourists who pay to cruise along the Thames past London’s most historic sites.

But next year Spirit of Chartwell will take up her own berth in the 
history books – at the head of a  magnificent 1,000-strong flotilla celebrating the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

Award-winning film production designer Joseph Bennett and former 
model-turned television garden expert Rachel De Thame have been brought 
in to transform the already luxurious 210ft cruiser into a Royal Barge 
which will recall the splendour of the 17th Century.

Luxurious: The 210ft Spirit of Chartwell as she is today. The cruiser was originally built in Rotterdam in the Netherlands in 2000, but was given an overhaul after it was acquired by the Magna Carta Steamship Company

And an official artist’s impression released yesterday reveals the extent of the makeover.

Elaborate gold gilt sculptures will be added, along with lavish red 
carpets, velvet drapes and two thrones beneath a canopy. Several 
Royal-themed floral displays will be made up of flowers from the Queen’s
own gardens.

Pageant Master Adrian Evans, who is organising the Thames Diamond 
Jubilee Pageant, said: ‘The Royal Barge must be a jewel – the most 
magnificent vessel in the flotilla. Joseph and Rachel have come up with a
truly inspiring design.’

Bennett, who won an Emmy for his work on the television blockbuster 
Rome, was keen to produce a vessel which recalled the glory days of the 
great State barges of the 17th and 18th Centuries.

But his final design will also incorporate features celebrating each of the past six decades of the Queen’s reign.

He said: ‘We’re trying to make every decorative element tell a story that’s relevant to the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

‘Aspects such as her coronation, the Commonwealth countries, the 60 years of her reign, we want to reference all of these.

Honoured: Former model-turned-TV garden expert Rachel De Thame has been given the task of revamping the Spirit of Chartwell. She has chosen to bedeck the vessel with red, gold and purple flowers

‘And as far as possible, we’ll also make every effort to use specialist craftsmen based in Britain.’

De Thame, 50, who now presents the BBC’s Gardeners’ World and 
Countrywise on ITV, has chosen red, gold and purple flowers and her 
designs will also reference the Commonwealth, the coronation and the 
Gold State Coach.

She said: ‘I feel extremely honoured to be involved in
the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. My aim is to help make the day a 
truly special one for the Queen.’

During the Thames trip, the Queen and Prince Philip will be centre stage
on the two thrones, which have been specially positioned under a 
gold-gilted canopy to ensure crowds are given the best possible view of 
the pair.

Palace officials are currently deciding which other senior Royals will be on the barge.

What is certain is that Her Majesty will be accompanied by members of 
the Royal Watermen, whose ceremonial duty is to accompany the Monarch on
all her official journeys by river.

The watermen, chosen from those whose regular business is manning tugs 
and launches on the Thames, are paid a token sum of £3.50 a year for 
their Royal role.

They will be instantly recognisable in their black caps and scarlet 
tunics, with the silver Royal cypher on both front and back.

They will be led by the Queen’s official bargemaster, a post dating back to 1215 and which is currently held by Paul Ludwig.

The Spirit of Chartwell was originally constructed in Rotterdam in the 
Netherlands in 2000, but was rebuilt last year following its acquisition
by the Magna Carta Steamship Company.

Although her day job is running Thames trips for paying guests, the Chartwell is far from being a bog-standard cruiser.

In fact, according to one commentator, to describe the vessel as a pleasure cruiser is ‘like calling the Queen Mary a ferry’.

According to the craft’s website, her interiors are modelled on the 
‘timeless grandeur’ of the 1929 Pullman railway carriage and features 
include 33 upholstered seats and original fixtures and fittings from 
ocean liners.

The walls are adorned with original glass panels by celebrated French 
designer Rene Lalique and the vessel boasts panoramic windows and 
hardwood finishes throughout.

Her nine-hour Memories of London voyage, which includes a champagne 
reception, three-course lunch and a gala dinner, costs from £195 and 
£265 per person.

Last night, her owner Philip Morrell said: ‘As the Spirit of Chartwell 
evolved, I knew we had built something special – ideal, I thought, for 
the carriage of royalty.

‘But little did I even vaguely suspect that in the course of one short year we should be graced with such an honour.’

Celebration: Her Majesty and Prince Philip will be accompanied on the journey by members of the Royal Watermen, whose ceremonial duty is to accompany the Monarch on all her official journeys by river, when she marks 60 years on the throne in June next year

Up until the mid-19th Century the Monarch would regularly travel on the 
Thames either on ceremonial occasions or between the different palaces.

As other means of transport began to prove more efficient, however, it was deemed no longer necessary to keep a Royal Barge.

The Queen does occasionally make use of the Royal Nore, a vessel made available to her by the Port of London authority.

It has been involved in State visits since 1971 and carries the Royal Standard and Regalia when the Queen is aboard.

The Diamond Jubilee celebrations will take place over a four-day Bank Holiday weekend from June 2 to 5 next year.
