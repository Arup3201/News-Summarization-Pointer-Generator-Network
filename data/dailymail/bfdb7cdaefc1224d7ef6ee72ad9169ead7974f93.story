It was just an average day in the Northern Territory according to one local man, whose car trip was interrupted by an unexpected visitor.

Shane Compain, from Darwin, was driving from the CBD to Cobourg for a weekend fishing trip at about 9pm when he was forced to stop at the main crossing where a four metre long crocodile was lazing about.

'It just wouldn't move,' Mr Compain told Daily Mail Australia.

Shane Compain was on his way to a weekend fishing trip in the Northern Territory when he was forced to stop his car due to a four-metre-long crocodile that was resting on the main crossing

'He was sitting on the road for about two minutes before I got my camera out.'

The video shows an enormous crocodile resting on the left side of the road, unmoving. 

After some shouting and flashing of lights, the fierce animal finally began to retreat into the grass by the side of the road, allowing the car to pass by.

But the spectacle is a normal one in Arnhem Land according to Mr Compain, who said he often catches sight of the reptiles at his favourite fishing location.

'It's pretty run of the mill, he's just a little extra big,' he said of the event.

Mr Compain said crocodiles were a regular sight in the area and that the only thing that was strange about this particular encounter was the sheer size of the reptile 

'I was just worried that he could have done a fair bit of damage to the car.' 

The fisherman certainly appeared quite unperturbed in his recording, in which his companion could be heard calling out: 'move out of the way'.

'We've got a crocodile in the way,' Mr Compain is heard saying before the croc finally darts off the road, at which point his friend is heard saying: 'Bye, bye gypsy'.
