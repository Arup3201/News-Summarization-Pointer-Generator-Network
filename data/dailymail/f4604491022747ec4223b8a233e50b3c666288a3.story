Police are hunting for Huw Norfolk, 27, an anarchist known as Badger, who they want to question over an arson attack on a phone mast and vandalism on newspaper offices

A middle-class anarchist suspected of causing criminal damage worth around £300,000 has had a £10,000 bounty placed on his head.

Huw Norfolk, the son of a poet and a nuclear energy adviser, has been on the run for three years.

Known as Badger, the heavily tattooed 27-year-old has links to anarchist communities across southern England, Europe and South America.

Unable to track him down, police have taken the ‘quite unique’ step for a crime of this nature by offering a financial reward of £10,000 for information as to his whereabouts.

Meanwhile, his parents have been left to deal with the humiliation of a manhunt for their son and have been questioned by police at the £700,000 family home in Cheltenham.

His father, Dr David Norfolk, 64, is a Cambridge-educated company director who specialises in nuclear energy. His company, Norfolk Garrett Consultancy, advises nuclear operators on environmental regulations.

His mother, Gill Garrett, 65, is a poet, writer and former lecturer. The couple have told Avon and Somerset Police they have ‘no clue as to his whereabouts’ and have had no contact with their son for some time.

The Norfolks also have a 29-year-old daughter who is a volunteer officer in the health and social care sector and an accomplished archer.

She attended Pate’s Grammar School in Cheltenham, one of the UK’s leading state schools. Their son is suspected of setting fire to a communications mast in Bath which caused about £300,000 worth of damage and knocked out the power to thousands of homes.

He is also accused of causing criminal damage to the Bristol Post newspaper office during the August 2011 riots.

Officers are investigating more than 100 incidents that have resulted in a combined £20million worth of damage and say they cannot rule out his links to these other attacks. Police first appealed locally for information on Norfolk’s whereabouts in 2011 but it yielded no results. His last known address was in Bristol city centre but police said he had could have fled the country by now.

A letter attributed to him and posted online in November 2011 said: ‘My decision is not to comply with my judicial persecution.’ With little to go on officers decided to put the £10,000 bounty on his head.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Bevan, who is leading the investigation, said: ‘Norfolk is wanted in connection with these two serious crimes and we’re asking the public to help us to find him.

The arson attack at Bathampton mast on January 3, 2013, caused damage worth several hundred thousand pounds and affected TV, radio and mobile phone signals to thousands of homes and businesses, including sole and small-scale traders and independent businesses that rely on their telephones to work and trade.

Police from the Avon and Somerset force (pictured) believe Norfolk has connections to anarchist groups responsible for 60 fires around Bath, and other groups in Pembrokshire, Bristol, and London

‘It robbed many people of their only lifeline in the event of an emergency and put the lives of thousands of innocent adults and children at risk.’

He said the incident at the Bristol Post building, which saw windows smashed and paint thrown at it, caused thousands of pounds worth of ‘mindless criminal damage’.

‘Both incidents caused huge disruption to the lives of innocent people and we’re taking them extremely seriously,’ DCI Bevan added.

Norfolk is white, of a slight build and around 5ft 9in. He has green eyes and sometimes wears spectacles.

The anarchist is known to regularly change his appearance and give false details, including the name of Geoffrey or Howard.
