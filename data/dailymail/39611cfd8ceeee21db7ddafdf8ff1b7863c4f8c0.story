British hostage David Haines was kidnapped by 'professional' ISIS gunmen in a 'pre-planned' ambush that took just seconds, a witness today revealed

British hostage David Haines was kidnapped by 'professional' ISIS gunmen on an isolated road in northern Syria in an attack that took just seconds, an eyewitness today revealed.

A Syrian translator, who worked for the same charity as Mr Haines, said they were driving back to Turkey via Aleppo as part of a four-strong group when the militants struck.

Travelling in two cars, the masked gunmen ambushed their vehicle, before ordering them to 'get out' and restraining Mr Haines and their Italian colleague Federico Motka.

They then threw the pair into the boots of their cars, while one placed a gun to the translator's head and threatened him with death if he told anyone what he had seen.

Finally, they shot out the tyres of the victims' car, before driving off with Mr Haines and Mr Motka, who was released by the terror group in May.

The witness, who did not wish to be named, told The Independent: 'Two
 very fast cars came up behind – one overtook and the other stayed 
behind. They shouted at us to get out of the car in formal Arabic. They 
were wearing black masks and were so professional.

'They put [Mr Haines and Mr Motka] in the boot of their car and shot out the tyres of our car. One of them put a gun to my head and threatened me not to tell anyone what I had seen.'

The translator said the attack took place 'in seconds' and the militants, at least one of whom was a foreigner of African origin, appeared to have known that Westerners were travelling the car.

'They knew that two of us were Syrians and they knew who else was in the car,' he said.

The group, all of whom worked for the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED), had been travelling back from a three-day tour of potential new locations for Syrian refugee camps in March 2013 when they were attacked.

They had been taking a shortcut down an isolated farm road near Atmeh refugee camp and were just miles from the Turkish border.

The camp houses more than 30,000 
refugees and is less than a mile from the hilltop of a village.

It has 
become a rallying point for foreign jihadists who have targeted aid 
workers, journalists and members of the Syrian Free Army.

The translator's account will raise questions over whether ISIS was tipped off as to the whereabouts of Mr Haines by 
someone known to him in Syria.

It comes as David Cameron is preparing to personally brief a member of the Haines family on the latest developments in the case.

On Tuesday, the 44-year-old was shown kneeling in the sand wearing an orange jumpsuit on a video of the beheading of a U.S. hostage.

The Prime Minister, who is coming under 
growing pressure to unleash a military response, said Britain would use 
'everything we have in our armoury' to squeeze ISIS out of existence.

Yesterday, he told fellow Nato leaders not to pay ransoms for hostages as 
it only increases kidnappings and funds further terrorism.

Born in Yorkshire but raised in Scotland, Mr Haines is a veteran of front line aid work in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.

Prime Minister David Cameron has ruled out paying a ransom for Mr Haines' release

Mr Haines's former landlady in Croatia, 
where he worked for the German aid agency Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund, last 
night described him as a 'good man' who was 'loved by everyone'.

Nena
 Skoric, 67, whom Mr Haines affectionately called 'Mama', told The 
Telegraph: 'To me, it was like God had sent David to this place.

'It
 didn't matter to him whether people were Croats, Serbs or Muslims, as 
long as they needed help. There were many families who had lost 
everything, but they all loved David. For years after he left, they 
would come here and ask how he was.'

Mrs Skoria added that she 
has been crying for two days since finding out about Mr Haines's plight,
 and has been having nightmares of him 'kneeling in the desert in an 
orange suit.'

Her comments came as Mr Haines's wife Dragana, 43, revealed she cries for her husband 'every 
day' and maintains she will not reveal any details of his plight to 
their four-year-old daughter.

Mrs Haines, who lives in Sisak, Croatia, said the toddler asks about her father on a daily basis, but she has not yet told the girl that he is missing.

She told The Times: 'His safety means everything to us. My daughter is only four-years-old and she does not know the situation.

‘We
have not told her that her daddy is missing. I am trying to protect 
her. When he is safe and here [at home] we will be 
happy.'

Mr Haines also has a 17-year-old daughter who lives in Perth, Scotland.
