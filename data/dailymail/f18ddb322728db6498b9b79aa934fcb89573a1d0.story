From Cara Delevingne rocking a suit on the red carpet to Brad and Angelina wearing matching androgynous outfits to the BAFTAS, fashion icons have never been scared to experiment with gender.

And one major retailing is jumping on the bandwagon by blurring the lines between men's and womenswear. 

Selfridges has launched a 'gender-neutral' fashion campaign encouraging consumers to buy clothes without being restricted to men's or women's fashions.

Selfridges has launched a 'gender-neutral' fashion campaign encouraging consumers to buy clothes without being restricted to men's or women's fashions as it opens the doors to its 'agender' shopping space

The Oxford Street department store has axed its separate women and menswear departments in favour of three floors of unisex fashion. 

Selfridges believe that shoppers no longer want to be defined or limited by their gender as to what they can wear. Instead, they are able to shop for unisex or 'agender' clothing and the store describe the new concept as a celebration of fashion without definition. 

As part of Agender, Selfridges has created a unique genderless shopping experience across fashion, accessories and beauty.

Devised by renowned designer Faye Toogood, the space is an environment in which shoppers are given the freedom to transcend notions of 'his' and 'hers', as you simply find your most desired item by colour, fit and style.

Selfridges has launched five unisex collections and 'agender' pieces from forty of its regular brands. Beauty products and accessories for men and women will also be mixed. 

Among the unisex lines on offer - many exclusive - is a capsule collection by Bodymap, the U.K. launch of Nicola Formichetti’s collection Nicopanda, a collection from footwear label Underground and Rad Hourani’s made-to-order couture designs.

Designs by labels including Ann Demeulemeester, Comme des Garçons, Meadham Kirchoff and Gareth Pugh also feature in the lineup.

'For us, Agender is not about harnessing a "trend" but rather tapping into a mind-set and acknowledging and responding a cultural shift that is happening now,' explained a Selfridges spokesperson.

'We will explore the relationship between gender and retail physically, digitally and in all of our stores.

'The project will act as a test bed for experimentation around ideas of gender – both to allow our shoppers to approach the experience without preconceptions and for us as retailers to move the way we shop fashion forward.'

It comes as Selfridges bosses say they have seen a huge surge in women buying menswear as part of the trends for looser clothing and more masculine tailoring this year. 

Photography, film, music and design pieces exploring the idea of gender are also on display in all four  stores and on Selfridges.com throughout the campaign.

Brands at the store, such as KTZ, Trapstar and Hood By Air, are already popular with women looking for a more androgynous style.

While the unisex Boy London saw a massive surge in popularity when singer Rhianna and supermodel Cara Delevingne were seen sporting their range.

Jane Shepper, chief executive of Whistles, which has collaboration with Swedish company Stutterheim to create unisex raincoats, said the line between men and womenswear was becoming blurred.

'A lot of our men's collection influences our women's and vice versa,' she added.

Cos and Gap have all noticed increases in the number of women buying menswear, while men have also been picking up women's knitwear for themselves.

While there has been a swathe of high-profile unisex models, such as Elliott Sailors, who work for both mens and womenswear brands.
