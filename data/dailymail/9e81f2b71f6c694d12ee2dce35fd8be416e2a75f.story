New York City developers have begun working to turn a desolate railroad storage yard in Manhattan into a upscale new neighborhood filled with office skyscrapers, modern apartment towers and a slew of restaurants, bars and entertainment venues.

Developers, realtors and local officials on Tuesday held a groundbreaking ceremony for Hudson Yards’ first office tower -- a 48-story building scheduled to be finished by 2015.

The $15 billion, 26-acre project on the far west side of Midtown Manhattan will eventually include an arts building and a public square, developers say.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the property, is leasing the land to developers for $1 billion.

‘This is the future of New York,’ said Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a big proponent of the Hudson Yards project.

The city rezoned 60 blocks to accommodate the project, approved $106 million in property tax exemptions and issued $3 billion in bonds to pay for an extension of the 7 train subway that now goes to Times Square.

The completion of Hudson Yards will take about a dozen years, developers and officials say.

The project entails the construction of an $800 million platform to cover the existing railroad tracks. The new office tower in the works will not require that platform.

For several years the Bloomberg administration has made efforts to revitalize the area, which was the focal point of an unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics.

Developer Stephen Ross, chairman of the privately-owned real estate giant Related Companies, compared the Hudson Yards project to the creation of the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Lincoln Center and other iconic New York structures.

Related has tentative deals in place 
for two new tenants to occupy the first tower, making the Kohn Pedersen 
Fox-designed skyscraper more than 80 per cent committed to occupants, 
Ross said as construction began.

He declined to name the new tenants.

U.S. luxury handbag producer Coach had previously agreed to relocate its headquarters to the new building, which will reach 47 stories and include 1.7 million square feet (158,000 square meters) of space, Bloomberg News reports.

Related is also planning to build its own 13.3 million-square-foot complex in Hudson Yards.

New York City's commercial real estate market had been severely impacted by the great recession, and some projects, including towers planned at the World Trade Center site, have struggled to find tenants.

Mayor Bloomberg said that Tuesday’s groundbreaking shows that ‘we are moving forward’ ‘even in this challenging economy.’

The project will create an estimated 23,000 construction jobs and space for more than 40,000 people to live or work, the mayor said.

But as with most big development projects, Hudson Yards also has its share of opponents and skeptics.

Kathleen Treat, who chairs the Hell’s Kitchen Neighborhood Association, recently called the project 'Hong Kong on the Hudson,' a reference to the densely populated city in Asia with people living in clustered high-rises.

Others, including Columbia Business School real estate professor Lynne Sagalyn, have questioned whether there will be enough tenants to make the project viable in the long run.

The city had previously planned to build a new stadium for the New York Jets in the same location, but the proposal caused ongoing disagreement among residents, businesspeople and politicians, and the 'West side Stadium' fell short of state approval.
