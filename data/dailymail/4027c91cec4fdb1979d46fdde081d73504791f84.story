Steve Bruce sits alone behind a desk in a bar in the Daknamstadion, a 9,500-seat outpost in north-west Belgium.

There is no UEFA translator, no opposition manager, his stage is makeshift and some of the local journalists are supping Jupiler beer.

It is about as far removed as imaginable from the fanfare which would accompany a press conference at a venue such as Inter Milan’s San Siro home.

Special prize: Hull City could face Inter Milan if they can get past Sporting Club Lokeren

Bruce, though, is 180 minutes away from the possibility of such a tie.

‘That (San Siro) is the ultimate,’ said the Hull boss ahead of Thursday's Europa League first-leg play-off against Sporting Club Lokeren. 

‘It’s for the players, the club and the supporters more than anything, to go and have a night out at San Siro.

‘No disrespect to Lokeren, where we are now, but that’s the aim and that’s where we want to be in the next round if we can.

‘I’ve never played at San Siro, but I have been there. It would be fantastic.’

Harry Maguire will make his debut but fellow summer signing Robert Snodgrass is set to miss the majority of the season after dislocating his kneecap.

Ready for action: Hull prepare for Thursday's Europa League first-leg play-off in Belgium

The Scot, a £7million arrival from Norwich City, will be out for around six months and Bruce, who sold Shane Long to Southampton for £12m last week, is very much in the market for reinforcements.

‘We’re working tirelessly,’ he said. ‘If I had this press conference a week ago I would not think I would be sat here without Shane Long and Robert Snodgrass.

‘We’ll have to try to bring a replacement in.’ 

This is Bruce’s first foray into continental competition as a manager. He was, though, just 10 minutes away from an embarrassing exit against Slovakian minnows AS Trencin earlier this month.

‘It would have been devastating to go out,’ he said. ‘We’re under no illusion about how difficult it is going to be for us and it would be wrong for me to damn the competition when we have never been in it for 100 years. The easy thing would be to say, “we don’t want to take part” — but what sort of message would that be?

‘It’s a fantastic competition and we’re going to try to enjoy it.

‘The people of Hull, we saw last time with a full house, are delighted to see us play in Europe. We’ve got to try to do as best we can and see if we can get into the group stage.’

Hull face Stoke at the KC Stadium on Sunday, and Bruce went on: ‘The biggest challenge for all of us is handling the demands of playing another game back in the Premier League at the weekend – far bigger clubs with better resources than us have struggled.

‘The easy thing would be to say “we don’t want to take part” – but what sort of message would that be?

‘It’s a fantastic competition and we’re going to try to enjoy it.’

Bruce would certainly enjoy the San Siro.
