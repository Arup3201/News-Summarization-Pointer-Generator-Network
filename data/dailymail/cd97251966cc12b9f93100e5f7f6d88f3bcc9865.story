It's no secret that advertising is often targeted to online users, but it may surprise you to learn the extent to which pricing is also personalized.

According to a study by computer scientists at Northeastern University, many major e-commerce sites personalize prices per customer, depending on what software they use or their browser history.

The difference in costs can be as large as ten per cent, and most sites don't even warn you when they are using price steering techniques.

Different person, different price: According to a new study, major e-commerce sites like Travelocity and Home Depot personalize prices per customer, depending on what software they use and their browser history

One of the culprits guilty of 'price discrimination' - customizing the prices of products - is travel-booking website Orbitz. 

Researchers found that users who are logged onto the Orbitz website are charged an average of $12 less than those who are not logged on.

The same goes for online travel services company CheapTickets. Neither CheapTickets nor Orbitz tells customers that prices alter depending on the user.

Websites also discriminate based on what devices customers are logged onto. For example, Travelocity offers an unspoken $15 discount for people using Apple's iOS operating system. 

Home Depot, on the other hand, suggests products that are about $100 more expensive to customers using a mobile device, as opposed to those on a desktop computer.

Expedia and Hotels.com, both under Expedia Inc, steer people to more expensive products at random with a method called A/B testing. 

For example, one group of users in the study was shown an average hotel listing price of $187. Another group using the same search terms was shown prices that were $17 cheaper.

And travel discount site Priceline personalizes search results based on a user's history of clicks and purchases.

The researchers monitored the results of 300 real online users as well as creating hundreds fake profiles to reach their results.

As they explain in the paper, user personalization can be beneficial in many ways.

'For example, when a user searches on Google with an ambiguous query such as "apple," there are multiple potential interpretations,' reads the paper.

'By personalizing the search results (e.g., by taking the user's history of prior searches into account), Google is able to return results that are potentially more relevant (e.g., computer products, rather than orchards).'

But when these personalized results are such that they manipulate the user into spending more money, it falls in something of an ethical grey area.

Expedia spokesman Dave McNamee explained to the Wall Street Journal: 'Presenting different booking paths and options to different customers allows us to determine which features customers appreciate most. Pricing is not manipulated by Expedia.com.'

And Stephen Holmes, a spokesperson for Home Depot, said the findings are accurate but that the company is not 'intentionally steering search results'.

Lead researcher Christo Wilson admits that when it comes to online shopping, things do get complicated.

'In the real world, there are coupons and loyalty cards, and people are fine with that,' he said. 'Here, there's a transparency problem. The algorithms change regularly, so you don't know if other people are getting the same results.'
