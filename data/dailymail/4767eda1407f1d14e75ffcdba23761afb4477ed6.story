Polish parents who claim child benefit for their families in their home country should not receive the same amount as British workers, Nick Clegg said today.

The Deputy Prime Minister has ordered officials to find a legal way to slash the ‘absurd’ payments made for children who do not live in the UK.

He said it was not fair that Britain pays £80-a-month per child, but in Poland child benefit is worth only £18.

Nick Clegg wants Britain to stop paying UK rates for child benefit for children who live in countries where the rates are lower

Under EU rules, the benefit has to be paid to European nationals who are working in Britain and paying National Insurance – even if their families are based abroad.

There are around 24,000 families claiming for 38,500 children, with two-thirds of the children based in Poland.

David Cameron has said the payments are 'wrong' and vowed to scrap them altogether under wider EU reforms, which he admits will ‘take time’.

However, Mr Clegg believes Britain could act unilaterally now and cut the amount which is paid to match the child benefit rates in the countries where the children live.

Speaking on his LBC radio phone-in, Mr Clegg said: ‘There’s this thing about us paying child benefit to people who are working here but have got children elsewhere.

‘Obviously that’s absurd. I would like to deal with that overnight, but you have to wait for the treaties to change.

But in the meantime here’s an idea that might be worth exploring…. If there’s a Polish couple here or a Polish parent here and they are receiving child benefit, I think they should receive child benefit at the £18 per month which is the child benefit rate in Poland, not the £80 rate that we pay them here in the UK.

‘After all the child is in Poland. It saves a bit of money, but also symbolically it’s important.’

Two thirds of all child benefit sent abroad goes to pay for children in Poland, according to officials figures

Mr Clegg conceded that there will be ‘all sorts of legalities which might be difficult to straighten out’.

But he insisted: ‘It’s a fairer way of doing it. It’s one of the things that we should do… I am getting people to look at it and as ever you get reams and reams of paper saying it’s difficult.

‘Don’t worry I thump desks all the time and stamp feet, and I do so all the time.

‘Freedom to move was never, should never have been and mustn’t be freedom to claim. And that’s the big distinction we need to make.’

Child benefit in the UK is paid at £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for every other child.

Since last year families in the UK with one person earning more than £50,000 have had their child benefit cut, and removed altogether if one earner has a salary of more than £60,000.

Child benefit in some countries is more generous than the UK, worth around £115 per month in Belgium, £160 in Denmark and £155 in Germany.
