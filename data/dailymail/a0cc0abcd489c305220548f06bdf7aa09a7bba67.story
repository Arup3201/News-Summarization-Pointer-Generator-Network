Sir Dave Brailsford has admitted he omitted Sir Bradley Wiggins from Team Sky's Tour de France line up because of his fractured relationship with Chris Froome.

Brailsford faced some criticism for excluding Wiggins, particularly after Froome crashed out only a few days into the race.

Speaking at the Leaders in Sport conference at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday, Brailsford says he had to put the feelings of team leader Froome first, and felt the inclusion of Wiggins in the nine man team when they clearly loathe one another would be counter-productive.

Sir Bradley Wiggins was snubbed from this year's Tour de France line up

'You can have a nice popular team if you want but popularity doesn't always win,' said Brailsford in clear reference to the disappointment felt that Wiggins would not be riding the three English stages of this year's Tour.

'Forget Kevin Pietersen,' he said. 'I had a few of my own to deal with, and there are challenges.

'We had a tricky season with two big champions, big personalities - very driven.

'A number of times people said to me 'why don't you get Chris and Brad in a room, bang their heads together and tell them to get on with it'.

Chris Froome was preferred to Wiggins, but his bid for glory was ended by injury

'That would have been the easiest thing to do. But over three weeks in France you are travelling together in the morning, racing, then travelling after and eating together. It would have been like a Big Brother scenario.

'I had to ask myself if that was going to be optimal for the team in that environment. And the answer was no.

'Our best chance of winning the Tour lay in Chris's hands and I had to build the team around Chris.

'You get challenging scenarios; difficult decisions that can be fairly uncomfortable. But my analysis was, do we want to win?'

Sir Dave Brailsford has defended his decision to leave out Wiggins from the Team Sky squad

After a difficult year for Sky – that followed back-to-back wins at the Tour – Brailsford said he was considering ripping up the blueprint that has delivered so much success and starting again. 'I'm not trying to work out what a sports team in 2020 is going to look like,' he said.

He also said Wiggins would be targeting the iconic hour record in June. 'There is a plan for him to do it and I'm sure he can do it,' said Brailsford.

'When you look at the riders who could go for the hour record, and feasibly achieve a better distance than Jens Voigt's just achieved, then I think Bradley's probably one of the most accomplished.'
