Missing schoolgirl April Jones looks like a smiling angel in her favourite purple dress in a series of pictures showing her having fun last Christmas.

Her devastated family have released the photographs and say they still hope the five-year-old will return to meet Santa after going missing two months ago.

The child is still being hunted for by search teams after she disappeared when she went out to play in Machynlleth, mid-Wales on October 1.

Tragic: Missing schoolgirl April Jones stands in front of the tree last Christmas in her favourite purple dress

Mother Coral, 40, took to Facebook to post a poignant message to her 'baby April' as they prepare for their first Christmas without her.

'We just want you home for Christmas,' she wrote.

'It's so hard, you not here, running around asking how long before Father Christmas is coming.

'And you trying to open your presents and trying and to help us wrap presents for family and friends.

'Please come home.'

April, who is pictured proudly standing in front of the decorated tree at her family's home in Powys.

The other poignant images show her having fun in Hello Kitty ride, waving a flag sweetly, cuddling a toy and walking through a wood.

Sadly she vanished from near her home on October 1 while playing outside on her bike.

Mark Bridger, 46, has been charged with April's murder. He is also charged with child abduction and perverting the course of justice. He is due to appear at Caernarfon Crown Court on January 11 for a plea hearing.

Her disappearance sparked one of the largest police searches in UK history and those involved will take a fortnight's break to be with their families over Christmas before returning to the hunt.

April's family have asked well wishers to decorate their trees with a tribute for the missing school girl.

A family spokesman added: 'We would like to request that everyone puts a pink Christmas bauble on their tree for April.

'The Police are still searching and will be up to Christmas - they will then begin again in the New Year.

'We have dog handlers involved and new search teams come in every weekend.

'I hope this reassures you all as we are reassured by the Police teams involved in this investigation.'

The villagers of Machynlleth are trying to enjoy Christmas despite knowing that April is still missing.

And amongst the town centre's festive decorates there is a giant pink star in memory of the missing five-year-old.

Councillor Glenda Jenkins said: 'The town would like to make the Christmas run-up as normal as possible under the circumstances.

'The children are sensitive to what's going on, but it's the best people can hope for.

'Some of the Christmas celebrations will be going ahead, as long as it's done with some sensitivity.

'With young children it's very difficult because there's only so much information you can give them.

'They are hoping things will go ahead as normally as can be.'

The town's mayor also used his annual Christmas address to pay tribute to the inner strength of locals.

Councillor Gareth Jones said: 'The disappearance of April Jones shattered everybody in our community without exception.

'But somehow Machynlleth people found an inner strength and instead of rolling over and giving up we all grew a few feet taller.

'We stood up to the mark and bound together in a show of solidarity which became an example which the whole world witnessed and remains in awe of today.

'Each and every one of the residents of Machynlleth can be rightly proud of the contribution they have made to the reputation of their town, despite the most severe adversity.

'It is impossible to predict how events will unfold in the year ahead, just as nobody could have envisaged how 2012 would have turned out.

'The search for April Jones continues, she and her family are very much at the forefront of our minds and we live in hope.'

Messages of support for April's family continue to flood in on Facebook yesterday.
