Ten new beach huts have sold in just two days despite being positioned next to cabins that were destroyed in the winter storms.

The 8ft by 7ft timber huts in Christchurch, Dorset, were sold for £24,000 each - more than a quarter of a million pounds combined.

The buildings at Gundimore Beach are 200 yards away from where 50 of 120 identical huts on Avon Beach were obliterated in a Valentine's Day storm.

Sold: The 8ft by 7ft timber huts in Christchurch, Dorset, were snapped up for £24,000 each - more than a quarter of a million pounds combined

Washed away: A scene of devastation after the storm on Valentine's Day two months ago, which washed away 50 out of 120 huts on the same stretch of beach

Put up: The desirable buildings have been erected at Gundimore Beach, close to where 50 out of 120 identical huts were obliterated in a storm on Valentine's Day

Taking a look: Surprisingly, the new cabins have been built in front of the seawall, meaning there is nothing to protect them against the elements

Popular: Despite the possibility of being damaged in the future, there was no shortage of buyers willing to fork out thousands of pounds for them

Delivery: A spokesman for Christchurch Council said the beach huts have 'obviously proved to be a very desirable property in a unique location'

Like hot cakes: The council was expecting interest in the huts, but a spokesman said it 'couldn't have guessed that they would go so quickly'

Surprisingly, the new cabins have been built in front of the seawall, meaning there is nothing to protect them against the elements.

Despite the possibility of being damaged in the future, there was no shortage of buyers willing to fork out thousands of pounds for them.

Neil Farmer, a spokesman for Christchurch Council, said: ‘The beach huts have obviously proved to be a very desirable property in a unique location.

‘We thought that there would be interest in the huts but couldn't have guessed that they would go so quickly.

‘Given that the damage to huts was very localised and was caused by such unprecedented and extreme conditions, the council decided to go ahead.’

Listed for sale: The beach huts are located on Gundimore Beach, which sits in the Mudeford area of Christchurch, Dorset, east of Bournemouth

Examining the new arrivals: The council said it was 'advisable' for owners to take out insurance on the huts - which have direct access to the beach - and their contents

'It beggars belief': One local resident said that if the beach huts had been built two months ago, then 'they wouldn't be there now'

Opinion: One resident said: 'Where have they been living the last two months? You have only got to look at the destruction and it's obvious'

Extra costs: The new beach huts owners will also have to pay annual licence fees of £617 to the council

Location: The beach huts are located on Gundimore Beach, which is only 200 yards south-west of where 50 huts were washed away on Avon Beach (top right)

insurance on the huts - which have direct access to the beach - and their
contents.

But their location was branded 'ludicrous' by local resident Bob Hutchings.

He said: ‘Had they built them two months ago they wouldn't be there now. Putting beach huts nearer the sea just beggars belief.’

Another
 local, Keith Williamson, said: ‘Where have they been living the last 
two months? You have only got to look at the destruction and it's 
obvious.’

The new beach hut owners will also have to pay annual licence fees of £617 to the council.

February storm: Dozens of beach huts were destroyed in the bad weather earlier this year as Britain was battered by high winds

Huge operation: Soldiers from B Squadron Royal Wessex Yeomanry help clear up Avon Beach in Dorset in February after the storm left a trail of destruction

Lifted: A huge clear-up operation along the south coast's beaches was required in February after the Valentine's Day storm left a £3million trail of damage

Taken away: The hurricane-force winds that whipped up 30ft waves destroyed hundreds of wooden beach huts on the south coast, including 50 on Avon Beach

Powerful beach On Avon Beach at Christchurch, 50 sought-after chalets were obliterated by the February storms

Working hard: The Army and scores of volunteers were on scene helping to clear away tons of timber strewn across the beach and promenade

To me, to you: Soldiers from B Squadron Royal Wessex Yeomanry work with local volunteers to clean up the beach in February
