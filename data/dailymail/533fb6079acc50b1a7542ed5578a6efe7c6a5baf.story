A Taliban war lord has told how Prince Harry
was the prime target for fanatical fighters while he was serving in
Afghanistan, including a number of plots to either kill or kidnap him.

The startling revelations emerged today as
Prince Harry was surrounded by heavy security in Sydney, where he is
representing the Queen at a review of naval ships on Sydney harbor.

As the fourth in line to the throne remained
under heavy protection - including police commandos in rubber dinghies as
standard procedure  - alarming claims were made that Prince Harry was a
constant target for Taliban fighters while he was serving in Afghanistan.

The Taliban insurgent, Qari Nasrullah,
made it clear that Prince Harry was not looked upon as the son of the Queen of
England.

Prince Harry was the target of Taliban forces while serving in Afghanistan, it has been claimed. In Sydney today, the prince was met by Vice Admiral Ray Griggs, Chief of Navy, before embarking on the HMAS Leeuwin as they attend the 2013 International Fleet Review

Taliban member Qari Bashir has claimed Prince Harry was a prime target in a new interview

'As far as the Mujahideen were concerned, he
was just an ordinary soldier who was fighting for America,' Nasrullah told The Daily Mirror in a secret interview in Pakistan.

'This is how we view
him.

'He may well be a Prince in Britain, but to us he is merely a common soldier.

'There were many plans to capture him but - maybe it was his good luck -
he managed to escape.'

During his first tour as an infantryman
Prince Harry had to be recalled for his own safety when it was leaked that
he was serving in Afghanistan.

He completed his second tour as part of 662
Squadro, 3 Regiment, Army Air Corps at the end of last year.

He had been in Afghanistan for just a few days
before the main UK base Camp Bastian was attacked by suicide bombers.

Ground
forces charged at the desert perimeter, firing rock-propelled grenades and
Soviet-make AK47 assault rifles.

Although it is believed Harry was off duty at
the time, the battle continued for four hours resulting in the deaths of two US
servicemen and the destruction of several planes and helicopters.

Nasrullah, his face covered by a scarf, asked
in the secret Mirror interview why the British people did not take notice of
the suffering of children in Kunar province as a result of NATO air strikes.

And he wondered why many marriage ceremonies were bombarded.

While the new revelations that the Taliban had planned
to kill or kidnap Prince Harry would not have reached the ears of security
officials responsible for the royal visitor's safety in Australia before he
began his official duties today, no chances were being taken in any case.

Members of the Royal family remain a constant
target for fanatics of all types and they remain under guard whenever they are
out in public.

When Prince Harry began his duties - inspecting
an international fleet of warships joining in the celebrations for the Australian
navy's 100th birthday - armed plain clothes police and security experts mingled
with the thousands who had gathered around Sydney harbour's foreshores.
