A lifelong baseball fan was blinded after he was smashed in the face by a foul ball when he took his eyes off the field to pay attention to a park employee.

Keith Rawlins, 46, was in the stands on July 20 with his 15-year-old daughter after the pair decided to catch the Cleveland Indians play the Baltimore Orioles at Progressive Park, Ohio.

As the end of the game drew near, their section of the crowd was asked to leave the field early because of an event.

Blinded: Mr Rawlins has lost sight in his left eye after being hit in the face with a foul ball at a Cleveland Indians game in Ohio. He underwent ten hours of surgery and was left with medical bills of $56,000

Mr Rawlins said he remembered hearing the ball hit the bat and then a blinding pain.

He told ABC13: 'My face exploded. I knew what happened instantly. I knew I had been hit by a foul ball,” he said.

'It was arguably the only ball I’ve taken my eyes off of in 50,000 in the last 15 years.'

The baseball fan fell unconscious in the ambulance and needed ten hours of surgery to reconstruct his fractured eye socket, nose and sinus. He may have permanently lost sight in his left eye.

His medical bills have now reached $54,000. However because he was at the start of a new job as a machinist, Mr Rawlins is unsure if his health insurance will cover the extent of his injuries.

He also said that he can no longer work in his profession of the past 29 years because of the damage to his left eye.

Although he has had calls from the Cleveland Indians, they have not offered to contribute to his medical bills and instead offered him a baseball fan pack.

The Cleveland Indians did not return calls to the MailOnline today.

The team, which has an estimated worth of $410million according to Forbes, says it is not liable for fan injuries.

However Mr Rawlins said that the stadium staff put him in a position where he had to take his eye off the ball.

He has said that he hoped that the team would support him and get his family back on their feet. He is considering bringing a lawsuit against the Cleveland team.

The baseball fan has set up a Facebook page, Make MLB Safe For Fans, to warn others of the dangers of foul balls and to encourage Major League baseball teams to use nets similar to those that protect fans at hockey games.
