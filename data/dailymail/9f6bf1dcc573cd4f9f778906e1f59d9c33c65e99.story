This amazing Egyptian eco-hotel, which looks like it rises up out of the desert, has no electricity and bans mobile phones outside the bedrooms.

Rooms at the stunning Adrère Amellal, which start from £460 a night, are made from materials like salt-rock and palm for the roof. 

The thick, earthen walls absorb the heat of the sun during day, maintaining a cool interior at the 40-suite hotel. At night, when the temperature drops, the walls radiate the heat captured from the scorching sun.

Torches, beeswax candles and stars help illuminate the completely electricity-free 40-room resort.

Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have both been guests at the hotel near Siwa, staying in the £1,420-a-night Royal Desert Romm, which boasts the only bathtub at the property - installed especially for the couple.   

The earthen buildings are designed to blend in with the surrounding desert, along with the olive and palm groves and the relaxing slow-bubbling Roman springs.

A spokesman for the hotel said: 'All our furniture and accessories pay tribute to the talented artisanship of the Siwan people.'  

Adrère Amellal sits only 16km away from Siwa, an ancient city famed as the location of the Oracle of Amon, who was consulted by Alexander the Great before he continued with his Persian conquest. 

The city is surrounded by seven stunning salt lakes, the largest being Al Zaytun, which is 25km long. 

A wondrous mirage: The incredible Adrère Amellal resort in Siwa is made entirely out of salt rock and looks like it's rising out of the desert. The resort is close to Siwa, an ancient city near the Libyan border and overlooks Siwa Lake

Lit up by stars: The hotel is completely electricity-free and relies on starlight, torches and beeswax candles for light.  Made of kershef (a mixture of salt rock and mud) the thick earthen walls absorb heat in the day and radiate warmth at night

Romantic lighting: Lanterns illuminate the stairways to the rooms (left) and candles brighten the indoor dining area (right). Guests can also opt to have dinner outdoors

Wander around the resort and discover  open courtyards and roof terraces which can be converted into private dining rooms. Dine under the stars or request for candles to illuminate the table

An oasis of calm: The Berber-style hotel is part of a local sustainable development plan. The hotel roofs are supported by felled palm trees. All other wood used in the hotel is taken from the yearly trimming of surrounding olive trees

Cool and airy rooms: Sleep on crisp cotton sheets or recline on the locally-made furniture, created using traditional methods by artisans around the area

Stunning: The 40-room resort faces the Siwa Lake (left) and has a natural spring fed-pool. Enjoy traditional delicacies (right) in one of the many dining areas

Classy: Most of the food served comes from the hotel's organic farm and almost everything is home-made. There isn't a menu for lunch or dinner but individual dislikes are taken into consideration when food is being prepared 

Visitors can relax under the shade of palm trees by the natural spring-fed pool (right) or just lounge on the comfortable floor cushions in their rooms 

Communal area: Gaze across Siwa Lake and while away the afternoon in silent contemplation or grab a book from the resort's library, conveniently located by the lake
