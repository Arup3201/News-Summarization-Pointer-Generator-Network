Liam Holohan, 22, from Chatham, Kent, bought emergency flashing lights and ambulance stickers so he could pretend to be a paramedic

A fantasist who dreamed about being a paramedic fitted emergency lights onto his car and put a 'First Response' sticker onto the bonnet so he could drive through 30mph zones at 70mph.

Liam Holohan, 22, from Chatham, Kent, even bought a paramedic's uniform from the internet, as well as an 'ambulance officer' sticker for the back window of his makeshift ambulance.

He was only caught when police spotted his Suzuki Vitara driving at 70mph through Maidstone town centre.

Maidstone Crown Court heard the officer who spotted Holohan 
recognised the Suzuki was 
not a ‘normal response car’ for a paramedic.

The court heard how Holohan - who also bought medical equipment for his vehicle - was 
followed by police and ordered to the side of the road, but sped up and zoomed 
off.

He almost crashed on a series of corners as police chased him, the court was told.

Holohan
 drove ‘at speeds of up to 70mph’ in a 30mph zone for four miles before 
ditching his car and running off, but was soon tracked down by police.

When he was arrested, he told police he was a registered paramedic and was on his way home from work.

He claimed he owned a firm that was 
sub-contracted to the NHS to provide emergency response and that he had 
been trained to drive in ‘emergency response conditions’.

He lies collapsed, however, and he eventually admitted being a delivery driver.

The court heard how Holohan had even pretended
 to his family that he was a trained paramedic in a bid to ‘impress 
them’ and had bought a paramedic's outfit, emergency lights, medical gear
 and car stickers on the internet.

Maidstone Crown Court heard how Holohan had also fitted emergency blue and red flashing lights to the top of his car.

When he was caught by police, Holohan, pictured driving another car, said he was sub-contracted to the 
NHS to provide emergency response and had been trained to drive in those
 condition.  

Holohan admitted dangerous driving and 
having no insurance. He was banned from the road for 18 months and 
ordered to retake his driving test.

He was also given a one-year community order and ordered to do 100 hours of unpaid work.

Judge Jeremy Carey told Holohan: 'This is quite extraordinary behaviour, and there appears to be nothing that makes it explicable.

Holohan dressed his Suzuki Vitara in emergency flashing 
lights, and stickers saying 'First Response' and 'Ambulance Driver'. He
 also bought a paramedic's uniform from the internet (file pic)

'Your fantasy of being a paramedic is a 
concern. I hope unpaid work will give you a long time to reflect on your
 stupid and serious offending.'

Holohan claims on his Facebook page that he studied ‘Paramedic Science at Medway NHS’.

Writing after being sentenced last week, Holohan said on Facebook: 'Come on everyone have a go - yes I done wrong but every one makes mistakes in there (sic) life.'
