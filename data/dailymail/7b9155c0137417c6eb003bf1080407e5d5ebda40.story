A Labour MP threatened to punch Michael Gove after claiming the Education Secretary hurled a ‘Nazi’ jibe at him in angry scenes after the Commons vote on Syria.

Labour MP Dai Havard said that Mr Gove, one of David Cameron’s closest Cabinet allies, called him a ‘National Socialist,’ the original title of Hitler’s Nazi party.

Burly Welsh ex-union leader Mr Havard, known as ‘Dai Hard’ to colleagues, complained to Labour Whips and told them: ‘Michael Gove just called me a National Socialist. Tell him if he does it again I’ll deck him.’

'National Socialist': Michael Gove used the term in a row with Labour MP Dai Harvard, but sources close to the Tory Education Secretary said he was referring to Syrian President Bashar Assad, and not the Welsh MP

Sources close to Mr Gove – who wanted Britain to take military action against the Syrian regime – confirmed he used the term ‘National Socialist’ in the confrontation with Mr Havard after the 10.30pm vote on Thursday.

And they said Mr Gove also told him: ‘You will have to live with this on your conscience.’

But they insisted the Cabinet Minister was referring to Syrian president Bashar Assad as a ‘National Socialist’ and was not comparing Mr Havard to the Nazis.

Mr Gove’s friends said he had nothing to apologise for. ‘He was telling the truth,’ said one.

But sources close to Mr Havard hit back. ‘Gove lost his rag,’ said one. ‘Everyone knows “National Socialists” means Nazis. It was meant as an insult and Dai was right to be outraged.’

'If he does it again I¿ll deck him': Labour MP 'Dai Hard' Harvard was furious at the Nazi jibe he feels Mr Gove was directing at him

Tory MP Gavin Barwell, Parliamentary aide to Mr Gove, witnessed the row. He said last night: ‘We were filing out of the debating chamber just after the Syria vote and Michael was very upset.

‘He told Labour MPs, including Dai Havard, they were a disgrace and were giving succour to Assad, who was a National Socialist. Dai said “What did you just say to me?” He was very cross and said, “Say that again and I’ll thump you.”

‘But it was a misunderstanding. Michael was calling Assad a National Socialist. Dai was still angry later on when I talked to him in the Members’ Smoking Room to try to sort it out. We ended up having a civilised conversation about whether or not Assad was a National Socialist.’

It was not the only bad-tempered exchange involving Mr Gove.

He told Labour Defence spokesman Jim Murphy: ‘You are appeasing Assad.’

Glaswegian Mr Murphy shouted back: ‘F*** off you bully. You’re angry because you lost.’

The ‘appeasement’ jibe also has toxic echoes of Hitler. It was the damning charge levelled at those who tried to do a deal with the Nazi leader in an attempt to avoid war.

Mr Cameron was also involved in heated exchanges with Labour leader Ed Miliband, accusing him of political treachery and ratting on a pledge to support him over air strikes against Syria.

On the eve of Thursday’s Commons vote, when Mr Miliband told the Prime Minister he would not back him, Mr Cameron accused him of betraying America and siding with Assad’s Russian allies.

‘You are going against our greatest ally and siding with Lavrov!’ shouted Mr Cameron, referring to Russian Defence Minister Sergei Lavrov.

Mr Miliband said: ‘This is getting us nowhere’ – and slammed the phone down.

Shortly after the Commons defeat inflicted by Labour MPs and Tory rebels, a seething Mr Cameron told a colleague: ‘I understand those who voted against me for sincere reasons of principle, but Miliband is just playing politics. He put his party before his country.’

A source close to Mr Cameron said: ‘Miliband’s behaviour was disgusting. He ignored the interests of his nation to score a cheap party political success.’

'You've put your party before your country: Prime Minister David Cameron, left, accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of ignoring British interests to score a 'cheap' political point by opposing attacks on Syria

Miner’s son Mr Havard, 63, is proud of his radical Welsh roots, claiming he is ‘independent enough to fight a corner when needs be’.

In 2006, he denounced Prime Minister Tony Blair for his ‘misdirected obsession’ with backing George Bush’s foreign policy, and called for a ceasefire in the Middle East. 

The Merthyr Tydfil MP lost his job as Commons Defence Committee vice chairman amid claims that he had insulted a senior Falklands Islands official during a parliamentary trip to mark the 30th anniversary of the Argentine invasion. Keen horseman Mr Havard was said to be upset when plans for him to go riding on the island were scrapped.

The Left-winger, who spent 20 years as a union official before entering the Commons in 2001, also hit trouble last year when it was revealed he had lodged a 45p expenses claim for the mileage costs of attending an Remembrance Day service a mile from his home.

President Assad’s party is the Syrian-led branch of the Socialist Ba’ath Party, which has ruled Syria since 1963. The Ba’ath Party, which was also the ruling party in Iraq under Saddam Hussein, wants a single Arab socialist nation.

National Socialism, which translates as ‘Nationalsozialismus’ in German, is more generally associated with the Nazis.

It has its roots in the 17th Century Prussian tradition of military discipline. Hitler used it to justify the Holocaust.

There are some parallels with Hitler: Assad runs a totalitarian state enforced by a slavishly loyal military and secret police who routinely torture, imprison and kill his political opponents.

And his father, President Hafez Assad, gave shelter in Syria to Nazi war criminals.
