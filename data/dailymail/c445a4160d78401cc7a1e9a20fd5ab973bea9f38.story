Meet the super fit mother of three who uses her children and a pram as exercise equipment so she doesn't have an excuse to skip a workout.

Kimberley Welman has become a fitness sensation after photos of her using her 18-month-old twins as weights in her Queensland backyard  went viral.

The 31-year-old, who regularly posts photos and videos of her quirky exercise regimes under the name Stay Strong Mummy, already has more than 40,000 social media followers.

But Ms Welman says it all started by accident when her children - a three-year-old daughter and 18-month old twins - started climbing all over her when she tried to exercise.

'I would set them up for some activities outside, but of course they just wanted to jump around and on top of me,' she told Today.

'I figured, well, if this is what they want to do, then so be it. So while I was doing dips, I'd sit one of them on my lap. While I was doing some abs, they'd sit on my tummy. When I did bear crawls, they'd hop on my back.'

Since then they've been exercising as a group and Ms Welman documents their workouts and nutritional meals to inspire other mothers to keep fit.

The stay-at-home mum regularly tells her followers she isn't a nutritionist or personal trainer and admits everything she writes or posts is based on her own experiences. 

Ms Welman mainly sticks to squats, lunges, planks, push-ups and burpees when she works out with her children. She also regularly does yoga and meditates. 

'It's funny, I generally just do my workouts and the kids find a way of joining in on their own,' she said. 

'I don't think you can go wrong by being outside, in the fresh air, moving your body and interacting with your kids at the same time.'

Ms Welman says she has been able to connect with like-minded mums since she started documenting her life at home with her children on social media. 

'Being a stay at home mummy, it's easy to feel isolated and lonely at times,' she wrote on her blog.

'The bulk of my time is spent at home. I get my kids out of the house every morning for a fun activity, but it's tricky for me to go to certain places that aren't 'twin friendly'. 

'So the majority of my day, between feeding, playing, chores and sleeping is spent at home.'

Ms Welman recommends other mothers to seek out professional advice to learn basic exercises and then improvise with the children at home.
