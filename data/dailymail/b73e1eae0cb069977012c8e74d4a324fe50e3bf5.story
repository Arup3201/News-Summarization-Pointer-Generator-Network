The FA, faced with the new Wembley attracting its lowest crowd for an England international, have further antagonised the hardcore support base. 

Indeed, some fans who have bought tickets for Wednesday’s low-key friendly against Norway to secure loyalty points for Euro 2016 are threatening not to go to the match.

This makes it even more likely the attendance will be significantly less than the 48,876 who watched a friendly against Sweden in 2011.

Loyal fans, who watch the national team home and away, are annoyed that they have to buy seats for three Euro 2016 qualifiers at Wembley by Monday to qualify for their England Supporters Club £5 discount off the price of a home ticket. And the match against Lithuania is not being played until March 2015.

This follows the FA offering members a £5 discount for the Norway game, only to drop the price to the general public by £10.

The supporters club were already aggrieved by the FA moving double loyalty points from away match attendance to Wembley games to help fill the stadium during an ultra-dull Euro qualifying campaign. 

Fans spokesman Kevin Miles said: ‘The FA should be really careful at taking members club support for granted. The over-riding desire to fill Wembley cannot come at any cost.’

The FA insisted after a World Cup build-up during which Roy Hodgson’s England side spent just two full days at their £100million St George’s Park national training centre — isolated in the Staffordshire countryside near Burton — that it will be fully utilised by the senior team in future. 

So where are England going to stay before Wednesday’s friendly against Norway? The Grove Hotel outside Watford, which is a lot handier for Wembley.

It is highly unlikely following the text exchange scandal that Labour leader Ed Miliband will have former Cardiff manager Malky Mackay as his personal guest again at the House of Commons anytime soon. 

Mackay was invited to watch PM’s questions earlier this year by Miliband, who attended a Westminster reception for Mackay and backroom staff after Cardiff won promotion to the Premier League in 2013.

An unprecedented meeting of UEFA’s 54 national federations in Monaco on Thursday morning will decide how strongly president Michel Platini attacks FIFA later in the day. 

The powerbrokers have been called to the Principality for a summit with no agenda apart from the UEFA supremo outlining his ambitions around standing against Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency in 2015.

Platini is not expected to put himself forward, preferring to remain Europe’s football kingpin. So UEFA representatives, having been summoned to Europe’s most expensive location, will at least expect a full-on assault against FIFA’s dysfunctional governance when Platini speaks to the Press afterwards. 

This would follow on from the strong anti-Blatter mood — not least from the FA — within UEFA at the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo before the World Cup. Platini wants to make a landmark statement, but it is understood his advisors are urging caution.

Balding blow for C4

Clare Balding indicating she is unlikely to renew her £400,000-a-year contract to present 40 days of Channel 4 racing in 2015 really is the death knell for its doomed revamped racing coverage — a spectacular failure since the start of 2013. 

Having Balding on board was one of the main reasons why IMG were originally awarded the production contract. And her jumping ship from presenting her specialist sport is the clearest sign that the racing programming has not worked. 

Racing is lucky to have two specialist channels screening its meetings, so only the marquee occasions should be sold separately in future. And certainly Royal Ascot would love to be back on BBC.

No sooner had Kevin Pietersen failed for Surrey on T20 finals day than he was responding to tweets from Graeme Smith that suggest the cricket mercenary will play in South Africa’s Ram Slam T20 tournament in November. 

Not that KP is delivering value for money, scoring just one half century in 25 T20 innings for Delhi Daredevils, Surrey and St Lucia Zouks this year.
