Burglar Max Bancroft, from Lancashire, was tracked down by police after he accidentally left behind his shirt and a letter at the scene of the crime with his name and address on it

A burglar was tracked down by police after he accidentally left behind his shirt and a letter at the scene of the crime with his name and address on it.

Teacher's son Max Bancroft, 21, had smashed into his local pub after earlier being thrown out for drunkenness - only to injure himself on the broken glass of a window.

As he pulled off his T shirt to to stem the flow of blood, a letter he had received in the post fell out of his pocket and landed on the floor.

Police found the incriminating 
blood-stained note and T-shirt as they hunted for clues following the 
burglary at The George and Dragon in the village of Barrowford, 
Lancashire.

Officers went to arrest Bancroft at 
his home and found his fridge full of cooked meat stolen on the same 
night from a grocery store.

At Burnley Crown Court, Bancroft admitted two charges of burglary and was jailed for two years.

The judge Mr Recorder William Smith 
told him: 'The stupidity of the offence is highlighted by the fact you 
left a blood-stained shirt and your calling card in the form of an 
envelope with your name and address on.

'Together with the blood on the carpet, that identified you clearly as being the perpetrator of this burglary.'

The court heard Bancroft carried out 
the raids just four months after he was given a suspended jail term for 
two other burglaries.

Last December 15, at 9am, the landlady of The George and Dragon found a window to her private accommodation had been smashed after an intruder had climbed onto a roof and taken a slate.

Nothing had been stolen but the landlady found the T-shirt and the blood-stained letter with Bancroft's personal details on it at the back of the pub.

Prosecutor Miss Emma Kehoe said: 'Blood was also found on a carpet in the bedroom and it was that that identified the defendant as the offender.'

Inquiries revealed he went on to break into the grocery shop on the same night using a brick to smash the window and stole a charity collection box, a meat pie and four kilos of ham. Bancroft later claimed he could not recall either burglary.

In mitigation his lawyer Nick Dearing said: 'Both burglaries demonstrate a level of incompetence which showed there was no sophistication at all. He made shambolic attempts to gain entry.'

Mr Dearing added: 'He is an intelligent young man who is a fool to find himself in court. It seemed all his offences were committed either after alcohol was consumed or to acquire alcohol.

'He had no recollection of the offences at all and couldn't say whether he had or had not committed then. When presented with the forensic evidence, he conceded he must have committed them.'

Mr Dearing said Bancroft, who came from a 'decent family background', presented himself as deeply immature, rather then an entrenched criminal.

He added: 'He is terrified of the prospect of a custodial sentence. This will be his first time in custody.'
