On the run: Dangerous armed robber David Blood has walked out of Ford Open Prison  - the second time he has gone on the run in two years

An open prison has a staggering  90 inmates on the run, it emerged last night.

They include at least one murderer, burglars, firearms criminals and  fraudsters – some of whom absconded from jail years ago.

The revelations about HMP Ford in West Sussex will intensify the row over whether the wrong convicts are being sent to open conditions to ease pressure on Britain’s packed jails.

Local Tory MP Nick Gibb and the Prison Officers Association said mistakes were being made because of ‘constraints’ in the prison service.

Mr Gibb warned: ‘The risk assessment of prisoners who are being sent to Ford open prison is clearly not vigorous enough.

‘I sense that because of the constraints on capacity in the prison service that mistakes are being made in that assessment process.’

Steve Gillan, general secretary of the POA, said his members were noticing ‘time and time again’ that the wrong sorts of prisoners are being placed in open conditions.

He added: ‘There aren’t enough prison officers because of budget cuts, we’re too overcrowded, mistakes are being made, and I think people are being rushed through the system incorrectly.’

In a sign of a worsening overcrowding crisis, 40 prisons across England and Wales were instructed to raise their ‘operational capacity’.

This is a tactic used by prison bosses to create more space in the system by, for example, re-opening disused cells.

Earlier this week, the Daily Mail 
revealed how Sussex Police, which released the latest figures about HMP 
Ford, had taken four years to tell the public a savage murderer had gone
 missing from the prison.

Robert
 Donovan – whose fatal stabbing of a West End theatre manager shocked 
the country in the 1970s – walked out in June 2010, less than a year 
after being moved to open conditions.

But,
 despite police considering the killer too dangerous to approach, not a 
single appeal was made for help in catching the  57-year-old until this 
week.

Officers said they had decided to act only after deciding he was probably no longer hiding in Sussex.

Violent armed robber David Blood is the latest inmate to  go on the run from Ford  open prison after he absconded on Thursday.

The 48-year-old was serving a life sentence for a robbery on a post office in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, in 2000.

He is the 23rd convict to abscond from the prison since November last year.

Last month violent robber Simon Rhodes-Butler also absconded from Ford, but  was arrested in London yesterday morning.

Blood is 6ft1in, of small build with brown eyes and cropped black hair, and is thought to have links to Staffordshire  and Warwickshire.

PC Stephen Reed said: ‘Because of Blood’s record, we have to consider that he could pose a threat to  the public. I would urge  anyone that sees him to contact us on 999 rather than approaching him.’

Responding to the latest figures, they denied being too slow to act in identifying and tracing absconders.

Supt Lawrence Hobbs said the force made ‘some very quick and positive steps’ and had arrested 23 absconders in recent months.

Around
 23 people disappear from the prison each year. He said police did not 
routinely make media appeals to the public when prisoners went missing 
but considered each case individually, taking into account the risk.

He
 added the vast majority were serving jail terms for offences such as 
fraud, dishonesty and theft, telling the BBC: ‘We are absolutely 
confident the risk to the public remains low.’

In
 November, the force found there was a number of people who had 
absconded whose cases had not been regularly reviewed, and a dedicated 
team was set up to review each case.

A
 spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: ‘The Justice Secretary has 
been clear that keeping the public safe is our priority and has ordered 
immediate and major changes to tighten up temporary release processes 
and open  prison eligibility.’  

He
 added that abscondments had reached record lows under this Government 
and were down 80 per cent over the past ten years, and insisted every 
incident was taken seriously, with police contacted as a matter of 
urgency.

Controversy has 
been raging for two months over convicts absconding from open jails. It 
was sparked by the disappearance of an armed robber known as the Skull 
Cracker.

Michael Wheatley, 55, walked out of a Kent jail last month, holding up a building society in Surrey before being caught.

Killers and other violent criminals have been able to walk out of jail in recent months.

In almost every case police warned the public these men should not be approached.

Murderer David Richards, 53, walked out of prison and went on the run for nine years – even claiming benefits, obtaining a passport and going abroad on holiday.

The disappearance of the Hell’s Angel should have triggered a  manhunt after he absconded from a Derbyshire open prison in 2005.

But local police refused to look for him, leaving him free to reinvent himself as a respectable member of society.

The habitual armed robber dubbed the Skull Cracker robbed a building society of almost £20,000 while on the run from open prison.

Michael Wheatley, 55, was handed his 14th life sentence last month- but could be out again in ten years.

He admitted holding up the Chelsea Building Society in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, four days after absconding from an open prison in Kent. 

He was already serving 13 life sentences at the time, and failed to return from day release on May 3.

Police also took four years to warn the public that a dangerous murderer was on 
the run from an open prison.

Police have no idea where he is: Murderer Robert Donovan (above) has been on the run since fleeing an open prison four years ago

Robert Donovan, who was convicted of stabbing a West End theatre manager to death, walked out of Ford prison in June 2010.

Police
 considered him so dangerous that he should not be approached by the 
public, but not a single appeal was made for help catching him until 
yesterday.

Donovan, 57, had 
been in open conditions for less than a year when he absconded from the 
prison near Arundel, West Sussex.

Officers said they had decided to act 
only after concluding he was probably no longer in the county.

Tory
 MP Philip Davies, who has campaigned for tighter rules on open prisons,
 said: ‘It is quite extraordinary that this is only just coming to light
 now. The public should have been informed straight away.

‘People
 need to know for their own safety. If the authorities had to make an 
announcement every time somebody absconded, I suspect a much more robust
 system would soon be put in place.’

Donovan
 was jailed indefinitely at the Old Bailey in December 1974 for a crime 
that shocked the nation.

The sentence – in this case, the juvenile 
equivalent of a life term – meant he would be detained until the prison 
authorities decided it was safe to release him.
