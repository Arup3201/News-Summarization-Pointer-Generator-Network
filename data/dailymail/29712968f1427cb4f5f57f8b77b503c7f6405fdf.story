Checklist: Leon Reid told police he had never had to force entry into a home

Get a dog and a shingled patio – a serial burglar has drawn up a checklist revealing his top tips to avoid a break in.

Police say Leon Reid has burgled at least 70 homes but never forced entry and was only caught out by DNA evidence.

Before Reid was jailed for five years on Wednesday at Woolwich Crown Court he handed over his checklist list to police on how not to be burgled.

The 32-year-old career criminal, who admitted one burglary and asked for 29 others to be taken into consideration, even told officers his list should be added to the Met’s crime prevention leaflets, The Daily Telegraph reports.

His list, which was written before he was sentenced, detailed the types of houses Reid, of New Cross, south London, avoids.

It states any sign of a dog would put most burglar's off as well as a pebbled or shingled drive, because of the crunching noise.

Lighting was also a major deterrent, including motion senor lighting.

Other top tips for homeowners include investing in anti-climb paint, getting some CCTV or an alarm box.

Jailed: Before Leon Reid was sentenced at Woolwich Crown Court on Wednesday he handed over a check-list of trade secrets to police

A dog or a sign warning of a dog: Burglars will not risk entry if there is even a 'hint of a pet pooch

Pebble drives or shingled patios: These make it difficult when approaching a house because of the noise

Alarms: Even if the alarm box is a fake, Reid told police he never raided a home with a burglar alarm box

CCTV: Reid said burglars avoided homes with cameras

Wire on gates and anti-climb paint: They make it difficult and 'messy' for burglars

Well-lit: Reid said if there were any lights on he avoided the home

Motion sensor lighting: Lights outside which could go one as soon as anyone walked by was a major deterrent for Reid

And Reid, who once had an ear bitten off by a police dog while fleeing a burglary near his home, would avoid a home even if he suspected the CCTV or alarm box was fake.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Paul Astbury, who is based in Lewisham, told The Telegraph:  
‘What is compelling about Reid’s offending is that during all of his 
70-plus offences dating back to 2006 he has never forced entry.

‘He entered through open windows and doors of premises that did not have one of his list of ‘deterrents’. It speaks volumes really.’

The force said it will use the information Reid has handed over to reinforce crime prevention tips to residents but did not comment on whether Reid’s list would be published.

Burglar victim Tom Ellis-Scott, 34, of Streatham, south London, who was burgled four years ago, told the paper: ‘It may seem like simple advice, but when it comes down to it this from the point of view of a crook so is worth heeding.’
