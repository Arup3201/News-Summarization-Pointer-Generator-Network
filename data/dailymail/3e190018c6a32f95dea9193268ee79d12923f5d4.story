The boss of a filthy Chinese takeaway where rats ran riot while staff smoked cigarettes in food preparation areas has been fined.

Shi Le Zhang, 42, who ran 88 Noodle Bar in Huddersfield, pleaded guilty to four breaches of food safety and hygiene regulations when he appeared at Kirklees Magistrates’ Court.

Magistrates heard how rat droppings were found in the takeaway and food preparation areas - which included the outside back yard - were filthy.

Shi Le Zhang, 42, pleaded guilty to four breaches of food safety and hygiene regulations when he appeared at Kirklees Magistrates' Court after the prosecution told how 88 Noodle Bar in Huddersfield had a rat infestation

The court was told that standards of the takeaway – which currently has a zero rating for hygiene - slipped after its chefs left the country for the Chinese New Year celebrations.

Miles Barker, prosecuting on behalf of Kirklees Council, said that the town centre premises had been known to the Environmental Health service since at least 2006.

He explained that the business had never scored more than a two out of five in the Food Standards Agency’s scores on doors ratings.

On the evening of January 29 the council’s officers went to the takeaway and found that food was being stored and prepared outside in the rear yard.

Mr Barker said: ‘It has a known rat infestation which is not uncommon in Huddersfield now due to the ageing of the properties.

‘The rats appear to thrive on access to rubbish from businesses around there.’

Investigators found that food was being prepared and stored in an outside yard to the rear of 88 Noodle Bar in Huddersfield (above), which is described as a 'prominent and popular' takeaway in the town centre area

Magistrates heard that part of this area was sectioned off with a wall, gates and a corrugated roof.

Mr Barker said: ‘It was clear that food was being stored and prepared there.

‘A metal table had a bucket of chopped pork and two buckets of vegetables.

‘There was food debris and peelings in a tray and fridge freezers and shelves.

‘There was evidence of rat activity outside and rat droppings were found in various locations.’

Mr Barker said that there was evidence of smoking in this area and it was an offence to smoke in a food preparation area.

There was also no hot water in the kitchen hand wash basin and dishcloths where food was being prepared were so dirty that they had to be thrown away.

Plastic boxes of cooked rice sat at 210C and large amounts of other food had been left out at room temperature, providing a breeding ground for bacteria.

The freezer was not running at the correct temperature and food including fried eggs were left uncovered on shelves.

Mr Barker added: ‘Raw meat was defrosting in washing up bowls not designated as raw meat only.

Due to his limited means magistrates ordered Zhang to pay £150 fine as well as £500 prosecution costs

‘Filters were missing from an extraction canopy so there was no way of removing moisture and grease from the air.

‘This attracts dirt and germs and also presents a fire safety hazard.

‘It wasn’t being cleaned frequently enough and the officers were very disappointed in what they found.’

Zhang, who said he is now just a chef at the takeaway, closed it down immediately and had it cleaned.

With the aid of a Mandarin interpreter, he told the court: ‘It was the Chinese New Year and some of the chefs went back to China.

‘Other part time staff tried to cover and for a month made a mess of it.’

Magistrates told him they were concerned about the public safety of the business, which they described as prominent and popular with students.

Due to his limited means they ordered him to pay a £150 fine as well as £500 prosecution costs.
