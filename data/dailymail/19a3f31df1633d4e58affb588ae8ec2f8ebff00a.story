Continental-style cafes selling wine by the glass, deli-foods and gourmet cheese are being opened in some Waitrose stores in new ‘grazing areas’.

The chain already offers coffee shops in competition to the big chains, but it is now looking to take on bars and restaurants by offering meals to ‘ladies who lunch’.

The first of the food outlets is at a new Waitrose in Keynsham, Somerset, which took the building from the Co-op earlier this year, while more are planned across the country.

No longer just a supermarket: Waitrose is trailing continental-style cafes where customers can sample wines and food on sale in the store

Another opened last week in a new store near Swindon, which is also trialling a fresh juice bar and a wine tasting area.

The grazing areas, which include benches and tables, are provided next to the deli and bakery areas to allow customers to try upmarket, gourmet products that are on sale around the store.

Customers can choose from platters serving ham, cheese and artichokes, together with a glass of wine for £7.50.

The move is part of a shift by the major supermarkets to transform big box stores into miniature high streets with a mix of other services in the hope of turning a shopping trip into an event rather than a chore.

Waitrose has had huge success in increasing the number of people visiting stores with its daily offer of a free coffee or tea to holders of its myWaitrose card, however it has upset some independent coffee shops.

The chain also has plans to double the number of conventional in-store cafes, serving hot food from lasagne to ham hock pie, taking the figure up to around 200.

It has also announced plans for 100 mini-gardening shops or pods outside stores this spring, selling grow your own vegetables as well as plants and other products.

Expanding: Customers will be able to enjoy a glass of wine and food platter when they do their weekly shop

Marks & Spencer already offers deli-style restaurants serving wine in some outlets, while Tesco has added Giraffe family restaurants, Harris + Hoole coffee shops and Euphorium bakers to some ‘Extra’ stores.

Tesco is also rumoured to be working on a high street takeaway food chain that would rival the likes of Pret a Manger.

Moira Howie, the Waitrose nutrition manager, said there is a big change in eating habits and lifestyles, with people moving away from sitting down to breakfast, lunch and dinner towards snacking.

Looking ahead, she said: ‘The idea of three square meals a day will give way to little-and-often grazing.

‘Consumers will monitor their own calorie intake and energy use through technology and specially designed apps. With an ageing population, smaller portions of nutrient-rich foods will be popular.’

The new continental style grazing areas selling wine are a major departure for the store, which was found in Acton, west London, in 1904 by Wallace Waite, Arthur Rose and David Taylor. The name Waitrose was adopted in 1908 after David Taylor left the business.

Growing: Waitrose already has around 200 conventional cafes selling hot drinks and food

The chain was taken over by the John Lewis partnership in 1937 when it had just ten stores and it has now grown to more than 300 including more than 30 smalller convenience stores.

Wine tasting is offered at Keynsham, Somerset, along with a food platter from the deli counter, which cost £5.95 each and include a selection of cheese, meats and bread. Adding a glass of wine takes the price up to £7.50.

Waitrose said the ‘grazing area’ concept is a trial and therefore the company is unable to say how many other outlets will introduce them.

Apart from grazing areas, it has also opened wine tasting areas at stores in Cambridge, Kingston and Kenysham.

Stores offering wine tasting charge £3.25 a glass from the store’s range, while Waitrose also allows customers to buy a bottle of wine at the normal retail price plus a corkage fee for drinking it on the premises of £7.40.

The firm’s managing director, Mark Price, is due to outline the next phase of the trials at the new Swindon store next month.

The company operates a wine and food bar in the food hall of John Lewis at the Bluewater shopping centre, however it is now planning to run similar outlets in Waitrose supermarkets for the first time.
