A cheeky Scottish red-head claims to have saved hundreds of pounds in the high street - thanks to his home-made 'ginger discount card'. 

Richard Macrae, 30, from Aberdeen, was given the fake card by a friend for his birthday and he has successfully used it in bars, restaurants, cinemas and even with taxi drivers.

The comic book illustrator claims to have saved more than £200 and said he is constantly asked by people how they can acquire one too.

The cheeky Scot tries his luck using the home-made 'ginger discount card' at a Burger King 

He told the Tab: 'People have always given me stick for my hair colour, but now I'm going out three nights a week and saving a fortune. The joke is on them.

'It comes out with me more than my bank card. My reputation precedes me and once I was asked by a security guard if I was the "ginger discount guy".

'I ask if they do the ginger discount, and when they look confused I slide across my card.

'Usually everyone gets the humour behind it, but some people look confused and wonder if it's real which is always a laugh, but most get the joke.

'I've saved a couple of hundred pounds maybe, with money off booze, taxis, food and club entries and over four years it fairly builds up.

'It opens folk up to a bit of banter back and forth but I never try for any specific amount of discount. Any money off is always handy.'

Mr Macrae said people often asked him how they could get hold of a 'ginger discount card' 

The thrifty red-head said he had received discounts on cinema tickets, drinks and taxi rides.

But he admits it has not all been plain sailing and he has suffered his share of setbacks. 

He said: 'I've been asked to leave a bar once because the bartender assumed that I was too drunk if I was attempting to use the card. 

'But usually the only places that have turned it down are places I've used it at before anyway.'  

Still, he says the card has proved popular with both gingers and non-gingers.

He said: 'Once they see it plenty of folk ask about getting one.

'It's not just ginger people. Anyone who has seen it work always asks for one, whether that is for a beard discount card, a popped collar discount card, the list goes on and on.'

Mr Macrae tries to use the card in a bar - he says he has saved more than £200 in the four years he has had it

Rik Gillespie, 30, a barman at the city's JamJar pub, said: 'I used to serve Richard and his friends regularly, as they were good customers and a great laugh.

'The first time I saw the ginger discount card I thought it was brilliant and gave him the same discount that we would for students just because it looked so real.'

Another to give Mr Macrae discount was barmaid Kirsty Davidson, 24, of Aberdeen's Illicit Still. 

She said: 'I thought it was really funny and unique as I had never seen anyone try use something like that before.

'I gave him 20 per cent food and drink discount as he was also in for food at the time.

'I decided it was all in good fun and he was a bit of a chancer.'
