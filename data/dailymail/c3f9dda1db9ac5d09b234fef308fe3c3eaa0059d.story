This is the dramatic moment a woman gave birth in a car as her boyfriend made a desperate attempt to drive her to the local hospital.

Diamond Jones and her boyfriend Corey Lynn Griffith were driving down the I-20 in Jackson, Mississippi towards Baptist Women's Clinic when she saw the baby's head emerge.

Jones said that she realized that her new daughter was not going to wait until they had reached hospital to make her entrance.

That's when proud dad Griffith took out his iPhone and captured the dramatic moment which unfolded at 5 am on September 8.

Jones told WLBT: ‘I think we had just passed the airport exit and I felt the head come out and I had to push.’

In the video, Griffith can be heard shouting words of encouragement to his unborn daughter: ‘Yea. Talk to me girl. We going to get you there. You just hold on.’

Griffith said: ‘I thought it was a false alarm and I reached over and sure enough, it was.

‘I hit the gas immediately, and she said one more push and here she is. She sat her on her knee and I said, ‘oh my goodness.’’

New mom: Diamond Jones said she felt the head come out and had to push then gave birth and recalls that she immediately inspected her baby to check that her umbilical cord was not wrapped around her neck

Love: Griffith said ‘They tell me I'll never love another person the way I love this girl and I know that truly’ 

The shocked mother can be seen holding her newborn baby who is wailing and crying loudly as her mother holds on to her tightly.

In the cell phone video, Griffith tries to comfort both his newborn daughter and his fiancé.

He tells Jones: ‘Rub her baby. Let her know you love her.’

Proud dad Griffith says that he had planned to tape the birth on his iPhone.

But he never imagined doing so in the car.

He said: ‘I had my phone in my hand because I had just called the nurse and thank God for the iPhone because you can just hit it and the camera is right there.’

Meanwhile Jones recalls that she inspected her baby after the birth to check that her umbilical cord was not wrapped around her neck.

‘I just wanted to make sure it wasn't tangled or wrapped around her and once I saw that and I was sitting her up, I figured we would be ok. We'll make it to the hospital and let them cut the cord. But that's the first thing we checked for was that she was not tangled.’

Griffith expressed his amazement  at how quickly his baby began to try new things.

He said: ‘She's already trying to nurse! Look at her. She's ready.’

The couple have named their bundle of joy Corri Lynn after her father.

And although she gave her parents the shock of their lives with her dramatic entry into the world, her proud mom and dad say they fell in love with her instantly.

‘They tell me I'll never love another person the way I love this girl and I know that truly,’ Griffith said.
