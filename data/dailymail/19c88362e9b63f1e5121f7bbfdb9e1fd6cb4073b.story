He was born with his left arm and most of his left lung missing.

As a child he insisted on doing everything himself, refusing to take the easy way out.

Now, as an adult, Luke Ericson is on a mission - to show other people born with disabilities and those facing a difficult road ahead, to persevere, never give up and 'be the best person they can be'.

The athlete has worked hard in the gym to build up his strength, taking up Crossfit and performing in global contests.

And his ability to do press ups, planks and pull-ups would put most able-bodied people to shame.

Now, to share his journey and to inspire others, he has created a series of videos showing his training.

Luke Ericson, from Hawaii, was born with his left arm and most of his left lung missing

He developed scoliosis and eight years ago doctors diagnosed him with type 1 diabetes 

But the adaptive athlete has never let it hold him back. He regularly hikes, rock climbs, swims, surfs, and performs in fitness contests

The inspiring footage shows Luke performing a workout in the gym, doing press-ups, pull-ups, dips and other exercises. 

In November he embarked on his latest project with his friend, videographer Andrew Rizer.

They set out to produce a new 10-minute film charting his preparation prior to the Wodapalooza Fitness Festival in Miami.

But to make their project a reality, the pair appealed for help.

The adaptive athlete, who lives in Hawaii, said on his Kickstarter page: 'I've seen the effect my story, and other adaptive athletes' stories can have on people's lives and attitudes.'It started off with one or two people, then at my first competition it was hundreds, and now thousands. 

'Everyday I get messages and letters about how my story has inspired and encouraged others to push through their own barriers and get their lives back on track.

'I get stopped by people at the gym who want to let me know that because they saw me, they were able to finish that last set, or didn't quit their workout early and go home.

'When I go hiking I get stopped for photos and handshakes by people who express how they are going to push aside their excuses because they saw me pushing aside mine.

'And, I'm constantly contacted by other physically disabled individuals who thought they were the only one.'

That, he said, is why he was inspired to make a documentary about his own experiences.

'That's why I keep pushing,' he added. 'For the people whose lives I can make even a small difference in, I do it for them.

'And the production of this video documentary will help me continue to do that.

'This video will reach hundreds of thousands of people with my story, and that of all adaptive athletes.'

Luke was born without his left arm, and half of his left lung was also missing.

Later he developed scoliosis and eight years ago doctors diagnosed him with type 1 diabetes.

'As a child I had always insisted on doing everything myself and never taking the easy way out,' he said.

'I've never seen any reason why I couldn't do something myself - swimming, surfing, rock climbing, or Crossfit.

'If I want something bad enough, I'll find a way to make it happen.' 

Luke has been training in the gym for years, but started doing Crossfit around two years ago.

He said embarking on the workouts forced him to modify them to suit his body.

In November, he embarked on a mission to produce a documentary to help inspire other adaptive athletes 

He and his videographer friend filmed Luke training ahead of the Wodapalooza Fitness Festival, a three-day event in Miami, as well as capturing footage of him performing at the event

He said he is inspired to film himself, to show others they can do anything. He said: 'That's why I keep pushing. For the people whose lives I can make even a small difference in, I do it for them'

'I had to do a lot of things differently,' he said. 'Scaling down the weights and modifying the movements so that I could do them all with one arm.

'In the last year I decided to stop putting limits on myself, and started to work towards working out at the same level as everyone else.

'I often get weird looks when I set down the dumb bell and walk over to the barbell to attempt a power clean, dead lift, or back squat.

'But, I never let those looks hold me back.' 

In November, Luke took part in the Working Wounded fitness Competition.

In the aftermath he experienced an outpouring of support, his photos and videos shared and liked on social media more than 300,000 times. 

He was invited to take part in the Wodapalooza Fitness Festival, a three-day event in Miami with more than 1,100 athletes from eight countries taking part.  

On January 4, his friend Andrew travelled to Hawaii to film him training for nine days.

They captured footage of Luke working out in his back yard, hiking, rock climbing, swimming, sailing and running.

Luke said his determination stems from his childhood, when he insisted on doing everything for himself'

He then travelled to Miami with Luke to film him competing in the contest, which ran from January 16 to 18. 

He said: 'I've never seen any reason why I couldn't do something myself - swimming, surfing, rock climbing, or Crossfit. If I want something bad enough, I'll find a way to make it happen'

Andrew, who first met Luke around a year ago, said: 'I immediately recognised his drive for life.' 

In another video, Luke added: 'It is your body, it is your life. 

'You only get one of each, one body and one life, you want to enjoy your time on this earth.

'Being healthy, feeling healthy, there is nothing better than that.

'There is lots of people, lots with different, whether it's physical disabilities or confidence issues and internal angst, that use it as an excuse for them not to do something, whether that be fitness or a job or a hobby that they love, or a relationship that they don't pursue.

'They let all these different fears stop them from doing something. Just don't. Don't let anything or anyone stop you from being happy.' 

With a goal of collecting $2,500 to fund their project, the pair were delighted to find their target was reached on January 19.
