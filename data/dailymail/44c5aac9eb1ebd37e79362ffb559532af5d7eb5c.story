They may be only a few hours old but these newborn pandas are already enjoying life in the spotlight as they wave to cameras.

Little Yuan Zai was born to born to giant panda Yuan Yuan at Taipei City Zoo, Taiwan last month.

A team of keepers have been working around the clock to take care of the female panda cub, who is being cared for in an incubator.

Their daily routine includes feeding the cub, taking her temperature after each meal, changing her bedding and keeping track of her weight, zoo official Chang Chi-hua said.

Yuan Yuan and her mate, Tuan Tuan, were gifted to Taiwan by China in late 2008 as a cross-Taiwan Strait gesture of goodwill and Yuan Zai is their first cub.

The public will have to wait another couple of months before they can catch a glimpse of the first panda born in Taiwan.

Over at Highland Wildlife Park zoo keepers have been celebrating the birth of a little boy.

Kitty and Kevyn, the Park's pair of red pandas, are officially proud parents to Kush.

Keepers are pleased with the youngster's progress, with first-time mum Kitty taking great care of him.

Born at the beginning of June, Kush is also the Park's first ever red panda cub and the first to be born in one of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's animal collections in 13 years.

Douglas Richardson, head of living collections for the Highland Wildlife Park said: 'Kush's current preoccupation is eating and sleeping, mainly the latter, and he was fairly affronted when we interrupted his afternoon nap to give him his initial examination.

'There was a little bit of growling and barking and trying to appear big and dangerous when we were examining him, but it was a little difficult to take something that cute and fluffy seriously.'

Kitty and Kevyn, who are both two years old, joined the Park only last year with Kitty arriving in May from Berlin Tierpark and Kevyn two months later from Aalborg Zoo, Denmark.

Keepers are particularly pleased with the arrival of Kush as the pair had only recently reached sexual maturity.

Red panda cubs are born completely helpless and take a few months to develop.

At first they are very small and completely blind, relying completely on their mother for protection.

They resemble very fluffy guinea pigs for several weeks and only start to venture outside of their den at approximately three months old.

Due to their sensitivity, Kush and his parents will be off show for the next few weeks.
