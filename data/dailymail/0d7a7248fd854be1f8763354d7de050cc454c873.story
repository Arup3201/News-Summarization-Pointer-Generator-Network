One of my favourite sayings comes from the legendary French chef Fernand Point.

When cooking, he said that you must never forget the mantra: ‘Du beurre! Donnez-moi du beurre! Toujours du beurre!’

These words, taken from his book Ma Gastronomie, mean: ‘Butter! Give me butter! Always butter!’

Simon Hopkinson says there is no substitute for butter, and that a little bit of the spread is essential to his life

Point, who was awarded three Michelin stars for his cooking at La Pyramide restaurant near Lyon after World War I, also once observed that one should ‘never trust a thin chef’.

It is for such passionate pronouncements on food that Point is the chef I’d most like to have cook me lunch.

I have always known that just a little butter is essential in my life. Delicious to cook with or to eat just as it is, it richly flavours endless dishes.

So, what a joy it is to read that, after years of margarine dominating our supermarket shelves, butter is back. Sales have risen by 7 per cent over the past five years, while those of margarine have fallen by 6 per cent.

Butter has precious few competitors. It is a unique product, extraordinarily versatile, relatively inexpensive and, even at the lower end of the quality ladder, most acceptable melting on to hot toast or just-boiled new potatoes.

My late father, when eating toast for breakfast, would add butter to each ‘bite’ of his toast.

Rather than buttering the slice all at once, the first corner would receive a generous smear, then he would eat that and put the slice back down.

Having read about half a page of his newspaper — the Daily Mail, as it happens — he would then butter the bit of toast that would form his next bite, applying a little more this time. And so on.

Sometimes there would be a ratio of more butter than toast, simply because he loved the taste so much. Dad  was never overweight and lived until  he was 89.

Butter has been unfairly demonised and, of course, if you eat too much of it you might become fat.

If you eat too much of anything, you may get even fatter. And, furthermore, if you eat too much all the time and sit on your bottom all day, you could get very fat indeed.

'Delicious to cook with or to eat just as it is, it richly flavours endless dishes. So, what a joy it is to read that, after years of margarine dominating our supermarket shelves, butter is back'

That little lecture is sharply given, maybe, but the moral is simple: a little bit of butter; not too much.

My initiation to the joys of butter began early.

At the age of 16, I was taken on as an apprentice during school holidays in the kitchen of La Normandie restaurant, not far from where I grew up in Bury, near Manchester.

The French owners, as you might imagine, hailed from Normandy, so butter was a big thing with them and there was a lot of it about.

Boxes and boxes were imported from France every two months. And Norman butter it most certainly was, complete with a picture of Le Mont Saint-Michel printed on each wrapper.

In those days, the early Seventies, unsalted butter was rare indeed. It seemed so pale in comparison to our more tasty, yellow, salted, branded butters bought from the supermarket.

'When asked whether I would choose best dairy butter over the finest extra virgin olive oil as the preferred grease in my life, then I absolutely know the answer. It will be butter, every time'

Yet, I soon came to love its delicacy, with a purity so suited to the rich French cooking I was there to learn.

There was no skimping at La Normandie. Each day we would make a quantity of sauce hollandaise — enough to last an evening’s service. The recipe called for ten packets of this beautiful butter.

Melted, then clarified to remove the water and milk solids, leaving only butterfat, it would be hand-whisked into 30 egg yolks — already whipped to a thick mousse over a low heat — until the mixture formed a glossy, thick emulsion.

For this keen, teenage cook, that hollandaise was my introduction to the magic of butter.

As a chef, I am often asked about my preference for one ingredient over another. Such questions can be irritating — surely it depends on the recipe?

However, when asked whether I would choose best dairy butter over the finest extra virgin olive oil as the preferred grease in my life, then I absolutely know the answer. It will be butter, every time.

And, anyway, we do dairy well in this country, and not much olive oil.

I will always want my morning poached egg laid upon a slice of thickly buttered, soft white toast rather than oil-soaked bruschetta. And it is only best butter that makes scrambled eggs taste so good. An omelette without butter is unthinkable.

Though a Spanish tortilla made with onions quietly stewed in olive oil may be fabulous when perfectly executed, it will always be a secondary treat compared with onions stewed in butter.

Asparagus, too, is glorious eaten warmly buttered. And if I ever found that my Brussels sprouts were shined with olive oil rather than butter, I would regrettably have to shoot the cook. Discreetly, of course.

The onions that begin the making of a risotto, I have always believed, should be gently stewed in butter, rather than olive oil. Yet cooking onions in olive oil now seems to be the initial instruction of all risotto recipes.

'I will always want my morning poached egg laid upon a slice of thickly buttered, soft white toast rather than oil-soaked bruschetta. And it is only best butter that makes scrambled eggs taste so good'

Why is this? Risotto originated in northern Italy, where butter is the preferred, indigenous fat, so its use is as natural as can be. Frankly, I think that most cooks have simply forgotten how to quietly cook a chopped onion in just butter.

A pat of butter in which to scrape the crisp tip of a thin breadstick is essential. Once, in a silly, posh restaurant — and in France, of all places! — a tiny dish of olive oil was offered instead. ‘I don’t know what to do with this,’ I muttered angrily.

How did we lose our daily love of butter in the first place? When I was a child, bread always came with butter.

But for the past 20 years our supermarkets have been filled with an absurd amount of olive oil and all kinds of TV programmes, books and cookery journalism seemed to omit butter in recipes.

Fridges were filled with tubs of  so-called ‘spreadable’ butters blended with olive, sunflower or corn oils. Even the French were doing them — zut alors!

I find such butter unpleasant to use on toast as it has an over- emulsified texture. Slimy, almost.

It occasionally has its uses in baking, though. This curious stuff is surprisingly good when incorporated into a rich bread dough I make, as it remains soft at room temperature. It keeps bread moist once it is baked. I usually make soft rolls with this sort of dough.

But I would only ever think of it as ‘baking butter’, never as something to spread on my toast, thank you very much. Thank goodness that real butter is once again restored to our affections.

As with childhood memories of unpasteurised milk in a glass bottle or a lick of thick, pale yellow cream, there is something about a lump of butter cut with a big knife from a block that speaks of special treats.

Folded into its hand-wrapped paper package, artisan hand-churned butter seems like a  present bought for oneself.

I sometimes wonder just what the first block of my favourite Lurpak butter, churned at the end of the 19th century, tasted like.

I imagine it being offered for sale by the farmgate, all cool, pale and creamy, by a kindly Danish farmer’s wife.

It almost sounds like a scene from a Grimm’s fairy story — two small children smeared with butter for roasting later, that sort of thing — but I bet it would have been utterly delicious. The original real thing.

For there is nothing quite like the taste of best butter.
