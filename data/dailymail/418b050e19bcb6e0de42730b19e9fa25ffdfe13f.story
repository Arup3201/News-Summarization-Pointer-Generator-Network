The problem for Brendan Rodgers is that he does not talk a very good game.

Not in front of the media.

No matter how strategically astute and psychologically persuasive he may be in the Liverpool dressing room, he comes across as dreadfully insecure in his public utterances.

The desperation for professional respect is matched by an aching desire to be liked. Loved, even.

Brendan Rodgers gets his point across as Liverpool train ahead of the FA Cup clash with Bolton this week

Rodgers also had plenty to say after watching his side draw 1-1 with Chelsea in the League Cup in midweek

Hence, under interview, the mouth has a tendency to open before the mind has become fully engaged.

The frantic leaps to the defence of the indefensible, take Luis Suarez , the glaring-eyed insistence that his team have played well when it is manifest to most observers that they have not, the trumpeting of his own tactical cleverness – all betray that anxious personality trait.

They delve below the basic precept of a manager defending his players, deep into his own awkward psyche.

Nor is he simply saying what he supposes the Anfield faithful want to hear.

Fiercely supportive though the residents of the Kop may be when anyone outside the red brethren dares to criticise, they are shrewd and analytical when debating their team and manager among themselves.

To be fair to Rodgers, his side outplayed Chelsea at Anfield with Raheem Sterling (left) scoring for the hosts

But the end result was a 1-1 draw and the Reds face a test in next week's second leg at Stamford Bridge

This is not even as basic as a runaway ego-trip, even though there may be a certain arrogance involved.

What Rodgers seems utterly unable to grasp is that, often, less is more.

Tuesday night was a classic example of when he would have been better letting his team do the talking.

We had all watched as they soared above their recent performance level to give Chelsea a good old-fashioned Liverpool chasing in the first leg of their Capital One semi-final.

It would have been enough for Rodgers to say they were unlucky not to win and that if they play like this again they have a good chance of coming away from the return at Stamford Bridge clutching a ticket to Wembley.

Not our Brendan. He kept banging on about how wonderful they had been, how brilliantly he and they had run Chelsea ragged, that they are back to the form which can win any and every trophy this season.

Or words to that effect.

Luis Suarez always had the full backing of Rodgers during the striker's time at Anfield

So forcibly did he ram it down our throats that we barely had time to open our own mouths in praise of Liverpool.

By the time we could get a word out others were reminding us that the score was only 1-1, after all.

If this was not in character, we might have supposed that it was the presence of Jose Mourinho in the opposite dugout which had made his tongue run away with him. 

Can the gift of the gab rub off even more on an Irishman, from either side of the border? Well, Mourinho is one of football’s most animated talkers in front of a camera and the style may well have been somewhat contagious.

The difference is that when Mourinho speaks there is a invariably a purpose behind what he has to say. Be it to play mind games with rival managers, unsettle opposing players, galvanise his own team, affect the thinking of a referee or even disarm the fans of other clubs.

Is there some self-importance involved? Of course. But with Rodgers, whether he realises it or not, it seems to be even more about himself.

At least, on air.

Those from within would assure us that this appearance is deceptive.

Rodgers and Liverpool will wave captain Steven Gerrard off at the end of the season

Even Steven Gerrard – whose dropping from the last grand European occasion of his career Rodgers handled so clumsily – still insists that as a flexible coach and motivational man manager his boss is ‘phenomenal’ and ‘blows me away.’

Presumably, although Gerrard is being allowed to leave Anfield for Los Angeles at the end of this season, that last remark is not to be taken literally.

It may be of some help to Rodgers to recount how the most beloved of all Liverpool managers also became the one with the most unforgettably brilliant one-liners.

Gerrard, taking a break during Thursday's session at Melwood, describes Rodgers as phenomenal

The sayings of Bill Shankly are legend and the manner in which he delivered one of them makes it a favourite of mine.

George Best had just torn Liverpool apart to inspire a Manchester United success at Anfield and Shanks was holding court as usual in the tunnel outside the Boot Room.

After some shuffling of feet someone ventured: ‘Well, Bill, what did you think of Best?’

There was a prolonged silence as Shankly bit on the knuckle of his right forefinger, as was his habit, and pondered the question.

Finally he answered: ‘Aye, wee Georgie. He’s the deepest tackler in the game.’

Shankly had assumed that anyone with so much as a modicum of knowledge about football would know they had just seen a genius at work. So he doffed his cap to the physical courage which enabled Best to defy the most rugged of opposing defenders so as to deliver performances like that.

With those few words he implied sympathy for his own players in trying to cope with Best at his greatest, while taking nothing away from United.

If Sterling turns on the style again, we won't need Rodgers to tell us how good Liverpool can be

Shankly had also mastered the art of knowing when to speak with tongue in cheek. As has Mourinho.

Neither would have blurted out the risible remark which ranks as the most foolish spoken by Rodgers in praise of Suarez – as well as in defence of his own reluctance to condemn the unspeakable behaviour with which the fang-man blighted his talent as a goalscorer.

When Suarez was voted Footballer of the Year – mistakenly in my view since the historic Football Writers’ Award is supposed to be bestowed for exemplary conduct as well exceptional performance – Rodgers accepted the award on behalf of his absent player by saying: ‘I am a better person for knowing Luis Suarez.’

Not all the laughter in that banqueting hall was successfully stifled.

Rodgers is clearly a clever coach, one refreshingly willing to alter and adapt his tactics, deeply passionate about the game, honoured to have this job at Liverpool and by all accounts a rousing man manager.

But it is for the rest of us, not for him, to say so.

Bobby Moore was one of the greatest defenders of all time - man of the match in the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley - and remains the only England captain ever to raise that trophy aloft.

So let me advise Rodgers, also, of what Moore had to say whenever he was asked about his fame: ‘If you’re quite good at something, you don’t have to tell anyone.’
