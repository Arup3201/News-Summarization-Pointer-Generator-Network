Rolf Harris's five-year, nine-month sentence, of which he will serve half, will remain unchanged after a decision by the Attorney General

Convicted paedophile Rolf Harris will not see his jail term increased after the Government's chief legal adviser decided not to mount an appeal.

Despite a stream of complaints, Attorney General Jeremy Wright has decided not to refer the disgraced entertainer's sentence of five years and nine months to the Court of Appeal.

Mr Wright's decision comes despite his office receiving 150 complaints about the leniency of Harris's sentence, of which the 84-year-old will serve half behind bars.

Harris, a household name for decades, was finally unmasked as a prolific paedophile following his conviction for 12 indecent assaults at the end of last month.

The court heard the Australian-born entertainer used his celebrity status to grope and abuse young women and girls over a 40-year period.

Despite it only taking one complaint to trigger a review process, the Attorney General's Office (AGO) confirmed today that the prison term would not be challenged. 

An AGO spokesman said: 'The Attorney General understands that his decision not to refer the case may be a disappointment to some people; however, he did give extremely careful consideration to this sentence and he concluded that he could not refer it.'

He added: 'After very careful consideration, the Attorney General, Jeremy Wright QC MP, has decided not to refer the five-year and nine-month sentence given to Rolf Harris to the Court of Appeal, as he did not think they would find it to be unduly lenient and increase it.

'The sentencing judge was bound by the maximum sentence in force at the time of the offending.

'The judge made some of the sentences consecutive to reach the total sentence, but he could not simply add up sentences on individual counts; the overall sentence had to be just and proportionate to the overall offending.

'The judge was also required to take into account the age of the offender.'

The decision came as theatre bosses in Plymouth, Devon decided to remove a self-portrait Harris painted on a dressing room wall.

Harris created the mural, which shows him peeping over the branch of a tree, when he appeared in a family panto at the Theatre Royal in 1993.

But the 21-year-old painting will now be covered over after Harris's conviction.

A spokesman for the Theatre Royal said: 'The Rolf Harris mural in dressing room G4, which is currently protected by perspex, is now going to be covered in vinyl to obscure it.'

Experts say artworks by Harris which were once worth as much as £70,000 are now worthless because of his crimes.
