The lavish wealth of underdog-defending filmmaker Michael Moore has been laid bare in his divorce battle with now-ex-wife Kathy Glynn, and their breakup is the talk of their small Michigan community.

The couple called it quits after 22 years, with the divorce finalized on Tuesday at Antrim County Circuit Court in Bellaire.

According to Celebritynetworth, Moore and Glynn are worth $50 million, much of his success coming from documentaries protesting capitalism.

The pair own nine properties, with Moore splitting his time between Detroit and New York.

The Detroit News reports that Moore blamed Glynn in legal proceedings for an expensive extension on their 10,000-square-foot mansion on Torch Lake in Michigan, which is valued at $2 million.

They also own a Manhattan condo that once was three apartments. 

The 60-year-old made it big with his documentaries 'Bowling for Columbine,' 'Roger & Me,' 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' and 'Capitalism: A Love Story.'

Gary Tracy, owner of Bellaire Bait and Tackle told The Detroit News: 'He criticizes capitalism, but capitalism made him rich. Why he decided to live in this conservative area, I have no idea.'

Another neighbor said: 'He is not a common man. No way.'

And he seems to be aware of how he's perceived.

In legal proceedings, he listed six media reports from 2011, which poked fun at the defender-of-the-poor's lavish life with headlines like 'Mansion Begs The Question: Is Michael Moore A Hypocrite?' and 'Michael Moore's $2M Hypocrite House: Film Director Lives Like The 1% He Condemns.'

The couple met working at a biweekly newspaper Moore founded in the mid-70s and married in 1991 after nine years of dating.

Moore
 said that Glynn, who co-produced his earlier documentaries, stopped 
living in their Manhattan condo in 2004, though no reasons were given 
for that.

It's over: After the divorce was finalized, Moore posted this to Facebook

Moore told the court the couple split in 2010 but Glynn said the relationship only ended last year, when Moore filed for divorce.

In legal documents, Moore appeared to take issue with how the couple's cash was being spent, stating that he took over the management of their funds after Glynn's spending led to 'serious financial losses.'

He also questioned whether Glynn had ever hired a private investigator.

But after all was said and done, Moore took to Facebook to celebrate the divorce being finalized.

After the divorce was finalized he wrote, 'Kathleen and Michael have mutually and amicably reached a divorce settlement,' linking to a YouTube clip of Bruce Springsteen's Rosalita (Come Out Tonight) from 1984.
