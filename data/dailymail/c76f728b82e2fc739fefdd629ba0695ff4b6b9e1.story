This party season sees the introduction of the turbocharged Bloody Mary using ingredients such as Horseradish-infused vodka at London's 69 Colebrooke Row (pictured)

It's almost the most wonderful time of the year and for many of us that means a brilliant excuse to overindulge, party on a school night and mix our drinks with merry abandonment.

Which is great. Until the morning after.

After many years of research we know that festive hangovers don't get any easier with practice, but instead of telling you to drink a glass of water for every glass of alcohol, or make sure you get eight hours of sleep (yawn) we think it's much more practical to offer advice on how to turn around the terrible hangover you had so much fun creating.

Step up, the Bloody Mary. A cocktail 
classic that has magical healing properties, aka a dash of breakfast 
booze to help clear the heaviest of heads. Plus the tomato juice mixer 
counts as a health drink and one of your five a day (we think).

Before
 you run to Tesco and start mixing your own though it is important to 
remember that not all Bloody Marys are created equal. Most bartenders 
have their own special recipe and this season ambitious mixologists have created some seriously wonderful and weird concoctions based on the classic. So much so that this week our favourite 
drink (and therefore hangover) specialist BarChick is celebrating the breakfast cocktail in all its scarlet glory on her site.

She says: 'There’s only one thing worse than a bad Bloody Mary: a Virgin Mary (or as the Aussies say, a Bloody Shame). BarChick is big on brunch with all the bar hopping we do, so a healthy start to the day (with a little hair of the dog) is essential.

'Much more fun than a multivitamin/Berocca fix – BarChick washes her milk thistle down with a Bloody Mary. Always open to experimentation with this British classic, just don’t try and fob us off with a bottle of Big Tom.'

From stuffed
 chilli garnish to 'celery air' and steak juice, BarChick has hunted down the UK's best 
hangover-busting Bloody Mary recipes to inspire your taste buds and help heal your morning after heads. We can't promise they will make you feel 100% fresh, but at this time of year every little helps.

1. The Keep It Classic Mary

For a straight forward BM fix keep the over the top frills to a minimum and add a bit of interest with infused vodkas. Try a dash of orange juice and HP sauce like Jake at Portobello Star in Notting Hill or try a take on The Red Snapper from Mark Hix which uses Beefeater London dry gin poured with Sundance tomato juice, lemon juice, Tabasco sauce. Mega mixologist Tony C at 69 Colebrooke Row uses a homemade horseradish vodka mixed with pepper sauce and some pepper distillate (whatever that is), which seriously does the job.

2. The Quirky Mary

The Natalia Vodianova from Bob Bob Ricard in Soho uses clear tomato water (the juice of a tomato is actually a clear liquid, you can recreate at home with a bit of blending and a lot of straining) and makes for a much lighter drink if your stomach is feeling delicate.

Prince Harry haunt Barts has a full Bloody Mary menu including a tomato-flavoured martini (hold the juice) and the Bloody Liability which includes Belvedere vodka, Bloodshot vodka, fresh 
beetroot, lemon juice and honey. Garnished with green salad topped with 
beetroot and parmesan shavings.

Barts in Chelsea favours a Bloody Mary Martini, hold the juice (l) while The Bloody Caesar at Powder Keg Diplomacy features house cured maple bacon infused vodka and clam broth (r)

3. The Meaty And Fishy Mary

The Bloody Caesar at Powder Keg Diplomacy is made with house-cured-maple-bacon-infused vodka, a classic spice mix, lemon, Clamato juice, tomato juice and clam broth, garnished with a strip of crispy maple cured bacon. For a more intense take on the drink the Meaty Mary uses vodka infused with Sunday’s topside of beef plus a splash of Sunday roast gravy.

Steak restaurant The Hawksmoor also add meaty juices to their recipes and their award-winning Pete’s Tabasco 2010 uses the bacon cooked clam broth straight from the kitchen.

4. The Garnished Mary

For fish fans the Bonnie Gull at Bonnie Mary's comes with infused vodka, gin OR tequila garnished with an oyster or if you're feeling brave take inspiration from the Southsider Cocktail Club who use Beef Jerky Infused Gentleman Jack Whiskey ,Yellow Tomato Juice, Lime Juice, Tobasco Habenero Sauce, Bitter Truth Celery Bitters and Worchester Sauce served in a soup can finished off with a Feta Stuffed Red Chilli.

The Beard to Tail Marvellously Bloody recipe (l) is sure to grow a few hairs on your chest with a mixture of Jack Daniel’s, tomato juice and a garnish of pork crackling while Bonnie Mary's Bonnie Gull (r) is simply delicious served with an oyster

5. The Spicy Mary

A big night demands a big remedy and the Beard to Tail Marvellously Bloody is sure to grow a few hairs on your chest: A mixture of Jack Daniel’s, tomato juice, Worcester sauce, mixed chilli spice, smoke paprika, port, fresh lemon juice and topped off with a garnish of pork crackling.

The Engineer in Primrose Hill used to have Kate Moss as a regular so they must know what they are doing. Their exotic-tasting BM is made with their own chilli and rosemary infused Triple Distilled Smirnoff Black and a base mix of spices, Worcester sauce, Tabasco, wholegrain mustard, Dijon and black peppercorns. To seal the deal the bartenders ‘garnish the hell out of it’ with tomatoes, cucumber, mozzarella and whatever else they can get their hands on. This can be adapted at home according to your quease levels.

The award-winner: The Connaught's impressive concoction features a touch of naga jolokia, the hottest chilli in the world

6. The Award-Winning Mary

For those mornings when only the best (and somebody else making it) will do then call in late to work and head to the creme de la creme of the cocktail world for breakfast.

As winner of the Tabasco British Bloody Mary challenge the Artesian bar's Roman Foltan is the man to save you with a killer drink. His Smoked Bloody Mary uses Ketel One vodka infused with lemongrass smoke mixed with their signature spiced tomato with a side of pickles and oyster leaves.

Or try The Connaught, who are always winning awards, with their mix of tomato juice, lemon, coriander, salt, pepper and a touch of the hottest chilli in the world, the naga jolokia. It’s served with what they call “celery air”, by running the celery through a juicer, then foaming it, they are able to get a full aroma of celery and the whole thing is finished off with a light grating of nutmeg. Job done.
