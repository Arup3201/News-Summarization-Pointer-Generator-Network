It was a mainstay on the NASCAR circuit for nearly five decades.

But now, North Wilkesboro Speedway in North Carolina -  once filled with thousands of fans at a time - lies silent and deserted.

The legendary track, which opened its doors to a crowd of more than 10,000 in 1947, was recently caught on camera by photojournalist Seph Lawless.

The photojournalist, also an activist, captured the dilapidated arena as part of an ongoing project which focuses on 'the most abandoned' sites in America.

He told Daily Mail Online: 'This arena was once filled with thousands of people now it sits eerily silent and completely abandoned. It was apocalyptic.'

Legendary: The track, which opened its doors to a crowd of more than 10,000 in 1947, was  caught on camera by photojournalist Seph Lawless

Deserted: Mr Lawless captured the dilapidated arena as part of an ongoing project which focuses on 'the most abandoned' areas of America

'It was apocalyptic:  'This arena was once filled with thousands of people now it sits eerily silent and completely abandoned,' Mr Lawless said

Flashback: Terry Labonte (No 5) and Elton Sawyer (No 27) bring the field to the start of the First Union 400 at the speedway on April 14, 1996

Hopes: Mr Lawless, also an activist, continued: 'Certain parts of America decline so fast these days, they should paint racing stripes on it'

Damaged: Mr Lawless's stunning photos show faded racetrack signs, thousands of vacant seats and buildings with damaged ceilings (above)

Out of use: A building at the speedway is pictured in a state of disrepair (left), while a sign showing drivers' positions is no longer lit up (right)

He added: 'Certain parts of America decline so fast these days, they should paint racing stripes on it.'

The short speedway, measuring five-eights of a mile, held races in NASCAR's top three series from 1949 until its closure in 1996. That year, it was sold to ex-New Hampshire Motor Speedway owner Bob Bahre and Speedway Motorsports's CEO Bruton Smith due to its age and lack of modern facilities.

Its spring date was taken over by Smith's new Texas Motor Speedway, while its fall date was given to Bahre's New Hampshire track.

In 2010, North Wilkesboro Speedway briefly reopened, playing host to several Stock Car series. However, it closed again in the spring of 2011. 

It has sat empty since.

The refreshments section of the  arena lies abandoned, while red paint is ripped off the wall surrounding a sign reading, 'President's Lounge'. 

'It's not every day that you come across an abandoned NASCAR race speedway,' Seph Lawless, who goes by a pseudonym, told Daily Mail Online. 

Aged: In 1996, the speedway was sold to ex-New Hampshire Motor Speedway owner Bob Bahre and Speedway Motorsports CEO Bruton Smith

Wrecked signage: In 2010, the track briefly reopened, playing host to several Stock Car series. However, it closed again in the spring of 2011

No sale: The refreshments section of the arena - which once catered for thousands of spectactors from across the world - now lies abandoned

Vacant: The speedway's thousands of seats are vacant after the speedway closed in 1996 - and later, re-closed, after a brief opening in 2011

Worn: Red paint is ripped off the wall surrounding a sign reading, 'President's Lounge', which signaled the place that executives would gather

Desolate: Mr Lawless, whose project is called Autopsy of America and covers all 50 states, is  filming a reality TV show based on his work

Looking out: The US photojournalist hopes his pictures of deserted sites - such as North Wilkesboro Speedway - will raise awareness of them

Inspiring change: However, he also hopes the images will 'inspire creative solutions' to their abandoned states. Above, a shot of the speedway

Exit: 'This isn't social media. This is a social movement,' said Mr Lawless, who posts some of his images on Facebook , Instagram and Twitter

The US photojournalist, whose project is called Autopsy of America and covers all 50 states, is currently filming a reality TV show based on his work.

He hopes that his pictures of deserted sites - such as North Wilkesboro Speedway - will not only raise awareness of them, but 'inspire creative solutions'.

'This isn't social media. This is a social movement,' said Seph Lawless, who posts some of his images on his Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages.

He added: 'The problems my country faces won't change until we face these problems, so I thought we could start by simply looking at them.'

Tackling issues: Mr Lawless said Americans need to 'face these problems', adding: 'so I thought we could start by simply looking at them'

Course: This photo, captured by Mr Lawless during his trip to North Carolina, shows part of the speedway, which once attracted thousands

Disrepair: The photojournalist is not the only one who is hoping to inspire change at the speedway, which offered spectators up-close views

Authorization needed: A handwritten sign fixed to two planks of wood at North Wilkesboro Speedway reads: 'Authorized photographers only'

NASCAR: A poster reading 'NASCAR Winston Cup Series' is pictured on the side of a building at the legendary racetrack in North Wilkesboro

Battle: An organization named 'Save the Speedway' , founded in 2005 by Rob Marsden, still actively fights for the reopening of the speedway

Chance of transformation? The group has thousands of followers, all of whom share the vision of 'a new life at North Wilkesboro Speedway'

And Seph Lawless is not the only one who is hoping to inspire change at the speedway, which offered spectators up-close views of passing drivers. 

An organization named 'Save the Speedway', founded in 2005 by Rob Marsden, still actively fights for the reopening of the track. 

The group now has thousands of followers, all of whom share the vision of 'a new life at North Wilkesboro Speedway'.

The final Sprint Cup race at the speedway was won by driver Jeff Gordon in September 1996.

Weather-torn: When it opened in 2010, the track briefly played host to several Stock Car series, like the now defunct ASA Late Model Series

Sunset: It also played host to the USARacing Pro Cup Series (formerly Hooters Pro Cup) and PASS Super Late Models before closing again

Striking: This photo of North Wilkesboro Speedway, captured by Mr Lawless, shows the track in a very different state to what it used to be
