Giovanni Di Stefano earned £3.4million between July 2004 and June 2012 while posing as a qualifed lawyer

A bogus lawyer known as the 'Devils Advocate' earned an income 'worthy of a footballer' by taking on cases of notorious criminals, a court has heard.

Giovanni Di Stefano, 58, earned £3.4million over eight years, the equivalent of more than £35,000 a month, while fraudulently claiming he was legally trained.

The former Dundee FC director claimed to have represented people such as Saddam Hussein and Ronnie Biggs and boasted of meetings with Osama Bin Laden and Robert Mugabe.

He described Dr Harold Shipman’s conviction as ‘absolutely outrageous’ in a 2004 BBC documentary, adding that he would defend Adolf Hitler if he was alive - and even Satan if possible.

The Italian gave himself the title of 'avvocato' and posed as a qualified lawyer for eight years, despite only having an honorary degree from the University of Belgrade.

In March he was locked up for 14 years for his ‘wicked’ con from July 2004 to June 2012.

A confiscation hearing at Southwark Crown Court was told by prosectuor Patrick Moran how Di Stefano used ‘grains of truth to build mountainous lies’ to secure ‘an income worthy of a footballer’.

It was agreed by both the prosecution and defence that he profited by £3,417,697.25.

But Di Stefano’s defence barrister Nathaniel Rudolph claimed his client had blown every penny of his ill-gotten gains.

Judge Alistair McCreath reserved judgement on the amount Di Stefano must repay until a later date.

The ruling is expected to be announced before Christmas.

Di Stefano was convicted of 29 fraud, money laundering and forgery charges following a trial at the court.

He pocketed a £150,000 insurance payout from Anthony Chatzfotiou, whose left arm was amputated after a horrific coach crash in Argentina on New Year’s Eve 2009.

He also ripped off £160,000 from David Brown, an engineer for Hertfordshire Police Authority, after acting as his legal advisor in an employment dispute.

Di Stefano used the money to enjoy a lavish lifestyle, living in luxury properties in Monte Carlo and Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills.

He also dined in top restaurants such as The Ritz and Le Caprice and shopped in designer stores including Prada.

Di Stefano claimed to have 'enjoyed a friendship' with Slobodan Milosevic’s daughter and lived in the former Serbian president’s home in 1993.

He also recalled a ten-minute meeting with Bin Laden in Baghdad’s Al-Rashid hotel in 1998, during a trip to meet Saddam Hussein while he ruled Iraq.

Di Stefano boasted about his connections in BBC documentary, 'Notorious: The Devil’s Advocate'.

He joked about being dubbed ‘Mr Murder’ during a phone call to discuss representing mass murderer Jeremy Bamber, who was handed a life sentence for killing five family members.

Di Stefano moved to Yugoslavia in 1992 after being thrown out of the US for being an ‘undesirable alien’, and wound up meeting notorious warlord Arkan.

He told programme makers the Butcher of Belgrade is ‘a lovely man, a great man’, and went on to say that if Hitler needed legal advice: ‘I would not even need to think about it, I would take Satan’s case too’.

Di Stefano fleeced further clients after his documentary was broadcast, including convicted killer Paul Bush who was jailed for life at the Old Bailey in 2003 for murder.

Bush’s wife paid £10,000 to the Italian to secure bail for the killer, but the money was quickly withdrawn from the bank account before Bush was told there was no possibility of him being released.

Convicted cocaine smuggler Laurent Penchef lost 10,000 Euros in June 2005 after Di Stefano agreed to lead his bid to be moved to France to serve his 18-year jail sentence.

When one judge challenged Di Stefano on his legal credentials, he claimed the records had been destroyed in an earthquake.

He admitted in evidence he was not a qualified lawyer, but said he only realised this ‘in hindsight’.

Di Stefano, of Marshside, Canterbury, Kent, denied nine counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, one of attempting to obtain a money transfer by deception, one of obtaining property by deception, three of acquiring criminal property, one of using criminal property, eight counts of fraud and two counts of using a false instrument.

He admitted two further counts of fraud, with two further counts of fraud and another count of theft, relating to a stolen BMW, left on the court file.
