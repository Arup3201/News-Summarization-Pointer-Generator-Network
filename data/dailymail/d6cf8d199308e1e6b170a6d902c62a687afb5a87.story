A New York man confessed to killing his 8-year-old son when cops saved him from an attempted suicide on Sunday.

Officers responding to a 911 call around 10pm found 41-year-old Boujeke Kenmoe on the floor of his Flushing, Queens home bleeding from the wrists while his son lay unconscious on a bed.

When paramedics arrived at the four-family building, Kenmoe told them he had strangled his son that morning.

The little boy was pronounced dead at the scene. His name is being withheld as authorities try to inform his family.

Police went to the apartment following a 911 call from a woman who said the emotionally-disturbed man had taken pills and was trying to kill himself inside the apartment. She said she was worried about his child.

At the home, police found a two-gallon bucket filled with blood in the bathroom, along with the child's bloody clothes.

However, investigators believe the blood was from Kenmoe's self-inflicted wounds. The Medical Examiner will rule the boy's cause of death, but sources told WABC that it appears the son was strangled.

A neighbor said Kenmoe often had loud fights with his wife. The boy's mother was not at the apartment when police arrived Sunday night. Above, more pictures of Kenmoe and an unidentified boy from Facebook

Kenmoe was last reported in stable condition at Queens General Hospital. He has been charged with second-degree murder. 

It was not immediately clear who the 911 caller was. The boy's mother was not at the apartment when police arrived, and neighbors said the couple often had loud fights.

Neighbor Abed Islam told the New York Post that Kenmoe's wife had left the home for a while, but had returned at some point in an attempt at reconciliation.

'They tried to patch things up but it was still stormy in terms of their relationship,' Mr Islam said.

Kenmoe allegedly told Mr Islam that his wife 'had a plan to split the family apart so she could leave.'

Neighbors say Kenmoe was an immigrant from Africa and that his wife works at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.

One neighbor described him as 'a good guy' who is 'always ready to help people'.
