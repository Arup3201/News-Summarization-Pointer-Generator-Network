A giant pile of blazing wood chippings is still burning at a wood recycling plant in Middlesborough, four days after it caught fire.

The fire at UK Wood Recycling at Wilton has been ongoing since Monday, but emergency services will not be able to put out for at least two or three days.

The firm say the fire started in a stack of wood overnight on December 23, but it is not being treated as suspicious.

Burns, burns, burns: The pile of wood chippings at Wilton, Middlesbrough has been on fire since Christmas Eve

UK Wood Recycling has assured 
residents in the area that it is under control but high winds have 
fanned the flames and caused smoke to billow across nearby roads.

A
 spokeswoman for UK Wood Recycling said: ‘We would like to reassure 
local residents that everything is being done to contain the fire in a 
controlled manner.

‘The fire
 has escalated as a result of the extremely high winds over the past few
 days. We would like to apologise to local residents for any 
inconvenience caused.’

 time.’

A spokesman for 
Cleveland Fire Brigade said: ‘The winds are presenting us with 
difficulties at the moment but we have sufficient resources and are 
working closely with owners SembCorp Utilities to control the fire, 
which is the best course of action.

‘We expect to be here for a further two to three days.’
