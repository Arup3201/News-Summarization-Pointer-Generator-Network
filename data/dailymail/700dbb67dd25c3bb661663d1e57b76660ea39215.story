Warning: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe the only way stop people using their mobiles while driving was tougher penalties

Drivers caught using a mobile phone behind the wheel twice should be banned from the roads, according to Britain’s most senior police officer.

Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he was deeply concerned about the thousands of drivers who continue to flout the law.

The Scotland Yard boss said the only way to change their habits is to adopt a tougher line and kick them off the roads.

He said the penalty should be doubled from three points to six, meaning motorists would be banned under totting up rules if caught twice in three years.

Young and inexperienced drivers would be forced to retake their tests if they are caught once within two years of getting their licence.

The commissioner spoke out after figures revealed road deaths and casualties in the capital have increased for the first time in 20 years.

He said: ‘I have to say I have still got an issue around mobile phone usage myself. I think it is still very high when people are driving. If I was able tomorrow, I would say you get six points for driving while using a phone.

‘The problem at the moment is we are dishing out lots of tickets, somebody gets three points and they have got another three chances.

‘I would say you have got two chances. You have had a mobile phone infraction and if you do it again you lose your licence.'

His comments follow concerns that an increasing number of drivers are ignoring the ban on using their mobiles behind the wheel.

Experts believe the Government’s decision to increase the penalty from a £30 fine six years ago to £60 has had little effect on motoring attitudes.

One recent study suggested around 200,000 motorists are fined for the offence every year. Research claims driving while on a mobile slows reaction times so much it could be more dangerous than drink-driving.

Edmund King, of the AA, said using a mobile behind the wheel does not have the ‘social stigma’ of failing to wear a seat belt or drink-driving. He said: ‘There is a case for having a stronger deterrent like six penalty points.

‘This would have a particular impact on young people who would lose their licences immediately. If the penalty was increased there must be a concerted police campaign to show people there is a strong likelihood they will get caught.’

But Kevin Clinton, of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said he would prefer to see ‘more consistent enforcement’ of the existing law.

He said: ‘If drivers know there is a good chance of getting caught if they use their phone while driving, they are less likely to risk doing so.

‘Increasing the points for this offence would be inconsistent with other motoring offences, but it is very likely that the fine for a range of fixed penalty motoring offences will be increased, from £60 to £90.’

Motorists are permitted to use a phone’s speaker or hands-free kit to avoid breaking the law as long as they do not hold the phone.

Despite this, several studies have found that even speaking on a hands-free kit impairs driving ability. Some scientists argue the increased demands on the brain involved in holding a conversation on a phone – whether hand-held or hands-free – is the real danger while driving, not handling of the device.

However police can still issue a £60 fine and three points if they deem the driver not to be in control of the vehicle.

The Government said it would increase the financial penalty for using a mobile phone behind the wheel from £60 to either £80 or £100 last year but has yet to do so.
