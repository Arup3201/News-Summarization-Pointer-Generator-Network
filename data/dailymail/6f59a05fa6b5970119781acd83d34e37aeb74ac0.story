A four-year-old girl smothered to death by her paranoid schizophrenic mother was repeatedly failed by seven state agencies charged with her care in the years leading up to her death, a damning report said today.

Chantelle Blake, 33, suffocated her daughter Kaiya with a pillow after suffering from 'delusions and hallucinations' - despite the mother and child being seen by authorities at least 55 times in the space of three years.

A Serious Case Review published today revealed that just two months before Kaiya was killed her mother was assessed by an experienced psychiatrist as having no symptoms indicative of a serious mental illness.

Tragedy: A Serious Case Review has cited a catalogue of failings by authorities after paranoid schizophrenic Chantelle Blake suffocated her four-year-old daughter Kaiya with a pillow after suffering from 'delusions and hallucinations'

Each time medical opinion was sought Blake was considered not to have any enduring mental health problems, the report said.

But her own family said Blake had been mentally unwell for more than a decade

Blake, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2005, had been smoking cannabis since the age of 12. The report said the use of the drug often coincides with an exacerbation of psychosis.

She was made the subject of a hospital order after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at Manchester Crown Court last November.

During the hearing, the court heard the woman feared she was being persecuted by her neighbours, and she suffocated her four-year-old daughter 'out of love' to protect her. There is no evidence to suggest the neighbour did anything wrong.

When sentencing her, Mr Justice MacKay said: ‘The day you ended your daughter's life will, I am sure, be with you forever.’

Criticisms: A 65-page Serious Case Review report on behalf of Manchester Safeguarding Children Board criticised 'poor judgment and a lack of robustness in managerial oversight' among some of the seven state agencies who had contact with the family

The judge said it was not the purpose
of the court to punish Blake, as doctors on both sides agreed she was 
and is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.

He said: ‘I fully accept that you did what you did out of your love for and concern for Kaiya.’

He added: ‘You were thinking in a distorted and
deluded way, but you genuinely believed that you were acting to protect
your daughter from harm by persons who wished her ill. You thought that
because you were mentally ill at the time.’

Social services were first made aware 
of concerns for the child in July 2008 more than three years before her 
death when Blake said her daughter, then 18 months old, wanted to have a
sexual relationship with her and that she was hearing voices.

Twice
police used emergency powers, in July 2009 and October 2010, taking the
child from her mother, but Kaiya was returned with 'undue haste', the 
report said.

On both occasions Blake stripped her daughter naked because she said she wanted to check for signs of sexual abuse.

Parents, nursery staff and even housing 
association workmen at her flat repeatedly reported concerns but despite
a 'Child Protection Plan', conferences and strategy meetings there was a
'fairly chaotic' approach to case planning, the report said.

Damning: The report states parents, nursery staff and even housing association workmen at her flat repeatedly reported concerns

Just two months before Kaiya was killed her mother was assessed by an experienced psychiatrist as having no symptoms indicative of a serious mental illness.

On one occasion she hit Kaiya so hard at local shops, three members of the public called police.

And she told the child on another occasion at a police station: 'It's just me and you now; we will have to take each day as it comes and see how long we last. At least we know there is a place for us up there.'

The report says Manchester Children’s Social Care received a total of 10 referrals, the first being made in July 2008.

The common thread in the referrals related to concerns about Blake's mental health and her management of her daughter.

But on one occasion, after Kaiya was placed in emergency foster care in July 2009, police and a social worker visited her home, where they concluded there was no immediate concerns for the four-year-old's safety and that she should return home.

The report concluded Kaiya's death 'could not have been predicted'.

Ian Rush, chairman of Manchester Safeguarding Children Board, said: 'Whilst the report finds that the tragic death of this little girl could not have been predicted by any of the agencies working with the family, the recommendations make it clear that agencies could and should have done some things differently.

'This was a complex case, made all the more so by the mother's mental health needs, and presenting behaviour.

'This led to an over-emphasis by agencies on dealing with the mother and her needs, rather than focusing on the child and ensuring her needs were met.'

Kaiya's father, Alexander Glenford, was living mostly in Jamaica before his daughter's death.Blake believed she was being persecuted and killed Kaiya 'out of love' so no one could harm her daughter.

Kaiya
was found by police at their home in Garthorne Close, Moss Side, 
Manchester, on September 22, 2011 after the defendant turned up at 
A&E with a child's suitcase.

She had slashed her arms with a knife and told a nurse she had suffocated her daughter.Blake will only be released from hospital when cleared by doctors and by a Ministry of Justice independent review panel.

In the three years leading up to Kaiya's death, the seven agencies had numerous meetings with the mother, often with the daughter present, the report states.

The agencies saw the mother, either through home visits or through her attending services, at least 55 times. This figure includes face-to-face interactions only. There was further contact between Blake and the services through phone calls and letters.

Manchester Children's Social Care: Blake
had at least 17 face-to-face interactions with social workers between 2008
and 2011.

Greater Manchester Police: Officers met with Blake at least five times, initially in July 2008 when a visit was made to her home with social workers. The report says home conditions were seen to be of a 'high standard' and there was nothing to indicate Blake suffered from a mental health condition.

Manchester Early Years and Sure Start (Children's centre): The report cites several occasions when concerns were raised at the centre where Blake attended with her daughter from February 2009.

Adactus Housing: Housing officers spoke to Blake and workers raised concerns after attending her home on seven occasions. 

NHS Manchester: There were 19 occasions when Blake either visited health services, or health workers visited her home or met with her, from July 2008.

Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust: The trust had at least four face-to-face interactions with Blake from July 2009.

Central Manchester Foundation Trust: On July 5, 2009, police took Blake to the hospital emergency department where she was assessed by a mental health liaison nurse. It was concluded that there were no signs of mental illness, denial of auditory hallucinations or thoughts of suicide or self harm.
