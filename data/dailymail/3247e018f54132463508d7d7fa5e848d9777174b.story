Manchester United face a battle to hold on to teenager Andreas Pereira with Paris Saint-Germain poised to make a move.

The Brazilian starlet is out of contract in the summer and United are struggling to agree new terms after the youngster and his advisers rejected their opening offer.

PSG, who have already tried and failed to sign Adnan Januzaj from United, are now keen to take Pereira in the summer.

Pereira began his career at PSV Eindhoven and soon drew attention from scouts at Arsenal and Chelsea

They are not alone though as AC Milan and Roma have also shown a keen interest in the 19-year-old.

Pereira was born in Belgium to Brazilian parents and plays as an attacking midfielder. 

He began his career at PSV Eindhoven in Holland and soon drew attention from scouts at Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea. However, a personal visit from Sir Alex Ferguson ensured he chose United and he signed for the club on turning 16.

He has continued to impress in Milk Cup tournaments, the UEFA Youth League and with United's Under 18s and Under 21s. He was selected for Brazil Under 20s and made his senior United debut under Louis van Gaal as a substitute in the 4-0 Capital One Cup defeat by MK Dons.

The Brazilian is pictured in training earlier this month, but has found first-team opportunities hard to come by

Talking about his contract to Brazilian media earlier this season, Pereira said: 'My agent is in charge of everything. I asked him to do his job without telling me anything, to keep my focus on the pitch. Van Gaal told me to stay calm. He wants to give me a chance because I have plenty of talent. When he arrived at the club, I talked with him. He always does so.'

Pereira has failed to progress since though with United well covered in his position at first-team level and he is ready to leave.

There are similarities to the situation preceding Paul Pogba's departure to Juventus but United are unable to offer guarantees and Pereira and his father, former midfielder Marcos Pereira, will weigh up offers from other clubs.

Chelsea have offered Mohamed Salah to Fiorentina again as they continue discussions over the £26.8million transfer of Juan Cuadrado.

Wolfsburg delegates will be in London today (Monday) discussing the £23m departure of Andre Schurrle with his father Joachim and the finalisation of that deal will allow Chelsea to take stock of what finance they wish to push into the Cuadrado deal. 

Talks are ongoing with Shakhtar Donetsk over the possibility of Douglas Costa also coming in but the likelihood is only one will arrive at Stamford Bridge.

Salah was close to a deal with Roma last week but when the clubs failed to agree, the Italians turned their attention to Yevhen Konoplyanka of Dnipro and Luiz Adriano of Shakhtar.

Konoplyanka was a target for Everton this month but they were told the player was due to join Tottenham instead.

Tottenham would prefer to do a deal in the summer when the player is out of contract. Dnipro were pushing for £7m in January but are now leaning towards allowing him to see out his deal.

Marcus Nilsson is currently on trial at West Ham 

West Ham have extended the trial of Swedish centre back Marcus Nilsson.

The 26-year-old spent last week training with Sam Allardyce's first-team squad and impressed the coaching staff enough to be invited to stay for another week.

Nilsson, who has been capped once by Sweden, is 6ft 4in tall and decent on the ball. He now hopes to do well enough to earn a contract.

West Ham are hopeful of signing Darren Fletcher from Manchester United. The 30-year-old is keen on a move to Valencia but they have so far failed to get rid of the players they need to accommodate Fletcher on the wage bill.

A West Ham deal for Hamilton's 20-year-old left-back Stephen Hendrie is also still possible.

Stoke manager Mark Hughes has asked about the availability of Sandro Ramirez from Barcelona B after watching the teenager in action against Osasuna on Sunday.

Hughes, who is in discussions over a new two-year contract extension at Stoke, was at the Mini Estadi to take in Barcelona B's 1-0 defeat in the Spanish Segunda Division.

Winger Adama Traore and 19-year-old Sandro Ramirez have been watched before by Stoke staff as well as talented forward Jean Marie Dongou. Barca are reluctant to allow Traore to move to England just yet and have also fielded interest from Everton.

Asked afterwards if he had any interest in signing Traore and Ramirez on loan during this transfer window, he told Catalan radio station RAC1: 'They are two options.'

Stoke's more expensive option is Tottenham's Aaron Lennon.

Arsenal scout Gilles Grimandi watched Alexandre Lacazette (right) as Lyon cruised to a 2-0 win over Metz 

Arsenal scout Gilles Grimandi watched French league leaders Lyon beat Metz 2-0 on Sunday. Grimandi has been keeping a close eye on Alexandre Lacazette and Nabil Fekir, two players admired by Manchester City, while Metz winger Yeni N'Gbakoto has also been earning rave reviews. 

However, the other notable performance on Sunday came from Maxime Gonalons the defensive midfielder who has been on Arsenal's wishlist for the past two seasons.

The France international, 25, has been a key figure in Lyon's rise to the top of Ligue 1. Lyon need money but are reluctant to sell while four points clear of Marseille and PSG.

Chelsea and Hull scouts, meanwhile, watched Rennes against Caen.

Wigan have expressed an interest in Burnley striker Lukas Jutkiewicz but the Premier League strugglers won't let the striker go unless they bring another in.

They have plenty of interest in Danny Ings but the striker is still intent on seeing the season out and taking stock of his situation in the summer.

Ings has offers from Germany, Spain and England with Manchester City one of the clubs to have shown an interest as they consider their homegrown quota.

Burnley would still be able to gain £3m compensation and that is worth the gamble if Ings' goals between now and the summer keep them in the Premier League.

Tottenham would like to freshen up their attack but would prefer to sell a player first before bringing Ings in.

Wigan's Shaun Maloney has finally completed his £750,000 move to Chicago Fire.

Charlton meanwhile, are talking to Sporting Lisbon about a loan deal for 6ft 5in France Under-20 international defender Naby Sarr.

Crystal Palace and Reading are among the clubs showing an interest in Nemanja Nikolic of Videoton.

The Serbian-born Hungary international striker has been in prolific form this season with Videoton, scoring 16 goals in just 15 games yet is available for a bargain £500,000.

It is no flash in the pan either as his statistics prove. He has been consistent throughout his career with a record of 154 goals in 172 starts in all competitions for Kaposvar and Videoton, a goal every 99.8 minutes.

Celta Vigo and Bordeaux are also showing an interest as Videoton brace themselves for offers.

Palace have offered £3.5m for Rudy Gestede at Blackburn but will have to offer closer to £6m to tempt owners Venky's to sell.

Free agent Shola Ameobi also remains an option for Alan Pardew but other clubs have shown an interest in recent days.

Real Madrid have stepped into the race for Athletic Bilbao's Aymeric Laporte. 

The 20-year-old France international has been on Manchester United's radar also for the past couple of seasons but with Pepe getting older and Sergio Ramos debating a new contract, Madrid have made the first steps to taking him to the Bernabeu.

The deal won't be cheap though with Bilbao refusing to negotiate and typically pointing to his buyout clause of £31.5m plus the VAT. Laporte has potential and is a great athlete but is still a little raw.

Another option for Madrid is Inigo Martinez at Sociedad. David Moyes' side are keen on Madrid's former Sociedad midfielder Aser Illarramendi and a deal could be done in the summer unless he opts to go abroad.

Liverpool had scouts at St Etienne against Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday night. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored the only goal with Liverpool reportedly checking on Ezequiel Lavezzi. The Argentine is available for £12m but wants Champions League football. 

He came on as a late substitute for Edinson Cavani getting nine minutes on the pitch. Manchester United target Marquinhos again played at right back.

Liverpool were impressed by goalkeeper Adam Bogdan on Saturday, as reported by Sportsmail, and Neil Lennon is willing to offer him a new contract to stay at Bolton. Lennon will sign Adam Le Fondre from Cardiff on loan this week.

Bolton winger Lee Chung-yong Lee is expected to see out the season and move on a free in the summer despite interest from Crystal Palace.
