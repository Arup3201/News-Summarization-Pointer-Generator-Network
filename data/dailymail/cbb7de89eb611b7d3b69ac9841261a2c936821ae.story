Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's new book, Lean In - offering advice for how women can get ahead in the workplace - has received a mixed range of reviews from critics but none as harsh as a tweet sent to one particular negative reviewer.

Former head of public relations at Facebook Brandee Barker, who is working on promoting Sandberg’s book, sent the abusive tweet on Wednesday after becoming infuriated at the review that appeared in Dissent magazine written by another ex-Facebooker, Katherine Losse.

Losse worked as a speechwriter for CEO Mark Zuckerberg and last year published a memoir of her time at the company.

Lean in: Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, said that men still dominate the workforce and things need to change

From her review of Sandberg’s new book, Losse clearly isn’t a fan of the Facebook COO’s musings about the path forward for working women.

‘By arguing that women should express their feminism by remaining in the workplace at all costs, Sandberg encourages women to maintain a commitment to the workplace without encouraging the workplace to maintain a commitment to them,’ writes Losse.

She also compares the Lean In ‘movement’ that Sandberg is seeking to establish with Facebook’s tendency to clone or acquire potential threats.

‘By launching a feminist platform, Sandberg is able to contain the broader threat that a feminist critique poses to Facebook’s business, simultaneously generating more power for herself and her organization - Silicon Valley 'revolution' at its finest. This manoeuvre, as I learned in my years at Facebook, is how the game is played, and both Sandberg and Zuckerberg play it well.’

Author: Sheryl Sandberg's new book Lean In will be out on bookstore shelves on March 11

The review is unlikely to been well 
received by either Sandberg or Zuckerberg and Barker was quick to seek 
some retaliation: ‘there’s a special place in hell for you,’ she 
tweeted.

Since the 
controversial book launched earlier this month, Sandberg, 43, has taken 
time out from her busy job at Facebook to carry out a media tour to 
promote it.

On the eve of its release, she spoke with CBS’ ’60 
Minutes,’ about the challenges 
that modern women face, and said that they are stalled in their rise to 
power.

Herself a Harvard graduate with a very impressive resume, she currently works as Facebook’s number two in command – right next to its founder, Mark Zuckerberg.

But what’s been getting the most attention is her crusade to bring awareness to workplace inequality, and the strains put upon working women who also want to have families.

Sandberg has suggested that there are so few women running companies because they self-impose limits.

The title of her book is derived from a 2010 TED talk where she said that women hurt themselves by leaning back.

‘They say, I’m busy or I want to have a child one day, I couldn’t possibly take on any more.

'Or I’m still learning my current job. I’ve never heard a man say that to me,’ Sandberg said.

Sandberg herself was admittedly reluctant to accept her high school yearbook’s award after she was voted ‘Most Likely to Succeed.’

‘I was embarrassed,’ the mother of two said. ‘My entire life I have been told…or I have felt that I should hold back on being too successful, too smart, too – you know – lots of things.’

But the COO made it clear that she is not blaming professional women for the lack of female executives in the workforce.

A woman on the move: Sandberg, 43, launched her book earlier this month and was featured on a recent cover of Time magazine

‘There’s an awful lot we don’t 
control. I’m saying that there’s an awful lot we can control and we can 
do for ourselves to sit at more tables, raise more hands.’

She
also said that while marriage is the largest personal decision a person
can make in their lives, choosing a spouse has extreme implications in 
the workplace too. ‘Partner with the right person because you cannot 
have a full career and a full life at home with the children if you are 
also doing all the housework and childcare.’

Sandberg
has most recently been in New York City to promote her book. In a 
whirlwind of publicity, she has also been featured in Vanity Fair and 
appears on the March 18 cover of Time magazine.

Controversy: Sandberg has not helped herself with divisive speeches in which she has said: 'The moment a woman starts thinking about having a child, she doesn't raise her hand anymore'

Speaking out: Facebook chief operating officer Cheryl Sandberg, who has a personal fortune of $500million, says that there were things beyond the control of women that were holding them back

The
Facebook guru, who was ranked by Forbes as the tenth most powerful 
woman in the U.S., has been criticized for being out-of-touch with the 
modern working woman because of her extreme wealth.

According
to Forbes, Sandberg made nearly $31million in 2011, including her base 
salary for Facebook and around $30million in stock options.

Sandberg
told O’Donnell in the interview: 'I am not saying everyone has the 
resources or opportunities I have. I am not saying every husband is 
going to wake up tomorrow, read a book and do his share. I'm saying that
women need to own the power that they have, negotiate for raises.'
