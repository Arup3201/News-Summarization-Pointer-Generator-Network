When
 Su Meck was knocked unconscious by a falling ceiling fan at 22, her memory was completely 
erased and she woke up with the mental age of a four-year-old.

Now, 26 years on, the Massachusetts-based mother-of-three has discussed the devastating effect amnesia has had on her life and her family's.

In an interview with MailOnline to coincide with publication of her memoir, I Forgot to Remember, the 48-year-old revealed that she was a completely different person after her freak accident - something which her husband, Jim, understandably struggled to cope with.

'For 20 years he had affairs and would be
 away traveling a lot.

'He wasn't getting what he needed at home. It was years before I was able to have sex again,' Mrs Meck said, adding that she doesn't blame Mr Meck for his actions.

While she was a rebellious free spirit before her head injury, she was 'cold and logical' afterwards.

The concept of love and marriage was difficult to comprehend and, before she wrapped her head around that, she still had to re-learn how to read, write and even tie her shoelaces.

'I wasn't the person Jim married,' Mrs Meck mused.

Indeed, in her new memoir she highlights just how different she was - using 'she' to refer to her former-self.

Starting from scratch: Mrs Meck, pictured here at a family gathering, said that it took years to familiarize herself with places and faces and still to this day she has no memories from her youth

'She never knew me, and I know nothing of her except what people have told me.

'She rebelled; I conform. She broke rules; I follow them. She drank and smoked pot; I don’t even know the taste of beer or wine, and the smell of smoke makes me physically ill.

'I like vegetables; she hated them. She loved to swim; I am absolutely terrified of the water.'

'I never fell in love with Jim. In my eyes we never dated. I was just assigned to a family'

The music enthusiast says she has 
absolutely no recollection of her life prior to being knocked out on May
 22, 1988. It took her years to familiarize herself with places and faces.

Still
 to this day she cannot remember meeting Mr Meck at college, their first
 kiss or even being pregnant with their two sons Benjamin and Patrick, 
now aged 27 and 26.

It was around four years after her accident that Mrs Meck was able to start forming memories again.

One of the earliest things she remembers is seeing Benjamin learning to ride a two wheel bike in the driveway at home for the first time.

'Because my scans didn't show anything up doctors thought I was faking it or looking for attention. It was very frustrating,' Mrs Meck said, recalling what happened after her accident

However, one thing that set her back 
was falling pregnant in 1993. Despite having the body of a 27-year-old 
Mrs Meck said she still felt like a child.

'I was totally freaked out, I thought it was disgusting, gross!' she exclaimed.

She
 said as she watched her daughter, Cassidy, grow she felt more like a 
big sister than a mother as the two would learn how to do things 
together - from reading books to mathematical equations.

'I felt like I grew up with all of my children. Like we're siblings, it's difficult to explain,' Mrs Meck laughed.

'Because my scans didn't show anything up doctors thought I was faking it or looking for attention. But Jim had to live with me. He knew it was serious'

In 2007, almost two decades after her life-changing head injury, Mrs Meck said her marriage finally reached breaking point.

Part of the reason for this was her inability to keep on top of things at home while determinedly pursuing a music degree at Maryland’s Montgomery College.

'Studying took my attention away from things at home,' she recalled.

'When I went back to school I was scared to death and a complete mess. I forgot to make dinner, do the grocery shopping or clean.

'Jim felt very ignored during that time and he was ready to leave and had one foot out the door. I was just in "going to school mode".'

Seeing what was going on, Mrs Meck's teenage children encouraged her to seek help from a marriage counselor.

It was during a therapy session that Mr Meck confessed his infidelities.

Despite the revelation the couple decided to work things through.

Commenting about how things are now between them, Mrs Meck said: 'I never fell in love with Jim. In my eyes we never dated. I was just assigned to a family.

'We've had such a rough marriage and it's just different. We have our own ways of doing things.'

This week Mrs Meck went on a trip for the first time without a family member or friend by her side.

She said that she had more than 50 Post-It Notes dotted around her hotel room to remind her where she was and what needed doing.

Asked what her hope is for the future she replied: ‘People with Traumatic Brain Injury are often misunderstood and more research is needed into the topic.

'I'd love my story to draw more attention to the topic and to help other families who are going through the same.

'Because my scans didn't show anything up doctors thought I was faking it or looking for attention. It was very frustrating and they told me I should go and see a shrink.

'But Jim had to live with me. He knew it was serious.'

Mrs Meck is currently studying for bachelor’s degree in music at the prestigious Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. She finishes her final semester this May.

She concludes: 'I'm not ever going to be the person that I was. I feel like I'm 20.

'I have good days and bad days but I'm stronger than ever now.'

Memory loss is one of the most common side effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Even in mild cases, it is still very common. The more severe the memory loss after a TBI, the more significant the brain damage is likely to be.

Patients are often unable to recall what happened just before, during and after they sustained a head injury.

This temporary memory loss is caused by the brain swelling as a result of the damage it sustained.

It presses against the skull and even parts of it that were uninjured by the impact are still unable to function correctly. The patient's memory typically returns as the swelling goes down over a period of weeks or even months.

However, damage to the nerves and axons (connection between nerves) of the brain may also result in memory loss. The brain cannot heal itself like a limb so a victim's memory will be permanently impaired unless the brain learns how to perform it differently over a period of time by establishing new nerve connections.

This cannot be predicted but doctors now believe victims may continue to regain brain function many years after suffering a TBI.
