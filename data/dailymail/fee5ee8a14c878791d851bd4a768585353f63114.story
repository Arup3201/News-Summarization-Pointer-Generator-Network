Fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood has called Jemima Khan ‘irresponsible’ and a ‘blind feminist’ for denouncing Wikileaks rape suspect Julian Assange.

She criticised Miss Khan’s decision to condemn Assange earlier this month for his refusal to face allegations of rape and sexual assault in Sweden.

Assange, 41, skipped bail when facing extradition to Stockholm. He has been holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London since June, facing instant arrest if he steps outside.

He denies committing the sex attacks, and says he fears that, if extradited, he will be moved to America where he faces years in jail for publishing top secret US diplomatic communiques on the internet.

Miss Khan, 39, lost the £20,000 she had provided as a surety for him to the UK courts when he jumped bail. She now believes he needs to go to Sweden and fight the allegations.

Dame Vivienne has criticised Miss Khan for turning on the Wikileaks founder, less than 18 months after the pair were guests at Assange’s 40th birthday party.

Writing on her blog, she said: ‘I believe that misapplied feminism is holding Julian in legal limbo, women living in the privileged world who blindly support feminism, not seeing the wood for the trees.

‘The word “rape” has been mentioned though there are no facts to support the allegation.

‘Women want this cleared up. “I wish he would go to Sweden to answer the claims” they say.

‘Do they really want our hero to satisfy their wish and vindicate himself by spending the rest of his life in a US Supermax jail?

‘Julian is in danger because through Wikileaks he exposed the killings our authorities cover up in wars which cause death and rape.

‘So I was sad and puzzled when my friend Jemima Khan joined the ranks of these irresponsible women. I phoned Jemima. I hope she will change her mind.’

The designer’s suggestion that sexual assault allegations are worthless without additional evidence has angered campaigners.

Last night a spokesman for the Women’s Aid charity, which works to end domestic violence, criticised her assertion that there were no ‘facts’ to support the case.

She said: ‘Her comments are thoughtless and ill-advised. They don’t help the feminist cause and certainly don’t help victims of rape.

‘We’re not talking about someone making a spurious claim, we’re talking about women who have made a complaint to the police.

‘We shouldn’t be giving credence to the suggestion that there needs to be more evidence than a woman’s claim she was raped.

‘Most people think Jemima Khan has done a noble thing saying “enough is enough”.

‘I thought Vivienne Westwood was the archetypal feminist, I’m not sure what’s changed in her life.’
