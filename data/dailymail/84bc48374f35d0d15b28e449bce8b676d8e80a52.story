A Brazilian model accused of racking up $40,000 worth of charges Josh Brolin's credit card and shoplifting nearly $10,000 in clothes from Saks Fifth Avenue made a brief appearance in court yesterday.

Giselle Oliveira, 34, is charged with making a number of unauthorized clothing purchases  on the Hollywood heartthrob's American Express account between October 2010 and January 2013.

Prosecutors allege that the Latin American model also filled her shoulder bag with 'four pairs of pants, two dresses, two jackets and one scarf' totaling $9,485 at the New York department store.

Brazilian model Giselle Oliveira, 34, has appeared in court after pleading not guilty to charges of theft

According to the New York Daily News, Oliveira appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court yesterday but the judge spent just half an hour with her lawyers, after trying and failing to find a resolution to the case.

'Nothing happened today. The matter has been adjourned to Nov. 25,' Oliveira's lawyer Ellen Resnick told the newspaper. 

Oliveira, who is the former girlfriend of Mambo Kings actor Armand Assante, has pleaded not guilty to charges of theft. 

She has previously claimed her crimes was part of her work as a cooperator with the Department of Homeland Security.

She said she had been involved with some bad people including 'a Hispanic man named J' who 'threatened to show my boyfriend naked pictures of me with another man', the New York Daily News reported. 

Oliveira allegedly used No Country for Old Men star Josh Brolin's card to make $40,000 worth of purchases

The model was released on $10,000 bond, and has reportedly been staying at 64-year-old Assante's sprawling property   north of New York City - although the couple are no longer together.

Earlier this year, Page Six reported that Assante was so broke he was forced  to borrow nearly $2,000 to get  Oliveira out of jail.

According to the newspaper, Oliveira appeared in a Manhattan court saying she's been living 'the simple life' with Assante at his home.

'Armand and I live a very simple life, she said. 'I am a simple girl who comes from a farm in Brazil. I love to cook. I love to clean.'
