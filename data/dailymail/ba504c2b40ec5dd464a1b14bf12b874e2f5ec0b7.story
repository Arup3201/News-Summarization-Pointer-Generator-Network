Thousands of passengers flew to America from UK airports last week unaware they were being guarded by US air marshals amid fears that Al Qaeda was planning to explode a bomb on a transatlantic flight.

Security officials in the US said hundreds of armed sky marshals flew to Europe to accompany flights after intelligence that the terror network could be looking to mark the first anniversary of the killing of Osama Bin Laden by special forces in Pakistan.

Dozens of US-bound flights from Heathrow and Gatwick by both British and American airlines are understood to have had at least one marshal on board.

Horror in the sky: Sky marshals train to foil a terrorist attack. Hundreds have been stationed on flights between the U.S. and UK in recent weeks following an intelligence alert warning of an Al Qaeda attack

Target: The fact Gatwick was so heavily monitored suggests there was specific information that one of its departures would be targeted

Plotter? Senior Al Qaeda leader Fahd Al-Quso, killed on Sunday by a drone strike, was believed to be behind the updated underpants bomb plot

At one stage, every flight heading for
the US is said to have been ‘shadowed’ by the marshals, whose weapons 
include low-velocity bullets that carry enough force to bring down a 
potential terrorist but not enough to blow through the skin of the 
aeroplane.

Amazingly, it appeared that Scotland Yard was kept in the dark about the scale of the security operation.

The alert came after two intelligence 
breakthroughs by US investigators which provided evidence that Al Qaeda 
was still seeking to carry out attacks on US-bound commercial aircraft.

New terror alert: Al Qaeda reportedly planned to strike on the first anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death

The first was the discovery that 
terrorists were attempting to target airlines travelling from British 
and other European airports with explosives surgically implanted inside 
their bodies.

The second was the seizure by an 
undercover CIA agent of a device built without metal or tell-tale 
materials to avoid airport scanners that could be carried by a terrorist
in his underwear.

Officials would not say whether a suspect had been 
caught during the operation.

US security officials are said to have
focused particular attention on flights using British airports because 
so many US-bound flights go through the UK, and Britain has a ‘history’ 
of links to potential such attacks.

Two years ago bombs shipped to the US on cargo planes inside printer cartridges travelled through the UK.

In addition, Britain has been 
identified as a source of potential suicide bombers by the US because ‘a
significant number’ of its citizens are known to have travelled to 
Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia for terror training or to be 
sympathetic to jihadist causes.

Officials pointed out that young 
Britons, several trained in Pakistan, were part of a plot to bring down 
airliners over the Atlantic in a suspected Al Qaeda bomb plot five years
ago.

And British shoe-bomber Richard Reid 
tried to blow up a US-bound plane in 2002 – one of at least five airline
bomb plots linked to the UK.

Notified: The White House said President Obama was told about the terror plot back in April, despite his administration's claim over the last few weeks that there was no 'credible threat'

The scale of the deployment of air 
marshals had now been stepped down, officials indicated, but some ‘are 
still travelling’ while others ‘remain on standby’ in European and 
Middle Eastern cities.

Both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic declined to discuss security issues last night, as did the major US airlines.

When air marshals are on board, pilots
are aware of their presence but passengers are not told because of the 
fear of causing panic.

On an average week, around 630 
transatlantic flights depart from Heathrow. Some 17million passengers 
flew from UK airports to the US last year.

The disclosure of the plot comes amid 
efforts by Barack Obama’s  administration to make its counter-terrorism 
accomplishments a central issue in the presidential campaign.

Armed sky marshals were introduced on British airliners in 2003 in response to fears of a 9/11-style terror attack launched from airports in  the UK.

Then Home Secretary David Blunkett said the move, which was confined to transatlantic routes, was a ‘proportionate and appropriate response’ to the terror threat against this country.

At the time, reports indicated that plain-clothes officers would carry guns firing low-velocity bullets, to prevent one going through the target and piercing the shell of the plane.

In all likelihood they would be seated near the cockpit, in first or business class.

Passengers are never notified if an air marshal is on their plane, although pilots are told.

Neither the airline industry, police nor Government officials will comment publicly on the policy, and since its introduction it has largely been shrouded in secrecy.

Other countries are more open about their use of sky marshals.

The Israeli national airline, El Al, has had an armed marshal on every flight for more than a decade.

And air marshals have  been used in the US for more  than 30 years.

The bomb seized last month is said to 
be a ‘sophisticated, modified version’ of the device carried by Nigerian
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the former British-based student who tried 
to detonate his underwear device on board a packed Detroit-bound 
airliner on Christmas Day 2009.

US bomb experts are said to be picking
apart the latest device, which had a more advanced detonator than the 
one that fizzled out in the previous attack, leaving Abdulmutallab with 
severe burns.

The Nigerian, who is serving a life sentence in the US, is
to be questioned again following the latest discovery.

Officials said it was also likely that
British Al Qaeda supergrass Saajid Badat, who trained UK shoe-bomber 
Reid, will be questioned.

Badat was convicted in 2001 of trying to blow up a Miami-bound flight but released early after agreeing to become a supergrass.

Both that bomb and the new device are 
suspected of being ‘commissioned’ in Yemen by an affiliate of Al Qaeda 
and built by Saudi Arabian bomb-maker Ibrahim al-Asiri.

US officials said the CIA and other 
agencies tracked the latest plot for about a month before moving to 
seize the device in recent days in the Middle East, outside Yemen.

Officials said that the bomb or its 
components were in transit when intercepted, but that the device was not
seized at an airport and that Al Qaeda had yet to target a specific 
flight.

Officials stressed yesterday that it was a US-led operation and there was no known threat to UK airports, planes or passengers.

Scotland Yard Commissioner Bernard 
Hogan-Howe said the Metropolitan Police was not involved in the inquiry.
He said: ‘The US have said they are examining material recovered. We 
will be interested to hear what the outcome is.

‘I won’t say an awful lot more. We are
in a position of trying to get information from America to see what 
they have discovered.’

To anti-terror investigators, there was little that marked out Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab as a potential Al Qaeda recruit and suicide bomber.

As the son of one of Nigeria’s most prominent businessmen, the 25-year-old former British university student lived a privileged life with access to large funds, homes in three countries and international travel.

During his time studying mechanical engineering at University College London, he was described as a ‘quiet, caring, diligent student’. Investigators admit he ‘simply did not fit their profile’ of a potential terrorist.

Yet on Christmas Day 2009, Abdulmutallab came close to blowing up a packed transatlantic flight with explosives sewn into his underwear.

He flew from Lagos to Amsterdam, then boarded Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to Detroit, which was carrying 279 passengers and 11 crew. Hours into the flight, he tried to detonate the explosives by injecting chemicals into them.

He suffered severe burns when the bomb failed to explode, and was overpowered by passengers and crew.

Disturbingly, the bomb was not picked up in airport security checks in Lagos and Amsterdam.

Now serving a life prison sentence in the United States, Abdulmutallab is certain to be questioned again about his bomb, its maker and those who supplied it.

In London, he was president of the university’s Islamic Society and ‘crossed the radar screen’ of MI5, the UK’s domestic counter-intelligence and security agency, for radical links and communications with Islamic extremists.

But investigators say that Al Qaeda operatives identified Abdulmutallab  only as ‘vulnerable’ and did not target him until after he began studying Arabic in the Yemeni capital San’aa in August 2009.

Since the terror attacks on the morning of September 11, 2001, Al Qaeda has put different types of plans into action in numerous Jihad plots. While none of the plots have been successful, they have brought change to airport screenings and other security measures.
