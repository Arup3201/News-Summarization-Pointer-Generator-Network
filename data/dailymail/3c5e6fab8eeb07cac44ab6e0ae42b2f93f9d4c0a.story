The MP selected as Iraq's new prime minister avoided religious confrontation and was 'apolitical' when he studied at a British university, his PhD supervisor has revealed.

Those qualities will come in handy for Haider al-Abadi, a veteran Shiite lawmaker, who faces the challenge of trying to unite Iraq's divided factions.

His government then faces the problem of defeating a powerful Sunni insurgency that threatens to split the country apart and establish a new centre of Islamic extremism.

But oddly enough, despite the leadership job he now faces, Mr Abadi was not interested in politics in his younger years, says Dr Graham McLean, who supervised his postgraduate studies in engineering at Manchester University.

Dr McLean told The Times: 'He was apolitical. He never mentioned Iraq whereas some students were vociferous.

'Haider, as far as I remember, got on well with all the Middle Eastern students despite obvious problems at the time when there were extreme tensions between Iranians and Iraqis.'

Mr Abadi must cobble together a new Cabinet in just three weeks, unifying Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish factions that deeply distrust each other, all while dealing with a humanitarian crisis and the extremists' rampage in the north.

Divisive: Nouri al-Maliki stepped down this week amid accusations his disenfranchisement of Sunnis fuelled support for the Islamic State insurgency

He takes over from Nouri al-Maliki, who grudgingly stepped down after eight years in office amid accusations his disenfranchisement of Sunnis fuelled support for the extremist Islamic State insurgency.

Dr McLean, 75, guided Mr Abadi from his Masters in 1976 to the completion of his PhD in 1980. He praised his former student's 'wonderful' temperament.

He said he felt Mr Abadi had the ability to connect with people in a way many engineers could not, despite maintaining many of the creative and analytical skills the profession instills.

After completing his PhD at Victoria University of Manchester, Mr Abadi moved to London. The Times reports that there he ran his own design business as well as a café that was popular with Iraqi exiles.

Mr Abadi was born in Baghdad in 1952 and was one of thousands of prominent Iraqis who fled into exile during the regime of former dictator Saddam Hussein.

His father, a prominent Iraqi official, was forced to retire in 1979 and also fled the country, joining his son in the UK.

Two of Mr Abadi's brothers were not so lucky. They were executed in 1982 for belonging to the Dawa party. A third was jailed for 10 years.

Just in case Mr Abadi hadn't got the message while the regime cancelled his Iraqi passport in 1983

Mr Abadi returned to Iraq in 2003 after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and became a communications minister in the interim administration, then a senior adviser to Mr Maliki in Iraq's first post-invasion elected government.

Announcing his decision to step aside late on Thursday, Mr Maliki threw his weight behind Mr Abadi, a fewllow member of his Shiite Islamic Dawa party.

He had been growing increasingly isolated as he struggled to keep his post. The U.S., the UN, and even Iran - perhaps his most important ally - were in agreement that he should go.

Shiite factions turned against Mr Maliki largely because they saw him as a domineering leader who monopolised power and allowed widespread corruption. Critics say he staffed the military's officer corps with incompetent loyalists, playing a major role in the army's collapse in the face of the Islamic State militants over the past two months.

Sunni factions also accused him of widespread corruption. But their principle grievance was that his government sidelined their community, carrying out sweeping arrest raids and violently dispersing protests.

'We are ready to cooperate with al-Abadi to make him succeed in his mission on the condition that the demands of our Sunni people are met,' Ahmed al-Misari, a Sunni lawmaker, told The Associated Press.
