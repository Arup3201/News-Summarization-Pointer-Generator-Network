Plebgate: Former minister Andrew Mitchell was accused of having called police officers 'plebs' while leaving Downing Street on his bike

A police force has been accused of an extraordinary 11th-hour cover-up over claims three senior officers lied to blacken the name of former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell.

In an explosive letter, watchdog Deborah Glass said an internal investigation by West Mercia Police was altered at the last minute to clear them of misconduct.

On Tuesday, the Independent Police Complaints Commission suggested officers lied about what Mr Mitchell said in a private meeting about the ‘Plebgate’ row.

It said they wanted to heap pressure on him to resign over disputed claims he called Downing Street police officers ‘plebs’ during an argument at the No.10 gates.

And it concluded that the trio – Inspector Ken MacKaill, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones – should have faced misconduct hearings.

IPCC deputy chairman Miss Glass last night revealed that the first draft of an earlier West Mercia inquiry drew the same conclusion.

But within a month, the force changed its mind.

In a letter copied to the Home Secretary, Miss Glass said: ‘We had no concerns about the quality of the investigation carried out by West Mercia Police. It was the conclusion we disagreed with.

‘In that regard, I note that in the first draft report submitted to the IPCC in July the senior investigating officer did in fact conclude there was a case to answer for misconduct. Although the final report in August, did not.’

It is not clear who ordered the report to be changed or why. West Mercia Police declined to comment last night.

But one senior Tory said its Chief Constable David Shaw would have to ‘consider his position’ if it emerged he had been involved in the decision.

The Prime Minister told MPs yesterday that the conduct of the officers, who were representing the Police Federation, was ‘not acceptable’ and backed calls for Mr Shaw to apologise to Mr Mitchell. Mr Cameron said it was only thanks to a recording of the meeting by Mr Mitchell that he was able to show that ‘what the police officers said was untrue.’

Inspector MacKaill is from the West Mercia force, DS Hinton is from West Midlands and Sgt Jones is from Warwickshire.

Mr Shaw, along with the chief constables of the West Midlands and Warwickshire forces, will be grilled by MPs over the issue next week. Tory MP Richard Ottaway said all three might have to resign if they were found to have been involved in a cover-up.

He said: ‘[Mr Shaw] has to explain exactly what has happened. If it is apparent that he has been part of the change in the [report’s] conclusions then frankly I think he has got to consider his position. If [the other chief constables] were part of it as well then they are in the same position.’

The investigation by West Mercia concluded there were no grounds for a misconduct inquiry as there was ‘no deliberate intention to lie’.

But Miss Glass branded the investigation a whitewash, and warned the incident raised questions about the  ‘honesty and integrity’ of the three officers involved.

Her intervention drew an angry response from the Police Federation and the three forces.

West Midlands police and crime commissioner Bob Jones yesterday said her comments had been ‘completely unjustified’ and ‘very inappropriate’, and called for the abolition of the IPCC.

The former shadow home secretary David Davis said: ‘What the IPCC did here was trust the police, as the public do generally, and unfortunately what this demonstrates is that the police cannot be trusted, actually, to investigate themselves.

‘I’m afraid it is as plain as a pikestaff that what is happening here is the senior officers are trying to prevent their own forces from embarrassment... an attempt to stop embarrassment I’m afraid is a disgrace.’

The Crown Prosecution Service is now considering whether to bring criminal charges following a long-running police investigation into the original ‘Plebgate’ incident in September last year.

Mr Mitchell admits losing his temper and swearing after police stopped him riding his bicycle through the gates of Downing Street. But he has always denied using the word ‘plebs’, as claimed in a ‘police log’ which was leaked to the media.

Eight people, including five police officers from the Diplomatic Protection Group, were arrested.
