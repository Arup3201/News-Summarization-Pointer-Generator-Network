A disabled man died after he plunged head first down a flight of stairs in his wheelchair after drunkenly leaving through the wrong door.

Council worker David Henley had drunk ten pints with friends in a hotel but took an exit leading to six steps instead of a wheelchair ramp.

An inquest heard the 43 year-old, who was born with spina bifida, made his fatal mistake despite being a regular visitor to the Grange Moor Hotel in Maidstone, Kent.

He was found by hotel guests, but medics were unable to save him and he died from vomiting and bleeding which entered his lungs and airways.

Mr Henley, a transport officer for Kent County Council, was found to be almost three times over the legal drink-drive limit after the accident in February 2012.

He had been enjoying a drink with work colleagues when he left to meet a waiting taxi and the accident happened.

Coroner Alison Grief heard there was no sign on the door he mistakenly opened, but that did not constitute a health and safety issue.

The hotel had previously been given a clean bill of health by safety inspectors who noted that more signage to an exit ramp would be useful, but it was no major cause for concern.

Hotel director Hsaio Gibbons, said: "It was established that the hotel has met all the requirements of all the rules and regulations and was not in breach in respect of the incident.

'As to the unfortunate death of Mr Henley, it was difficult to understand what had happened.

'We and the police looked through the CCTV footage again and again but could not understand why Mr Henley didn't exit the entrance from which he arrived.

'Instead, he went through the doorway which consists of inner doors and outer doors leading to half-a-dozen steps.

'Both sets of doors are all with clear glass panels so guests can see the steps the other side of the outer doors.

'He somehow managed to open two sets of the double doors and fell down the steps.

'In any normal fall, one might suffer slight injuries as there were only six steps.

'Inexplicably, Mr Henley did not survive his fall and died at the nearby hospital a few hours later.'

Miss Grief, coroner for Mid-Kent and Medway, recorded a verdict that Mr Henley died by accident.

She said: 'I am satisfied that his death was the result of tragic circumstances following an enjoyable evening he had.'

After the inquest Mr Henley's mother Christine Henley, 65, said: 'For us the matter is closed.

'Everyone that night had a lot to drink.

'Nobody could have prevented it - it was an accident and he died after a happy evening surrounded by good friends.'
