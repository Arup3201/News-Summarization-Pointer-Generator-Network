A sixth man was arrested today in connection with an alleged sexual assault of a toddler.

It comes after officers swooped on three branches of the privately-run Bright Eyes Nurseries in Bromsgrove, Redditch and Droitwich, in Worcestershire.

Five men who either worked or had regular access to the nurseries were arrested and a sixth man was quizzed by officers yesterday.

All six men were released on police bail for two weeks pending inquiries.

Police yesterday raided three nurseries and arrested five male nursery workers after a toddler claimed they had been sexually assaulted by a member of staff. Another man has been arrested today

The raids came after a concerned mother told police last week that her child claimed they had been assaulted

Managers of Bright Eyes have closed the nurseries while police investigations into the allegations continue.

Ofsted, who rated the nursery as ‘good’ in 2010, have also suspended its registration, meaning staff cannot offer childcare.

Parents were yesterday invited to meet police at the nurseries to find out more details about the investigation.

Detective Superintendent Amanda Blakeman, of West Mercia Police, said: 'The meetings will be private and designed for the needs of the parents and guardians, who we want to be able to talk in confidence about difficult issues.

'There will be senior and specialist officers on hand to give advice, support and reassurance, such giving guidance on how to discuss sensitive issues with young children.

'Meanwhile, our criminal investigation continues at the three nurseries and we are liaising with partners such as Ofsted, Worcestershire Safeguarding Children Board and local councils about the practices at the business over recent years and whether they were up to the standards parents would expect.'

Officers searched six properties including the three nurseries after a concerned mother told police last week that her child claimed they had been assaulted at one of the nurseries.

There are 20 registered staff on the books and the nursery caters for 67 children aged between three-months and five years of age.

The nursery costs parents around £157-a-week and is open five days a week.

One parent said today: 'It is a very worrying time, everyone hopes it is an isolated incident but you just don’t know.'
