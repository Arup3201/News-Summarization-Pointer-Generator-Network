No wonder Sally Bercow looks so pleased with herself.

She and her pal Farah Sassoon are enjoying the best seats in the house for the State Opening of Parliament.

Tickets for the glittering ceremony are highly sought after but the Speaker’s wife and wealthy businesswoman Mrs Sassoon were sitting in a prime spot in the House of Lords gallery.

Last night John Bercow was accused of bringing his office of Commons Speaker into disrepute after it emerged Mrs Sassoon was given the ticket just days before she donated thousands of pounds to his re-election campaign.

The Queen set out the Government’s agenda at the occasion on June 4. Three days later, Mrs Sassoon’s conference and booking firm handed £5,000 to Mr Bercow.

The Speaker already faces questions on why Mrs Sassoon was granted a pass giving her access to the parliamentary estate.

Yesterday Mr Bercow was warned that the donation would be seen as a reminder of previous ‘cash for access’ and sleaze scandals.

Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘This raises further questions about the Speaker, but in particular his wife’s relationship with Farah Sassoon.

‘For her to be given such a lofty place at the State Opening of Parliament, mere days before she donates thousands to the Speaker’s re-election campaign, raises the spectre of past Parliamentary scandals.’

During the State Opening, Mrs Sassoon and Mrs Bercow watched as Mr Bercow paraded into the chamber with MPs before the Queen spoke. An onlooker said: ‘Sally and Farah appeared to be enjoying themselves. They were chatting away and having a joke before the ceremony started.’ 

Earlier this week, it emerged that Mrs Sassoon had been granted a pass giving her access to the parliamentary estate two years before she made the donation, which Mr Bercow has declared in the Register of Members’ Interests. 

The pass allows her to bypass airport-style security checks at the Houses of Parliament. Mr Wilson wrote to Mr Bercow to ask him why it had been granted and raised the prospect of writing to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards about the issue.

Mr Bercow said that the pass allowed Mrs Sassoon access to his grace-and-favour apartment overlooking the Thames. He stated: ‘My family is entitled to apply for security clearance for those who visit us regularly. A close personal friend of my wife holds such a pass.

‘The security pass in question does not permit that person to access the wider Parliamentary Estate unless escorted by a full pass holder.’

Mrs Sassoon came to public attention last year when she was pictured draping her leg across Mrs Bercow’s lap in a cab while on a night out after an awards ceremony.

She is married to hotelier Peter Sassoon Munns. She has given more than £40,000 to Labour.

She is listed as director of Trust Reservations, a conference and hotel booking agency, which made the donation to Mr Bercow.

One of its contracts is said to be arranging hotels for Labour delegates at party conferences.

Last night a spokesman for Mr Bercow said: ‘Farah Sassoon is a good friend of Sally Bercow. Ms Sassoon has accompanied Mrs Bercow to hear the Queen’s Speech from the West Gallery, in the House of Lords, on the previous two occasions.’

Mrs Sassoon has made clear that she does not wish to speak to the Press.
