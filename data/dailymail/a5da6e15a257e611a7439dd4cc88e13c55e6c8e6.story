The corporation's controller of comedy commissioning Shane Allen said Frankie Boyle is 'not a pariah'

He has been axed from Channel 4 and was cut from this year’s Comic Relief schedule for making a string of sick jokes.

But the BBC still wants Frankie Boyle to return to its mainstream TV channels, its new comedy boss has revealed.

The corporation’s controller of comedy commissioning Shane Allen said the controversial comic is ‘not a pariah’ and may return if the right programme emerges.

Despite admitting many viewers see him as an ‘offence machine’, he said Boyle’s comedy was ‘done with intelligence and a purpose’, adding: ‘If you’re worried about offending anyone you won’t make any comedy.’

Mr Allen also revealed he hopes to commission new special episodes of Absolutely Fabulous, saying the door is always open to the 1990s classic as it is ‘in the national fabric.’

Before joining the BBC last year, Mr Allen worked with Boyle on Channel 4 sketch show Tramadol Nights. 

The show was axed after the 40-year-old Scot joked about the autistic son of glamour model Katie Price.

Speaking at a Broadcasting Press Guild event, Mr Allen said: ‘I wouldn’t rule him out. He’s not a pariah. Look back to the 70s. Billy Connolly was an outcast. People were kicking in his gates. He was doing jokes about the crucifixion and stuff. 

‘I do think there’s offensive and horrible and nasty comedy. If it’s not done with intelligence and a purpose then I think it’s really wrong. You can’t defend it. But I do think Frankie gives us an alternative view of the world.’

Mr Allen said Twitter and other social media caused an ‘added problem’ when hiring controversial comics, because the BBC cannot control what they say online.

But he said: ‘What I think [Boyle] stands for is a libertarian mindset, not a million miles away from [BBC star] Charlie Brooker. His angst and his frustration at the world and at how flawed and imperfect we are is where Frankie’s coming from, rather than it dissipating into a nasty diatribe about horrific stuff.

‘This has been lost along the way. He is seen as this offence machine. This guy who does this horrific offensive comedy.’

He added: ‘Nobody has at yet brought forward an actual project [for Boyle]. I’m trying to find the right thing for the right people. I don’t know what Frankie would go in. I need someone to come in with a vision.’

Asked whether the BBC should be more careful than other broadcasters not to cause offence, Mr Allen said: ‘Offense is subjective. If there’s a purpose or there’s some satirical intent and it’s defendable for humour reasons, then of course you’re going to offend some people.

'Some people get offended by weird things…animal scenes generate the most amount of anger. 

‘I think when people are offended they are genuinely offended. But it’s just their internal barometer. It’s a subjective thing.

'If you’re worried about offending anyone you won’t make any comedy.’

Boyle last appeared on the BBC in 2009, when he left satirical panel game Mock the Week claiming he was ‘bored’.

Earlier this month BBC bosses were forced to axe Boyle from a Comic Relief broadcast

He caused uproar during his stint at the corporation when viewers complained a joke about the Queen was ‘sexist’ and ‘ageist’, but the BBC Trust decided he had not breached its guidelines and he was not fired.

Earlier this month, BBC bosses were forced to axe Boyle from a Comic Relief broadcast after he said he wished the Queen had died before the Diamond Jubilee.

Following his comment about Miss Price’s son Harvey and a series of offensive jokes about the Paralympic Games, Channel 4 bosses ruled out the possibility he would return to the channel.

Mr Allen also revealed he hopes Absolutely Fabulous star Jennifer Saunders is writing more episodes of the classic sit-com, following a one-off Olympics special last year.

He said: ‘The door’s always open for more Ab Fab. She is brilliant. Ab Fab is in the national fabric.

'The door is wide open. She probably isn’t [writing more now] but we want her to be. It would be specials [rather than a series].’
