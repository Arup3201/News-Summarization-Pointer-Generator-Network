Glam grand slam: Leah Totton appears to have given her past come cosmetic surgery

There's no denying  the glamorous blonde Apprentice winner Leah Totton is a great advertisement for the chain of Botox clinics she intends to set up.

Nicknamed Dr Totty, the 25-year-old doctor from Northern Ireland hopes her new business will leave her customers with smooth foreheads and her with fat profits.

Just days after being named as Lord Sugar’s latest Apprentice on the BBC show, she is hard at work establishing a chain of Dr Leah cosmetic clinics with the £250,000 she received from her formidable backer.

But already she has faced a backlash from those who believe she lacks the expertise and experience needed to perform or oversee the anti-ageing treatments she plans to offer.

So, it must be interesting for Leah’s detractors to learn her local newspaper, the Londonderry Sentinel, published a story in February, before The Apprentice aired, that wrote in glowing terms of her skills.

The article reported Miss Totton had set up a company called LT Medical, a team of ‘leading skin rejuvenation specialists’ who worked with clients to ‘achieve their aesthetic dreams’.

Apparently, her clinics had been so successful in England that she was planning to expand into Northern Ireland.

LT Medical, readers were informed, was ‘led by a team of dedicated UK doctors’.

The company offered ‘a wide range of aesthetic treatments, including anti- wrinkle injections, facial fillers, lip enhancement and skin peels’.

How extraordinary then that the Mail’s attempts to locate LT Medical, its premises, any one of those dedicated UK doctors, a website or even a phone number were this week met with a blank.

There is no such company registered with Companies House and no listing for it at the Care Quality Commission, the independent regulator of health and social care services.

Naturally, you expect a cosmetic surgery clinic to be discreet, but surely not invisible? In an attempt to seek more information about LT Medical, I contacted Frank PR, which represents Miss Totton.

However, a spokesman would only say: ‘Previous to being on The Apprentice, Leah had set up a trading name in Belfast as she always had in mind what she is going to do now with Lord Sugar.

‘Now she’s won the show, this brand is not something she will be pursuing. Going forward, her focus will be solely on developing the Dr Leah brand.’

Face-off: Miss Totton beat Luisa Zissman to win The Apprentice and Sir Alan Sugar's £250,000 investment in her cosmetic surgery business

While the whereabouts of LT Medical remains a mystery, it turns out the newspaper’s information for the story, I am told, was supplied to a reporter by Miss Totton herself.

This brings us to the latest company, Dr Leah. At the outset, Lord Sugar seemed doubtful about Miss Totton’s business proposition. He wasn’t all that impressed — who would be? — with her suggested name for the company: NIKS (skin spelt backwards). The name Dr Leah was his idea.

He was also worried about the ethics of cosmetic surgery. But eventually he was won round to the idea and picked Miss Totton over fellow finalist Luisa Zissman, who baked cupcakes.

One insider at the BBC says that Lord Sugar was ‘rather taken’ with Miss Totton. ‘She’s very much a man’s woman. She’s tough and ambitious, but softer around men, and was all feminine and charm around Lord Sugar.

‘He seemed to be quite impressed with her appearance and would help her when she made mistakes.’

And the source says Miss Totton liked 
to look her best at all times. ‘During filming she was always looking in
  the mirror and talking about camera angles.

‘She was paranoid for some reason about going out in sunlight, as though she was worried she might melt or something.’

Is this an indication that Miss Totton has had ‘work’ done herself — research, you could say, for the job ahead?

Firm favourite: A BBC insider said Lord Sugar was 'rather taken' with Dr Leah

She says not. ‘I can 100 per cent verify I have not had any treatment done,’ she says.

‘I don’t have wrinkles. I’m only 25 and they’re not treatments that are aimed at my age group.

‘They’re anti-ageing treatments and at 25, certainly no — I have not had any. And I’m not looking to have any in the near future.’

TV critics have been underwhelmed by this series of The Apprentice and have described it as ‘a load of old Botox’. One critic said Lord Sugar had got  it wrong by choosing the ‘butcher’ (Dr Leah) over the ‘baker’ (cupcake queen Luisa). At first glance, it may appear Sugar himself thinks so, too.

As well as investing £250,000 in the Dr  Leah chain, it had been assumed he would also become a director, take shares in the company — and a cut of the profits.

He is, for example, a director of Aventom, the company set up by a previous Apprentice winner, Thomas Pellereau, and owns 100 of Aventom’s 200 shares.

But so far Miss Totton is the only director of Dr Leah and owns all the company’s 100 shares.

Surely Lord Sugar is not being cautious in case the cynics who can visualise pictures of women in the papers under the headlines ‘Dr Leah gave  me a trout pout’ are proved right? 

Not at all, say Lord Sugar’s PR. 

He insists the delay is simply procedural and he will soon become a director and own half of the company.

There is no denying Miss Totton’s intelligence and drive. Before deciding she wanted to go into the cosmetic surgery business, she trained to become a doctor, at  considerable expense to the public purse. Raised in Londonderry, one of three children to her mother Lorraine and father, Trevor, who works for a communications company, Leah was, by all accounts, an extraordinarily bright child.

She attended Lisnagelvin primary school, and Foyle and Londonderry College, which she left  with straight As and an array of prizes.

From there, Leah moved to Norwich to 
study medicine. While at university she went out with footballer Fraser 
Forster, who was on loan at Norwich from Newcastle before signing for 
Celtic.

The relationship is
 now over. One associate says Miss Totton, who became known during that 
time as a minor WAG, may have ended it because ‘he wasn’t famous enough 
as a footballer for her’.

But who knows, as Mr Forster did congratulate her on winning The Apprentice, which suggests he holds no grudge.

Miss Totton graduated in 2011 with a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MB BS).

After
 leaving university, Leah says she did further training in aesthetic 
medicine in Harley Street. The details are vague; what course she did is
 not clear.

Careful image: Leah Totton's company LT Medical was reportedly so successful in England she was expanding to Northern Ireland - but it appears never to have existed

During the filming of The Apprentice, she worked in A&E at Newham General Hospital in East London.

She has tweeted several times about having done the night shift in between filming — testament to her dedication to her profession.

However, building a cosmetics empire and doing the night shift at A&E are not compatible with each another. One job had to go — no prizes for guessing which one.

Acquaintances say Miss Totton aims not just to become a successful businesswoman, but rich and famous, too — a ‘celebrity’.

‘She’s already talking about cracking America, which seems a bit premature,’ says one.

Miss Totton insists she wants to set up Dr Leah clinics because she is concerned about the lack of regulation in the cosmetic surgery industry and wants to ‘provide a safe environment for women to undergo these treatments’.

‘I don’t see it as moving over to the dark side, I see it as medicalising the dark side and casting light onto it,’ she says.

‘Young women of 25 don’t need Botox. And I am a very moral person, so I would have no hesitation in saying that to a member of the public who came to me for non-surgical treatment.’

It’s not clear whether Miss Totton plans to carry out procedures herself or to take a purely managerial role. Plastic surgeons have warned that she doesn’t have the skills to carry out procedures.

‘She may have done a few weeks’ training in aesthetic medicine, but that is simply not enough,’ says consultant plastic surgeon Nigel Mercer, a former chairman of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons.

‘It may not be quite as dangerous as putting a hairdresser in charge of cosmetic surgery, but it is still putting patients at risk.’

But Miss Totton insists her clinics are going  to be professional and ethical, operated by trained staff who won’t give clients a trout pout, frozen eyebrows or a wonky smile.

She has a wealth of experience behind her, after all, with that mysterious cosmetics empire of hers — LT Medical.
