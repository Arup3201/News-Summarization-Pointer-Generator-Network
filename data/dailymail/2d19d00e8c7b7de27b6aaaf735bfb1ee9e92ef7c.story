Engineers have told how they were sent to David Cameron’s house on New Year’s Day to fix his power after he suffered a blackout while watching The Sound of Music on TV.

The callout to the Prime Minister’s home in Chipping Norton happened as workmen battled to restore electricity to 11,000 houses in Oxfordshire during the severe storms earlier this month.

Two engineers from Scottish and Southern Energy Power Distribution claimed they were sent to Mr Cameron’s address while carrying out emergency repairs in Kirtlington, a village 17 miles away.

But when the workers - George Faulkner
 and Alan Paton - arrived, they allegedly found the blackout was not 
related to the storms, and that the trip switch in his fuse box simply 
needed to be flicked.

Mr 
Paton told BBC Radio 4: ‘We could have been employed on better things 
but we got called out to a property where the trip had gone that they 
obviously hadn’t checked properly.

‘They
 thought it was the storms and they phoned in and said they were off 
supply. So we went there for nothing really... There was nothing wrong 
with their mains.’

Mr 
Cameron’s house had been suffering from a leaky roof, and water was seen 
around the fusebox, reported the Sunday Mirror.

An SSE spokesman insisted the politician did not 
receive preferential treatment because of his status - and the visit was not to the detriment of any other customers who may have been without power.

High winds over Christmas also left 250,000 homes without power, with some families waiting days for the electricity to be restored - something criticised as ‘not acceptable’ by Mr Cameron.

The SSE spokesman told MailOnline: ‘The Prime Minister did not receive any preferential treatment when we attended his property.

'And further, this visit was not to the detriment of any other customers who may have been without power. To suggest otherwise would be absolutely false.'

A Number 10 spokesman told the Sunday Mirror: ‘The power went down because there was a leaky roof. There was water around the fusebox. The engineers came to fix it, which they did.’

Mr Cameron told The Sunday Times of the power cut: ‘I couldn't work out what it was. The power went off just before the end of The Sound of Music. But I know what happens, so it's all right.’
