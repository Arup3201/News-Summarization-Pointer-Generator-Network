Alan Irvine admits West Bromwich Albion have been handed a run-in from hell by the fixture computer but is aiming to replicate Crystal Palace’s thriving finish in similar circumstances last season as he takes control at the Hawthorns.

The new head coach has challenged his players to get the club to safety as quickly as possible so the final five matches against Liverpool, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Chelsea and Arsenal are rendered largely inconsequential.

West Brom’s run-in echoes that endured by Norwich City last season when they faced Liverpool, United, Chelsea and Arsenal and collected only one point and were relegated.

Safety first: New West Brom boss Alan Irvine wants to secure points before a difficult run-in

But Irvine wants his players to channel Palace, who beat Chelsea and Everton, among others, and came back from 3-0 down to snatch a draw with Liverpool as the season reached a climax.

‘It’s the Premier League so straight away there are an awful lot of very, very tough games,’ he said.

‘It’s a difficult end to the season that’s for sure, but you’ve got to play everyone anyway.

‘Getting safe before then would be helpful that’s for sure. But that’s what you’ d be aiming to do. You want to be in a really good place as quickly as possible.

‘You look at Palace’s end to the season as opposed to Norwich’s and of course they produced some outstanding results against the top teams.’

Irvine is already under pressure from fans angry at his appointment, given his two previous managerial roles – at Preston North End and Sheffield Wednesday – were not in the Premier League and ended with the sack.

But the 55-year-old, who moves from head of Everton’s academy, defended his standing in the game. ‘I understand I wouldn’t have been the name of everybody lips but I’ve got this job now,’ he said. ‘I know the Albion fans are incredibly passionate but I’m incredibly passionate – hopefully together we can have success.

‘The only way I can do that is by winning games. Every single manager or head coach will be judged on results on the pitch. Unfortunately that won’t happen for a number of weeks but it does give me time to work with the players and get them ready. My passion is for coaching.’

He will also need to work quickly in the transfer market with West Brom’s squad threadbare. ‘We’ve got 16 players and three of them are goalkeepers so that won’ t be enough for a Premier League season,’ he said.

‘We have to get more players in. We have some good players in the squad but it needs to be supplemented.

‘There aren’t any fullbacks at the club, a shortage of wide players, we have three senior centre-backs, we don’t have a lot of senior strikers. There are areas we need to address but it’s got to be quality.’
