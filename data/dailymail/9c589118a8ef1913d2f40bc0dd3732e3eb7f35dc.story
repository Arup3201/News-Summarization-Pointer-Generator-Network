Sex offences on Britain's railway network have soared by 21 per cent in just 12 months, reveal latest crime figures.

British Transport Police said the huge year-on-year increase was partly caused by high-profile prosecutions of celebrities such as Max Clifford for historic sex offences.

There were 1,117 incidents of sexual 
offences recorded by British Transport Police (BTP) in 2013/14 (the 12 
months ending March 2014) - a 20.8 per cent increase on the 925 in 2012/13.

Most of the increase was accounted 
for by incidents of sexual crime against females, which rose from 485 in
 2012/13 to 624 in 2013/14.

Disgraced PR guru Clifford was jailed for eight years for a string of sexual offences in May.

BTP
 chiefs said cases like his have 'undoubtedly' given victims more confidence 
to come forward. The force said a BTP-led initiative, called Project 
Guardian, had also had a 'significant' impact in London.

BTP said: 'Part of this increase can 
be attributed to the high-profile prosecutions of celebrities for 
historical offences which have, undoubtedly, given victims more 
confidence to come forward.'

BTP Chief Constable Paul Crowther said: 'Project Guardian, a joint initiative between BTP, Metropolitan Police Service Safer Transport Command, City of London Police and Transport for London, focuses on increasing awareness and confidence amongst the public to report unwanted sexual behaviour to the police or members of staff.

'We are particularly interested in those offences which are often unreported, such as sexual assault, exposure, outraging public decency, lewd comments and harassment.'

Overall crime on Britain's railways has fallen for the tenth year in a row, according to BTP statistics.

Notifiable
 crime - which makes up the more serious offences dealt with by the 
Force - fell by six per cent during 2013/14 - meaning there were more 
than 3,000 fewer victims of crime than the previous year.

There were 1,117 incidents of sexual offences recorded by British Transport Police (BTP) in 2013/14 (the 12 months ending March 2014) - a 20.8% increase on the 925 in 2012/13.

Most of the increase was accounted for by incidents of sexual crime against females, which rose from 485 in 2012/13 to 624 in 2013/14.

Sexual crime against males rose from 27 in 2012/13 to 42 in 2013/14 while cases of exposure increased from 141 to 148, with incidents of other sexual crime going up from 272 to 303.

BTP said the increase in sexual offences was slightly higher than that experienced by police forces nationally.

Covering England, Wales and Scotland, the BTP figures showed that overall for 2013/14, notifiable crime, which makes up the more serious offences dealt with by BTP, fell by 5.7% from 53,885 to 50,840 - meaning there were more than 3,000 fewer victims of crime than in 2012/13.

Chief
 Constable Crowther said notable achievements included a reduction of 18
 per cent in recorded robberies, a 17 per cent drop in theft of 
passenger property and a 37 per cent fall in theft of cable from the 
railway.

He added: 
'The initiatives and operations which have made such an impact during 
the past 12 months really highlight the advantage our specialist 
knowledge brings to the railway.

'By working 
with the rail companies and passengers, we are able to truly understand 
the challenges they face and devise innovative solutions to tackle those
 problems.'

In 2012 theft of passenger property was highlighted by both passengers and train operators as a growing concern, as thieves turned to trains and stations which offered supposed easy pickings.

In response BTP launched Operation Magnum, an awareness campaign which drew on the knowledge and experience of rail officers and staff to advise passengers about the most common tactics used by thieves - as well as tips to avoid falling victim.

Chief Constable Crowther said: 'We have led the way in combating theft and there can be little doubt that Operation Magnum, which was driven by online content and social media, has had the desired effect with almost 3,000 fewer people falling victim to this type of crime year-on-year.

'During 2013/14 we also continued to spearhead efforts to tackle metal and cable theft both on the railway, and in other sectors, through the National Metal Theft Taskforce - bringing about a 37 per cent fall in railway cable theft which, in turn, significantly reduced the delays and disruption faced by the railway as a result of criminal activity.'

The Chief Constable, who was appointed in May this year, added: 'For the coming months and years we will have one simple goal - to make sure everyone who travels or works on the railway can get home everyday, safe, secure and on time.'
