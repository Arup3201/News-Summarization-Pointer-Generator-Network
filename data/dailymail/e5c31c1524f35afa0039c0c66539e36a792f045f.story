It's the Belgian Grand Prix weekend. The sound of the Ferrari engines are rhythmic in my ear as I look across the track and the Francorchamps landscape, while my heart is beating at around 140 beats per minute. This must be what a Formula One driver feels like.

But as news filters in on Thursday about a soon-to-be dramatic race weekend, I am made aware of two special features on this course, snow and a neon rave. This is not Spa.

Instead, I am taking on an experiment Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen  took part in earlier that morning. Two laps around Shell's specially designed circuit, with excitement metres and hearbeat sensors connected.

Changeable conditions: Shell's special test track for the 'Science of Driving' experiment

Ready to go: Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso have their excitement levels tested using skin conductance

Neon rave, or a race track? The tunnel we would be passing through on our laps

Sportsmail were invited to this secret test track, just a stone's throw from the famous circuit, to truly appreciate Shell's long-standing partnership with Ferrari. 

£250,000 Toys were provided in the shape of an F12 Berlinetta and the 458 Speciale, but the results of mine and the two former world champion's experiences in truth couldn't be more different.

An F1 driver's heartbeat rests at around 40BPM (no wonder Kimi's so cool), while they have to be extraordinarily fit to keep up a rate of around 170 on race day. By the end of today mine would have fluctuated between 70 and 150.

Ferrari test drivers Marc Gene and Andrea Bertolini would be our pilots today as we look to uncover the Shell V-Power 'most exciting driving experience'. As I step foot into the 458 Bertolini is clearly more used to this than I am.

'This is really fun,' he says, grinning from ear to ear. Aren't these guys used to this? 'Shell always give us great events, but this is something else.' He tells me to wait and see.

Fast and furious: We tried out the 458 Speciale with Ferrari test driver Andrea Bertolini

Contrast: Ok, so Kimi Raikkonen may pull off the Ferrari look better than me...

The thrill is something else. While I am soon to be made a fool by Kimi and Fernando, the  two laps are exhilarating.

The Le Mans specialist is laughing as he drifts round a corner covered in snow, while my excitement percentage rises as we pass through the tunnel.

The back-end of the 458 kicks out round sharp corners after using most of that V8 engine, one that is 'technically' more powerful than those being used in this year's F1 championship.

Watching Alonso and Raikkonen take on their laps later makes me realise just how 'cool' these drivers are. They are paid a huge amount of money, yes, but they risk their lives week-in, week-out for their employers. To see them flicker a smile as they are presented with this custom-made track reminds you that this is their playground, their life. They're born to drive. Me, I'm just a passenger.

'Thanks to Shell, I now know to go looking for tunnels when I’m not on the track.' Räikkönen said.

Life of a Formula One driver: These guys really know how to play it cool... week in, week out

As my lap finishes I am told more about Shell's partnership, and in particular their fuel technology. We are told that a version of V-Power Nitro is '99 per cent' the same as the 'Super Unleaded' fuel anyone can pick up today, so much so that we are told a Formula One car's performance wasn't drastically altered by using 'normal' fuel. Time to pretend you're an F1 driver.

Shell have been the power behind the Ferrari at Grand Prix's since 1947, making it one of the most enduring partnerships in the sport. That much is clear throughout the race weekend, with Alonso and Raikkonen not shy to praise their contribution.

It hasn't been the best of year's on the track for the motorsport giant but plans are certainly in place for next season. Approximately 21,000 hours of testing are put into just the fuel alone, and we are shown certain features in an on-site track lab. Despite the season's form suggesting otherwise,  Alonso is bullish when assessing his chances for the weekend.

Making the most of it: Alonso said he always believes he can win, no matter what car Ferrari give him

'Mercedes obviously have the advantage,' he admits. 'But when I get in that car, I always think I can win.' These drivers aren't short of confidence.

The Ferrari duo weren't overly unhappy with qualifying (rumours were Kimi was seen as a push to make it through to Q2), while their race pace was generally encouraging.

And hey, despite the two contrasting personalities, there has yet to be a public fall-out between the pair. Shell found a place to let these spirits free.

Maybe if Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton were to race round Shell's track, they'd start to have some fun together too.
