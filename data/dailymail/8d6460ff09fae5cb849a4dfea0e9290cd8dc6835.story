A mother  was accidentally charged more than £270,000 for two meals after having a quick bite to eat in a restaurant. 

Pretima Champaneri-Phillips and her 17-year-old son Aaron almost left the Cote Brasserie in Hampstead, north London, without realising they had been charged 10,0000 times the intended amount.

After noticing the staggering amount on the receipt - which should have been £26.83 - the mother got the payment reversed, but says she didn't even get an apology from the manager.

Shocking mistake: Pretima Champaneri-Phillips was accidentally charged more than £270,000 for two meals at Cote Brasserie in Hampstead, north London

Ms Champaneri-Phillips was relieved after the payment was cancelled before it could clear out her bank account. 

She said: 'I had coq au vin and he had a steak. We only drank tap water. I was in shock. The meal was good, but not that good.'

The financial consultant, 52, reckons her Friday night blunder should serve as a warning for others to always check their bill fully before paying.

She added: 'It was surreal. No manager came over to explain or apologise. It left a bad taste and I won't be going back there.

'It's a warning to everyone to always check their bill closely.'

A Cote spokesman said: 'We do apologise. Luckily the lady noticed so it was cancelled.

Even if she had pressed enter, that amount would never have gone through.'
