Arsene Wenger is not afraid to spend big to ensure Arsenal challenge for the Premier League title next season, according to the club's chief executive.

The Gunners ended their nine-year trophy drought last month when they beat Hull in the FA Cup final at Wembley.

And Ivan Gazidis revealed the club are making progress in the transfer market.

'Transfers are obviously important and we are deep in conversations already. I am confident we will add what we need this summer,' he said.

'The manager is not scared to spend, has the experience, but as always will have to juggle a set budget.

'We are all really pleased with securing Champions League qualification again. Last season was a great experience for players to win the FA Cup and now we want more.'

Strike it rich: Arsenal have long been targeting Real Madrid forward Alvaro Morata

Arsenal are interested in bringing Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata to the Emirates but will not make  a move for Barcelona's Cesc Fabregas.

The Spanish midfielder is set for a £27million move to Chelsea, rather than an emotional return to north London.

Wenger is also interested in Paris Saint-Germain forward Jean-Christophe Bahebeck and highly-rated full back Serge Aurier from Toulouse.
