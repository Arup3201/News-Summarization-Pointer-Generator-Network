Fixed Odds Betting Terminals  allow users to spend up to £100 a go and are blamed for a  rise in gambling

Betting machines dubbed the ‘crack cocaine of gambling’ could spread to arcades and service stations as part of proposals from the amusement industry.

Ministers are under pressure to allow the machines – which are currently only allowed in betting shops – to be more widespread.

Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) are casino-style games which allow users to spend up to £100 a spin and are blamed for a worrying rise in problem gambling.

They generate more than half of bookmakers’ profits. However they have been subject to greater restrictions since April, when new rules meant anyone wanting to spend over £50 must inform staff.

Now BACTA, which represents the British amusement industry, is lobbying to be allowed to host the machines.

In a letter to MPs and peers, the trade body says if the Government has not cracked down on the terminals, then they should be allowed in ‘any regulated adult-only gambling establishment’. 

It adds that it is ‘unfair’ to let betting shops reap all the benefits from the profitable machines.

‘The current situation... makes no sense and gives the bookmakers an unfair advantage,’ BACTA says. 

‘If the Government deems [£50] a safe limit for bookmakers there is no reason that it is not safe for everybody.’

Campaigners say the amusement industry would have a strong case on competition grounds.

There are around 33,000 FOBTs in the UK, but Adrian Parkinson, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said this move could add another 8,000.

Ministers are under pressure to allow the machines – which are currently only allowed in betting shops – to be more widespread across the UK after BACTA started lobbying for them to feature in the amusement industry

‘How can the Government say, ‘No’ when they are saying to bookies that it is OK to have them?’ he said.

BACTA confirmed its position but did not wish to comment further.

A spokesman from the Department for Culture Media and Sport said: ‘The rules around where FOBTs can be based are very clear and they will not be moving into other areas.’
