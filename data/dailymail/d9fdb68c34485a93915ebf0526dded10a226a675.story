Reading must dust themselves down and turn their attention back to league matters when they host Brighton in the npower Championship on Tuesday night.

The Royals face an FA Cup quarter-final replay against Bradford next week following Saturday's goalless draw in Yorkshire.

But before that Steve Clarke's side must attempt to ease any fears of being sucked into the Championship relegation battle with two tough matches, the midweek visit of the Seagulls followed by a trip to promotion-chasing Watford on Saturday.

'Between now and the replay there's two important games for both sides,' said Clarke.

'We want the same resolve and desire on Tuesday night, and hopefully a couple of goals and three points.'

Clarke must decide whether to risk centre-half Alex Pearce, who suffered a broken nose in the bruising encounter at Valley Parade.

'I was delighted with the attitude from the players, it was top class,' added Clarke.

'I thought it was typified by our captain coming back on with a broken nose, nothing was going to stop him. His nose is miles over here somewhere. But he went back on, a proper centre-half.

'It would have been easy to say "I'm not going back on", but no, Alex said "patch me up, straighten it later" and he was straight back on the pitch.'

Clarke said that Pearce's attitude typified his side and urged more of the same against Brighton on Tuesday

Brighton, a point and a place below Reading in 19th, will be without striker Sam Baldock who looks set to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury.

Kazenga LuaLua is likely to come into the starting line-up in Baldock's absence and the winger expects a stern test against the Royals.

'It's going to be a tough game for us, but every match is going to be tough now,' he told the club website.

'Reading are not far from where we are in the league, but it's still going to be a very difficult game.

'They've a powerful team that has a lot of pace and they've got some good wingers as well. With the squad they have, they may feel they should be in a higher position, but this league is very tough and competitive.'
