Joy: The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby described the future monarch as an 'amazing gift'

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will go through ‘great times and tough times’ as they raise their baby son, the Archbishop of Canterbury said yesterday.

Speaking ahead of tomorrow’s royal christening, the Most Rev Justin Welby said three-month-old Prince George was ‘an amazing gift’ for proud parents William and Kate.

The Queen, Prince Charles and other senior members of the Royal Family are expected to join the couple at the private ceremony, which will be led by the Archbishop at the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace in London.

Prince Harry and Kate’s family - parents Carole and Michael Middleton and her siblings Pippa and James - are also expected to attend but the Princess Royal and the Countess of Wessex have been omitted from the 60-strong guest list.

William and Kate, both 31, were said to want an ‘intimate’ ceremony with their family and friends, and there has been speculation that the godparents will be close friends rather than grandees.

Prince Harry’s girlfriend Cressida Bonas, 24, is not understood to be among the guests and it is not known if Pippa’s stockbroker boyfriend Nico Jackson will attend.

The Archbishop said Prince George’s birth in July had prompted an ‘extraordinary’ celebration around the world.

He said: ‘We celebrate, first of all, the joy of the parents. It is a wonderful thing, having a baby. All babies are unbelievably special, not only royal babies.’ He added: ‘One of the things I’m sure about is that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince George’s parents have had so much advice that they could probably fill a house with it.

‘My message to them would be, what a treat, what an amazing gift, what wonderful times that you will have.

‘There will be great times and tough times, there always are with children.’ The Archbishop said he would baptise Prince George by splashing his head three times with water rather than by dipping his head into the font.

His five-minute film about baptism has been put on YouTube and the Lambeth Palace website in the hope that George’s christening will lead other couples to consider having their children baptised.

A similar film about the significance of marriage, recorded by Lord Williams of Oystermouth before William and Kate’s wedding, received 2.15million views on YouTube.

Their baby son will be christened George Alexander Louis at the Chapel Royal at St James’s - the Tudor chapel used for the lying-in-state of William’s mother, Diana Princess of Wales, after her death in Paris in 1997.

The chapel was also the venue for Kate’s confirmation into the Church of England in 2011, in a secret ceremony before her marriage.

Built by Henry VIII in 1531, it has a ceiling decorated by Hans Holbein to honour the monarch’s short-lived fourth marriage to Anne of Cleves.

The heart of Mary Tudor was laid beneath its chancel step in 1558 and thirty years later Elizabeth I said her prayers for the defence of the realm against the Spanish Armada in the chapel’s Royal Closet.

Charles I received Holy Communion in the chapel before his 1649 execution and Queen Victoria married Prince Albert there in 1840.

The most recent royal christening to take place there was that of Princess Beatrice in 1988 and William attended the service with his mother.

William himself was christened in the Music Room at Buckingham Palace, as was his father the Prince of Wales. Prince Harry was christened at St George’s Chapel, Windsor.

Following the service, official photographs are expected to include the first picture of the Queen with Princes Charles, William and George - the first time a reigning monarch has been pictured with three heirs since Queen Victoria.
