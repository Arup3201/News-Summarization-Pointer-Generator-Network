Capturing stunning photos lit with the perfect lighting is hard enough when you’re holding the camera, let alone when you’re controlling it remotely via a drone.

With this in mind, photo-sharing site Dronestagram wanted to reward the photography skills of drone enthusiasts with its first aerial photo contest. 

Judges and sponsors, including National Geographic and GoPro, have now selected the winners - and first prize went to a magnificent aerial shot of an eagle soaring over a national park in Indonesia.

The contest was run by Dronestagram and first prize went to Dendi Pratam for his image of an eagle soaring over Bali Barat National Park (pictured) in Indonesia. Dronestagram is a photo-sharing site that geographically tags images taken by drones around the world. Judges and sponsors included National Geographic and GoPro

‘Picking winners was a very difficult task especially because of the great quality of the photos that have been submitted,’ explained the site.

‘We tried to reward the photos that show the fantastic potential offered by drones in terms of image. It’s been an amazing first edition with many photos entered from everywhere in the world.’

Judge's Choice Award

The first prize winner was Dendi Pratam from Yogyakarta, Indonesia, registered under the username Capungaero.

His drone captured an eagle from above as the bird soared over Bali Barat National Park in Pratam’s home country.

Pratam said he noticed the eagle was chasing the drone, but rather than attack it, the bird was playing with it.

Second place went to Jericsaniel, or Jericho Saniel Lunario, from the Philippines.

His image captured an aerial shot of cyclists, joggers and visitors to a park in Caloocan City in Manila. He used a DJI Phantom drone fitted with a GoPro Hero 3 camera.

Saniel Lunario said: ‘I was flying in the park one Sunday morning when suddenly people became really interested in my drone. Looking at this picture, I realised how happy my drone made these people.

Third place went to Dominique Reginensi Reignier-Esery, Haute-Savoie. Her shot (pictured) shows a sunset over Annecy in France and captures the moment the sun pierces the castle in the old town region. This caused the light to produce a rainbow of colours on the bridge in the foreground
