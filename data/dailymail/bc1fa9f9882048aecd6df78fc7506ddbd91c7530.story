Two U.S. Embassy military attaches wounded at a strip joint in Venezuela may have shot each other, a club employee has said.

Officers heard shots around 4.25am on Tuesday at the Antonella 2012 club in Caracas, better known as 'Angelus' in the upscale Chacao district, local police said.

Today, it was revealed the pair may have been fighting each other before at least one of them drew a gun.

Violence: Three Americans were reportedly involved in a brawl outside the Antonella 2012 strip club in an upscale neighborhood of Caracas early Tuesday

Deisy Ron, who oversees performers at
 the club, said staff working on the night of the shooting told her the 
men had begun arguing inside the club.

'They were fighting with each other,' she said. 'One of them pulled out a gun and shot the other in the stomach and the leg.'

She said she did not know how the second American was wounded.

An employee had told Agence 
France-Presse that the the bar is a strip club that only admits men over
 age 30. Pictures of female strippers line the entrance to the club.

One
 of the embassy employees, military attach√© Roberto Ezequiel Rosas, was 
shot in the leg, according to a police report seen by Reuters and the 
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The second embassy official, Paul Marwin, was shot in the stomach but did not notice the injury until arriving home, the source said.

The wounds are not believed to be life-threatening.

A police source told AFP that a third American was involved, as well, but he was not wounded.

The
 shooting happened just outside the strip club after the Americans got 
into an argument with other patrons of the nightclub, police say.

'Apparently
 it was a fight originating in a nightspot where these people were 
attacked and shots were fired at them and they suffered gunshot wounds,'
 police spokesman Douglas Rico told Venezuelan TV channel Globovision.

In a terse statement, the embassy confirmed an 'incident,' but gave few details.

'We can confirm that two members of the U.S. Embassy in Caracas were injured during an incident early this morning. Medical staff informs us that their injuries do not appear to be life-threatening,' the statement said.

On Tuesday afternoon, Reuters reporters saw police detective vehicles parked near the club, which is popular among foreigners. Officials walked in and out of the club without answering questions.

Venezuela has one of the world's highest homicide rates. Violent crime occurs primarily in the country's poor slums, but in recent years, assaults and shootings have become more common in well-to-do areas of the city.

Last week, President Nicolas Maduro launched a security drive that puts soldiers on the streets of the capital. About 20 security initiatives have been implemented since 1999.

The Venezuela shooting may revive memories of an incident that embarrassed U.S. officials in Colombia last year. In that case, Secret Service agents helping to protect President Barack Obama were sent home for involvement with prostitutes.
