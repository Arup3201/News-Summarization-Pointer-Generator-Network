A riot erupted at a Groundhog Day party in Russia after guests realised their host was planning to cook a marmot - and then serve it with cranberry sauce.

The showbiz bash - held in Moscow - featured the marmot, which had been brought in as 'the star of the show' from a local children's petting zoo.

A host of Russian celebrities happily posed with the creature, a relative of the squirrel, as they arrived at the charity event in aid of underprivileged children.

The showbiz bash - held in the Russian capital Moscow - featured the marmot, which had been brought in as 'the star of the show' from a local children's petting zoo

But the guests were left with a very bad taste in their mouths when organiser Aleksey Polihun, 35, announced that he was about to kill and then cook the groundhog before serving it up on platter in a cranberry sauce. 

He said he wanted to kill and cook it as he thought it would be 'entertaining to have a groundhog which didn't survive groundhog day'. 

Groundhog Day is traiditonally held on February 2, when legend has it that if the rodent sees his shadow, winter will last another six weeks. If not, spring comes early.

It is not clear why the party was being held so long after the official Groundhog Day. 

Guest Marya Nekrasova, 26, said: 'It was outrageous.

'The poor thing was terrified... and it may be hard to believe but some people actually cheered him on.'

The groundhog day special cake. One of the guests in the end offered to buy the animal off the menu and took it back to the zoo

She added: 'One of the other guests in the end offered to buy it off the menu and took it back to the zoo.'

In the hit Groundhog Day movie, star Bill Murray is forced to live the same 24 hours over and over again while he is in a small town to report on a marmot said to be able to predict the future. 

Polihun said later: 'It's a pity. I think it would have been very tasty.

'A bit like rabbit but with more zing to it.'

He added: 'In the end most people thought I should let him live, so I did.

'I just thought it would be entertaining to have a groundhog who didn't actually survive groundhog day.'
