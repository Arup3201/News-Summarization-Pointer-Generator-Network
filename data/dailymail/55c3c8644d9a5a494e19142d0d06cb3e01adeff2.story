They do say two heads are better than one, but workers at a turtle farm in the U.S. had never before seen anything like this.

A two-headed snapping turtle has been discovered at the Northeast Ark Turtle Farm, in Amagon, Arkansas, in a shipment of 30,000 of the reptiles shipped from China.

The baby turtle is yet to be named, but representatives at the farm have confirmed they will be looking for a new home for the young reptile.

The baby turtle was discovered at the farm last week, according to The Jonesboro Sun.

A state biologist has said turtle mutations are rare, but are becoming more common. 

Workers at the farm have previously discovered a hatchling with one neck and two heads, but that died at birth.

Turtles from the farm are usually sold for educational and research purposes, an employee said.

The two-headed baby, however, will probably be sold to a collector. 

Earlier this year it was reported that a two-headed mutant snake had been spotted slithering its way through a village in India.

The snake, which was believed to be a checkered keelback, was seen crawling past a house in Burdwan, West Bengal.

The non-venomous snake slithered onto Apurba Ghosh's patio, leaving him just enough time to capture the magical moment on his camera phone.

And in a flash it was gone, wriggling into a bush before he had a chance to catch it. It was never seen again.
