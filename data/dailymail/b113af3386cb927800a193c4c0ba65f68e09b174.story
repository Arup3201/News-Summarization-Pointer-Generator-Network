A Gael Kakuta impersonator has racked up almost £15,000 worth of bills at luxury hotels and nightclubs across the country by pretending to be the Chelsea loanee.

Medi Abalimba, 25, posed as the French winger while booking into the five-star Mandarin Oriental hotel in Hyde Park, but was subsequently caught by police after they found his fingerprints on a pair of Harvey Nichols shoes the fraudster had attempted to give out as a tip.

Abalimba, a former Liverpool reserve player, also racked up a £9,600 tab at Corinthia in Whitehall and the Millennium Knightsbridge while running up a £5,000 bill at a club in Manchester.

Kakuta has been at Chelsea since 2007 but has found first team opportunities limited 

The conman admitted five counts of fraud and is currently in custody in Manchester as he awaits his sentencing next month.

Kakuta is now on his sixth loan spell away from Chelsea after agreeing a move to Rayo Vallecano in the summer.
