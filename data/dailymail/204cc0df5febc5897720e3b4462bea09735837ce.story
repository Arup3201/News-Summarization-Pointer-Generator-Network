Prowling through the fields the fearsome feline patrols his hunting ground, pausing only occasionally to preen his luxuriant ginger mane.

But hopefully this time domestic 
cat  Teddy Bear, who has been blamed for inadvertently triggering Britain’s biggest safari hunt in living memory 
by being mistaken for a lion, will be allowed to saunter off in peace.

The
 three-year-old pet – a Maine Coon which can weigh up to 25lb, be up to 
16in tall and 40in long –was seen stalking around his home in Clacton, Essex today after the panic from Sunday night.

But the only thing he seemed to have on his mind was peering through a hole in the fence and lazily walking across a lawn.

The hunt is on! Teddy saunters across a garden - perhaps to pounce on something he spotted

And no one could blame him for slinking about after his brush with the limelight over the Bank Holiday weekend.

Teddy Bear lives just a few hundred yards from where 
holidaymakers spotted a big cat at a caravan park near Clacton in Essex 
on Sunday.

Following reports
 of a wild animal on the loose, armed officers and two police 
helicopters using heat-seeking equipment, which cost £880 an hour to 
run, were scrambled.

Workers
 from nearby Colchester Zoo carrying tranquilliser guns scoured the 
fields and residents were warned to stay indoors. Caravanners were 
temporarily moved to a nearby garden centre.

But
 while the local community was plunged into terror, Teddy Bear’s owner 
Ginny Murphy watched the drama unfold on television from Liverpool, 
where she was away. And she immediately had her suspicions.

‘It
 clicked right away,’ she said. ‘We thought it had to be Ted as he’s the
 only big gingery thing around there and he does tend to wander into 
that field.’

After looking at the pictures of the supposed lion Mrs Murphy said she had no doubt it was Ted.

‘There’s no question about, it’s him. As we were away he probably went into the field to sulk.

‘From a distance, because he has a light-coloured mane he does look a little lion like. I can see why someone would think that.

‘He’s
 a Maine Coon, which is the biggest breed of domestic cat. And he’s got 
the personality to match, he has such a bad attitude and puts the dog in
 his place all the time.

‘He thinks he’s the man of the house and has often been mistaken for a fox.’

Despite
 Mrs Murphy’s certainty as to the culprit in Operation Pussycat, 
however, there remain several witnesses who remain equally convinced 
that the creature they saw was much more than just a little kitty.

First
 to spot the animal was Denise Martin, 52, a warehouse worker from 
Canvey Island, on holiday at Earls Hall Farm with her husband Bob.

‘There
 was some smoke from a bonfire, but it cleared I could see this shape in
 the field, so I got the binoculars out,’ she said yesterday.

‘I said to my husband, “What do you make of that?” He said, “That’s a lion.” We weren’t scared at all – it was excitement.

‘You
 don’t often see something like that in the wild. At one point time it 
sat up and looked at us and we could see its ears twitching. It knew we 
were there and it sat down and started cleaning itself.’

Mr
 Martin, a driver, telephoned police. They initially thought it was a 
hoax and asked to speak to others at the site.

So he duly knocked on the
 door of Stephen and Gill Atkin’s caravan as they were settling down to 
have their supper around 7pm.

Mr
 Atkin, 52, a building maintenance inspector from Louth, Lincolnshire, 
said: ‘I went out and had a look through the binoculars. I saw what I’m 
sure was a very big cat. I thought, “Christ – that’s a lion.” It was 
big, about the length of two sheep.

‘It
 was 200 yards away but I wasn’t worried as we were nearer to the safety
 of our caravan than it was to us.

'The farmer turned up before the 
police got there and walked towards it, unarmed, and it ran off. He was 
brave.’

After speaking to Mr Atkin on Mr Martin’s mobile, the police roared into action.

‘They
 were very sceptical at first, quite understandably,’ Mr Martin said. 
‘When they did turn up but they missed it by three minutes.’

The hunt 
certainly injected an unexpected dose of excitement into the community 
of St Osyth, which until Sunday had held little intrigue for most except
 weathermen and caravan enthusiasts.

Officially
 the driest place in the country (with just 20.2in of rainfall last 
year, compared with the national average of 45.9in), its other claim to 
fame is the neighbouring settlement of St Osyth Beach – Essex’s largest 
concentration of static caravan parks.

But
 for 20 hours, the village – five miles west of Clacton-on-Sea on the 
B1027 – became the scene of the dramatic big-game mystery.

As
 news of the alleged predator in their midst filtered down, what 
followed was a mixture of unease and disbelief as villagers grappled 
with the questions on everyone’s mind about the unusual sighting: had it
 escaped from a zoo, circus or private owner? Was it born free or 
something tamer?

The search 
teams failed to find evidence of a lion – no fur, no droppings, one 
unconfirmed sighting of a paw print – and the police warning was soon 
downgraded to be ‘a bit wary’ if walking in the country.

Whatever
 it was, it had not escaped from Colchester Zoo, as all its animals had 
been accounted for. And a circus that had recently been in town told 
officers it was not one lion short of a full big top either.

As
 the day wore on, the mystery deepened as photographs of the by now 
world famous ‘Essex lion’ began emerging and, as so often in the modern 
age, were circulated via social networking sites.

Some were downright fakes, others simply seemed to make the situation even more woolly.

One, supposedly taken of it at night by a car, was soon dismissed as a fake.

Another,
 taken by Mrs Atkin on her digital camera, looked to the untrained eye 
rather like a sheep although she was genuinely believes it was ‘a big 
cat with pointy ears and a white ruff’.

Twitter,
 meanwhile, was awash with parodies, fake pictures and jokes. More than 
one gag dwelled on the fact that a luxurious mane and a permanent tan 
meant this ‘lion’ would blend in well with the Essex natives.

By
 last night most of St Osyth’s 4,119 residents were sleeping a little 
easier, safe in the knowledge that a rumble with a ‘King of the Jungle’ 
remains unlikely in their quiet neck of the woods.

Beast: The creature, thought to be a panther, was spotted in the early hours of this morning (file photo)

A panther has been spotted on the loose in the Cotswolds today.

Kieran Bourne, 30, said he was convinced he saw a big cat in his headlights as he made his way home across Cleeve Hill in the early hours of this morning.

He nearly collided with the animal by the side of the road, swerved, and saw it pounce into the bushes and disappear.

Mr Bourne, who contacted a big cat expert after the sighting, believed it was the same creature which shocked residents in fields at Winchcombe, near Cheltenham, in April.

He said: ‘It looked at me from the side of the road. I was coming round quite a sharp bend from Winchcombe up the hill to Cleeve Hill and it was on the left hand side of the road in my main beam – I nearly hit it.

‘It was the size of a large dog, about 2.5ft high and about 4ft long with a U-shaped tail curled upwards.

‘I swerved to the right to make sure I didn’t hit it and it pounced into the bushes.

‘I’m now 100 per cent sure it was a big black cat, with no markings on. It’s out there.’
