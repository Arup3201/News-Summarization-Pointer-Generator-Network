Tracey Emin has said she would like her controversial unmade bed artwork to stay in the UK - but doubts it will because nowhere can afford the £1million price tag.

My Bed - derided by many critics at the time - is a dishevelled monument to 'ladette' culture, surrounded by used condoms, worn knickers, cigarette butts and vodka bottles.

It almost won the prestigious Turner Prize in 1999, and will go under the hammer at Christie's auction house in London next Tuesday, where it is expected to net current owner Charles Saatchi between £800,000 and £1.2million.

'Iconic': Emin said My Bed, which nearly won the Turner Prize, 'changed people's perceptions of art'

Popular: The bed, pictured on display in 2003, is currently owned by Charles Saatchi which could make £1.2m from the sale

Ahead of the sale, Emin, 50, said she would prefer the work go on display rather than vanish into a private collection, but doubted anywhere could produce the necessary cash.

She told the Evening Standard: 'I feel kind of philosophical about it. The Tate really want it but they haven’t any money. No one has any money to buy it.'

Earlier today she revealed how she is struck by flashbacks when she's near the bed, the display of which she said 'changed people's perceptions of art'.

She said: 'This is a surreal experience. Every time I'm near the bed or install the bed I get flashbacks and recollections of when I first saw the bed, which was in my bedroom and that was 16 years ago.

'When I made the bed today, I actually had to get in it and pull the duvet over me and push it back to make it feel real and look real.

'Even the smell and everything, it's all still there for me. It's very, very evocative. Except it's like waking up, I wouldn't say a nightmare, but definitely ... it's really strange.

Pricey: Emin revealed that she doubts any UK galleries will be prepared to pay between £800,000 and £1.2million for the piece

'It's now going on a different journey. I just hope it goes to a nice place. It's helped me a lot.'

Emin said reactions to the artwork, which she produced after a traumatic relationship breakdown, varied across the globe.

She said: 'In Japan they were shocked by my dirty slippers but they stole some bloody knickers and some condoms'.

'In America it was like, "Yeah, we've seen feminist art before, we've done it already", no fuss, just treated it like a regular artwork.

'Of course in the UK, it just exploded with the Turner Prize. It just went crazy. I still think it's iconic. There was nothing in the world in art that has ever looked like this, that has ever been like this, it's seminal.

'It changed people's perceptions of what art is and what art can be. That's why it's still really special to me. If I could I would show this at my next exhibition. I still love it, I still stand by it and I made it 16 years ago.'

Saatchi, who paid £150,000 for My Bed in 2000, is selling it to support the work of his public gallery in Chelsea.
