Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong says he'll return to his bike later this month for a state-long trek across Iowa.

Armstrong told the Des Moines Register that he and staffers from his Austin, Texas-based bicycle shop will ride for ‘three or four days’ in The Register’s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa (RAGBRAI), an annual event sponsored by the newspaper that runs from the Missouri to Mississippi rivers.

This will mark the fifth visit to RAGGRAI for Armstrong, who told interviewer Oprah Winfrey in January after years of denials that he doped for all seven of his Tour de France wins from 1999-2005.

Armstrong says his impending trip to Iowa isn't a statement or an experiment.

He says he simply wants to ride with what is typically ‘a friendly group of people that share the same interests.’

‘I'm well aware my presence is not an easy topic, and so I encourage people if they want to give a high-five, great,’ Armstrong told reporters when asked about his decision to take part in the event.

‘If you want to shoot me the bird, that's OK too. I’m a big boy, and so I made the bed, I get to sleep in it.’

Race director T.J. Juskiewicz told the Register, ‘We are open to anyone that wants to come ride RAGBRAI.’

Last month rmstrong insisted that ‘it is impossible to win the Tour de France 'without doping.’

His words will infuriate British hero Sir Bradley Wiggins who last year became the first Englishman in history to win the epic race.

Not giving up: Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong says he'll return to his bike later this month for a state-long trek across Iowa

Disqualification: Armstrong won the Tour de France a record-breaking seven consecutive times between 1999 and 2005 before being disqualified for life for taking drugs

Armstrong won it a record-breaking seven consecutive times between 1999 and 2005 before being disqualified for life for taking drugs.

Today Armstrong, 41, tells Le Monde: ‘It is impossible to win the Tour de France without doping. Because the Tour is an endurance test, where oxygen is crucial.

‘Just to give you one example – EPO [the blood booster erythropoietin] won’t help a sprinter win the 100 metres, but it will make all the difference for a runner doing the 10,000 metres. It’s obvious.’

The American was responding to the revelations that the 1998 French winner, Laurent Jalabert, used EPO.

Traces have since been found in DNA samples taken from urine provided by Jalabert during the race.

Speaking on the eve of this year’s race, Armstrong said that he ‘hadn’t invented doping’, adding: ‘Doping has always existed and it always will. I just participated in a system. I’m a human being.’

Questioned further about Jalabert, 
who has denied all the accusations against him, Armstrong said: ‘I’ve 
got a lot of respect for Jaja, but he’s lying.’

Armstrong
was banned from professional cycling in October 2012 when the US 
Anti-Doping Agency, USADA, accused him of leading ‘the most 
sophisticated, professional and successful doping program that sport has
ever seen.’

After 
consistently denying the drug accusations for years, Armstrong finally 
admitted what he had done, telling the Oprah Winfrey talk show: ‘It is 
my fault. I view this situation as one big lie.’

Tension: His words will infuriate British hero Sir Bradley Wiggins who last year became the first Englishman in history to win the epic race

Armstrong told Le Monde that he continues to train hard and will ‘try to watch some of the Tour de France on television’.

Sir Bradley, who is out of this year's Tour because of an injury, has always insisted that he is completely clear of drugs.

Armstrong was also forced to resign down from his Livestrong cancer foundation, which has raised millions for charity.

Last month Nike cut ties with Livestrong after helping turn the foundation and its trademark yellow rubber wristbands into a global brand.

The move by the sports shoe and clothing company ends a relationship that began in 2004 and helped the foundation raise more than $100million.

But the relationship soured with revelations that Armstrong and members of his legendary U.S. Postal Service team used performance-enhancing drugs.

Nike said it will stop making its Livestrong line of apparel after the 2013 holiday season.

Foundation and company officials said Nike will honor the financial terms of its contract until it expires in 2014.

Nike dropped its personal sponsorship of Armstrong last October after U.S. Anti-Doping Agency exposed the team doping program and portrayed Armstrong as its ringleader.

And after years of denials, Armstrong admitted earlier this year he used performance-enhancing drugs to win the Tour de France seven times.

Officials at Livestrong, which announced the split on Tuesday, said the foundation remains strong and committed to helping cancer patients worldwide through its survivorship programs.

Confession: Armstrong admitted to Oprah Winfrey that his seven Tour de France titles were won with the help of performance-enhancing drugs, but he denied that he used them for his 2009 comeback

Shamed: Armstrong told Oprah that he never tried to stop or change the culture of drug use in the sport

Armstrong, who started the charity in
1997 as the Lance Armstrong Foundation, was pushed off the board of 
directors in October and the organization later changed its formal name 
to Livestrong.

During a televised interview with Winfrey screened on January 17, he said 'I view this situation as one big lie that I repeated a lot of times.'

He admitted that he doped in some 
form for each of his seven Tour de France victories, though he 
maintained that the last time that he 'crossed that line' was in 2005.

The distinction of before and after 
2005 is important as that was the last year that capped off his 
incredible seven-year winning streak at the Tour de France.

Team Lance: Lance Armstrong said his former wife
Kristin, left in 2001, and his current girlfriend Anna Hansen, right in
2011, were supportive of regarding his drugs admission in January 

On top of the outright confession, he
said that part of the reason why it carried on for as long as it did 
was because he 'didn't feel like' he was cheating.

'The definition of cheat is to gain 
an advantage on a rival or foe that they didn't have. I didn't view it 
that way. I viewed it as a level playing field,' he said.

He described the elaborate doping 
ring that he and his teammates developed was not quite as legendary as 
the investigatory commissions described it.

'It was definitely professional and 
it was definitely smart if you can call it that but it was very 
conservative, very risk averse, and very aware of what mattered,' he 
said.

'While I've lived through this process ... I know the truth the truth isn’t what is out there, the truth isn't what I said.

'I didn't invent the culture but I 
didn't try to stop the culture and that's my mistake. The sport is now 
paying the price for that, and I am sorry for that.

'This story was so perfect for so 
long- and I mean that as I try to take myself out of this situation- 
it’s this mythic, perfect story and that wasn't true, on a lot of 
levels.'
