Hundreds of police officers swooped on addresses across London and the Home Counties yesterday in an operation aimed at smashing one of Britain’s most notorious crime gangs.

Senior members of the Adams syndicate were among 15 people arrested as officers dressed in riot gear descended on 25 properties.

Almost £300,000 in cash, designer watches, a handgun, shotguns and other weapons were recovered after years of painstaking investigation.

Several business addresses were also 
raided, including solicitors, accountants and property consultants 
suspected of laundering money.

At
 one safety deposit box in Central London police officers discovered 
£25,000 and a stash of expensive watches. In another property, a hidden 
safe held £100,000.

Scotland
 Yard is desperate to land a decisive blow on the Adams syndicate, which
 has influence worldwide and has a reputation for extreme violence. It 
has been connected to at least 25 murders.

Police
 suspect members of drug trafficking, extortion and hijacking but in 
recent years they have moved into white-collar and high-tech crime, 
including mortgage fraud.

A specialist police team, codenamed Operation Octopod, has been carrying out surveillance.

Detectives believe they have amassed evidence of conspiracy to assault, money laundering, fraud and revenue offences.

The raids were carried out under Proceeds of Crime Act legislation, which investigators hope could help finally smash the gang.

One of the properties raided was the £2.5million Clerkenwell mansion owned by Tommy Adams, 55, and his wife Androulla, 54.

Tommy,
 who once led the syndicate with his brothers Terry and Patrick, was 
jailed for seven and half years in 1998 after admitting his role in an 
£8million cannabis smuggling plot.

Neighbours
 knew him as a ‘businessman with a mysterious past’. One said: ‘Tommy is
 a man that no one would ever ask him anything about what he did.’

Terry,
 59, who was not arrested yesterday, has already served a seven-year 
sentence for money laundering. He was sent back to prison shortly after 
his release for failing to declare an expensive ‘post-prison makeover’ 
arranged by his wife at a luxury Hertfordshire hotel.

There
 is evidence that members of the Adams family have escaped prosecution 
by infiltrating the police and Crown Prosecution Service. Most of the 
200 officers involved in yesterday’s operation were not told the 
identities of the targets over fears that the information could be 
leaked.

At one garden flat in Highgate, North London, police seized a 24-year-old man believed to be a key figure in the group.

Officers broke through his front door – protected by an iron grille – using a steel battering ram just before 6am.

Det
 Chief Supt Tom Manson, of the Met, said the operation aimed to 
‘dismantle’ the gang. ‘This gang has believed they were untouchable but 
we are determined to prove they are not,’ he said.

‘The
 links between this gang and serious and violent crime are well 
documented, as is their strong influence across London, and, we believe,
 connections to criminals across Britain and Europe.’

The
 family crime business, known to many as the ‘A Team’, was also 
suspected of links to the Russian mafia and the powerful Columbian 
cocaine cartels.

Solicitors, accountants and investment advisers with links to the notorious gang were ordered to hand over documents under the proceeds of crime act, so they could be examined by financial investigators.

One of the suspected gang members is taken in by police, led out of the house in north London. The raids were the result of months of planning and building evidence against the suspected criminal gang

Some of the solicitors and financial 
advisors were also taken in for questioning on suspicion that they 
helped to run the finances of the gang as mortgage brokers and property 
developers.

The massive 
hit against the gang was launched after detectives apparently uncovered 
evidence of crimes including conspiracy to assault, money laundering, 
fraud and revenue offences.

The
 money confiscated totalled around £275,000 in cash, collected in safes 
and safety deposit boxes, in addition to luxury items like Rolexes, and 
computers and phones, which were used for financial correspondence.

Scotland Yard said at one property they found a safe £100,000 'tucked inside'.

The
 operation was part of a Scotland Yard case against the gang, which has 
taken months of detectives following money trails to link the properties
 with the gang's criminal gains.

While Scotland Yard did not name the criminal ring, which is also known as the
 A Team, they did call it 'one of the UK's longest established and high 
profile organised crime gangs'.

Detective Chief Superintendent Tom Manson of the MPS Specialist, Organised and Economic Crime Command, said: 'We believe we have arrested members of the most long established and high profile crime gang in London.

Tommy Adams, (pictured in an older handout for a previous conviction) patriarch and financier of the Adams gang - Described in court as a 'notorious gangster', is also believed to have been arrested as a part of targeted raids on a criminal gang

'This was a painstaking investigation and a discreet operation run by specialist officers until today when the combined resources of the Met were deployed on the arrest phase of the operation.

'The links between this gang and serious and violent crime are well documented as is their strong influence across London, and, we believe, connections to criminals across Britain and Europe.

'We believe they are responsible for a multi-million pound criminal business; laundering the profits from crime and using this money to commit other money-spinning offences.

'This is cash which can be used to fund further crime and provide luxurious lifestyles.

'For too long organised gangs have used advances in technology that have allowed them to hide their criminal gains and some even believe they can escape justice by bribing those who enforce the law.

'This operation and others like it are the Met's response.

'Any criminal gang operating in London needs to know that we will tackle them head on and hit them where it hurts most, by seizing their cash and assets.'

The list of people arrested during the raids, where they were arrested, and their charges is as follows:

All are being held at a central London police station while searches continue.

Since 2012, the Metropolitan Police Service has restrained, forfeited and confiscated over £62million in criminal cash and assets under the Proceeds of Crime Act of 2002.
