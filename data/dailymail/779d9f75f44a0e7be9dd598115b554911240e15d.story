Two women were at the centre of a police brawl today after appearing to have a fight with a pair of men over their behaviour in a branch of Aldi.

The fight took place on a train platform and was captured by a passenger on his mobile phone at Howdon train station, North Tyneside.

Police are now trying to identify the people involved in the brawl that involved the group rolling around on the ground with punches flying.

Bizarrely, the argument appeared to begin with one woman accusing a man of carrying out some kind of behaviour that upset them at budget supermarket Aldi.

Passengers watched open-mouthed as the foul mouthed row quickly escalated.

One of the woman yelled: 'Do you know what it is? I'm not really that bothered. Do you know that? Eh?'

A woman dressed in red then says: 'I'm the only one that f****** took pity on you. The only one that f****** took pity on you and you go and do that to me. You go and do that to me.'

The first women then begins talking about something the man had done while he was in Aldi.

'Get the f*** off me. You get the f*** off me. Get the f*** off us.'

The woman in red then urges a man called 'Danny' to 'leave him'. It's not clear who's fighting with who in the video.

As the group pile on top of each other on the platform, a pair of legs can be seen kicking out as somebody frantically tries to escape. A couple of elderly women hurry off the train past the scrapping youngsters.

The fight was filmed by Adam Clery, 25, who was on his way to an exhibition in Whitley Bay and had already moved seats because another couple had been arguing.

He said: 'The argument was between the two girls, and for the most part the two lads were trying to keep the peace. It just sort of escalated as they were getting off.

'Instinct told me to get my phone out in case something happened.

I think you’re supposed to be quite scared or intimidated in those situations,  but I grew up in North Shields, so watching people batter each other on public transport is neither new or exciting.

The fight escalates as the group spills out of the train onto the platform. Police are studying CCTV footage to identify those involved

'I’ve got scrap-apathy, you might say.'

Sharon Kelly director of customer services at DBTW, which operates the Metro on behalf of Nexus, said: 'We work closely with the police to ensure the Metro is safe for the tens of thousands of people who use it every day and as a result,  crime is low.

'We are making our CCTV footage available to the police in relation to this incident and we urge passengers to come forward with any information they might have.'

A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'We received a report of a fight at Howdon Metro Station at 2.30pm on Monday.

'Enquiries are ongoing to identify the people involved.'
