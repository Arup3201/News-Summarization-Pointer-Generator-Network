Starbucks coffee is known for offering seasonal drinks like iced Frappuccino in the summer and Pumpkin Spice lattes in the fall but for the first time ever Starbucks patrons will be able to warm up with a beer flavored coffee.

You read correctly, Starbuck's new Dark Barrel Latte is topped with whipped cream and a dark caramel sauce and flavored coffee syrup that is designed to taste like dark Irish beers such as Guinness.

Starbucks promises customers that while the coffee tastes like beer, there is no actual alcohol in the drink.

Can you taste the difference?: Starbucks is testing its new coffee beverage the Dark Barrel Latte (left) meant to taste like stout beers such as Guinness (right)

The new beer flavored coffee drink is in limited Starbucks locations as the franchise is still testing the beverage in order to determine its popularity.

According to Musictimes.com one can get Starbucks Dark Barrel Latte in select stores in Columbus, Ohio and also some in Florida.

So far, some who've tasted the beverage had a hard time believing it's not beer and love the taste.

Others dislike the new flavor and warn people against ordering the drink.

'Tried the Dark Barrel latte from Starbucks. Basically tastes like a beer but with espresso #notbad #thenewwhitegirlwasted #espressobuzzed,' said Twitter user Kayla.

Limited to some locations: The Dark Barrel Latte is available for sampling in some Ohio and Florida locations and so far those who have tried the drink say it tastes like Guinness 

Some love it: Those who've tried the beverage took to Twitter to express their opinion of the drink's unique dark and alcoholic flavor 

'Severely disappointed in @Starbucks. The Dark Barrel Latte is horrid. Bring back my Salted Caramel Latte to Ohio, PLEASE. #notfallwithoutit,' said Twitter user Kristin Juth.

'Don't try the dark barrel latte from Starbucks cuz it's this icky mix of molasses and almost beer taste,' writes Twitter user Jenni Tatum.

Starbucks locations offering the drink give customers the opportunity to fill out a survey detailing what they like and don't like about the drink.

They also answer questions about the drink itself.

A packet  detailing the beverage writes of the new product ' Inspired by the rise of craft beers, Dark Barrel brings together savory toasty malt and chocolaty tastes topped with sweet dark caramel drizzle. This sophisticated combination offers a delicious complexity that build with every sip.'

Other more traditional coffee flavors currently being tested are the Cherries Jubilee Mocha and the Chestnut Praline Latte.

Everything you ever need to know: Starbucks published an information packet about their new beverage and say that it is both 'sophisticated'  and 'chocolaty'

Some hate it: While some love the Guinness like taste of Starbucks's new drink, others warn against spending money on the drink they find to be disgusting

Nauseated: Some went to far as to say that drinking the beverage in the morning is 'so yuck' and claim that it made them feel sick to their stomach especially during the early hours
