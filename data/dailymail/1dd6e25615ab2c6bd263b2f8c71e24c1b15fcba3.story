It was a dramatic night of football at the Emirates as Arsene Wenger's side contrived to give away a three goal lead and draw with Belgian side Anderlecht. 

Arsenal were cruising after 58 minutes thanks to Mikel Arteta, Alexis Sanchez and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain but in the final 30 minutes crumbled and conceded three goals.  

Here, Sportsmail's Rob Draper gives his verdict on how the players performed on Tuesday.

Arsenal (4-2-3-1)

Wojciech Szczesny - 6

Sharp enough early on to save Arsenal from falling behind. 

Calum Chambers - 5

Beaten by Kawaya for the first Anderlecht goal. Looked a weak link. 

Per Mertesacker - 5.5

Steady early on - but terribly weak to allow Mitrovic the equalising header.

Nacho Monreal - 5.5

Never 100 per cent certain and exposed when he gave penalty away.  

Kieran Gibbs - 6.6

A quieter game, but dependable. Consistently the best in the back four. 

Mikel Arteta - 6

Great penalty - but early on there were large gaps in front of the back four.  

Mikel Arteta opened scoring for Arsenal with a chipped penalty

Aaron Ramsey - 5.5

Endeavour is there but still yet to reach the heights of last season. 

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - 7

Excellent form. Great finish for his goal and always injecting pace and momentum. 

Alexis Sanchez - 8.5

Superb. Involved in all three goals, never stops battling and a phenomenal finished.  

Alexis Sanchez shoots and scores Arsenal's second goal with a volley from 20 yards

Santi Cazorla - 6.5

Busy and unerringly accurate. Rarely has a poor game. 

Danny Welbeck - 6

Started brightly. Offers an outlet and troubles opponents, as he proved when he won his marginal penalty. Faded a little. 

Subs

Flamini 6 (for Arteta 63)

Rosicky 6 (for Oxlade-Chamberlain 82)

Podolski 6 (for Welbeck 82)

Anderlecht (4-2-3-1) 

Proto 6; Vandenborre 6, Mbemba 6.5, Deschacht 5.5, Acheampong 6.5 ; Tielemans 6, Kjestan 6; Najar 7, Praet 6.5, Conte, 5.5; Cyriac 5.5

Subs: Kawaya 7 (for Conte 46), Dendoncker 6.5 (for Mbemba 54), Mitrovic 7 (for Cyriac 62)
