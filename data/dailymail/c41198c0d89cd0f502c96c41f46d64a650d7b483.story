The good people of Yorkshire weren’t exactly shy about their contribution to the last Olympics where they won as many gold medals as Australia.

So while the rest of the country reflects on England’s World Cup shambles, those in the white rose county can claim bragging rights if Argentina go all the way under a manager who was made in Sheffield and Leeds.

Alex Sabella, the man in charge of Lionel Messi and Co in Brazil, spent three-and-a-half formative years in Yorkshire between 1978 and the end of 1981; two seasons at Bramall Lane with Sheffield United and 12 months at Elland Road.

Made in Yorkshire? Argentina boss Alejandro Sabella had spells in England as a player

Although he didn’t have the same meteoric impact as Tottenham’s two Argentinians, Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa, Sabella’s team-mates and managers from that era believe his years in England helped him develop the  managerial skills now being seen in the World Cup.

Professional, popular and strong-willed, Sabella also had a twinkle in his eye. His Sheffield United team-mate Simon Stainrod recalls with a smile: ‘He would stitch me up like a kipper so I’d be blamed for little tricks he’d played.’

Sabella also received advice passed down from Don Revie, one of English football’s great managers, via his Leeds manager Allan Clarke.

‘The gaffer (Revie) always used to say if a player’s wife was happy, the player would be happy and he’d be at his best,’ said Clarke.

‘It’s something I told Alex and he isn’t daft, he will know the key to Argentina is keeping Messi and the others happy. Then the talent can take over.’

And Messi has sparkled so far at this World Cup, with Argentina playing Belgium on Saturday for a place in the semi-finals.

Sabella was 23 when he moved from Argentina to Sheffield.

The myth is that Sheffield United manager Harry Haslam refused to pay £500,000 for Diego Maradona on a scouting trip to South America and bought Sabella as a cheaper option. In reality, Haslam was never going to get near Maradona, who was already tipped for superstardom at 16. The Blades boss was happy to land another talented left-footed midfielder for £160,000.

Stainrod was in awe of the exotic South American who was suddenly training alongside him. ‘Alex was a really good player,’ he says. ‘I learned a lot from him. No matter what the condition of the pitch, he’d wear rubbers on his boots rather than screw-in studs, which was an eye-opener to me. Even on a wet muddy pitch.’

Sabella learned his first word of  English, ‘backheel’, at training and picked up the language from there. He quickly cottoned on to English dressing-room culture, to Stainrod’s cost.

‘He was the first player I’d ever seen who wouldn’t go out to warm up on the pitch before matches,’ recounts Stainrod. ‘He’d stay in the dressing-room and do his own stretches there.

‘Before a game at Preston I stayed inside with him. At one stage I had to pop to use the loo. After the game the lads came in and when they tried to put their shirts on, the sleeves had knots in them. When they put their socks on the toes had been cut off. I got the blame for it because I was a bit of an idiot in those days but it was Alex.

‘He’d set me up and nobody believed me. He’d even cut the ends off his own socks to make it look like he was a victim, too. Brilliant. He still doesn’t own up to it but there’s a cheeky smile when it’s mentioned.’

Even as a young man 7,000 miles from home, Sabella had the natural authority and strength of character which are hallmarks of successful managers.

Team-mate and neighbour Tony Kenworthy said: ‘He wouldn’t train on a Friday which would cause a few arguments between him and the coach Danny Bergara. It was to do with Alex’s culture — he didn’t want to run the slightest risk of injury.

‘The players took to him easily. He was humorous, intelligent and quickly picked up the banter. He would knock on my door and we’d spend evenings together watching football videos. He was very serious about the game.’

United didn’t have a good team and were relegated from the old Second Division. But Sabella was their best player and after a season in the Third Division he was snapped up for £400,000 by Leeds, who were in the top flight.

‘Some fans gave him a tough time when he joined Leeds. He was spat at in Sheffield when he was out shopping with his family,’ says Stainrod.

‘Despite that he loved England and our football. He still speaks excellent English. I saw him in Argentina a few years ago and he asked about getting a manager’s job here. Then he went to Estudiantes as manager, did well and the rest is history.

‘He was a great player. He would have won 50 caps for Argentina but unfortunately for him he was in the era of Maradona.’

While Sabella is still regarded as a Blades legend - his defence-splitting pass for Peter Anderson’s goal against Sunderland in 1978 made it to video as one of the greatest goals seen on Match of the Day - he struggled at Leeds. He was tough enough for the old First Division but probably not quick enough.

The club had sacked the manager who signed him, Jimmy Adamson, and replaced him with club legend and former England World Cup striker Clarke. Sabella’s wife felt homesick. ‘He came to see me and said his wife was unhappy, and she wanted to go back home,’ said Clarke.

‘I did what Don Revie would have done. I didn’t want Alex to go, he was a very good player with an excellent left foot, but keeping him when his family were unhappy wouldn’t have worked out for anyone. So I helped him find a club and we let him go to Estudiantes. When I heard he’d got the Argentina job, I thought: “Blow me, it’s him!”’

Even in the early 1980s there were signs Sabella was an educator who took people with him. ‘Alex was a big influence on me, the way he’d do extra training sessions, treat the game properly,’ says Stainrod.

‘And he wasn’t soft. The game in Argentina might be more open than in England but you still get tackles flying in.

‘Most importantly, he understood footballers. He knows when you’ve got someone as outrageously talented as Messi, you are obliged to get the best out of him and build your team like that. If he was able to help me to be decent, he’ll be able to turn Messi into a world champion.’
