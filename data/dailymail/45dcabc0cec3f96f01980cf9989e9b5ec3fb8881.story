Thomas Muller claims he knew of Manchester United's interest in the summer, but says his decision to stay at Bayern Munich was an easy one.

The German forward, who was a star man as his nation lifted the World Cup, signed a new contract with the Bundesliga champions until 2019.

Louis van Gaal was a big fan of Muller while in charge at Bayern, so much so that he said the youngster 'has to play' every game, but the 25-year-old insists he sees his future with Pep Guardiola and co.

'I know there was interest, but Man Utd were interested in a lot of players this summer,' Muller told Raphael Honigstein in an interview with the Guardian.

'It never really got anywhere because I had just renewed my contract [until 2019], and Bayern were clear that they saw my future here. 

'The decision for me was an easy one.'

Manchester United instead signed Angel Di Maria and Radamel Falcao for the attacking positions this season.
