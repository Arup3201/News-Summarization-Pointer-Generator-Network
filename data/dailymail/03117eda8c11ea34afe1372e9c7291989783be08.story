The tornado wrought havoc in Coalville, Leicestershire, this morning reaching the the town centre at around 7am.

Roof tiles came crashing down into the street, damaging cars, and bins were sent flying through the air.

Commenting on the freak weather, A Met Office spokesman said: 'The set up was conducive to tornadic activity and we have had some reliable reports today.'

Stormy seas submerge a yacht at Hurst Spit in The New Forest, on the south cost of England, today

'At first I thought it was a huge lorry but when I opened my curtains and looked out of my window I couldn't believe my eyes. There was a wheelie bin flying past and down the street, about ten feet up in the air. 

'There were roof tiles crashing down into the street and landing on cars and debris flying everywhere. 

'It felt like a tornado. The whole thing can't have lasted more than two minutes before everything went dead quiet. 

'I had a wander around the town and there is debris lying across a square mile area. A house across the road from me has half its roof missing. It was incredible, I've never seen anything like it.'

Highways Agency staff in County Durham are on standby with their fleet of gritters and tons of road salt stockpiled in huge barns

Each truck will hold around 12 tonnes of salt and is ready to be dispatched at a moment's notice of ice appearing on any major roads in County Durham

Although temperatures will appear close to the average for the time of year, gritters are now laying in wait for icy climates and the Carrville depot has collected enough salt to last for the remainder of the season

Another resident, Kathryn Crick, said: 'I woke up to this terrific rumbling and whirring sound. The windows were shaking violently and I instinctively jumped into the centre of the bedroom. I honestly thought it was an earthquake.'

'My next door neighbour's roof tiles came crashing down into the gardens below and a trampoline was lifted up and thrown into a fence.'

Anyone planning trips to the coast were being urged to visit life-guarded beaches this weekend.

The warning follows last Sunday’s tragic deaths of three surfers who died trying to rescue four teenage boys from the surf and rough seas at Mawgan Porth near Newquay, Cornwall.

New season: The turn in weather did not appear to affect the first day of hunting season in Gloucestershire, above

Hordes of riders from the Duke of Beaufort's Hunt gathered for the opening meet at Worcester Lodge, Gloucestershire

After the hottest Halloween in history, the autumn downpours arrived yesterday – and will vanish in time for a cool Bonfire Night.

After sunshine and showers today and Tuesday, Bonfire Night will be the ‘best day of the week’, forecasters said.

The Meteorological Office predicts dry weather with some sunny spells and – most importantly – a clear night across the UK on Wednesday.

It follows the weekend’s heavy rain, which arrived just as many of the veteran cars in the London to Brighton car rally had stuttered to a halt.

The band of heavy showers which moved across Britain even produced a mini tornado, hitting the Leicestershire town of Coalville at 7.20am yesterday.

Part of the roof at the Belvoir Shopping Centre could be seen ripped off while there was damage to houses, cars and fences. Meanwhile, a search continued for the skipper and crew of a fishing trawler which went missing off the north-east coast.

The vessel was last heard from about 100 miles east of the Farne Islands. An RAF helicopter winched three people to safety yesterday afternoon, one of whom died last night. Two more trawlermen are missing.

 This November will mark the 10th anniversary of the passing of the Hunting Act which banned fox hunting with dogs in February 2005

Last Friday, temperatures hit 23.6C (74.3F) in Gravesend and Kew Gardens, making it the warmest Halloween on record.

Met Office forecaster Kirk Waite said: ‘Over the next few days there will be bands of showers and some sunny periods. ‘Temperatures will be noticeably cooler and closer to normal for the time of year. There will be a ground frost in quite a few places.’

People attempted to take shelter under umbrellas bending backwards in the wind at Brighton Beach today - just two days after crowds were sunbathing.

And in County Durham, Highways Agency staff are being placed on standby with their fleet of gritters and tons of road salt.

Although temperatures will appear close to the average for the time of year, gritters are now laying in wait for icy climates and the Carrville depot has collected enough salt to last for the remainder of the season.

Each truck will hold around 12 tonnes of salt and is ready to be dispatched at a moment's notice of ice appearing on any major roads in County Durham. 

Many supporters of fox hunting are calling for a repeal of the ban, saying the current law is hard to interpret and enforce

Loophole: Hunters take advantage of exemptions in the law to continue the sport without being prosecuted under The Hunting Act 2004

The turn in weather did not appear to affect the first day of hunting season though as hounds and horses  gathered in their thousands across the UK countryside. 

Cutting a majestic sight through the land surrounding Headlam village in County Durham, the Zetland Hunt paraded through the rural lanes, drawing crowds to watch the spectacle.

Riders from the Duke of Beaufort's Hunt also met for the opening meet  at Worcester Lodge near Badminton in Gloucestershire yesterday.

This November will mark the 10th anniversary of the passing of the Hunting Act which banned fox hunting with dogs in February 2005. 

The hunts take advantage of loopholes in the law to continue the sport. Hunting with birds of prey is the most popular way of getting around legislation. 

The other is the 'accident' - when hounds attack foxes during a perfectly legal rabbit chase, despite the rider's best efforts to call them off.
