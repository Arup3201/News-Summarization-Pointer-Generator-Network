Beauty queen Chloe Hopkins was subjected to a two year stalking ordeal by an obsessed admirer

A beauty queen who was stalked by an obsessed admirer for two years left court in tears after he was sent to prison today.

Chloe Hopkins, 20, said Anthony Mantova, 34, made her life a misery after he began following her on crutches threatening: ‘Your tiara and sash would look good on my bedroom floor.’

He tattooed Chloe’s name across his chest and also wore a T shirt with her photograph on it.

Not
only that but he attended her church, showered her with birthday, 
Christmas and Valentine’s cards, posted comments about her on Facebook 
and even turned up at her friend’s funeral.

He
also went to gigs where Miss Hopkins – who was crowned Miss Prestatyn 
2010 – was singing and walked past her home on many occasions.

Mr Mantova, 34, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, pleaded guilty to harassment and was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison.

Miss Hopkins said: ‘Throughout the 
harassment I have suffered at the hands of Anthony Mantova I have been 
unable to answer the question as to what actually I have done to deserve
this.’

Mr Mantova wrote 
lies about her on Facebook and when Miss Hopkins complained to police he
claimed she hated disabled people and wanted them all dead.

Miss Hopkins said her ordeal had 
‘destroyed’ her relationship with her 52-year-old musician father, who 
was powerless to do anything after he was warned by police not to 
approach Mr Mantova.

Miss Hopkins added: ‘I feel sick leaving the house now. Mum and dad have to go out and tell me whether it was clear or not.

‘For
the last few weeks every time I’ve gone into town I’ve been thinking, 
‘Is he going to come out from around a corner?’ Every time I heard a 
crutch I’d would think, ‘Is that him behind me?’

 ‘It
just feels to me like he’s lonely and wants attention. He asked me out 
once and I said, ‘That’s sweet of you, but I’m just not ready for a 
relationship at the moment.

‘I
want to focus on my music career.’ From that point on it was world war 
three. He was saying I wanted all disabled people dead. That broke my 
heart because I’m just not that kind of person.”

‘I
remember his crutches clipping the pavement as he walked. Now I’m now 
too distracted looking for Anthony instead of concentrating on my 
performance.'

Miss Hopkins was so traumatised by 
his actions that she took an overdose of anti-depressants and constantly
listened out for the sound of Mr Mantova’s crutches ‘clipping the 
pavement’.

Miss Hopkins and
Mr Mantova met when she was out in a pub with four friends in 2010. She
noticed him sitting on his own and invited him to join them before 
giving him a life home.

This act of kindness led to Mr Mantova following Miss Hopkins around their seaside town and also Chester.

While she was at a Miss Prestatyn event at a local cinema, Mr Mantova turned up and refused to leave until police arrived.

He set up a “Where are you now?” internet account in Miss Hopkins’s 
name and posted a public petition on Facebook : “Stop Chloe Hopkins of 
Prestatyn.”

Miss Hopkins said her ordeal had 
‘destroyed’ her relationship with her 52-year-old musician father, who 
was powerless to do anything after he was warned by police not to 
approach Mr Mantova.

Miss Hopkins said: ‘I feel sick leaving the house now. Mum and dad have to go out and tell me whether it was clear or not.

‘For
the last few weeks every time I’ve gone into town I’ve been thinking, 
‘Is he going to come out from around a corner?’ Every time I heard a 
crutch I’d would think, ‘Is that him behind me?’

She added: ‘It
just feels to me like he’s lonely and wants attention. He asked me out 
once and I said, ‘That’s sweet of you, but I’m just not ready for a 
relationship at the moment.

Mr Mantova used to turn up to beauty queen Chloe Hopkins's (pictured) gigs where she was singing

‘I
want to focus on my music career.’ From that point on it was world war 
three. He was saying I wanted all disabled people dead. That broke my 
heart because I’m just not that kind of person.”

‘I
remember his crutches clipping the pavement as he walked. Now I’m now 
too distracted looking for Anthony instead of concentrating on my 
performance.'

North Wales Police issued a warning in late 2011 but Mr Mantova took no notice and continued to pester Chloe.

Prosecutor Mr Matthew Ellis said: “He
posted sexually motivated comments on her Facebook page. He asked her 
whether she would take his virginity and when she was Miss Prestatyn he 
said that her tiara and sash would look good on her bedroom floor.

‘He
joined her church and could be seen walking past her home even though 
he was never attending the church. The defendant had a tattoo with four 
names in his chest. Chloe, Dan, Fran and Jamie.

‘He
would send Valentines and birthday cards to her. She told him that she 
didn’t want to see him again but he posted love songs on Facebook and 
“‘babe do you want something hard between your legs”.

‘He even used a picture of her from the Miss Prestatyn website and had it printed on a T-shirt. At a funeral he came and sat behind her and she unable to relax and pay her respects to her friend.

‘When he was arrested he said he did it as revenge for things that Chloe had done to him. He said he wanted to upset her because she was getting away with murder.

‘He said he would continue to harass her from prison unless she apologised to him. He said he wasn’t in love with or obsessed by her but he wanted others to see her for what she really is.’

Mr Mantova was also banned from contacting Miss Hopkins under a restraining order. The magistrates said his behaviour was ‘entirely unprovoked’ and caused ‘extreme stress and anxiety’.

His lawyer Gwyn Jones said in mitigation: ‘He has to accept that these difficulties in early part of his life means that he doesn’t have the usual social skills that you would expect of a 34 year old.

‘They started out as friends however they fell out with what can only be regarded as a petty and infantile dispute.’
