Their mother is a successful fashion designer so it's perhaps no surprise that the Beckham children have been named the most fashionable celebrity children in the world.

Victoria and David's mini fashionista Harper topped the poll followed by her brothers Brooklyn, 15, and Romeo, 11.

The Beckham's third son, Cruz, also featured in the top ten in sixth place.

Despite being just two-years-old Harper has a wardrobe full of designer labels. By the time she was 18 months, she had been pictured in a shoe collection worth £1,500.

She stole the show earlier this year when her mother revealed her latest collection at New York Fashion Week by just wearing her hair in an adorable top bun with a bow.

So it's no wonder a survey of new mothers have voted her the planet's most stylish toddler.

Following in their mother's footsteps: Brooklyn, left, has been a magazine cover star, while Romeo has modelled for Burberry

In the poll carried out by Start-rite shoes, Brooklyn took second place behind his sister following his modelling debut last week. He appeared on the front cover of Man About Town magazine with a pout that would make his mother proud.

Romeo, who was third in the poll, has already made steps in the modelling world after being featured in a campaign for Burberry.

Victoria told The Sun last year that the children are not under any pressure to follow her and David into the showbiz world.  

'I don't want to pressure them. They should be keen and reach as much as possible. But the most important thing is they are happy,' she said. 'They lead a very privileged life but they don't get everything they ask for. We always tell them how lucky they are.'

Fashionable: Suri Cruise, pictured with her mother Katie, was fourth in the poll

And despite Harper always looking immaculate in pretty dresses when she's pictured out with the family, Victoria said her little girl is a real tom boy when around her brothers at home.

The Beckham trio were followed in the poll by Tom Cruise and Katie Holme's daughter, Suri, and Will Smith's daughter, Willow.

Suri caused a surge in demand for heels for toddlers when she was pictured in a pair at the tender age of three. Now aged seven, she's tipped to launch her own fashion range at a department store this year.

Also making the top ten most stylish 
celebrity children were Myleene Klass' daughter Ava, Beyonce's daughter 
Blue Ivy and two of Angelina Jolie's brood - Maddox Jolie Pitt and 
Shiloh Jolie Pitt.

The British mothers questioned said it 
was around the age of nine that they felt children started to show their
 fashion independence.

Fashion sense: The mothers questioned said their children started picking their own outfits from the age of three - but left to their own devices, many wanted to wear fancy dress

But some admitted their children had started to help pick out their own clothes to wear from the age of three.

A third of the mothers said their children enjoy shopping so they can pick out their own outfits while a fifth have daily battles with their offspring over what they will wear.

One in seven said their children always keep an eye on the latest fashions while one in ten want to wear fancy dress most days of the week - which can be a challenge on a school day.

Start-rite shoes will be showcasing their latest trends for children in a catwalk show that will be streamed live on Wednesday at 1pm via www.studiotalk.tv
