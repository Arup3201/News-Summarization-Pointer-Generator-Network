Addison Cresswell died of a heart attack after taking cocaine at a Christmas party, an inquest heard

A top showbiz agent who represented Jonathan Ross and Michael Macintyre died of a heart attack after snorting cocaine at a Christmas party, an inquest heard.

Addison Cresswell, 53, who helped launch the careers of many of Britain's top comedians, died on December 23 last year - just 72 hours after he had taken the drug.

His wife Shelley, who did not attend the party, woke in the middle of the night to find her husband gasping for breath beside her, a coroner was told.

He was taken to hospital where he later died.

Today St Pancras Coroner, Jacqueline Devonish, ruled he had died a 'drug related' death.

Miss Devonish added that pathologist 
Professor Marco Novelli, who carried out the post mortem, confirmed 'cocaine had been taken three days prior to death, but there was no use 
within the last 72 hours.

'The
 pathology report showed he had suffered from an acute myocardiac 
infarction along with a coronary artery atherosclerosis triggered by 
cocaine usage.

'On the balance of probabilities the death was drug related.'

She added: 'His work was clearly very stressful in working with the media.

'It
 is clear he did engage in occasion use of cocaine but this did not 
occur with family or at home but seemed to occur only at social events.

'His
 wife said at the Christmas party he attended 72 hours before his death 
he took cocaine, the toxicology report confirms this.

'He
 was not a drug abuser in so far as he was not dependent on drugs. He 
took drugs occasionally and I am satisfied this was the cause of death.'

She recorded a verdict of drug related death.

Cresswell's management company 'Off the Kerb' has represented Alan Carr, Jo Brand, Jack Dee and Lee Evans. Through the firm 'Open Mike' he also produced Live at the Apollo.

Cresswell represented Jonathan Ross, left, and Michael McIntyre among many other comedy talents. Creswell died in hospital a few days before Christmas last year, and inquest was told

The inquest heard that Cresswell, who had been hospitalised in 2007 with cocaine psychosis, had a history of heart problems as well as drug and alcohol abuse.

In a statement read Mrs Cresswell, who was too distressed to attend the inquest, said: 'He sometimes took cocaine on the odd occasion after a long period of work as a way of letting go and releasing stress.

'I never witnessed his drug use first hand. He never took cocaine at home and we never discussed it.'

Referring to his time in hospital she said: 'After a long party he was hospitalised with a diagnosis of stress and cocaine.

The comedy agent also represented Jo Brand, pictured. His family said they were still in 'shock' following his sudden death

'The incident scared Addison and he stopped attending late night social engagements. In the last eight years he attended the odd social occasion after a media event but these were few and far between.'

Mrs Cresswell described her husband as a very 'private' man. 'His life was sometimes hectic and stressful, but he was very happy, he had achieved a happy medium between work and his personal life.

His brother, William Luke Cresswell, said: I believe he took cocaine socially but not with family. It was such a shock.'

Paramedic Sean Leatham, who treated Cresswell at his home in Thornhill Crescent, Islington, said: 'We were called at about 2.51 to reports of a 53 year old man in cardiac arrest.

'We arrived at 2.56pm. We saw a woman upstairs performing ineffective CPR on a man on the floor. We told her to step away.

'There was no pulse and no breathing efforts so we performed CPR. We then cleared a space so we could perform advanced life support.'

He added: 'As we maintained life support we took a medical history from his wife, which established stress and a previous case of pneumonia.

'He had taken cocaine at a party 72 hours ago and had been complaining of chest pains for 24 to 48 hours before.'

Cresswell was rushed to University College Hospital where doctors carried out eight cycles of CPR and administered adrenaline but without success. He was pronounced dead at 5am.

Comedian James Cordon tweeted his condolences shortly after the manager's death

TV host Dermot O'Leary also paid tribute to Cresswell - describing him as a 'Titan of the industry'
