During his time as an aide, Reggie Love developed a very personal bond with U.S. president Barack Obama.

The 'bodyman' worked for the president during the 2008 presidential campaign and Obama's first years in the White House.

In his memoir Power Forward: My Presidential Education, extracts of which have been published in the Washington Post, Love recounts a moment when his professional relationship with the president turned personal.

Love wrote that he was staying in a hotel during the presidential election campaign when he had a female friend to stay.

Barging in: Reggie Love, (left) Obama's former personal aide, has revealed in his memoir how the President once entered his hotel room while he had a female guest staying the night 

The next morning Love was getting ready for the day ahead but the woman was in bed when, using the Secret Service master key, Obama opened the door, walked in, and said: 'Hey, Reggie, we need to go over the schedule.'

After noticing the guest lying on the bed he said: 'Oh, I apologize' before hurrying back out.

His terrified friend, with the cover pulled up to her throat, then asked: 'Was that... ?' To which Love replied: 'Senator Barack Obama.'

Later in the day, the campaign team boarded a plane to their next destination and Obama started arguing with his campaign staff over their progress. 

To lighten the mood, Love told Obama: 'You know, sir, if it’s any consolation, I’m having the time of my life.'

'And the senator said to me, “Well, Reggie, it’s actually not a consolation to me that my campaign for president can help subsidize your love life.”'

'Bodyman': Obama reportedly referred to Love as iReggie - a reference to Love's iPad usage.

The response drew a laugh from David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs, but Love had a comeback.

He said: 'Actually, sir, I got way more action in college.' 

Love applied for an internship at the White House in 2006 after studying at Duke where he also played wide receiver for the football team.

Love was appointed 'deputy political director' and Obama reportedly referred to Love as iReggie - a reference to Love's iPad usage. Love left his position at the end of 2011 to pursue an MBA.
