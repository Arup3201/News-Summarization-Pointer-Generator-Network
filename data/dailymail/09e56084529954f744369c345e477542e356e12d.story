This is the moment a woman broke down in tears of joy as she was reunited with her childhood teddy bear.

Jessica Crawford had been forced to put her beloved toy Whitey into storage after it lost its nose, eyes, ear and, eventually, its entire head.

But her fiancé spent months secretly restoring the destroyed bear - before surprising her with it.

Emotion: Jessica Crawford breaks down in tears of joy as she is reunited with her childhood teddy bear

Heartwarming: Miss Crawford had been forced to put her beloved toy Whitey into storage after he lost his nose, eyes, ear and, eventually, his entire head. But her fiancé  secretly restored the bear

Miss Crawford's heartwarming reunion with the cuddly toy was captured on video by her fiancé, Vas Alli.

She can be seen posing with a wrapped cardboard box, given to her by Mr Alli, who says: 'I love you with all my heart and I know there is noone that could replace me except for this.'

Miss Crawford, who lives in America, then opens the box and pulls out the bear, which she initially mistakes for a new toy.

However, after smelling the bear, she suddenly realises it is Whitey and instantly breaks down in tears.

'Best gift ever': She reaches inside the box and pulls out the bear, which has a bright red ribbon round its neck

'Oh my God, are you serious?' Miss Crawford says as she buries her face into the teddy bear.

'I smelled him and knew exactly what it was. Oh my God, it's Whitey.'

The emotional moment also affects Mr Alli, who can be heard saying: 'You are making me cry'.

Speaking to Inside Edition, Miss Crawford said seeing Whitey undamaged was 'a gift I thought I could never get back'.

She added that the white bear, which has a red ribbon tied round its neck, had been 'by her side' throughout her childhood.

'Anytime I cried, I ran to Whitey,' she said. 'He soaked up a lot of tears.'

However, as the years passed, Whitey started to suffer the effects of aging, according to the Huffington Post.

The bear's nose and eyes came off, its ear was chewed off by a dog and it eventually lost its entire head.

Reluctantly, Miss Crawford was forced to put the old toy into storage.

But after proposing to his girlfriend last Christmas, Mr Alli decided to surprise her again by restoring Whitey.

He painstakingly spent a month looking at thousand of vintage bears online in a bid to learn how to resurrect the old bear, according to KGO-TV.

He then took Whitey to a doll and teddy bear hospital in New Jersey, US, where it was restored to its former glory.

And Mr Alli's efforts appear to have paid off - with Miss Crawford describing the repaired toy as 'the best gift ever'.
