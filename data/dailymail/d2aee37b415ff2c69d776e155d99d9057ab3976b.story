Rising from her seat, hands punching the air above her head, German Chancellor Angela Merkel roared as her team thrashed Portugal 4-0 in their opening World Cup match earlier this month.

Since then Mrs Merkel, a leader already widely approved of in the polls, has enjoyed an upsurge in popularity - with some surveys suggesting spikes in support for her as the team progressed through the tournament.

And her reaction to Germany's win in the World Cup final on Sunday - which saw her celebrating in the dressing room with the victorious team - secured her place in the hearts of the nation.

Changing faces: Angela Merkel, pictured left to right from top left, 1991, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2003, 2004 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014

Her recent 
boost in the polls has been further bolstered by her tough stance 
against allegations of U.S. agents spying on Germany.

Last week, she expelled the CIA's Berlin chief - the move came a day after Berlin police searched the home and office of a German military intelligence official alleged to have been spying for America.

The U.S. official was told to leave the country in a public signal of Angela Merkel’s fury over US spying on Germany which in the past has included repeated snooping on her own mobile phone.

Her firm action in response to the alleged cases of spying - an issue which once saw Germans questioning her authority - has been met with public support.

Mrs Merkel, fondly nicknamed 'Mutti' or 'mother, is enjoying an all-time peak in her approval ratings.

But this weekend rumours emerged that the German Chancellor, who celebrates her 60th birthday on Thursday, might step down from her post before the next election - which is due to be held in 2017.

In an article published in Germany's Der 
Spiegel, which is usually well-informed on German politics, cabinet members and senior politicians were quoted confirming 
the possibility.

The German magazine said Merkel was interested in the role of European Council President, or the Secretary-General of the United Nations, both of which will be available in 2017.

But Merkel's spokesman and party colleagues have denied speculation about how long she would stay in office, with one saying she would be the 'least likely' of all of Europe's leaders to step down early.

If Merkel did step down, she would be the first German Chancellor to do so since 1949.

Such a move would come as a major shock in Germany, where has been in power for almost nine years, and be felt across Europe, where her position as the continent's most powerful leader is undisputed.

Mrs Merkel grew up in a rural area outside Berlin in the communist east, and showed a great talent for maths, science and languages.

1954: Born Hamburg

1978: Earns physics doctorate

1990: Joins CDU

1994: Becomes minister for environment

2000: Becomes CDU leader

2005: Becomes chancellor

2009: Re-elected chancellor

2013: Re-elected chancellor for second time

She earned a doctorate in physics but later worked as a chemist at a scientific academy in East Berlin.

She had never been involved in politics but, at the age of 36, she joined the burgeoning democracy movement in 1989 and, after the Berlin Wall came down, she got a job as government spokeswoman following the first democratic elections.

She joined the CDU, the party she now leads, two months before the reunification of Germany and within three months she was in the Kohl cabinet as minister for women and youth.

She quickly established herself in the party, rising through the ranks until she was chosen to lead it in 2000 and was elected Germany's first female chancellor in 2005.

The Chancellor received a ringing endorsement from voters in last year's
 elections, when she promised to serve a full term, winning 311 seats 
for the CDU party and a bigger share of the vote than in 200.

Now Forbes magazine ranks Mrs Merkel as the second most powerful person in the world - the highest position ever held by a woman.

If Mrs Merkel does resign as German chancellor, her successor is widely expected to be Ursula von der Leyen, the first woman to serve as German defence minister.

When Mrs Merkel appointed her last year it was seen as the anointing of her eventual successor, but Ms von der Leyen has been a controversial choice, both criticised and ridiculed for introducing army crèches and flexible working hours to make the military more appealing as a career.
