The man who discovered the second Boston Marathon bomber hiding out inside his boat got choked up when talking about the victims of the deadly blasts.

David Henneberry dismisses claims that he is a national hero, saying that if anything, he is an 'incidental hero'.

'It makes me feel wonderful that people that are thinking like that, but it is my boat. People lost lives and lost limbs,' Mr Henneberry told local station WCVB.

His role in the saga came when he walked outside of his Watertown home early Friday evening after the shelter-in-place order was lifted in Boston, and the first place he went was to check his boat, that he calls 'my baby'.

Earlier in the day, when he was still indoors, Mr Henneberry noticed that two of the pads that he puts in between the shrink wrap and his boat in order to prevent chaffing had fallen out of place.

'It was really windy, so I didn't think twice about it,' he said.

As he tells it, the 66-year-old was not expecting to find anything out of the ordinary when he went to adjust the pads. 

'Go out and get some air. I am just going to put the pads back. They were bugging me all day.  So I went out in the yard and felt the freedom that everyone is Watertown was feeling. When I pulled the strap, it was a lot looser than it usually is.  But again, the wind could have loosened things up,' he told WCVB.

Damage: The boat is effectively ruined after the bullets and fire it took when police were getting the suspect out of his makeshift hide out on Friday evening

Caught: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, was caught in the boat shortly after the shelter-in-place order was lifted by police on Friday evening following a day-long manhunt

Hand off: After realizing that a body was inside, Mr Henneberry immediately called 911

Even when he saw 'a good amount' of blood on the inside of the cabin, he initially doubted himself, thinking back to whether he had accidentally been cut when he was inside the boat weeks earlier.

Emotional: Mr Henneberry got choked up while talking about the victims who lost their lives, and others who lost limbs, in the bombing

'And I looked back and forth a couple of times and my eyes went to the engine block and there was a body,' he said.

He then ran back to his house and called the police, who immediately took over the scene. Mr Henneberry and his wife remain displaced from their home as investigators continue to comb over the boat and the property for clues.

'We had great sight and cover on what we had in the boat,' Boston Police Superintendant William Evans said in a Tuesday evening press conference.

'It was just a matter of holding until the tactical team came in to get him out.'

Police did in fact find the second bombing suspect inside the boat, ironically named the 'Slip Away II'.

Dzhokhar
Tsarnaev, 19, was taken into police custody and transported to Beth 
Israel Hospital for treatment from various wounds likely sustained from 
the early Friday morning altercation with police, where his older 
brother Tamerlan was killed.

'Slip Away is slipping away. But I say it
did its job. It held a bad guy and is going away like a Viking ship,' 
Mr Henneberry said to WCVB.

Tracking: Police used infared cameras to track exactly where the suspect was hiding before they approached

Warning: Mr Henneberry said that he saw a 'good amount' of blood in the cabin, and then a body

He also said that he is aware of a social media campaign where supporters are raising money to buy him a new boat after his was damaged in the apprehension of Tsarnaev. Instead, Mr Henneberry wants people to donate to a fund set up for those who were injured in last Monday's bombing.

'I am lucky I am alive.  These other people were killed.  Sometimes, I just sit and say, "Wow,"' he said.

'This hits you more afterwards when you think “My God, we probably slept last night, this guy could be in the (boat)… It’s surreal.’

Mr Henneberry's first interview comes as more continues to be revealed about the bombers and their family.

'Crude bombs': Both of the bombs were small, likely homemade devices and initial tests showed no C-4 or other high-grade explosive material

Terror Attack: The two detonations went off near
the finish line of the 117th Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 -

time since 9/11

Suspects: Dzhokhar, right, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev are accused of planting the Boston bombs last Monday

Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev apparently used an online magazine produced by al Qaeda as their guide for how to make the pressure cooker bombs that they set off at the finish line of last week's race, killing three and injuring more than 180 others.

There were reports today that the 19-year-old confessed to the FBI that he and his brother were the ones behind the bombing and that they acted alone.

He also reportedly said that they were driven to commit the attack because of their feelings against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Dzhokhar remains in a Boston hospital but he is expected to be transported in the next few days as his condition was downgraded from 'serious' to 'fair'.

He sustained unspecified damages during the course of the last week, most likely from the firefight with police on Friday morning that led to the death of his brother.

Dzhokhar is reportedly telling investigators that the deadly attacks were spearheaded by his brother, Tamerlan, who is thought to be the more radical of the two.

Tamerlan, a 26-year-old father of one, allegedly went through fits of rage, both verbally and physically abusing his wife who he called a 'slut and a prostitute'.

Federal investigators have already questioned his wife, 24-year-old Katherine Russell, and the brothers' parents are thought to be on their way to America for questioning from their native Russia.

It was revealed earlier today that no relatives have claimed Tamerlan's body.
