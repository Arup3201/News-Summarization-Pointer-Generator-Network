Back to jail: Derryn Hinch will serve 50 days in jail for revealing the criminal history of Jill Meagher's killer

Outspoken broadcaster Derryn Hinch was today arrested and could face 50 days in jail after breaking a court order to publish details about Jill Meagher’s killer.

The 69-year-old, known as the Human Headline, was found guilty of contempt of court in October and told he had 90 days to pay a $100,000 fine or be locked up.

In an article published on his website today, Hinch wrote that he was opting to go to prison to send a message about the legal system.

'I am not paying the $100,000 fine on principle. Not because I cannot afford it… I am electing to go to jail for 50 days to protest against a court system which sees rapists and murderers let out on parole to rape and kill again,' he wrote.

The veteran broadcaster, who will turn 70 while he is behind bars, was arrested at home in St Kilda, Victoria, this morning.

Hinch revealed that Adrian Ernest Bayley was on parole at the time of Ms Meagher’s murder while his trial was taking place last April.

Jill Meagher, a 29-year-old Irish woman, was raped and murdered while walking home from a pub in Brunswick, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, in September 2012.

In the week following her disappearance, Adrian Ernest Bayley was arrested and led police to where he had buried Ms Meagher's body. He pleaded guilty to her rape and murder in April 2013.

At Bayley's trial it was revealed that he has an extensive history of sexual violence and had been on parole at the time he murdered Ms Meagher.

While sentencing Hinch last October, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Kaye said that publishing material that reflected adversely on Bayley’s character was a ‘serious infraction’.

He added that it had interfered with the administration of justice by encouraging a 'trial by media.'

Hinch has been convicted for contempt of court or related offences six times.

He has spent his entire career campaigning against what he views as an overly lenient judiciary and the public’s right to know sensitive information about defendants.

He served 12 days in jail in 1987 for naming Michael Glennon as a paedophile priest while Glennon was awaiting trial.

In 2011 he was sentenced to five months’ home detention for breaching court orders and naming two sex offenders at a public rally. In that case, Hinch avoided a prison sentence because he had received a liver transplant just two weeks before the sentence was handed down.

Hinch says this is not a decision that he has taken lightly.

'It’s scary,' Hinch told the Herald Sun. 'For anyone going inside, it’s scary. Twelve days was scary. Fifty is going to be tough.'

When he was fined in October, Justice Kaye said Hinch’s media campaigns could make him unpopular with some inmates.

The broadcaster, who is worth $1.18million and earns $212,000 a year, wants to be put in maximum security prison, which he believes will be safer.

'If I get maximum security I’ll do 23 hours a day in isolation and one hour out in the exercise yard,' he told The Herald Sun.

'Right now, I feel good. I know I am doing the right thing. I am not scared for my safety,' he wrote on his website today.

'Although when a senior homicide squad member reassured me [that he would be safe in maximum security prison], I mentioned two words. One was ‘Carl’ and the other was ‘Williams’. He was in maximum security, under police protection and CCTV observation 24/7. And it didn’t save him.'

Gangland boss Carl Williams was beaten to death by another inmate with the seat pole from an exercise bike in April 2010.

Hinch, a former newspaper editor, quipped in his farewell article, 'I guess I’ll stay away from the exercise bikes.'
