Geoff Parling returns to the England starting line-up on Saturday with a clear vision of what is required — title glory, nothing less.

Leicester’s Lions lock resumes his role as the team’s lineout conductor and a vocal leader offering support to captain Chris Robshaw, having overcome concussion and knee injuries which blighted a large chunk of his season. 

The 31-year-old will commit body and soul to the RBS 6 Nations finale against France with an acute sense of England’s need to reach a fresh peak and replace fading highlights.

Geoff Parling is one of only five survivors from England's 38-21 victory against New Zealand in 2012 

England’s 38-21 win over world champions New Zealand at Twickenham in December 2012 is widely considered Stuart Lancaster’s finest hour. But, just over two years on, only five of that starting XV are set to start against France...

Despite their best endeavours in the championship, England’s most eye-catching achievement under Stuart Lancaster remains the record 38-21 demolition of New Zealand. But that historic victory took place 27 months ago and Parling — a central figure on that heady day — craves a more substantial achievement.

‘After that New Zealand game I was obviously over the moon, but it was a one-off,’ he said, after being recalled in place of Bath’s Dave Attwood.

‘We need something tangible now to say, “Look, we’ve won the championship, this is what we’ve got for our efforts — we can push on now with the goal of consistently beating any team that comes our way”. This is a game with the championship on the line in which we need to show character.’

Parling feels that won’t be a problem. He believes the England squad contains plenty of men who have an abundance of the necessary character and fighting spirit; men ready for the sort of taxing assignment that awaits tomorrow.

‘There are a lot of players who enjoy those moments when you feel your backs are against the wall,’ he said. ‘These games are when you see a team’s character. We know there is a lot of pressure and we shouldn’t hide away from that.

‘We said at the start of the tournament: we have to win it. We’ve come second three years running and we don’t want that feeling again, but we’ve got a chance here to put things right and win it.

‘We are good enough, with good enough players. The way we’ve been progressing and with the players we’ve got, it’s still within our control to win a championship and I think we should put the pressure on ourselves to not accept anything less.’

Parling became a stalwart of the Lions’ series triumph against Australia in the summer of 2013, playing in all three Tests, starting in two of them and excelling in that exalted company. That tour gave him a first-hand view of the talent available to Ireland and Wales, who are vying with England for this year’s championship title, but he is adamant Lancaster’s squad contains talent to compare with their more established rivals.

He said: ‘I see guys like George Ford and the way he controls the game at 22. He comes across as so much more experienced. I see the talent in JJ (Jonathan Joseph) and Anthony Watson. We have definitely got enough talent to win it.’

On a personal level, this is a welcome return to the starting XV for a player who has been a fixture throughout Lancaster’s tenure and would have won more than his 22 England caps but for injuries.

‘I am chuffed to be playing again, but I also see it as the start of the hard work. I haven’t done anything yet,’ said Parling. ‘I played every game between the autumn internationals and the Six Nations, then got the knee injury in the last game before meeting up, which was frustrating.

‘Then I thought I might be fine, but probably pushed it too hard.’

England will need full back Mike Brown at his attacking best against Les Blues at Twickenham 

His exploits as a replacement in the win over Scotland convinced the management that Parling was worthy of a place alongside Courtney Lawes at the heart of the pack in the only change to the starting line-up for a high-stakes instalment of ‘Le Crunch’.

Lancaster said: ‘The experience Geoff brings is important. He didn’t go on the Lions tour by accident. He’s been a high-quality player. Geoff has presence and speed around the field. His ability carrying the ball is excellent.’

England’s head coach was asked if he would feel any joy in beating the French but not claiming the title. ‘Eventually — potentially,’ he said. ‘But I don’t think I’ll feel anything other than disappointment if we don’t achieve it.’

Nothing less than glory will suffice.
