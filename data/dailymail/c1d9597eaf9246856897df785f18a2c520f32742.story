Not cool: Phil Hollister, 53, the operator of a 
Mr Ding-A-Ling ice cream truck in upstate New York, was arrested on a 
DUI charge and later fired

Phil Hollister, from upstate New York, now has a snowball's chance in hell of getting back behind the wheel of his Mr Ding-A-Ling ice cream truck following a DUI arrest.

Hollister, of Gloversville, was pulled over in his truck shortly after midnight Saturday on suspicion of driving under the influence.

A test has revealed that the 53-year-old had a blood-alcohol level of .15 per cent, or nearly twice the legal limit, Albany Times Union reported.

Mr Ding-A-Ling's owner has since fired Hollister and took back the truck.

Hollister made national news in April when he accused the operators of a rival ice cream truck, Sno Kone Joe, of harassing him.

The bellicose ice cream vendor may have won the battle against his arch-enemies, who have been charged with harassment and stripped of their city permit, but ultimately he lost the war.

At around 12.10am Saturday, Hollister nearly crashed his 2-ton truck into the cruiser of a Fulton County Sheriff's deputy on Route 123.

Earlier in the night, the 53-year-old was selling sweet, cold treats at a local fireworks show. Afterwards, Hollister said that he ducked into a bar, where he downed three or four cocktails in 30 minutes before getting back on the road.

Mr Hollister was arrested on a DUI charge after failing a sobriety test. He is due back in court August 15.

Meanwhile, the hapless ice cream man has been frozen out by his boss, Brian Collis.

The
owner of Mr Ding-A-Ling said that he will hire another driver to 
replace Hollister on his route covering Futlon and Montgomery counties.

Hollister's
stint behind the wheel of the Mr Ding-A-Ling ice cream truck may have 
only lasted five months, but it was filled with headline-grabbing drama.

In April, Hollister complained to police that Sno Kone Joe operator Joshua Malatino was making threats, including yelling things like ‘you don’t have a chance.'

Hollister claimed Malatino, along with
his girlfriend Amanda Scott, 21, also tried to intimidate him by 
stalking him around town in their own ice cream truck, blasting their 
music loudly when near him, and yelling ‘free ice cream!’ when they saw 
someone approaching the Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck.

‘I
own this town,’ Malatino allegedly yelled in a phone call to Mr. 
Ding-A-Ling headquarters, where he claimed Gloversville as his ice cream
turf and nobody else’s.

On April 19, Gloversville police witnessed Malatino’s harassment while on patrol. An officer saw a Sno Cone Joe truck tailgating a Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck at a red light, even though Police Capt. John Sira said that the 34-year-old had been warned in the past about this type of behavior.

Police investigated the case and on April 30, Malatino and Scott were arrested on charges of harassment and misdemeanor stalking on three separate occasions.

Following a lengthy court battle between the Albany-based Sno Kone King and Mr. Ding-A-Ling, Malatino's company has lost its permit in Gloversville.

Gloversville Mayor Dayton King told the station CBS 6 Albany that Collis will be able to keep his permit so long as Hollister is kept away from his trucks.

Malatino and Scott are due back in court July 29 to face their charges of harassment.

Sweet deal: Hollister, pictured, said Malatino even offered free ice cream to people who approached the Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck

Victor? The owner of Mr. Ding-A-Ling said his truck will continue working the streets of Gloversville in spite of the upset

During the drawn-out legal battle 
between the two rivals, Sno Kone Joe's lawyers showed a video, which 
reportedly depicted Hollister dancing to their truck’s music and 
flipping off the drivers in full view of young customers.

For his part, the 53-year-old newly unemployed man said that he is now looking to get into the home remodelling business.
