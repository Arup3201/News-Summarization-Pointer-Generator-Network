Edinson Cavani sounded a warning to England to beware a Uruguay team on the rebound from their humbling by Costa Rica and with Luis Suarez back in their line-up.

Suarez, who completed a full training session on Wednesday, is expected to start his first game since minor knee surgery a month ago, and could even return with the captain’s armband in the absence of the injured Diego Lugano.

He will reform his formidable strike partnership with Cavani —  the £56million Paris Saint- Germain star who used the eve-of-game press conference at Sao Paulo’s Arena Corinthians to remind the world of the Uruguayan spirit.

Warrior spirit: Edinson Cavani is still up for a battle

‘Our message is always the same,’ said Cavani. ‘We are difficult to beat, we have strong character and strong personality and if you want to win against us you have to fight.

‘We have thought a lot about why we lost against Costa Rica. It was difficult to accept, not because we thought they were easy — we respected them — but we were playing well and we thought we would start the competition on the right foot.

‘Losing is never nice. We know we lost because we made mistakes. We have seen it, analysed it and we are convinced it was our fault. We have the tools to react. We are ready to face this  situation. We have overcome similar situations before.’

Uruguay’s experienced manager Oscar Tabarez projected a calm confidence in a team which has achieved considerable success. His players were semi-finalists in South Africa four years ago, they won the Copa America in 2011 and reached the last four in last year’s Confederations Cup.

They stumbled in the qualifying campaign for this tournament but few expected them to lose 3-1 to Costa Rica in their first Group D fixture on Saturday.

‘Motivation is always a personal process,’ said Tabarez. ‘I lead this team but they won’t achieve  anything if they don’t want it for themselves. We are a team always willing to fight and recover.

‘When you lose a game you have two choices: give in or keep united, react and recover. That’s what we’ve always done.

‘We are worried that we lost and started the World Cup with a defeat because this has an impact on our chances to go through, but this is not over yet.

‘We have two games to play. Two teams will meet who both need to win. One will stay in and the other has very little chance to continue. We have to be convinced we will reach our aims.

‘We’ve had similar situations where we had negative results and we overcame the situation. It doesn’t mean we will make it but we know our team always fights until the end. My objective is to beat England and continue in the World Cup. If we win this game, we will be really strong.’

Uruguay will be without two of their usual back four. Lugano has a knee problem and Maxi Pereira is suspended, but Tabarez said he was not tempted to change tactics.

Rolling the dice: Oscar Tabarez is ready to gamble on Suarez's fitness

Far more important will be the return of Suarez, Uruguay’s record goalscorer, and his physical  condition.

‘I have often played with Luis and we have done wonderful things together,’ said Cavani, who put in a light training stint. Tabarez, however, admits there is inevitable risk involved.

‘Luis has recovered well,’ said the 67-year-old manager. ‘His knee seems to have adapted to the  work he’s been doing. He’s been training and playing with his  team-mates during this last week.

‘So, he was able to train but we know a training session is not the same as a match. If he plays we must consider the possibility that he’s not as well as he was during the Premier League.  

All smiles: Suarez is expected to go straight into the side to face England

'But, even when he is not 100 per cent, he is someone who can give a lot to his team. That’s what we’re considering right now.

‘Luis has always wanted to face all the challenges in his career. Not only playing for the national team but in other situations. Any time we have needed him in any sort of match he has been willing. He has always improved himself and his career is wonderful, brilliant.

‘He plays in one of best leagues in the world and has overcome many different problems. He is a very important player for us because of his technical abilities and his personality.’
