Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum said on Monday night that he is 'not sure' if Republicans care about poor people as much as Democrats do.

'If you really cared you'd talk about the problems they have,' Santorum told a group of conservatives at the New York meeting on Monday evening.

'If you really cared [about poor people'] you'd talk about the problems they have,' Former Sen. Rick Santorum told a group of conservatives at the New York meeting on Monday evening

The New York Meeting is a monthly gathering organized by Mallory Factor, a New
 York Times best-selling author and instructor at the Citadel in South 
Carolina.

Santorum was at the event to promote his new book, Blue Collar Conservatives, which was released that day.

In the book Santorum lays out problems facing 'working Americans,' an issue he expounded on Monday night.

During the Q and A portion of Santorum's remarks, the 2012 presidential candidate was asked whether or not he supports the Earned Income Tax Credit, a wage supplement for low-income Americans. The IRS says it refunded more than $63 million to 27 million people in 2013 under this provision.

Republicans often prefer an expansion of the EITC to a minimum wage increase because it takes the burden off of employers to pay their workers more and places it on the government to give poor people more of their hard-earned money back.

It has been expanded by every president since Ronald Reagan, and another expansion of the tax credit is included in Obama's recently released annual budget.

'The earned income tax credit is a good idea. There are things we need to do to reward work,' Santorum said. 'We need to talk about work. We need to talk about the importance of work.'

He said he generally dislikes the way the government's entitlement programs work because they create a disincentive to work, though.

'Wonder why people feel trapped in welfare? It's because you lose money the more money you make,' he said.

'Let me tell you another thing that you lose. You lose the ability to marry.'

Santorum then proceeded to explain how the welfare program in Wisconsin works, according to a state senator he met there when he was campaigning for president. In Wisconsin, he said, a single mother who has two children and earns $15,000 a year qualifies for $38,000 a year in welfare benefits.

If she gets married, she would lose it all, Santorum said.

'We trap people in dangerous relationships,' Santorum said, referring to the U.S. government. 'It's not because single moms don't have relationships -  of course many of them do - many of them actually have cohabitating relationships, which are incredibly dangerous, not just for the mother but for the children, and government does that.'

That's when he launched into his attack an attack on the Republican Party.

'We [Republicans] don't talk about this because – well, people ask me, "Do Republicans care as much about the poor as Democrats do?" I'm not sure we do. I'm not sure we do.'

'And the reason I'm not sure we do is because I don't hear us talking about it very often. And if you really cared you'd talk about the problems they have.'

House Budget Committee Chair and 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan and Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida have voiced their support of the EITC or similar programs within the last few months. Rubio even made the creation of a new, similar program – one without restrictions on childless applicants – the focal point of a major poverty speech earlier this year.
