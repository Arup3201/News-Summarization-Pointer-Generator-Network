It was supposed to fill Downing Street with Christmas cheer.

But as David Cameron turned on the festive lights outside Number 10 he found himself looking more like the Grinch Who Stole Christmas than the bringer of good tidings.

When the Prime Minister crouched down to speak to some children next to the tree, the lights festooned from the branches bathed his face in an eerie green glow, just like the Dr Seuss character.

The scene was reminiscent of the 2000 film in which six-year-old Cindy Lou (Taylor Momsen) teaches the Christmas-hating Grinch, played by actor Jim Carrey, about the true meaning of the festive season

Mr Cameron was joined by wife Samantha for the big switch on, which was also attended by a number of young military cadets and the growers who took part in a competition to provide the tree.

The 20ft Nordman fir which took ten years to grow, was hand-picked by farmer Colin Griffith after he won a competition back in October.

Mr Griffith, who owns Dinmore Hill Trees at Festive Farm in Wellington, Hereford, won grower of the year at the British Christmas Tree Growers Association awards.

Runner up Rob Morgan, from Swansea, had the honour of providing a smaller 11 and a half foot tree for the pillared room inside Downing Street, while Brian Taylor, also from Hereford, has provided the wreath for the door.

Workers had to use a cherry picker to put up the large tree and decorate it with the large lights and silver baubles, as well as hundreds of smaller LED fairy lights, with the reflection from the branches giving it a green hue. 

The decorations have been used every year since the coalition came to power in 2010.

Nordman Firs - such as the one outside Number 10 - are the UK’s most popular Christmas trees

Nordman Firs - such as the one outside Number 10 - are the UK’s most popular Christmas trees and originate from the mountains on either side of the Black Sea, primarily in Turkey and Georgia.

The tree itself is a 20ft Nordman fir, the most popular kind of tree in the UK, which took ten years to

They are favoured for the dark green, glossy needles and neat, conical shape which makes them easy to decorate. The needles are also slow to drop off, even after the pine has dried out.

This is different to the Norwegian spruce that usually adorns Trafalgar Square which is sent over every year from Oslo as a token of thanks for our assistance during the Second World War. 

It typically stands between 60 and 70ft tall, and and is chosen months, or even years in advance.

The tree, dubbed 'the queen of the forest,' is cut down during a special ceremony attended by the Lord Mayor of Westminster, the British ambassador to Norway and the Mayor of Oslo.
