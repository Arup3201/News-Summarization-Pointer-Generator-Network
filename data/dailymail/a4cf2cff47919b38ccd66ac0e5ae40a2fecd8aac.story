Jesus Christ taught about the importance of people paying their tax, the Archbishop of Canterbury claimed today. 

The Most Rev Justin Welby said companies and people should pay their 'fair share' in the country where they had made their money, but part of the problem was an 'unbelievably complex' tax system.

The remarks will be seen as a highly political intervention as David Cameron and Ed Miliband clashed in the Commons over tax avoidance.

The Most Rev Justin Welby said companies and people should pay their 'fair share' in the country where they had made their money

Dr Welby, a former oil executive, said business was important and should be supported but there was a temptation to misuse the power that came through wealth.

He told the BBC: 'There has always been the principle that you pay tax where you earn the money. If you earn money in a particular country, the revenue service of that country needs to get a fair share of what you have earned.'

Highlighting the complexities of the international tax system, he said: 'Someone said the other day that the tax system was of biblical proportions. Well, the Bible's only a thousand pages - how many tax systems are only a thousand pages? They are several hundred times that.

'There needs to be simplification in tax so that people are responsible in the right place.'

He added that there was a 'very basic principle' that 'as a Christian we see that Jesus Christ spoke of, about the importance of people paying what is due'.

'The Bible speaks of it endlessly,' he said.

It is the Archbishop's latest intervention on economic matters, having spoken out about inequality in recent weeks.

He stressed that 'business is important', adding: 'We need to affirm the significance of those who generate and create wealth, but we also need to be realistic about the fact ... that with wealth comes power and with power comes a temptation to misuse power.

'There's a reality of the human condition, of what Christians call sin, what the Bible calls sin, which says don't misuse the power you have got through wealth.'

Asked whether some people were doing that he said: 'There's always elements where that happens, because people are people.'

But the response to that was not to 'throw the baby out with the bathwater and say that business is bad' - instead, 'solidarity' and an improved regulatory framework were required. 

At Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron and Ed Miliband clashed in the Commons over tax avoidance

At Prime Minister's Questions,  Mr Miliband accused the Prime Minister of failing to act to close a tax loophole for hedge funds because 'too many of his friends would get caught in the net'.

He repeatedly pressed the Prime Minister to close the tax loophole which allowed hedge funds to avoid stamp duty on stock-market transactions 'costing hundreds of millions of pounds'.

The Labour leader claimed: 'This is a Prime Minister who won't tackle tax avoidance for the simple reason that too many of his friends would get caught in the net.

'They are the party of Mayfair hedge funds and Monaco tax avoiders and under him you will always know it's one rule for those at the top and another rule for everyone else.' 

But Mr Cameron hit back: 'When we came to office foreigners didn't pay stamp duty on the properties they bought. Foreigners didn't pay capital gains tax on the properties they bought.

'And because of your tax rates City hedge fund managers were paying lower tax rates than the people who cleaned their offices. That's what we had to sort out.'
