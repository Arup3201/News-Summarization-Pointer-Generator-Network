A super-fan has spent a whopping £10,000 on what could be the UK's biggest Dolly Parton collection - including CDs, magazines and life-size cutouts of the singer herself.

Obsessed Joe Skelly, 46, a retail manager from Cockermouth, Cumbria, bought his first Dolly Parton CD at the age of just eight years old, and instantly fell in love with the queen of country music.

Since then, he has dedicated his life to the singer, spending thousands on his impressive collection - but he insists the memorabilia is 'priceless'.

Joe has even been lucky enough to meet his idol, and travelled all the way to Dolly's home state of Tennessee to visit the Dollywood theme park.

Despite his collection filling every nook and cranny of his idyllic Cumbrian cottage, Joe is always on the hunt for new items. 

'I absolutely love Dolly and everything she stands for,' he said of the 69-year-old performer. 'My collection started off with a few CDs, and before I knew it I had everything that she's ever recorded.'

He added: 'It grew from there and I now I have all sorts of Dolly memorabilia - from books and movies to jigsaws and teapots.'

In 2002, Joe finally met the object of his obsession, and it exceeded all his expectations. 'When I met her it was the best day of my life, she was so warm and welcoming,' he said.

'Some people do get a bit surprised by the Dolly cut out in the window of the cottage, but everybody knows I'm her number one fan - I'm always getting Dolly related stuff for my birthdays and Christmas - I love it.'

As a child, Joe kept his love of Dolly a secret due to being raised in a strict religious environment until he moved out as a teenager.  

'Listening to popular music wasn't really the done thing in my house as a child,' he explained.

'I used to play Dolly's CDs in secret over and over again and I kept any memorabilia in a draw so that no one could see it. I'd go to record stores and just buy anything that was available.'

Once he moved out, his obsession became even stronger. 'As soon as I left home, I had more freedom so I started to build my collection and it just grew and grew.

'Now I've got about 150 CDs, 50 books, every album she's ever released including compilations and re-releases, posters, photographs, drawings, mugs, lunchboxes, T-shirts, jumpers - everything you can get.

'I've spent a lot of money over the years - about £10,000 - but to me my collection is priceless.'

It wasn't until 2002 that Joe finally saw his idol perform in concert, when Dolly came over for a nine date tour of the UK.

Joe attended all nine concerts, and was even invited to meet Dolly in her dressing room after a concert.

'She was dressed head to toe in gold and was just so lovely,' Joe remembered. 'I gave her some flowers and she signed a few CDs - it was very sweet of her to take time out of her day to do that.

'I was on a total high for days afterwards.

'Since then I've met Dolly a few more times, and I'll always sit in the audiences of chat shows that she appears on. 

Joe has now founded the Dolly Parton Fan Club - Dolly Part'ners UK for like-minded British people

'She even recognises now and knows me by name, it's wonderful.'

The most expensive item in Joe's giant collection is a set of rare original recordings.

The much sought after recordings cost Joe a cool £2,000 - but he says they're well worth the hefty price tag.

He said: 'I'd been on the hunt for the recordings for ages, so when I got my hands on them it was great.

'But my favourite piece in the collection is actually an album called Real Love that is signed by Dolly herself.

'I just love the album and the fact that she's signed it is really special.'

Joe's love of the country singer isn't unsual, his fan club Dolly Part'ners UK now  has hundreds of members

Joe, along with a friend, has even set up the UK's top Dolly Parton Fan Club - Dolly Part'ners UK.

The club, which was started in 1997, now has hundreds of members from across the UK.

Joe said: 'I was looking for a fan club to join and realised that there wasn't really an active one in the UK - so I decided to set one up myself.

'At first it was just a newsletter that people could sign up to that talked about the latest Dolly releases.

'But now we have a full blown website - it's great to think we're helping Dolly share her amazing music.'
