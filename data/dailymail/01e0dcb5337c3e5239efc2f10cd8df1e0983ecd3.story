Celebrity defense attorney Dominic Barbara has been accused of stalking, harassing and attempting to extort his ex-wife, Leslie Barbara, by threatening to file false police reports and a false order of protection against her.

Nassau County, Long Island police arrested him on Tuesday and brought him to court, where he served as his own lawyer.

The 67-year-old attorney who has represented high-profile defendants, including Joey Buttafuoco and the husband of the woman who killed eight people when she drove her minivan the wrong way on the Taconic Parkway, has been charged with attempted grand larceny, aggravated harassment and stalking.

Now self-defending: Celebrity lawyer Dominic Barbara has been arrested and charged with harassment, stalking, and attempting to extort $200,000 from his ex-wife

Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice said Mr Barbara threatened to expose details of his ex-wife’s alleged sexual relationships, disclose compromising photos and videos, and hold a press conference about the men he claimed she had slept with, unless she gave him $200,000.

‘My ex-wife and I have been the shame of this court,’ Mr Barbara told the judge before pleading not guilty. ‘I have nothing to do with this woman.’

Ms Rice said that Mr Barbara texted and called his ex-wife multiple times between March and September at first asking for $10,000.

When she refused, Ms Rice said that Mr Barbara began to barrage his ex-wife with threatening calls and texts designed to destroy her reputation and career.

The threats continued after the disgraced lawyer was told to stop, Ms Rice said.

Mr Barbara has also been accused of threatening to file a false civil complaint and an order of protection against his ex-wife.

He texted and called his ex-wife’s friends, clients and business partner in an effort to get her to meet his demands, Ms Rice said.

Mr Barbara was arrested in a separate case in September for violating an order of protection by trying to contact his ex-wife through a third party.

Barbara, who has been photographed in the past wearing $1,000 suits, said he was now sleeping on a friend’s couch.

He faces up to one year in jail if convicted of the latest charges.
