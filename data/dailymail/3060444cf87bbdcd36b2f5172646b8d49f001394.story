A Saudi diplomat has been accused of keeping two trafficked women as domestic help in his home, racially discriminating against them, and denying them wages.

An employment tribunal heard that Jarallah Al-Malki and his wife allegedly paid Cherrylyn Reyes, a Filipino, and Tinitn Rohaetin Suryadi, an Indonesian, less than minimum wage and denied them holiday pay.

They also allegedly failed to give them a statement of particulars of employment and an itemised pay statement.

Immunity: Jarallah Mal-Malki may not have to answer claims against him because he is a member of the Saudi diplomatic mission in the UK, whose Mayfair embassy is pictured

Both women say that they were 
trafficked, and had letters from the UK Border Agency which said there 
were 'reasonable grounds to believe' that this was the case.

However,
Mr Al-Malki and his wife may not have to answer the claims after 
winning an appeal which allows them to claim diplomatic immunity.

Ms Reyes worked at the Al-Malkis's home from 18 January 2011 until 14 March 2011, and Ms SuryadiÂ  from 16 May 2011 until 19 September 2011.

But the women's claims will go unanswered, unless the women take their case to the Court of Appeal and have the ruling overturned.

Decision: Ms Reyes and Ms Suryadi have been allowed to take their case to the Court of Appeal, which could rule that Mr Al-Malki's diplomatic immunity does not apply

An appeal tribunal judge has allowed lawyers to ask for judges to decide whether the Mr Al-Malki's diplomatic immunity can be overruled on human rights grounds - because it would deny the women access to a court.

The official decision from the appeal judge concluded that 'The Tribunal was wrong 
to conclude that the plea of diplomatic immunity was no bar to the 
claims.

'The appeal against the conclusion... and the cross-appeal arguing there has been a breach of [the European Convention on Human Rights]... 
are both dismissed.'

The Saudi embassy tonight declined to comment on the allegations.
