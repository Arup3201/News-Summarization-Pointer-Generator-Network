You may imagine that a man who is adept at housework would be attractive to woman.

But sociologists claim that mopping the kitchen and washing up dishes won’t help men get lucky in the bedroom - with middle-aged women at least.

A study has found that men who regularly do housework, such as cooking and cleaning, have less sex than men who don’t bother.

Researchers from the Juan March Institute in Madrid studied data based on relationships of 4,561 middle-aged US couples over 20 years, including their sex lives and how they divide household chores.

The study, which was published in the journal American Sociological Review, found that home tasks such as cooking and cleaning are traditionally perceived as women’s work – and 80 per cent of housework is still done by females.

The results showed that men performed around 55 per cent of 'masculine' tasks such as paying bills and mowing the lawn.

While egalitarian marriages tended to be happier, men who did ‘feminine’ tasks had sex less often than those who shunned the iron and oven.

In fact, men who divorced themselves from core chores, had sex one and a half times more a month than those who pulled their weight in the home. 

Overall, couples had sex once a week.

Sabino Kornrich, a sociologist at the university, explained that gender stereotypes may linger in the home and could explain the results.

‘What we do in the house is really strongly tied to how people think of themselves as men or women or as masculine or feminine,’ he told Live Science.

He explained that women may see men doing ‘feminine’ jobs as less sexually attractive.

Alternatively, couples with similar roles may feel more like siblings than lovers, he added.

Dr Pepper Schwartz, a sociologist at the University of Washington, who has also written relationship books but was not involved in the study, said: ‘That companionable part of the relationship turns out not to be so sexy.’

She believes that couples who share everything may be such good friends that they don’t need sex to communicate.

Constance Gager, a sociologist at Montclair State University in New Jersey cautions that the results may not apply to young couples who grew up in times when gender roles have largely changed.

She found the opposite applied – that when tasks are not seen as gender specific, men have more sex when they do more housework and another study has backed up her claims.

Men who do more household chores (stock image), are more satisfied in the bedroom than those who stick to ‘manly’ tasks, according to a 2013 study

Men who embrace their 'feminine side' around the house  have more satisfaction in the bedroom than those who stick to ‘manly’ chores like cutting the hedge and mowing the lawn, according to a 2013 study.

The quality of the sex they had was superior as well if they were prepared to do their share of cooking and cleaning, the scientists found.

The research by Cornell University contradicts the Washington study, but it used data on a similar number of families from 2006, arguably showing that attitudes have changed.

Professor Sharon Sassler said that using old data has skewed the Washington results because the couples had married in the 1960s and 70s when things were very different.

She said: ‘Couples who shared domestic labour had sex at least as often, and were at least as satisfied with the frequency and quality of their sex, as couples where the woman did the bulk of the housework.

‘In fact, these egalitarian partners were ranked slightly higher in all these categories, reporting more frequent sex and greater satisfaction with the frequency and quality of that sex than conventional couples.’

But a study looking at younger couples found the opposite is true
