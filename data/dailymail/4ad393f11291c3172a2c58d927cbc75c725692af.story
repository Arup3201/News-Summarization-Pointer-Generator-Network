Hours before he died in the early hours of Tuesday morning, award-winning journalist Michael Hastings sent an email to various colleagues saying his 'close friends and associates' were being interviewed by the FBI and that he needed to 'go off the radar' for a while.

The email also said he was onto a big story and advised his colleagues that if authorities arrived at BuzzFeed, Hastings' employer, they should consult lawyers before speaking to them.

In the subject line, Hastings wrote 'FBI Investigation re: NSA.' He sent the email to colleagues just before 1pm Monday and blind-copied in his friend, Staff Sergeant Joseph Biggs.

Onto something: The email Michael Hastings sent to colleagues and friend Staff Sergeant Joseph Biggs hours before his death in a fiery solo car crash

Biggs, who has known Hastings since 2008 when the journalist was embedded in his unit in Afghanistan, forwarded the message to KTLA.

'On Monday morning, I woke up and I got an email, and it’s very panicked,' Biggs told KTLA.

'It alarmed me very much. I just said it doesn’t seem like him. I don’t know, I just had this gut feeling and it just really bothered me,' he said.

KTLA's staff photographer was on the 
scene soon after the crash and caught footage of the crash's fiery 
aftermath. He also saw footage that 
shows him speeding through a red light. According to Lane, there was no 
one in pursuit.

'There’s
no cars that are following him,' Lane told KTLA. 'He flies by and 10 
seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds goes by… No cars are following him.'

LA
police have ruled the crash an accident, but even before the 
publication of this email conspiracy theories about the involvement of outside forces have grown.

Despite the claims in Hastings' email, the FBI has said the journalist was not being investigated.

Fueling
the suspicions, WikiLeaks posted a tweet on Wednesday claiming: 
'Michael Hastings death has a very serious non-public complication. We 
will have more details later.'

Three hours later the website claimed Mr Hastings had contacted their lawyer a few hours before he died.

Hastings was best known for a 2010 Rolling Stone article that led to the resignation of General Stanley McChrystal, who was the former U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan.

Hastings died in Los Angeles after the Mercedes C250 coupé he was driving slammed into a palm tree at high speed and exploded in flames. According to police, his body was burned beyond recognition.

His last published piece was about the widely reported NSA scandal for Buzzfeed, which ended, 'Perhaps more information will soon be forthcoming.'
