A Families SA driver has been charged with raping a teenaged girl in state care.

Less then a fortnight after revelations a Families SA worker was charged with sexually abusing seven children, police say they've arrested a 49-year-old man with links to the state organisation.

The driver, whose company was hired by Families SA, was arrested last Sunday night after he allegedly raped the girl that afternoon when he was driving her to her care home.

The man was bailed on conditions preventing him contacting or transporting children, and Families SA was told of his arrest on Monday.

Police have launched Operation Harlem and are combing the man's work history in a bid to identify if there are more alleged victims.

Families SA has told police it will notify the carers and relatives of all children who had contact with the driver.

Families SA is part of the Department for Education and Child Development.

They state on their website that, 'Our primary area of concern is the protection of children â€“ "keeping them safe". Within this context we work to protect children from abuse and harm.'

The latest arrest is another blow to the Department of Education and Child Development, after revelations an Adelaide childcare worker was charged with unlawful sexual intercourse with seven young children living at a residential care facility.

The department's deputy chief executive, David Waterford, quit on Monday after it emerged the 32-year-old worker had previously been investigated over claims he inappropriately dealt with a female toddler.

Mr Waterford and Child Development Minister Jennifer Rankine had earlier indicated there were no previous suspicious about the man.

Mr Waterford later admitted that he skimmed over key information, which caused him to accidentally mislead the minister and chief executive.
