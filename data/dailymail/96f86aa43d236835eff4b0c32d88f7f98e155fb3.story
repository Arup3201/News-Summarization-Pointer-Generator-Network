A lizard was forced to have an operation after eating a McDonald's happy meal toy which it had mistaken for a mouse. 

Keva, a two-year-old Bosc monitor lizard, was watching its owner's Jack Russell, Paddy, toss the furry object in the air as his vivarium was being cleaned. 

The reptile, whose species is known to prey on rodents in the wild, had to be rushed to the vets in Morpeth, Northumberland, after swallowing the tiny toy dog whole.

Keva, a two-year-old Bosc monitor lizard, was rushed to the vet in Northumberland after swallowing the toy 

The fluffy object became lodged in the reptile's stomach and had to be removed by an exotic animals expert 

Owner Victoria Ord from Haydon Bridge watched the reptile stretch up and grab the toy after watching it being thrown around. 

'The toy is Paddy’s favourite and he is so playful he flipped it up in the air hoping that Keva would join in and play with him.

'Keva obviously saw it move quickly and Bosc Monitors are used to catching food in the wild so he stretched up and grabbed it.

'He swallowed it down no problem at all. He didn’t have any breathing problems but I knew he would be unable to pass it so we had to get to the vets as soon as possible.

Keva's owner, Victoria Ord (centre) said she knew her pet would not be able to pass the object himself so rushed him to Robson & Prescott veterinary centre in Morpeth where Sam Prescott (left) was able to operate with the help of head nurse Laura Petts (right)

The toy could have killed Keva if it hadn't been removed sooner after becoming stuck in his stomach

Life and death situation: The lizard reclines before being operated on by specialists at the veterinary centre

'It was a very stressful journey as he could have choked.'

Vet Sam Prescott was able to extract the fluffy toy from the animal's abdomen before it caused any serious damage.  

'Bosc monitors have a rapacious appetite and varied diet, so mistaking a small furry toy for a small furry mouse was an easy mistake for Keva to make.

'The soft toy caused an obstruction that would have killed him if not operated on quickly, so it was a life-and-death situation.'
