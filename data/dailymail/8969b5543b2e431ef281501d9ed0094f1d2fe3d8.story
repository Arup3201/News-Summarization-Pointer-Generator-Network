Three sets of twins were born in a 24-hour period at the same New York hospital, breaking all records for twin delivery at the maternity in the same day. 

The six babies — all healthy and happy — were born between Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning at Hudson Valley Hospital Center in Cortland. 

The first pair, Viggo and Cormac, were born to parents Leeah and Brodie Hoyer on Tuesday afternoon.

'We are very fortunate,' said Leeah Hoyer, whose husband is an instructor at the US Military Academy at West Point, to The Journal News.

Viggo was born at 2:15pm and weighed 6 pounds, 7 ounces. His twin Carmac arrived nine minutes later weighing 6 pounds, 6 ounces. They join big sister Lorna, who will turn 2-years-old later this month.

Then on Wednesday morning came the second set of twins: baby girls Avery and Savanah, born one minute apart to parents Jacqueline and Kieran Miller, of Cortland Manor.

'[I’m] definitely nervous, but very excited that they’re here,' Jacqueline Miller told NBC New York. 

The new mom says this has been been 'an emotional rollercoaster' but the parents are 'thrilled'and can't wait to take their baby girls home.

'Everything is ready for them,' Kieran Miller told the Daily Voice. 'It's just amazing.'

Added Jacqueline Miller: 'We are thrilled to be new parents. We are excited for their next adventures.'

The third set of twins arrived a few hours later on Wednesday to Marie Giron and Herbert Martinez of Peekskill.

Dulce Maria was born weighing 4 pounds, 7 ounces. Her twin, Luisa Guadalupe, came into the world a minute later at 4 pounds, 8 ounces. The girls were born prematurely but are doing well. 

'I'm so happy. This is my year. It's very exciting,' gushed proud dad Herbert Martinez to the Daily Voice.

Herbert Martinez said his new daughters are his Christmas present. They join older siblings Daisy, 6, and Flavio, 4.

'Daisy is so happy, but Flavio wanted two boys,' Herbert Martinez told the Daily Voice.

Staff at the Hudson Valley Hospital Center were even more surprised because another set of twins had just been born there a week prior, also shattering the record for most twin births in a week there. 

Parents Stephanie and Steven Cangialosi, of Peekskill, welcomed girls Amanda and Emma on Nov. 26. 

Girls Emma Rose and Amanda Grace were born to Peekskill couple Stephanie and Cangialosi on Nov. 26.  Their birth brings to four the number of sets of twins that were born at the Cortland hospital in the same week

'To have three that came within a 24-hour time span, that’s really unusual and I think caught everybody by surprise,' OBGYN physician Megan Pierce told NBC New York.

In total, the hospital has received seven set of twins this year, including the four in the past week. 

'I don't know what happened with the moon,' Herbert Martinez quipped to the Journal News.
