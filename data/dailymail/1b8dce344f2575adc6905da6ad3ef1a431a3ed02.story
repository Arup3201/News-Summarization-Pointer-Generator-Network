Don't put the barbecue away just yet - August may be coming to an end today but forecasters say we're in for more sunshine and an Indian summer.

Britain has been enjoying more balmy weekend weather and it is set to get even hotter through next week.

After temperatures reached 22 degrees in the South East, they will creep up to 24 on Monday and may even hit 30 by Wednesday.

Dry: There has been almost half the total rainfall this summer compared to last year

The country is continuing to enjoy 
settled conditions thanks to the Azores Bermuda high pressure system 
which is extending over Britain from the Atlantic, said forecaster Byron
Chalcraft from the Met Office.

'It pushes the jet stream
further north which brings fine weather to the UK. It's pretty much 
extended over the country now and it looks like it's hanging around for a
while longer,' he said.

Windsurfers took advantage of the fantastic conditions at the Watersports Festival on Hayling Island in Hampshire. And there were plenty of punters on the River Cam in Cambridge basking in canal boats.

Today's hot weather comes after it was revealed Britain has sizzled in the warmest, driest and sunniest summer since 2006.

After a few washout summers, this year saw a settled June followed by a July heatwave and a sunny August.

The Met Office has revealed that between June 1 and August 28, the average temperature in the UK was 15.2C (59F) – just under the 15.78C (60F) figure recorded in 2006. 

A total of 189mm of rainfall was measured, 78 per cent of the UK average and half last summer’s total of 379mm.

In 2006, 188.3mm of rain was recorded, along with 601.5 hours of clear sunshine that was not blocked by any cloud.

That compares to 588 hours this summer, making it the seventh sunniest summertime since 1929.

Hotting up: Temperatures have reached as high as 22 degrees in parts of southern England

Still sunny: Forecasters say the warm temperatures are likely to continue and even increase through next week

Warm and dry: The summer has been the warmiest, sunniest and driest since 2006

But in a statement released yesterday, the Met Office said: ‘While this summer is warmer, drier and sunnier than the long-term average, it hasn’t been exceptional.

‘It stands out because the last six summers have been wetter than average, with 2012 and 2007 both being in the top five wettest, and 2008 and 2009 also in the top ten wettest in records from 1910.’

And while the 19-day July heatwave stood out as the most striking weather event of the season, the report said it was ‘more notable for its duration than the actual temperatures recorded’.

Indian summer: Forecasters predict that temperatures could rise to above 30C again before winter sets in

Dramatic: But they said that, far from being blisteringly hot, we have had the kind of summer we should have

The summer’s highest temperature was not during the heatwave but on August 1, when the mercury reached 34.1C (93F) at Heathrow – the highest in the UK since July 2006.

Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge said: ‘We’ve had the kind of summer we should have had, rather than the wet and cooler summers we have suffered in recent years.

‘There will be plenty of fine, dry weather for the south and South East next week - certainly warmer than normal for this time of the year. It could reach around 25C (77F)early in the week and perhaps a little warmer later next week.

'But it will only be a brief sunny interlude, with conditions becoming more unsettled and temperatures back to normal by the end of the week.’

Improvement: After five wetter than average summers, 2013 has proved to be a scorcher

Afternoon delight: Tourists have been out enjoying a boat trip on the River Cam in glorious sunshine

Basking: July's 19-day heatwave was a highlight although the highest temperature was on August 1

Blissful: The River Cam looked glorious again today with plenty of people taking advantage of the sunshine

Lazy river: The weather could not have been better for a punting trip

The unseasonal temperatures will be caused by an area of high pressure dominating England and Wales which will draw in warmer air from the continent.

MeteoGroup forecaster Alexi Boothman predicted temperatures of 27C (80.6F) in the South East on Wednesday, with the possibility it could go higher the following day.

She added: ‘The average temperature for the start of autumn in the South is 20C-21C (68F-69.8F) so it will be a good few degrees higher than average. But in the north temperatures could be up to ten degrees lower, much closer to the seasonal average in that part of the country.’

The Met Office said this summer was likely to finish around eighth to tenth warmest since 1910.

sunniest summer for seven years, with the heat set to continue into the 
autumn, according to forecasters

Hot stuff: While the 19-day July heatwave stood 
out as the most striking weather event of the season, a Met Office 
report said it was 'more notable for its duration than the actual 
temperatures recorded'

Trying to keep cool: The Met Office has revealed
that between June 1 and August 28, the average temperature in the UK 
was 15.2C (59F) - just under the 15.78C (60F) figure recorded in 2006
