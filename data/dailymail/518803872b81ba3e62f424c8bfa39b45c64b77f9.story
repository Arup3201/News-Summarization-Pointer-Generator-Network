Wayne Rooney believes the best days of his career are still to come as the striker seeks to immortalise himself for both club and country.

The 28-year-old is within touching distance of the all-time goalscoring records for both Manchester United and England, and he believes the next two or three seasons will be a golden time for him. 

In an interview with the Sunday Times, Rooney said: 'I still believe I can get better as a footballer.

But Rooney's afternoon ended in ignominy after receiving a red card for kicking Stewart Downing

1. Bobby Charlton 249 goals (758 games)

2. Denis Law 237 (404)

3. Wayne Rooney 218 (443)

4. Jack Rowley 211 (424)

5. Dennis Viollet 179 (293)

= George Best 179 (470)

'In the next three to five years you will see me as a different player. The next two or three, I feel these could be the best years of my career.

'I'm at a stage, especially after playing at this club for 10 yeas, where I've picked up a lot about the game. I've learnt.

'I now know exactly what I want to do on the pitch and I'm fit and ready to do it.'

Rooney insists he has matured as both a man and a footballer, leading to his appointment as captain for both United and England this season, but he showed both sides of the coin in Saturday's match with West Ham.

After scoring a delightful goal to set United on their way to a 2-1 victory at Old Trafford, he let himself down with a petulant kick on Stewart Downing and earned a straight red card.

2. Gary Lineker 48 (80)

3. Jimmy Greaves 44 (57)

4. Wayne Rooney 41 (97)

5. Michael Owen 40 (89)

Rooney's goal against West Ham took him to 218 in a United shirt and he is in striking distance of Denis Law (237) and Bobby Charlton (249) at the top of the club's all-time list.

Rooney also needs another nine goals to overtake Charlton as England's all-time leading scorer and could well achieve it before the next European Championships.

But while it would be preferable to play in a forward position in order to chase down these records, Rooney acknowledges that his future may eventually lay in midfield.

He said: '[Louis van Gaal] goes into so much detail about the opposition and there'll be times I'll be needed to play deeper or wider, which I've no problem doing.

Rooney knows that United manager Louis van Gaal may want him to play in midfield in the future

'But in the main I feel I've still got at least two or three years up front. I know I've got the qualities to play in midfield. I've done it comfortably.

'There'll come a time when I move to a deeper position for good and that could be this week, it could be in a couple of years. It's down to the manager and I'll accept it.'

Sunday marks 10 years to the day since Rooney's spectacular debut for United, when the 18-year-old scored a hat-trick in a 6-2 Champions League win over Fenerbahce at Old Trafford.

In the intervening years, he has won six Premier League titles, three League Cups, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup.
