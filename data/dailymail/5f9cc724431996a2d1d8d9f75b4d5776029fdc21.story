If you thought cycling along the streets of London was dangerous, just have a look at some of these heart-stopping images from one of the most extreme cycling sports in the world.

In a unnerving mix of free climbing and BMXing, the Red Bull Rampage sees the best freestyle mountain bikers from around the globe go head-to-head in incredible death-defying stunts.

Set on the steep rocky slopes near Virgin, in Utah, America, these riders face crashing head first down the side of a huge precipice if they put just one foot wrong.

Not for the faint hearted: Riders, such as Andreu Lacondeguy pictured, attempt the risky flips and jumps for more points

The annual competition sees courageous riders make their way down jagged sandstone ridges attempting risky flips and jumps to gain points.

The dangerous competition is similar to freestyle snowboarding, where competitors determine their own route and are judged on their technical ability and choice of manoeuvre.

Canadian Kurt Sorge took first place at the extreme sporting event held from October 5-7.

He said: 'It all came together.  It was gnarly, but I was just glad I got it together for myself and for first place. It was actually one of the funest rides I’ve ever ridden in my life. I was just stoked to get it in the bag and just link it all up.'

The inaugural Red Bull Rampage was held in 2001 to test a range of mountain bike skills such as downhill, slope-style and dirt jumping.

It was cancelled from 2004-2007 when authorities became concerned at the increasing risk competitors were taking but returned for the 2008 season with some 'man-made enhancements' gracing the venue.

However, the goal was still the same, according to organisers, with the target for every competitor to: 'Become a bad-ass on two wheels.'
