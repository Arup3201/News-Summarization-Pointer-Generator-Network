It's always been the goal of humans to scale the highest mountains - but getting down the other side unfortunately doesn't do us any good.

Descending the rocky terrain on foot plays havoc with our joints, leading to stress and injury, and it sometimes just isn't worth the effort.

Rushing down effortlessly on a mountain bike or other mode of transport is undoubtedly an adrenaline-powered thrill - it's just a case of getting the kit up there.

But now, a Dutch company may have come up with the perfect solution.

New innovation: KOGA has invented an integrated rucksack and scooter to allow mountaineers to easily glide back down the hillside after climbing it

Compact: The Bergmonch folds away into a 9kg rucksack which can easily be carried on the back up any mountain

Fold away: The Bergmonch can be assembled from rucksack to scooter in two minutes

KOGA have invented the Bergmonch, an integrated rucksack and scooter, which allows you to easily glide downhill in either a standing or kneeling position.

The manufacturers say the upright riding position and different sized wheels ensure perfect handling and safety as you wind your way down.

And the scooter can then be re-packed in just two minutes into a 9kg rucksack which fits comfortably on your back.

The company are hoping to appeal to the increasingly young groups of climbers and hikers, saying they have a trendy mode of transport for wheeling downhill which is also unobtrusive when climbing uphill.

Quick way down: The scooter can be used in a kneeling or standing position on all kinds of terrain

They point to studies that show 67 per cent of all mountaineers suffer from knee and ankle problems because when walking downhill, our joints have to cope with several times the amount of our own weight.

The Bergmonch, which means 'Mountain Monk', can be used on mountain bike tracks and paths, as well as smoother roads. It is perfectly capable of covering large distances effortlessly, KOGA say.

Portable but pricey: The Bergmonch will set you back £1,200

In the long run, the makers hope their product will make Alpine tourism safer and more sustainable by reducing reliance on railways and toboggan runs to transport mountain bikes to the summits.

Saving your joints and muscles comes at a price though - the Bergmonch retails at around £1,200.
