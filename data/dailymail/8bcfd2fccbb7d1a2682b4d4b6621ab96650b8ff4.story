When Li Jiewen lost both his legs to polio as a child, he vowed to fulfill his dream of becoming a farmer nevertheless . . . and he hasn't put a foot wrong since.

The 46-year-old is now famous across China for his industrious approach to farming and overcoming what for most would be an incapacitating handicap.

Rather than give in to his disability, he built a host of contraptions that help him perform the tasks he must in order to keep his farm running.

Industrious: Passers by may see Li Jiewen paddling out to plant rice in waterlogged paddy fields on a truck tyre he converted into a raft

Mobile: He drives a three-wheeler moped with modified controls as he delivers his rice to local stores

Passers by may see him paddling out to plant rice in waterlogged paddy fields on a truck tyre he converted into a raft.

He milks cows by pushing himself along on a skateboard to reach their udders and sweeps floors with a cut-down broomstick.

From a poor family, and being disabled, he was unable to be educated beyond the age of 11. But Li worked hard floating around paddy fields on his tyre, saved his money, and eventually opened a general store in the village where he lives.

And when his story was told on Chinese TV recently, he became a celebrity.

Disadvantaged from birth: From a poor family, and being disabled, he was unable to be educated beyond the age of 11

Success story: But Li worked hard floating around paddy 
fields on his tyre, saved his money, and eventually opened a general 
store in the village where he lives

Determination: His uncomplaining attitude coupled with his determination to live as normal a life as possible has endeared him to the hearts of people in a land where the divide between haves and have-nots grows greater by the day

His relentlessly positive attitude coupled with his determination to live as normal a life as possible has endeared him to the hearts of people in a land where the divide between haves and have-nots grows greater by the day.

He married twenty years ago and his two daughters help out in the family store.

Around his village he is a friendly face that everyone recognises because he always wants to help out others, and asks nothing for himself.

He said:  'You can sit and moan that you have nothing, and how bad your lot in life is, or you can get on with it and carve out a life for yourself.

'I chose the latter.  

'Life is about choices. I made mine, and I have no regrets.'
