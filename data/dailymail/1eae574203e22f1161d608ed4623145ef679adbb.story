Each week Sportsmail gathers up the ratings from our team of reporters to provide the best Barclays Premier League starting XI of the day.

Saturday saw Manchester City keep up the pressure on league leaders Chelsea without a striker and also saw West Ham continue their fine start to the campaign thanks to fine performances by England's Stewart Downing and Andy Carroll.

However the star of the day was Queens Park Rangers striker Charlie Austin who scored a remarkable hat-trick to beat West Brom from 2-0 down. So, here is our team of the day.

GK - Adrian (West Ham vs Leicester) - 7.5

The Spanish keeper enabled West Ham to dominate the match and build from the back. The 27-year-old denied David Nugent and Leonardo Ulloa late on to maintain the clean sheet.

DEF - Nathaniel Clyne (Southampton vs Everton) - 8

Sam Cunningham at St Mary's 

The right-back continues to earn the plaudits with a man of the match performance as Ronald Koeman's side cruised past Everton. The England international was a constant threat on the right.

DEF - Ron Vlaar (Aston Villa vs Manchester United) - 7

Laurie Whitwell at Villa Park

Imperious at heart of Villa’s defence for the most part, physically dominating his Dutch colleague Robin Van Persie.

DEF - Aaron Cresswell (West Ham vs Leicester) - 7.5

25-year-old summer signing from Ipswich ran over six miles during a determined performance for the Hammers and looks to have made the step up to the Premier League with consummate ease.

MID - Erik Lamela (Tottenham vs Burnley) - 8

Matt Lawton at White Hart Lane

The Argentine fired in a spectacular 25-yard curling left-foot shot that was hit on the move and with more than enough pace to elude Tom Heaton to hand Spurs the three points with one of his finest games in a Tottenham shirt.

MID - Alex Song (West Ham vs Leicester) - 7.5

Song offered his own thoughtful, considered approach. He gives West Ham a dimension beyond the purely physical and contributed richly.

MID - Stewart Downing (West Ham vs Leicester) - 8

Much like Song, Downing was highly effective for West Ham and is clearly relishing his free role in the Hammers attack. Scored a fine second-half goal to secure the win.

MID - David Silva (Manchester City vs Crystal Palace) - 8

Adam Crafton at the Etihad Stadium

Stood up to be counted in the absence of City's usual marksmen. A wonderful footballer and after hitting his third and fourth goals of the season, he should be aiming for 10 from this campaign

FWD - Andy Carroll (West Ham vs Leicester) - 8.5

The striker fired in his third goal in three games and continues to make his mark since returning from a series of injury setbacks. His hold up play and threat in the air is providing West Ham with a fine alternative in attack.

A penalty, a poacher’s finish and an instinctive header hauled three points from what appeared a point of no return – QPR’s first Premier League hat-trick since Bradley Allen in November 1993, and what a time to get it
