Support for Andy Murray's mother, Judy, on Strictly Come Dancing could nose-dive following her son's intervention in the Scottish referendum, fans say.

The tennis star provoked anger by  backing independence in a message tweeted on the day of the historic vote on Britain's future.

His tweet was attacked by Scottish supporters of the union, who pointed out that the 27-year-old player lives in Surrey and did not have the right to vote.

It is thought anger with the former Wimbledon champion may now hit his mother's hopes of glory on BBC show Strictly Come Dancing.

Judy Murray was hoping to become a hit on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing when it starts later this month

But of her and partner Anton Du Beke's chances may be hit by her son, Andy's, referendum tweet yesterday

Judy, 55, is dancing with the show's Anton Du Beke and the pair are currently getting ready for the first programme on September 26.

It was thought Judy, who wore tartan trousers in some publicity photos ahead of the show, would play on her Scottish roots and dance to Mull of Kintyre.

But she may be forced to rethink her plans after the outrage directed at her son following his decision to make his political views public.

Fans of the show took to Twitter today to predict she would struggle against fellow competitors, who include popstar Pixie Lott, ex-rugby playerThom Evans and TV presenter Caroline Flack.

Graham Smith tweeted: 'Somehow I think, similar to the #YES vote in the #indyef, Judy Murray's vote won't hold up in Strictly on Saturday.'

And Ron Kane ‏added: 'So...The first act of an emboldened England will be to vote Judy Murray off Strictly then? #indyref'

Judy was assigned Mr Du Beke as a partner  earlier this month and the pair are preparing for the first dance

Other Twitter users jokingly suggested that Andy, who was disparaging about his mother's chances on the show, may have intervened to stop her embarrassing him.

Telling of the moment she told Andy she was going on the show, Judy revealed: 'Andy said: "Oh my God, you'll be absolutely terrible". And I think he probably will be right.'

On Twitter yesterday, show fan Mike Ruddick wrote: '@andy_murray We see your cunning plan in that Yes vote tweet. It was to make sure that [Judy] gets eliminated in the first round of #SCD'

Bookmakers currently have Judy at 20/1 to win the competition, well behind 10/3 favourite Pixie Lott. 

Andy had previously remained silent on the issue of independence but posted a message on Twitter just hours ahead of the polls opening yesterday.

Murray - who was not eligible to vote in the Scottish referendum - was seen playing at Wimbledon yesterday

He tweeted: 'Huge day for Scotland today! no campaign negativity last few days totally swayed my view on it. excited to see the outcome. lets do this!'

His comments were met with abuse on the social media site, some of which is being investigated by police.

Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said: 'People who put abuse such as this online should be utterly ashamed of themselves for making such vile, disgusting and distasteful comments.

'We are monitoring social media and where appropriate will take action against those involved.

'Social media is important for many people but it must be used responsibly. There is no place for personal abuse of any kind on it.'
