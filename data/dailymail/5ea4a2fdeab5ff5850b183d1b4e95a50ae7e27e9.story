A crocodile which has terrified residents in Gaza after escaping from a zoo two years ago has finally been captured.

After searching on the internet for advice, police and fishermen teamed up to trap the six-foot-long deadly reptile with shark nets on Tuesday. 

They sat in a boat in the sewage pit for eight hours a day, for two weeks, as they tried to apprehend their foe.

Caught at last: This crocodile has been at large for two years and was finally caught on Tuesday by fishermen and police

Boxed in: Known as 'Rock', the crocodile is said to have eaten animals belonging to locals

But eventually they resorted to draining the sewage out, leaving the crocodile with nowhere to run.

Locals revealed they had been scared to leave the house in the evenings for fear of encountering the creature which ate their goats and ducks.

The crocodile escaped from his zoo enclosure in 2010 and crawled half-a-mile to a large sewage pit in the northern Gaza Strip town of Umm al-Naser.

Lt Col Samih al-Sultan was in charge of hunting down the reptile. He said: 'He had a lot of spirit in him. He wanted to be free.'

Nicknamed 'Sakher' (Rock), for his resilience, strength and determination, the crocodile now lives with four other of its type in the zoo in nearby Beit Lahiya.

'We hope he lives a good life here with his wives,' said Al-Sultan, who said he grew to both like and respect the animal.

'He’s a beautiful troublemaker,' added police spokesman Ayman al-Batniji. 'We really sweated to take him alive.'

Feared and respected: The crocodile grew to be liked by many, even though it caused great worry to local people

Around two months ago wastewater workers discovered the animal in one of the sewage basins, having grown considerably since its escape.

'We were afraid he would eat us,' said farmer Hassan Mohammed of Umm al-Nasser.

Even the crocodile's arrival in Gaza was complicated according to zoo worker Emad al-Qanoua.

He said it had been drugged and brought into blockaded Gaza through a smuggling tunnel under the Egypt-Gaza border four years ago.
