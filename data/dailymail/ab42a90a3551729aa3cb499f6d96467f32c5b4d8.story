The outlook for Greece darkened yesterday as it plunged deeper into recession and eurozone leaders cancelled a meeting to discuss a crucial bailout.

New figures showed that economic output slumped by 7 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2011 – amid increasing fears that Greece will not deliver the £2.8billion cuts package it has pledged in return for another huge bailout.

Experts had expected a fall of only 5 per cent ahead of the latest round of deeply unpopular austerity measures.

Greece is now in its fifth year of 
recession and faces even deeper spending cuts in exchange for bailout 
funds from Europe and the Inter-national Monetary Fund.

‘We were expecting the recession to 
get worse but not at this pace,’ said Nikos Magginas, senior economist 
at National Bank of Greece.

Fears that Greece is heading for a 
chaotic default on its towering debts were fuelled after an emergency 
meeting of eurozone finance ministers planned for tonight was cancelled.

Jean-Claude Juncker, the Luxembourg 
Prime Minister who chairs the so-called eurogroup, said he was still 
waiting to receive assurances from Greek leaders over the £2.8billion 
package of cuts to wages, jobs and pensions.

Athens went up in flames on Sunday 
night as Greek MPs voted for the savage austerity bill to satisfy their 
international paymasters and secure a new £110billion bailout.

Mr Juncker said ‘further technical 
work’ was required between Greece and the troika of lenders – the 
European Union, the European Central Bank and the IMF – including 
details of another £270million of cuts.

‘Furthermore, I did not yet receive 
the required political assurances from the leaders of the Greek 
coalition parties on the implementation of the programme,’ he said.

Greek conservative party leader 
Antonis Samaras – a frontrunner to win elections in April – refused to 
sign a written pledge to implement painful spending cuts if he becomes 
prime minister.

Mr Samaras has suggested that he would
rather renegotiate the terms of the austerity package thrashed out on 
Sunday night – much to the irritation of European leaders.

‘So far Samaras has not given a letter of commitment and this is a problem,’ said a source close to the talks.

European aides also said that last 
night’s meeting of the ‘euro working group’ – senior officials from 
eurozone finance ministries – was disrupted by a widening split over 
whether Athens can be trusted with a second bailout.

It was hoped that the latest bailout 
package – which also includes banks and other private lenders writing 
off at least half of the debt – would save Greece from collapse. But 
European leaders are growing increasingly frustrated with Greece after a
string of broken promises raised fears that the country will not 
deliver its end of the bargain.

‘We are getting closer to default,’ said a senior eurozone official. ‘Germany, Finland and the Netherlands are losing patience.’

If Greece does not seal a deal for 
more bailout funds, it will run out of money next month when it needs to
repay £12billion of debt.

That would trigger a chaotic default on the debts and could see Greece expelled from the single currency.

Eurozone leaders will now hold a conference call tonight to discuss the Greek crisis before meeting on Monday.

Following the rioting in Greece on 
Sunday, the Athens Chamber of Commerce said yesterday that at least 150 
businesses were damaged in the mayhem.

‘Most will probably never open again,’
said spokesman Panaghiotis Kanellas. ‘Beyond the damage, worth tens of 
millions of euros, at least 500 jobs are now in question.’
