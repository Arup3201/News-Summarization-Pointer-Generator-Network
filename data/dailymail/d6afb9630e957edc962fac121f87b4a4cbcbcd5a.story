Ben Ridd, then 13, suffered catastrophic brain damage  in a 2005 boat race, but showed his fighting spirit when he carried the Olympic torch in 2012

A boy who nearly died after a powerboat crash was spied on for six years before the Royal Yachting Association agreed to pay him compensation, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Ben Ridd, then 13, suffered catastrophic brain damage when a rival boat – driven by an 11-year-old novice – ploughed into his craft at 30mph during a race. 

The impact ripped off Ben's helmet and fractured his skull, leaving him in a coma for three weeks.

An investigation into the race in 2005, which had been authorised by the Royal Yachting Association (RYA), found that warnings about the safety of the boat design had been ignored.

The RYA finally admitted liability after a legal battle lasting years and last week agreed to pay Ben, now 23, £5.5 million compensation.

The money will go into a trust to pay for his lifetime care.

During the case, it emerged that Ben had been secretly filmed by investigators who wanted to assess the extent of his disability.

The 20 hours of footage has now been seen by the Ridds and their solicitors. They say it shows investigators following Ben from his house, on his way to school and even on a coach trip to London to buy Christmas presents. The family says the videos show Ben from when he was about 15 until he was about 21.

Ben said: 'I couldn't believe it when I learned they'd been spying on me for years but I'm pleased it's all over. I just want to be normal.'

His mother Leanne added: 'If they had done the decent thing and paid up immediately, we would have been able to give Ben the very best care immediately and he might not be as disabled as he is now.'

The RYA – whose patron is the Queen – last night described the surveillance as 'standard practice'. A spokesman explained that the decisions about the handling of the claim were made by their insurers at the time, Navigators. 

He said: 'Between the reporting of the incident to Navigators in 2005 and their decision to admit liability on behalf of the RYA in October 2012, Navigators effectively excluded the RYA from all decision-making in relation to the conduct of the claim.'

Ben was injured in a K-200 class Junior Offshore National Championship race for under-16s off Portland, Dorset, in June, 2005.

The crash happened when he rounded the first buoy and came to a sudden stop, and a pursuing powerboat crashed into him. Ben was left in a coma. At one point, doctors feared he would die and asked his family to say their final goodbyes.

It took him six months to recover the power of speech and he was in hospital for a total of nine months.

He is partially paralysed down his left side, has slurred speech and suffers from acute memory loss. He will need full-time care for the rest of his life. He can walk only with a stick, for just minutes at a time.

The initial report by the Government's Marine Accident Investigation Branch in 2005 was so damning that the RYA cancelled head-to-head powerboat racing for children under 12s.

Investigators said: 'The RYA also paid little attention to a letter and enclosed safety assessment which were sent to the organisation in 2004 by the boat's original designer, in which he warned of the dangers associated with the sort of accident that occurred.'

Welcoming the settlement, Leanne added: 'This isn't a lottery win. We will need this money – and more – to make sure Ben is looked after for the rest of his life.'

Ben showed his fighting spirit when he was an Olympic torch bearer in 2012. He left home 18 months ago but cannot drive and is dependent on carers. He works part-time at a Salvation Army shop.

The future of the RYA, which made a £161,000 loss last year, is unclear. It faces a bill for legal costs that could run to millions.

RYA chief executive Sarah Treseder said: 'Lessons have been learned and safety improvements implemented. We extend our best wishes to Ben and his family.'

Navigators did not respond to a request for comment.
