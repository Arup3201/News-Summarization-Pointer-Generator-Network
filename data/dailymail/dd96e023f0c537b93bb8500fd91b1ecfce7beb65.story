Liverpool legend Phil Thompson couldn't hide his bitter disappointment watching his side crash out of the Champions League against Basle.

The former defender, who made 477 appearances in the club's golden era of the 1970s and 1980s, was analysing the game for Sky Sports.

With the Reds on the back foot for much of the 1-1 draw at Anfield, Thompson leapt out of his seat for Steven Gerrard's incredible free-kick in the 81st minute.

But the Sky Sports pundit later slumps in his chair in disappointment as Liverpool are knocked out

With the Liverpool skipper's strike into the top corner looking to have given his side a glimmer of hope, Thompson pumped his fist and shouted 'get in there!' repeatedly.

However, like all loyal fans, the former Anfield assistant boss was sent on an emotional rollercoaster for the game's closing stages.

With every chance his side had, Thompson shouted excitedly, before looking to the heavens in frustration.

When the final whistle eventually blew - confirming Brendan Rodgers' side's exit - Thompson winced and put his head in his hands.

Gerrard's equaliser was not enough to see Liverpool overcome Fabian Frei's superb opener for the Swiss visitors.

The result saw Basle through as Group B runners up behind a Real Madrid side who won all six games.

Liverpool finished in third, one point ahead of Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets, and will compete in the Europa League knockout stage.
