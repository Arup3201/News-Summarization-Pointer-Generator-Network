It’s taken four years and cost £341m ($575.67m), but today the luxurious five-star Peninsula Paris hotel opens its doors, promising prince-like treatment to well-heeled visitors to the French capital.

Located close to the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees, the hotel boasts a penthouse suite, complete with its own lavish rooftop garden, that will set guests back £20,000 ($35m) a night.

The hotel - located in a late 19th century classic Haussmanian building - has 200 rooms and 34 suites – with prices starting at £800 ($1,400) a night for the most basic. 

New opening: The Peninsula Paris hotel - aimed at attracting the super-rich - cost £341m ($575m) to refurbish

The space opened in 1908 as a hotel, and in 1937 became a government conference centre

Luxurious: The lobby of the hotel, which boasts 200 rooms, including 34 suites, which start at £800 a night

There is also a fleet of BMWs, Mini Coopers and two Rolls-Royces to take holidaymakers around the city. And there are 600 staff on hand, including masseuses and cigar connoisseurs, to cater to every whim of its guests.

Each of the rooms allows guests to make free phone calls anywhere in the world and is fitted with a printer, coffee machine, a nail polish-dryer and a tablet centralising all functions from dimming lights to ordering breakfast.

The hotel building, which dates to 1908, is steeped with history, having housed the Nazi military command when Paris was occupied in World War Two and hosted 1973 peace talks aimed at ending the Vietnam War.

The Paris location will be the luxury Hong Kong hotel group's first property in Europe

Fancy a dip? The underground, inside pool has a 'zen' design and features a floor-to-ceiling waterfall design

It is housed inside the old Hotel Majestic, which in its day hosted dinner parties with renowned guests such as Marcel Proust, Pablo Picasso and James Joyce.

In 1928, George Gershwin wrote, An American in Paris while staying at the hotel.

Today, it reopens as a luxurious hotel, boasting a rooftop terrace with 360-degree views over Paris, and restaurant, as well as an underground spa and swimming pool.

There’s also a Chinese restaurant – LiLi – serving Cantonese cuisine. 

In addition to this cafe, the hotel has 600 staff members to look after guests' every need 

Asian influence: It may be in Paris but the hotel has a Chinese restaurant called LiLi

The new opening is seen as part of a battle to attract Asia's new class of wealthy travellers that not only pits the world's top hotel groups against each other but also cities such as Paris, New York and London.

For the Peninsula team, it is a long-term investment, piggybacking on Paris's efforts to woo the Chinese in particular over the past decade.

And the extensive refurbishment is seen as a bid to stand out against other newcomers such as the Mandarin Oriental, the Shangri-La and the Royal Monceau operated by the Singapore hotel group Raffles which opened their doors in recent years.

Once the refurbished Ritz and Crillon hotels re-open next year, Paris will have increased by more than 50 per cent its number of five-star beds to more than 2,000 in little over a decade.

The hotel has five suites with private roof terraces - but even a regular room comes with a massive closet

The gold leaf design was painstakingly applied in the hotel - 20,000 pieces in total were used

A 75% size replica of the L'Oiseau Blanc biplane is on the terrace of the restaurant and bar LíOiseau Blanc located on the sixth floor of the hotel which has 360-degree views of Paris

The Peninsula has one year to lure a devoted clientele before the Ritz and Crillon each reopen after overhauls

Staff on demand: The new hotel has employed 600 employees for just 200 rooms

Will it do the trick? The French government hopes this new offering will lure more Chinese travellers
