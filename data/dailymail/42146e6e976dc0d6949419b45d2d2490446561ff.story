It's not uncommon to see a dog on the back of a flat-bed truck, perhaps at a stretch, even the odd pig - but a horse?

Police in the northern New Zealand town of Kaitaia are stunned by what they have seen - going as far as posting the comment 'speechless' on social media.

And animal welfare groups have also expressed their anger, amid claims it was no leisurely drive around the block. The ute is believed to have topped 100 kilometres an hour on a state highway.

No, this is not a horse float. Police in the northern New Zealand town of Kaitaia are stunned by what they have seen - going as far as posting the comment 'speechless' on social media after photos showed an untethered horse riding on the back of a table-top truck

Authorities are hoping their decision to post the image on Facebook, which shows the horse standing in the back, apparently without any sort of restraint, will lead to the identity of the owner.

It has also sparked much debate about road transport rules in parts of New Zealand.

Houhora constable Tracee Knowler told the Northern Advocate the horse had been spotted travelling around Northland on the back of the ute quite a few times recently, and in one case a motorist had reported it topping speeds of 100kph on a local highway.

Houhora Police confirming this in the statement: 'This vehicle had been seen at open road speed on State Highway One.' 

NZ Police say other motorists have reported seeing the table-top travel at speeds of 100kph on a highway with the untethered horse in the back

Some social media comments have taken a light-hearted look at the matter, referring to 'the tail-gate being open' or 'how much horse-power does that make it?' But most have taken a more serious tone, including local police.

TVNZ quoted Houhora Police as providing this statement: 'Looking at the horse it seems relaxed - I don't think anyone would deny that'.

'However, transporting a horse in that manner on that truck with no sides to speak of, on open and at the moment extremely busy roads is just crazy and dangerous to everybody using the road including the horse.

'There is nothing to stop that horse or part of it going over the side of the truck.

'So you can say it's quiet, trained etc. - but what if the driver has to slam on the brakes or gets hit by another vehicle?

'Or as someone has said it gets spooked by something like a fire truck and siren? I too have seen other horses transported on the backs of trucks - but never have I seen one on a truck without high sides.'
