From people chewing with their mouths open to those who crack their knuckles, we all have certain sounds that grate on our nerves.

But for one man, the sound of popping gum, cracking ice or the innocent flick of a lighter can trigger the most irrational anger.

Paul Tabachneck, 39, has misophonia, which literally means ‘hatred of sound,’ despite being a musician.

Paul Tabachneck, 39, has Misophonia, which literally means 'hatred of sound,' despite being a musician. He can't bear noises including popping bubblegum and crunching ice cubes and becomes tense and angry

The IT worker, who lives in New York City, cannot bear certain noises and immediately become tense and has violent thoughts upon hearing them.

People with misophonia typically have an aversion to quiet everyday noises such as sniffing, clicking and crunching – even breathing – and they react involuntarily.

Mr Tabachneck remembers the first time he realised that his reactions to annoying sounds were different from anyone else's.

Aged 14, he was watching a film on TV when he heard his father scraping the final dregs of ice cream out of a bowl.

He told MailOnline: ‘I spun around and asked - to my Dad's surprise - “Do I need to pause the tape?”’,' adding that was probably his mildest reaction.

‘It’s got worse and worse. I didn’t know how to explain what I was going through and it registered as pain.’

After it 
was apparent that he was acting abnormally, his parents took him to an
 audiologist who said  his hearing was normal.

Instead, his problem 
with certain noises was ‘all in the head’.

‘I was upset. It felt like my parents didn’t trust me,’ he said.

It was not until 2010 that he was eventually diagnosed him with misophonia.

He couldn't afford the experimental treatments available 'in wallet or spirit, but just knowing there was a name for it and that I wasn't some isolated freak case, helped immensely.'

To help other people understand Misophonia, Mr Tabachneck has written a song called Two People Made This Mess to express how sounds make him feel. He says that music and the guitar does not annoy him when he, or someone else is playing it, unless the instrument is out of tune

Having lived with the condition for around 25 years – many people first experience problems when they hit puberty – he now knows what the worst sound triggers are and methods to cope with them.

‘Gum popping, [his worst trigger] is huge,’ Mr Tabachneck said.

People scraping bowls and chewing with their mouths open are also intolerable - and he can’t bear to be next to them.

Mr Tabachneck said: ‘You see red. The pain I feel is part of the feeling when you’re being attacked. It feels like you’re under threat.

‘I used to hate it when people opened and shut Zippo lighters in bars - although that doesn’t happen as many bars have banned smoking – and popcorn is bad.’

‘I love movies but I have to sit at the back of the cinema away from the popcorn noise – and move if someone sits nearby.’

Gum chewing and people crunching on ice cubes are also big triggers for him.

Explaining how gum chewing makes him feel, Mr Tabachneck said: ‘As soon as someone opens a packet of gum, the anxiety ramps up.

'If someone’s chewing with their mouth closed, its fine. But if they chew loudly with their mouth open I don’t know what to do. And if they pop the gum, a conversation starts.

‘I visibly react – my body does a thing that they notice.

'Sometimes people take offence when I ask them to stop, and I tell them about my condition.  But if they don't understand and stop, then they're an ass and I move away.’

He sometimes feels incredibly angry and has come close to violence on one occasion, which prompted him to explore anger management techniques, which are common for people with misophonia to use.

Once, for example, a young co-worker deliberately crunched an ice cube in his ear - after  he asked them to stop chewing on it.

'I immediately sprung out of my seat and adopted an aggressive pose – despite being opposed to violence,' he said.

‘That was the closest I’ve been to violence,’ he admitted. ‘I had to think about my anger and how to tone it down’.

As well as controlling negative emotions, he has found other methods of coping with misophonia.

‘You learn to live with it - and you can get headphones that block sounds. Maybe you also have a few less friends as some people don’t understand,’ he said.

The condition has cost him some relationships, too. ‘Before my fiancé, I was with a woman I loved and I realised I couldn’t be a husband or father without finding a way to get rid of my hang-ups [about sounds she made]’.

Misophonia literally means 'hatred of sound' and can be a hypersensitivity to background noise that does not generally bother other people.

Different people have different triggers, which prompt a negative emotional response.

Triggers include: chewing, sucking, teeth grinding, soft breathing, raspy voices, yawning, clicking on keyboards, writing sounds, plastic wrappers, animal noises, TV and body noises.

Sufferers can experience acute annoyance, discomfort or even rage and panic when hearing a noise, while some become agitated, defensive or offensive.

Others with the condition stay away from other people and experience relationship difficulties to avoid a 'trigger'.

Sometimes the people who are closest to a sufferer are those who make the most unbearable sounds.

People with misophonia can feel guilty about their reactions, which can include rage.

His fiancé, Ana, a social worker, loves bubble gum but doesn’t pop it in Mr Tabachneck’s presence.

‘She’s very conscious of the triggers and goes to great pains to keep the house safe for me. She apologises when she makes a noise that’s a trigger. It takes a very understanding soul to cope,’ he said.

To help other people understand Misophonia, Mr Tabachneck has written a song called Misophoina as well as an album Two People Made This Mess to express how sounds make him feel.

‘I wrote it so that it might help my friends understand – and other Misophones and their families understand – and maybe to deal with it in a cathartic way.’

Interestingly, he explained that music and the guitar does not annoy him when he, or someone else is playing it, unless the instrument is out of tune.

‘But there’s a Bill Withers track where he cracks a tambourine very close to the microphone to deliberately ramp up the tension – and it works. I

'love that song but I have to turn that part down or skip it completely as it gets me into a very angry place,’ he said.
