A woman posted a video apology to Facebook as part of her sentence for harassing someone on social media.

Fox8 said that a judge determined Ohio woman Alexua Aikens, 21, 'had previously posted a 10-minute video cyberbullying another woman.'

Judge Pinkey Carr told the affiliate station 'And so I said [to Aikens] "If you would like to enter a plea, I said I'm going to tell you now. You're going to have some obligations, and one of them will be the same mechanism that you used to commit this crime - what I call cyberbulling, assault, menacing, threatening - you're gonna use that same mechanism to apologize."'

Aikens' taped Facebook apology, obtained by Fox8, said in part 'Now knowing that my actions were not an intelligent decision, I am truly sorry for my actions, and I have learned to make better decisions.

'I would also like to state that I learned from all mistakes, and I was very irresponsible.'

Aikens 'was also ordered to get her G.E.D. and to serve a year probation,' Fox 8 said.

Speaking about the sentence, Carr told the affiliate station, 'It's not only to protect the public, but then again I want to rehabilitate the offender and I want to send a clear message to other people, the conduct that she engaged in - I mean it was totally improper.

'You know, it's not something - no one wants to be bullied, let alone when it's a cyberbullying, a face-to-face.

'At the end of the day, every person on this Earth - I mean you have your right to live your life without being threatened or intimidated by somebody, even if it's through Facebook or YouTube.'
