A 19-year-old college student suspected of murdering his parents and attempting to shoot dead two of his younger siblings had planned the attack over a 'long period of time', prosecutors said Monday.

Ashton Sachs appeared in court for the first time to face charges of murder after his parents Andra, 54, and Bradford Sachs, 57, were found shot in their sleep at their 3.5million home in San Juan Capistrano, California.

Prosecutors allege that Sachs set out to kill everyone inside the 9,000-square-foot mansion, down to his 8-year-old adopted little brother.

Sachs is also facing two counts of attempted murder for shooting at his younger brother and sister, paralyzing the boy and missing the 17-year-old girl. Sachs has another teenage sister who was also uninjured in the attack.

'This was not something that happened at the spur of the moment or in the heat of passion,' prosecutor Ebrahim Baytieh said.

'This is a horrendous crime involving an adult man who decided to murder and kill the people who loved him the most, and the people who were supporting him,' Baytieh added.

At the time of the murders, Sachs had moved out of the family home to Seattle, Washington where he was attending school.

Sachs drove the 1,200 miles from his home in Seattle to Southern California and snuck into the family home sometime after midnight on February 9.

He first shot dead his parents while their were sleeping in their bed with a firearm he purchased himself.

From there, Sachs targeted his younger siblings. He shot and hit his 8-year-old brother and missed hitting his 17-year-old sister before fleeing the property and taking a flight back to Seattle.

Baytieh wouldn't elaborate on a motive for the crime, but did say money wasn't a factor - though his parents were quite wealthy.

'I don’t have any indication whatsoever that his parents were anything other than supporting parents who cared about their children, all of their children — who supported their children, all of their children,' Baytieh said.

Sachs wasn't arrested until March 6, since neither of his siblings could identify the shooter.

Authorities first investigated whether one of the Sachs' many business connections was responsible, since they found several people who 'did not like' the couple.

The investigation narrowed in on Ashton Sachs when he filed for guardianship of his younger siblings along with older brother Myles, who was away at school during the attack.

In court on Monday, the judge delayed Sachs' arraignment until April 4. Until then, he will be held without bond at the Central Men's Jail in Orange County.

If convicted, Sachs could face the death penalty.

The Sachs divorced nearly 15 years ago, but continued to live and raise their five children together, despite a separation marked with restraining orders and hostility.

Following their divorce, which had been characterized by Andra Sachs as a 'financial decision,' according to a friend, the couple adopted a boy and girl from Russia.

Neighbors were shocked by the brutal killings of the seemingly pleasant couple, but their business associates and customers described the Sachs as difficult to work with.

Legal proceedings and several complaints had allegedly been made about the couple, who ran businesses under several names.

In 2011, Ms Sachs appeared on a list of California's top tax evaders, allegedly owing $1.15million to the state.

The following year, her name had been removed from the list, and she told Patch at the time: 'The amount due is highly in dispute and contested.'

Consumer watchdog website Ripoff Report contained several allegations against the couple over disputed rental agreements and claims that they took advantage of Ms Sachs's dying mother.

In a post from July last year, an alleged former tenant claimed they were still waiting for the couple to pay a court order of $8,000 over a deposit dispute.
