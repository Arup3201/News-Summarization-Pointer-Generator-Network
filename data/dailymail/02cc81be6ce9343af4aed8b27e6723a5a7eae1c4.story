Policing minister Damian Green said officers should be more police and friendly to repair their reputation

Police officers should be more polite and friendly to repair their reputation following the Stephen Lawrence smears controversy, policing minister Damian Green said yesterday.

Mr Green said public faith in British policing had been ‘undermined’ by revelations that the police had spied on the Lawrence family after their son was murdered in 1993.

In a speech to the Reform think tank, he said officers should learn from the experience of last year’s London Olympics.

He said: ‘The public reaction to the 
friendliness and openness of police at the Olympic Games shows how 
important relationship-building can be.

‘A
more open, polite, thoughtful, modern and representative police force 
can renew its relationship with the British public for the benefit of us
all.

‘The Team GB example shows very clearly that it does not matter how good you are – you can always get better.’

The
revelation that an undercover officer was told to find information to 
smear the Lawrence family after their son’s murder is the latest in a 
series of scandals surrounding the ethics of undercover officers.

Their practices have been mired in 
controversy since allegations emerged that they had been using dead 
children’s identities and engaging in inappropriate sexual 
relationships.

An investigation into undercover policing by the Metropolitan Police, named Operation Herne, is currently under way.

And there are at least another seven investigations going on as a result of police failings, which have so far cost £23million.

The minister said public faith in British policing has been 'undermined' by revelations officers spied on the family of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence (pictured) after his death in 1993

Mr Green said yesterday: ‘I want and expect to see a technologically savvy, well-managed, self-confident, open, transparent and scrupulously honest police force.

‘The police have always made us proud. I want them to do so again.’

But Labour last night said Mr Green’s comments were ‘deeply patronising’.

Shadow policing minister David Hanson told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I am sure a police officer tackling a pub brawl on a Saturday night in the town centre will take the advice of their policing minister to heart.

‘Of course the police should be polite 
with the public but many will see Damian Green comments as deeply 
patronising as they have been doing it throughout their careers.

Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester, said officer morale is low after negative publicity

‘The police should always act appropriately and face the consequences if they don’t - should they be polite of course they should and they don’t need Damian Green to tell them that.’

Mr Green’s comments come after one of the country’s most senior police chiefs claimed morale among officers is being affected by a barage of negative publicity.

Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘They are affected by what feels like a constant stream of negative stories at the moment... the impact of all the negative publicity does affect the whole force.’

Sir Peter, who is also vice president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, added: ‘There are a lot of judgements by armchair generals and almost professors in hindsight, not taking into context the state of society and things officers were being asked to do at the time some of these events occurred.’
