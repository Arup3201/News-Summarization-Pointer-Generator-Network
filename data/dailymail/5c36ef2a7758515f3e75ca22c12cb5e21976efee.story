A blaze which ripped through a historic castle built by Henry VIII may have been started by fireworks at a wedding reception, firefighters said today.

The roof of the Ryde Castle Hotel in Ryde partially caved in after the fire gutted parts of the turreted mansion, built to help defend Britain against the Spanish Armada.

Around 50 firefighters battled the flames as they rose into the air above the 18-bedroom building's listed east wing on the Isle of Wight.

Hotel guests and staff escaped the burning building in a late night evacuation as the fire brigade battled through the night to tackle the blaze.

Firefighters desperately tried to save the hotel's historic roof where the fire was thought to have started but were unable to prevent it from collapsing.

A spokesman for the Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service said that the blaze could have been started when fireworks were let off to celebrate the wedding of Robert Ballard, 23, and wife Alex, 21.

Mr Ballard told The Sun: 'It was a complete disaster. It was meant to be a fairytale wedding but it was a disaster.'

She added that the building remained in a precarious condition today.

'We believe fireworks may have played a part, but it has not been confirmed,' she said.

'There were fireworks and there was a wedding party.

'The blaze started in the roof. There was structural collapse and concern with the structure of the building.

'All firefighting was carried out externally and external walls were uncertain.

'The listed side of the building, the east wing, was affected.'

Users took to a local community blog site to reveal how fireworks had been let off from the roof of the grand hotel on a number of occasions in the past.

Brear, a project manager at IBM, posted on social networking website 
Twitter: 'It's quite sad to see the hotel where Hannah and I had our 
wedding reception as a burnt out shell (Ryde Castle).'

'When I saw Ryde Castle it made me want to cry. Were (sic) are we gonna go to watch carnival. If it wasnt for that hotel i wouldnt even live here.'

Flames were seen pouring into the sky above the castle during the night and plumes of thick smoke which filled the air could be seen from miles around.

Some of the 60-strong wedding party left stranded by the blaze were given emergency accomodation by a local church keen to help.

Firefighters were forced into a frantic as the roof collapsed but amazingly no one was hurt.

The hotel's website describes it as 'originally a large and spacious Victorian family home, overlooking Ryde Esplanade and Harbour on the Isle of Wight with stunning views across the Solent.

'This majestic building which was to become the Ryde Castle Hotel is claimed to have been commissioned by Henry VIII to defend the Spithead, Southampton Water and the Solent from the invasion by the Spanish Armada during his daughter's reign.

'During World War I the building was used as a wartime hospital and during World War II it was an Army HQ.

'Rumours say there is a friendly spirit, although playful moving of objects and some sightings is all we can offer with any certainty.'
