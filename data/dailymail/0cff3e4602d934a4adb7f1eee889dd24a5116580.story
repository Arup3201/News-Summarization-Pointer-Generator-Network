A carer was caught on camera stealing money from a trusting dementia sufferer who hid hundreds of pounds around her home.

Janet Maddocks was caught red-handed after the victim's suspicious relatives filled her home with secret cameras.

They then watched 57-year-old Maddocks taking money from the 73-year-old woman's handbag in the kitchen, before combing through her bedroom the following day.

The family, who had streamed the camera footage to a laptop computer, then passed the CCTV tape to police.

Caught on film: Janet Maddocks was prosecuted after the victim's suspicious relatives filled her home with secret cameras, including here when she rifled through the victim's handbag

Last month Maddocks, who had been hired through a private agency, was sentenced to 10 months in prison after she admitted two counts of theft, owning up to taking £30 from her charge.

Callous: Maddocks would attend the woman's home to help with her meals and medication, but also searched her house for cash

The daughter of the victim, who has not been named, said that the family could not believe what they were seeing as they viewed the video footage.

'We were so angry that she was taking advantage of our mother. We felt completely numb by her actions, which have caused so much distress,' she told the Sunday Mirror.

Maddocks, of Marple, near Stockport, had been one of several carers who would attend the woman's home to help with her meals and medication.

The daughter said that the woman, who was often confused due to her dementia, would often leave money hidden around the house, drawing out £200 or £300 a week.

'But over a number of months we noticed that the money wasn’t in the usual places and one week there was only £8 left. I knew something was definitely wrong,' she said. 

The suspicious family then decided to install hidden cameras to pinpoint who had been taking the money, and a few weeks after setting up the CCTV network spotted Maddocks behaving suspiciously.

Watching on the laptop, they saw her rummaging through coats, bags and pillowcases - all spots where the woman would leave her money.

The daughter said Maddocks had appeared to be putting things into her pocket, although she initially did not believe that she was stealing due to Maddocks's role as a carer.

However, she said that in another clip she saw Maddocks put her hand into a handbag, take out some money and put it under her bra strap while the grandmother was out of the room.

Following her arrest, Maddocks initially denied stealing from her charge, but later admitted the thefts on October 8 and 9 last year when she was confronted with film evidence.

The daughter said that Maddocks had admitted taking £30, although they believed that a lot more money had vanished.

She added that she has not told her mother, but that she was aware that something was wrong.

Maddocks pleaded guilty to two counts of theft at Stockport Magistrates' Court in December, and was given two five-month sentences to run consecutively.

Detective Inspector Matt Hope, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This was a sickening abuse of trust and the actions of Maddocks have had a tremendous impact on the victim and her family.'
