It was a first-half of contrasts for Clint Dempsey in the USA’s opening game against Ghana – he brilliantly scored the World Cup’s fifth fastest goal of all-time, before sustaining a suspected broken nose from a flying boot.

The former Fulham and Tottenham forward found himself on his back after an ungainly aerial clash with John Boye ended with the Ghanaian’s boot finding the American’s nose.

Dempsey grabbed the fastest goal of the World Cup so far just 29 seconds into the Group G clash in Natal, with a crisp low finish into the bottom corner that he celebrated ecstatically.

After the game, Dempsey revealed that the challenge had broken his nose.

'I was having trouble breathing. I was coughing up blood,' he said. 'I think I broke my nose.'

The 31-year-old had to leave the pitch
 briefly in an attempt to stem the blood from his nose but soon returned
 – with a significantly enlarged hooter and tissue stuffed up his 
nostril.

Impressively, 
Dempsey’s super-fast opener didn’t even come from an American kick-off –
 after Ghana made a mess of their opening couple of passes, USA’s No 8 picked up the ball following a throw-in and was given a free run 
at the area.

Skipping past 
one challenge he darted into the box, opened up his body and 
impressively slotted his low left-footed shot past Adam Kwarasey and 
into the corner.

Dempsey’s 
goal was some way slower than Hakan Sukur’s 11-second effort against 
South Korea in 2002 but still marked the fastest World Cup goal in 12 
years.

The first minute strike remains the only goal of the game with USA leading Ghana 1-0 at half-time.
