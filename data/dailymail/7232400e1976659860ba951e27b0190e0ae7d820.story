A teacher has been arrested on suspicion of stashing child porn on his work-issued computers - seven years after the school reportedly branded one of his students a 'troublemaker' for telling them about graphic images.

Lawrence Hughes, 59, allegedly had more than 20 child porn pictures on two computers issued by Union Academy Magnet School in Polk County, Florida and was arrested last week.

Now the mother of one of his former 8th-grade students has claimed her son alerted the school to the images years ago, but said officials punished the boy and told her he was a troublemaker.

Caught: Middle school teacher Lawrence Hughes, 59, allegedly told police he had a pornography addiction

'My son just blurted out, "He has 
porn on his computer",' Joan Mac Hill told WTSP. 'I thought "well he's a kid; he'll do anything to get out of
not having to do his homework".'

But when the boy, John Mac Hill, insisted that he was telling the truth, she told the principal.

'He said my son was a troublemaker and there was no point of fact that there was porn on that teacher's computer,' she told the news channel.

When Hughes was arrested last week, she contacted school officials and police to complain.

The images surfaced after a student told detectives he had been using Hughes' computer when he saw a 'pop-up' warning reading: 'You have been viewing or distributing child pornography.'

Hughes, a research teacher and 
30-year veteran of the school district, promptly shut down the computer 
and did not say anything about the message, according to the police 
statement.

Authorities allegedly later found lewd pictures of prepubescent and pubescent boys between the ages of 12 and 16. Others showed images of children engaging in sexual acts with adults, and yet more showed nude boys engaged in sexual acts with each other, the police statement said.

The student also told investigators he had been invited by Hughes with some other male students on a canoe trip earlier in the year, but did not go.

He said he later saw photos of the two students, who were 13 or 14, and said Hughes 'wrestled' with one of the boys and held their hands while 'praying',Â ABC Action News reported.

Hughes was arrested in his front 
driveway as he headed for a vacation with his wife in the Carolinas; 
when officers approached him, he admitted he had a porn addiction,
the sheriff said.

'He said, "I'm addicted to pornography, but I don't download child pornography, but if it downloads I put it on a thumb drive and I take it to school and put it on the school's computers",' Polk Sheriff Grady  said.

Workplace: Hughes is a research teacher at Union Academy and has worked for the district for 30 years

Investigators are now asking students or parents who may know of inappropriate contact that Hughes may have had with children to contact them.

The Sheriff's Office said that for 22 years, Hughes has been part of a mentoring program where he took young boys camping.

'He didn't say how many years he'd been addicted to porn, but I am suspicious. We know it's not his first rodeo, so who's not been reporting him in the past?' Judd asked.

Mac Hill added: 'He had no right to expose those children to that. He had no right to bring his personal things into that classroom.'

10 News contacted the school district, who said they could not comment on any previous complaints because of their on-going investigation.
