Manchester City are set to take on Liverpool on Monday night in the first super heavyweight clash of the new Premier League season.

The two sides filled the top two spots at the end of last season, and after two epic ties between the sides, more fireworks will be expected at the Etihad Stadium. 

Here, Martin Keown runs the rule over the key factors that could determine the result of the game.

Manuel’s men in the middle

Fernandinho and Yaya Toure were so strong as a midfield two last season that they allowed City to play two strikers. With Fernando now at the club, they have more options.

He is more mobile than Javi Garcia, so Manuel Pellegrini can use him and Fernandinho to fight Liverpool’s strength in the middle.

With the Brazilian boys sweeping up trouble, that leaves Toure to go and do some damage further up the pitch. But with City’s wide men joining the party, expect the midfield to get congested.

Strength: Yaya Toure was vital to Manchester City's title charge last season

Addition: Whilst new arrival Fernando should add more defensive resolve to their engine room this time out

Brace yourself for a fast start. City scored 17 goals in the first 15 minutes of matches last season. Only Liverpool came close to matching them with 15 goals.

Midfield balancing act

Without Luis Suarez, it is going to be interesting to see how Liverpool adapt.

Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge were the standout players last weekend, but Philippe Coutinho has a key role to play this season.

The Brazilian was excellent in the second half of last season and a surprise omission for the World Cup, though his country has seen sense and picked him for their latest squad.

His trickery can trouble City, though that could require Lucas or Joe Allen to sit deep. They are naturally more inclined to defend, though Allen is better at moving the ball on quickly. His quality on the ball could be key in a fiery game.

Standout: Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge starred for Liverpool last Sunday

Key role: But Philippe Coutinho's creativity could be key to Liverpool's chances this campaign

City more settled with one up top

Pellegrini went with two strikers for most of last season, but City played a lone striker home and away against two teams — Liverpool and Barcelona.

Pellegrini respected Liverpool’s attacking style and I expect more of the same tonight. With Alvaro Negredo out and Sergio Aguero slowly coming back, Edin Dzeko offers the best balance in attack as a lone target man.

Hold-up role: Edin Dzeko could offer Manchester City balance as a lone targetman

Preference: Although Manuel Pellegrini tends to favour playing two strikers in his team

Good memories

Brendan Rodgers will want to draw on last season’s matches against City.

Liverpool gave them a scare in a 2-1 defeat at the Etihad and dented their title hopes in their epic 3-2 win at Anfield, only for City to recover.

Both times City were tested to the limit and Pellegrini’s side will take nothing for granted.

Balotelli’s a bonus

There is a lot of negativity around Mario Balotelli, but his arrival can energise Liverpool.

You won’t have heard many names mentioned more often in press conferences than Luis Suarez and Mario Balotelli, but Rodgers managed Suarez well and he can do it with Mario. He is a signing to get the fans out of their seats.

Impact: Mario Balotelli's arrival on Merseyside could energise Liverpool this season
