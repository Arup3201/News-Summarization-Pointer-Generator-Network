Tinder would normally be the place to find a quick date or in some cases love, but for this Australian it's become a form of inspiration.

Jarrod Allen, from Sydney, finds potential matches on the dating app and then painstakingly recreates their weird and wonderful profile pictures.

The hilarious results end up on the 25-year-old's blog and Instagram where he goes by the name Tindafella.

'I've got a phone full of stupid (profile) photos. There's stacks out there,' Mr Allen told Daily Mail Australia.

'Everyone thinks they take ages to recreate, but it's actually really quick. I see a photo and if I think I can recreate it myself, I go ahead.'

He recreates photos of girls posing with pieces of fruit, surfboards and musical instruments.

It all started three months ago when he found a girl's profile who had 'really dark, thick eyebrows', so he whacked on some duct tape and it was an instant hit

Mr Allen's absolute favourite is a shot of a bikini-clad girl having water poured on her, which he turned around and recreated with milk

The 25-year-old says he has a phone full of ridiculous Tinder profile photos

His photos and blog have become a phenomenon of late and he soared to more than 60,000 Instagram followers in two weeks

But Mr Allen's absolute favourite is a shot of a bikini-clad girl having water poured on her.

'That took the longest to recreate. We actually went to the shops and bought six litres of milk, then I sat on a rock and a mate poured it over me.'

His photos and blog have become a phenomenon of late and he basically reached 29,000 Instagram followers overnight.

Mr Allen insists his blog is just a bit of fun and says he's only been asked by one girl to remove the photo

He says he doesn't care if the women see the mock photos, but those who have come across the photos have laughed

He said everyone often thinks the photos take ages to recreate, but Mr Allen says they're actually pretty quick

It all started three months ago when he found a girl's profile who had 'really dark, thick eyebrows'.Â 

'I was sitting in my mate's work truck and I started flicking through Tinder and I saw that photo,' he said.

'I had duct tape in my pocket because I'm an electrician so I whacked it on and sent it around to a couple of the boys.

'It got a pretty good reaction so I kept doing it.'

This sword shot was the most recent Tinder photo Mr Allen recreated

Mr Allen says the international reaction to his block and widespread media attention was unbelievable

Mr Allen insists his blog is just a bit of fun and says he's only been asked by one girl to remove the photo.

'I don't care if they've seen them but a few of them have and have laughed. I (recreated) a photo of Tully from Big Brother and I ran into her at Splendour in the Grass and she was pretty stoked.'

Mr Allen is an ambassador for the charity Beard Season, which encourages people to get their skin checked.

'Tinder's probably not the best place to look for something serious. I mean, it does happen, but it's rare,' he said
