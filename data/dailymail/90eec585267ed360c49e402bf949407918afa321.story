Hundreds of Polish residents took to the streets to give a hero's welcome to a convoy of U.S. troops who are driving through eastern Europe and deliver a damning message to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Children climbed on to Stryker armoured vehicles and even offered souvenirs to the troops, who stopped to pose for pictures in the main square of the eastern Polish town of Bialystok.

Meanwhile other residents lined the roads and applauded as the troops from the 3rd Squadron of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment of the American Army passed by.

The scenes mirrored those in France after Paris was liberated at the end of the Second World War when crowds of French citizens lined the streets to greet the American soldiers after German troops were forced from the region.  

The soldiers have recently been taking part in the Atlantic Resolve exercise, which was intended to demonstrate NATO's readiness to defend its members.

Poland borders Ukraine and Russia and the conflict between the two countries has caused anxiety there.

Putin, in particular, is seen as the main driving force behind the war, allegedly sending Russian troops to support the rebels in the east who want independence from the Ukrainian government.

In just a year, it has cost more than 5,600 lives - and Russia's neighbours have become increasingly concerned Putin will turn his attention to them next.

Lithuania, for example, feels the threat from Moscow feels is so real the government plans to reintroduce military conscription.

But so far, America and the rest of Europe have refused to show any sort of military might towards the former Soviet Union - while Putin has made sure the rest of the world is in no doubt of the strength of his armed forces.

Just this week, Putin boasted of a massive military exercise across his country, involving 80,000 troops, about 100 navy ships and more than 220 aircraft, marking the beginning of a series of such drills this year. 

Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to Putin Tuesday that the manoeuvres were aimed at checking the readiness of the newly formed group of forces in the Arctic, as well as the military's capability to quickly field troops to several theatres of operations.

The convoy of American vehicles began their trip from Estonia last week and are travelling through Eastern Europe on their way to Germany 

Zdzislaw Narel, 60, said it was a historic moment to see the U.S. forces parade through Bialystok. 

He said: 'This really means a lot to us. We see that we are not alone, that there is someone to defend us.'

Meanwhile a U.S. soldier was heard saying from atop of a Stryker that they felt like movie stars.

The Dragoon Ride convoy of vehicles began travelling though Europe last week from Estonia.

Poland is also beefing up its own defences through exercises with NATO troops and through training its own reservists

They have passed through Latvia and Lithuania before entering Poland, on a 1,700 kilometre journey to a base at Vilseck in Germany.

It comes as Poland is also beefing up its own defences through exercises with NATO troops and through training its own reservists.

As part of a mobilisation exercise, hundreds of reservists summoned on a few hours' notice reported to a military base in Tarnowskie Gory in southern Poland.
