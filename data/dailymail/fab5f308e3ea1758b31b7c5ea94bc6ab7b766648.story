A Chilean artist has been found dead on the famous Brazilian staircase he spent his working life transforming.

Jorge Selaron's body was discovered on the 215-step staircase in the bohemian neighbourhood of Lapa in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.

Police refused to disclose the cause of death but have not ruled out murder and are investigating reports he had received death threats.

Visitors look on as Jorge Selaron's body lies on the staircase he spent his life decorating and which became known as 'Selaron Stairs'

The artist, 65, was said to have become depressed in recent months after receiving threats, which he claimed had come from someone who had worked in his workshop.

Neighbours, tourists and well-wishers braved heavy rain to pay tribute to Selaron, who turned the staircase leading up to St Teresa Convent from a dank and dreary scene to a multi-coloured 'tribute to the Brazilian people'.

His body was discovered in front his house, which faces the staircase.

The steps had become known as Escadaria Selaron (Selaron Stairs) since he started work on the project in 1990.

Friends and collaborators from around the world sent or took tiles to contribute to the steps' facade after he began tiling them and collecting old porcelain bathtubs to use as planters along the sides.

The artist was a well-known figure in Rio, with his sweeping handlebar 
moustache and friendly demeanour.

The candy-coloured steps became a city landmark in 2005 and the artist was declared an honorary Carioca, or Rio resident.

'We
 can speak of Lapa before and after Selaron. He changed the face of Rio.
 His death is something brutish, that makes no sense,' said Jocimar 
Batista de Jesus, aka Mestre Duda Pirata, a capoeira master who also 
lives along the steps.

'He had no resources, no support from the city,' he added.

'The neighbours helped as they could. I brought him tiles from my trips, from Spain, Holland, as I travelled. As it grew, people began to contribute, to send him tiles, to bring them to Rio when they came to visit.'

The hundreds of tiles depict subjects ranging from a woman in traditional Portugese dress, a seated Buddha, Indian deities, Bob Marley, antique French tiles and others with Arabic calligraphy.

Tour guide  Alejandro Martin Barreira said: 'Here in Lapa everyone knew him; he was the face of this bohemian, artistic neighbourhood.

'He was a simple man, who loved this life, sitting here, watching the kids play, chatting people up.'

Selaron wanted his staircase to last a lifetime.

'I will only end this mad and singular dream on the last day of my life,' he wrote on the wall nearby.

Several steps above, an anonymous contributor answered written on a plain tile painted in the green and yellow of the Brazilian flag: 'Obrigado, Selaron.'

'Thank you, Selaron.'
