Tony Hogue, sene here in an undated modeling photo, has come forward to tell the story of how he once banged down Bill Cosby's door after receiving a phone call from his friend who believed she was drugged and trapped inside the comedian's home in 1984

A former male model has become the first man to come forward with a story that corroborates a Cosby accuser's claims about the actor's alleged abuse.

Tony Hogue, now 58, worked as a model in a 1980s -- for the same agency that represented Cosby accuser Beth Ferrier -- and says he spent two drunken evenings at Cosby's Manhattan brownstone in 1984 along with Ferrier and another model friend.

After he declined a third debaucherous dinner at Cosby's home and his fellow models attended without him, Hogue says he got an unsettling phone call from his unnamed friend from inside the house after she believes she was drugged by the comedian. 

That friend would go on to become a witness called Jane Doe 8 in Andrea Constand's 2005 sexual assault lawsuit against Cosby, which never went to trial.

She, along with Hogue, separately recounted their stories from 1984 to the Daily Beast.

'She was crying. She was hysterical. She was whispering,' Hogue recalled to the Daily Beast. 'She said, "Tony, you've got to come get me."' 

Hogue told the site he had been working for the modeling agency JF Images, an agency with reported ties to Cosby, when he was flown to New York City for work.

He said he and his fellow models were invited to dine with the actor at his Upper East Side brownstone on tony 61st street twice.

'Why would Bill Cosby care less about these young girls coming from these modeling agencies? That was how he was casting extras on his show?

'That right there seemed ridiculous. I’d been to LA, and no actors I knew were doing that kind of stuff,' Hogue remembers wondering.

Scene: Hogue says his unnamed friend, who worked with him at JF Images--a  modeling agency with purported ties to Cosby--called him in a daze from inside Cosby's Manhattan brownstone (pictured) in 1984 

Cosby was at the cusp of breaking out as America's most beloved TV dad in 1984 when Hogue says he and his model agency friends were invited to his New York City home several time. Hogue says the night his friends went without him is when things took a turn

After an uncomfortable experience in which he claims Cosby first tried setting him up with a married female pilot--and another when he says Cosby very pointedly made clear he was his home's Alpha Dog--Hogue chose to turn down a third invitation to dine with Cosby.

While Hogue stayed in at the JF Images apartment some twenty blocks away, his friend and Beth Ferrier again went to Cosby's.

The friend recalled her night at the brownstone to the Daily Beast. 

'Perrier Jouet was served like water,' said the woman, who's now 53 and a successful business owner in Colorado.

'We were all young—in our twenties—and felt honored to be having dinner with Cosby,' she said, but then she said he tried to kiss her and things took a turn.

'I called Tony to come get me,' she said. 'This was after Cosby tried to kiss me. I was amazed, and quite disgusted (since he was close to my Dad’s age and smelled like a cigar). 

'I do recall that I felt out of control.'

Concerned both about how strung out his friend seemed on the phone and with what would become of him, a nobody, if he came barging into a superstar's home, Hogue told the Daily Beast he knew he had to help his friend.

Another model: Former model Beth Ferrier (right and left) also worked for JF Images and years ago admitted she had an affair with Cosby after meeting him with Hogue and his friend after they were invited to Cosby's home for a night of dinner and boozing. She's also accused Cosby of drugging and assaulting her

Both Ferrier and Hogue's friend were named as Jane Doe witnesses in Andrea Constand's (pictured) case against Cosby, but never testified

'I just started kicking [the door] and pounding it,' Hogue recalled. 'I made quite a racket. I wanted to get in.'

When Cosby finally answered, Hogue said he seemed unfazed by his apparent intrusion and merely asked what the problem was.

'There’s a big problem here,' Hogue said. 'Those girls are going with me right now!'

He claims went into the house and eventually found his friend clothed but disheveled and practically incoherent.

'After Tony collected me,' the friend told the Daily Beast, 'I was virtually incoherent. At the time, I was in a long-term relationship, but remember (with shame) that I called out for Tony after returning to the company apartment. To this day, I am still embarrassed by my behavior.'

Hogue said he never saw Ferrier at the home and they left without her that night. 

Ferrier has since gone public about what she called her brief affair with Cosby when she was a model in 1984. She said that he once drugged her coffee during an encounter in Denver and that she woke up hours later in the backseat of her car with her clothes disheveled.

Ferrier would also go on to become Jane Doe 5 in Andrea Constand's case.

Cosby in recent weeks has been accused of drugging and sexually assaulting more than a dozen women over many years.

Cosby has strongly denied wrongdoing and has never been criminally charged. A suburban Philadelphia prosecutor declined to press charges in Constand's case.

Cosby testified in Constand's case that he gave the National Enquirer an exclusive interview about the suit in exchange for the tabloid spiking a story about Beth Ferrier.
