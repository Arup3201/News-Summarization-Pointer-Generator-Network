A British man has been shot dead in Pakistan after bravely returning  to testify against a gang who allegedly kidnapped him.

Father-of-four Malik Iqbal from Bradford knew he was in danger but was determined to seek justice. He was assassinated by masked gunmen in front of relatives at a house in the city of Rawalpindi.

Mr Iqbal’s MP, David Ward, who yesterday visited his grieving widow Rukhasana and their four school-age daughters, said the family wanted the world to know the dangers that British Pakistanis faced when visiting the country.

‘They want the clear message to go out
that this is a very dangerous place,’ he said. ‘The fact that you are 
British is irrelevant as far as kidnappers are concerned.

‘Malik’s family is obviously distraught and their priority is to get his body back to Britain.

‘After that they want to see these bastards caught and brought to justice.’

Lib Dem Mr Ward said he met Mr Iqbal following the 2011 kidnap.

He said: ‘He was in a dreadful state and could hardly get up my office stairs because his legs were still injured from being chained to a bed.

Since then he has gone back to Pakistan three times to assist with court proceedings.

‘Most people would not have done that. He knew his life was at risk but he was an extremely brave man.’

A friend of the murdered man today said the killing raised questions about the protection provided for the 55-year-old by Pakistani authorities, and claimed the attack was 'something Mr Iqbal was afraid of'.

Riaz Ahmed, a former Bradford City Councillor, said: 'Everyone is shell-shocked by it. It was something Mr Iqbal was afraid of and I think the authorities in Pakistan have let down everybody.

'There should have been some kind of security for him.'

Mr Iqbal was kept blindfolded and chained to a bed during his 20-day kidnapping ordeal in 2011, and survived solely on occasional tea and biscuits.

Mr Ahmed said his 'determined and brave' friend had been adamant about giving evidence against his alleged kidnappers.

'He was very, very determined to go through with this,' he said.

'It was very important to him that this would not happen to anyone else. It is testament to his courage.'

Mr Ahmed said his friend's death was terrible for Mr Iqbal's widow, Rukhasana, and their four daughters.

He said Mr Iqbal had flown back to Pakistan in August, but said he was not sure what stage the kidnapping trial had reached.
