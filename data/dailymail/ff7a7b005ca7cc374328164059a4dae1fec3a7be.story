A teen military recruit was shot and killed by her recruiter after she rushed to help him when he threatened to commit suicide, it has been revealed.

Police say that Staff Sgt Adam Arndt,
31, shot himself at his Germantown, Maryland, home on Monday morning, 
but not before he gunned high school student Michelle Miller, 17.

Miller's father, Kevin Miller, told 
The Associated Press that he had never met Arndt, but that 
his daughter had seemed 'a little smitten with this guy.'

Tragedy: Michelle Miller was shot dead by her recruiter, Staff Sgt Adam Arndt, after she rushed to be with him because he had threatened to kill himself

He said that his daughter left their home on Sunday night, telling her parents that she had to help 'a friend' in her platoon who was suicidal.

Mr Miller exchanged several texts with his daughter after she left, but she wouldn't say where she was. He said she later stopped responding to his calls and text messages.

But she did send texts to her friends - messages like 'I love you' and 'goodbye.'

Fighting tears, Mr Miller told ABCNews.com: 'He shot her. She went to help him and he shot her for it.'

Miss Miller was a senior at Rockville 
High School, where she took advanced classes and played soccer and 
lacrosse. She was heading to Arizona State University in the fall.

Her father told ABC: 'She had a lot of 
things going on. She was all set to go to boot camp in June, go to 
initial training and then in January go to Arizona, but it's all over.'

Scene of the crime: The bodies of Miller and Ardnt were found inside his Germantown, Maryland, home on Monday morning

Arndt was a nine-year veteran who had served overseas, the Army said on Tuesday.

Miss Miller met him about four or five months ago as he signed her up to enter the Army Reserves, which she had joined to earn money for college.

Kevin Miller said his daughter left their Rockville home on Sunday night, saying somebody in her platoon was suicidal. He said she stopped responding to his calls and text messages.

Army recruiters are barred from 
fraternizing with recruits, a restriction that includes dating, inviting
recruits to their homes or having any kind of personal relationship 
that would place undue influence on a recruit, said Kathleen Welker, a 
spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Recruiting Command.

Arndt, a native of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, joined the Army in October 2003.

He was deployed to Turkey from September 2009 to September 2010, and his decorations include a medal for service in the global war on terrorism.

He has also served in Korea and Germany, according to personnel records released by the Army.

He was working as a human resources specialist before he was detailed in January 2011 to the recruiting office in Columbia, Maryland, Welker said.

Such assignments typically last three years, after which soldiers can decide whether to become permanent recruiters or return to their previous occupations.

His duties would have included visiting schools, Welker said, although it was not clear on Tuesday whether he had visited Miss Miller's school prior to recruiting her.

The investigation remains active and is focused on 'determining how these two people died,' said Capt. Paul Starks, a Montgomery County police spokesman.

Dana Tofig, a county schools spokesman, said military recruiters routinely visit the county's schools.

The school system's focus, he said, was helping those who knew Miller. Grief counselors were visiting her classmates on Tuesday.

Kevin Miller said his daughter was excited to join the military.

He said: 'She had her life taken away from her on one fell swoop.'
