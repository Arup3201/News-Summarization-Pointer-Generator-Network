A Utah high school teacher charged with raping her 16-year-old student pleaded not guilty Thursday to three counts of first degree sexual assault.

Brianne Altice, 34, was an English teacher at Davis High School in deeply Mormon Kaysville, Utah when she was arrested in October for the alleged sexual relationship, which reportedly began in a church parking lot and included at least three sexual encounters.

The 16-year-old boy admitted to investigators in November that he had had sex with Altice on three occasions in 2013 and testified to that fact at a preliminary hearing February 19.

In her arraignment Thursday, Judge Thomas L. Kay also scheduled a jury trial for May 12.

The blonde former teacher appeared collected in the Utah courtroom and chose to wear a close-fitting top, slim pants and conspicuously high heels.

According to the Standard-Examiner the teen said in the preliminary hearing that he was upset because his family had moved to Utah from another state.

He said he was having problems and home and doing drugs and that he would skip class to hang out with Altice.

Altice was originally arrested in October. Altice was believed to have had sex with a 16-year-old on many occasions, including at her South Weber home and at a park in addition to the church parking lot, a Davis County Jail report states.

Police have said there may be other potential victims.

Altice was only hired by the high school last August, but had previously worked for other schools in the district since 2004.

‘Anytime
 a story surfaces like this ... I think it all causes us concern because
 these are members of the community that are held to a higher standard,’
 district spokesman Chris Williams told Deseret News.

Altice is the fourth Utah teacher currently facing charges of sexually abusing children.
