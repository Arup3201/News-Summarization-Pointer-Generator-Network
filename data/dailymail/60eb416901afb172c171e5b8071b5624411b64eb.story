A bi-partisan congressional group has called on President Barack Obama to publish 28 pages of dossier which they claim proves a financial link between Saudi Arabia and the 9/11 attackers.

The report, which was produced by a joint congressional inquiry into the 9/11 attacks was heavily redacted by the then president George W Bush. 

The Joint Inquiry Into Intelligence Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 2001 was published in December 2002. 

Former Senator Bob Graham, pictured, who co-wrote a report on the 9/11 attacks has called on President Barack Obama to publish the final 28 pages of the 828-page dossier relating to the financing of the atrocity

The classified 28 pages are believed to outline how the 9/11 terrorists were financed by Saudi Arabia

However, 28 pages of the report were blacked-out in a bid to protect the United State's relationship with Saudi Arabia. The pages formed part of a wider 828-page dossier on the atrocity. 

Former Senator Bob Graham, who co-chaired the probe and helped write the report told ABC News: 'The 28 pages primarily relate to who financed 9/11 and they point a very strong finger at Saudi Arabia as being the principal financier.

'The position of the United States government has been to protect Saudi Arabia.

'At virtually every step of the judicial process, when the United States government was called upon to take a position, it has been a position adverse to the interests of United States citizens seeking justice and protective of the government which, in my judgement, was the most responsible for that network of support.'

The former Democratic senator has joined with Republican Walter Jones and Democrat Stephen Lynch as part of his campaign along with families of the victims. 

Senators Jones and Lynch have introduced legislation to force President Obama to publish the 28 pages.

If evidence proving a firm link between Saudi Arabia and the attackers, who were led by Egyptian-born Mohamad Atta, it would be possible for families of victims to sue the oil-rich Kingdom through the U.S. courts.
