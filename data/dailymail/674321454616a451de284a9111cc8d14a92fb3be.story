Sen. Rand Paul and Gov. Chris Christie placed first and second in a straw poll held during this weekend's Northeast Republican Leadership Conference, but Dr. Ben Carson may have stolen the show without being a candidate for anything.

He emerged in third place with 11 per cent support, tied with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Sen. Rick Santorum.

Paul led them by less than four points, with 14.7 per cent support. Christie polled 13 per cent.

A 'draft committee' intent on sparking Carson to run for the White House in 2016 raised more than $2.8 million in its first six months of existence.

That's more than double what the 'Ready For Hillary' group raised in its initial half-year, even though Hillary Clinton's candidacy seems far more assured than Carson's.

Dr. Ben Carson, professor emeritus at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, has become a quiet force in the 2016 Republican presidential race without announcing a thing

The group angling to persuade Carson to make a White House run brought activists to support him at CPAC, near D.C., in large numbers, but fared even better in a smaller New Hampshire setting without the extra muscle

Why they fight: New England Republicans mocked their favorite Democratic villains during the two-day conference in Nashua, N.H.

The top two poll slots at the smallish event that concluded Saturday in Nashua, N.H. mirrored those of a statewide Suffolk University/Boston Herald poll released on March 6.

Christie and Paul were tied with 12 per cent support each in that earlier poll, a tiny level of backing that shows how wide open the 2016 GOP presidential nomination race is. The top vote-getter, in reality, was 'undecided.'

Clinton, by contrast, typically dominates the Democrats' prospective 2016 field, leading all comers by 40 points or more.

Carson was not included on the Suffolk pollsters' list.

He polled 9 per cent – good enough for another third-place finish – in a straw poll at this month's Conservative Political Action Conference. But Paul dominated and won for the second straight year, with a 31 per cent showing.

CPAC is a a much larger gathering dominated by insurgent tea party-aligned activists, which included remarks from Carson.

But unlike the hyper-conservative event, which banned Chris Christie last year over his embrace of Barack Obama following super storm Sandy, just 29 per cent of the Nashua event's attendees said they identified with the 5-year-old right-wing tea party movement.

Polling few enough votes to be lumped into the catch-all 'other' category was MSNBC morning show host and former congressman Joe Scarborough, whose presidential trial balloons have largely popped amid Republicans' concerns about his 2012 change of heart on gun control.

Scarborough spoke Saturday morning and had little to show for it but a few book sales.

Carson made big waves despite being nearly a continent away in Montana, speaking to a crowd of 1,300 at the Flathead County Fairgrounds in an event hosted by a Christian school.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (L) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) placed #1 and #2 in the Northeast Republican Leadershpi Council straw poll, with a trip including Ben Carson nipping at their heels

The results: Rand Paul and Christie on top, Ben Carson in a surprising tie for third, and Joe Scarborough nowhere to be found

Red meat: Confernce attendees in New Hampshire were treated to a seemingly endless supply of political fire-stoking materials and anti-Obama one-liners

'I think the biggest issue facing us today is we've abandoned God,' he said there Friday night.

'I think the second biggest problem is we've become selfish. Nobody got that upset about [Operation] Fast and Furious. Nobody got that upset about Benghazi, NSA, IRS,' he went on, rattling off a series of President Barack Obama's most confidence-rattling scandals.

'But they got upset about Obamacare because that affected them personally.'

Unconventional warfare: 2,000 hotel guests attending the CPAC convention this month received key cards featuring Carson's face and the draft-friendly 'Run Ben Run!' sogan

In what sounded like the beginnings of a campaign speech, Carson directly attacked Democratic Party messaging.

'They say there's a war on women - give me a break! - racial wars, age wars, income wars, wherever they can drive a wedge into any crack,' Carson said.

'It's much easier to manipulate small groups than it is a whole population.'

'What is going to be necessary is we the people of the United States have to wake up and realize we are being manipulated and we are not each other's enemies. Those enemies are the people who are trying to manipulate us. We need to learn how to identify them. In cases where they are public officials we need to vote them out of office.'

Vernon Robinson, campaign director with the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee, told MailOnline that his pick 'is the only guy who can broaden the base of the GOP by getting a bunch more minority votes. ... he's the only guy who can heal the country.'

Carson has become a lightning rod in the past year, beginning in early 2013 when he delivered health care-related remarks at a National Prayer Breakfast – with President Obama just feet away on the dais – that were openly hostile to the Obamacare program.

At the prayer breakfast, Carson warned about the historical lessons of civilizations that 'destroyed themselves from within.'

'Moral decay. Fiscal irresponsibility. They destroyed themselves,' he said. 'And if you don't think that can happen to America, you get out your books and you start reading.'

Partly because of that speech, Johns Hopkins University withdrew his invitation to speak at its 2013 commencement exercises. Carson is professor emeritus at the university's famed medical school.

No mistaking it: The Republican Party has to respond to the Obama phenomenon by drafting a candidate who can boost GOP minority voting, says Carson 'draft' leader Vernon Robinson

Robinson said Carson doesn't 
coordinate messaging or scheduling with his organization. But as the 
renowned surgeon's name gains national traction, he hasn't discouraged 
the 'draft' movement either.

The result, he said, is a maybe-candidacy with serious heft.

'He came out very close to where Chris Christie was, and the event was in his back yard, run by his guys,' Robinson explained.

Matt Mowers, a former Christie campaign aide, is now executive director of the New Hampshire Republican State Committee, which put on the Nashua event.

The poll of 223 attendees, which does not necessarily scientifically represent Republican voters, was conducted by WPA Opinion Research.

Participants included 65-percent men. A separate 68 per cent were residents of New Hampshire, which will hold the nation's first presidential primary elections.

'What this survey tells is that is that no one candidate has really separated themselves from the potential field in 2016,' said WPA vice president Ryan Steusloff.

'At this point, the nomination is completely up-for-grabs and of the would-be contenders, no one can be ruled out just yet.'
