Astronomers have found the brightest ‘dead star’ ever recorded - but its very existence threatens to undermine our known laws of the universe.

The pulsar - a dense and rapidly spinning remnant of a much larger star left over from a supernova explosion - has the energy of about 10 million suns and was previously thought to be a black hole.

Its discovery, however, breaks a theoretical limit for how bright such an object can get - and it may also mean many other black holes found to date are actually pulsars.

Scientists at Nasa’s California Institute of Technology have found the brightest pulsar ever recorded. High-energy X-rays streaming from a rare and mighty pulsar (shown in magenta), the brightest found to date, can be seen in this  image of the Cigar Galaxy, also known as Messier 82 (M82)

The discovery, published in the journal Nature, was made by scientists at Nasa’s California Institute of Technology (Caltech) using the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuStar).

This pulsar was spotted while astronomers were observing the remnants of a once-in-a-century supernova dubbed SN2014J in the Cigar Galaxy, also known as Messier 82 (M82), 12 million light-years away.

The rare event captured the attention of telescopes around the world including NuStar, and when astronomers looked at the data they found a huge source of X-rays coming from the region.

When a massive star collapses and explodes as a supernova, its crushed core may survive as a compact remnant called a neutron star or pulsar.

This is an object squeezing more mass than the sun's into a sphere the size of Washington DC.

Young pulsars complete a revolution each second, while as they grow older they spin faster and faster, eventually completing thousands of revolutions a second.

They generate beams of radio waves, visible light, X-rays and gamma rays that astronomers observe as pulses whenever the beams sweep past Earth.

Pulsars also generate powerful outflows, or 'winds,' of high-energy particles moving near the speed of light.

The power for all this comes from the pulsar's rapidly spinning magnetic field and over time, as the pulsars wind down, these emissions fade.

More than 30 years ago, astronomers discovered another type of pulsar that completed revolutions in less than 10 milliseconds, reaching incredible rotational speeds of up to 43,000 revolutions per minute. 

This type of star is called a millsecond pulsar. 

While young pulsars usually appear in isolation, more than half of millisecond pulsars occur in binary systems with other stars, which suggests an explanation for their rapid spin. 

At first they thought it was a black hole but, examining the supernova, astronomers noticed pulses of bright X-rays occurring every 1.37 seconds.

Blindingly bright X-rays like this are called ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) and they are normally associated with black holes.

However, the discovery that this ULX was pulsing suggested it was something other than a black hole.

By cross-examining the source with data from another telescope, Chandra, astronomers ruled out 25 other sources that it could have been.

Finally, they realised that a pulsar must be the source - and it was revealed to be the brightest pulsar ever discovered.

‘That was a big surprise,’ said Dr Fiona Harrison, the principal investigator on NuStar.

‘For decades everybody has thought these ultraluminous X-ray sources had to be black holes. 

'But black holes don't have a way to create this pulsing.’

She added: ‘This compact little stellar remnant is a real powerhouse. We've never seen anything quite like it.’

But the discovery has astronomers scratching their heads as, although fascinating, quite how something this bright can form is unknown.

Pulsars are typically between one and two times the mass of the sun.

This new pulsar falls in that same mass range, but shines about 100 times brighter than theory suggests something of its mass should be able to.

‘We've never seen a pulsar even close to being this bright,’ said Dom Walton, a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech who works with NuStar data.

‘Honestly, we don't know how this happens, and theorists will be chewing on it for a long time.’

The discovery was made using Nasa's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuStar), illustration shown. The telescope launched on 13 June 2012 and orbits the Earth at a height of about 340 miles (550km). It is used to focus high-energy X-rays from cosmic sources. Its mission is expected to end in 2016

NuStar is particularly well-suited to make discoveries like this one.

Not only does the space telescope see high-energy X-rays, but it sees them in a unique way.

Rather than snapping images the way that your cell-phone camera does - by integrating the light such that images blur if you move - NuSTAR detects individual particles of X-ray light and marks when they are measured.

That allows the team to do timing analyses and, in this case, to see that the light from the ULX was coming in pulses.

The reason most astronomers had assumed black holes were powering these ULXs is that these X-ray sources are so incredibly bright.

Black holes can be anywhere from 10 to billions of times the mass of the sun, making their gravitational pull much stronger than that of a pulsar.

As matter falls onto the black hole the gravitational energy turns it to heat, which creates X-ray light.

The bigger the black hole, the more energy there is to make the object shine.

The discovery that this ULX is a pulsar is therefore baffling.

It is many times brighter than the Eddington limit -  a basic physics guideline that sets an upper limit on the brightness that an object of a given mass should be able to achieve.

The animation was created by stacking  images taken both while the pulsar was 'on' and 'off,' meaning its beams were either pointed toward Earth or away from us and not visible.

‘This is the most extreme violation of that limit that we've ever seen,’ continued Mr Walton.

‘We have known that things can go above that by a small amount, but this blows that limit away.’

Now that the NuSTAR team has shown that this ULX is a pulsar, Dr Harrison points out that many other known ULXs may in fact be pulsars as well. 

'Everybody had assumed all of these sources were black holes,' she said.

'Now I think people have to go back to the drawing board and decide whether that's really true. 

'This could just be a very unique, strange object, or it could be that they're not that uncommon. We just don't know. We need more observations to see if other ULXs are pulsing.' 

Last month a scientist sensationally claimed it is impossible for black holes to exist, based on her mathematical calculations.

The research was conducted by Professor Laura Mersini-Houghton from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the College of Arts and Scientists.

She claimed that as a star dies, it releases a type of radiation known as Hawking radiation - predicted by Professor Stephen Hawking.

However in this process, Professor Mersini-Houghton believes the star also sheds mass, so much so that it no longer has the density to become a black hole.

Before the black hole can form, she said, the dying star swells and explodes.

The singularity as predicted never forms, and neither does the event horizon - the boundary of the black hole where not even light can escape.

‘I’m still not over the shock,’ said Professor Mersini-Houghton.

‘We’ve been studying this problem for a more than 50 years and this solution gives us a lot to think about.’
