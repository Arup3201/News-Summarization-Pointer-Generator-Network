Maureen Hanlan, 71, has been diagnosed with breast cancer despite having had both her breasts removed in a double mastectomy nine years ago

A pensioner has been diagnosed with breast cancer for a third time – even though she has no breasts.

Maureen Hanlan, 71, from Christchurch, Dorset, thought it was impossible for her to ever get breast cancer again after having both her breasts removed in a double mastectomy.

However, nine years later she is once again facing a battle to survive, after what she believed was a skin rash turned out to be breast cancer.

Her doctors said the chances of cancer returning after a mastectomy were so rare they had never encountered or even heard of such a case.

Ms Hanlan now faces a lifetime of taking anti-cancer drugs to keep the tumour at bay.

Formerly a theatre worker, she said the high profile case of Angelina Jolie had led people to believe that the operation was a fix-all solution.

The actress had a double mastectomy in 2013 after finding out she had a gene linked to cancer.

However, Ms Hanlan said: 'I was totally convinced after having the mastectomy that I would not get breast cancer any more. 

'Nobody had told me you could still get breast cancer after such a major operation.

'I read in the newspaper that Angelina Jolie had had a double mastectomy after finding out she had the cancer gene.

'I wonder if she was aware that, although very rare, she could still get breast cancer?'

Doctors said while Ms Hanlan's experience is 'unusual' it is 'not unheard of'.

During a double mastectomy, nearly all of the breast tissue is removed, but cancer can still return to the chest area.

The more lymph nodes (small masses of tissue that help the body fight infection and disease) with cancer at the time of the mastectomy, the higher the chance the disease may return. 

Breast cancer cells can also spread to other areas of the body through the lymph nodes and tumours could grow in places including the lungs, bones and skin.

Ms Hanlan was told she needed the drastic operation after suffering two breast cancer scares, the first in 1990 and then again 2002.

She opted for a double mastectomy despite the fact that cancer was only present in one of her breasts because her grandmother had died of the disease.

All was well for the next 10 years until she developed a worrying, lumpy rash over both of her breasts.

Actress Angelina Jolie  had a double mastectomy in 2013 after finding out she had a gene linked to cancer. She was told she had an 87 per cent chance of breast cancer due to the inherited gene. But Ms Hanlan believes her case has led people to believe that the operation is a 'fix all solution'

She visited her GP who referred her to a dermatologist but was told she would have to wait three months for an appointment on the NHS.

Ms Hanlan opted to go private and secured a consultation within a week - a decision she admits probably saved her life.

'That's probably why I'm still here today,' she said, 'The dermatologist who saw me said we should do a biopsy just in case it was anything more serious and that was what revealed the cancer.'

She said she was 'absolutely terrified' when the doctor told her she had breast cancer.

While most people have no further problems, sometimes breast cancer can return. 

Local recurrence

If breast cancer comes back in the chest/breast area, or in the skin near the original site or the scar, this is called local recurrence.

This means there are remaining cancer cells in the local area which have not been completely removed by the initial surgery or treatment.

It is not the same as the cancer spreading. 

If this happens, patients usually need further surgery, but it is treatable.

Regional recurrence (also called locally advanced)

Breast cancer can also come back when it has spread beyond the breast and the lymph nodes under the arm  into the tissues and lymph nodes around the chest, neck and under the breastbone. 

Treatment for regional recurrence will depend on previous treatments, but could include surgery, radiotherapy and drug treatments.

People who have a regional recurrence are thought to have an increased risk of cancer cells spreading to other areas of the body. 

Treatments such as chemotherapy, hormone and targeted therapies are given because they are systemic treatments which work throughout the whole body.

When breast cancer spreads to other parts of the body such as the bones, lungs, liver or brain, this is called secondary breast cancer.

'First of all I was shocked - I couldn't believe it. I was totally devastated,' she added.

'I had been so happy that day - it was my sister's birthday and I'd just bought a property, a beautiful garden flat, and I was so high on that.

'I went into the surgery bouncing with joy and I sat down and the nurse asked me if I wanted my results. I said "yes, of course", not thinking for a second that she was going to say those awful words again.

'Then she just said it - "it's breast cancer again" - and I just couldn't believe it, I just broke down.

'The doctor cuddled me and hugged me and said "I'm so sorry".

'I said "I can't go through chemo again, I just can't do it".'

She will now have to take the anti-cancer drug Tamoxifen for life. 

Alongside the help of her son, Jake, she says she could not have got through the ordeal without the help of cancer charity Macmillan.

'They were so helpful to me emotionally and financially and even paid for me to go away for a holiday.

'They also gave me a visit at home one evening when I was feeling pretty rough.

'They really did see me through that bad time, and I will always be thankful to them for that.'

Ms Hanlan is now hoping to find out whether any other cancer sufferers in the UK have gone through the same ordeal.

She said: 'There was a lot of emotion there, but happiness at the end of it.

'I'm going to keep fighting it, I'm not going anywhere, I'm going to stay here and annoy more people and grow old disgracefully, as they say.

'I should probably be happy that I'm still alive, that I'm still here, but I don't want to leave it at that.

'I'm the type of person who needs an answer, and I want to help other cancer sufferers.

'There must be other people who have been through the same thing, or who know what it is.

'It's been a long bumpy journey, with lots of highs and lows.

'However, I'm extremely grateful I'm still here to tell the tale and I'm just hoping to God that I will have a clean bill of health for the rest of my days.' 

A leading breast cancer charity said that Ms Hanlan's third cancer diagnosis following a double masectomy was 'unusual.'

'It is not unheard of but extremely unusual,' said Sally Greenbrook, a senior policy advisor at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, which funds research into prevention, detection and treatment of the UK's most common cancer.

Ms Hanlan will now take anti-cancer drugs for the rest of her life to keep the tumour at bay. She hopes to find others like her - who developed breast cancer despite having had a mastectomy

'One in eight women will face breast cancer in their lifetime. After having a double mastectomy, it would be very rare for breast cancer to re-occur,' she added.

'It is always going to be a shock when breast cancer comes back, especially after a double mastectomy,' she said.

'It is unusual, but we have heard of such cases coming up. After removing most of the breast tissue, it can recur in the chest wall.'

It could also spread to cells in other parts of the body, even after invasive surgery, and guarantees can never be made, she added.

She reiterated that mastectomies hit the headlines in 2013 after actress Angelina Jolie revealed she had undergone the surgery as a preventative measure as her BRCA gene mutation made her a high risk for developing breast cancer.

Emphasising that star's preventative procedure was different from Maureen's treatment for cancer, Ms Greenbrook said anecdotal evidence showed that Ms Jolie going public with her story had encouraged many women with a family history of breast cancer to come forward for tests.
