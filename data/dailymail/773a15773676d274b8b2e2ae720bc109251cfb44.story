Sam Allardyce turns 60 on Sunday. This season he’s proving that you are never too old to learn new tricks.

From being booed off the pitch last season to winning in style this time around, things have changed dramatically at West Ham. The football has been transformed and with that, so has the mood at Upton Park.

For Big Sam, so often associated with pragmatic, long-ball football, it has been the biggest turnaround in 20 years of management. His team have been playing with style, pace and, most importantly, are getting the results to go with it.

West Ham bought well in the summer and while it’s always easier to play good football with better players, you can’t over-estimate how important the manager is.

Compared to this time last year, there were eight new starters in West Ham’s last fixture, so credit to the manager for bedding in those new faces so quickly.

With Neil McDonald — a colleague of mine at Everton, where passing football was always the mantra — and Teddy Sheringham on the staff, the balance has now been tipped.

Who would have thought that we would be talking about Sam using midfield diamonds and 4-3-3s? He has shown great tactical awareness and flexibility and the fans and the players are loving it.

Allardyce must have been the only man in the country who thought Stewart Downing could play as a No 10 at the tip of a midfield diamond. It was a masterstroke and Downing is a player reborn. We talk about Brendan Rodgers’ tactical ability at Anfield but Downing will have loved wiping the smile off his face when West Ham beat Liverpool 3-1.

Downing has now almost become a barometer for how the team performs. He has created the most chances in the League — level with Cesc Fabregas on 22 — and has made almost twice as many passes per game as last season. He is playing with a smile on his face and giving everything for the cause — something West Ham fans demand as a bare minimum.

With players such as Alex Song, who has spent most of his career playing passing football, Allardyce has seen the way forward and it’s as if he now trusts his side to get the ball down and play.

The defence has been consistent and it’s good to see two young English full backs getting their chance. 

With Alex Song now back in full flow, it is obvious Allardyce wants to get the ball down and play

Carl Jenkinson has the potential to be a top player and Aaron Cresswell is a shining example to any young English professional. Released by Liverpool at youth level, he kept going, worked his way up via Tranmere and Ipswich and is now carving out a career at the top level.

Of course it always helps when you have players who score goals. You almost expect West Ham to score whenever Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho are on the pitch. They are players who create a real buzz among the fans.

The atmosphere at Upton Park is in sharp contrast to last season when it became an ordeal to play at home. It’s a tough ground and the fans expect their side to play ‘the West Ham way’.

It was similar for Allardyce at Newcastle where he was almost driven out because of the fans’ expectations of style. That experience has helped him at West Ham and he has adapted.

It’s still early days and if improvements don’t continue things could take a turn for the worse. So let’s hope West Ham fans can enjoy the positive play for a long time to come.

PS

I was at the National Football Museum this week to see, among others, Patrick Vieira, Alan Shearer and Michael Owen inducted into the Hall of Fame. 

Many worthy people were honoured and we paid tribute to the Preston Invincibles of the 1880s. This week was also the tenth anniversary of Arsenal’s Invincibles, so let’s hope they don’t leave it more than 100 years to honour that team!
