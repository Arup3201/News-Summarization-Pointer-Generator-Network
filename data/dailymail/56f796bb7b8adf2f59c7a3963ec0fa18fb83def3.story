A six-month old Quokka born in Sydney’s Taronga Zoo has captured the hearts of zookeepers.

The female joey, which has been named ‘Meeuk Mia’ or ‘Mia’ for short is the youngest of three Quokkas born at the zoo this breeding season.

Keepers say the Quokka will have an important role to play at Toronga’s Eduction Centre, where he will be meeting children and helping them learn about the importance of looking after native wildlife.

Quokkas are one of the smallest wallaby species in Australia.

They are found in high number on Rottnest Island in Western Australia and in small populations in the south-west of WA.

The species have been classified as vulnerable due to their geographical range being limited.

Quokkas were once abundant throughout Australia but declined rapidly due to the arrival of the dingo in Australia about 3,500 years ago.

Thankfully today they are showing signs of recovery due to the Department of Parks and Wildlife’s operations.

Experts say that Quokkas appear to live in territories with the areas defended by dominant males on Rottnest Island.

According to Tonga Zookeeper Bec Russell- Cook, it is imperative that Quokkas are kept in zoos to stop them from dying out.

“If a natural disaster or disease were to hit Rottnest Island it would be devasting for Quokkas, which is why an insurance population is so important,” said Bec.

Bec has been caring for Mia since she was born.

Meeuk Mia, whose name means “halo of the moon” in the language of the Noongar people from Western Australia, is already growing in confidence.

Bec has spent weeks carrying around a makeshift pouch and waking at 2am for one of five daily bottle feeds.

“She’s quite the little climber. She loves climbing on the other keepers’ shoulders and heads during morning tea and I even woke up one night to find her looking at me from atop a mountain of pillows next to my bed,” said Bec.

Quokkas have thick, coarse, grey-brown fur and short, rounded fluffy ears.

Their tails measure 24–31 cm long and they have shorter hind legs than other macropod species.

Quokkas are very unusual as they are able to survive in an environment virtually devoid of freshwater and they can climb trees.

Quokkas have been used in medical research on muscular dystrophy as they suffer from the same disease

For now, Toronga Zoo's resident Quokka Mia’s diet consists of a special milk mixture and the occasional nibble of native grass and flowers.

However she will be introduced to solids in the coming weeks.

“The 2am bottle feeds are certainly the toughest, as Mia gets tired and falls asleep while she’s drinking,” said Bec.

Mia will continue to be nursed by Bec until the joey is old enough to join Taronga’s trio of hand-raised Quokkas, Poppy Lou, Autumn and Jarrah, at the Education Centre.

Toronga Zoo is part of a national breeding program, helping to establish an insurance population to safeguard the species into the future.
