Team news

Liverpool

Simon Mignolet will return to the Liverpool goal at the expense of the injured Brad Jones when the Reds welcome Swansea to Anfield

The Belgian had been "indefinitely" dropped by manager Brendan Rodgers, but was called upon from the bench when Jones suffered a thigh injury against Burnley on Boxing Day.

Simon Mignolet replaced Brad Jones in the Liverpool goal on Boxing Day, and is expected to continue

Fabio Borini returns to the squad following suspension but defenders Dejan Lovren and Glen Johnson (both groin) and Jon Flanagan (knee) are still not fit.

Provisional squad: Mignolet, Toure, Skrtel, Sakho, Henderson, Gerrard, Lucas, Markovic, Coutinho, Sterling, Lallana, Manquillo, Moreno, Enrique, Can, Lambert, Balotelli, Ward, Borini.

Swansea

Jefferson Montero is set to miss Swansea's Barclays Premier League trip to Liverpool on Monday night.

The Ecuador winger, who has been in fine form lately, damaged a hamstring in the Boxing Day win against Aston Villa and is unlikely to feature although he will be assessed in the next 24 hours.

There have been three goals scored in the opening five minutes of the last two league meetings between these two teams.

Daniel Sturridge has scored four goals in three Premier League games against Swansea City in a Liverpool shirt.

Ex-Liverpool player Jonjo Shelvey has scored in both of his appearances for Swansea against his former club.

There have been three penalties in the last two Premier League games between Liverpool and Swansea at Anfield.

Last season’s 3-4 defeat is the highest scoring away match that Swansea have been involved in away from home since they reached the Premier League (seven goals).
