Britain was last night reported to be in talks with Germany over a secret deal to help their car industry in return for support for our banks.

Representatives of David  Cameron and Chancellor Angela Merkel have been discussing a German plan to delay the introduction of caps on carbon dioxide emissions that could harm BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi.

In return, the UK wants help to protect the banking sector, which is lobbying to reduce the impact of Brussels regulations.

Officials have suggested measures including the disclosure of the tax that banks pay in every country, and changes to regulations proposed by the European Commission for the hedge fund industry.

And Britain also wants German help to protect taxpayers from having to contribute to a fund to help ailing eurozone banks.

Last night Lib Dem sources told The Times that the proposed deal also included a request for help with Britain’s attempt to overturn an EU cap on bank bonuses, which would limit them to 200 per cent of salary.

A government source confirmed that it involved trading support for the banking sector in return for helping German car companies.

However, the source denied that there was a specific link to bank bonuses as this issue was no longer in EU politicians’ hands.

George Osborne wants to strike down plans for the cap on bonuses, which takes effect in the new year.

Last month, Britain launched a challenge to the cap in the European Court of Justice, but a ruling could take two years.

One Lib Dem MEP involved in the negotiations over the carbon dioxide cap suggested that, by seeking to support Germany, Britain could end up penalising its own car industry.

Chris Davies, a member of the European Parliament’s negotiating team on the issue, said: ‘Giving priority to the interests of German luxury carmakers may help David Cameron benefit the bankers who can afford to buy them, but it doesn’t help British drivers or carmakers here.’
