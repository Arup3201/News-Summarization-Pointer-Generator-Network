Keepers at Taronga Western Plains Zoo are looking for help to name one of their latest additions to their family of otters.

The oriental small-clawed otter pups were born on January 8 at the zoo located in Dubbo in New South Wales' central west. 

While keepers will name two of the pups, they are enlisting the help of the public to christen the third.

The oriental small-clawed otter pups were born on January 8 to parents Emiko and Pocket

The trio include two females and one male, and were born to Emiko and Pocket. It is Emiko's second litter.

A statement from the zoo said the pair were 'exceptional parents' and were taking 'great care of their offspring.

'Both Emiko and Pocket are very hands-on parents and have been displaying ideal nurturing behaviours,' keeper Ian Anderson said.

'The pups have been in the den to date and we have been monitoring them via a video camera, to ensure they are growing and developing well.'

The birth of this litter comes off the success of last year's first litter as part of the zoo's breeding program.

'The older siblings born in 2014 have been assisting their parents with the daily care of the pups including grooming and babysitting the new arrivals,' Mr Anderson said.

'Oriental small-clawed otters are a social species and live in large families so it is anticipated that the family will remain together for the near future.'

The trio had their first vaccinations and health check on Friday.

Right now, they are still spending a lot of time in their den and rarely seen at the zoo.

Keepers expect them to will start venturing out more often with their parents and older siblings to explore their exhibit and to learn to swim over the coming weeks.

'By the end of April, we will expect to see the pups out and about more regularly in the exhibit with their parents and older siblings,' Mr Anderson said.
