George Lucas has axed plans for a sprawling film studio on farmland north of San Francisco because he doesn't want his company to be seen as 'an evil empire.'

Lucasfilm, the force behind the Star Wars franchise, surprised officials in Marin County by pulling the plug on the controversial Grady Ranch project citing bitter opposition from neighbours and delays in the approval process.

The axed plans included a 269,000-sq
 ft digital media studio, a 51-ft tall mission-style 
compound with two 85-ft towers, two indoor sound stages and an 
outdoor stage of nearly 7,000 sq ft.

There would have been screening 
rooms, guest housing, a general store, employee cafeteria and wine cave 
for private tastings and storage at the venue about 15 miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Moving on: George Lucas' company Lucasfilm said in a statement that it had withdrawn the plans because it wished to be seen as a 'creative asset, not as an evil empire'

Lucasfilm and its backers argued the 
new production studio would generate hundreds of high-paying jobs and 
tax revenue and hoped to break new ground next year.

But yesterday they decided to withdraw from the 25-year battle.

'We love working and living in 
Marin, but the residents of Lucas Valley have fought this project for 25
 years, and enough is enough,' the company said in a statement.

'We have several opportunities to 
build the production stages in communities that see us as a creative 
asset, not as an evil empire.'

The company said it would construct 
new facilities elsewhere and hoped to sell the historic farmland to a 
developer interested in building low-income housing in the region.

Local business leaders who championed the project said they were devastated by the announcement.

'It sends a very disturbing message 
to any company thinking about growing or starting in Marin,' said 
Cynthia Murray, president of the North Bay Leadership Council. 'It's a 
model project. If this project can't get approved, I don't know what 
project can get approved.'

The Grady Ranch project would have marked a major expansion of Lucasfilm in Lucas Valley, which has been home to its Skywalker Ranch for three decades - the valley is named after a 19th century rancher with no relation to the Star Wars creator.

But the project generated strong opposition from homeowners and environmentalists who said it would increase traffic, noise and environmental damage on the pristine countryside, despite company promises to preserve open space and reduce impacts on the community.

The Marin County planning commission unanimously approved the studio project in February, but opponents appealed that decision to the county Board of Supervisors last month, leading to further delays.

'The level of bitterness and anger expressed by the homeowners in Lucas Valley has convinced us that, even if we were to spend more time and acquire the necessary approvals, we would not be able to maintain a constructive relationship with our neighbours,' Lucasfilm said in the statement.

Liz Dale, president of the Lucas Valley Estates Homeowners Association, said she was surprised by the decision.

'We are glad we don't have to worry about the potential impacts we were worried about,' she said. 'We don't want to describe it as good news or bad news, but I can understand why another location would be better for this type of facility.'

Dale said any proposed housing development on the property would have to be 'suited to the zoning, the people who live here and the people who come here.'Lucasfilm spokeswoman Lynne Hale said two cities have contacted the company offering 'substantial incentives' to build the new studio, but she could not discuss specific locations.

'It makes me sad that we cannot build the studio in Marin,' Hale said. 'Other communities understand the economic and educational benefits of having a company such as Lucasfilm in their cities.'
