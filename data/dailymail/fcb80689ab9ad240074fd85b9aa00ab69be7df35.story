On average, savvy shoppers polled in the survey estimate the tactic will save them £78 in total.

The news comes as online retailers gear up for Cyber Monday (December 2), the biggest British online shopping day before Christmas, which is set to see a record £1billion spent in just 24 hours.

According to the survey, British women will be buying more Christmas presents
online than in the shops for the first time.

Female Christmas shoppers say they are set to splash out more than ever, with the average total spend going up to £331. 

Gift buying online has been helped by a trend for 'showrooming' which sees shoppers browse for gifts in stores and then find them at bargain prices on the internet.

More than half of British women (58 per cent) will
be doing the majority of their Christmas shopping online this year, and
56.9 per cent said they would be spending nearly twice as much online this year
as they did last year.

The
main reason for women gave for shopping online was that it was cheaper (40 per cent) while 29.4 per cent said they can't bear shopping at this time of year because of overcrowding.

A spokesperson for Escentual.com who commissioned the survey, said: 'It's hardly surprising that showrooming for Christmas has become so popular when shoppers are finding that it saves them nearly 20 per cent on their bill.

'The women in our survey said they would save £78 on an average Christmas shop of £331, and they said beauty products and fragrances was one of the areas where they would find a better deal online.'
