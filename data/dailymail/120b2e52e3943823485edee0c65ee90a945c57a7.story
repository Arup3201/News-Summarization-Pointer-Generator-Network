Arsenal players have been preparing in training ahead of Sunday's Community Shield clash against Manchester City.

Under the watchful eye of Arsene Wenger was new signing Alexis Sanchez, who could become one of several debutantes for the Gunners at Wembley.

 Also in action was recent signing Calum Chambers, who could start at centre-back alongside Laurent Koscielny, and Mathieu Debuchy and right-back in place of the departed Bacary Sagna.

Joel Campbell, who is back at the club after several loan spells, could also feature against Manchester city, but new goalkeeper David Ospina is a doubt with injury.

Out to impress were Yaya Sanogo, Jack Wilshere and a vocal-looking Mathieu Flamini - who was perhaps trying to highlight himself as a potential new captain, following the impending departure of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona.

Elsewhere, German trio Mesut Ozil, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski remained absent following their triumphant World Cup campaign. But Santi Cazorla, who has been linked with a move away, looked in high spirits. 

Arsenal are set to play in their first Community Shield since 2005, when they lost 2-1 to Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, and are like for their first victory in the competition since the season before, when they triumphed 3-1 Manchester United thanks to goals from Gilberto Silva, Jose Antonio Reyes and an own goal from Mikael Silvestre.
