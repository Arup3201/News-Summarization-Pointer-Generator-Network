Callous Sharon Greaves duped an elderly man out of his life savings. She has been jailed for more than three years

A drug addict conwoman left a 
'proud' pensioner penniless after duping her way into his affections and
pretending they would get married.

Sick Sharon Greaves, 52, preyed
on 89-year-old George Girt, convincing him they were in a relationship 
and persuading him to lavish her with hundreds of pounds worth of 
clothes for a phantom wedding.

Entangling the victim in a web of 
deception, Greaves also conned the pensioner into taking out a £1,000 
loan for the fake ceremony.

But in reality the career criminal, 
who had 74 previous offences on her record, spent the cash on drugs, 
leaving Mr Girt with virtually nothing and at his 'lowest point'. He 
was forced to move out of his home and in with his daughters.

A judge at Preston Crown Court yesterday jailed Greaves for three years and two months after she admitted six counts of theft.

In
a statement read out to the court, Mr Girt told how the heartless 
criminal had changed his life. 'I was at my lowest point,' he said.

'I am a proud man from a generation who doesn’t ask for help. I had to swallow my pride and ask my daughter for help.'

Greaves
- branded 'remorseless' by police - befriended the pensioner while 
living opposite him in Layton, Lancs. Although the pair never started a 
physical relationship, Greaves convinced her victim her intentions were 
genuine.

The court heard 
Greaves told a pack of lies, twice cancelling the 'wedding' but 
convincing the victim the ceremony would finally go ahead on March 31 
last year.

But no registry office had been booked and by that time Mr Girt had handed over nearly £3,000.

Saul
Brody, prosecuting, said: 'It is the Crown’s case that she deliberately
targeted him. She got herself into his affections, firstly visiting and
spending time with him and thereafter, developing a relationship with 
him.'

Detective Constable Marc Armstrong, who led the investigation, said: 'It’s had a devastating impact on him and his family’s lives and Greaves has shown no remorse for what she did.

'It isn’t just the financial loss, the main thing to him is the loss of his independence, because he has had to move in with his daughters.

'He had lived in Blackpool for 11 years and enjoyed where he lived but it’s all been taken away from him because he thought he had found someone he could spend his last years with.'

Greaves sobbed in the dock as her barrister Peter Horgan described her long struggle with drugs.

He said: 'For 20 years she has struggled with a drug addiction. In recent times she has lost the support of her husband which had an impact upon her.'

Mr Girt is believed to have relocated to North Wales.
