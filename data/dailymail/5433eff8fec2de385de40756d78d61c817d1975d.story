Jelly babies: Lilly Fitzpatrick, of Longbridge, Birmingham, realised her father Dave, 41, was having a hypoglycemic attack

A diabetic father's life was saved by his six-year-old daughter who fed him some jelly babies when he nearly slipped into a coma.

Lilly Fitzpatrick, of Longbridge, Birmingham, realised Dave, 41, was having a hypoglycemic attack and ran to get a ‘life saver’ box to get him the sweets and boost his glucose levels.

The warehouse worker's brain stops functioning correctly when his blood sugar levels fall - and he said an attack can see him lose the ability of speech and ‘wander around like a zombie’.

During the latest hypoglycemic attack last Wednesday, Lilly and her younger brother Jacob were in the house with their father while their mother Michelle Lewis, 39, was at work. He could have died if Lilly had not reacted quickly.

Lilly tried to call her mother and relatives - but when she could not get through, dialled 999 to tell the emergency services what was happening.

Ms Lewis said: ‘Because of Dave’s condition - we’ve taught Lilly what to do since she was around three.

‘She loves Harry Styles - so she’s got a One Direction “life saver” box - which contains glucogel, Coca Cola, jelly babies and chocolate bars - in case her dad suffers an attack.

‘Lilly woke up and found her dad wandering around like a zombie. He fell back in a chair - so Lilly felt his head and realised he was hot and having an attack.

‘She ran to her One Direction “life saver” box for her dad and got the jelly babies out and fed them to him and called the emergency services. She also got his glucogel - and administered it in his cheek, inside his mouth.

‘The emergency services got her to ask him some questions but he was unconscious and disorientated so wasn’t talking to her.

‘The police arrived but by this time Dave’s sugar levels had risen. An ambulance and parademic then turned up and checked him over.’

Her father suffers from Type 1 diabetes and has had the condition since he was 15 years old.

'I’m beaming with pride, I’m so proud of her. If she hadn’t reacted - he would have slipped into a coma and he may have died within a couple of hours'

Ms Lewis added: ‘I’m beaming with pride, I’m so proud of her. If she hadn’t reacted - he would have slipped into a coma and he may have died within a couple of hours.

‘She was really calm doing what she did and was focused on getting her dad some jelly babies.

'Not only did she have to deal with her dad but her younger brother Jacob, who was crying and was frightened.’
