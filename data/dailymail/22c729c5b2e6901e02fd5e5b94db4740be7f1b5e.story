Two days after being sacked as England's one-day cricket captain, Alastair Cook put his troubles behind him to return to sporting action – and duly showed his prowess by scoring two superb centuries with ease.

The only problem was that he was doing so with a dart not a bat in his hand – and, in a far cry from the pristine surroundings of Lord's, the audience he was playing to was full of drunk punters wearing Christmas jumpers…as well as a couple of reindeer in the stands.

The 29-year-old, who is still England's Test captain, took to the Alexandra Palace stage in north London on Monday evening, shortly before the start of  day five of the World Darts Championship, for an entertaining 'challenge' match with England fast bowler James Anderson.

And, in spite of his recent woes, Cook enjoyed a rare moment of sporting triumph in this one-leg shootout. 

'I was nervous up there,' admitted Cook, who held his stag party a few years ago at Ally Pally with a group of mates. 'I scored a 100 up there – and it's the first time I have done that on TV for a while. It was amazing up there but my legs were shaking.'

Knowing how keen the players are on their arrows during overseas Tours, the England and Wales Cricket Board approached the Professional Darts Corporation a few months back to arrange this special invitational match.

What the English cricket authorities could not have anticipated was that the match would take place days after the decision to demote Cook from the World Cup squad and strip him of the captaincy because of his poor scoring form.

Nonetheless, Cook, who is 30 on Christmas day, still turned up to participate. He did the full walk-on, wearing a T-shirt with 'Alastair 'Bed n Breakfast' Cook' emblazed on his back. 

Anderson rightly used the moniker 'The Swinger'.

In the practice room beforehand, Cook had achieved a 13-dart leg and he brought that form to the oche. 

Throwing with his right, despite being a left-handed batsman, Cook scored a 100 and 140 – and despite missing seven darts at double 13 he eventually sealed the match with a double 11 attempt.

Cook might not be playing at the Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in February – but perhaps the World Cup of Darts in Frankfurt in the summer would be a viable option instead.
