The Roy Hodgson press conference has now drawn to a close for the broadcast media (the rest will be under embargo for tonight) and so that's where we'll end our rolling coverage as well.

For full details of the 23-man squad selected by the England manager this afternoon, click here.

'The squad has changed due to injury. We lost four players who were clearly in our thoughts. Theo Walcott, Jay Rodriguez and Kyle Walker. So my list has changed quite a few times.'

Hodgson, sat in the Vauxhall car factory, has just been asked whether the England squad is a 'family saloon' or a 'sports car'. He replied simply that he was 'very happy to drive it.'

Hodgson adds that Wayne Rooney will bring his own physios with him when on holiday this week to ensure his groin injury doesn't get in the way.

When asked whether it was a concern, Rooney said: If it's up to wayne then there's no doubt. In this week where I've told them to forgot about football he has brought physios with him to make sure he is right for when we meet.'

On possible injury problems: 'The only player who poses a question is Phil Jones. But my research points to it being a three week injury.'

He adds that John Stones will be his replacement if Jones does not make the injury deadline of June 2.

On the decision to include Frank Lampard: ' Frank has been captain of the team, and also vice captain to Steven Gerrard. His leadership qualities and his ability will help. He is a very important part of the England set up.

'It would be wrong to focus on the young and less experienced players. We have a lot of experience in this team'

On the decision to leave out Ashley Cole, Hodgson said: 'It was an incredibly hard decision. Everyone knows what Ashley Cole is. I am unbelievably grateful for the gracious way he took the decision. Circumstances will prove if it is the right one.

'Luke Shaw has had a wonderful season and has captured the headlines with his form and his ability.'

Roy Hodgson is now giving his press conference. He says: 'It's a big day for me. I hope the squad will give a very good account of themselves in Brazil and not let the country down.'

Matt Barlow: By my calculations… Roy’s 23 have 610 caps between them at an average of 26.5.

Without Gerrard, Lampard and Rooney, the other 20 average 15.45.Average age: 26. Two teenagers. Five thirtysomethings.
