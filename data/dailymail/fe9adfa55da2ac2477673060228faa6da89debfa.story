Sunglasses have a habit of getting lost on holiday. If you're not leaving them somewhere by accident, then you're wearing them in the sea and they're floating off into a watery grave.

Now a company has found a way to guard against one of those problems - creating floating sunglasses, so you'll never lose them in the sea again.

The Dragon Alliance specs will always find their way to the surface, even if taken off metres underwater.

Brilliant invention: Dragon Alliance have launched range of sunglasses that float on water

Does this float your boat?: New shades have a special frame which enable them to float

Produced for those with an active lifestyle in & around the water, the H2O Floatable Collection is made with a specially formulated injected frame that has been designed to stay afloat. 

But if you’re not a water-skier or surfer, their stylish design makes them suitable for casual sun-worshippers too.

The shades come in four different styles, and include Double Dos, The Jam and Vantage. 

Prices start from £134.90.
