A pod of captive dolphins are to be killed one-by-one in a traditional dolphin hunt in western Japan, where local fisherman corral the mammals into a secluded bay before killing many for meat.

At least 250 dolphins have been trapped in a 
cove, with the prettiest selected for sale to aquariums and the rest 
butchered for meat, was damaging the reputation of Japan.

Today the Japanese widow of John Lennon added her voice to pleas to dolphin fishermen that they stop their hunt, days after the US ambassador to Tokyo waded into the row.

Yoko Ono published an open letter to 
the men of Taiji, the small town made famous by the Oscar-winning film 
'The Cove' which depicts the annual bloodbath, in which she urged them 
to halt the cull for the 'future of Japan'.

It 'will give an excuse for big countries and their children in China, India and Russia to speak ill of Japan,' she wrote.

'I
 am sure that it is not easy, but please consider the safety of the 
future of Japan, surrounded by many powerful countries which are always 
looking for the chance to weaken the power of our country.'

Sea Shepherd, one of the animal protection groups that monitor fishermen in Taiji, said more than 200 dolphins had been rounded up into the secluded bay

Yoko Ono's comments were welcomed on Monday by fugitive eco-activist Paul Watson, who said he hoped it would help convince Tokyo to put a halt to the practice

'At this very politically sensitive time, (the hunt) will make the children of the world hate the Japanese.

'For many, many years and decades we have worked hard to receive true understanding of the Japanese from the world,' she said.

'But
 what we enjoy now, can be destroyed literally in one day. I beg of you 
to consider our precarious situation after the nuclear disaster (which 
could very well affect the rest of the world, as well).'

Harsh conditions: These poles are deployed above the water, and then the fishermen hit a flange on the top of the poles with a hammer, creating a cacophony that drives the dolphins back out to sea

Annual process: The fishing crew are pictured transferring several dolphins into the 250-strong pod

Rounded up: The dolphins were forced to wait in the pen for 19 hours until the holding reached critical mass

The reference was to the 2011 triple meltdowns at Fukushima after their reactors were swamped by a huge tsunami.

The
 letter, which was posted on her 'Imagine Peace' website and addressed 
to 'Japanese fishermen of Taiji', bore her signature and was dated 20 
January, 2014. At the foot, it said: 'cc Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo
 Abe'.

Ono's intervention came just days after US ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy tweeted her disapproval.

Tradition: Each year the fishermen capture and kill a huge amount of dolphins, putting the population at risk

Did she kill herself? There is speculation that the mother of this albino dolphin trapped by Japanese fishermen in a cove has committed suicide after being torn apart from her baby

'Deeply
 concerned by inhumaneness of drive hunt dolphin killing. USG (US 
Government) opposes drive hunt fisheries,' wrote Kennedy, the only 
surviving child of assassinated US President John F Kennedy, on January 
17.

Sea
 Shepherd, one of the animal protection groups that monitor fishermen in
 Taiji, said more than 200 dolphins had been rounded up into the 
secluded bay.

'It
 takes up to 20 to 30 minutes for these dolphins to die, where they 
bleed out, suffocate or drown in the process of being dragged to the 
butcher house,' Sea Shepherd activist Melissa Sehgal told Reuters.

Heavy machinery: Fishermen hoist a dolphin out of the sea, on its way to either lifetime captivity or death

Boat: 'Banger boats' use poles and flanges to make unpleasant sounds, driving the dolphins to specific places

Preparation: Fishermen and trainers  unload the orange nets yesterday - just 24 hours before decision day

Sehgal added that the bottlenose dolphins were also valuable as they can be trained to do tricks.

The Taiji fishing union was not immediately available for comment.

Taiji
 came into the spotlight after the 2009 release of 'The Cove', directed 
by former National Geographic photographer Louie Psihoyos. It shows the 
hunt in grisly detail and calls for an end to commercial fishing of 
marine mammals.

Fishermen 
say the cull is a traditional part of their livelihood in an area that 
has fished dolphins and whales for thousands of years.

The
 dolphin hunting season runs yearly from September to March, the Taiji 
fishing association said. Sea Shepherd says 176 marine mammals had been 
killed this season, including bottlenose, spotted, striped and risso's 
dolphins.

Exact monitoring is difficult, with fishermen erecting tarpaulins over their killing area and blocking access to the cove.

The dolphins will be uncomfortably oblivious of the impending doom some of them will suffer at the hands of the fishermen. They are captured around four to five at a time until enough of them are collected for 'selection'

Treatment: The fishermen brutally kill the dolphins they do not set free or capture using a sharp spike or spear

Cramped: The cove does not provide much space for the dolphins to swim, forcing them to huddle up in groups

Yoko Ono's comments were 
welcomed on Monday by fugitive eco-activist Paul Watson, who said he 
hoped it would help convince Tokyo to put a halt to the practice.

'Hopefully
 this would put additional pressure to convince the Japanese government 
that this really has no place in the 21st century,' he said.

Watson,
 who is the founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, is now in 
the United States where he arrived last year saying he wanted to 
challenge a court injunction.

Japanese
 authorities are seeking his extradition and describe methods used by 
Watson's Sea Shepherd group against whaling ships - for example blocking
 the boats' propellers - as 'terrorist' acts.

Watson
 was arrested in May last year in Frankfurt on a warrant from Costa 
Rica, where he is wanted on charges stemming from a high-seas 
confrontation over shark finning in 2002.

The Canadian-born activist fled from Germany but arrived in California on October 28, more than a year later.
