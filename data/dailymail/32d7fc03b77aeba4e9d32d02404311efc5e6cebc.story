Barcelona duo Jordi Alba and Rafinha decided to have some fun during their time at St George's Park by taking penalties with a large exercise ball.

Both players had a lot of success with the ball when it came to taking penalties - despite the size of the piece of gym equipment.

The worst effort came from Alba who managed to balloon the ball over the bar from 12 yards.

Rafinha also sent one off target with his last effort going just wide of the post.

The two full-back's goalkeeping skills left a lot to be desired as they failed to stop the tame shots.

Barcelona boss Luis Enrique will definitely not be calling on the duo to have a stint in goal if Marc-Andre ter Stegen or Claudio Bravo were to get injured during the course of the season.
