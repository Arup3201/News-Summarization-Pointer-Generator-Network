Being such a huge golf fan, and living so close to the site of The Open, John Singleton planned to spend the next few days working as a volunteer at The Royal Liverpool Golf Club at Hoylake. 

But instead, the 30-year-old - whose day job is a fork lifter - will be teeing off alongside the likes of Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy tees, as he competes in the world's greatest golf tournament.

Mr Singleton, who works only a few miles away from site in The Wirral, qualified for the British Open on his very first try - despite thinking his golf career was over.

Mr Singleton once tried to make it as a professional golfer but soon started a day job at the resin factory Advanced Electrical Varnishes, where he works the 8am to 4.30pm shift.

There, he 
drives a forklift truck and mixes the resin, a thick compound used as a 
waterproof coating for wiring, circuit boards and other electrical 
devices.

But now he is giving the sport another chance, after claiming the available last spot by winning a sudden-death playoff.

Before that, Mr Singleton had missed out on a regional qualifying by a single shot - but he was called into the final as an alternate when another player dropped out.

Today, his 30 colleagues will take a day of paid holiday, granted to them by their boss, to cheer on their fellow worker, in the hope he makes the cut and it still around at the weekend.

Mr Singleton said: 'I've got nothing to lose. I've done the 
hard work just getting here and no-one expects anything from me so I'm 
just going to enjoy myself.

The amateur golfer tried his hand at turning professional through the American college system at Rend Lake College, Illinois, where he spent two years.

But his professional dreams were derailed by 
serious injuries to both knees. He was forced to undergo six operations which all-but kept him off the course for three years.

Today, he will be supported by his heavily-pregnant fiancée Lucy Johnson, one of the main drivers behind his second attempt at professional golf.

He said: 'We had a good 
chat about it and she said "I'd like you to give it another try because I
 know it's what you want to do".

'I
 owe her a huge thank you for that and she instilled a lot of belief in 
me to be able to go back and do it and it has paid off. Hopefully we can enjoy the rest of our lives with me as a professional golfer.'

But he also hopes that the excitement won't prove too much and force his partner into an early labour.

He said: 'You never know to be honest with 
you but I'll see how it pans out. I hope she's okay and doesn't get too 
stressed out and worried.

'We'll
 just see how it goes. There are enough friends and family who can shout
 me from the sides if Lucy is going into labour and if that's the case 
I'll take it from there.'

Although he has never played in front of big crowds before, Mr Singleton does have the upper hand over some of the more well-known golfing names.

He said: 'I've got to play the course every day since I qualified and that has been a huge bonus.

'It was hard at first because there weren't many people here and you couldn't soak up the atmosphere.

'Now there are a lot of people here for the practice days so it is exciting to play in front of people.

'I'm going to be nervous but some people are here to watch golf and some are here to watch me so that is nothing to be scared about it.

The sun rose over the clubhouse at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Hoylake, for the first day of the British Open, which will see the world's best golfers compete

'That injury break really helped me. To have those sort of injuries is hard enough but to have two of them I never thought I'd recover but luckily I did.

'It gave me a little bit of perspective in life so I now don't take things too seriously.'

Jonathan Kemp, the firm's managing director, who will be at the course cheering him, told the Telegraph: 'He will have a lot of local support. The Wirral is a small place and a lot of people know he is local.'

And colleague Sean O'Flanagan, the warehouse supervisor, said: 'To us, John is just one of the lads. He does the same work.

'He mixes his resins, he drives the forklift truck around the factory, he just mucks in. He's a very genuine guy.'

A man has been arrested after crashing into a security guard while attempting to drive a golf buggy out of the gates at the Open Championship at Hoylake.

Merseyside Police said a 45-year-old man was arrested following the incident outside Gate Four of the site at Royal Liverpool Golf Club, off Meols Drive.

The security guard received a minor leg injury as the man clipped him before crashing the buggy into a barrier.

Pictures emerged on social media of the buggy, owned by tournament organiser the Royal & Ancient, on a banking outside the gate.

A Merseyside Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm that a man has been arrested following an incident at The Open golf practice day in Hoylake at about 7.30pm this evening.

'The 45-year-old man from Birkenhead was arrested following an incident which involved the taking of a golf buggy on the course.

'One man was arrested on suspicion of assault after the buggy collided with a barrier near to the entrance gate on Meols Road. Just before colliding with the barrier the buggy caught a security guard causing a slight injury to his leg.'

Johnnie Cole-Hamilton, executive director of championships at the R&A, said: 'Police are now investigating and I cannot say any more at this time.'
