A mother would always want to do her best to support her daughter as she gives birth, but Jessica Rotter had a baby of her own to deliver.

Ms Rotter, 35, of Elgin, Illinois, gave birth to a baby boy just six hours before her daughter Briana Guerrero, 17, did so in the same hospital.

Dr Alex Lipowich delivered the boys at Alexian Brothers Medical Center in Elk Grove Village on Tuesday night. Ms Rotter is now a mother of four.

Amazed: Dr Alex Lipowich delivered them at Alexian Brothers Medical Center in Elk Grove Village on Tuesday night and said he had never seen anything like it

‘In 20 years of practising, I’ve seen a lot,’ Dr Alex Lipowich said, adding he had seen mothers and daughters pregnant at the same time.

'But I have never delivered a mother and daughter combination on the same day. I can’t believe that’s very common,'  he told the Chicago Tribune.

The two mothers both gave birth in neighbouring rooms. Ms Guerrero has called her baby Ayden but Ms Rotter’s boy is not yet named.

Ms Guerrero, of Elk Grove Village, began labour on Monday night and gave birth to a 21-inch baby who weighed a whopping 9lbs 9oz.

Mother-of-four: Jessica Rotter gave birth to a 20-inch baby who weighed 7lbs 10oz six hours before her daughter had Ayden in the hospital

She went to hospital with her mother Ms Rotter, who realised by Tuesday afternoon that her baby was also coming - almost three weeks early.

'We were in the room next to each other. I could hear her and she could hear me. She was a trouper, and the doctor said she did a great job'

‘I thought it was sympathy pains at first,’ Ms Rotter told the Chicago Daily Herald. ‘I was crying. I was upset because I couldn’t be with her.

'I think they're going to be really close. And it's nice that they're going to have somebody to be with all the time'

Ms Guerrero and Ayden are now going to move in with Ms Rotter’s mother in Elk Grove Village, reported the Chicago Daily Herald.

‘I won’t get as much time with my grandson,’ Ms Rotter told the Chicago Daily Herald. ‘I’m going to be too busy with my own kid.’

‘I think they're going to be really close,’ Ms Guerrero told WGN of the boys. ‘And it's nice that they're going to have somebody to be with all the time.’
