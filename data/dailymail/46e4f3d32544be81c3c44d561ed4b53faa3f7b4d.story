Her tousled hair scraped behind her ears as she carefully removes lint with a roller from a statuesque model, this is a glimpse at a Victoria Beckham we are hardly familiar with.

Away from the glamour of the red carpets and the elegant image she has so carefully cultivated, Victoria, 39, is the extremely hands-on boss of her global fashion brand.

And she is not afraid to get stuck in as she is seen following a design from its inception to its runway debut on hew new Skype collaboration: Five Years - The Victoria Beckham Fashion Story.

Mum-of-four Victoria admits she faced challenges in becoming recognized in her own right after finding fame as a pop star and marrying David Beckham, becoming one half of one of the world's most famous couples.

'I was a Spice Girl married to a footballer, I was trying to do something that no-one had really done before,' she muses, 'I've always had to work hard for everything.'

But throughout the footage, she's given the blessing of fashion luminaries such as Vogue UK editor Alexandra Shulman, who says: 'I think she has proven herself to have a really successful fashion brand. I don't think there is anybody that would doubt that.'

Shown accepting her designer brand of the year from her friend Marc Jacobs at the 2011 British Fashion Awards, Victoria adds she took inspiration from her mum Jackie, saying: 'I've always loved fashion and I was that kid who used to watch my mum get ready and just think 'wow you look amazing'.

'I always dreamed of designing a collection, it was always my passion.'

Most evenings, she freely admits, are now spent 'curled up in front of Skype speaking with my studio in London - but I wouldn't have it any other way.'

She's shown in her minimalist, all-white studio, with designs and material swatches behind her and globetrotting as she attempts to build her brand.

Victoria Beckham CEO Zach Duane tells the cameras: 'We have now created something that is meaningful and that people are paying attention to. Once you know the story behind anything it's more compelling to connect with.'

On the cover of the February issue of Vanity Fair Italy and Spain, Victoria stresses that she will never sing with the Spice Girls again - after the group reunited for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, saying: 'I won't ever do it again'.

'The Spice Girls were successful because we celebrated women,' she said. 'That's why I do what I want today.'

Indeed, it was the 'perfect time to say, That's great. Thank you to everybody, but no more'.'

'Sometimes you've got to know when it's time to leave the party,' she added.

Right now, she's fully focusing on her fashion brand, which counts fans ranging from Beyoncé to Blake Lively to Kate Winslet.

She has become so influential that this week she was named as one of Britain's 500 most influential people, according to Debrett's, joining Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne and Helen Mirren.

Opening a flagship store in London's Mayfair and offices in Manhattan's Meatpacking district, Victoria will also jet out to NYC for fashion week this week to show off her latest designs.

Last September, her two-year-old daughter Harper stole the show when she was given a plum spot in the front row, being held up by her doting dad - and sitting next to US Vogue editor Anna Wintour.
