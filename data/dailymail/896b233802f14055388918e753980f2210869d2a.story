MS Dhoni has complained bitterly about the 'very hurtful decision' to fine Ravindra Jadeja for his alleged spat with James Anderson during the first Investec Test.

Jadeja was fined 50 per cent of his match fee by the International Cricket Council, a sum in the region of £3,000, over the fracas reported in the Trent Bridge pavilion stairwell.

England fast bowler Anderson will face a more stringent punishment - up to a four-Test ban - if he is found guilty at a hearing on Friday of the Level 3 charge of 'abusing and pushing' Jadeja.

India captain Dhoni has raised the stakes with his recollection of events which - as Jadeja's batting partner, when they made their way off for lunch on day two of the drawn match - is sure to be of interest to ICC judicial commissioner Gordon Lewis.

Dhoni acknowledged, unlike the Board of Control for Cricket in India in a press release on Friday, that no right of appeal is available for the Level 1 judgment against Jadeja.

But he was nonetheless highly critical of the process.

'To me, it is a very hurtful decision,' he said. 'I felt a lot of things were neglected in judging the case.'

Dhoni stopped short of naming Anderson, but was otherwise very specific as he put evidence in the public domain at his press conference on the eve of the third Test in Southampton.

'I would not like to take any other individual name in this,' he said. 'But we started walking and there is an individual who used foul language against Jadeja - and I had to step in the middle and by the time we reached the ropes, I thought the thing had defused.

'By the time we were through the members' area, I was ahead of Jadeja. He was a couple of yards behind me and again something happened.'

Dhoni insists Jadeja was, throughout, an innocent party.

'Something was said to him, and he just turned to the individual - and after that he was pushed, and he barely gained his balance,' said Dhoni.

'He turned to see what is happening. On the basis of that, he is fined. The thing that was told is that it was against the spirit of the game - but what we have to say is that we can't ignore whatever has happened.

'If somebody is saying something to you from behind and you turn and you look, that is not aggressive.'

India will resume the series on Sunday, with a 1-0 lead, harbouring evident grievances over the way Jadeja has been treated.

Dhoni added: 'The bat was under his armpit throughout, right from lunch (being called on the pitch) until he entered the dressing room and not one word was spoken by him.

'I am not lying when it comes to the factual matter. I don't think there was a bit of aggression (from Jadeja) and that is the reason I am very hurt by the wording that has been given. I think it is very important.'

India are frustrated at their inability to appeal against the decision made by match referee David Boon.

'That's the "beauty" of it...you can't really appeal against it,' said Dhoni. 'The BCCI and the leaders are working things out, because we are definitely not at all happy with the wording.

'If we are going into the lobby and we are walking - and if I ask you 'excuse me' and you turn around, that can be an act of aggression from your side - especially if you have anything in your hand. If I push you, or you face me square on, that's an even worse act of aggression.

'Definitely to me, if I am here to judge, I don't think Jadeja committed anything. It also becomes slightly difficult - because tomorrow, if I ask any of my players 'don't say a word, we'll report it to the match referee' whatever happens, we will get fined 50 per cent.

'I am better off abusing the guy or whatever, because 50 per cent of my match money has gone on the other guy abusing me.'
