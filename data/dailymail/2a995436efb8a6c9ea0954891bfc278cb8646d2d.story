Selfies have become perfect means of capturing a cool moment these days.

But it's a risky move when you're posing with a Great White shark.

Dutch conservation photographer Peter Verhoog was diving off the coast of Guadeloupe, Mexico, in September when he took the scary snap.

The 59-year-old, a director at the Dutch Shark Society, had leaned out of the divers' cage to capture a picture of himself with the shark approaching him from behind.

Due to high water temperatures, Mr Verhoog only saw four sharks in three days, including this Great White

But the conservation photographer insists 'people are not prey' for sharks, but can sometimes be in the way

Due to the high water temperatures at the time, Mr Verhoog only saw four sharks in three days during the dive - meaning he had to click the shutter pretty quickly.

He said: 'I began making selfies with all kinds of sharks – mostly for fun.

'Only later I realized that they could show people what sharks are like – when behaving normally, there is no danger.

'People are not a prey for great white sharks – they feed on fish and marine mammals like seals.

'Furthermore, they are careful predators, and sometimes examine people by bumping into them, or taking a bite – the famous 'mistaken identity'.

'Then they let go – we are just not as fat and nourishing as a seal is. But a bite can be fatal.

'We are not on the menu, but we can be in the way.' 

He added he began taking selfies with all types of sharks for fun, but then realised the pictures could teach

'I realized they could show people what sharks are like – when behaving normally, there is no danger,' he said

The shark came pretty close to the divers' cage, but Mr Verhoog says they only eat fish and marine mammals
