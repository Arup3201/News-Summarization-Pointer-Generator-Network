When romantic Jake Dodridge booked a £650 break for himself and his girlfriend, he envisaged the trip as a nice way to break the winter blues.

But he was left heartbroken after long-term partner broke up with him just weeks before the trip was due to start. To make matters worse, lastminute.co.uk refused to give him an 11th-hour refund.

However, to stop the booking going to waste he is now advertising his girlfriend's place on eBay, with bids starting at just 99p.

Jake Dodridge, 21, is looking for a girl willing to go on a four-star holiday to Venice with him after he separated from long-term partner just weeks before the holiday

Mr Dodridge said he was forced to advertise the place on eBay, with bids starting at just 99p, because lastminute.co.uk refused to give him an 11th-hour refund

The package includes flights and a stay at a four-star hotel, but Mr Dodridge is asking for any women to supply a photograph before he agrees to go with them.

In his online advert, the 21-year-old IT technician also states that only women between the ages of 18 and 30 can bid. 

Mr Dodridge, from Newbury, Berkshire, said: 'This isn’t something I would normally do, but when life gives you lemons you have to make lemonade.

'I was upset when my girlfriend dumped me, but looking back it was the right thing to do. It just wasn’t meant to be.

However Mr Dodridge is asking bidders to send him a picture to prove they are female, and is asking only women aged between 18 and 30 to apply

'But what is the point of wasting a perfectly good holiday? I want someone fun to come with me, who is up for a laugh.

'I will obviously get their number before we go so I can chat to them and see if we get on.

'It’s not about making money, I just want someone to go with so the holiday will go to the highest bidder. It will be a great first date.'
