A woman whose mother died of breast cancer is set to wear a different outfit every day for an entire year - with clothes bought from a charity shop.

Caroline Jones, 46, from Harpenden, Herts., hopes to raise money in memory of her mother Mary Benson, 72, who passed away in October.

The grandmother had suffered a long battle with breast cancer but passed away after two years of chemotherapy.

Mary had volunteered in the Cancer Research UK shop in her home town for 13 years.

And now her daughter Caroline has vowed to only where second hand clothes for the whole of 2015 - with a new outfit every day.

The mother-of-three will take daily pictures of her outfits in a bid to rid charity shop clothes of their negative stereotype and inspire others to get involved.

She said: 'Mum was a very stylish woman before and after her cancer. The fashion side of it really helped with keeping her spirits up.

She will take daily pictures of her trendy clothes to dispel any myths about charity shop clothes

'We had a lot of fun together walking about clothes and trying on clothes. Fashion was something that tied us together.

'The reason I started doing this is because I wanted something to focus on this year and I wanted to do something for Cancer Research.

'I also want to get people wearing charity shop clothes and get people away from this stigma that comes with wearing charity shop clothes.

'Obviously there is a massive gap in my life now and I want to fill it with something positive.'

She started 11 days ago and has already raised more than £1,200 - and shown off her great fashion sense

Caroline also volunteers as a window dresser at the shop and has been taking photos since New Year's Day

The mother who also runs a pop-up disco, said she wanted to celebrate her own mother's life 'through the fashion lens'.

She has vowed not to buy anything new for the next 12 months with the only thing that is not charity shop bought being her underwear.

Each bag of clothes donated to a Cancer Research UK shop is potentially worth up to £25

Caroline admits she will wear some items of clothing more than once but promises that every day will see a new outfit.

She added: 'Each bag of clothes donated to a Cancer Research UK shop is potentially worth up to £25 and even more if people sign up for Gift Aid.

'The shop has told me it is already getting new customers who have seen my page.

'People say getting my picture is inspiring them.

'And less than two weeks into her fundraising Caroline has already raised more than £1,200 for Cancer Research UK.

A charity spokesman said: 'Caroline knows more than most the bargains that can be picked up from Cancer Research UK shops and she is encouraging others to visit.

'The shop in Harpenden is one of 570 shops in the UK and helps to fund the charity's ground-breaking work into the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
