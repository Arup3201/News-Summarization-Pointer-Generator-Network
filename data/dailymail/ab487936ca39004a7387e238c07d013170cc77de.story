It's not just the four inches he gives away in height that has Jason Denayer continually looking up to Vincent Kompany.

For any aspiring Belgian centre-half, the Manchester City skipper has long been the industry standard. And, as a team-mate of the player at the Etihad, Denayer knows better than most how high the bar has been set.

Yet, while imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Denayer intends to map out his own career mindful of Kompany’s achievements but not transfixed by them.

Jason Denayer joins in a training exercise with Belgium team-mates Vincent Kompany and Kevin de Bruyne

Denayer tracks Chelsea forward Eden Hazard after he was called up to the Belgium squad for the first time 

‘Vincent is an inspiration to me but I don’t want to be the same as him,’ said the 19-year-old, who stands at 6ft.

‘He is someone I look to but it’s not that I want to be like him. I want to be myself. ‘I admire the way he plays but I don’t want to be a copy of Kompany. I want to be Jason - not Kompany.’

Denayer had plenty of scope to reacquaint himself with the City captain during the international break. Called into Marc Wilmots’ party for the first time for the game with Andorra, the on-loan Celt spent most of the week with his mouth closed and his ears open.

‘Going away with the Belgian national squad was a great experience for me,’ he added.

‘There are so many players from big clubs and it was great to train with them and learn from them. It was good for me. 

The 19-year-old speaks to the assembled media ahead of Thursday night's Europa League clash 

Denayer was all smiles in training as Celtic prepare to face Astra in the Europa League 

‘I was surprised to get the call-up because it was a really big game. ‘A lot of players helped me when I met up with the squad - Adnan Januzaj, Divock Origi and Kompany were three of them. 

‘Vincent spoke to me, made a few jokes with me and the team. It helps that I know the captain of the Belgian team so well. ‘Everybody listens to Vincent. He has the respect of everyone in the country. 

‘He gives me a lot of advice but mainly, just to be myself and everything will be okay.’

If Kompany’s advice had included that Denayer targets a push for a first-team slot at City next season, then he was wasting his breath.

For all the year’s loan to Celtic is proving invaluable in terms of exposure to first-team football, his heart remains with the English champions.

‘I watched Manchester City play in the Champions League on Tuesday night and I want to be back there next season,’ he stated.

‘But I don’t think about this too much. I prefer to think about the present at Celtic. I want to do well enough here to maybe play there.

‘The loan move has already helped me a lot. I have played first-team football and been called up to the national team.

‘Being at Celtic has given me what I didn’t have at City. Reserve-team football at Man City is good but it’s not the same as playing for a first-team.

‘In Under 21 football, you play against young opponents. At Celtic, I am playing against men. But I still want to go back to England after my loan and try to be a success. That is my priority.’

Before those Champions League ambitions can be realised with his parent club, the rather more mundane matter of the Europa League with Celtic comes into view tonight.

Denayer is not alone when he states honestly that he could ink his knowledge of the Romanians on the back of a postage stamp. Yet he’s acutely aware of the significance of taking six points from them over the coming two matches. 

‘I don’t know a lot about Astra. Just that they come from Romania,’ he said. ‘It’s very important to win this game. Salzburg are playing against Zagreb and we hope that will be a draw.

‘That would give us a better chance to finish first if we beat Astra. ‘I think we can beat them and give ourselves a chance to qualify for the knockout stages of the Europa League.’

A victory tonight wouldn’t just put Celtic in the box seat for qualification. It would be a much-needed endorsement of Ronny Deila’s regime.

Denayer’s partnership with Virgil van Dijk has been one of the few certainties upon which the Norwegian has been able to hang his hit thus far and the Belgian foresees that developing further throughout his season in Glasgow.

‘Virgil is great to play beside,’ he added. ‘He is a very good player and he is relaxed when he speaks to you.

‘How good is he? He can be a very good player. I expect him to play at a high level in England one day. 

‘How high? The highest. Playing beside Virgil and Vincent helps my game. They are very good players and speak to me. ‘If I make a mistake, Virgil is there for me. He is good.’
