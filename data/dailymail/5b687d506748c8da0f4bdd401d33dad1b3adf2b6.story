The new boss of Network Rail has apologised to passengers for poor performance that has left the firm facing fines of up to £80million for missing punctuality targets.

Mark Carne accepted that the company ‘must do better’ but pledged to make Britain’s trains the most punctual in Europe as part of his £38billion ‘five year plan’ which begins tomorrow.

The former oil boss vowed to reduce overcrowding, free up the timetable, increase punctuality and reliability, and make the railways safer – while cutting costs by 20 per cent.

But he said: ‘I hold my hand up and agree that more than 50 per cent of delays are to do with failures of the network.

'We have to work on reliability so that there are fewer failures to the system. I want to get people there on time.

'Reliability is absolutely critical to the job I have to do.’

He also signalled that directors’ bonus payments are to be cut in favour of bigger basic salaries – a move which would in fact favour them if they miss future targets on which bonuses would be based.

Mr Carne, a 54-year-old Cornishman, took over the role of chief executive last month after Sir David Higgins left to run HS2.

Network Rail is on track to be fined up to £80million by the Office of Rail Regulation due to its failure to meet key targets over the last five years.

The company is to blame for more than half of the delays on the railways. Just 86.5 per cent of long-distance trains are punctual – way below the target of 91.8 per cent.

The rail watchdog imposes a penalty for every 0.1 per cent failure to meet punctuality targets on long distance routes. However, it may take account of mitigating factors such as the recent severe weather and flooding, which led to widespread chaos and cancellations.

Meanwhile, Network Rail has confirmed that the storm-wrecked railway line at Dawlish in Devon will reopen as planned at the end of the week

Mr Carne has pledged to transform Britain’s railways with ‘more trains, more seats, reduced congestion and bigger, better stations’.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ‘A key part of this Government’s long-term economic plan is investing in world-class infrastructure.

'That is why we are putting record amounts of Government funding into our railways over the next five years.

‘That investment will generate growth, create jobs and boost business while delivering faster journeys, greater comfort and better punctuality for passengers across the UK.’

A spokesman for consumer watchdog Passenger Focus said: ‘The £38billion investment for Network Rail over the next five years is welcome, particularly during difficult economic times.’

But it warned: ‘Passengers should ultimately see an improved rail service bringing the things they tell us they want – improved punctuality, reliable trains with more seats.’

The coast-hugging stretch of  track was severely damaged in this winter's savage storms. It then suffered more damage in another violent storm on February 14

Meanwhile, Network Rail has confirmed that the storm-wrecked railway line at Dawlish in Devon will reopen as planned at the end of the week. The coast-hugging stretch of  track was severely damaged in this winter’s savage storms. It then suffered more damage in another violent storm on February 14.

The line was shut and work carried out around the clock to bring it back into service. But the planned re-opening was threatened early this month by a massive landslip, involving the collapse of 20,000 tonnes of cliff-face near Teignmouth.

Confirming that the reopening  was going ahead, Mr Carne said: ‘Dawlish has shown us at our best when we work in a planned, disciplined and innovative way.’
