Abandoning her trademark barefaced and boho chic look, Georgia May Jagger is transformed into a femme fatale for her latest ad.

The 22-year-old stars in the new Rimmel London Wonder’full Mascara campaign as a glamorous but unwelcome guest at a smart society party.

The British model smoulders in a racy leather and lace black ensemble and as might be expected from the daughter of
 Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger and supermodel Jerry Hall,
 oozes effortless cool in the campaign.

The advert sees her as the dangerous guest at a swanky London party dressed in a sheer black blouse and cropped black leather trousers.

With her hair in waves, Georgia is seen on CCTV breaking into a room before smashing the case surrounding the Wonder’Full Mascara with her pendant necklace.

Descending the grand staircase with her stolen prize, she pauses to apply the mascara, before seducing every man she passes as she leaves the party. 

Speeding away in a getaway car, Georgia utters the brand’s trademark phrase, made famous by fellow Rimmel model Kate Moss: ‘Get the London Look’.

Georgia's face is a regular fixture in magazine and fashion campaigns while long-term boyfriend, and fellow model, Josh McLennan models for Topman in the UK.

As well as her new position as the face of Rimmel’s mascara, Georgia also shot Sunglasses Hut's 94 Shades Of Summer campaign a few weeks ago, a brand for which she  famously modelled alongside mother Jerry Hall, and is the face of Reserved Autumn/Winter 2014/2015 clothing line.
