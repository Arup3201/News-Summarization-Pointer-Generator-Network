Dozens of demonstrators were arrested, while the leader of the protests was put on a plane to the country's second city Chittagong and the deputy chief was detained in the capital.

Police said they used sound grenades, water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse at least 70,000 Islamists who were camped at Dhaka's Motijheel Commercial Area as part of a push for a blasphemy law.

Activists from the fundamentalist 
Hefajat-e-Islam group had marched along at least six roads, blocking 
transport between Dhaka and other cities.

Witnesses have said the group was 
chanting 'Allahu Akbar!' ('God is greatest!') and 'One point, One 
demand: Atheists must be hanged.'

Police have said about 200,000 people 
marched to central Dhaka, where tensions erupted as protesters - armed 
with rocks - clashed with security officials, who beat them back with 
batons.

'We were forced to act after they unlawfully continued their gathering at Motijheel. They attacked us with bricks, stones, rods and bamboo sticks,' Dhaka police spokesman Masudur Rahman said, adding protesters dispersed early Monday, he added.

Staff at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, confirmed that 11 bodies were brought to the clinic, including a policeman who had been hacked in the head with machetes.

A further 26Â  were killed in the protests, including eight people killed in the Kanchpur district on the outskirts of Dhaka.

It is believed rioting broke out after
police tried to intercept protesters, many of whom had travelled from 
remote villages and had gathered in front of the country's largest 
mosque.

Trouble then spread to central districts of Dhaka, according to reports.

Six are said to have bullet wounds in 
their heads. Police maintain that only rubber bullets were used, but 
witnesses and various local media sources claim officers fired hundreds 
of live rounds.

Violence also flared up at Hathazari,
a town just outside Chittagong, where local police chief Liaqot Ali 
said at least five people were killed after several thousand Islamists 
clashed with police and border guards.

Police also shut down two pro-Islamist television stations 
which broadcast footage of the raid on Motijheel, who had their offices raided by civil police on Monday.

Police try to detain an activist of Hefajat-e-Islam: The newly created radical Islamist group wants greater segregation of men and women, and a stricter Islamic education

The protests had been instigated by Allama Shah Ahmad Shafi, the leader of Hefajat-e-Islam who is said to be around 90 years old.

Police said he was put on a plane to the country's second city Chittagong and the deputy chief was detained in the capital.

Hefajat-e-Islam is a newly created 
radical Islamist group that wants greater segregation of men and women, 
and a stricter Islamic education. It also want the restoration of pledges to Allah in the constitution.

The government in Bangladesh has 
rejected the groups' demands, saying the Muslim-majority nation is 
governed by secular liberal laws.

Leaders have threatened to launch a campaign to oust the government unless their demands are met.
