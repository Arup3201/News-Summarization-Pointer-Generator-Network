These are the terrifying moments a climber loses his grip and plummets 100ft down the side of a Welsh mountain.

Mark Roberts was scaling a gully in Snowdonia last month when a block of ice fell from above him.

The footage, captured by his helmet camera and giving the viewer a glimpse of Roberts's point of view, shows him putting up his arm before his fall begins.

A falling block of ice led to mountaineer Mark Roberts taking a terrifying plunge down a Welsh mountainside

It took thirty seconds for Roberts to be able to halt on a ledge

The fall happened so quickly that Mark Roberts lost control and could not 'self-arrest'

For 30 seconds, Roberts is seen plunging from the Parsley Fern Gully at Cwm Glas.

He hits rocks and flips over as he tumbles from his spot and loses his axes.

After coming to a halt on a ledge, Roberts takes a few moments to catch his breath before - understandably - uttering: 'That f****** hurt.'

Roberts was rescued by the Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team within half an hour of his fall on February 24 and came away with a twisted ankle and bruises after being airlifted by an RAF search and rescue team from 22 Squadron on Anglesey, the same team that Prince William serves on.

He told the British Mountaineering Council's website that the steep slope meant he did not have enough time to 'self arrest' - to stop his fall himself - before starting to bounce.

The British Mountaineering Council's Elfyn Jones, who was part of the rescue team, told The Next Web: 'I think the key message here is that accidents do happen, but that Mark was well equipped, wearing a helmet, and that probably saved his life.'
