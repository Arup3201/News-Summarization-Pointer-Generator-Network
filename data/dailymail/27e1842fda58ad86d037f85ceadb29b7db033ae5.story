A British businessman sentenced to six months in a Dubai jail for pinching a woman's bottom in a bar has won his appeal - but says his life is in tatters after spending every penny fighting to clear his name.

Married expatriate Steven Sherriff, 45, escaped serving time behind bars but says he has been financially ruined by his nine-month ordeal and humiliated after being branded a sex attacker.

He plans to sue his accuser, a 23-year-old Brit who claimed he groped her left buttock and slipped his hand between her legs.

And he said the last nine months have been 'hell' for him and his wife Betina after the cost of legal bills and lost earnings amounted to £70,000.

Mr Sherriff, an investor who sells airplane paint, said: 'I don't know if I can face staying in Dubai after this. Of course I'm relieved to have won my appeal but we have been financially ruined.

'I haven't been able to work while this has been ongoing and they took my passport away. Overnight my earnings of £7,000 a month went down the drain and we had to spend another £3,500 on legal fees.

'I lost an airplane contract worth millions because I was not allowed to work.

'Betina has been in bits, especially after hearing all the terrible things I was accused of, none of which I would ever do.

'I am going to be taking legal action against the people who tried to put me behind bars. I have lost nine months of my life because of their drunken stupidity.'

Belfast-born Mr Sherriff, who has lived in Dubai for seven years and been married for 15 years, had been on a bar crawl with six friends on February 24.

He and one of the group ended up in Nelsons bar in the Media Rotana hotel at 11pm, where he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman standing at the bar, a clerk with a recruitment company.

She was out with her 27-year-old boyfriend and a friend and complained she had felt someone groping her between her legs - although she admitted she did not see who did it and her own friend claimed Mr Sherriff was innocent.

Mr Sherriff said: 'She insisted it was me because she turned around and I was standing there. It is sickening. I know myself and I would never do that.'

The woman's boyfriend knocked him unconscious after she claimed he had groped her. Both men were arrested and Mr Sherriff said although they mutually agreed to drop charges against each other, the boyfriend went back on his word and he was charged with the sex attack.

They were each fined £170 for drinking alcohol, a crime in the Islamic country, and in July Mr Sherriff was sentenced to six months behind bars for the sexual assault.

He immediately appealed and was on bail while fighting his case, although his passport was taken away and he was prevented from visiting Betina, who works in a nursing home in Copenhagen in her native Denmark.

Mr Sherriff was only cleared when three bouncers from the bar, who refused to give evidence at the original trial, were ordered by judges to appear before Dubai's Court of Appeal and admitted they did not see a sex attack taking place.

Even though he has proved his innocence, his accuser cannot be identified because she is protected by the same law which prevented the victim of rapist footballer Ched Evans from being named.

Under British law, she can only be named if she is proven to have lied to police and prosecutors. Mr Sherriff thinks she refused to change her story because she was afraid of ending up behind bars herself.

He said: 'I have lost nine months of my life because of her and her boyfriend's drunken stupidity.

'At any point, they could have called the whole thing off but they didn't. Brits in Dubai need to know if they come here, they need to respect the law, not use it to their advantage against innocent people.

'I know the rules here and have always respected them.

'I will be seeking legal action against them. They can't get away with lying like this. This has been a living nightmare.'
