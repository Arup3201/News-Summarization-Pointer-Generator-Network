Jason Hakala is a video specialist, so his marriage proposal was probably always going to be a recording.

The Seattle man works for The Cut, who this week hit headlines for producing a hilarious video of some grandmothers who smoked weed together for the first time.

But Hakala has now gone viral on his own, after filming a grand marriage proposal to his longtime girlfriend, Stella Yee.

He sent a helium-filled weather balloon with his phone and and a GoPro camera attached to it 90,000 feet in the air, and the camera captured his phone playing a pre-recorded message from space.

Mission accomplished: Video producer Jason Hakala cheers after landing a balloon he sent 90,000 feet in the air, which he used to propose to his girlfriend 

Big project: Hakala attached a PVC pipe to the balloon that had a GoPro camera, his phone and a GPS tracker strapped onto it

Major effort: The GoPro camera recorded Hakala's phone, which played a video of him asking the big question

The moment: The following day took his girlfriend, Stella, and her family on a hike, and then played the video he had made

Popping the question: This is the video of Hakala proposing from 90,000 feet in the air

Will you?: An emotional Stella ofcourse accepted the proposal

Overwhelmed: Stella said the best part was knowing how much effort Hakala had gone to 

The ring: Stella proudly shows off her engagement ring

That message reduced Stella to tears, and many others as well now after the video was posted to YouTube.

In it Hakala says: 'Hey babe. The time has finally come. It took me a trip to space to finally get the balls to do this. But I love you so much and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me, Stella Yee?'

And she ofcourse said yes.

Hakala told The Huffington Post that he made the balloon using a PVC pipe and attached a GPS so he and his friends could track where it landed.

They launched it from a field three hours east of Seattle.

The next day Hakala took his girlfriend - who he first met in high school - and her family on a hike in Verlot, Washington.

After reaching the summit they aimed to conquer, he played the space video in front of everyone.

The proposal took place in 2012, but Hakala only just uploaded the video online.

The couple were married in Hawaii and now hey married in Hawaii and now have a 13-month-old daughter named Suvi.
