An eight-year-old girl has envisioned all her mother's favorite TV shows with some very creative doodles.

San Francisco-based blogger Sunny Chanel says her daughter has never watched Mad Men or Girls, but that didn't stop her from drawing colorful sketches that portray a surprisingly realistic albeit adorably simplistic view of the shows.

In her drawing of Downton Abbey, for instance, three women with old-fashioned hairstyles, long gowns and white gloves stand in a row - presumably Edith, Mary and Sybil.

Child's point of view: Blogger Sunny Chanel has shared the doodles her eight-year-old daughter created as artistic interpretations of her mom's favorite TV shows - including Orange is the New Black (pictured)

Simple explanations: The little girl (pictured), whose name is not revealed, also explained to her mom what she believed each of the TV shows is about

She told her mother that she believes the show is about 'people who live in a great big castle in London, and they have lots of parties and spend a lot of money on really pretty clothes.'

Sunny writes on Mom.me that she discovered her daughter's talent for artistic interpretations when she said to her one day: 'Mommy, I'm gonna draw you a picture, okay?'

She returned ten minutes later with a sketch of Piper Chapman from Orange is the New Black. 

'Before you call child services, I should mention that my third-grader has never watched even a second of Netflix's most popular show,' writes Sunny.

Family time: Sunny (pictured with her daughter) says her daughter has never watched any of the shows, but she is aware of them through advertising and conversation

Twenty-somethings: The little girl's interpretation of Girls is a simple drawing of four brunettes standing in a row, with somewhat bored expressions on their faces

'She must have seen an ad on the side of a bus or a billboard off the freeway. Orange just happens to be her favorite color (this month, that is). Apparently, it made an impression.'

So she asked her daughter to do more sketches, as well as offering explanations for the plots of each one.

For Orange is the New Black, the little girl said: 'It's about ladies who are in jail. It looks like it would be serious, even though they are wearing such a happy orange.' 

The young girl's Walking Dead doodle accurately captures its fright factor, with blood pouring out one character's body.

'This show is all about the zombie apocalypse,' she explains. 'It's a scary show, duh! Zombies are never fun.'

And her interpretation of Girls is a simple drawing of four brunettes standing in a row, with somewhat bored expressions on their faces. 

'This is about four BFFs who like to hang out, and they go shopping a lot,' explains Sunny's daughter. 'They argue about who gets to buy what, but sometimes they share clothes.'

The little girl also did drawings for Mad Men (a man in a suit), Game of Thrones (Daenerys Targaryen) and Scandal (Olivia Pope in a white jacket).
