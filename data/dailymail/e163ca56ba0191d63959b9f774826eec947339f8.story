When Project Runway All Stars' four remaining designers were tasked with dressing four female military veterans from the Army, Marines, Air Force, and Navy, they rose to the challenge.

And so did the models. Leslie Nicole Smith, a U.S. Army veteran amputee with a
prosthetic leg, walked the catwalk proudly in dress designer Joshua McKinley had made for her to wear to a military ball.

Proud of her service and her survival story, Ms Smith showed off her legs in five-inch heels and a short-sleeved little black dress, the hem of which grazed the top of her knees.

The designers were asked to make special 
occasion dresses for the veterans, including a wedding, a military ball, a bachelorette party in Las Vegas, and a fortieth 
birthday party, where they would then judged by Carmen Marc Valvo and Katie Holmes.

Previously, in similar Project Runway challenges, the designers have complained about having to 
design for 'real women,'Â  but the four guests appeared to receive ample care and attention.

And Leslie's designer, Mr McKinley, seemed particularly inspired because his brother is a soldier in Afghanistan.

'Meeting with Leslie definitely hits close to home with me,' he said.

The the pair first met, Leslie revealed how she lost her leg 'two weeks before the end of my first deployment,' she said.

'I developed a blood clot in my leg, I was taken to the army hospital on imminent death status, with 24-hours to live.

Episode winner: Mr McKinley used leopard print fabric at Leslie's request, dying it a muted green and using it sparingly as trim - he also made a matching outfit for her service dog

'When they amputated below the knee, the
first thought I had was "am I going to be able to wear high heels?"' 
she admitted through tears.

Mr McKinley bought a bold leopard print 
fabric at Leslie's request, but used it with elegant restraint, dying it
a muted green and using it sparingly as trim. He also made a matching 
outfit for her service dog.

After Leslie had walked the runway smiling, designer judge Carmen Marc Valvo ask her if she actually wanted to wear an outfit to her military ball which revealed so much of her prosthetic leg. 'Absolutely,' she responded.

Ms Holmes loved the dress, commenting: 'I think it's a beautiful, beautiful dress. What I love about this is that it just feels very comfortable, and very you. I love it.'
