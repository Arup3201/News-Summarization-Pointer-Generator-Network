A prototype app for the iPhone allows users to turn any tabletop into a keyboard.

The Vibrative Virtual Keyboard uses the iPhone 4's built-in accelerometer to read the vibrations as fingers tap a surface to work out which 'key' is being pressed.

By analysing the strength and frequency of tremors through the surface the phone is resting on, the software works out the approximate location of the strike on a virtual QWERTY keyboard.

Good vibes: A student at Goldsmiths has developed an iPhone app which uses the gadget's built-in accelerometer to interpret taps on a tabletop as strikes on a full-size keyboard

The app has been developed by Swiss designer Florian Kräutli for his one-year cognitive computing master's degree at Goldsmiths, University of London.

'Touch screen devices, such as smartphones, lack a suitable method for text input which can compete with mechanical keyboards,' Mr Kräutli said.

'The Vibrative Virtual Keyboard aims to appease the frustration felt by smartphone users when faced with drafting lengthy emails or notes on a small onscreen keyboard.

'The keyboard requires no additional hardware as it taps into an iPhone's built-in accelerometer, which is able to measure the vibrations caused by typing on any hard surface.'

A French entrepreneur is marketing carved wooden keyboards created from maple and walnut trees from the Alps.

Mixing one of man's oldest materials with modern technology, each keyboard is wireless, using Bluetooth to connect to PCs and tablets.

Julien Salanave said his work is an attempt to stop the 'impersonal, lifeless aesthetic' that came in with the computer.

The software needs to be trained to interpret the tremors typing fingers produce on the particular surface used.

After collecting examples of all the keys on the keyboard, it compares new data to this training data to roughly work out which key have been pressed.

So far Mr Kräutli has been able to reach an 80 per cent accuracy using the system, so errors occur the software will 'assume' what the user intended to write using an auto-correct dictionary.

Mr Kräutli, who created the system as part of studies into user interfaces, told the Telegraph: 'The signals I’m collecting are very weak.

'At the moment it’s more of a proof of concept but if you made the accelerometer more sensitive you could improve the accuracy quite easily.'

The technology has been designed for iPhone 4, but Mr Kräutli was forced to use a 'jailbroken' device as Apple does not allow apps to change the way that its iOS keyboard works.

He says the software could easily be developed for other operating systems or devices which use accelerometers, however.

Demonstrating the technology in a video, Mr Kräutli uses a piece of paper printed with an image of a keyboard to train the software and then type out a text message.

Showing how it could be used by a touch-typist, he then takes away the paper and continues to type directly on the wooden surface.
