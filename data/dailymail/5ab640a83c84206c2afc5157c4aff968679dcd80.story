You may not have heard of him yet, but sixteen-year-old Tiuri is set to be the next Harry Potter. 

Tiuri is the hero of a children’s story, The Letter For The King, which is published in a new, illustrated edition this week.

He is already famous around the world — but it took more than five decades for his adventures to be translated into English.

The book, by Tonke Dragt, was first published in Holland in 1962, translated into 15 languages and sold over a million copies worldwide. 

But it had never been translated into English.

Now, a big-budget TV adaptation is in the pipeline and the sequel, Secrets Of The Wild Woods, is being translated.

Publisher Adam Freudenheim knew he was onto a hit when he caught his son stealing pages of the book from his desk in the middle of the night.

The plot sees Tiuri contemplating if he is to be knighted the next day while locked in a chapel.

The book is already drawing comparisons to the highly popular Harry Potter series, which was also given a big screen adaptation 

He then hears a knock at the door asking for help and he is asked to deliver a letter to King Unauwen across the Great Mountains.

On his way he encounters evil and must keep his true identity a secret as well as the contents of the letter.

The Letter For The King is published by Pushkin Children’s Books at £7.99.
