A man suspended from a Detroit-area university after writing about his attraction to teachers in a class journal sued the school Friday for $2.2 million and four lost credits, claiming his free-speech rights were violated.

Joseph Corlett, 57, a home builder who enrolled in college because of the weak economy, said he was an A-student in a writing class at Oakland University in Rochester until he submitted a journal in 2011 titled 'Hot For Teacher,' the name of a song by the rock band Van Halen.

Corlett compared his female instructor to Ginger, a sultry movie starlet character on the 1960s TV show 'Gilligan's Island.'

Angry: Joseph Corlett, 56, is fuming after Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, kicked him off the writing and rhetoric course and the campus

He feared being distracted and said, 'I'll never learn a thing.' He said another teacher who was pregnant was 'hot, and not just from baking the bun in her oven.'

The teacher informed an Oakland dean after reading the journal for the first time. Officials said Corlett's writings violated a policy against intimidation or harassment and last year barred him for three terms, through winter 2013.

The university said he must undergo counseling if he wants to return as a student.

In an interview, Corlett, who now lives in Sarasota, Florida, said he's fighting for his civil rights.

‘When you get past the titillation, you've got to look into what's really going on here,’ he said. ‘It's academic freedom or no academic freedom. We're all collectively dumbed when speech is suppressed or challenged.’

Oakland spokesman David Groves said the school doesn't comment on lawsuits.

Corlett said students in the English 380 class were told to write ‘raw things, a personal diary that maybe we wouldn't want anyone to read.’ He said the teacher had no objection to his earlier work, which earned an A, an essay about accidentally seeing women's breasts.

‘There is no constitutional protection against being offended,’ Corlett said. ‘And while I am sympathetic to anyone's feelings, I repeatedly asked for instruction. I was repeatedly told there were no topics that were out of bounds.’

Corlett was removed from the writing class by two police officers after an Oakland administrator forgot to tell him that he was barred from attending while his status as a student was under review.

Attorney Alari Adams said Corlett is seeking $2.2 million for mental anguish and the embarrassment of being kicked out of school.

Corlett enrolled full-time at Oakland in 2011 after earning an associate degree from Oakland Community College. He said he needs 40 credit hours for a bachelor's degree.

‘The real issue is the First Amendment,’ Mr Corlett previously said. ‘It's about academic freedom and about due process.

‘I asked her on multiple occasions if there were topical restrictions on the day books - and on every occasion she told me no,’ he told ABC News.

His case was taken up by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education after he was banned from campus and told to undergo counseling.

The journal in which he wrote the piece was labelled as a ‘place for a writer to try out ideas and record impressions and observations’.

The idea was that uncensored writings and
thoughts in the journal, which he handed in November, could be used to 
create proper essays.

He compared one teacher in another entry to Ginger Grant, a character played by actress Tina Louise in 1960s TV comedy series Gilligan's Island.

Mr Corlett met with university officials in December and they allegedly told him last month he would be arrested if he set foot on the campus.

He was found guilty of intimidation by university officials at a hearing but a sexual harassment charge was dropped, reported ABC News.

They added that he was suspended for three semesters and must go through sensitivity counselling if he wishes to reapply next winter.

His wife Lynn has supported him during his appeal to the decision and his lawyers say he has been treated like a ‘student with a mental disability’.

Ms Mitzelfeld told university officials that she would leave if they did not ban Mr Corlett from campus, reported the Huffington Post.

She also claimed she was concerned he might be carrying a gun in her classrooms after he allegedly wrote about his support for carrying concealed weapons in previous work.

This can be seen in a detailed letter he wrote to the Oakland Post student paper in January 2010, showing a strong understanding of the subject.

Compared: Hot for Teacher by Van Halen, pictured, was a sexually suggestive song from the U.S. band, which became famous for its bizarre video

‘This is a wild overreaction to a student's creative writing,’ FIRE President Greg Lukianoff, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said.

‘The university has essentially issued a straightjacket to every writing student to protect the delicate sensibilities of faculty and staff.’

Oakland University Writing Center director Sherry Wynn Perdue told the Huffington Post that Mr Corlett had ‘victimised’ Ms Mitzelfeld.

Hot for Teacher by Van Halen was a sexually suggestive song from the U.S. band's album 1984, which courted controversy with its bizarre video.
