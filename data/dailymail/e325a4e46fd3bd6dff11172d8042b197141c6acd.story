Six Iranians have been given life sentences in Dubai for the kidnap of a British businessman who is now feared dead.

Abbas Yazdi, 44, who was snatched from the car park of his general trading company in Dubai in June 2013, fell victim to Iranian intelligence officers, his wife Atena claims.

She believes he was taken to Iran and murdered because of testimony he had given to an international arbitration tribunal in The Hague. His body has never been found.

Iran has denied any role in Yazdi's disappearance.

Prosecutors in Dubai said the defendants attacked and
drugged Yazdi and smuggled him out of the country to Iran
through a port in the UAE emirate of Sharjah.

The Gulf News identified the three who stood trial as R.A.
aged 32, K.G, 52, and N.A. 55, who all denied the
charges of kidnap, assault and theft.'R.A.' admitted he
had driven the car used in the abduction, the newspaper said.

It identified the three convicted in absentia as H.B., B.N. and I.N. A further defendant, identified as S.H., who had planned the kidnapping, had died in custody.  

An Iranian opposition figure in London said Mr Yazdi was kidnapped to gather evidence against Mehdi Hashemi Rafsanjani, a childhood friend.

Mr Rafsanjani, the son of a former leader, was charged with inciting unrest after the re-election in 2009 of then president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Media reports said that father-of-two Yazdi was giving evidence by video link to an
international arbitration tribunal in The Hague intended to
settle a long-running commercial dispute involving United Arab
Emirates-based Crescent Petroleum and the National Iranian Oil
Company.

There is no evidence to suggest that this involvement in the
arbitration is connected to his disappearance, reports have said.
