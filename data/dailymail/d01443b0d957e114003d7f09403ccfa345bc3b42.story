A teenage sex attacker who robbed a woman while she walked home late at night wrote a five-point checklist reminding himself how to commit crime.

Zach Jackson, then 18, 
slapped his 19-year-old victim before sexually assaulting her and grabbing her 
phone in Blackpool, Lancashire.

The victim’s father used a tracking app to help police trace the phone to Jackson's home - and when officers searched his house, they found the chilling bullet-point instructions in a notebook.

Jailed: Zach Jackson, 19, wrote a checklist (right) before sexually assaulting a young woman

The list read: 'Wear black clothes', 'Gloves', 'Warm up before doing it', 'Watch out for CCTV', and then, finally: 'Grab'.

Roger
 Brown, prosecuting at Preston Crown Court, said the victim had been out
 drinking with friends in Blackpool in December and tried to phone her 
father for a lift, but wasn’t able to contact him.

She described seeing a male stood on the corner, tucked into the doorway of a house and on a phone.

The court heard that during the incident, Jackson slapped her so hard that he caused her to fall to her knees.

She had her mobile phone in her right hand and her bag in her left hand.

The defendant then bent over, put his hand under her clothing and sexually assaulted her, the court was told, before grabbing her mobile phone and running up the street.

Jackson, now 19 and from Blackpool, pleaded guilty to robbery and sexual assault.

He
 also admitted attempting to possess cocaine with intent to supply in 
connection to a drug offence on Merseyside in July 
last year.

Rachel Woods, 
defending, said the list found at Jackson's address did not indicate he had 
been planning a sex assault - but could indicate the idea of a 
robbery.

Preston Crown Court, pictured, heard Jackson had targeted a vulnerable victim and jailed him for three years

'He did not seek out the female,' Ms Woods said.

'There is no evidence to suggest he had been stalking or following her.

'She had asked him for a cigarette. What happened was opportunistic.

'She had one of the latest iPhones and he had taken a fancy to it. He went on to sexually assault her.'

She added: 'His guilty pleas have spared the young woman from having to come to court to give evidence about the matter.'

But while saying the attacker's remorse was 'genuine', Judge Anthony Russell QC jailed him for three years and placed him on the sex offenders' register indefinitely.

'You specifically targeted a vulnerable victim,' the judge added.
