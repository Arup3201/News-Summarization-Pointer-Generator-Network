New European featherweight champion Josh Warrington can match Ricky Hatton's level of popularity as his career gathers pace, according to promoter Eddie Hearn.

Warrington continued his rise to prominence in his home city of Leeds by stopping Davide Dieli in the fourth round to add the European title to his British and Commonwealth straps.

Arguably more impressive than his performance was the raucous reception afforded to the 23-year-old at the First Direct Arena, which took even Hearn by surprise.

The promoter is convinced his young charge can capture the imagination of the city - as former two-weight world champion Hatton did in Manchester during his career.

'We've got something major here,' said Hearn, who revealed beforehand that Warrington had personally sold close to 2,000 tickets himself.

'I've not seen anything like that. Belfast and Glasgow are wonderful cities but you don't see a thousand people taking their shirts off and swinging them over their heads.

'This is the kind of support Ricky Hatton had back in those days, it's fanatical. It's not just 'let's go to Leeds and watch some boxing'. It's about one person, it's about Josh Warrington, it's a fanatical support and that means so much to someone's career.'

Hearn said he was impressed with Warrington's relationship with the crowd, comparing him to Hatton

It has been a whirlwind 12 months for Warrington, who gained his first stoppage win as a professional in his 16th fight against Samir Mouneimne in November last year to capture the Commonwealth title before winning the British title by outpointing Martin Lindsay in Leeds in May.

And following his latest triumph, Warrington (19-0, 3KOs) said: 'I couldn't really predict what would have happened 12 months ago. It's been a real rollercoaster ride.

'Picking up the Commonwealth, British and now European (titles) has been unbelievable but I'm loving every minute of it.'

Warrington started strongly on Saturday night and gained reward for outworking his foe when a straight right put down Dieli in the fourth round before a barrage immediately after prompted the referee to halt the contest.

'I kept my gameplan until I knocked him down and after that it went out of the window. I smelt blood and went for him. There was no stopping those arms from going,' Warrington added.

On the undercard, Ricky Burns made a winning start on his light-welterweight debut but was thoroughly uninspiring in a points win over lightly regarded Frenchman Alexandre Lepelley.

The former two-weight world champion would have been hoping to make his mark in the 140lbs division after back-to-back defeats at lightweight and although the Scot put his French opponent down in the first round he largely struggled thereafter.

The 23-year-old Warrington's record is now an impressive 19-0 with three knockouts 

The 31-year-old Coatbridge fighter recorded his 37th win from 42 bouts in the eight-round contest but may now move back down to lightweight.

Brian Rose bounced back from his world title setback with a first-round stoppage against Ignacio Lucero Fraga.

The Blackpool fighter, who was beaten by WBO light-middleweight champion Demetrius Andrade earlier this year, floored his Argentinian opponent three times for a confidence-boosting victory.

Hot prospect Callum Smith continued his rise up the ranks by claiming the 14th win of his professional career with a third-round TKO of Rafael Sosa Pintos.
