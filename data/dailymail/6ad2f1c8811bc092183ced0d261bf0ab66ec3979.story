Six sandwiches in one hour: Jerome Davis became enraged when his brother questioned his eating habits and pulled a knife on him

An Iowa man pulled a knife on his brother as they fought
over peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

Jerome Davis, 51, of Des Moines, became enraged Friday after his brother
criticized him for making and eating six sandwiches in an hour, so he pulled a
knife on him.

Mr Davis has a handful of drug-related criminal convictions
dating back over 20 years that include multiple jail sentences, records showed.

Authorities did not name Mr Davis’ brother, also in his 50s,
in an arrest report obtained by the Des Moines Register which details the
altercation.

Mr Davis ‘made three peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and ate them in
the living room,’ the report said. ‘Within the next hour, the suspect made
another 3 of these peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.’

This brought ‘his total consumption of peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches to six. This angered the victim,’ the report continued.

Confronted with being called an over-eater, Mr Davis escalated
the situation.

‘Both victim and suspect began yelling about the other being
lazy and ‘eating again,’ the report said.

Mr Davis then pulled out a knife, held it to his brother’s face
and threatened to cut him, according to the report.

Police confiscated two knives from the scene and arrested the
violent man as he told them he became violent because his brother wouldn’t ‘shut
the f**k up and mind his own business.’

This is not Mr Davis’ first run-in with the law. He has three
drug-related convictions, as well as another for criminal trespass.

He has served at least a combined 14 days in jail for the
convictions.

The ex-con was charged with domestic assault with a weapon and
hauled back to jail pending trial.
