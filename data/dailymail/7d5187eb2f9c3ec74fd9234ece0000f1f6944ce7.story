A few days ago, the first reviews began to trickle in for the comedy The Interview, which depicts a shambolic attempt to assassinate the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.

Unfortunately, they were less than enthusiastic. One critic called it a ‘non-stop sledgehammer … bereft of satiric zing’, while the Hollywood industry paper Variety called it an ‘alleged satire that’s about as funny as a communist food shortage’.

Even the film’s makers probably imagined that having earned back its budget from its target audience of American teenagers, their picture would soon disappear into well-deserved obscurity.

How wrong they were. For it now seems certain that The Interview will go down in history not as an indictment of Hollywood’s obsession with the lowest common denominator, but as a chilling symbol of the future of international conflict.

When, two days ago, the film’s parent company Sony announced it was cancelling its Christmas Day release, the decision was widely seen as an abject surrender to foreign pressure.

All week, North Korean hackers have been leaking secrets found in Sony’s emails, from insider gossip about the star Angelina Jolie to the script of the next James Bond film.

In an attempt to shore up wavering cinema chains who were uncertain as to whether to screen the film, Barack Obama recommended that ‘people go to the movies’.

But as pressure mounted, it became clear Sony’s American bosses lacked the courage to stand up to Kim Jong-un’s cyber bullies. And when the hackers issued a terrifying warning to American audiences, telling them to ‘remember September 11, 2001’, Sony simply lost its nerve.

Thus, The Interview has vanished from the schedules, and it seems unlikely it will ever return.

In the meantime, Hollywood figures have been queuing up to denounce Sony’s decision as an awful setback for free speech. ‘Today, the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished bedrock principle,’ said the director Judd Apatow.

The actor Rob Lowe went further: If Sony had been in charge of the Allied war effort in World War II, he said, then the Nazis would have won.

In many ways the story could hardly be a better metaphor for American foreign policy in the past few years.

After almost a decade of reckless, ham-fisted over-stretch under George W. Bush — typified by this month’s appalling revelations about the CIA’s torture programme — the U.S. has turned inwards. 

Obama’s policy in Syria and Ukraine has been a shambles, his attitude to Russia is dithering and pusillanimous, and he seems entirely bereft of ideas about how to fight back against the jihadists of Islamic State.

In this context, therefore, Sony’s surrender to the North Koreans merely looks like more of the same.

But I think there is another dimension to this story — one that should frighten every man, woman and child in the Western world.

For years, military experts have been warning that our expectations of warfare are dangerously outmoded. We still think of war as something that happens on a foreign battlefield, fought out between professional armies with tanks and guns.

But for more than a century, the front line has been moving closer and closer to the ordinary British household. From the horrors of the Blitz to the pub bombings of the IRA, our illusions of living in an island fortress have been brutally dispelled.

Cyber warfare is merely the latest frightening development in the history of human conflict — a threat to British society that could have potentially devastating consequences for millions of families.

We cannot say, though, that we were not warned.

As long ago as the spring of 2010, the former White House counter-terrorism chief Richard Clarke, who worked for the Reagan, Clinton and Bush administrations, published a book warning that the West might have lost the new cyber war before it had even officially started.

As Mr Clarke pointed out, the Russians, the Chinese and the North Koreans had already recruited legions of hackers, while Iran even boasts of having the world’s largest cyber army.

In his book Cyber War, he paints a petrifying scenario. If the Russians or North Koreans launch an all-out cyber attack, he suggests, then they could effectively bring Western society to its knees within just 15 minutes because we are so utterly dependent on electronics, which run everything from nuclear power stations to our bedside alarm clocks.

With bugs and viruses racing through computer systems, the military and the police might be paralysed.

Trains could crash, pipelines explode, the financial markets risk going into meltdown, the National Grid might crash, hospitals could fall dark, cash dispensers might go dead and ordinary life might come grinding to a halt. Last year, the People’s Liberation Army’s Shanghai-based cyber unit was caught hacking into major American corporations such as the nuclear power company Westinghouse Electric and the United States Steel Corporation.

In Britain, the head of MI5 and the director-general of GCHQ sent a letter to the bosses of all the FTSE 350 companies stating that cyber attacks against UK companies are causing significant damage to their reputations and revenues.

‘It scares me to death,’ one military insider told the Economist. ‘The destructive potential is so great.’

It sounds like the stuff of science fiction. But all military technology sounded futuristic once, from tanks and atom bombs to drones and satellites.

And some countries are already all too aware of the costs of losing a cyber war.

In the spring of 2007, Russian hackers paralysed government computers in the little republic of Estonia, a member of Nato and the European Union.

It was a classic example of imperialist bullying, carried out not with tanks and gunboats, but with computer worms and viruses. Seven years on, British and American military planners are still studying the Estonian attacks for clues to the future of cyber warfare. Even if you rarely use a computer, the dangers of a Russian or North Korean cyber attack can hardly be exaggerated.

A future in which hospitals risk being paralysed, the railways grinding to a halt, supermarkets running out of food and police computer systems collapsing is not one to be taken lightly.

Of course, the leaking of Hollywood secrets and James Bond scripts is not in the same league. But if the North Koreans can beat a giant corporation such as Sony, then who is to say they cannot take down Britain’s public services, too?

As the furore over The Interview has shown, the West is clearly on the back foot.

The former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, remarked this week: ‘No one should kid themselves. With the Sony collapse, America has lost its first cyber war. This is a very, very dangerous precedent.’ 

I think he is right. I believe the struggle over The Interview is just the start. And I suspect the shock troops in any future world war will not be blood-streaked men in battle fatigues, but pale-faced computer geeks, hunched intently over their keyboards.

In the years after the fall of the Soviet Union, we in the West were too busy congratulating ourselves on our victory to grasp that a new and potentially even deadlier challenge lay ahead.

Too complacent, too confident in our mastery of the old technology, we failed to realise that war itself was changing.

From Moscow to Pyongyang, the West faces implacable adversaries, equipped with the new digital weapons of the 21st century. If you want to see the battlefield of the future, just look around your living room.
