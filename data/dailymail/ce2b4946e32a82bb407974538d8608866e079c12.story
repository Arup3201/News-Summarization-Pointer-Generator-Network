Bearing in mind she is about to become the most hated woman in Britain, at least in the eyes of benefits cheats, Esther McVey looks very relaxed.

As the photographer’s flash gun goes off, she laughs and jokes about it’s dazzling brightness in her Scouse accent: ‘Great, it looks like it gets rid of wrinkles.’

McVey’s title of Minister for the Disabled gives the impression her job is solely to make life easier for them. But Esther the bubbly blonde ex-GMTV presenter is about to become Esther the Axewoman.

Challenge: Esther McVey, 45, who became MP for Wirral West in 2010 and is the new Minister for the Disabled, said that many of those claiming disability living allowance are not entitled to the benefits

She is to slash what Ministers say is the most abused benefit in Britain, the £13 billion a year Disability Living Allowance (DLA).

From next week, people who apply for DLA of up to £120 a week are in for a shock: they will be forced to take medical tests to weed out fraudulent claims instead of just filling in a form and getting it for life.

In her most candid interview since becoming MP for Wirral West in 2010, McVey, 45, right, tells The Mail on Sunday:

Rising benefit bill: Miss McVey, pictured in 2002, said one in 17 of the population will receive DLA within five years if the present rate of claiming continues

The number of people who get DLA has tripled to three million in 20 years and McVey says if it carries on rising at the same rate, one in 17 of the population will receive it within five years.

She says many who get DLA and are officially classed ‘disabled’ are no such thing: ‘Only three per cent of people are born with a disability, the rest acquire it through accident or illness, but people come out of it. Thanks to medical advances, bodies heal.’

The decision to introduce new tests has produced an extraordinary ‘closing-down sale’ effect, with rocketing claims as people rush to get their hands on unchecked ‘welfare for life’ before McVey’s axe falls on April 8. She says Britain simply cannot carry on doling out so much in State handouts.

McVey says Britain’s welfare bill is ‘a fifth higher than the European average, over double what America spends, six times what Japan spends. We have to have a fair and robust system, but we must make sure the billions we are spending go to the right people.’

Before becoming an MP, McVey helped run her father’s firm, got a law degree and was a successful TV presenter.

Her first memory of politics is at school. ‘I ran my first campaign when I was 11.’ she says. ‘My slogan was ‘Vote McVey, vote the right way. I’ve never surpassed it!’

Ask her to identify her political heroes and she pointedly declines to name Margaret Thatcher, a nod to her Scouse roots. ‘She wasn’t a big figure growing up in Merseyside if I’m brutally honest,’ she reveals.

‘The people I believed in were people like William Lever, the  great philanthropic industrialist –  self-made men who realised anyone could achieve. My dad started off  in scrap metal, real men doing  men’s jobs.

‘I’m not interested in academic backgrounds or who you are connected to, but your character, personality: are you a laugh to be with?

Making herself heard: Mrs McVey pictured with Sandra Howard while campaigning in 2005

McVey continues: ‘Life is about hard work and getting on with things. That may be Dad’s background in demolition, if you look how a building is constructed – the foundations, the structure – the interior design is relatively simple.’

She is glad she had plenty of experience before entering politics in her late 30s.

‘I have come in later and from a male environment. You can’t get much more male than a demolition site. I’m shyer than people give me credit for,’ she says, smiling, adding more convincingly: ‘But I can also tell people to get lost, maybe some others can’t.’

Revelation: Miss McVey said she never married because: ¿I never met the man, THE man'

She gives another fiery flash of her Liverpudlian pride when I point out Knowsley in Merseyside has the highest rate of DLA claimants.

Does that suggest swinging the lead is worse in Merseyside than elsewhere? ‘Absolutely not, I totally don’t want that down!’ she flares, pointing angrily at my notebook.

True or not, Merseyside is one of the first areas to be targeted in McVey’s DLA crackdown.

McVey has had a series of romances. Before becoming an MP she dated Ed Vaizey, now a fellow Tory Minister. Until recently she was dating Shipley Tory MP Philip Davies. ‘We’re still best mates, if that’s what you wanna know,’ she says.

Why has she never married?

‘You know what? It was never my key focus. I have had long relationships but I have never got married. I just thought it would happen. I tried and now I think it’s too late.’

What about not having had children? Is it a regret? She replies matter-of-factly: ‘No. And I really like children. I have very good mates who did very well in business and had this ticking clock and really felt they wanted to get married and have children. I was waiting for my clock to tick and it never happened.’

Why? ‘I don’t know. I obviously never met the man.’ Not one of her many boyfriends?

‘No, THE man,’ she says with a husky laugh. Is she seeing anyone at present?

‘No. But I do live with a man. And that’s me dad,’ she says, retreating behind her joky Liver Bird caricature.

You sense none of her suitors have lived up to her true hero, demolition man Jim McVey.
