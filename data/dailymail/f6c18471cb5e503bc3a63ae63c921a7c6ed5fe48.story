Floyd Mayweather Jnr insisted he remains in talks with Manny Pacquiao over their £200million mega-fight.

An announcement about a May 2 bout in Las Vegas has been expected since the pair met in Pacquiao's Miami hotel suite last week. 

But with no news forthcoming about the fight, doubts had resurfaced over a clash that has been six years in the making.

Mayweather posted on selfie app Shots: 'I set up this meeting with Manny Pacquiao to get this fight done but they will continue to tell the public it's us (who are holding up the negotiations) and that's NOT TRUE.'

The post was accompanied by a picture of him talking to Pacquiao althought it is unclear when it was taken.

Mayweather and Pacquiao came face-to-face for the first time last week when they both attended a Miami Heat basketball match.

They talked for over an hour later that night in a bid to thrash out a deal.

It was believed that the remaining issues involved the broadcast of the fight with Mayweather contracted to Showtime and Pacquiao to HBO.

But HBO president Ken Hershman said this week: 'We're here to stand by and help wherever we can to make this fight happen. We're not an impediment to that happening, and we'll do what's necessary from our end. Then, it's up to the principals.'

Pacquiao had previously issued an ultimatum to Mayweather with the demand of an answer by the end of January.

That deadline has passed but Mayweather's post indicates a deal could yet be struck.

If it can't, the pound-for-pound No 1 will likely face Miguel Cotto while Pacquiao could face Amir Khan later in May.

The 37-year-old is still unbeaten and if this fight happens, it could well be his last in professional boxing
