Rural motorists could receive a 5 pence a litre price cut under a government scheme which has been approved by the European Commission.

Some 17 remote areas of Great Britain will benefit from the discount, including Cumbria, Devon, North Yorkshire and the Scottish Highlands.

The scheme, which is similar to one already used on the Scottish Islands, now requires final approval from other EU member states through the EU council.

The government scheme comes as a report by the AA warned that motorists in many small towns are paying up to 4p more for their petrol than in urban areas  such as at the Harvest Energy Petrol Station in Birmingham where the cost of petrol has dipped below £1

It comes as a report by the AA warned that motorists in many small towns are paying up to 4p more for their petrol - despite average petrol prices dipping to their lowest level for five years.

The UK Government is pressing ahead with a formal consultation on the price cut scheme with a view to implementing it in the current Parliament.

Those living in the UK’s most remote islands already get a 5p per litre fuel reduction under the Government’s Rural Fuel Rebate scheme.

But the AA warned that some drivers might find it difficult to tell if the full rebate has been passed on while the RAC doubted whether rural motorists would ever see fuel parity with those in urban areas.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said of the EC decision: ‘This is great news for motorists in these areas and brings a duty discount a step closer. Even though fuel prices are falling across the country, they are still higher in very rural areas.’ 

The Government claims up to 125,000 motorists will benefit from the changes.

The latest AA fuel report said the average UK petrol price is 108.91p - a 7.41p dip on the mid-December figure and only 0.5p short of the second-biggest monthly fall recorded by the AA.

However supermarket chain Asda has been selling unleaded for just over 103p while an independent Harvest trader in Birmingham has sold it for 99p.

The AA says average mid-January diesel prices are 116.11p a litre, which represents a 6.05p cut on the mid-December figure.

These average figures do not take into account the latest 2p-a-litre reduction in petrol and in diesel by the four big supermarkets.

The AA said a family with two petrol cars is spending around £16.30 a month less at the pump than in mid-December, and more than £50 a month less than last July, when petrol was at 131.70p a litre.

But the AA president Edmund King warned ‘A uniform price drop doesn’t always reduce the gap between small rural towns and others.

‘Buxton, in Derbyshire, with a population of more than 20,000, has now come under the spotlight for supermarket petrol at 109.9p a litre on Monday – a penny above the UK average and 4p dearer than in towns with competitive supermarket prices.

‘Other rural towns paying 4p a litre more for their cheapest petrol include places like Ludlow in Shropshire with 11,000 residents and Liphook in Hampshire with a population of 7,000.’

Mr King added: ‘Discrimination against small rural towns of up to 20,000 inhabitants – having to pay £2 a tank more for supermarket petrol than in towns with competitive pricing.

‘Towns like Jedburgh, Hawick and Dumfries were paying 107.9p and 108.9p a litre for supermarket petrol. On either side of them, supermarket petrol was being sold for as little as 103.7p in Carlisle and Kilmarnock.’

‘Many rural towns would say that predictions of petrol at 99.9p a litre are a bad joke as they continue to struggle with the pump price lottery.’

Drivers in south west England, Yorkshire and Humberside, the north of England and Northern Ireland are enjoying the lowest petrol prices, all averaging 108.8p a litre.

East Anglia has the most expensive, at 109.4p a litre. The average price of diesel is cheapest in Northern Ireland, at 115.7p a litre, while Scotland is most expensive, averaging 116.9p.
