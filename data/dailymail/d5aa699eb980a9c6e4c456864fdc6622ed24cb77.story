John Hinckley Jr will soon be spending more than half of every month outside of his Washington mental hospital as his monthly visits to his mother's house have been extended to 17-days per trip.

Hinckley was found to be insane when he shot and wounded President Ronald Reagan in 1981.

Since 2006, he has been allowed to leave the hospital to visit his mother's Virginia home but for varying amounts of time.

Being held: John Hinckley Jr, seen here in 2003, was ruled insane after shooting and wounding President Ronald Reagan in 1981 and has been in a mental institution since

The length of those visits has increased over the years with the goal that Hinckley ultimately live outside the hospital full time.

In December, a judge ruled that Hinckley should be allowed to make visits of up to 17 days, an increase from previous 10-day visits.

The judge laid out the parameters of the monthly visits in an order Tuesday.

Hinckley's lawyer says he expects the 17-day visits to start in March and called the judge's order a 'milestone.'

The moment before: President Reagan was leaving the Washington D.C. Hilton when Hinckley attacked

Aftermath: Hinckley did not hit Reagan directly but a bullet hit the presidential limousine and it then ricocheted and hit the President in the chest

Hinckley was 25-years-old when he opened fire as President Reagan as he left a Washington D.C. hotel on March 30, 1931 in an attempt to impress actress Jodi Foster after becoming obsessed with her in the film Taxi Driver.Â 

He fired six shots and one of the bullets ricocheted off the presidential limousine and hit Reagan.

He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was ordered to be confined at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in D.C.
