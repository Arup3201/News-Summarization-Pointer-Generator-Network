Thirty-eight years ago a sixth-grade class in Edina, Minnesota, buried a time capsule in front of their elementary school's science room, expecting to find it again one day.

But their hopes of digging up old memories decades later proved difficult to realize - when none of them could find the capsule again.

The group of classmates came back to Concord Elementary School last weekend, armed with shovels and determined to find what the buried.

A little to the left? The former classmates at Concord Elementary School, Endina, Minnesota, couldn't find their old capsule

But despite digging a huge pit outside of the school buildings they remember so well, the 1976 capsule was nowhere to be found, KSTP reported.

Enthusiastic diggers milling around the schoolyard were heard saying 'we know it's here somewhere', while digging up an ever-wider section of the grass.

They were keen to discover what the capsule holds, as none of them can remember. They were encouraged to stash away their memories of the '70s by their old science teacher, Mr Schweer, who died this year. 

'I'm sure it's around here somewhere': One classmate speaks to a news crew about their ill-fated attempt

But eventually the class, now aged around 50, gave up on their search.

One digger, Jeff Dunnett, told KARE-11: 'We've really circled it. We really thought we'd find it within a few minutes.'

Another added: 'We do know it's here though - because that's the science room and... it's just out here.' A third suggested it may have sunk deeper into the earth.

The group reportedly plans to make another attempt soon.
