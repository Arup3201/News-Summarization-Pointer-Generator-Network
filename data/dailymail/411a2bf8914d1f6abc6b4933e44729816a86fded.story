Manager Harry Redknapp admits QPR have to stay in the Barclays Premier League to have a chance of holding on to in-form striker Charlie Austin.

Austin has scored seven goals in the top flight already, making him the joint top English scorer in the division.

QPR are keen to convince their star man to extend his contract, which has only 18 months left to run, but Redknapp believes surviving the drop will prove the decisive factor.

'Do we need to stay up to keep him? Staying up will be very important,' Redknapp said. 'He's happy here and he wants to play in the Premier League now.

'He's had a taste of it and once you play in the Premier League you want to stay there. If he can go and get 20 goals this year that will help us do that.'

Austin was playing for Poole Town in the ninth tier of English football only six years ago.

The 25-year-old moved to Burnley via a successful spell at Swindon before sealing a £4million switch to QPR in August 2013.

'How much is he worth now? I couldn't put a price on him, he'll start wanting a new contract,' Redknapp joked.

'I don't know what he's worth, but certainly more than £4m.'

QPR host Burnley on Saturday looking to climb out of the bottom three for the first time since September.

Austin will be up against his former club, whose new talisman Danny Ings is also hitting form with three goals in his last three games.

'They both scored goals last year in the Championship,' Redknapp said.

'Ings is in the England Under-21 team, I certainly expected him to score goals this year and Charlie has been the same, he's carried it on.

'If they were playing in teams at the top of the league who were making dozens of chances every game they would get a lot more goals as well.

'It's harder when you're playing for a team lower down, you don't get so many chances and you have to take those that come along. That's what they're doing at the moment.'
