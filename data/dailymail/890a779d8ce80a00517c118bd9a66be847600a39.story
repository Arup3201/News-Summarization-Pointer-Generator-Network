The campaign was shot by industry heavyweights Mert Alas and Marcus Piggot and styled by Katy England.

The Hollywood actress has been hailed by the brand as a 'generational icon of beauty and elegance.'

It says: 'As the embodiment of the Givenchy woman, Julia showcases all facets of that character with strength and eternal style.' 

The brand, which is loved by Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, believe that Julia is the perfect match for Givenchy’s code of modernity.

Speaking about his choice, Riccardo Tisco told Style.com: 'I respect her a lot as a beauty and as a woman. She’s a very intelligent girl. And a very funny girl. Super-funny. And very confident of herself, which is very much my woman.

'I thought it would be difficult because Julia really doesn’t do [campaigns], so I was surprised that she said yes.'

Riccardo wanted to convey Julia's true beauty, so asked her to go make-up free for the shoot.

Speaking about her reaction to the bare-faced pictures, he said: 'She liked it, she said because “I can see myself, my real self", which was the concept, not to try to make her glamorous.'

The role that made her: Julia shot to fame headlining the romantic comedy Pretty Woman back in 1990 and has since become one of Hollywood's most prominent stars

Above all, the designer believes that Julia is a true star and has cemented her status in Hollywood thanks to her talents.

He said: 'Today, celebrity has become so much [about] how many followers you have, how big you are on Facebook. So many celebrities are celebrities today not because of their talent. That’s fine, it’s the moment today. But she’s an iconic actress.'

Julia shot to fame headlining the romantic comedy Pretty Woman back in 1990. Other famed roles including Notting Hill, Runaway Bride, Ocean's Eleven, Valentine's Day and Eat Pray Love followed.

So successful is Julia that she's one of the highest-paid actresses in the world and has been named one of People magazine's most beautiful women eleven times.

She is also currently the face of Lancome's fragrance.
