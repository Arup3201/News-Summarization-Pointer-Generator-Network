He was only a hair's breadth away from seeing his beloved £350,000 supercar crushed to a pulp after it was seized by police for driving offences.

So you might think the owner of this glow-in-the-dark Lamborghini would be a bit more careful next time.

But within hours of retrieving his purple sports car from the Metropolitan Police, he found himself on the wrong side of the law again after being slapped with a parking ticket.

Not again! The owner of this £350,000 glow-in the-dark Lamborghini was slapped with a parking ticket on the day he retrieved it from police who had seized it for driving offences

Oops: The supercar, believed to be owned by a member of Qatar's ruling family, was apparently parked illegally outside the posh eatery Hakkasan in London's exclusive district of Mayfair

D'oh! The ticket was placed on the windscreen by a parking inspector from the City of Westminster

Flashy motor: The Lamborghini Aventador is one of the world's fastest supercars

The driver, believed to be 24-year-old
 Nasser Al-Thani, a member of Qatar's ruling family, allegedly left his 
car illegally parked outside Mayfair's exclusive restaurant Hakkasan in London yesterday.

Just a few days ago, it was being 
displayed outside New Scotland Yard with a banner saying 'Uninsured 
vehicle seized by police' after he was stopped last month for failing to produce a licence or the correct insurance.

The Lamborghini
 Aventador - with a paint job that made it look like something out of 
the sci-fi film Tron - had been loaded on the back of a truck near Harrod's in Knightsbridge last month and used as a warning to other uninsured drivers.

The owner finally returned yesterday to collect his 
vehicle after showing police correct documentation, but faces charges.

A Met Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'The driver of the purple Lamborghini has since presented the necessary documents which now make the vehicle legally roadworthy.

'He was processed and faces a summons in court.'

The sports car, valued at around £300,000, could have been sent to the crusher after it was seized

A Met Police spokesman said the Lamborghini was one a several supercars taken by officers

Sci-fi: The customised car has scissor doors and a glow-in-the-dark paint job that makes it look like something out of the film Tron

Stopped: Police seized the car after its driver failed to produce a driving licence or correct insurance documents

Problem: Pictured earlier in the day, the supercar understood to be owned by 24-year-old Nasser Al-Thani, of Qatar's ruling family, was also missing a front numberplate

Attraction: A crowd gathered around the unusual-looking car as police waited for a tow truck to arrive

Last month, police stopped the car, which was also missing its front number plate, on Brompton Street and had it towed away after Mr Al-Thani failed to produce a licence or the correct insurance.

A crowd gathered around the ostentatious scissor-door car, which has been customised by a Japanese tuning company, as three police officers on motorbikes waited for the tow-truck to arrive. 

When a low-loader finally appeared, an officer slowly drove the supercar onto the back before it was transported to a local pound.

One onlooker said: 'It is great when the 
wealthy foreign tourists come over to London every summer as you always 
see these amazing supercars.

'The Lamborghini looked like something out of Tron, it was absolutely stunning.' 

Ticket: Police attached a note explaining why they were seizing the Lamborghini

The Lamborghini was one a several supercars taken by officers as part of its Operation Cubo.

A Met Police spokesman said: 'We have been seizing many types of cars, but sports cars have been among them.

'We have had a few Porsaches, BMW X5s, and a Ferrari - that one got crushed and in fact the vast majority of them are.'

Operation Cubo has so far taken place on 20 separate days, with 656 vehicles seized one day last month.

The force said 135 arrests were made on this occasion for offences 
including robbery, drugs supply, metal theft, weapon-related offences 
and for being wanted offenders.

A total of 10,318 vehicles have been seized as part of Operation Cubo since October 2011.

Wealthy Middle-Eastern drivers descend on the capital in their supercars every summer and have even been the subject of a Channel 4 documentary, Millionaire Boy Racers, which showed angry residents saying their driving style was ruining the area for locals.

The Al-Thani family are renowned for 
their wacky supercars and hit the headlines three years ago when 
their blue Lamborghini and Koenigseggs were clamped outside Harrods.

The Lamborghini Aventador is one of the world’s fastest supercars.

It is powered by a 6.5-litre V12 engine which gives a 0-62mph time of 2.9 seconds and a top speed of 217mph.
