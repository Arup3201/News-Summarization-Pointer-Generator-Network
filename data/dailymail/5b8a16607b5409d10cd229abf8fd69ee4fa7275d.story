Leicester have signed striker Leonardo Ulloa from Brighton for around £7million, the Premier League newcomers have announced.

The Argentinian, who turns 28 this weekend, has penned a four-year deal at the King Power Stadium and could feature in Sunday's pre season friendly against Everton in Thailand.

Ulloa has scored 25 goals in 52 appearances for Brighton since joining them from Spanish side Almeria in January 2013, including 16 goals last term to help the Seagulls reach the Sky Bet Championship play-offs, where they lost their semi final against Derby.

Brighton confirmed they had received a club-record fee for the striker, saying in a statement: 'Leo Ulloa has completed his transfer from Brighton & Hove Albion to Leicester City, after the club reluctantly agreed to sell the striker for a club record transfer fee.'

Leicester manager Nigel Pearson said the former Castellon and San Lorenzo forward was someone the Championship winners had been looking at for quite a while.

He said on his club's website: 'We identified Leo as a player that could help us move forward quite some time ago.

'He complements the forwards we already have very well and his attributes broaden the options available to us, which will be important this season. I'm delighted we've been able to add him to the squad.

'He has adapted extremely well to the English game in a relatively short period of time and I'm sure he will have a great deal to offer us in the Premier League.'
