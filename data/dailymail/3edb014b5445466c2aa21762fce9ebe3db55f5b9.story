Benedict Cumberbatch has hit out at the lack of opportunities for black British actors – and says they have a far better chance of success in Hollywood than the UK.

The 38-year-old, nominated for an Oscar for The Imitation Game, told US interviewer Tavis Smiley that stars such as Idris Elba and David Oyelowo thrive in America more than at at home.

The Sherlock star pointed to films such as Selma and 12 Years A Slave, saying: ‘It’s an even playing field. [These actors] paid their dues for years by just doing beautiful performances.

‘I think as far as coloured actors go it gets really difficult in the UK, and a lot of my friends have had more opportunities here [in the US] than in the UK and that’s something that needs to change.

‘As long as we pay our taxes over here when we work, I think it’s fair game. Meryl Streep can come over and play Margaret Thatcher. 

'Why can’t we come over and play in your sand pit?’

He commended the comedian Lenny Henry, who campaigns for more work for minorities in the UK, calling him ‘a real force for good’. 

He said: ‘He’s rightfully launched a campaign because something’s gone wrong. . . I don’t want to get involved in any debates about that, but it’s clear when you see certain migratory patterns that there are more opportunities here than there are in the UK.’

Black British actors are currently storming Tinseltown. Oyelowo, who moved to Los Angeles seven years ago in a bid to find more work, plays Martin Luther King Jr in Selma – which stars another Brit, Carmen Ejogo, as King’s wife Coretta Scott King.

Many expected Oyelowo to be nominated for the Best Actor Oscar, and his snub by the academy has prompted a discussion about lack of diversity in this year’s awards.

US role: Benedict Cumberbatch starred alongside Chiwetel Ejiofor in 12 Years a Slave

Last year, Briton Chiwetel Ejiofor won an Oscar nod for his portrayal of Solomon Northup in 12 Years A Slave – in which Cumberbatch also appeared. 

Idris Elba played Stringer Bell in HBO’s series The Wire, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw was lauded by critics in 2013 film Belle.

Cumberbatch also said that he had no rivalry with Eddie Redmayne, tipped to beat him to the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything. 

He joked: ‘I’m very proud of my work. I don’t mind if I’m the guy who’s the bridegroom and someone else is the bride.’
