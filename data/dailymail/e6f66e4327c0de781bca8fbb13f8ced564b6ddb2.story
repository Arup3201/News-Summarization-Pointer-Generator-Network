Ian Watkins, lead singer of Lostprophets and ex boyfriend of Fearne Cotton, was refused bail today and remanded in custody after being accused of plotting to rape a child last year

The singer of top rock band Lostprophets was refused bail today and remanded in custody after being accused of plotting to rape a child.

Frontman Ian Watkins, 35, is facing six child sex offences - including conspiring with a woman fan, 24, to rape a girl under the age of 13.

The singer and two women are also accused of conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a child under 13.

Watkins - a former boyfriend of TV presenter Fearne Cotton - spent Christmas in Parc Prison in Bridgend, South Wales, after being arrested in December last year.

He yesterday appeared before Judge Eleri Rees in Cardiff Crown Crown Court via video link from the jail.

In a short hearing his application for bail was rejected and he was remanded in custody ahead of a plea hearing later this month.

Watkins, of Pontypridd, South Wales, is charged with conspiring to rape a girl under the age of 13 and to engage in sexual activity with a child under 13.

He is also charged with three separate charges of possession, making and distribution of indecent images of children, and stands accused of possession of 'extreme pornography' - some involving animals.

An earlier court heard 40 images of children and child abuse were being investigated by police.

Two women - one aged 20 from Doncaster and the other 24 from Bedford - are also remanded in custody on similar conspiracy charges involving children.

A statement from fellow band members posted a statement on their website in December said: 'Following charges made today against Ian Watkins, we find ourselves in a state of shock. We are learning about the details of the investigation along with you.

'It is a difficult time for us and our families, and we want to thank our fans for their support as we seek answers.'

Mr Watkins dated TV presenter Cotton for almost a year in 2005 and in 2007 he was romantically linked to model Alexa Chung.

Tattooed Watkins formed Lostprophets in 1997 with friends from the small former mining town of Pontypridd.

They started playing gigs around South Wales and were eventually signed, releasing breakthrough single Shinobi vs Dragon Ninja in 2001.

The band were at the forefront of the popular 'Nu Metal' sound and attracted thousands of fans.

Debut album The Fake Sound of Progress achieved Platinum status selling more than 300,000 copies.

The band began to make high profile appearances at UK music festivals and on TV shows and before long they were selling out large arenas.

In 2004 they released second album Start Something which went Gold in America - with more than 500,000 copies bought.

The band embarked on a world tour before recording Liberation Transmission, which was released in 2006.

Lead single Rooftops got to eight in the UK charts - their joint best performance with Last Train Home.
