Preston's 'most prolific burglar' Thomas Green was caught after an ex recognised his face in CCTV images released by police

A 'one-man crimewave' is back behind bars after an ex-girlfriend shopped him to police having recognised his face as that of a man wanted in connection with 12 burglaries.

Preston's 'most prolific burglar' Thomas Green was caught on CCTV as he carried out his latest crime spree, targeting a string of businesses stealing items worth £20,000.

Despite bragging on Facebook he could outrun 10 police officers the repeat offender was snared by detectives who chased him through a series of gardens jumping over fences.

While evading the law, Green posted a series of messages on the social networking site showing him bare-chested as he claimed he was building up his tan ahead of his next prison stint.

They came after the 27-year-old realised he had been caught on CCTV during several of the raids he carried out in June and July.

Appearing at Preston Crown Court today, the yob who has a criminal record dating back to when he was 13 years old, admitted 12 burglaries, a shop theft and had five other similar offences taken into consideration.

He swore loudly as he was jailed for two years and eight months, after 32 victims and witnesses lined up ready to testify against him.

During his latest spree, the thief, caused damage to premises, pushed a shop worker into a cupboard before stealing a phone, broke into a bed shop through the roof landing on the mattress before stealing a quantity of money.

Lancashire Police, who dubbed him 
'Preston's most prolific burglar' said he burgled the Cash In A Dash 
shop in the city after getting in through the roof and stealing £4,500 
of electricals, jewellery and money.

The 27-year-old, who has a criminal record dating back to when he was 13, admitted 12 burglaries, a shop theft and five other similar offences when he appeared at Preston Crown Court for sentencing

While on the run this summer, Green took to Facebook to boast that he could outrun 10 police officers. He was caught after an ex recognised his face as that of a man wanted by Lancashire Police

Green was sent back to prison for two years and eight months. While evading the law he posted pictures of himself on Facebook bare-chested claiming he was getting a tan ahead of his next prison stint

And he helped himself to three TVs worth £2,500 from another store as well as stealing mobile phones from staff at McDonald's in Deepdale.

The force said he targeted businesses across the city from interior design companies to Post Offices, hairdressers to fishing shops and newsagents.

His criminal rampage came to an end on August 2 when police officers received a tip-off as to his whereabouts.

Green believes the information came from an ex-girlfriend, the court heard.

One entry posted by Green while he was on the run, said: 'fun fun fun in the sun sun sun hopefully at last this heatwave has begun (sic).'

In another he added: 'It’s boiling am stood in the garden tryin to get a tan that can last a 2 year stretch (sic).'

In
a third he went on: 'hello hello hello everyone hope everyones avin a 
gud day and lookin forward to a hot weekend. Its guna be a sunny day so 
get da f*** outta bed every1 (sic).'

While in the middle of his latest
crime spree, he posted another message on his Facebook page saying: 
'Don’t I feel good. No gym for eighteen months but can still out run 10 
police officers who go everyday. Stamina boy or what? ha ha. (sic)'

In his last Facebook post before his arrest Green wrote, 'Grassing exes and their boyfriends.

'Im goin jail so watch now you snitching bastards - yous deserve each other. People don’t usually last long these days due to grasses!!! (sic)'

Mr Recorder Guy Mathieson sentencing Green told the court the sheer volume of offences and the damage caused to property meant prison was 'inevitable'.

He said: 'Before I came into court I wrote down
the words ‘totally selfish’.

'That’s how these papers read, someone who 
gives no thought to other people’s property, feelings or indeed care and
concern other than your totally selfish need to get your next fix.

'That
was before I read the very eloquently well written letter from yourself
that puts everything into perspective and offers an explanation, not an
excuse for why you are in the state you are in.'

Det 
Insp Warren Atkinson, of Preston police, said: 'Thomas Green can only be
described as a one man crime spree.

'His crimes have been committed 
mainly against commercial premises but also caused staff distress and 
inconvenience.

'He is a 
career criminal and one of the city’s most prolific burglars. As he got 
more desperate he became less and less concerned about CCTV.

'It is great
news for traders and residents that he will be off Preston’s streets 
for some time.'
