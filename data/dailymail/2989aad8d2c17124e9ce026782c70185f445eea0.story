Philippe Mexes was sent off late on for grabbing the throats of Lazio players Stefano Mauri and Lorik Cana in AC Milan's 3-1 defeat in Serie A.

The defender lost his cool in the closing stages of the game on Saturday evening, appearing to grab the opposition players round the neck.

His team-mate Riccardo Montolivo attempted to contain Mexes' red mist, but could do nothing about him seeing red in the closing stages.

The defender was eventually dismissed for the incident as AC Milan were beaten 3-1

Marco Parolo scored twice for the home side as they heaped more woe on Milan at the Stadio Olimpico. 

The hosts hit back from behind to claim victory and leave the Rossoneri without a win in their last five Serie A games.

Jeremy Menez had given Milan a fourth-minute lead which lasted until two minutes after the break when Parolo netted his opener.

Five minutes later Miroslav Klose put Lazio in front and Parolo's second nine minutes from time effectively sealed win which sends the hosts up to fifth.
