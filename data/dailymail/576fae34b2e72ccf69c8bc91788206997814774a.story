Liam Strother, pictured, has been accused of bedding British women in Cambodia before stealing from them

The British expatriate community in Cambodia have been warned to be on the alert for a one-man crime wave being operated by a teenage Briton described as a ‘conning Cassonova’.

He is said to have won the confidence of beautiful women before bedding them and then stealing credit cards, cameras, money and other valuable items.

Other tourists are alleged to have been cheated by Liam Strother, who is described as being ‘something of a Cassonova’, aged about 19 from Grantown-on-Spey, in the Scottish Highlands.

Britons living in Cambodia have been so alarmed by the alleged thieving activities of Strother that they have posted his photo on an expatriate forum and have urged businesses to be on the look out for him.

According to the expatriate forum Khmer 440, Strother is reported to have left a trail of unpaid bills in expatriate-owned bars and guest houses the southern town of Sihanoukville, where he is alleged to have stolen personal items from tourists and Britons he’d befriend and who had allowed him into their homes or hotels.

‘Having worn out his welcome at the beach, been briefly jailed and had his passport confiscated by the Khmer police, Strother moved to (the capital) Phnom Penh, where his one-man crime spree has continued unabated,’ the forum states.

‘In the last two weeks we have received reports of him once again running up large debts at hostels and guesthouses and just as in Sihanoukville, befriending female travellers and then stealing their money and valuables.’

The Briton was arrested in the southern resort of Sihanoukville (pictured) on charges which include filming her naked against her will

Expatriate residents writing to the forum have added their warnings.

One man said he had worked with Strother near Grantown-on-Spey where he allegedly stole money from a credit card machine, after which he was arrested and allegedly spent time in juvenile detention in Scotland.

The former owner of a lodge in Scotland wrote that Strother had stolen from his credit card machine. ‘I had him arrested and he was charged. He will steal from anybody. Avoid him.’
