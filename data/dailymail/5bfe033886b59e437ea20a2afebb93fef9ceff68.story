Prince Harry gave a rare radio interview this morning in a bid to raise the profile of September's Invictus Games.

But in true Prince Philip style, he couldn't resist a cheeky quip, telling DJ Chris Evans that 'you look like you've been to a few' when the veteran host mentioned music festivals.

The prince, who did the interview alongside former Royal Marines JJ Chalmers and Luke Darlington, went on to reveal that the Invictus Games could become an annual event.

'This is definitely going to be a regular
 event,' he insisted. 'We’re still trying to work out whether we do it next year or the
 year after and whether it’s going to be within the UK or whether it’s 
going to be abroad.

'But the legacy has already started and if we can use
 it as a stepping stone for some of these individuals to move onto the 
Paralympics, great.

'If some of them want to use it as a one-off to get 
themselves back on the road and then as a stepping stone to employment, 
then just as good. We will use the Invictus Games for as long as it’s 
needed.'

Harry, who also told Evans that, contrary to rumours, he remains a serving army officer, has been planning the Invictus Games for more than a year.

Inspired by the American Warrior Games which sees injured servicemen from the Navy, Airforce and Army do battle on the sports field, Harry said his aim was to make the British version 'bigger and better' than the original.

'The Americans have had
 the Warrior Games now for the last four and a half, five years,' he told Evans. 'They 
have the Navy against the RAF against the Army.

'We went over there - I
 had a team of 30 UK guys that joined in with the Americans and 
basically saw this event take place - and decided that it was such a 
wonderful concept we should steal it, make it bigger, make it better and
 bring it back home.'

The resulting games will take place between the 10th and 14th September and will see 400 competitors from 14 countries compete at Olympic venues in London.

Tickets for the Invictus Games go on sale tomorrow and Harry said that he hopes to see every seat in the venues, which include the Copper Box, filled up.

Passion project: Prince Harry was at the studio to promote the Invictus Games which open in September

'We’ve got 55 000 tickets in total,' said the prince. 'We’ve
 sold a lot and, you know, we want to sell more.

'My main effort right 
from the beginning of this whole story was to ensure that we provide the
 best opportunities and the best atmosphere for these venues, and the 
Copper Box has, I think, 6,000 seats in it. I want every single one filled 
so come and help fill it.'

He also the Invictus Games rock concert and hinted that there might be more big names to add to a line-up that already includes the Foo Fighters and the Kaiser Chiefs.

'The concert, which everyone 
knows about, is being headlined by the Foo Fighters. We’ve got Ellie 
Goulding, James Blunt and numerous other people some of which I’m not 
allowed to mention.

'So the concert itself will be fantastic and, as I 
said earlier, a real chance to come and celebrate and cheer on these 
guys as they’re going to be a part of the concert.'

The Invictus Games will also have opening and closing ceremonies - both of which will be attended by Harry himself, who added, as he left the studio: 'Be there!'

While much of the attention was on Prince Harry this morning, the marines who accompanied him into the BBC studio have fascinating stories of their own.

Royal Marines JJ Chalmers and Luke Darlington were both injured while serving in Afghanistan with 42 Commando and hope to take part in the Invictus Games.

'I think the Invictus Games
 is going to be incredible for a few reasons,' says Chalmers, who suffered severe injuries to his arms and legs after an IED exploded nearby.

'Once upon a time I woke up in a hospital bed absolutely broken 
thinking I’ll never do this again. I’ve got to the point where I realise
 that I can do a lot of things, but not only do them, but I can compete 
in them.

'I just want to keep pushing the boundaries of what I’m capable 
of doing, and competition is one way of doing it.'

Fellow marine Luke Darlington suffered a penetrating brain Injury, which left him in a coma for four weeks, a partial right side paralysis and 25 per cent less brain capacity.

'I don’t have any regrets,' he says. 'I went through a phase in my life when I thought I couldn’t go on and live like this.

'But then I realised it didn’t make me feel any better, so I stopped. I want to take part in the Invictus Games because the opportunity to represent the UK would be a brilliant feeling.

'Sport, especially cycling, has helped me enormously. Probably even more psychologically than physically. It’s enabled me to believe in myself again.'
