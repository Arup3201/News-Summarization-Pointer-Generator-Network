WHAT MORE DOES WAYNE HAVE TO DO

When Louis van Gaal said he needed a 20-goal-a-season striker, I almost laughed. Manchester United have spent huge money and now he is saying Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie or Radamel Falcao can’t score 20 goals? Do me a favour. 

Rooney issued the perfect response on Saturday. I still don’t know why Van Gaal insists on playing him in midfield. In his career Rooney averages 18.8 goals a season. At United that figure is 20.6 goals. Still not good enough, Louis? 

Even if he only meant league goals, Rooney still ranks highly. Thierry Henry, one of the deadliest strikers in Premier League history and my Sky colleague at Wembley on Sunday, only scored 20 league goals in a season five times. Wayne has done it twice. His Premier League average is 14.1 a season but Alan Shearer, the league’s leading goalscorer, averaged 18.6. Using Van Gaal’s maths, even Shearer couldn’t get into this United team…

Louis van Gaal's suggestion that he needs a 20-goal-a-season striker is laughable - he has Wayne Rooney

THE BACK FOUR LOVE TO SCORE

It was not a vintage final, but Chelsea’s back four held the key to victory at Wembley. Last time they played Tottenham they conceded five. On Sunday they didn’t give them a sniff. Not only that but they were a threat at every set piece — Spurs looked fragile whenever John Terry and Co. went up. The Chelsea defence has contributed 17 goals and 13 assists this season and typify Jose Mourinho’s style: win at all costs.

HAMMERS MUST AVOID FLAT FINISH

It was a surprise to see a Sam Allardyce team concede three set-piece goals. They are normally well organised, but I wonder if Big Sam’s contract situation is affecting the players. 

It’s the chairmen’s prerogative not to talk deals until the summer, but if the players aren’t sure the manager will be there, they might wonder why they should keep playing for him. Alex Song in particular was poor on Saturday and after a fine season for the club, it would be a pity if it tailed off. 

Sam Allardyce needs to turn West Ham's form around to avoid a depressing end to the season

Peter Crouch has now scored 46 Premier League headers, equalling Alan Shearer’s record in the competition.

PETER PERFECT

When I played alongside Peter Crouch at Southampton, I was laughed at for saying he was good enough for England. Crouch has spent his career fighting people’s perceptions, but there is no doubt he has made the absolute most of his abilities. 

He scored a fantastic header against Hull but, even at 6ft 7in, heading may not even be the best part of his game. He’s got a great touch, scored some fantastic goals — scissor kicks against Galatasaray, hat-tricks against Arsenal, volleys against Man City — and has enjoyed some memorable moments.

BRENDAN'S NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION 

After that brilliant win over Man City, Liverpool are bang in the race for the top four. And here is a stat to prove it. In his three years in charge, Brendan Rodgers has lost just four league games after January 1. That is some record. 

Liverpool obviously tailor their training to perfection in the new year and make sure they are in form at just the right time. It helped their title challenge last season and it could be key to Champions League qualification this time round. They were excellent against City, with two world class goals, and they proved there is life after Steven Gerrard. With no Europa League football to distract them now, there’s no doubt Liverpool have what it takes to hunt down and catch Manchester United and Arsenal.

MURRAY'S MOMENT

Glenn Murray was key in Crystal Palace’s promotion to the Premier League but will have been gutted to miss most of 2013-14 with injury. He spent the first half of this season on loan but at Upton Park he looked every inch a top-flight striker. His movement was good, he held the ball up well and though he was lucky with his first goal, his second was top class. Yes, he tainted his day with a silly red card, but he looked like he was loving every minute. He deserves it.

SWANS FLYING UNDER MONK

When Swansea sold Wilfried Bony I feared for them, but Garry Monk’s team have continued as if nothing has happened. Their win at Burnley was scrappy but it was another three points and the club is in its best ever position after 27 games. Brendan Rodgers and Michael Laudrup might be more ‘glamorous’ names but, as our table shows, Monk is outperforming both. I like the way his team plays, I admire his honesty and if Swansea keep it up, he will be more than justified in asking for extra investment in the summer.

Swansea City manager Garry Monk has coped exceptionally well with the departure of Wilfried Bony 

VILLA ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF SOME VICTORIES

In the last 10 seasons, the average number of points needed to stay up has been 36. This season it could be even lower. Either way, Aston Villa face an uphill struggle. Tim Sherwood’s side are 14 points shy of that average with 11 games left. They’ll need at least three or four wins but when they have won just five all season, and with away games at Manchester United, Tottenham, Manchester City and Southampton to come, that’s easier said than done. I think they will survive but Sherwood has to make the numbers add up.

P.S. 

It was great to see Jonas Gutierrez back at Newcastle after his battles with testicular cancer and he got a fantastic reception. It’s exactly what he deserved.
