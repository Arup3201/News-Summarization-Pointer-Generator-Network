Scottish mathematicians believe that 'self replicating' robotic space probes sent by alien civilisations could already be in our solar system.

The University of Edinburgh study warns that the probes are probably so hi-tech they appear invisible to us as we don't have technology advanced enough to detect them.

While our Voyager probe has just reached the edge of our solar system, older and more technologically advanced civilisations could have launched similar probes years before us that are already here.

Mathematicians believe robotic space probes, perhaps slightly similar to Nasa's Van Allen (pictured) have been sent by alien civilisations and could be in our solar system

Mathematicians Duncan
 Forgan and Arwen Nicholson believe that alien races could have sent 
probes that 'slingshot' round stars using their gravity to cover ground 
quickly, Yahoo! News reported.

The researchers analysed how a 'fleet' of probes could travel through space in a paper published in the International Journal of Astrobiology.

They said probes that 'self 
replicate' and build new versions of themselves from dust and gas while 
traveling through space, could be in our solar system already.

Dr Forgan thinks that as we have not seen any of these probes could mean that we are alone in our galaxy.

He said: 'The fact we haven't seen probes of this type makes it difficult to believe that probe building civilisations have existed in the Milky Way in the last few million years.'

The mathematicians calculated that alien probes would only need to travel at 10 per cent of the speed of light in order to explore every part of our galaxy within 10 million years.

They think that the probes can use 
'slingshot manoeuvres' around stars to increase their velocity by using 
energy from the star's motion around the galactic centre.

The study re frames the question posed in the 'Fermi Paradox' about the search for alien life

In 1953 physicist Enrico Fermi asked 'where is everybody?'

The mathematicians 'prove' that alien probes could technically be close by in our solar system

Nasa expert Robert Freitas thinks that they have been designed to appear invisible to us - so we can't prove they are nearby

Dr Forgan thinks the probes will make contact when we have passed their intelligence test - perhaps by sensing their presence

Our Voyager probe uses a similar technique on planets in the solar system, but utilising the larger gravity of a star would lead to a much bigger speed boost.

The mathematicians used computing power to inform their predictions, which might not sound out of place in a sci-fi novel.

Their work shows that it is mathematically possible for alien probes to be close by, but does not explain why they have not been in touch.

The scientists said: 'We can conclude that a fleet of 
self-replicating probes can indeed explore the Galaxy in a sufficiently 
short time...orders of magnitude less than the age of the Earth.'

They muse that the alien probes would have been programmed not to all arrive at the same time, or their presence could look like a hostile attack and cause panic on Earth.

In a paper from 2011, Jacob
 Haqq-Misra of the Rock Ethics Institute wrote that alien artifacts 
might already exist in our solar system without us knowing, simply 
because we haven't looked for them hard enough.

Our Voyager probe (pictured) 'slingshots' around planets. Taking account of such techniques to gain a speed boost, the mathematicians' theory shows it is technically possible for alien probes to be in our solar system

The Scottish mathematicians draw on Nasa space expert, Robert Freitas's idea from 1983 that supposes that alien probes have been designed to appear invisible to us.

Dr Forgan believes a probe's camouflage could be set up to test the intelligence of our civilisation

Only when a test is met, such as a species being able to detect a probe, would it attempt to communicate.

He notes that evidence of broken probes is unlikely as any aliens attempting large-scale exploration of the universe would be skilled engineers.

He thinks that such civilisations would send probes that can self-replicate over the incredibly long distances traveled.
