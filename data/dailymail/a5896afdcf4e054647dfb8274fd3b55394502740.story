Italian police have rescued a woman from a flat where she was locked for eight years, surrounded by rubbish and with no heating.

The 36-year-old woman - who is only named as Chiara - was found naked in the squalid apartment, in a residential area of Naples, holding a hairdryer to herself to warm her body.

Her mother and aunt have since been arrested.

The police investigated the flat after they were alerted by neighbours because of a 'terrible smell' coming from the apartment.

In it there was only electrical energy, but no gas nor heating. 

She was found in terrible general conditions and poorly nourished -  but smiled when she moved her first steps out of the apartment.

Her mother, 69, a retired teacher, is said to have visited the flat twice a week, to leave some food in bags on the floor.  She lived with her sister not far from the flat

But apparently the unnamed mother did not clean or assist her daughter, or left her out

Police have since arrested her mother, aunt and the concierge of the apartment building where the woman lived
