Conservatives suggested Mr Miliband¿s ¿appeasement¿ of Russia, a staunch ally of Bashar al Assad, had contributed to the current crisis

Senior Tories last night prompted an angry row with Labour by claiming Ed Miliband’s vote against military action in Syria helped embolden Russia to invade part of Ukraine.

Several prominent Conservatives suggested Mr Miliband’s ‘appeasement’ of Russia, a staunch ally of Syrian tyrant Bashar al Assad, had contributed to the current crisis.

Treasury minister Sajid Javid, a close ally of Chancellor George Osborne, said there was a ‘direct link between Miliband’s cynical vote against [the] Syria motion and Russia’s actions on Ukraine’, adding that this made the Labour leader ‘completely unfit to lead Britain’.

Tory planning minister Nick Boles said David Cameron ‘was right to urge Parliament to stand up to [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin and punish Assad’s use of chemical weapons,’ adding: ‘Look where Miliband’s weakness has led us.’

Penny Mordaunt, parliamentary private  secretary to the Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, agreed that the ‘car crash’ of last summer’s vote against intervention in Syria had a bearing on the current crisis.

Mr Miliband and several backbench Conservatives voted down a Coalition motion on missile strikes against Syria last August, despite chemical weapons attacks on hundreds of civilians by its regime.

In the wake of Mr Cameron’s worst defeat as Prime Minister, Tories accused the Labour leader of privately indicating he would support a motion paving the way for military strikes but then changed his mind, something Labour denies.

The Labour leader has since taken credit for persuading the world to turn back from a rush to war in Syria, since the shock defeat in Parliament was followed by retreats by the US and other western allies.

Putin repeatedly warned that any western military action in Syria would be illegal and threatened to prop up the Assad administration. Damascus has since agreed to destroy its chemical weapons arsenals. Some analysts say the failure to act against one of Putin’s key allies has encouraged the Russian president, but have blamed President Barack Obama rather than Mr Miliband.

Former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind agreed that some of Putin’s boldness can be traced back to the Syrian situation, when Mr Obama insisted the use of chemical weapons by Damascus would be a ‘red line’ but then failed to act.

‘It was one aspect of what has given Putin, he believes, the confidence to do what he’s doing, yes,’ he said.

Mr Obama spoke with Putin for 90 minutes on Saturday. An official described the talks as ‘candid’.

Last night Mr Miliband dismissed the attacks on him, saying: ‘At this dangerous time for the world, the British people do not expect politicians to be indulging in petty point-scoring. What we need is for all parties in Britain to put politics aside so we can find a swift solution to the crisis in Ukraine.’ Mr Miliband suggested diplomatic and economic sanctions offered the ‘best hope’ of persuading Russia to back down and ruled out backing western military action.

He agreed there was a case for looking at whether the UK should boycott the forthcoming G8 summit in Sochi, Russia. ‘All of these options need to be looked at because we’re in such a deeply worrying situation and because we’ve got to protect the sovereignty of Ukraine,’ he said.

‘The international community needs to speak with one voice to say that this is unacceptable, this kind of military incursion is unacceptable. It breaks the terms of the Budapest agreement of 1994 and the diplomatic and economic pressure we can put on Russia is the best hope we have of what everyone wants to see, which is the de-escalation of the crisis.’

Mr Cameron said: ‘There can be no excuse for outside military intervention in Ukraine – a point I made to President Putin when we spoke [on Friday]. Everyone must think carefully about their actions and work to lower, not escalate, tensions. The world is watching.’
