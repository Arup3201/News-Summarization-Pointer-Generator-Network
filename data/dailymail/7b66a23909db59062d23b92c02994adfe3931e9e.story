A grieving mother whose toddler died last year when she was strangled by a window blind cord gave birth to a new baby girl on Tuesday.

Amanda O'Halloran, 23, and her partner Chris Parslow from Tirley, near Gloucester lost their daughter, Sophia, in the freak accident last June.

Sophia was just 17 months old.

But they couple say they have once again found joy since the birth of Isabella, who weighed 6lbs 8oz and bears a striking resemblance to her much mourned sister.

Amanda said that while they would always miss Sophia with all their hearts, Isabella's arrival had brought happiness to the family again.

â€˜We're so happy to be home with our little girl,' she said. 'She's so beautiful and looks just like Sophia.'

Amanda admitted there had been times since Sophia's tragic death when she and Chris had struggled to come to terms with their loss.

'There have been moments when we couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel,' she said.

'Things were so hard when Sophia died I honestly didn't think I could go on. I certainly never thought I'd experience this kind of happiness again.

'Chris and I are both on cloud nine. Now we've got a future.'

Amanda went into labour on Tuesday and Isabella was born at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital just before 8pm that night.

The birth went smoothly and little Isabella was even born in her amniotic sac - rare occurrence seen only in around one in 80,000 babies.

It is believed by many people to be a sign of good luck.

And Amanda certainly believes there was someone watching down on them throughout the birth.

'I am a big believer in fate and the birth went so smoothly I couldn't help but think Sophia was looking down,' said Amanda.

'Isabella was also born in her sac which is very rare and a sign of good luck.

'It is so sad that Isabella will never meet her older sister but I will make sure she knows all about her.

'She will have Sophia's clothes and toys, and we will talk about her every day. I just feel so lucky to be a mum again.

'That was taken away from me before and I feel so happy to have another chance.'

In the wake of Sophia's death, on June 27 last year, Amanda and Chris launched a campaign to ban looped blind cords in the UK.

They have already received widespread support. More than 7,000 people have signed their online petition at epetitions - direct.gov.uk/petitions/5506.
