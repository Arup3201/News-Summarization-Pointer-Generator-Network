It may only be October but on London's Oxford Street Christmas is in full swing and nowhere quite does it like Selfridges.

The world famous department store unveiled its legendary Christmas windows this morning showcasing over a year's worth of hard work, creativity and festive thinking.

And for 2014 for the first time ever, Selfridges gave a lucky few members of the press an exclusive glimpse into the making of Oxford Street's most spectacular windows. FEMAIL headed down last night to discover the method behind the magic.

For the past eight days the department store has been looking rather naked as the the in-house team completed final preparations on the much anticipated displays with the store front hidden behind vinyl stickers. Last night saw the vinyl come down and the lights come up to a small but excited audience.

The theme for this year's Christmas displays evolved from the notion of storytelling. The idea is spread right across the store with book motifs appearing on escalators, counters and hanging from the ceiling.

The window displays themselves take inspiration from traditional fairy tales but, with Selfridges famed for their contemporary touch, each story depicted a modern twist.

Not so ugly duckling: The central model wears a feather style dress from AF Vandevorst

Right from the first unveiling of the 23 windows it was clear that these were not your average bedtime stories. 

A neon pink mannequin dressed in a custom made Peter Pilotto cape stands before you surrounded by woodland animals adorned with an exclusive selection of Erickson Beamon jewellery. At first glance Little Red Riding Hood may not spring to mind but whether you recognise it or not the story has you captivated.

The mannequin stands in front of a hand sculpted tree decorated with laser cut leaves in pinks and golds, the creative team later revealed that there were over 10,000 of the intricate leaves created for the windows.

Other festive themed fables included the store's take on The Ugly Duckling. The centre mannequin who is sat within a rainbow nest and wears a bespoke feather dress from the SS15 AF Vandevorst, seemed anything other than ugly.

Final touches: Even after they have unveiled their window displays there are often some final adjustments to be made

Never ending story: The 23 windows take the team up to 18 months to develop from an idea to display

Destination Christmas: The enormous neon sign is one of the largest to have been featured on the store's canopy

Another highlight that will surely have any festive fashionista swooning was the store's take on Cinderella. Rather than one simple pair of glass slippers, Cinders is surrounded by a plethora of glitzy and metallic heels that will no doubt be the staple footwear of the Christmas party season. Taking centre stage was a very special pair of exclusive Sophia Webster winged heels that are estimated to retail for £800.

In the story of of Rumpelstiltskin, the Princess appears to have woven herself an impressive spider's web with the intricate sparkly golden weave acting as a backdrop for the window. Within the web dozens of golden products dangle from the threads, all exclusive to the store, giving a nod to Selfridges' recent installation of a shop of entirely gold products.

One member of the design team was quick to add that the golden spider web had been a labour of love.

'The woman who crafted the web told me that it had taken her so long that she had got through ten audio books during its making!' he said. 

Look familiar? The Golden Goose has certain traits that are inspired by Harry Gordon Selfridge himself, including the top hat

It wasn't just the spider's web that had been a long time coming. October may seem early enough to start Christmas but for Selfridges themselves seasonal plans start even earlier.

This year's scheme had been in development since November 2013 when the theme was decided on by the creative team.  Linda Hewson, the store's creative director says that thinking so far ahead is always a risk but it is important to just go with it.

'We take inspiration from all over the place. It can be from festivals or fashion shows and we just begin collecting ideas together before deciding on a final theme.

'You do have to take a risk when anticipating trends so far ahead and it does require a lot of foresight.'

Despite having to produce the theme so far ahead, Linda says that they rarely change anything once they have started planning.

'We do have to tweak a few minor things if suddenly discover that something isn't going to work in the window but on the whole we don't tend to change very much once the design is decided on. You just have to go with it.'

Linda says that for the Christmas windows they wanted it to be festive but, as always, there had to be a twist.

'This year is slightly more traditional than some of our previous displays' says Linda 'But at the same time it has this hyper-realistic feel it is very other-worldly and all of the colours make it almost like a kaleidoscope.'

Hannah Emslie, the Creative Windows Manager at the store says that Christmas gives them a lot more potential to be more extravagant when it comes to windows.

'Because our windows are South facing it means that Christmas is the only time that we can really play with light' says Hannah adding 'Lights are just completely wasted in the summer so we have to just rule them out, so it is really fun to be able to play with them at Christmas.' 

The scale of which Selfridges does Christmas is just phenomenal. This year alone there are 197,000 baubles, 1,005 Christmas trees and not forgetting the 75 metres of fake hair to create Rapunzel's tresses!

The largest installation by far is the decoration for the canopy that over hangs the main entrance to the beauty hall. Said to be one of the store's largest canopy displays it will see 18-20 metres of fairy lights and over a kilometre of neon lighting.

Bruno Barba, Senior Brand PR Manager for Selfridges, added that the canopy will have one very special guest added this year.

'The main feature will be the Golden Goose. He will be wearing a top hat and a monocle which is a sort of tongue in cheek reminisce towards Harry Gordan Selfridge.'

Bruno added that the heavy sprucing that the store use on the windows and canopy is unlike any that yous see in the UK.

'No one does sprucing to this scale' says Bruno. 'You see it everywhere in New York but I have never seen it so thick in any other department store in Britain.'

In terms of competition Selfridges are way ahead of their competitors Harrods, Liberty's and Harvey Nichols who aren't due to unveil their windows until early November.

Grand finale: A member of the production team adds a final lick of paint to the Golden Goose on the store's canopy 

'It's not intentional' adds Bruno 'We pick a date to unveil every year and we just always end up being the first ones. This is an understanding that all of the stores have.' 

If you think the unveiling all went without a hitch you would be mistaken. Within minutes of removing the vinyl the creative team were rushing to adjust minor details in the window to ensure perfection.

Hannah says that whether there are faults in the window or not they try and adjust them over the festive period to keep their passers by interested.

'Our audience is so vast. Yes, we have people who come actively to see the windows but then we have the people who walk past everyday or stand at the bus stop and we want to keep them interested.'

Despite the endless effort that goes into the windows not only in the run up but right over the festive season Hannah seems pleased with her work.

'The windows are always a risk' she says 'But if you really believe in something and it's a good idea, it is always worth it.'
