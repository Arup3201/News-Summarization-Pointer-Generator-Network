Thrill seekers at the Royal Melbourne Show endured an hour-long wait atop a roller coaster on Thursday after the ride broke down.

The passengers endured a tense hour when several carriages on the 16 metre tall Tapain roller coaster ground to a halt in the middle of the ride, shortly after 1pm.

Workers tried frantically to free the eight trapped riders, including three children, for over an hour before the ride started working again.

A statement from the the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria (RASV) confirmed that the Taipan ride stopped twice today at the Royal Melbourne Show, but was adamant that 'at no stage was the safety of patrons compromised'.

The statement continued, 'The RASV has followed its robust processes and worked with the ride operator and the appropriate authorities, including WorkSafe, which have found no fault with the ride and have confirmed the Taipan is safe to continue operation.' 

It is not clear what caused the incident, and while no one was injured, WorkSafe is allegedly still investigating the events which resulted in the break down of the ride.
