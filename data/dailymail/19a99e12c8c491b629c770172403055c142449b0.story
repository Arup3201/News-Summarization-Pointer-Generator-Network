The photographer is a weird employment expert having spent over fifteen years of work on the subject of unusual occupations.

The
 pictures feature a female men's underwear designer, a male tampon 
tester, not to mention a female condom tester and a male bra designer.

Other jobs are so unique that only one person performs them or testing jobs with the nose, the mouth or the touch.

Nancy
 said: 'The book's inspiration came from an odd-looking fellow at the 
Hollywood Race Track whose job it was to time the horse races.

'Thinking up other odd jobs came from research, word-of-mouth and luck.

As
 it was a personal project not funded by anyone else I tracked down odd 
jobs all over the USA staying with friends and grouping odd jobs in 
cities together.

'Many of the jobs were chosen with a twist of humour.

'Of all the jobs I photographed, I would love to do the Mermaid one as I am a swimmer myself.'

Nancy shot all her subjects on location, processing and printing herself.

These pictures come from her two books, Odd Jobs and Odder Jobs published in 2002 and 2006.

Nancy has huddled underneath a trailer as hundreds of cows were artificially inseminated by a more-than-willing man and watched as a museum worker painstakingly dusted dinosaur bones.

Her unusual subjects could not be 
further removed from her own working life as a young portrait 
photographer, capturing household names such as Andy Warhol, Woody Allen
 and Whoopi Goldberg.

But in 1989, after spotting a 
race-timer at the Hollywood Race track in California, Miss Schiff became
 fascinated with those who leave their house every morning to thrust 
themselves into the most unconventional working scenarios.

After
 three years of travelling and research since the inception of her idea,
 she had amassed 15 photographs, which she bundled into a drawer.

Head for heights: Her adventures saw her scaling Mount Rushmore to 
follow a Presidential crack-filler, as he perilously dangled over the 
rock face, making sure that time didn't take its toll on four of 
America's most famous sculpted faces

Semen collector: One of the more unusual jobs was when she photographed a woman who collects bull's semen for a living

The bizarre shots sat dormant for 
nearly five years before somebody expressed an interest and the idea for
 a book became a reality.

There have now been two volumes of her images - Odd Jobs, released in 2002, and 
2006’s follow-up Odder Jobs.

She
 describes her motivation for taking the pictures as a ‘fascination with
 American humour’, which shines through in many of her photographs.

Pulling
 ideas from newspaper articles, magazines and talking to people about 
the strangest jobs they knew, she eventually built up an impressive, if 
baffling, portfolio.

She
 found herself particularly interested in jobs involving ‘sex reversal’,
 evidenced by the male tampon tester or female who designs men’s 
underwear.

Despite 
spending a large part of her working life meeting people because of the 
strange ways they earned a living, Miss Schiff says she was struck by 
the ‘normality’ of those she met.

While
 some may expect an occupation as an animal keeper at the Playboy 
mansion to go hand-in-hand with unorthodoxy, Miss Schiff says: I was 
struck by how they were all quite normal – and all the people I met 
seemed to enjoy their jobs.’

She adds: ‘Some of them even invented their own jobs – such as the sandcastle instructor – which I found quite charming’.

Now
 living in Italy, ‘walking around and taking pictures of things’, the 
photographer’s career often leant towards an unorthodox subject matter.

She has previously undertaken projects photographing twins and octogenarians.

Whether dealing with notable figures such as literary giant Arthur Miller, or the owner of a pet cemetery, she said she was always equally inspired – driven by the lure of turning up on a job and ‘not knowing what to expect’.

Describing how she picked suitable subjects for her odd jobs, she says: ‘My criteria for odd was simple: There had to be a twist of some sort.

‘Perhaps there was a gender reversal for example, a male bra designer or a young man testing tampons.

‘In fact, ‘testing’ professions 
became a whole chapter. Or perhaps the job dealt with death or a 
forbidden but funny subject—or maybe the job was performed by only one 
person on earth.’

Her 
stylised shots, carrying an otherworldliness befitting her subjects, 
were always taken in black and white, which she describes as the 
‘colours of photography’.

She
 describes the knife-thrower’s assistant as the ‘strangest’ profession, 
saying she ‘just couldn’t believe anyone would do that’.

Undeterred she had a go herself, describing the experience as ‘scary’, but adding the caveat: ‘He was obviously very good.’
