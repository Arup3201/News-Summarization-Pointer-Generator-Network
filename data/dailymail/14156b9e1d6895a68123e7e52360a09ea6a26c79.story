Sci-fi film Minority Report introduced the idea that large, vertical screens could one day be controlled using just gestures.

But while the film was a work of fiction set 40 years in the future, a university in Bristol has taken the technology one step closer to reality. 

The MisTable features a tabletop, touchscreen display surround by a 'curtain of mist'.

This curtain is made of fog screens that work in a similar way to touch displays, letting users move images around and manipulate their orientation within the smoke.

The MisTable features a tabletop, touchscreen display surrounded by a 'curtain of mist'.

This
 curtain is made of fog screens that work in a similar way to touch 
displays, letting users move images around and manipulate their 
orientation within the smoke.

These images can then be pushed 
through the fog screens and onto the tabletop display, where they are 
controlled using traditional touchscreen gestures.

For
 example, a designer could rotate a virtual model, change its tilt and 
appearance on the fog screen before pushing it on the touchscreen and 
saving it.

These images can then be pushed through the fog screens and onto the tabletop display, where they are then controlled using traditional touch gestures.

For example, a designer could rotate a virtual model and change it's tilt and appearance on the fog screen before pushing it back onto the touchscreen to save or print it.

Alternatively, a group of people could work on the same design project by picking up various models and placing them on their personal fog screens.

They could then each edit the individual parts before pushing them back onto the completed group image.

MisTable was created by Professor Sriram Subramanian and Dr Diego Martinez Plasencia from the University of Bristol's Department of Computer Science.

As well as being 'reach-through', the screens are also see-through meaning users can see both the item the y are manipulating, as well as any relevant items on the touchscreen.

The researchers said personal fog screens allow a range 
of 'customisations and novel interactions' such as showing 2D personal 
content on the screen and 3D content above the tabletop.

Professor Subramanian added: 'MisTable broadens the potential of conventional tables in many novel and unique ways.

This diagram explains the different features of the MisTable. Professor Subramanian from the university said the MisTable could support new forms of interaction and collaboration in the future. The technology will be unveiled at the ACM CHI international conference later this month

'The personal screen provides direct line of sight and access to the different interaction spaces.

'Users can be aware of each other's actions and can easily switch between interacting with the personal screen to the tabletop surface or the interaction section.

'This allows users to break in or out of shared tasks and switch between individual and group work.'

He said that MisTable could support new forms of interaction and collaboration in the future.

The technology will be unveiled at the ACM CHI international conference later this month

It features a tabletop, touchscreen display surrounded by a ‘curtain of mist’

This mist is made of fog screens that act in a similar way to touchscreens

For example, items can be controlled and moved around the mist

Pushing the item through the mist transfers it to the touchscreen display
