Jeremy Clarkson's 'tasteless' antics have sparked fury at the Indian High Commission, which has written to the BBC demanding they apologise for a Top Gear Christmas special.

The controversial star caused outrage with an episode set in India in which he strips to his boxer shorts in front of his hosts and hangs offensive banners on trains.

Staff at the High Commission complained that the programme was 'replete with cheap jibes, tasteless humour and lacked cultural sensitivity.'

They fired off emails and letters to the show's producer, Chris Hale - copying in BBC director general Mark Thompson - expressing 'deep disappointment' at the content of Top Gear: India Special.

A spokesman for the High Commission said
it had received hundreds of complaints after the special was repeated 
twice over Christmas.

Diplomats had consented to the programme being shot in the country after receiving a letter from Mr Hale describing it as a 'light-hearted road trip'.

But the consulate complained in a letter that the content of the show was 'in breach of this agreement' and said the BBC would need to 'assuage the hurt sentiments of a huge number of people'.

The incident is the latest in a string of gaffes by the badly behaved Clarkson.

Just yesterday he claimed that Kent was full of immigrants from the Sangatte refugee camp in France.

Earlier this week, he used his newspaper column to compare the Morecambe Bay tragedy in which 23 Chinese migrant workers died with synchronised swimming.

Back in November, the motormouth presenter horrified public sector workers by saying strikers should be shot.

Embarrassingly for Britain, David Cameron features at the start
of the Top Gear special, waving to Clarkson and telling him to 'stay away from
India'.

The BBC admitted it received 23 complaints after the programme, which remains available online.

It confirmed it had received a letter from the Indian High Commission and said it would respond in due course.

Clarkson, 51, is one of 
the BBC's highest paid stars, having earned Â£2.14million from his 
involvement in the Top Gear last year.

But the wayward star may caused serious damage to the broadcaster and its image abroad.

'We conveyed our disappointment,' said
a minister from the High Commission. 'The show was crass and 
misunderstanding of Indian culture.

'Lots of people have complained to us, both Indian and British. They are deeply offended and expect us to do something.

'We don't think this is the Government's view, but we want the BBC to stop repeating this programme and take action.'

Shocking: Again the carriages divided to display an obscene slogan

The outline of the Top Gear special said the show would involve 'spontaneous interaction between the presenters and their environment'.

It claimed that the key aspects would be 'beautiful scenery, busy city scenes, local charm and colour', emphasising India's 'local car culture'.

Instead, Clarkson and his co-presenters drove around in a Jaguar with a toilet fixed to the boot.

Showing off the car's unusual modification as he drove around the slums, Clarkson boasted: 'This is perfect for India because everyone who comes here gets the trots.'

They also hung up banners that read 'British IT is good for your company' and 'Eat English muffins', which turned into offensive messages when the carriages pulled them apart.

It is not the first time the show has run into trouble after venturing abroad. The BBC was forced to apologise to the Mexican ambassador last year after derogatory remarks about 'Mexican characteristics' made by Clarkson and his co-hosts.

Asked whether Mr Cameron regretted his involvement in the programme, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'As you know, the BBC are able to film in Downing Street as are other broadcast companies. They were in the street and he was leaving for an event.

'The Government is not responsible for editorial decisions made by the BBC or any media organisation. This is a matter for the BBC - I don't speak for the BBC.'

Asked why Mr Cameron had written a letter to the programme which was read out at its opening, the spokesman said: 'When people write to the Prime Minister, or indeed any other Government minister, it is customary to reply. He got a letter. He replied.'

From Chris Hale, Top Gear producer, to Indian High Commission, London

'Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May will travel across India in three cars filming a light hearted road trip focusing on the journey and the inevitable idiosyncrasies of the cars they will drive, as well as the country and scenery we see along the way.

'There will be spontaneous interaction between the presenters and their environment, and potentially people they meet along the way. This will be in an incidental manner, not interviews.

'Key ingredients of what we film will be beautiful scenery, busy city scenes, local charm and colour within these locations, areas to illustrate the local car culture that exists in India.'6 January 2012

'The programme was replete with cheap jibes, tasteless humour and lacked cultural sensitivity. This is not clearly what we expect of the BBC. I write this to convey our deep disappointment over the documentary for its content and the tone of the presentation.

'You are clearly in breach of the agreement that you had entered into, completely negating our constructive and proactive facilitation. We strongly protest and expect the BBC to make amends, especially to assuage the hurt sentiments of a large number of people.'
