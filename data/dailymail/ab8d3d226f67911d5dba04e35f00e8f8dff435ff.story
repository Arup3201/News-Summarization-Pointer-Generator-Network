Hundreds of items that were left behind by forgetful travellers at Indianapolis International Airport in the US are being given a new life.

Everything from a Native American headdress and football nets to an assortment of gadgets and jewellery will be sold to the highest bidders at an auction next week.

Up to 2,000 items are up for grabs with all the proceeds going to the Indianapolis Airport Authority’s general fund to help to offset its operating costs.

Unclaimed goods will be sold alongside surplus aviation equipment that is no longer used.

The last auction two years ago raised over £150,000.

Carlo Bertolini, spokesman for the Indianapolis Airport Authority, said the vast majority of items turned in to the airport’s lost-and-found program are returned to their owners.

And the belongings that don’t find their way home must meet certain criteria before they go on the auction block, said Mark Pike, advertising manager with Key Auctioneers, which is handling the sale.

First, the Indianapolis Airport Authority must exhaust every possible avenue to find the owner. The item also must have gone unclaimed for a minimum of 30 days.

However, most objects sit in storage for several months before they are sold to the public. The auction does not include items confiscated at TSA security checkpoints.

The vast majority of items turned in to the airport’s lost-and-found program are returned to their owners.

Mr Pike said police check the airport’s lost-and-found storage when they receive a report of property that has disappeared at the airport.

Unclaimed baggage auctions are held in the UK, but lost-and-found policies vary by from airport to airport.

At London Luton Airport, all unclaimed items are donated to Sue Ryder, its charity partner, after sitting in storage for a minimum of three months.

The most common items that are lost at Luton are mobile phones, belts and glasses, a spokesman told MailOnline Travel.

Others have hired external companies to handle lost property.

Heathrow, for example, employs Bagport, which lists the items on an online registry and charges an administration fee of up to £20 when the found item is collected.

The storage fee is higher for larger items such as bicycles, surf boards, televisions or suitcases.
