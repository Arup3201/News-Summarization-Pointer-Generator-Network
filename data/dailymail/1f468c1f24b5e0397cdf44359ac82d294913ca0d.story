People living on the streets have been going without meals as greedy backpackers take advantage of homeless food services.

Some charities, including the Salvation Army, have been forced to stop visiting some homeless hotspots throughout Melbourne with their food vans because of a surge in stingy tourists lining up for a free meal.

Major Brendan Nottle from the Salvation Army said they offered food to anyone who showed up and had actually run out of food a few times due to the number of backpackers.

'They were often wearing the latest hiking boots and it left the homeless people feeling intimidated,' Mr Nottle told Daily Mail Australia.

'We tried to talk to the backpackers but sometimes there was a language barrier. Other times they understood but used to show up anyway.

'I think they just thought it was free food, but it was pretty obvious that the people there were struggling (financially). 

'We never refuse food because you never fully know the circumstances, but we had to stop going to specific spots because of the backpackers... homeless people started dropping off from the outreach van because they didn't feel comfortable.'

The Salvation Army decided to stop visiting certain places with the food van and instead keep its Bourke Street welfare hub open later to encourage the homeless community to come inside for a meal.

They started the Bella’s Friendship Club at the Bourke Street premises to help isolated people interact with others.  

'It's given us an opportunity to rework what we do here in Melbourne. From 6-8pm on Monday to Friday homeless people gather together (at the welfare hub) in a dignified way,' Mr Nottle said.

'We get about 70-80 people each night and they now get to sit down and have a proper meal with proper cutlery.

'Then we take the van out later than we used to and visit isolated areas identied by police or council as having rough sleepers.'

Mr Nottle said the number of backpackers coming to food vans in Melbourne had increased in the past few years and suspects they used social media to alert people about how to get free meals.

The number of backpackers caused the charity to run out of food on several occasions
