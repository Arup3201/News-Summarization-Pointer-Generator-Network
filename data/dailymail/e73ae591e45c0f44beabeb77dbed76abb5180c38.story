Lindsay Lohan appeared in a Los Angeles court this morning for a brief probation hearing where she was lauded with praise.

The 25-year-old actress, who arrived back just in the nick of time from Hawaii last night, turned up wearing a gaping white cardigan top, which exposed her cleavage, teamed with champagne-coloured trousers and heels.

But it appeared the starlet may have over indulged on her mini-break as she was looking a little bloated and sporting a double chin - something the cameras didn't happen to catch during her recent nude Playboy photoshoot.

While her court dates usually see her admonished - today golden girl LiLo was given the thumbs up for completing her probation requirements early over the past month.

Judge Stephanie Sautner - apparently 
feeling the festive spirit - told Lohan she was pleased with her 
progress and told her to keep it up.

'You are doing well and I'd like to see it continue,' the Los Angeles Superior Court judge told her.

'The morgue seems to be pleased - as pleased as a morgue can be,' she added.

Judge Sautner also chirped: 'I think 
she likes coming here and seeing me,' in a comment to Lohan's lawyer 
Shawn Chapman Holley, who asked if Lindsay needed to return to court 
next month if she completes her next stint of probation requirements 
early.

Lohan will indeed have to show her 
face again because, as the judge put it: 'She won't complete her 
probation otherwise,' prompting Lohan to chuckle.

The actress - who features nude in the
upcoming issue of Playboy magazine - has been ordered to complete 
another 12 days of community service and four therapy sessions ahead of 
her next court date on January 17.

Judge Sautner told Lohan that he 
recent trip to Hawaii was perfectly acceptable because it was to 
celebrate her sister Ali's birthday, who turns 18 later this month.

Lohan
has progressed ahead of schedule with her community service and was 
told that she can now travel for pleasure whenever she has completed her
12 days of service she is slated to do per month.

Otherwise Lohan is
only allowed to travel to see her family on holidays and special 
occasions with the approval of her probation officer.

'In any month 
you complete your twelve days early you can travel for pleasure, to 
see her family to not see her family - to go to a spa or whatever.

'The holidays are coming up so you can travel to see your family.

'But travel for pleasure or fun is only allowed after you've completed the 12 days.'

Lohan was ordered last month to spend 30 days in jail after she admitted 
violating her probation in a DUI case and another involving the theft of
a necklace from a Venice jewellery store.

Due largely to jail 
overcrowding, she served only about five hours at the Century Regional 
Detention Facility in Lynwood, California.

Relief: While Lohan is usually admonished at her court appearances, today was a different matter and the actress could hardly contain her happiness as the Judge Sautner told her to keep up the good work

Light moment: Lindsay covers her face after letting out a laugh when the judge joked that Lindsay will have to return to court next week because otherwise 'she won't complete her probation'. Sautner added that Lindsay likes coming to see her in court

Lohan admitted she had violated probation by failing to show up for community-service appointments and therapy sessions.

Judge Sautner technically sentenced 
the actress to 300 days behind bars but only required her to serve 30 
days.

The remaining 270 days of the sentence will be stayed as long 
as Lohan adheres to a specific schedule of community service work and 
therapy sessions, Sautner ruled.

Included in that schedule was a 
requirement for her to perform 12 days of community service at the Los 
Angeles County morgue and attend four psychotherapy sessions prior to 
today's hearing.

She will now have until Jan 17 to serve another 12 days at the morgue and attend four more therapy sessions.

If
she remains on track, Lohan will then have until February 15 to complete 
another 12 days at the morgue and four more therapy sessions.

After that, she will have until March 29 to perform 17 more days at the morgue and six more therapy sessions.

If
Lohan sticks to the schedule, her probation in the 2007 DUI case will 
terminate at the end of March, and her probation in the Venice theft 
case will be downgraded to summary, non-supervised probation, Sautner 
said.

Lohan pleaded no contest May 11 to a misdemeanour grand theft 
charge involving a necklace priced at $2,500 pilfered from a Venice 
jewellery store.

Time for the crime: The probation stems from a 2007 
drink-driving conviction and a jewellery theft conviction earlier this 
year

She was placed on three years probation and ordered to
spend 120 days in jail and complete the 480 hours of community service 
to which she had been previously sentenced for violating her probation 
in a 2007 misdemeanour DUI case.

Lohan was ordered to have her 480 
hours of community service completed by April 2012, with 360 hours at 
the Downtown Women's Center and another 120 hours at the county morgue.

However, her attendance was so sporadic at the Skid Row center that 
shelter officials terminated her from the community-service program 
there.

That prompted Sautner to revoke the actress' probation. She 
later ordered that Lohan perform all of her community service work at 
the morgue.

Jetting back: Lindsay arriving back to Los Angeles last night following mini break in Hawaii

Since her last court hearing, the Freaky Friday star posed for a much-publicized photo spread in Playboy.

Pictures from the photo shoot leaked online, prompting the magazine to 
move up the release date of the Lohan issue.

Lohan made news earlier this week 
when her purse was stolen while she was vacationing in Hawaii - a trip 
that was previously approved by her probation officer.

Lohan's purse was recovered, but an estimated $10,000 she was carrying in it was missing.
