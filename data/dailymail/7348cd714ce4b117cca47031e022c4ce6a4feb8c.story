She held out valiantly for four years but this is Enid Jones’s beloved terraced home being flattened to make way for a superstore.

And her heartbreak has been compounded after it was suggested yesterday that she could have lost her home for nothing because Tesco might never build the store.

The 59-year-old grandmother of two became the unlikely heroine in a battle against the multi-million-pound supermarket chain.

Destroyed: Enid Jones's house, which she lived in for a decade, is demolished to make way for a Tesco superstore and car park that might not ever be built

Distraught: Mrs Jones pictured along her street in Aberystwth, Wales, before the demolition started. Her sister, Bethan, said she did not watch her house being destroyed, and may never go to the site again

Finished: A digger rests on the rubble of Mrs Jones's former home as the last pieces of the roof are torn down to make way for a multi-storey shopping complex

She made a stand against plans to turn her street in Aberystwyth, west Wales, into a multi-storey ‘shopping park’.

Mrs Jones flatly refused to budge from the three-bedroom home she described as ‘her castle’, resisting developers’ generous offers and hiring a lawyer to fight her case.

Having persuaded all of Mrs Jones’s 11 neighbours to sell their homes, the developers eventually applied for a compulsory purchase order from Ceredigion Council.

The order was granted and last Friday a wrecking ball flattened her home in Glyndwr Road to make way for a 25,000sq ft Tesco, a 36,000sq ft Marks & Spencer and a 550-space car park.

Fight: After a four-year legal battle with Tesco, in which all 11 of her neighbours sold up, Mrs Jones was forced out using a compulsory purchase order (pictured, Mrs Jones after a hearing to discuss the sale)

Coming down: Despite the demolition being forced through, Tesco has recently declared it is scrapping 49 new projects amid financial woes. It is not known if this is among them

Sad: Mrs Jones, 59, who has been left living with her elderly mother while she seeks compensation from the council, is said to be 'devastated' at the loss of her home

The retired receptionist, who had been there for ten years, is said to be ‘devastated’. She is living with her elderly mother while she seeks compensation from the council.

Her sister, Bethan said: ‘She was very low on the day that they demolished her house. She didn’t go down to see them doing it and don’t think she will ever go back.’

But some locals have cast doubt on whether the scheme will go-ahead citing Tesco’s financial troubles. In January this year the chain announced plans to axe 43 stores across the UK and shelve 49 new projects in an attempt to turn around its fortunes.

Aberystwyth town councillor Mair Benjamin said: ‘There is a real chance this complex might not go ahead. 

Before: This is what the road in Aberystwyth, mid-Wales, looked like before the bulldozers rolled in

After: An artist's impression of what the site will look like after construction is complete, if it ever happens

Denial: Tesco denied the building work would be cancelled, saying the store was set to open its doors in summer next year, with a Marks and Spencer following in December 2016

'Tesco have already halted a number of projects and we have been watching their share price and it isn’t looking good. It would be disgraceful if all this has happened for nothing.’ 

But developer Chalverton, which has spearheaded the scheme, denied any plans to shelve it, saying that everyone involved was ‘100 per cent committed’.

It said the Tesco store will open its doors in summer next year with Marks & Spencer following in December 2016. 

Tesco said: ‘We still want to build the store and we know many local people are looking forward to it opening.’ Marks & Spencer said: ‘We plan to open a store in the development next year.’
