A camera shy canine may have dashed its breeder's hopes of being a shoe-in for a prize at Crufts today when it turned pooch in boots and began sniffing out more than just the competition.

Other dog owners were relying on humorous bibs to get their prize pooches noticed by the judges, while some opted to wheel their animals to the venue so as not to get their paws wet.

The pampering continued inside, as proud owners put the finishing touches to their dogs' hairdos in anticipation of day two of the world-renowned show.
