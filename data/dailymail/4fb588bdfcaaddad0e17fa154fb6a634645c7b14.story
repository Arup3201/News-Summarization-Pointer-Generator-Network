The first full moon of the year - known as the Wolf Moon - lit up the night's sky last night.

While much of the UK was shrouded in mist and cloud, elsewhere in the world stargazers were treated to clear views of the Moon's pockmarked surface.

January's full moon became known as the Wolf Moon due to the howling of hungry wolves that often accompanied it at the height of winter.

This moon traces a path that takes it high into the sky, unlike the trajectory of the sun during the short winter days, due to the tilt of the Earth.

Some of the best views were seen in Los Angeles, California, but in the north of England, like Sunderland, in Tyne and Wear, clear skies also allowed some to see the moon glow a rich orange as it rose in the sky.

It is not just werewolves that have sleepless nights when there is a full moon.

Research has shown that many people get less overall sleep and reduced levels of deep sleep when there is a full moon in the sky.

New research shows it’s not just werewolves and vampires who get little or no sleep on night’s like tomorrow when there is a full moon.

The study, led by experts at the University of Toronto in Canada, that on nights when there is a full moon it takes some people nearly twice as long to fall asleep - up to an hour - as on darker nights.

Women took an average of 52 minutes to nod off, compared to 25 to 30 minutes when there was no full moon.

Men took up to 60 minutes, compared with half an hour at other times.

For centuries, there has been a widespread belief that the moon exerts a powerful effect on human sleep patterns, as well as health and behaviour. 

In South Africa the National Sea Rescue Institute issued a warning of strong rip currents off its coast as the full moon brought a powerful spring tide.

Full Moon parties in Koh Phangan, Thailand, were also expected to attract more than 40,000 holiday makers.

This year's Wolf Moon, sometimes called the Old Moon, also coincided with the Earth reaching perihelion, the closest point to the sun in its orbit.

This brought the Earth just 91.4 million miles from the sun, making the full moon appear slightly brighter.

However, the bright glare from the sunlight reflected from the lunar surface meant the annual Quadrantids meteor shower, which peaked in the early hours of Sunday morning, was difficult to see.

The full moon and the meteor shower are the first of a number of astronomical events due to delight astronomers in January.

Comet Lovejoy is also visible in the northern hemisphere for the first time since it was discovered in August by the Australian amateur astronomer Terry Lovejo.

It will be closest to the Earth on 7 January and should be visible in binoculars for around a week.

Three planets will line up in the southwest of the sky just after sunset on 10 January with both Venus and Mercury visible alongside each other and Mars further to the left.

The first full moon to occur in January is known as the Wolf Moon as it was often accompanied by howling in North America from hungry wolf packs as they searched for food during the cold, lean days of winter

Venus will be particularly bright in January and will make Mercury alongside it easy to spot in the evenings

A good view of Saturn will also materialise to the left of the waning crescent Moon on 16 January.

Views of the planet Jupiter are also expected to be among the highlights in the night's sky this month.

The middle of January will enjoy several moonless hours each evening and will give astronomers a good view of the stars that are normally drowned out by the light from the sun.

Among these could be the red star Antares will sit alongside Saturn as the two brightest points on the southeastern horizon.

The constellation of Auriga, the charioteer, will be high in the south, with the brightest star Capella, nearly completely overhead.
