These shocking images show the brutal moment two pigs fight to the death in front of cheering spectators at a crowded stadium.

The two desperate animals can be seen circling each other before they are forced into battle by being prodded and poked with long sticks by their trainers.

As the two male beasts clash, they headbutt each other and attempt to bring their rival down by biting their neck.
