Julia Bradbury is pregnant again at the age of 44, three years after the difficult pregnancy of her first child.

She had longed for a sibling for her son Zephyr but, in her forties and diagnosed with endometriosis, she had accepted that this may never happen.

However, yesterday the TV presenter announced she was ‘ecstatically happy to be pregnant’ following a course of IVF. ‘It’s no secret that our son Zephyr was a longed-for baby, and we are thrilled at the prospect of having a brother or sister for him,’ she said.

‘As an older mum I feel incredibly lucky. I’ve reached the three-month mark and am keeping as fit and healthy as possible’.

The number of women giving birth in their forties is nearly double that of 1990 and four times that of the 1980s.

The rise has been put down to the number of women who now go to university and start a career before having children. According to the Office for National Statistics, in 2012, there were 28,714 pregnancies in England and Wales where the mother was over the age of 40.

In the same year, the number of mothers over 40 overtook teenage pregnancies for the first time.

The Countryfile presenter, nicknamed the walking man’s crumpet after all the outdoor TV programmes she has presented, had her first child at the age of 41, two years after she began dating property developer Gerard Cunningham, 55.

She was far from sure she could ever have children. As well as being over 40, she had also been diagnosed with endometriosis, a painful condition affecting the womb.

When it came to the birth itself, there were further problems when she was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia which, if left untreated, can be dangerous to both mother and baby. The birth, an experience she has described as ‘traumatic towards the end’, had to be induced.

However, at the end of last year, Miss Bradbury said: ‘I would love Zeph to have a brother or sister but I am 43 and have to be realistic.’

Her new primetime ITV show The Wonder of Britain will be aired early next year.
