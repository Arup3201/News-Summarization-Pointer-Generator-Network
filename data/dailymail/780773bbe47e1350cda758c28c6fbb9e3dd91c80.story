Police have launched a major investigation after the bodies of a father and his two sons were found at a flat.

Officers were called to the scene after paramedics made the grim discovery in Tidworth, Wiltshire.

Inside they found the body of Graham Gordon Anderson, 36, in one room and those of the children, aged three and 11, in another.

It is understood an ambulance was called just after 1pm on Saturday after someone claimed to have seen a dead man inside the flat and that two children were also there.

Police said they are treating the deaths as suspicious but are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.

The property has since been cordoned off and a full forensic examination is being undertaken by crime scene investigators and a pathologist.

The Wiltshire coroner has been informed and post-mortem examinations are to be conducted.

The police investigation is being led by Detective Chief Inspector Ian Saunders, of the Brunel Major Crime Investigation Team.

An incident room has been set up at Marlborough police station.

Det Ch Insp Saunders said: 'I am extremely keen for any sightings of Graham Anderson with the two children between Saturday 25 August and Saturday 1 September.

'He was a regular bus user and I now need to trace his movements, and those of the boys during the week leading up to the discovery of their bodies at lunchtime yesterday.'

Earlier, Det Ch Insp Saunders said detectives were 'unsure' what had happened before the three died

'At
this early stage we cannot be sure what has led up to this terrible 
incident, but I can say that we are treating the tragic deaths of the 
two children as suspicious,' he said.

Mark of respect: Residents left flowers at the scene of the tragedy

'I am not looking for anyone else at this time in connection with this incident.

'The mother of the children has been informed and we are seeking to contact other family members.

'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have died.'

The alarm was raised yesterday afternoon by Mr Anderson's landlady, who was due to show prospective new tennants around his flat in Auchinleck House, Sidbury Heights.

To her horror, she discovered the bodies of the father and his sons.

Det Ch Insp Saunders said the case was an extremely tragic one.

'I can say that we are not looking any third party involvement,' he added.

Since then, police have launched a major investigation - carrying out extensive door-to-door inquiries in the area.

Initial information revealed the last known activity in the flat was on Thursday morning.

However, a key piece in the jigsaw will be the results of the post-mortem examinations.

This evening, an examination of Mr Anderson's body is being conducted at Flax Bourton near Bristol.

Tests on the bodies of the two boys are likely to be conducted over the next couple of days in Southampton.

A specialist team of officers has also been assigned to support shell-shocked family members.

Among them, is the boys' mother - who is said to have separated from their father.

'It has clearly been a shock for her to find out and she is very distressed," said Det Chief Insp Saunders. 'But she will be given the best possible support we can provide.'

The tragedy has also sent shockwaves through the rural town of Tidworth and the Sidbury Heights estate - which is home to many families.

Neighbours have continued to leave flowers, soft toys and messages of condolence outside the building's main entrance.

As police staged a press conference outside the house this afternoon,

Superintendent Matt Pullen told the gathered crowd: 'Obviously the deaths has caused shock in the local community.

'Our heartfelt sympathies go to the families of the deceased.

'Local police are intimately involved with the inquiry to ensure we provide an appropriate presence and reassurance at this difficult time.'Anyone who has information that may assist police is asked to call Wiltshire Police on 101 and ask for the incident room, or if they wish to remain anonymous they can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
