Gareth Southgate has urged his England Under 21 squad to use John Stones as an example of the rewards possible for young players in the national system.

Southgate’s group for tonight’s Euro 2015 qualifier with Wales is inexperienced for this level, as Roy Hodgson has taken some key figures.

Everton defender Stones is on stand-by for the World Cup while Raheem Sterling and Luke Shaw are in his 23-man squad for Brazil.

Moving up: Southgate wants England's under-21 players to use John Stones as an example

Pleasure: Southgate, whose team are sailing through qualifying, said it was a pleasure to work with Stones

Butland; Browning, Keane, Dier, Garbutt; Chalobah, Ward-Prowse; Ince, McEachran, Redmond; Ings.

TV: LIVE on Sky Sports 1 from 7pm  (kick-off 7.30pm).

While 
Liverpool winger Sterling and Southampton left-back Shaw have not played
 for the Under 21s since November, Stones has been an integral figure 
and was outstanding in the 1-0 win over Wales in March.

Stones
 would have played in the return fixture in Swansea then gone on to the 
Toulon Tournament, and while Southgate is disappointed to lose a player 
of his quality he believes the 19-year-old is a success story for what 
the Football Association are trying to achieve.

‘John
 has emerged from our programme of the Under 20s World Cup last year and
 been outstanding for us this season,’ said Southgate. ‘His composure on
 the ball is fantastic, we’re looking for defenders to play out.

‘His
 experience at full back probably helped that. Like any centre back he 
will have to learn the defensive positioning but nothing fazes him. 
Raheem and Luke we have had less of. They are in their first team anyway
 and it’s been a different process.

Commanding: Stones' form for Everton has been superb, and resulted in an England call-up

‘But
 the one that most pleased me was John. It is probably one that for club
 and country worked really nicely. The relationship we had with Roberto 
(Martinez) and Graeme (Jones) hopefully played a part in that.

‘In
 the end it is down to the player and his fantastic attitude and his 
desire to keep learning. I have spoken with him and I expect he will go 
on to Miami with the seniors and then see what happens. It is a pleasure
 to work with boys like him.’

England
 have breezed through the qualification process so far under Southgate 
and they only need four points from their final three away fixtures 
against Wales, Lithuania and Moldova to finish top of Group 1.

‘We
 have to just focus on winning the game and playing in the style we want
 to,’ said Southgate. ‘We had a tough game against Wales in Derby. The 
way they set up made it difficult for us.’
