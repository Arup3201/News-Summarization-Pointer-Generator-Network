It is a line-up like no other... from a Second World War fighter pilot and a famous comedian to A-list actors and renowned academics.

Geoffrey Wellum, 93, who was the youngest Spitfire pilot in the Battle of Britain, will make a rare public appearance at the Chalke Valley History Festival, sponsored by the Daily Mail.

On the bill are Al Murray, known for his Pub Landlord act, actor Damian Lewis, War Horse author Michael Morpurgo, journalist Kate Adie, Ian Hislop, the editor of Private Eye, and Jeremy Paxman.

Guests:  Spitfire pilot Geoffrey Wellum is to speak at the Chalke Valley History Festival about his war service while Al Murray is to deliver a talk entitled Watching War Films With My Dad

Tudor expert Suzannah Lipscomb and historians Antony Beevor and Dan Snow will speak at the event, tickets for which go on sale today. Murray, who did a history degree at Oxford University, will give a talk titled Watching War Films With My Dad. Lieutenant Colonel Ingram Murray served with the Royal Engineers. He knew many who fought in the 1939-45 conflict, and passed on his expert knowledge to his son.

As a result, Murray says he ‘can’t help himself’ when he spots inaccuracies in blockbusters such as 1969’s The Battle of Britain. 

Of the film’s ‘German’ bombers, he says: ‘They’re not German planes, they’re Spanish planes made under licence after the war, which in an odd twist are powered by made-under-licence British Merlin engines.’

Murray, 45, told the Mail being such a pedant ‘can drive a man crazy’ – but history is ‘as important as physics’. ‘If you want to know where you’re going you’ve got to know where you’ve come from.’

Under fire: Al Murray says he can't help but correct mistakes in blockbusters such as the 1969 film The Battle of Britain, pictured, because of the knowledge he was passed by his father

He is a judge of the Penguin Chalke Valley History Prize for children’s historical fiction, and said of the festival: ‘The opportunity to get up close to people who are such experts is really, really brilliant.’

Journalist Max Hastings will speak on aspects of the First World War alongside guests including Miss Adie, Michael Gove and Jeremy Paxman

Squadron Leader Wellum, who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and whose memoir First Light topped the bestsellers list, will talk about his war service.The eclectic speakers also include Cold War expert Peter Hennessy, former England cricket captain David Gower, Philip Mould of BBC show Fake or Fortune?, actor John Sessions and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins.

As the centenary of the start of the First World War approaches, Miss Adie, journalist Max Hastings, Education Secretary Michael Gove and Jeremy Paxman will all speak on aspects of the conflict.

‘Living history’ includes a First World War trench experience and, marking 70 years since D-Day, a Second World War encampment.

There will be talks by D-Day veterans Geoff Pattinson, from elite paratrooper unit 9 Para, and David Render, of the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry, a tank regiment that gained more battle honours in the war than any other single unit. As well as Murray, history prize judges include Damian Lewis, Fast Show comedian Charlie Higson, and actress Haydn Gwynne. A two-day air show will feature the UK’s only flying B-17 Flying Fortress and a pair of Spitfires. The festival, in Ebbesbourne Wake near Salisbury, Wiltshire, runs from June 23 to 29.
