A fast-moving fire 
claimed four lives on Thursday in New Jersey's second-largest city, 
where the mayor said a mix-up over the street name delayed the emergency
 response.

Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said
 the fire also likely destroyed five houses and displaced at least 30 
people. He said it took firefighters 7 to 8 minutes to get to the scene 
instead of the usual 3 to 4 minutes because a dispatcher misunderstood a
 caller.

But the mayor said that officials do not believe the delay cost lives because the 
home was already engulfed when the first calls came in.

Tragic: At least four people were killed and five homes destroyed by the fire in Jersey City, New Jersey, Thursday

Mistake: Firefighters got to the fire later than they normally would after a misunderstanding with the 9-1-1 dispatcher about the address

Unfortunate: Mayor Steven Fulop says the delay probably didn't cost lives because the home was already engulfed when the first calls came in

'The calls indicated the house was already engulfed in flames,' Fulop said. 'It was already a multi-alarm fire out of the gate.'

The
 fire happened on Jersey City's Grant Avenue, but the mayor said an 
initial caller did not specify the street or avenue, and a dispatcher 
thought the person said 'Grand' instead of 'Grant.' Firefighters were 
routed to Grand Street instead of Grant Avenue.

'The
 911 dispatchers are obviously trained to deal with high-pressure 
situations,' Fulop said. 'But in the mix-up, the caller didn't 
distinguish ... You're dealing with people in the heat of the moment, 
and it's hard to get them to answer questions. That issue was part of 
it.'

The fire swept through part of a block of
 row houses. Authorities recovered two bodies by late morning, and 
brought out two other bodies later in the day.

Authorities
 hadn't released the identities of the dead by Thursday afternoon, but 
neighbors and people who said they knew the family said the victims were
 a pastor and his wife and children. Before the bodies were found, the 
mayor said a couple in their 80s and their two sons, who are in their 
50s, were unaccounted for.

Carolyn 
Oliver-Fair, of Jersey City, and Bernadine Byrd, of Newark, said pastor 
William Pickett often held services at his house and also preached in 
Newark and other areas.

'He was just a likable, lovable guy,' Oliver-Fair said. 'This is absolutely devastating. It's a tragic loss for the community.'

Authorities haven't said what they believe caused the fire.

As stunned neighbors looked on, firefighters used a ladder truck to peer into the second floor of the charred structure.

A
 man who lives across the street said he had returned home at about 1 
a.m. after celebrating his 40th birthday when he looked out his window 
to make sure he'd turned out all the lights in his car.

Homeless: Mayor Fulop says the fire destroyed at least five homes and displaced at least 30 people

'I
 saw the flames coming out of the first floor entrance,' Charles Davis 
said. 'At some point the wind was blowing the fire across the street and
 into the other houses, and they had to evacuate everybody.'

Video
 shot by Davis appeared to show a man running up to the house and trying
 to enter as the fire raged, only to be grabbed by police. Davis said he
 heard the man shouting, 'My grandmother is in there!'

Fulop
 said the fire broke out during a particularly difficult week for the 
Jersey City Fire Department. A funeral is scheduled for Friday for Fire 
Captain Gregory Barnas, a 29-year veteran of the department who also 
volunteered with the Wallington Fire Department. Barnas was killed last 
week after falling from the roof of a burning restaurant in Wallington.
