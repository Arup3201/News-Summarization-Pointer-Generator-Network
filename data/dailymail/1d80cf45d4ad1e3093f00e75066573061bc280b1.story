A gang that stole a powerful rally car belonging to former Boyzone band member Shane Lynch have been locked up after they were caught on camera driving the vehicle on a busy motorway.

The brazen cartel took the pop star's 200mph custom-built 
Subaru - worth £50,000 and belonging to his racing team
 Japspeed - while it was on public display at an event.

The thieves were part of a gang which operated for almost six months, stealing vehicles worth almost a quarter of a million pounds.

One of the gang then later tried to claim the £10,000 reward offered for the return of the one-off vehicle, which is part owned by Lynch, by selling information about its whereabouts.

Following a lengthy police surveillance operation, five gang members were sentenced to more than 15 years in prison for burglary, theft and handling stolen goods offences.

Judge Angela Morris said as she sentenced the gang: 'This was, by any view, a professional, well organised operation and on occasions ambitious to the point of being brazen.

'Offences were motivated by one thing and one thing only - greed.'

The gang first came to the attention of police last March following a string of high-end car and motorbike thefts in west and south London and their surrounding areas, Reading Crown Court was told.

Daniel O’Keefe, 31, and 28-year-old John Davis were among motor racing fans who attended a public event on June 11 at the Santa Pod Raceway, near Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, where the Subaru Impreza was stolen.

The car, which is not road legal, was custom-built for the motorsport of 'drifting' in which cars perform controlled slides around a track.

The vehicle, being driven by the pair, was filmed by motor racing fans driving on the M1, M25 and M4 motorway just hours after it was taken.

News of the high powered racing car’s disappearance quickly spread over internet forums and a major car hunt was launched with the racing team offering a £10,000 reward.

O’Keefe, Davies, and a third gang 
member, Cary Grant, aged 24 years, took the stolen vehicle to the home 
of mechanic and second-hand parts seller Peter Ballantyne in Windsor, 
Berkshire.

The gang members were captured on CCTV at Ballantyne’s home with the stolen racing car.

Japspeed
 driver Stephen Biagioni later received a call from the 40-year-old 
Ballantyne initially demanding £5,000 to provide information relating to
 the whereabouts of the car.

He claimed that the vehicle was already being stripped and broken up for parts.

Ballantyne
 arranged to meet the driver and - unbeknown to him the police - at an 
M4 petrol station and then led officers to the vehicle park near his 
sister’s home in Holyport, Berkshire.

The Impreza was undamaged but had been stripped of its bumper, rear spoiler and rear lights as well as identifying stickers.

Charles
 Evans, prosecuting, told the court that in the six months the police 
were trailing the gang they stole high performance vehicles and 
motorbikes to the value of £231,900.

In one raid seven bikes with a combined value of £90,000 were taken following a reconnaissance mission on a garage.

It was not known how long the gang had been operating before they came to the attention of officers.

Mr Evans said: 'They were a group of young men who often worked in pairs, twos or threes, and sometimes alone committing offences.

'They all had the technical know-how and the ability to do this and it was a case of if they became aware of a motorcycle or car, they would go and take it.

'There was not a chain of command insomuch as they were all in it together.'

Police used CCTV footage, mobile phone analysis and surveillance to trap the members of the gang.

On sentencing seven members of the gang Judge Morris, sitting at Reading Crown Court, said: 'This was a large scale operation involving all of these defendants at various times in burglary, theft, transport and or disposal of stolen high end motor vehicles and bikes.

'In some cases the vehicles were recovered. Most were not, or what was found was a burnt out write off.

'There is no doubt that this enterprise was well organised and bold.'

Craig Wells, 22, of West Drayton, admitted handling stolen goods, theft, and burglary, and was jailed for a total of 40 months.

Daniel O’Keefe, 31, formerly of Uxbridge, pleaded guilty to theft, handling stolen goods and burglary and was jailed for five years.

John Davis, 28, of Datchet, Berkshire, admitted theft and handling stolen goods and was sentenced to five years imprisonment.

Cary Grant, 24, of George Green, Buckinghamshire, pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods and was jailed for 18 months.

Peter Ballantyne, 40, of Windsor, admitted handling stolen goods and was jailed for 15 months.

Sumeet Kale, 28, of Northolt, pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods and received 12 months in prison but this was suspended for two years. He was also ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work, be subjected to a night time curfew and pay £250 pounds costs.

Daniel Pope, 22, of Uxbridge, admitted handling stolen goods and was sentenced to six months imprisonment suspended for 12 months. He was also ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work and be subjected to a curfew.
