This is the hilarious moment a distracted motorist was left red-faced when he crashed his car into a lamppost - while staring at two scantily-clad prostitutes.

The women were strutting across the road when they caught the man's attention.

In the video posted on YouTube, he stops his car and puts it in reverse, but is so enthralled by the pair that he doesn't notice the metal post behind him.

Second look: A motorist hits the brakes after noticing the scantily-clad women as they crossed the street

The video begins with the women, at opposite ends of a zebra crossing, walking toward each other on a street in the Russian city of Arkhangelsk, also known as Archangel.

Wearing their underwear and fishnet stockings, the women put on an enticing display that catches the attention of the passing motorist.

The man hits the brakes and begins to reverse to get a closer look.

Without paying any attention to his surroundings, the man backs right into a lamppost with a huge thud.

As the post rattles back and forth, he quickly becomes the laughing stock of the neighbourhood as the women and people off camera erupt in laughter and applause.
