English volunteers are fighting with Al-Qaeda in Syria and have warned America and Britain that the war will be taken to them next.

At least one hundred British soldiers are believed to have joined the civil war, alongside further volunteers from the U.S., France, Russia and Holland.

In interviews from the frontline, soldiers with English accents call on British people to overthrow the government.

This English volunteer soldier fighting in Syria with Al-Qaeda called on the British people to overthrow the government and pledged to make the country part of the 'Islamic world'

The head of the MI5 warned that hundreds of British people are fighting in the Syrian Civil War. This English soldier said British people would pay for the crimes of the government

One man, who speaks to Vice News with his face covered, declares jihad against Britain and America.

He said: 'I say to the United States that your time will come and we will bleed you to death and, Insha'Allah (God willing), shall raise a flag in the White House.'

He also said wants Britain to become a Muslim state.

Holding a rifle, the soldier said; 'I would like to say to the people of Britain, where is your democracy? Where is your freedom of speech? Where you say that you will help the people of Syria, but you have not helped the people of Syria. You have allied of Iran, of America.

We have to bring back the honour of Islam... To all over the Muslim world and Britain will be next. And Britain will be, Insha'Allah, in the Islamic world.'

A second British soldier, who also hides his face, says: 'You have the power to remove 
your government. Normal folk, will take the blame for the crimes that 
are committed worldwide, by Britain itself, so we have to fight.

'It's part of our obligation, to protect our honour and our women.'

The five minute video was taken by reporters given access to the Al-Qaeda factions of the Free Syria Army fighting against President Bashar al-Assad's forces.

Last week MI5 head Andrew Parker told a parliamentary committee the threat of ‘terror tourism’ to Syria was growing.

He warned: ‘We’ve seen low hundreds of people from this country go to Syria for periods and come back – some large numbers are still there – and get involved in fighting.

'It is a very important strand of the threat we face.’

Foreign fighters are flocking to the Syrian frontline, according to MI5.

Muslim leaders and governments across Europe have warned of the number of young Muslim men travelling to the war-torn country to fight jihad

The civil war has exposed Sectarian tensions in the country between Sunni and Shia people

Jihadist fighters are believed to make up about 10 per cent of the troops.

One French volunteer fighter said he had travelled to Syria for Jihad.

In order to organise the different nationalities, commanders have English, Russian, French and Dutch interpreters.

Muslim leaders and governments in Europe are calling on their citizens to return.

The Islamic Community of Kosovo said today that fighting in Syria 'has nothing to do with religious principles' and it only prolongs the life of Assad's government and the suffering of Syrian people.

Authorities say some 150 ethnic Albanians are believed to have joined foreign rebels.

German jihadists are also heading for Syria in increasing numbers and are able to integrate quickly into foreign militant groups where Arabic is not needed, the head of Germany's domestic intelligence said today.

Hans-Georg Maassen, head of the Bundesamt fuer Verfassungsschutz since 2012 (BfV), said they knew of 220 German citizens fighting in Syria, but the actual number could be much higher, and had risen sharply this year.

Such is the number of foreign jihadists, like this Frenchman, that commanders have had to hire translators

There are fears European fighters could bring the skills they have learned back to their native countries to wage war there

'For young people wanting to wage jihad, 
Syria is very interesting,' he said in an interview. 'It is easy to get 
to, you only need an identity card, a flight to Turkey then a domestic 
flight to the border.'

'Once you are there you can be quickly integrated into brigades, and you can fight alongside people with the same language.'

Syria's two-and-a-half-year-old conflict began as a wave of peaceful protests against four decades of rule by the family of President Bashar al-Assad, but it has transformed into a full scale civil war which has cost at least 100,000 lives.

The civil war has also exposed sectarian tensions.

Assad is from Syria's minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam, which has largely stood behind him. Syria's Sunni Muslim majority has led the uprising.

Fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front and the Islamic State for Iraq and the Levant, which is heavily comprised of foreign jihadists, have also joined the conflict.

Berlin fears young German Islamists could bring knowledge learned in Syria back home and plan attacks on German soil.
