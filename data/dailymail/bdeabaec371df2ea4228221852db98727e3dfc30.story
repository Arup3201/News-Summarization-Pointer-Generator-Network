The mother-of-two who danced under the name 'Geordie Jordan' had nine bags of cocaine in her handbag when police raided her home

A lap dancing club manageress who helped to supply customers with cocaine has been jailed for two years and six months.

House madam Cheryl 'Dolce' Byron, 45 supplied undercover police officers with bags of cocaine at £45 or £50 each during visits to the club Red Velvet, which has since closed.

According to the Northern Echo, two dancers also helped to 'sort' the officers, ‘Warren’ and ‘Paul’ with bags of the class A drug.

Shaun Dryden, prosecuting, said the four-month undercover operation culminated in the Consett premises being raided by police on December 14 last year, after two bags of cocaine were supplied to the officers, and a further nine were found in Byron’s handbag.

Police then recovered 326mg of amphetamines from her home in Lemington, Newcastle.

It resulted in the designated door supervisor and two dancers receiving cautions, but Byron was charged with supplying and possessing cocaine, and possession of the class B drug amphetamine.

But her admissions were made on the basis she did not supply anyone other than the two undercover officers, and that was only because she 'took a shine' to ‘Warren’.

Byron admitted she was a cocaine addict and took the drug with drink every night at work, but would not supply it to the dancers or to other customers.

She claimed she only supplied ‘Warren’ as she took a fancy to him, and it was not for profit.

But Recorder Amanda Rippon ruled that Byron was supplying cocaine beyond the two undercover officers.

Plainly, she was a supplier to people in general and not just to the undercover officers. She was also giving the drugs to the dancers.'

The 45-year-old worked as the house madam at Red Velvet in Consett, Co Durham. She supplied the two officers with cocaine with the help of two dancers

Recorder Rippon said there was 'a commercial enterprise', albeit with, 'a lack of sophistication.

'It appears to have been a relatively small-scale operation, but a commercial one, at that.'

According to the Northern Echo, Ms Byron's barrister, Gavin Goig, said that since the raid the mother-of-two has stopped taking cocaine and has curbed her previous heavy drinking.

Mr Doig said as a result she has been better able to help care for her mother, who suffers alzheimer’s disease.

He said Byron, the mother of two now grown-up children, has no 
previous convictions, having not come to police attention previously, 
despite her addiction.
