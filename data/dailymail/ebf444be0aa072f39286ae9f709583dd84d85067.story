Housebuilders will no longer be allowed to delay big developments after the government introduced stricter rules to prevent so-called 'land banking'.

Planning minister Nick Boles has scrapped a 2008 measure - introduced in the midst of the financial crisis - which allowed three-year permissions to be easily extended.

Some developers exploit the loophole and hoard plots for years as they wait for house prices to rise before starting to build homes.

Getting tough: Planning minister Nick Boles has scrapped a loophole which allows developers to extend planning permission. The announcement comes weeks after Labour leader Ed Miliband, right, threatened to seize land from firms who don't build on time

Mr Boles said: 'This measure to extend planning 
permission was always intended to be temporary and, while it made sense 
in the aftermath of Labour's financial crash when there was no money to 
build, as the economy improves the focus must be on accelerating the 
number of homes being built to meet demand,' he said.

'This
ending of the measure will increase the incentive for developers to 
start on site before permission expires. We are also now seeking to 
tackle the inappropriate use of planning conditions and speed up the 
process of gaining non-planning consents.'

The policy change comes in the wake of Labour leader Ed Milliband's announcement in Septemer that the party would seize developers' land if the failed to build.

He accuses developers of 'sitting on' lucrative land, pointing to research which found there were 400,000 homes that have not been built despite councils giving planning permission.

Mr Boles said those policies amounted to 'heavy handed...taxes and land grabs' which would slow the process and result in fewer homes being built.

'If developers fear new development taxes or state confiscation of land, they will be less willing to undertake complex land assembly projects; they will let their existing planning permissions lapse; or they will simply be more cautious in applying for planning permission in the first place,' he said.

Chelsea Barracks, located in one of the London's most exclusive districts,
was sold to Middle East property company Qatari Diar by the Ministry of
Defence for a record £959m in 2007 - but work on the £3bn development 
has still not started, leading it to be dubbed 'Britain's most valuable wasteland'.

The £3bn project first hit the buffers in 2009 when the firm, which bought the exclusive plot at the top of the housing bubble, withdrew its original plan for 552 flats after Prince Charles criticised it in a letter to the Qatari president.

Amid
rising costs and delays, another application was then submitted in 2011
for 600 units but, despite outline planning permission being granted, 
nothing was done.

It was stalled further earlier 
this year when Qatari Diar put the entire project 'under review', before
being ordered by Westminster Council to 'start or sell' the 13-acre 
site.

And the message 
appears to be getting through after the firm recently announced demolition work on all the site's remaining empty buildings is due to 
start this month, with the latest plans encompassing 448 flats, including 123 affordable.

A
spokesman said: 'Contrary to recent press reports, we 
are fully committed to the Chelsea Barracks development, are are 
currently negotiating rights to light with its neighbours.'

Qatari
Diar’s other London projects include the purchase of the US Embassy 
site in Grosvenor Square, the development of the Shell Centre building 
in Waterloo and the joint venture with Delancey for the Athletes’ 
Village in the Olympic park.

Mr Boles dismissed the 400,000 figure as a 'canard' deployed by local authority chiefs, insisting the latest data showed that of 257,200 unstarted private projects, 184,600 were 'progressing towards a start', 13,500 were 'being sold or information was not available' and only 59,100 were 'on hold or shelved'.

Simon Walker, director general of the IoD, questioned the effect of ending the rollover measure - which would require fresh applications should a permission lapse.

'Obtaining permission, particularly for large projects, is a very expensive and time-consuming process,' he told the Daily Telegraph.

'If builders do not have certainty that they will be able to use the land when they are ready to do so, it seems likely that it will deter some from applying in the first place.'

Shadow planning minister Roberta Blackman-Woods said: 'With even the Government's own statistics showing that there are hundreds of thousands of units with permission but not being built, they should support Labour's comprehensive measures to stop land banking of sites where the local community has given permission for homes to be built but developers are not building them.'
