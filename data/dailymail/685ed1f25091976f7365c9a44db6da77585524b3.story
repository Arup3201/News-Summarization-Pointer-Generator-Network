Manti Te'o is headed to San Diego after being chosen early in the second round of the NFL draft by the Chargers on Friday after being passed over by the first round picks.

Te'o, who led Notre Dame to the national championship game, was projected as a first-rounder last year but because of the hoax involving his fake girlfriend and his poor performance in a rout at the hands of Alabama dropped his stock.

The Fighting Irish All-American linebacker drew a loud roar from the fans when he was finally selected, but he was nowhere in sight having skipped the ceremony and stayed in Hawaii.

Completion: Manti T'eo was chosen by the San Diego Chargers on Friday during the second round of the NFL draft

When former Chargers defensive back 
Jim Hill was handed the card to make the announcement by Commissioner 
Roger Goodell, he was told, 'You're going to get a big cheer when you 
announce this pick.'

It was more a mix of surprise and 
recognition of the most talked-about player in the draft finally finding
a landing spot at No. 38 overall.

Unpicked: Te'o, a former Notre Dame linebacker, was not present at Radio City Music Hall for the draft, opting instead to stay at his home in Hawaii

The Chargers traded up with Arizona to
grab Te'o, whose tabloid-ready story of the woman who supposedly died 
during the season - only for the Heisman Trophy runner-up to acknowledge
in January that he had been a victim of a hoax - made for a national 
soap opera.

Te'o ran a 4.82-second 40-yard dash at the NFL combine, slow for a linebacker.

He did better at Notre Dame's pro 
day, but NFL teams already had plenty of football reasons to doubt his 
worthiness as a first-round pick.

The regular-season dominance by the 
6-foot-1, 240-pound All-American now seems so long ago. He led one of 
the top defenses in the country for an undefeated team.

His seven interceptions were more 
than any other linebacker in 2012, and he finished second in the Heisman
Trophy voting behind Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel.

He was the third linebacker chosen in this draft.

The teams believed to have taken the most interest in Te'o - the Chicago Bears (20th pick) and the Minnesota Vikings (23rd pick) - decided to go with and tackle Kyle Long and cornerback Shariff Floyd, respectively.

The Vikings had another shot at a first-rounder with the 25th pick, but went with Florida State University cornerback Xavier Rhodes instead.

Hyped up: He was expected to be selected during the first round but was passed over by multiple interested parties, perhaps because of a combination of his poor recent performance and his girlfriend hoax scandal

Even before the draft started, 
football fans could not resist taking digs at Te'o on social networking 
sites like Twitter and Facebook.

One
user tweeted a picture of an empty chair with the caption: 'Waiting 
with manti teo's gf waiting to see what team will draft him.'

Another posted: 'Manti Te'o has a better chance of getting a call from his fake girlfriend rather than an NFL team.'

Te'o's tragic story about his girlfriend, Lennay Kekua, tugged on America's heartstrings last September as Notre Dame began their push into the BCS championships.

Kekua supposedly died around September 12 from leukemia after recovering from a near fatal car crash - just six hours after his grandmother passed away.

Among those that paid tribute to Kekua was CBS, which showed a picture of her on This Morning with a direct quote she has supposedly said to Te'o: 'Babe, if anything happens to me, you promise that you'll stay there and you'll play and you'll honor me through the way you play.'

Fake: The Twitter account of Lennay Kekua was made using photos of Diane O'Meara, a high school classmate of Tuiasosopo who claimed she had never met nor spoken to Te'o

But it wasn't until a groundbreaking article on Deadspin.com that Lennay was exposed as an elaborate hoax.

The scheme was found to be orchestrated by Roanaiah Tuiasosopo, who admitted that he used phony Twitter and Facebook accounts to get Te'o's attention, win his affection and carry on an exclusive online relationship.

In those fake accounts was a picture of a woman, later identified as Diane O'Meara, a high school classmate of Tuiasosopo who claimed that she had never met or spoken to Te'o.

Te'o claimed that he was a victim, and was not in on the scandal.

In an interview with Katie Couric in late January, Te'o said that he briefly lied about his online girlfriend, after discovering she didn't exist.

But he maintained that he had no part in creating the hoax.

Deceived: Earlier this week Te'o emotionally 
denied he was involved in any sort of cover-up while instead admitting 
he believed Lennay Kekua, played by Tuiasosopo, was real

Self-indulging: Tuiasosopo said that he fell 
'deeply, romantically in love' with Te'o though he was playing him for a
fool while pretending to be a woman

Pressed by Couric to admit that he was in on the deception, Te'o said he believed that 'Lennay' had died of cancer.

'You stuck to the script. And you knew that something was amiss, Manti,' the talk show host said.

He
replied: 'Katie, put yourself in my situation. I, my whole world told 
me that she died on September 12. Everybody knew that. This girl, who I 
committed myself to, died on September 12.'

Couric also asked Te'o point blank: 'Are you gay?'

Cracking a smile, he responded: 'No. Far from it. Far from it.'

In an interview with Dr Phil McGraw, Tuiasosopo admitted that he was gay and fell 'deeply, romantically in love' with the Notre Dame linebacker even though he was deceiving him.

Tuiasosopo also confirmed that it was him impersonating 'Lennay,' despite the fact that voicemail recordings sound high-pitched and feminine.

Since the Couric interview, Te'o has mostly stayed out of the limelight, but appeared at the NFL scouting combine in February and was pictured during various workouts.
