Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri has hinted he would be keen on linking back up with Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli by suggesting he is among the world's best players.

Balotelli worked under Allegri during his brief stint at AC Milan before sealing a move back to the Premier League.

The Italian international has been linked with a move away from Anfield after failing to hit the ground running on his return to England and Allegri has claimed he would be keen on coaching the 24-year-old once again.

Allegri would be keen on signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Adnan Januzaj if they were made available 

Allegri, speaking to Italian newspaper Tuttosport, said: 'Mario had a good season with me, I think.

'Unfortunately he's built up a character outside the world of football and everyone talks about what he does off the pitch.

'I think he has some good technical and physical qualities, but the time came when it was up to him to prove his worth.

'All coaches like to train the best players. But Balotelli is a Liverpool player and I think first he has to think about playing well, sacrificing and giving his best - especially to show everyone who says he is an important player.'

Allegri has also stated he would be interested in signing Manchester United winger Adnan Januzaj and Dortmund's Henrikh Mkhitaryan if they were made available by their respective clubs.

He told La Gazzetta dello Sport: 'Mkhitaryan and Januzaj are two great players but I don't know if the clubs will sell them.'
