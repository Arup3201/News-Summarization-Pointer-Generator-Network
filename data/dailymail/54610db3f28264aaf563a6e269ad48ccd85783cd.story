Guilty: James McCormick (pictured leaving the Old Bailey today) made £50million from the sales of bogus bomb detectors to Itraq, Belgium and the United Nations

A businessman sold fake bomb detectors based on £13 novelty golf ball finders to security forces around the world, a court heard yesterday.

James McCormick, 56, imported large shipments of ‘Golfinders’ from the US and then sold them as bomb detectors for up to £27,000 each, it was alleged.

But the devices were ‘completely ineffectual as a piece of detection equipment’, jurors were told.

McCormick had simply attached stickers bearing the words International Association of Bomb Technicians to them to give them an air of authenticity.

He produced glossy brochures to trick potential investors into believing the devices could detect tiny amounts of explosive from three miles away, the Old Bailey heard.

He claimed they could detect explosives, drugs and ivory through walls, up to 30ft underground and 100ft underwater, jurors were told. They could also detect fluids and human beings.

But experts allegedly found that the bomb detectors were identical to cheap plastic handheld golf ball finders. The defendant sold a large shipment of fake bomb detectors to Iraq where they were used by police to search for explosives, it was said.

Nigel Gallier, a former colonel in the Army, wrote a report to his superiors which said it was obvious to him they did not work.

The detectors were also sold to Niger in Africa and to Georgia, the former Soviet state. Attempts were made to supply them to United Nations security forces in Lebanon, but the deal was never done. McCormick, who owns a farmhouse near Bristol and a Regency home on millionaires’ row in Bath, denies three counts of fraud.

Prosecutor Richard Whittam, QC, said McCormick made ‘a handsome but unwarranted profit’.

During one year alone, a company linked to McCormick was paid almost £850,000 for just under 6,000 cases to house the detector units.

Mr Whittam said the devices sold to security forces did not work ‘in accordance with the known laws of physics’. They were ‘completely ineffectual as a piece of detection equipment’ and were no better at identifying bombs than trying to detect them by random chance.

‘Rather than being designed and made as a result of an extensive research and development programme, the [device] was actually a golf ball finder that could be purchased in the USA for less than $20,’ he said.

‘The devices did not work and McCormick knew they did not work. But he had manufactured them so they could be sold despite the fact they did not work. When you learn of the claims made about what these devices were capable of you may think those claims incredible.’

The brochures produced by McCormick featured pictures of men in military outfits alongside claims the bomb detectors could ‘bypass all concealment methods’.

McCormick allegedly wrote that they could be used at airports, border control points, military bases, prisons and nuclear plants.

He offered three machines for sale through two firms – Broadcast and Telecom Ltd and ATSC – between 2007 and 2012. These were called ADE 650, ADE 651 and ADE 101.

When police raided McCormick’s properties in July 2010 they found invoices for hundreds of golf ball finders. A leaflet about the Golfinders discovered at his home said: ‘It’s a great novelty item that you should have fun with.’

Mr Whittam showed the jury pictures of a golf ball finder and one of the devices the defendant allegedly sold. He told jurors they were practically identical ‘in terms of shape, size, weight and construction’.

He said: ‘In reality, save for the stickers, they were indistinguishable. What that means is that they came from the same mould. The golf ball finder had been rebadged as an ADE 101.’

Although created from the same mould as the Golfinder, some of McCormick’s devices had minor modifications, the jury heard.

The trial continues.
