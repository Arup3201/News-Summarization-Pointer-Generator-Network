These impressive aerial photographs are the work of David Maisel, who specializes in taking large-scaled, otherworldly pictures of natural terrain that has been modified by human intervention such as mining for valuable natural resources.

Maisel has photographed such areas of environmental degradation for almost 30 years. Wherever he goes he hires a local pilot and a small plane to take him up anywhere from 500 to 11,000 feet in altitude where he can take his pictures.

His unaltered photographs of the landscapes are beautiful but at the same unnerving. What exactly has happened to produce these strange mutilations of natural beauty.

'The Lake Project' shows the ravaged playa of Owens Lake, a formerly one hundred-square mile natural glacial lake that was drained in order to supply water to the desert city of Los Angeles

A new book, Black Maps: American Landscape and the Apocalyptic Sublime, collects over 100 of Maisel’s photographs of open-pit mines, toxic waste sites, logging, freeways and other scenes that mark the toll humans have left on the earth.

'Maisel’s work over the past two decades has argued for an expanded definition of beauty, one that bypasses glamor to encompass the damaged, the transmuted, the decomposed,' write Leah Ollman of the Los Angeles Times.

He has been credited with transforming the practice of contemporary landscape photography with works such as 'Oblivion', which reveals the megalopolis of Los Angeles in tonally reversed black-and white images.

In 'The Mining Project' he depicts open-pit copper mines, tailings ponds, and cyanide-leaching fields throughout the American west.

Maisel was born in New York in 1961. His photographs have been exhibited internationally, and are included in many permanent collections including The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Back Maps: American Landscape and the Apocalyptic Sublime, the first in-depth survey of the major aerial projects by David Maisel is published by Steidl.

The touring exhibition of Maisel’s work, Black Maps, will be on view through May 11 at CU Art Museum, University of Colorado at Boulder, and then from June 1 through Sept. 1 at the Scottsdale Museum of Art, in Arizona.
