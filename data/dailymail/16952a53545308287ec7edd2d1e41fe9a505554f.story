Massive opposition to giving more money to Scotland – and overwhelming support for a new English Parliament is revealed today in a survey of voters in England and Wales.

The results suggest solid support in England for David Cameron’s claim that new home rule powers for Scotland must be matched by similar measures in the other three home nations.

The Prime Minister’s ‘English votes for English laws’ proposal struck a chord south of the border, with two in three English voters saying MPs representing Scottish seats at Westminster should be banned from voting on issues such as health and education. A mere one in five oppose the move.

But the Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday underlines the dangers facing Mr Cameron in trying to satisfy both Scots and non-Scots voters.

Although most people in England believe Mr Cameron and fellow party leaders Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg were panicked into the eleventh hour Scots giveaway by fears Alex Salmond was heading for a shock victory, they believe they cannot go back on their word.

The three party leaders are judged to have been wrong to make the commitment to devolve more powers to Scotland by a margin of two to one. A total of 70 per cent say it was a ‘panic’ decision against 16 per cent who say it was wise. And if they try to ram through the Scottish reforms after the next General Election – as they have promised – they could face a public backlash.

A majority of English voters say they want their own referendum before more of their cash is transferred from Westminster to Edinburgh. 

The survey also shows that former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown is considered to have saved the day for the UK – and the chief villain is fellow Scot, tennis player Andy Murray.

Some 21 per cent of English voters say Murray’s support for independence means they are less likely to cheer him at Wimbledon.

By contrast, the favourite moment for English voters was the Queen’s gentle nudge to Scots to ‘think carefully’ before voting to quit the UK.

More than seven in ten say the Barnett formula, whereby Scots receive around £1,600 of public money per head more than those in England, is unfair with only one in six regarding it as fair.

The English votes for English laws issue could have a dramatic effect on the future occupancy of 10 Downing Street.

Nearly half say it would make it impossible for a Scots MP to become prime minister, with one in three disagreeing.

Several Scots representing Scottish parliamentary constituencies have served as prime minister, including Gordon Brown and Alec Douglas-Home.

Tory MP John Redwood’s call for the creation of an English Parliament is supported by six in ten. But despite the heated controversy over the referendum, English voters are adamant there are far more important matters.

Immigration is far and away their biggest worry, followed by the economy, jobs, health and schools and fighting terrorism – with constitutional reform well down the list.

Nearly nine in ten people in England are relieved that Scots decided against cutting ties with Britain. Well over half believe Scotland will always be part of the UK, while only one in four say it will break away eventually.

Survation interviewed 1,081 people online on Friday.
