The late actor Richard Griffiths was known for halting plays to tell audience members to leave the theatre when he heard their mobile phones ringing in the stalls.

But opera singer Alfie Boe humiliated one woman with a ringing phone in a very different way at a concert in Cardiff - by interrupting his performance to pick up the device and speak to her mother.

The 40-year-old tenor revealed in an interview that he put the phone on loudspeaker through his microphone and told the woman he was in the middle of a show and standing next to her daughter.

The father-of-two told the Yorkshire Post: ‘Just as I was introducing the next song, I heard a loud ringing noise, and spotted a woman trying to switch off her phone.

‘So I walked down into the audience, made my way along her row, and introduced myself. I asked if I could have a look at her phone and pressed the redial button. It started buzzing at the other end.

‘Then someone picked up, and it was the woman’s mother. I told her that I was Alfie Boe, that I was in the middle of a show, and that her daughter was standing right next to me.’

Boe said the unidentified mother did not believe him when he told her his name, so he got everyone in the packed audience to shout it out, which ‘convinced her, and we had a very nice conversation’.

The singer told the newspaper that it was
 one of the most memorable moments of the performance - and he does not 
think the woman will ever again take a mobile phone to a concert.

Making their opinions known: Other actors who have criticised the owners of mobile phones for allowing them to ring during stage performances include Kevin Spacey (left) and Daniel Craig (right)

A spokesman for Boe told MailOnline it was not the first time the singer had answered an audience member's mobile phone at a concert - with the same thing happening at a show in Birmingham.

He added that Boe once took the phone of an audience member who was trying to take a photo of a concert - and posed for a 'selfie' with his band on stage, before returning the phone to them.

'I told her that I was Alfie Boe, that I was in the middle of a show, and that her daughter was standing right next to me'

Other actors who have criticised the owners of mobile phones for allowing them to ring during stage performances include Kevin Spacey, Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman.

Boe - who grew up in Fleetwood, Lancashire, as the youngest of nine children, and now lives in Gloucestershire - is married to American actress Sarah and they have two children - Grace, five, and Alfie, two.

The Liverpool FC fan’s real name is Alfred Giovanni Roncalli Boe and he was born to Irish and Norweigan parents. He was named after Pope John XXIII – whose last name was Roncalli.

The late Richard Griffiths (right) ordered a woman out of a performance of Heroes at Wyndham's Theatre in the West End in 2005 when her mobile phone rang three times.

Towards the end of the show, Griffiths asked her: ‘Is that it, or will it be ringing some more?’

He then asked to exit the Saturday matinee performance, saying: ‘Could the person whose mobile phone it is please leave? The 750 people here would be fully justified in suing you for ruining their afternoon.’

A year before he had told an audience member at The History Boys to leave the National Theatre after his phone went off six times.

In 2009, James Bond star Daniel Craig and X- Men's Hugh Jackman (right) lost their cool at a theatregoer for leaving his mobile phone on while they performed in A Steady Rain on Broadway in New York City.

They managed to stay in character as the phone rang, but as it continued their patience was pushed to the limit - and they told the member of the audience to answer the phone.

Jackman stomped about on stage as he asked: 'You wanna get that? Come on, just turn it off. Unless you've got a better story? You want to get up and tell your stories?'

The audience laughed and gave Jackman a roaring applause for taking a stand in the clip. Seconds later, another phone rang and Craig responded: 'Just get the phone.'
