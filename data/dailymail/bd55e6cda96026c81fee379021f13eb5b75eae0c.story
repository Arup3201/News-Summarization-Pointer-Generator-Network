Fishermen working off the coast of Taiwan have dredged up the jawbone of an ancient human ancestor that lived in the area around 200,000 years ago.

The short, thick mandible has unusually large teeth and a strong jaw compared to other human fossils found in East Asia, according to anthropologists.

The discovery suggests that it belonged to an previously unknown ancient human lineage. 

The fossilised lower jawbone (above) was dredged up in a fishing net 15 miles off the west coast of Taiwan

Experts say it means that there may have been several species of early human living in Asia until modern humans arrived 55,000 years ago. 

The fossilised jawbone is the first ancient hominin remains to be found in Taiwan. 

An ancient relative of humans has been dubbed 'Nutcracker Man' because of his powerful jaws and huge teeth.

Paranthropus boisei lived in Africa more than one million years ago and lived side-by-side with direct ancestors of humans. 

It has long been assumed that this species lived on a diet of nuts, seeds and hard fruit because of its powerful jaw muscles and the biggest and flattest molars of any known hominid in the anthropological record. 

The latest research has compared the teeth of these ancient human relatives with those of modern sea otters - known for their ability to crack through the hard shells of mussels and other shellfish.

Dr Adam van Casteren, a research fellow who led the study at the Max Planck Weizmann Center for Integrative Archaeology and Anthropology, found that P. boisei had tooth enamel that was remarkably similar in structure to those of sea otters.

Tests on otter teeth suggest that the teeth of these ancient humans could have withstood extremely high pressures and could mean they had powerful bite capable of destroying bone, nuts and other hard foods.

It was dredged up in a fishing net from the Penghu submarine channel, about 15 miles (25km) off the west coast of Taiwan.

During the Pliestocene between 2.5 million and 11,000 years ago, periods of low sea level would have meant the area was part of the mainland of Asia.

Anthropologists from the National Museum of Natural Science in Taiwan and the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo who studied the newly discovered fossils say it is unlike any of the other fossilised ancient humans that spread through out Asia.

Homo erectus, remains of which have been found in Java, Indonesia, and mainland China, tended to have much narrower jawbones and smaller teeth.

Researchers say that this suggests the robust-jawed 'Penghu man' had a different evolutionary origin from the 'classic' Homo erectus found in the area.

It could mean that it is either an entirely new species or a rare subgroup of Homo erectus. 

Dr. Yousuke Kaifu, an anthropologist at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo who was involved in the study, told MailOnline: 'It is a well-preserved mandible - a small fragment but contains a lot of information useful to evaluate its evolutionary position.

'What we can say is that it is clearly different from the known Homo erectus populations from northern China and Java, and likely represent a group that has been so far unrecognized so.'

He added that the species would have looked very different from modern humans.

He said: ''The new Taiwan mandible is markedly different from us in robusticity, not size, of the mandible. 

'Width of the bone at the lateral part of the mandible is 20.7 mm (0.8 inches) for Penghu, but on average 14 mm (0.55 inches) for fossil modern humans.' 

Dr Chun-Hsiang Chang, who led the research at the National Museum of Natural Science,  said the fossil appeared to have quite a primitive jaw but belonged to a now extinct species that most likely lived at a time when more anatomically modern humans were around.

He said the fossil either belonged to a new type of ancient hominin not previously identified or was the result of more robustly jawed immigrants from Africa moving into the region.

He added that the discovery also suggests that the traditional view of Homo erectus as the only ancient human species living on the eastern Asian continent until the arrival of modern man is incorrect and it may have in fact shared the area with many other human lineages. 

The Penghu mandible (centre) found off the coast of Taiwan is much larger than the lower jawbones of Homo erectus from Java (left) and China (right), despite its much younger age according to the researchers

The Penghu Channel (seen above), where the jawbone was found, was once been part of mainland Asia 

Dr Chang said most mandibles from Homo erectus from the early and middle Pleistocene in Asia had much thinner mandible bones and smaller molars.

He said: 'Several different models can be proposed to explain this situation. First, such morphology may be primitive retention from earlier Asian Homo.

'This hypothesis implies the presence of another longstanding Homo lineage in Asia that continued from the Early Pleistocene.

'Otherwise, there may have been a migration of robust-jawed Homo from Africa, possibly bringing along Acheulean stone tool technology around the terminal Early Pleistocene, who later evolved some unique morphology locally.

'Both hypotheses cast doubt on the traditional view that H. erectus was the sole hominin species on the Asian continent in the Early to early Middle Pleistocene.'

Scientists used CT scanning to create the virtual reconstruction above of the jawbone discovered in Pinghu

The teeth, seen here in CT scans, were much larger than those seen in other fossils but extensively worn

The fossil was found by local fishermen when pulling up their nets, who then sold it to a local antique shop, where collector Kun-Yu Tsai purchased it. 

Tsai donated his collection to the National Museum of Natural Science in Taiwan, where Dr Chang works.

Analysis of the fossil, published in the journal Nature Communications, show that it is an almost complete right side of the mandible, with many of the molar and premolar teeth still in place. 

However, the molars were found to be extensively worn and scientists hope this may help to provide clues about what this ancient human species may have eaten.

The wear also suggests that the jaw belonged to an older adult. 

The sockets where the incisor teeth would have sat could also be seen.

Although scientists struggled to accurately date the age of the fossilised jaw found off the coast of Taiwan, using sea level data and information about vegetation, they were able to estimate its age using isotopes found in the fossil. 

They say it is no older than 450,000 years and is probably younger than 190,000 years and could even be as young as 10,000 years old. 

With such a large age range, it is difficult to pin down exactly where in the evolutionary tree the fossil may fit and opens up the possibility that it may have come into contact with modern man, Homo sapiens, which moved into Asia around 55,000-40,000 years ago.

Scientists have yet to obtain DNA from the fossilised jawbone, but if they were able to, this could help them work out which species it is most closely related to.

During their study, the scientists found that the teeth are much larger than other Homo erectus fossils found in Asia at the time when the new species is thought to have been alive.

Instead they more resembled the teeth of fossils that were 400,000 to 800,000 years old.

In general the jaws and teeth of ancient human species grow smaller over time. Yet this jaw was found to be much larger than those of other species living at the time.

Homo erectus remains, like the one above, have been dated to between 1.6 million and 500,000 years ago

The scientists claim that it is similar to remains of another robust-jawed fossil, identified as an early Homo erectus , in Hexian, in the Anhui Province of China.The new finding suggests that these may belong to another unique branch of the human tree.

Some anthropologists, however, believe that it may be the remains of a sister group of the Neatherthals known as the Denisovan, which lived in Siberian Asia.

Professor Chris Stringer, research leader in human origins at the Natural History Museum in London who was not involved in the latest study, said: 'This enigmatic fossil is difficult to classify, but it highlights the growing and not unexpected evidence of human diversity in the Far East, with the apparent co-existence of different lineages in the region prior to, and perhaps even contemporary with, the arrival of modern humans some 55,000 years ago.'

He added: 'The jawbone also has some resemblances to even earlier H. erectus fossils from Africa, Java and Dmanisi (in Georgia), and to some Homo heidelbergensis fossils from Africa and Europe.

'But it does not sit easily in the latter samples, nor with other later Pleistocene archaic Chinese fossils such as Dali, Jinniushan and Xujiayao.

The new fossil had a larger and more powerful jaw than this forensic reconstruction of Homo erectus

'One plausible comparison is with the Siberian 'Denisovans', known from ancient DNA recovered from a fragmentary fossil finger bone and two very large molar teeth.

'If Penghu is indeed a long-awaited Denisovan jawbone, it looks more primitive than I would have expected.'

Other scientists have said that the fossil could be an unusually enlarged example from an existing species as skull sizes are known to vary considerably within species. 

Dr Simon Underdown, principal lecturer in anthropology at Oxford Brookes University and vice president of the Royal Anthropological Institute, warned against rushing to attribute this fossil to a new species.

He said: 'The discovery of this jaw in the fishing nets of a vessel off Taiwan while not a normal form of archaeological excavation is an exciting find. 

'While the authors of the paper suggest that it could represent a new species of Homo, because it’s teeth are unlike other Asian Homo erectus, we should be careful before adding this fossil to a new species and attaching it to the family tree. 

'The analysis of several Homo erectus skulls from Dmanisi in Georgia published in 2013 show that a huge amount of variation can exist in one species and reminds us that we should always take care when dealing with isolated individual fossils.'
