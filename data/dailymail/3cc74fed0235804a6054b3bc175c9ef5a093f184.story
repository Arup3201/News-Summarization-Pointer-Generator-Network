The mortified female office worker involved in a high-profile sex romp has moved back to her native England because ‘she wants to just cut all ties with everyone' in New Zealand, where the tryst occurred.

Both the 50-year-old regional manager and the 26-year-old female office worker are no longer employees at insurance firm in Christchurch, and the woman has returned to the UK.

‘She is a beautiful person but she's been such a silly girl who has made such a silly mistake that has had such massive repercussions for so many people,’ a source told The New Zealand Herald.

The man and woman involved in the office sex scandal in Christchurch have lost their jobs

The 50-year-old regional manager and the 26-year-old junior employee sex romp took place at the Marsh Ltd insurance firm (pictured) 

The unwanted publicity that came after video of the couple having sex in the office was posted online has horrified the young woman involved.

'She is not proud at all,' a person close to her also told the Herald. 'She wants to just cut all ties with everyone.' 

The steamy encounter between the two took place in the Marsh Ltd office at Papanui Road, while patrons from the Carlton Bar across the street cheered them on after unexpectedly getting front-row seats for the action.

Video footage and photographs taken by the revellers caused an online phenomenon that was watched by millions worldwide. 

Her Facebook page, which was shut down after the scandal hit, has now been reactivated. It says she is from Solihull, in the West Midlands.

After the footage became an online sensation, the woman's fiance phoned a local radio station to defend her, but he also claimed that they had split up some six months beforehand.

However NZME. News Service revealed that the pair had been 'on a break' at the time and that the engagement had not been officially called off at all.  

It is understood that this was not the first incident of its kind between the two former employees

It is believed confidentiality agreements prevent all parties from speaking, although it has been reported that this was not the first incident of its kind between the two former employees.  

The insurance boss involved in the scandal is married with a 15-year-old son and 19-year-old daughter. 

Unfortunately one of the people who saw the frolics on social media was the man's wife who reportedly found out about the devastating affair on Facebook. It is still unclear if his wife is standing by him.

An employment investigation was instigated following the scandal and all parties are now prohibited from speaking due to a confidentiality agreement

Last month the Daily Mail revealed that a friend of the man's brother, who is a glazer in the city, said that when the brother heard about the office romp he texted him about it, not knowing that he was the one actually involved.

'When he heard what happened he never thought that it was him. He actually texted him straightaway to find out who in the office it was,' the friend said.

'After he didn't reply he even asked, 'It's not you is it?' He was pretty shocked when he admitted that it was.'

When the Daily Mail Australia called at the regional manager's house in the affluent Christchurch suburb of Sumner to speak with him, the man refused to open his door or answer any questions.

The man was revealed as a husband and father of two. His wife found out about the incident after she saw it on Facebook
