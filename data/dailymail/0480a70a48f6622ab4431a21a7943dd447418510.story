These are the dramatic scenes as a Greek search and rescue helicopter winched 22 crew members from a Cypriot cargo vessel which ran aground earlier today. 

The Goodfaith cargo ship was sailing empty from Elefsina, near Athens, to Odessa in the Ukraine.

It is understood the cargo vessel lost power and was driven ashore by strong winds onto the island of Andros.

Greek authorities confirmed that all of the 22 crew aboard the vessel, pictured,  have been rescued after this morning's dramatic incident 

Crew issued a distress signal in the early hours of the morning after being unable to prevent the cargo vessel drift towards the rocky shoreline. 

The Goodfaith is understood to have traveled from Istanbul in Turkey before unloading in Elefsina. 

Three tugs have reached the 16,000 tonne vessel in a bid to prevent it from being damaged further.

The vessel, which has run aground in the Aegean Sea, was built in 1994. 

It is understood the captain reported that his vessel was taking on water.  

This latest maritime accident comes as the captain of the Costa Concordia, branded Captain Coward, was found guilty of manslaughter after his ship ran aground of the Italian island of Gigilo in 2012 claiming 32 lives.  

Francesco Schettino, dubbed 'Captain Coward' after he fled the ship before the 4,200 passengers were safely ashore, was handed the sentence this evening in Grosseto, Tuscany.

The 54-year-old was given ten years for manslaughter, five for causing a shipwreck, one for abandoning ship, and a further month for giving false information to port authorities.

His lawyers had launched a last-minute appeal yesterday attempting to blame the rest of the crew for the accident, but their attempts failed.

But despite the guilty verdict today, Schettino remains a free man and still has the right to two legal appeals which can take years to process, meaning he may never see the inside of a cell.
