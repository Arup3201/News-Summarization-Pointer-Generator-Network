The cynics insist we should never feel sorry for a coach with a long-term contract. It is a fine theory, but it did not survive the sight of Stuart Lancaster’s face on Saturday night. Pale, drawn, faintly desperate, he looked like a man who sees a wretched row of sleepless nights stretching before him.

He was correct and courteous, since that is his nature. He was impeccably loyal to his team, since that is his obligation. But after England’s fifth defeat in succession, he knew precisely what Twickenham Man was saying as the first pints went down. And he knew he would not emerge well from the beery inquest.

He clutched at the ‘positives’, aware that the word itself rang emptily after this latest reversal. He said he was ‘frustrated to have got so close’. He said that England had ‘enjoyed a lot of ball’, they had ‘generated good momentum’ in the second half, they had ‘played a lot of constructive rugby’. And that was about it.

England coach Stuart Lancaster defended his team after they suffered their fifth straight defeat 

Of more consequence were his more reflective observations. He said he had ‘learned about who can and who can’t deliver’ and repeatedly he stressed the need for England to be ‘smarter’, especially if they ever hope to beat the likes of New Zealand and South Africa, ‘the top two sides in the world’.

No coach enjoys facing the world after a string of defeats, and Lancaster is no exception. He knows that the pressure on him will certainly increase in the 11 months or so before the Rugby World Cup. And, deep down and unspoken, he must suspect that his squad has not improved; indeed, it may even have deteriorated. Expectations will be great, because they always are, but the notion that England might finish at the top of the heap seems thoroughly fanciful at the moment.

England assembled the kind of performance which pushes the sanest coaches towards neurosis. Careless to the point of sloppiness, with shoddy handling and sterile strategy, they frequently resembled those England sides of old, who rejected wit and creation in favour of the muscularity of the night-club bouncer.

A week ago against New Zealand, albeit in defeat, they did sufficient to provide the encouragement of which Lancaster spoke. On Saturday, the mood had evaporated. The Twickenham crowd traditionally waits for the home side to deserve its support. On Saturday, it withheld it until the cause was effectively lost.

Until then, Twickenham Man had been diverted by extraneous issues. Why do they think it necessary to flood the field with soldiers, sailors and airmen? I counted 61 service personnel in the pre-match ceremonies on Saturday, but there could have been more. This was, after all, an autumn international, not the Royal Tournament. And why do they make poor Laura Wright sing the national anthem wearing a flimsy, red evening gown in the chill November drizzle?

The distractions were understandable. The All Blacks game was conducted against a background of seething excitement. On Saturday, the mood was listless, slumberous, vapid. South Africa were no better than they had to be; similarly muscular in approach, but constructing counter-attacks with real speed and invention, and finishing them without mercy. And whenever the Boks felt themselves under threat, they could usually rely upon an English handing error - all too often from Billy Vunipola - to provide their relief.

The try they organised at the start of the second half was, by some distance, the best thing in the entire game. There was Pat Lambie’s elegant chip beyond English cover, there was Willie le Roux, striding on to clutch the ball from the air and making swiftly adequate ground, there was his subtle off-load to Cobus Reinach, and there was the controlled sprint to the line, culminating in a sprawl without a white shirt in sight. It was quite glorious, and the fact that it carried them to a 20-6 advantage seemed to have concluded the argument.

It was here that England found what slender satisfaction they could take from the match.

The rumbling, rolling drives made immoderate, unstoppable yardage, and with first David Wilson, then Ben Morgan taking their tries, an unlikely equality was achieved. But the flame was quickly extinguished, helped in no small measure by the crudely destructive impulse of England’s hooker Dylan Hartley.

South Africa came out on top 31-28 at Twickenham on Saturday to inflict another defeat on England 

He appeared to consider carefully the position of his feet when Duane Vermeulen lay on the floor. Hartley stamped down on the No 8’s knee, and then had the nerve to shake his head when he was packed off with a yellow card. Lancaster would mention lapses of discipline. Hartley should be in no doubt about the coach’s target.

England finished with earnest endeavour. They showed their expected character, but the Springboks showed class, lifting their game just as New Zealand had done. It was enough to come through, by a tiny margin yet with something to spare.

And Lancaster was left to speak of the ‘learning process’, to stress once more that England had just played the two best teams they could find, and to promise changes for Samoa next week.

He would not have thanked us for our sympathy, but he had it just the same.
