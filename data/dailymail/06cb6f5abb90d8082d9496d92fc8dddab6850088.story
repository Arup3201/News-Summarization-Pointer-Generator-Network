Top Gear, In the Night Garden and Doctor Who could all feature in a new £2billion theme park alongside characters from Star Trek and Mission: Impossible.

The BBC has signed a deal to allow some of its programmes to feature in the new multi-billion pound resort in Kent.

Plans are still being drafted for how the theme park will work, but BBC shows and characters could feature in specific lands, games and rides at the London Paramount Entertainment Resort.

BBC shows such as Doctor Who could feature alongside the Daleks at a new £2bn theme park being built in north Kent after the broadcaster signed a deal with developers for its rights to be used around the park 

London Resort Company Holdings (LRCH) - which is creating the £2billion park - has already signed a contract with Paramount Pictures, the oldest major Hollywood studio in existence, which could see elements from films including Mission: Impossible and The Godfather feature throughout the resort.

Organisers said the deal with the BBC and Paramount will mean they can combine 'Hollywood glamour with British culture.'

It will mean Captain Kirk, captain of the USS Starship Enterprise in Star Trek, could be seen at the park in rides themed around the science fiction classic. The latest deal with the BBC may mean that some of the corporation's biggest characters, such as Doctor Who and the Daleks may also feature. 

A brochure for the proposed theme park includes pictures of what it may look like which show some elements of Paramount classics - including a 'Mission Impossible control centre' and Star Trek emblems alongside a ride.

The resort on the Swanscombe Peninsula in north Kent is scheduled to open in Easter 2020.

Stephen Davies, director of live events at BBC Worldwide said: 'We're always looking for opportunities to extend fans' enjoyment of their favourite shows and the idea behind this resort is a really exciting way of celebrating the very special place the BBC has in British culture.'

BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the broadcaster, has signed a deal with LRCH which will allow the company to use the rights for its programmes. In return profits from using these rights will be paid to BBC Worldwide and invested back into the broadcaster.

It will work in a similar way to the CBeebies land at Alton Towers, which has an agreement with the BBC to use the intellectual rights of the property. 

David Testa, director of LRCH, said: 'The BBC has played an instrumental role in shaping the British entertainment industry for nearly a century, creating some of the most iconic and cherished characters on TV and radio. 

The resort which will feature a theme park, water park, cinema and large theatre is expected to open in 2020 

Plans for the resort appear to show a Star Trek themed land, with the emblem visible on one of the rides 

Paramount had already designed a deal with developers and hints of its productions have been seen in the plans, with a Mission: Impossible training centre detailed in sketches and Star Trek emblems on rides 

'It seems only right therefore that it's programmes will be present at the new London Paramount Entertainment Resort, which will combine the glamour of Hollywood with the best of British culture.'

Both the BBC and LRCH would not be drawn on which specific films or shows would feature, or if they would appear in lands or as specific rides. 

The theme park will also include a water park and 2,000 seat theatre alongside themed games and rides throughout. It hopes to attract 15 million visitors a year. 

The BBC has signed a development agreement with LRCH but said there were no firm plans in place as to which programmes would be featured and whether they would appear in lands or rides. 

Developers plan to build a huge £2billion Hollywood-inspired resort in Kent.

Paramount Pictures had already given permission for its name to be used for the proposed development on the Swanscombe Peninsula.

Developers hope the project – which would be built on the site of a former cement works near Dartford - will open in 2020.

It would be located near Ebbsfleet International station, which is on the Eurostar route between London and Paris.

The 872-acre site - nearly twice the size of the Olympic Park in Stratford - will feature Europe’s largest indoor water park, rollercoasters, cinemas, theatres, hotels and live music venues.

The site's developer, London Resort Company Holdings, estimates that the project would create up to 27,000 jobs in the area.

Announcing the plans in 2012, project leader Tony Sefton said: ‘Our vision is to create a world class entertainment destination, the first of its kind in the UK.'

Paramount Pictures films include the Madagascar franchise (pictured). A similar entertainment resort is due to open Spain in 2012, which will feature a Titanic Experience and rides based on Mission Impossible, Star Trek and War of the Worlds.

The latest agreement with the BBC means programmes such as Dr Who and Top Gear could feature in lands, rides and games across the new park.
