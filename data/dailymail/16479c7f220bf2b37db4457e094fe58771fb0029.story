There are many ways for Arsene Wenger to defend his record at Arsenal: two 4-1 wins in a week are a fair start. Specious claims about the Champions League, however, are not. ‘Since I arrived we have played over 180 Champions League games,’ Wenger said. ‘You will see that before then they didn’t play too many.’

Yes, and there is a reason for this. Wenger arrived at Arsenal in 1996. Until season 1997-98 only the champions were allowed to enter UEFA’s main competition — unless the league winners had already qualified as European Cup winners. In 1999-2000 that was expanded to three Premier League qualifiers, and later four. So how many times would Wenger have made it into Europe under the restrictions placed on every previous Arsenal manager? Four.

He would have qualified with Arsenal as champions in 1997-98, 2001-02 and 2003-04. In addition, the year Manchester United won the competition, 1998-99, Arsenal would have made it in the following season as runners-up.

Meanwhile, had previous Arsenal managers played by Wenger’s rules over the same time period, they would have qualified on eight occasions. In 1988-89 and 1990-91 as champions, but also in 1979-80, 1980-81, 1986-87, 1989-90, 1991-92 and 1993-94 by finishing in the top four.

Wenger also overlooks that the first time Arsenal won the title under George Graham they were not allowed to take their place in the European Cup due to the ban on English clubs.

And, no, what went before does not compare to Wenger’s 16 straight Champions League qualifications, but they were different times, and the financial stranglehold of the elite clubs was not in place. 

Wenger has done wonderful things at Arsenal but he has been aided by an era that has placed Europe’s most prestigious club tournament beyond the reach of all but a few. If his predecessors had been given that advantage they would surely have played more European football; had Wenger worked with their limitations he would boast nowhere near 180 appearances.
