He has been patiently waiting in the shadows for the right time to strike. Now Agent 47 has finally made his move, but does he still deliver that killer blow?

Thankfully, within 15 minutes of soaking up the sights from the Glacier 2 engine, it’s clear 47 has lost none of his edge.

Licence to kill: Missions are varied and are teeming with interesting and life-like characters.

Hitman: Blood Money had a slightly cartoon-feel to it, with samey looking characters populating worlds that lacked soul and character.

But realism is paramount in Absolution, with levels inhabited with NPCs that have personality. You’ll hear people talking about arguments with their wives, playing guitars in their hotel rooms, confiding in friends – this is a living, breathing world like no other.

This serves as a wonderful contrast to the death and destruction – and, disturbingly, reinforces a sense that you are taking a ‘life’ rather than eliminating a lifeless ‘bot’.

Environments are sumptuous, too, the highly-saturated colour palette giving the entire game a Hollywood-style sheen.

Whether it's walking along the sun-kissed
balcony of a beach-side villa, or exploring the dank, underground sewers below
a nightclub, Absolution brings each world to life with remarkable aplomb.

The narrative is so strong (involving a kidnap), that there’s a reason for the variation, too – and loses that fragmented feel of its predecessor. Indeed, this is perhaps the closest thing to playing Liam Neeson’s Taken that you’re going to get.

Gameplay has also had a significant overhaul. You are still awarded points for creative kills but there is now much more choice.

Want to snipe a target? You can. Fancy getting up close and stabbing him in the back? That's possible, too - although it's very difficult.

You are encouraged to steal other people’s clothes, but NPCs can often see through them. Agent 47 can use his ‘instinct’ to camouflage himself slightly, but characters are very hard to trick.

Initially, early levels may consist primarily of trial and error, as you get used to the rather ruthless AI.

They also react realistically to your actions. In Blood Money, you were quickly shot in the head for going into an ‘out of bounds’ kitchen.

Here, you’ll be warned off and given time to walk away. Only if you stand there staring blankly at someone will they get angry and try to arrest you.

This is made all the more convincing by the voice acting. Although not uncommon to hear characters mutter the same phrases, as much care and attention has been put into the NPCs’ dialogue as it has the game’s key players.

Waiting in the shadows: Agent 47 can use disguises but sometimes stealth is the best approach

Agent 47 can also use his instinct to see through walls and identify targets. It generally works well, and is put to brilliant use in the point shooting mechanic.

Here, when multiple takedowns are needed, you can mark and execute targets – similar to in Splinter Cell: Conviction.

Indeed, there’s no sense of a mission being a failure if you’re forced to use your weapons – unlike its predecessor which often resulted in a bloodbath if a hit didn’t go to plan.

Often killing the character who has sussed you out results in enemy suspicion and alertness to decrease or vanish.

Longevity is helped through each missions’ carefully-intertwined sub-challenges. These range from collecting new weapons, to acquiring all of the disguises.

They work well, although you never feel punished if you finish a level without all the loot available.The campaign mode will take most players around 10 hours, but thankfully Contracts mode offers plenty more thrills.

Here, you play through the levels and assign three targets. You then compete online to get the highest score by assassinating them in whichever way you wish.

Take a risk or play it safe? Sometimes the most obvious path is the most dangerous. Thankfully, levels offer lots of different ways to slip past potential threats unnoticed.

But given the strength of Absolution’s campaign, it’s hard for this not to feel slightly tacked on.

Still, this is the deadliest Hitman yet that's destined to be a hit.
