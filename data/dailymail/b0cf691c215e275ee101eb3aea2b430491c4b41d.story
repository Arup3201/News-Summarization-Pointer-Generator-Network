Miranda Kerr has been dropped as a Victoria's Secret Angel because of her 'difficult reputation', it has been claimed.

The Australian supermodel, who is married to British actor Orlando Bloom with whom she shares two-year-old son Flynn, has been let go as one of the main faces of the lingerie brand after her $1 million, three year-contract 'was not renewed'.

Have her wings been clipped? Miranda Kerr in the 2012 Victoria's Secret catwalk show in New York in November

A source told America's Us Weekly that
 the 29-year-old beauty 'has a difficult reputation' and suggested it 
was the main reason she will no longer walk the company's star-studded 
annual catwalk show wearing a prestigious pair of angel's wings, an 
honour reserved for just a handful of the brand's top faces.

Another source suggested the brunette
 model is 'not a big seller for VS', compared to its other Angels like 
Alessandra Ambrosio, 31, Candice Swanepoel, 24, and Adriana Lima, 31.

Miranda will reportedly still walk in the company's runway show later this year and will also appear in its catalogue.

Frosty? Sources claim the model isn't very friendly with her fellow Victoria's Secret Angels

The source said: 'They can still use 
her for catalogue, where she will get a day rate, but she doesn't have 
to be an Angel to do that.'

A separate insider tells People she is known in the industry as a diva, adding: 'She can be difficult at shoots and appearances. She's not very timely. She's standoffish with the rest of the girls.'

But one source added: 'If Miranda and
 Victoria's Secret part ways it's not because of her behaviour. It's 
purely contractual. She'll be coming back for the show but it's unclear 
if she'll be in future campaigns. But she is definitely one of the most 
popular models and in high demand.'

Executives from Victoria's Secret did
 not deny that Miranda's contract has not been renewed, but chief 
marketing officer Ed Razek insisted he has already invited her to walk 
in the 2013 runway show in New York in November.

He said: 'Miranda Kerr is one of the
 best models in the history of the business - and easily one of the most
 popular. She is also a consummate professional.'

'Any rumours to the contrary are 
simply untrue. While her international commitments have kept her away 
from us more than we’d like over the past few years, she will always be 
an Angel to me … In fact, I’ve already invited her to walk the runway in
 this year’s fashion show and, happily, she’s agreed.'

Other Victoria's Secret Angels include Lily Aldridge, 27, Karlie Kloss, 20, Doutzen Kroes, 28, and Erin Heatherton 24.
