Loss: Thomas Pizzey from Banbury, Oxfordshire, pictured before he was disabled, died after he was flung from a car that was hit by a train

A wheelchair-bound pensioner was killed when a train slammed into a car he was in that had cut out on a railway level crossing, a coroner has been told.

The vehicle, which contained 85-year-old Thomas Pizzey, who was sat in his wheelchair inside the vehicle, stalled and broke down as it was being driven over the crossing.

Mr Pizzey, of Banbury, Oxfordshire, died instantly when he was flung from the car and his wheelchair as the train passed through the level crossing and smashed into the car.

Seconds earlier driver Malcolm Kimberley had stalled as he drove across the tracks before the barriers were activated.

He frantically tried to restart the car as the barrier closed while the train bearing down on them.

Motorists from another car scrambled to help the stricken driver and his disabled passenger in the 'nightmare' scenario, the inquest in Oxford heard.

However, the car would not start and the train had no time to stop, leading to the fatal crash.

Mr Pizzey, aged 85 years, was in the back of the Kangoo car being driven by his civil partner Mr Kimberley.

Oxford deputy coroner Alison Thompson heard how the 78-year-old drove onto the line in Sandy Lane, Yarnton, Oxfordshire, on January 3 this year, when the engine cut out.

After trying a number of times to restart the car nearby motorists Stephen McDermott and partner Louise Poulter rushed to the 'panicking' driver who was still trying to start the car as it was hit.

Mr Kimberley survived the impact but suffered serious injuries as a result of the collision.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Nicola Wood told the inquest the driver of the train, which was travelling from Manchester to Southampton, braked and sounded the horn on approach.

'As the driver accelerated to come across the crossing the car stalled and the engine stopped,' she said.

'He tried to start the car a number of times but with no success.'

She told the inquest Mr Kimberley had
previously reported to a garage that the car had once failed to start 
but it passed an MoT test in March last year.

Thames
Valley Police vehicle examiner Philip Balderstone said the extent of 
damage to the car meant tests were inconclusive but the 'most probable' 
reason was a failure of its engine management system.

Britain's 500 most dangerous level crossings are to be shut after nine were killed and hundreds narrowly avoided death in the past year alone.

There are 7,000 in the UK and for years there has been growing pressure to act following a spate of deaths.

Almost £110million has been set aside for the purge, which will also pay for new bridges, underpasses, gates and signs to make the thousands of others across the UK safer.

This has been spearheaded by the parents of Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and her friend Charlotte Thompson, 13, who died when they were hit by a train in 2005 as they crossed the tracks at Elsenham station footpath crossing in Essex.

Network Rail section supervisor Jon Waddy said the crossing’s barriers were operated automatically by track circuits which detected approaching trains.

These give a minimum of 27 seconds from the barriers coming down until a train passes through. The pensioner’s car was hit after 45 seconds

'If somebody had picked up the phone immediately and said ‘stop’ it may well have been still too late', Mr Waddy added.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mrs Thompson said Mr Pizzey’s wheelchair was not totally secured into the back of the car.

He was wearing a seatbelt and the wheelchair winch mechanism was attached but two other tether points were not. He died from impact injuries sustained when he struck the ground.

She said of the 'nightmare scenario': 'The horror of being there and not being able to start the car does not bear thinking about.

'Had the wheelchair been tethered properly it is more likely he would have remained in the vehicle and he would have suffered less severe injuries.'

She also concluded there 'was a problem with the engine management system' but added that 'we can’t take it further than that'.

Two nieces who attended the inquest said the family felt 'very sorry' for the train driver who they did not hold responsible in any way for the collision.

“This was a very tragic way for my uncle to die and the family are sad that his long life ended in this way”, they said.

*Just 10 days ago a woman aged in her 40s had to be cut free from her Volkswagen car after being struck by a train at the same crossing. She suffered non-life threatening injuries and was detained under the Mental Health Act.
