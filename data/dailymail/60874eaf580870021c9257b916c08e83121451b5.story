An Italian judge has ordered an international police hunt for a belly dancer at the centre of sex allegations surrounding former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.

Karima El Mahroug, 19, was due to testify at Berlusconi's trial relating to the 'bunga bunga' parties he held at his villa near Milan, but she failed to show up.

Miss El Mahroug, also known as Ruby the Heartstealer, gave the court no warning and even her lawyer admitted he had 'no idea' where she was.

The teenager is said to have been paid for sex by Berlusconi when she and dozens of other women attended his now infamous gatherings.

The age of consent in Italy is 14 but paying a woman for sex under the age of 18 is a crime. The Moroccan-born exotic dancer was just 17 at the time of the alleged offences.

The judge at the trial in Milan ordered police to search for her 'in Italy and abroad' as she is thought to have flown to the United States last week and is not due back until after Christmas.

Her sudden disappearance has prompted speculation as to who paid for her flights and accommodation.

Furious prosecutor Ilda Boccassini said it was another delaying tactic by Berlusconi's legal team to ensure the trial drags into the upcoming election campaign.

She stormed: 'This is yet another attempt by the defence to draw out the length of this trial.

'They have already dragged their heels with other witnesses. Today's absence is unauthorised and there is no documentation.

'I really don't believe there is any prospect of her appearing at this trial. This is a strategy to take the case into the election campaign.'

If the trial does stretch into next year ahead of February's expected general election, Berlusconi - who announced at the weekend he would be running for office - is expected to use it as a tool in his battle for power, and say that once again it shows prosecutors are politically motivated and simply out to get him.

Paola Boccardi, Miss El Mahroug's lawyer, said: 'Her mobile is switched off, as is that of her partner. She sent me a text message a few days ago which said she was abroad and that was it. I don't know when she will be back.'

Berlusconi's legal team, led by slick Nicolo Ghedini, hit back at the prosecution's argument, saying it was 'intolerable and defamatory', and asked the judge to look closely at Mrs Boccassini's words.

However, other witnesses that the defence had called - such as George Clooney and Cristiano Ronaldo - have also failed to show up.

The Hollywood actor's spokesman denied claims from Berlusconi's legal team that he had even been summoned to appear.

Berlusconi went on trial last year over the sex allegations, which focus on a series of parties he is said to have thrown at his luxury villa at Arcore near Milan.

Showgirls and wannabe starlets allegedly performed erotic dances for him and were paid with cars, cash and jewellery.

Both he and Miss El Mahroug deny any wrongdoing, although the teenager is said to have boasted to friends that Berlusconi gave her several thousand euros for attending the parties and that he was besotted with her.

The former cruise ship crooner-turned-politician has fought numerous legal battles in his 20-year career and two months ago he was convicted of fraud.

However, he has insisted all the trials he has faced are politically motivated and he is innocent of all accusations.

At the weekend, when he confirmed he would be standing for prime minister in the next election, the Italian stock market plunged more than three per cent and borrowing costs soared, amid fears of a period of economic instability.

The election had been due to take place in April but was brought forward two months after technocrat prime minister Mario Monti announced he would step down at the end of the month after the 2013 budget. His position was also confounded after Berlusconi's party withdrew support for him.

Political experts say Berlusconi, 76, is unlikely to win the election since his People of Freedom party is trailing in third place behind the centre-left Democrats, who are led by Pier Luigi Bersani.

Professor Christopher Duggan, an Italian historian at the University of Reading, said: 'Ever since being found guilty of tax fraud, Berlusconi has been looking to relaunch himself and his party, in order, as he says, to save Italy economically from the austerity policies of Monti and politically from a return of the left to power.

'He is also seeking to salvage his personal reputation, which stands to be further compromised by impending verdicts in criminal court cases. The move looks set to seriously destabilise the present government and induce a period of considerable political insecurity in Italy.

'Such insecurity in the third largest economy in the eurozone could have major consequences for Europe as a whole, especially if Berlusconi seeks to mobilise Italian public opinion not just against the policies of Monti but more generally against Europe and the Euro.'

If convicted of having sex with an underage prostitute, Berlusconi faces a three-year jail sentence. He is also on trial for abuse of office after prosecutors said he lied to cover up for Miss El Mahroug when she was arrested for theft - wrongly telling police she was related to then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and should be freed.
