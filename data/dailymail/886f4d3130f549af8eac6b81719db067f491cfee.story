It proved an emotional day for Menelik Watson, but the Oakland Raiders leave London feeling sorry for themselves after sinking to a tenth straight defeat.

Thrust in to the action in the second half following a knee injury to starting tackle Khalif Barnes, Watson and the Raiders were routed 38-14 by the Miami Dolphins.

'It's not the result we wanted. We had a great week of practice. We were really prepared,' Watson said.

'The game of football is like that. I think there's things which we did and that I'm proud of and a lot of guys on the team are proud of that we kept fighting right to the end.'

The 6ft 5in Mancunian led the Raiders out onto the field and with his mother and daughter watching him play for the first time, he admitted the moment was a special one.

'I think the best part was when the English anthem came on. That was such an emotional moment because usually it's just the American anthem. I always blow a kiss when I'm in America, because I always wish my dad and mum could see me play. They were there, so I just let them know that I found them in the crowd and let them know that I can see them and know that they're there.

'I try not to be caught in the moment a lot. It was a little emotional before the game. But as soon as we started and I was coming in the extra tackle package, I didn't notice the crowd, I was out there just trying to complete the assignments.'

With Watson being used sparingly this season, it was a case of next man up as he entered the fray.

'Unfortunately, Khalif went down and I was in. And I got a little second on the sidelines and it felt like, well, this is kind of historic to be at home and a guy goes down and I have to step up.'

And Watson faced a familiar face in the shape of Cameron Wake - and the Dolphins' pass rusher kept him on his toes.

'He's a great player. I met Cam when we came out here for the media day. We got to chat it up a little bit. And I told him out on the field that there was a second where I kind of laughed at him. I said, yeah, I know what you're doing. And I said, well, guess what, adjustment. I just made some adjustments. But he's a great player, as you all know.

'I didn't give up a sack. Just a couple technical things I was a little sloppy at, which he capitalised on. He was bending the corner really well and I wasn't getting out of my stance. I wasn't using my length at first. Every once in a while, I got to use my length. And a couple times he got a hold of my shoulder. Just a couple little things that I was doing, technical wise, that was allowing him to have a little edge.'
