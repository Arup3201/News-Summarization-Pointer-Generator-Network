Professional Cricketers' Association chief executive Angus Porter does not want the row over Moeen Ali's Edgbaston abuse to boil over, and claimed that the England spinner should take it 'as a positive'.

Ali was booed by Indian fans during the hosts' T20 win in Birmingham on Sunday.

His father Munir believed it was because of Moeen's Pakistani background, and police treated it as a 'non-crime hate related incident' after an official complaint from a spectator.

'His dad offered his view sincerely and I hope it doesn't stoke the fire because he was just standing up for his boy,' Porter said.

'There is an element of taking it as a compliment. You are more likely to boo someone when you think they are someone to be feared.

'Take it as as a positive, you'd rather be booed than ignored.'

Porter added there was no place for any racial abuse but would be surprised if it had come from the Indian fans.

'It shouldn't happen but I have always found the Indians to be respectful and it is a little bit surprising in that respect,' he said.

India's tour has been littered with ill-feeling, with Ravindra Jadeja booed by England fans after his clash with James Anderson in the Test series earlier in the summer.

Spin: Angus Porter said that the abuse 'shouldn't happen' but said it was better than being 'ignored'

Porter wants supporters to refrain from all types of abuse and appreciate the game instead.

'Supporters pay their money and they are entitled to express an opinion, but I don't think it's exclusively about Moeen,' he said.

'You see other players get booed. Jimmy Anderson gets booed when he goes to Yorkshire and it's disappointing when players are performing as entertainers and doing their best. It would be great if spectators saw the positives.'

The police would need more evidence to pursue the issue and Moeen, who took one for 31 in the game which England won by three runs, does not want to make a complaint.

Moeen's father Munir believes the booing had racial undertones and insisted the Birmingham-born spinner should not have to contend with any abuse.

'We are very disappointed with what happened. It should have been a special day,' he told ESPNcricinfo.

'Moeen was playing for his country in the city of his birth. It is the city I was born in and the city my mother was born in. 

Family: Ali's father believed the booing had racial undertones and said his son should not have to endure it

'The whole family was looking forward to it and we thought he would receive a warm welcome.

'Instead he was abused from the start. He was abused because he is a Muslim and because of his Pakistan heritage. That is disgraceful.

'We have experienced so much kindness and goodwill from all communities - Indian, British and Pakistani - in recent months, so it is disappointing that some supporters let their team down with this behaviour. There is still a problem with racism between Asian communities in the UK.'
