Lazar Markovic's early strike and lively first-half performance was enough for Liverpool to escape the Stadium of Light with all three points. Here, Craig Hope runs through how the players performed.

SUNDERLAND (4-1-4-1) 

Costel Pantilimon -  5.5

Kicking suspect yet again and does little to instil confidence in his defence.

Santiago Vergini - 5

A disaster at times, giving ball away and failing to get forward. A torrid afternoon.

Wes Brown - 5.5

Could not handle movement and trickery of Liverpool frontline and was run ragged. Very lucky not to concede early penalty.

John O’Shea - 6

Tried his best to lead backline but was himself at sixes and sevens. 

Costel Pantilimon manages to divert Liverpool striker Fabio Borini away from goal at the Stadium of Light

Patrick van Aanholt - 5.5

Got forward when possible but lacked quality and was also caught dithering once or twice at other end.

Liam Bridcutt - 5

Saw enough of ball and broke things up, but was simply outclassed and was needlessly sent off despite soft nature of second booking.

Adam Johnson - 6

Not enough flair or invention when his side needed it in first half but was much improved after break and cracked bar with one vicious drive.

Jordi Gomez - 5

Anonymous throughout and slowed things up far too much when he did come into possession.

Seb Larsson - 6

Way below standards he has set this season but was doing the job of two men after Bridcutt dismissal.

Emanuele Giaccherini - 5.5

The odd flash of creativity but off the pace against fitter and stronger opponents.

Connor Wickham - 5.5

Not afforded a kick in the first half but was hardly helped by poor supply-line.

SUBSTITUTES

Will Buckley (on 77) - 5.5

Danny Graham (on 77) - 6

Liam Bridcutt receives his marching orders after picking up a second yellow card against Liverpool

LIVERPOOL (3-4-2-1)

Simon Mignolet - 6

A spectator in the first-half but did what he had to with minimum fuss after break.

Martin Skrtel - 6.5

Strong when he had to be, although that wasn’t often.

Emre Can - 7

Strolled through and used his passing range to prise open Sunderland defence from deep before moving into midfield and again impressing second-half.

Mamadou Sakho - 6.5

Like the rest of his defensive comrades he enjoyed an easy 90 minutes. 

Lazar Markovic - 7.5

Should have won a penalty before his clever opener and was close to spectacular second. Beginning to shine after slow start.

Lucas Leiva - 7

Barely had to break sweat but kept the ball well and anchored midfield with authority.

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard celebrates in front of the away fans after his side took a first-half lead

Jordan Henderson - 7.5

Never wasted a ball and teased passes around the park. Took the armband second half. A class act.

Alberto Moreno - 6.5

Saw the weakness in Vergini and supported attack at every opportunity.

Steven Gerrard - 7

Was in the mood for goals and went close three times in first half before departing at interval. 

Philippe Coutinho - 8

Outstanding, so easy on the eye and terrorised hosts with his cunning runs. Man of the match.

Jordan Henderson lets fire but his long range effort flew high and wide over the Sunderland goal

Fabio Borini - 7

He was more graft than craft and did not allow home defence a moment’s rest.

SUBSTITUTES

Dejan Lovren (on 46) - 6.5

Rash booking was first contribution but steadied and was comfortable.

Mario Balotelli (on 66) - 6

Frustrated team-mates at times with poor decision-making but picked up where Borini left off with work-rate. 

Liverpool striker Borini failed to score from this promising position before being substituted in the second-half

Italian striker Mario Balotelli, passing Wes Brown, came off the bench in the second-half against Sunderland
