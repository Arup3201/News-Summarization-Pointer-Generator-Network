Rio Ferdinand was given a warm reception on his return to Old Trafford but endured a miserable afternoon against his former club.

The 35-year-old spent 12 years with Manchester United, who made him the world's most expensive defender when they signed him for £30million from Leeds in 2002.

Despite recently criticising the club over the way they handled his summer departure, Ferdinand was given a warm reception by United's players and fans as Sir Bobby Charlton presented him with a pre-match gift.

Unfortunately for Ferdinand, that was as enjoyable as his afternoon got. Angel di Maria scored his first goal for the club before Ander Hererra repeated his team-mate's feat. Wayne Rooney then added a third before half-time.

While the former Leeds defender could not shoulder all of the blame for QPR's porous defence, he undeniably played his part in a collectively poor defensive display.

A second half goal from Juan Mata then compounded the miserable afternoon, and this time Ferdinand's age was on show as his poor positioning played Spaniard on side. 

It was, ultimately, a miserable afternoon for Rio Ferdinand and his QPR team-mates

Rio Ferdinand won six Premier League titles during his time at Manchester United

The former Leeds man also won two League Cups, the Champions League and the FIFA World Club Cup

During his time under Sir Alex Ferguson, Ferdinand enjoyed considerable success.

An honours list that boasts six Premier League titles, two League Cups, a Champions League and the FIFA World Club Cup meant it was only the FA Cup which evaded him.

Ferdinand would have lifted the trophy had he not missed United's 2004 success in the competition through suspension after he failed to turn up for a drugs test. 

Nevertheless, the QPR defender admitted his time in Manchester had far exceeded his expectations.

Upon leaving the club in May, he said: 'I joined Manchester United in the hope of winning trophies, and never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined how successful we would be during my time here. 

'There have been so many highlights, playing alongside some great players who have become good friends, winning my first Premier League title and also that fantastic night in Moscow are memories that I will cherish forever.'
