Rosie Corrigan has become the youngest elected female mayor to take up office, aged 21

A 21-year old student has become Britain's youngest female mayor after taking her first foray into politics to launch a campaign to get tuna paninis added to her school lunch menu.

Die hard Labourite Rosie Corrigan has been a town councillor in her hometown of Selby since she was 18.

The left-wing campaigner even shares a love of politics with her councillor boyfriend, Will Lockwood - but unlike his girlfriend he is a staunch Conservative.

Miss Corrigan said: 'It feels wonderful to be elected even if the story of how I got into politics is a bit embarrassing.

'I'm really pleased that Selby and the Council have realised it's a good idea to have a younger person as a mayor.'

While other students are preparing for their summer holidays, Miss Corrigan has been hard at work attending 
meetings and considering council finances.

After serving on her school council - where she led the call for tuna paninis to be added to lunchtime menus -  she co-founded Selby Youth council and was a member of the UK Youth Parliament.

After she'd been elected as a councillor she served as Deputy Mayor for a year.

Then on May 19th, Miss Corrigan was chosen by other councillors to become Mayor.

She's just finished her penultimate year of a politics degree at Hull University and is looking forward to taking on the responsibility of Mayor.

She said her family and friends are incredibly supportive, particularly her boyfriend Mr Lockwood, who serves as a councillor in nearby Tadcaster.

But she admitted the pair have embarked on some heated political debates.

Miss Corrigan said: 'My friends and family are very supportive, even though my boyfriend's a Conservative.

'We have lots of heated political discussions.'

She added: 'I just really enjoyed representing young people and getting involved in my local community.

'I was so lucky to be elected as elected as a councillor 2011 - you had to be 18 in January to register and my birthday is in December so I made it in by just a month.

'It's been great to get involved as younger member of the council.

'It really encourages young people and children to help out in their communities and get their views across.

'I want politicians to listen to young people because too often children and young people get overlooked.

Last year Liberal Democrat councillor Joe
 Harris junior was elected as civic leader of Cirencester, 
Gloucestershire at the age of 20 - the youngest male to be elected.

Mr Harris became the youngest councillor in the UK when he was first elected in 2011 at the age of 18.
