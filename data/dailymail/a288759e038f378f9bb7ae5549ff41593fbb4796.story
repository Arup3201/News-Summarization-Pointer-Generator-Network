A couple of weeks before the end of the season, Southampton’s new executive director Les Reed felt compelled to clear up a few outstanding issues.

It was a spot of housekeeping, a reminder that everything was neat and tidy and in good working order as Southampton prepared to finish the season in eighth place.

According to Reed, in a briefing with the media that was widely broadcast on April 27, there was nothing to see and nobody would be leaving Southampton. Move along, please.

Is that the way to White Hart Lane? Mauricio Pochettino was quick to depart St Mary's after leading Southampton to eighth in the Premier League

Reed had been monitoring the news and was so irritated by the consistent reports linking manager Mauricio Pochettino and many of his players with moves elsewhere he felt a declaration was in order.

Pochettino, he claimed, spoke with Reed for an hour a day, sometimes more, at Southampton’s training complex to discuss transfer targets and the club’s pre-season programme. All was well, he said.

Contract negotiations with the Argentinian manager would progress smoothly, they just had to get the final two games of the season out of the way first and then it would all play out.

Reed’s second point was about the players. There had been no bids and reports that they were negotiating ‘stellar transfer fees’ and salaries were well wide of the mark. Well, well, wide of the mark.

He hammered home this point several times.

The problem with a well-intentioned and earnest speech like this is when the protagonists have very differing opinions on how it will all play out at the end of the season.

Pochettino was not about to walk out with two games left, against Swansea and Manchester United, of the season. That, in his mind, would come later.

The problem with Reed’s endless cups of coffee in the manager’s office after training is that you can’t always see the bigger picture.

Take Pochettino’s surprise visit to the Parc des Princes for the Champions League quarter-final first leg between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, as an example.

Pochettino would be hard pushed to pass off a trip to Paris to watch two of Europe's superpowers as a scouting mission.

He was there in case it all went wonky for PSG coach Laurent Blanc, putting himself in European football’s shop window at a time when he knew he was likely to leave Southampton.

As soon as the season was over - and Tottenham had sacked Tim Sherwood - chairman Daniel Levy began negotiating his release from St Mary’s.

Pochettino’s departure is no reason to panic, but the uncertainty surrounding the players is of far greater concern to Southampton’s supporters.

Of course there were no bids for Southampton’s players at the time of Reed’s housekeeping address because Liverpool, for example, were distracted by the title race.

In any event, no matter how much interest Brendan Rodgers had in Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and the outstanding Dejan Lovren, the transfer window was not even open. More on them in a moment.

In between Pochettino’s departure to White Hart Lane and the completion of Lambert’s £4m move to Liverpool, two of Southampton’s outstanding academy coaches have been fired by Reed.

This is all part of a fairly petty power battle between Reed, the Under 21 development coach with Jason Dodd and Paul Williams.

To give you an idea of the esteem the pair are held in by the young academy graduates, Luke Shaw pointedly went off message while he was away with England to tweet that it was a bad decision.

There has been friction in this area of the club for some time, mainly because the Under 18s served up by Dodd and Williams would bypass Martin Hunter’s Under 21 side to be involved with the senior side.

That is a reflection of the quality that Shaw, James Ward-Prowse, Calum Chambers, Harry Reed and Sam Gallagher possess.

It is a great pity because Southampton’s academy system and the commitment to youth is the envy of not only Premier League football, but Europe too.

The sale of Lambert makes sense, particularly when a club is willing to absorb his wages, in excess of £50,000 a week, at the age of 32.

Homegrown talent? Luke Shaw is another one from Southampton academy's famed production line who looks set to leave

For Reed, the wider issue is whether he can really convince his captain Lallana, plus Shaw and Lovren to stay at St Mary’s.

There was a time under former executive chairman Nicola Cortese when this club had ambitions to finish fourth and qualify for the Champions League. That feels like a long way off now.

Lallana is convinced he played his last game for the club on the final day of the season and Shaw is agitating for a move to Manchester United.

If they all leave, then Reed’s words will have a hollow ring to them.
