It was sold as a property with 'incredible potential'.... which more or less means it's either ugly or needs a lot of fixing up.

But that didn't stop a buyer forking out more than a million dollars for 24 Heller street in Brunswick, a modest and run down home in Melbourne's north.  

Rather worn and in need of a paint job on the outside, the Brunswick home also needs a bit of love and tender care... and some new carpet, on the inside.

The Victorian period home has been in the same family since 1923 and was described by the real estate agents as having 'exciting prospects'

The property is rather run down inside, with ripped and poor carpets, peeling paint on the walls, cracks and stains

The 'substantial Victorian period home' which has been in the same family since 1923 was sold at auction on Saturday for a whopping $1,101,000.

Woodards real estate agents described the property as having 'exciting prospects' while selling it on it's great location before it went under the hammer.

'Surrounded by the enticing dimensions of a significant allotment, proximity to public transport, beautiful local parks and Brunswick's bustling Sydney road and Grantham street scene.'

'This property represents an incredible opportunity to comprehensively renovate and re-model the present day proportions or to pursue new home site scope.'

The home has three to four 'generous' bedrooms, high ceilings, one bathroom and also one car parking space with a sizeable garage.

The Brunswick home was on a 491 square metre property and sold for more than a million
