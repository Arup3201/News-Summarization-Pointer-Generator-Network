Court Battle: Helen Nicholas, 45, is fighting for the right to stay in the forces home she shared with her husband after he left her

The ex-wife of an RAF squadron leader has launched a legal battle against the Ministry of Defence - claiming its bid to remove her from her forces home after her husband left her breaches her human rights.

Helen Nicholas, 45, lived at the three-bedroom Government-owned property in Bushey Heath, Watford, for eight years with her husband, Squadron Leader Andrew Nicholas.

But after the couple separated and Mr Nicholas moved out of their home in 2007, Mrs Nicholas was told she no longer had a right to live in the property.

The MoD then obtained a court possession 
order in 2010, but Mrs Nicholas refused to leave and has 
been effectively squatting in the property since.

Mrs Nicholas is now contesting the order in the High Court in the first case of its kind. 

Her lawyers argue that removing Mrs Nicholas from the property would amount to discrimination and 
breach her right to respect for her home and private life.

The court heard the property was purchased by the government in 1996 to house an overspill of RAF personnel and their families.

But Mrs Nicholas's counsel, Toby Vanhegan, insisted the
MoD does not need the house for another services family to live in and just wants to 'sell it without a sitting 
tenant'. 

He added that she potentially faces life
on the street if evicted, because Hertfordshire County Council do not 
class her as a local resident, and will not give her housing priority 
due to her semi-itinerant status as a forces wife.

'Mrs Nicholas has lived at the property 
for over eight years, has gone through difficult divorce proceedings, 
has no other accommodation and risks being street homeless if evicted 
from the property. She is unlikely to obtain assistance as a homeless 
person,' the barrister said.

Jonathan Davey, for the MoD, told the judge that Mrs Nicholas only ever had a right to live in the house under a 'licence' granted to her husband alone, and that was lawfully revoked after he moved out.

'In April 2007, Mr Nicholas moved out of the property following a breakdown in his marital relationship with his wife. The licence is stated to be entered into between the Defence Estates, on behalf of the Secretary of State for Defence, and Squadron Leader Nicholas.

'In the events that have occurred, including Mr Nicholas permanently leaving the property and the MoD serving notice, the licence has been terminated,' the barrister insisted.

He said that the MoD’s stance is backed by legislation and denied that its aim is to get Mrs Nicholas out merely to ease the sale of the house or get a better price for it.

'Our aim is to recover possession of the property in order to fulfil a key aspect of the MoD’s statutory functions, namely providing accommodation to servicemen and servicewomen,' he added.

Recognising the wide importance of the case, Mr Justice Burton reserved his decision until an unspecified later date.

Mrs Nicholas, who was has been married to her husband for 15 years, said outside court: 'The council don’t see me as a local resident because I come from a services family, so they won’t give me any priority for housing even if I become homeless.'
