A Minnesota police officer who has been accused of the unprovoked and vicious beating of a suspect that was captured on video has been placed on leave and is the subject of an 
internal investigation.

In the footage, St.Paul police officer Jesse Zilge is seen to kick suspect Eric Hightower once in the 
chest and then with
the assistance of another officer slam his head onto the 
hood of a squad car.

Police however said that HIghtower was a dangerous suspect who was wanted by authorities for allegedly threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend which is the reason why the police officer pulled him over.

Talking from jail, 
Hightower told the Pioneer Press he and his friends were on their way to
a park when an officer jumped out of a squad car and ordered everyone 
onto the ground. The officer singled out Hightower and began spraying 
him with a chemical.

Hightower said he never resists arrest, but 
said: 'Why would I get down on the ground when you still haven't told me
what was I under arrest for? I don't feel like I was obligated to get 
down on the ground just because you said so.'

While on the ground,
Hightower said he continued to ask the officer what he did wrong, but 
the officer wouldn't say. Hightower said the officer pointed his Taser 
at him, but didn't use it. He said the officer became agitated.

'He
sprayed me in my face again. I was laying on my side, I was hocking up 
the stuff, it was choking me and he ran towards me, kicked me in the 
chest, kicked me in the chin,' Hightower said.

Hightower said the spray caused his eyes to swell and his face was numb. He said he couldn't hear anything out of his right ear.

He
told the newspaper that he used a water fountain to flush out his eyes 
at the jail, and he also saw nurses and received ice packs for swelling 
on his chest.

Eric Hightower said he didn't know why he was being arrested, nor why was he kicked when Officer Zilge pulled him over

A 
brief report filed by Zilge lists hands, fists and feet among the 
weapons used by police in the arrest, but does not describe the events 
shown in the video that was recorded by a citizen and posted to YouTube 
on Wednesday.

Hightower, 30, had been accused of threatening to 
kill his ex-girlfriend. He was charged Thursday with stalking, making 
terroristic threats and criminal damage to property.

He told the 
St. Paul Pioneer Press he didn't know why he was being arrested, and the
kick was delivered as he lay on the ground, coughing and choking on the pepper spray that Zilge had used on him.

'It was like he was 
kicking a football or something,' said Hightower to the newspaper.

'He 
kicked me so hard, he knocked the wind completely out of me.'

When assistance arrived for Officer Zilge the two officers approached the squad car and slammed him down on top to prevent him from moving

Police
spokesman Howie Padilla said police learned of the video after someone 
sent a link to the department and the Chief Thomas Smith of St Paul. Police ordered an internal investigation.

'The
video of a St. Paul police officer striking a suspect raises serious 
questions about the conduct of the officer,' said Mayor Chris Coleman said in
a statement.

'I have high expectations for the department and its 
employees. We will fully investigate and take appropriate action.'

While
several officers appear in the video, Zilge was the only one placed on 
paid administrative leave. A phone listing for a Jesse Zilge was 
disconnected.

St. Paul Police Federation President Dave Titus told the 
Pioneer Press that Zilge is a good officer.

'This cop was dealing 
with a very dangerous individual in a very dangerous situation,' Titus 
said.

Five squad cars and nine police officers can be seen at the scene of the arrest of Mr. Hightower

'Back-up was not immediately available. And maybe our officials 
shouldn't make comments about their concern until the investigation has 
run its course.'

Zilge's personnel file was not immediately available.

According
to the complaint filed on Thursday, Hightower's ex-girlfriend called 
authorities on Tuesday and said Hightower had been harassing and 
threatening her for two days.

The woman told police she feared 
Hightower, and that he had assaulted and choked her before.

According to the 
complaint, he admitted to police that he called his ex-girlfriend and 
threatened she'd get her 'head blown off.'

But Hightower said he only 
meant to scare her, according to the complaint.

Hightower has a 
criminal record that includes 2007 convictions for petty theft and 
violating a protection order.

In June of this year he pleaded guilty to a
gross misdemeanor of obstruction of justice and interfering with a 
peace officer.

He is also awaiting sentencing on a count of third-degree
assault for an August 2011 incident in which he punched a man in the 
face, knocking out his two front teeth.Â
