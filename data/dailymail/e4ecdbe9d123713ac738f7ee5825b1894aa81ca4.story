Most men can only dream of slipping under Holly Willoughby's sheets...but now they can.

The TV presenter has unveiled a range of bedding for BHS, so FEMAIL caught up with her for some serious pillow talk.

'I was asked if I would be interested in doing a homeware range and immediately said yes because something that I love doing in my own life is making my home look nice,' she explained.

In bed with Holly: Miss Willoughby has unveiled a range of vintage inspired bedding for BHS

'People always say "what do you do in your home life?" and I don't really have anything, all I do is work and be a mum but if there was one hobby I have, it's decorating my home.'

Holly, who juggles motherhood, TV presenting, fashion designing for Very and modelling duties, has been very hands on with her BHS range.

The 32-year-old spent two years putting together mood boards from her inspirations and she couldn't be happier with the final result.

'From goodness knows what age, I've always bought home magazines, taken out cuttings and kept scrap books. So it's quite natural to do this and I wanted to make bedrooms that I'd want to sleep in,' she explained.

Hobby: The 32-year-old, who has been working on her designs for two years, says that she's always had a passion for decorating

While there's plenty of vintage-inspired lace, feminine prints and eye-catching pearl fringes, Holly has ensured that her range appeals to men too.

'I have a husband that has a pillow phobia, he hates that I put cushions and pillows everywhere. So I have added nautical and masculine touches to my range. I like things to be really beautiful but really practical to use.'

So what's Holly's own boudoir like?

'My bed is my favourite place to be in the whole world. I have candles everywhere and laundry sprays so when I get into bed it smells nice,' she said.

Low maintenance: Holly, whose face greets the nation every day on This Morning, explains that she swears by make-up wipes

Much to the disappointment of her male fans, Holly - who regularly tops Sexiest Women In The World polls - takes a 'comfort first' approach when it comes to bedroom attire.

'What do I sleep in? Well, I've got a onesie, it's definitely onesie weather,' she said.

But you won't see her pulling on a 'twosie' - a the two person onesie - with her husband Dan anytime soon. 'I'm not sure about twosies, I like my onesie for myself, there's no room for anyone else in it,' she laughed.

Holly also shared her pre-bedtime beauty regime with us - and you'll be surprised to know that, despite her glossy and polished looks, she's a low-maintenance girl.

'Make-up wipes are my saviour. I used to be useless at taking my make-up off at night, I'd wake up with a print of my face on the pillow.

'You can get away with that when you're younger but I'm at the point where I think "Holly, it's time to grow up".

'Liz Earle do some great wipes, they're really nice and organic. I tend to use lots of Liz Earle stuff and love her day moisturiser,' she said.

So how does she keep her skin looking so flawless despite early morning stints on This Morning? (Earlier in the day she had mediated 
between Peaches Geldof and Katie Hopkins, who argued over parenting in a debate that carried on after the cameras stopped 
rolling, revealed Holly).

'I am one of life's big sleepers, I could sleep anywhere, any time.

'I go to bed early unless I'm out. I am a sneak into bed at 9pm gal. I'd go earlier, but it's wrong to miss out.

'Most mornings I wake up and go "it's OK, you'll be getting into bed again tonight".

'Left to my own devices I would just sleep and sleep, that's why having kids was such a surprise. I'm like "what do you mean they wake up in the night? Do I really have to get up now?!",' she laughed.

Aside from juggling young children, early mornings and new projects (she has also recently released a children's book with her sister), Holly couldn't be happier right now.

'I'm in a really good place at the moment with work and life. I've had afternoons off which is unheard of and I can spend time with my daughter when she isn't at nursery, which is really nice,' she said.

It seems like life is a sweet dream for TV's favourite face.
