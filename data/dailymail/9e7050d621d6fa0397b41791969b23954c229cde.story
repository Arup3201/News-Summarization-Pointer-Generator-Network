A woman who drowned her newborn baby in a toilet did it because she was afraid of losing her job if she had a child, a court has heard.

Nitrogen plant worker Marzena Kowalski, 30, thought she had committed the perfect crime when in August last year she gave birth on her parents' toilet and then immediately drowned the baby.

But after telling her distraught parents she had suffered a miscarriage, an autopsy revealed the baby died from drowning.

She then admitted to the killing when quizzed by police.Â

Appearing in court this week, Kowalski - from the small village of Sniadowko in south-eastern Poland - told the judge that she had kept the pregnancy secret because she had been worried that her boss would sack her if he found out.

And she admitted killing the newborn out of fear that he would fire her if she became a mother.

She told the court: 'I was afraid that my employer would not extend my contract and that I would not be able to find work if I had a small child.'

She then told the court that she was again three months pregnant and that she bitterly regretted what she had done.

Her stunned co-worker Michal Kowalczyk, 27, said: 'We often saw her walking around, chatting and laughing as normal.

'She didn't look pregnant and didn't let on that she was.

'When we found out what she had done we were completely shocked. It just seems so out of character.'
