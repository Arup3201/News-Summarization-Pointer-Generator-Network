An Ohio man is lucky to be alive after blowing his arm off with high-powered, homemade fireworks he bought from a neighbor just a few days before the Fourth of July holiday.

Kevin Skubic, 34, says that on July 1, he paid 65-year-old Wayne JonesÂ  $200 for 50 homemade 'quarter sticks.' The homemade explosives are nearly three times as powerful as M-80s, a popular explosive that can be found in most fireworks stores.

Skubic says he's bought similar fireworks from Jones in the past and nothing went wrong. But when he purchased the quarter sticks this year, his life was changed forever.

When Skubic was leaving Jones' house, he noticed that the bag holding the explosives was on fire as he approached his pickup truck parked in front of the man's house.

'When I threw the bag, it just blew up right in my face,' he told NewsNet5, the ABC affiliate in his hometown of Akron. 'I looked down and my arm was hanging off. I didn't want to go into shock. I just started praying right away.'

Skubic suffered severe injuries from the blast, including flash burns, hearing damage and a detached retina -- in addition to his severed arm and finger. The father of two girls says he was convinced he was going to die.

Ouch: In addition to losing his arm, surgeons had to do skin grafts to replace skin lost during the blast with skin from Skubic's legs

'I'm glad to be here with my family, not have my mom and dad go through burying one of their kid,' he says.

After the explosion, Skubic was taken to Akron General Medical Center, where he underwent skin grafts where surgeons used skin from his legs to replace skin on his right arm that was lost in the blast.

'I
don't even know how I made it through. I look at the video of my truck 
and the impact it took, and then my body, they're still pulling 
cardboard out of me everyday,' he says.

Powerful: The explosives that injured Skubic are three times more powerful than M-80s -- as his truck found out the hard way

Jones has been charged with manufacturing explosives, unlawful possession of dangerous ordinance, illegal assembly of chemicals/explosives and possession of criminal tools. However, he claims he didn't assemble the explosives and had simply been storing them for Skubic.

'I think they're blaming me for what happened to him,' Jones told reporters after he was released from jail. 'He's a grown man -- I didn't have anything to do with it.'

Skubic, however, says the fireworks were assembled by Jones, and that he's been buying them from him for years.

'I
never made a firework and I don't know how,' he says. 'I just went over there to 
buy them like every year... In my head, I think they hoped I would have 
died.'

Jones is scheduled to appear in court on July 19. Skubic, meanwhile, has some advice for fireworks enthusiasts.

'Don't play with fireworks no matter what age you are. It's better to go watch and see them from a distance,' he says.
