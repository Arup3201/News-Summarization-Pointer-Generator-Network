Southampton players are convinced manager Mauricio Pochettino will leave the club this summer.

The Argentinian has made a huge impact at St Mary's since his arrival midway through last season.

Pochettino is a leading contender to replace the sacked Tim Sherwood at Tottenham this summer.

Spurs are expected to make an official approach to Southampton to speak to Pochettino this week.

And there is a feeling among members of the Saints squad that Pochettino has his heart set on a move to White Hart Lane ahead of next season.

There is a greater fear among players that the core of the Saints' squad will disband this summer.

Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw are both set to leave St Mary's this summer - while Calum Chambers and Morgan Schneiderlin are targets for Arsenal.

Sportsmail understands Shaw has told his Southampton team-mates that he is joining Manchester United this summer, while Lallana has indicated to pals that last season was likely to be his final one in a Saints shirt.

Having a look: Chairman Daniel Levy has a raft of potential candidates to take over ahead of next season
