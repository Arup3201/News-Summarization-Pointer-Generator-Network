Leicester City's on-loan midfielder Nick Powell would seem to have a place in his heart for another Midlands club as a youngster if a picture he posted on Instagram is any guide.

Displaying an impressive mop of blond hair, he showed off admirable ball skills even back then as he had a kick about in his garden. 

Powell posted the message with the tagline: 'Guess I liked Villa back in the day. Worldie haircut!' 

Nick Powell displayed a fondness for Aston Villa in his younger years

The 20-year-old joined the Foxes on a season-long loan from Manchester United but is yet to make an appearance for Nigel Pearson's men.

United signed the midfielder from Crewe Alexandra in 2012 and big things are expected of him.

Powell spent last season on loan at Wigan in the Championship where he scored 12 goals in 42 appearances in all competitions. 

He has played once for United this season, in the 4-0 debacle at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup.
