Charlotte Dujardin admitted to a 'surreal' feeling after completing a remarkable clean sweep of Olympic, world and European individual dressage titles.

British star Dujardin, who also holds the sport's three individual world records with 12-year-old wonderhorse Valegro, lit up Caen's Stade D'Ornano with a brilliant freestyle to music performance.

A score of 92.161 per cent gave her gold by an emphatic margin from Germany's Helen Langehanenberg (Damon Hill NRW) on 88.286 per cent, while Holland's Adelinde Cornelissen (Jerich Parzival) took bronze.

Gold again: Dujardin added another medal to her tally with an emphatic gold in the Freestyle to Music event

Composed: The 29-year-old had already secured a gold and silver at the World Equestrian Games

It means that at the age of 29, Gloucestershire-based Dujardin is Olympic champion (freestyle), European champion (grand prix special and freestyle) and world champion (grand prix special and freestyle).

'It just feels so surreal,' she said.

'After London, I never thought it could get better, then last year we had the Europeans and now my first Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games.

Debut: This was Dujardin's first Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games and heads home with three medals

'To come away from here with two individual golds and a team silver, I can't believe it.'

A crowd of around 20,000 gave Dujardin a rapturous reception, and she once again delivered under pressure with a performance that oozed star quality in glorious Normandy sunshine.

'I don't think there is anything else I want to achieve on him (Valegro),' she added.

'He has already exceded what I wanted to do - way beyond that. He is just such a special horse.

'He is such a fantastic horse, and coming here he felt on top form.

'The rides in the grand prix (team) and grand prix special were just incredible, and then today I love the music we performed to and he just felt absolutely fantastic.

'I've had one bad ride out of the eight years I have been riding the horse - at Aachen (in July this year) - and who can moan about one day? Not me, that's for sure.

Champion: Dujardin also won gold in the Freestyle Grand prix Dressage competition in Caen

'With what I have achieved on that horse, and what that horse has done for me, he is just one in a million.'

With Dujardin and the British team winning silver on Tuesday, her freestyle exhibition completed another memorable championship and augers well for next year's Europeans ahead of the 2016 Rio Olympics.

Dujardin's colleagues Michael Eilberg (Half Moon Delphi) and Carl Hester (Nip Tuck) were eighth and 12th, respectively

'That was a good way to end the week,' Eilberg said.

'The stadium was packed, and you really feel it. I was just hoping she (Half Moon Delphi) would maintain her concentration and show some of the work I know she's capable of.'

In the eventing competition, about 60 miles south of Caen at Haras du Pin, it was not such a good day for Britain, the reigning team world champions.

Overnight leader and world number one William Fox-Pitt remains in individual medal contention aboard Chilli Morning, lying second behind Germany's Sandra Auffarth, but dressage scores in the 50s from his team-mates Zara Phillips (High Kingdom), Tina Cook (De Novo News) and Harry Meade (Wild Lone) means Britain have it all to do.

They lie fifth in the team standings ahead of Saturday's pivotal cross-country phase on a score of 142 penalties. Germany lead (116.9), with New Zealand (125.5) second, United States (138.8) third and France (139.9) fourth.

'I am a bit disappointed with that test as I know we can do better,' triple Olympic medallist Cook said.

'He warmed up well, but just got tense with the atmosphere in the arena and went a bit 'babyish' on me which caused a few mistakes that you can't afford to have at this level.

'The (cross-country) course is a true championship one with plenty of questions.

'From walking it, it walks very big and Pierre Michelet (course designer) has done a good job of creating rider-frightener fences. It will be a real test and challenge for everybody.'

Britain's two individual riders - Nicola Wilson (Annie Clover) and Oliver Townend (Black Tie II) - lie 16th and 21st, respectively, on scores of 46.0 and 47.2.
