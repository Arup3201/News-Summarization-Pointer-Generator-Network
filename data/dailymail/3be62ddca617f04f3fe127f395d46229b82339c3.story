Political commentators have taken issue with the fact that the design 'cost more
 than the average American family makes in a month'

Political commentators have expressed their fury over the fact that Michelle Obama wore a jacket worth $6,800 to the pre-Olympics Opening Ceremony reception at Buckingham Palace on Friday.

Though the dazzling J Mendel jacket and 
skirt won 
critical acclaim from the style set, some pundits are 
furious that she elected to spend so much money on a garment while so many in the U.S. are suffering financially.

A post on the Gateway Pundit blog read that the design 'cost more
 than the average American family makes in a month ($4,284)'.

Controversial: Though the J Mendel jacket worn 
for a pre-Opening Ceremony Buckingham Palace reception won critical 
acclaim from the style set, political commentators are furious that the 
garment that cost $6,800

'She does this as Americans continue 
to suffer through a deep recession and record unemployment,' writer Jim 
Hoft said. 'Michelle feels your pain.'

Regardless of the criticism, the ensemble was deemed a sartorial hit by style watchers, who had nothing but praise for the all-white look.

The jacket, which was almost armour-like
 in style, was embroidered in shimmering silver. The cap sleeves showed 
off those famously toned arms, while the high neckline kept the look demure.

Exclusive access: The jacket was originally available to pre-order at Moda Operandi, but if one were in the market for such an item today, they would be out of luck - it no longer appears to be on sale anywhere

The
 lightweight fabric of the sharply-pleated skirt made for a soft 
contrast, while the silver court shoes added polish, and co-ordinated 
with the look perfectly.

The jacket is currently available to pre-order on the Moda Operandi website. Given that it is from the resort 2013 collection, however, orders will not be dispatched to shoppers until at least October 10.

Mrs Obama, of course is likely to have ordered her outfit direct from the label well in advance of the event, and given her status, would have had the choice of any collection she desired

It was also in keeping with her patriotic red, white and blue fashion theme of the day, and proved to be a strong choice that saw her hold her own against the UK's reigning fashion princess, the Duchess of Cambridge.

Of course, 
Catherine did not disappoint. The fitted coat-dress, an custom-made design by young British favourite Christopher Kane, was an elegant choice 
that fitted her like a glove.

Mrs Obama arrived at the Buckingham Palace reception with of Louis Susman, the U.S. Ambassador, 
who hosted her morning Let's Move event at his London residence.

Style stakes: The last time the two women met, in London in May last year, the Duchess pipped the U.S. First Lady to the post in a beige Reiss shift. In turn, Mrs Obama went for a design by Barbara Tfank

The Duchess of Cambridge warmly greeted Mrs Obama, who had been invited in her role as head of her country's Olympic delegation.

The two women first met just over a year ago when the Obamas flew to the UK on a state visit.

The rest of the Royal Family were 
also out in force for a full-scale charm offensive on global leaders 
attending London's Olympic Games.

More than 190 guests were present - 
including 95 heads of state and government and their spouses -  ranging 
from Mongolia to the Marshall Islands, in the northern Pacific.
