It has been a long time coming but it seems summer may have finally arrived – for the weekend at least.

Today is set to be the hottest day of the year with temperatures soaring to 90F (32C).

After another miserable start to the week for many, with rain, wind and even severe weather warnings in parts of the North and West, the warmer weather will come as a welcome relief.

summer fun at the V festival

Sadly, though, it is not set to last – because rain and thunderstorms are due to return next week.

Temperatures in some parts of the country over the weekend will be up to six degrees higher than in Tenerife.

And it appears thousands of sun 
seekers will be making a beeline for Britain’s beaches – from Brighton 
to Scarborough – to take advantage.

Travelodge and Premier Inn have seen a surge in last minute bookings for the weekend.

Sales of disposable barbecues, burgers
and ice-lollies have also soared in an anticipation of the sunny spell,
according to leading supermarkets.

A forecaster from MeteoGroup said that
the scorching weekend is sandwiched between two unsettled weeks, but 
‘most of the UK will see sunny skies on Saturday and Sunday, with 
Saturday experiencing temperatures of 88F (31C) and possibly even 90F 
(32C) in parts of London and East Anglia’.

This would top the hottest temperature
of the year so far, which was recorded at the Olympic Park on July 25, 
at 88.5F (31.4C). And the mercury is unlikely to rise higher before the 
end of this year, the forecaster said.

However, he warned: ‘I would recommend
people to make the most of this weekend as sadly by Thursday 
temperatures will be a lot cooler with showers and thunderstorms a 
possibility.’

Only yesterday severe weather warnings
were issued because of heavy rainfall in parts of Wales and northern 
England, accompanied by strong winds.

And as the sun shines elsewhere today,
temperatures in Northern Ireland and Scotland will struggle to top 71F 
(22C), according to MeteoGroup senior forecaster Paul Mott.

He said Sunday could present a more unsettled picture across much of the UK, with showers spreading northwards.

However, he said temperatures could still reach 86F (30C) in London and 78.8F (26C) in other parts of the country.

The hot weather means a warm start to 
the Premier League season and a sunny third day of the test match at 
Lords between England and South Africa.

It is also good news for music fans on their way to the V Festival at Hylands Park in Essex, and Weston Park in Staffordshire.

However, following an increase in 
drownings during surges of hot weather, the Royal Society for the 
Prevention of Accidents has warned people to take extra precautions as 
they visit their local Lido, lake or beach this weekend.

Nathan Hazlewood, of the RoSPA, said: 
‘Among the hazards to consider at inland waters are that, even on a hot 
day, water can be a lot colder than you are expecting and there may be 
strong currents and underwater debris.’

Shark in the sky: Shocked Matt Barnes felt a sense of unease when he spotted a cloud in the shape of a Great White, complete with distinctive eye, fin, and menacing open jaw, at the beach promenade in Hove, Sussex

This was the jaws-dropping moment a cloud in the shape of a great white shark loomed menacingly over a holiday beach.

Walkers along the promenade at 
Brighton, East Sussex, stopped in their tracks to gaze at the sky and 
stare at the mass of white cloud that looked uncannily like the killer 
shark.

Quick-thinking Matt Barnes was able to take a photograph of the incredible sight on his iPhone.

In his picture, the shark’s 
distinctive nose and open jaws are apparent, along with a 
darker, circular patch representing an eye.

Although the body is perhaps a little fluffy for a shark, it does also bear a dorsal fin.

Matt, 30, said he was stunned by the unusual cloud.

He said: 'I was walking back from the beach with my girlfriend Jackie and our baby son Albie when I spotted the cloud.

'I said: "that’s a funny looking cloud, it looks like a shark". I took a picture of it on my phone 
and when I looked back at it, I couldn’t believe just how much it looked 
like Jaws. The head is a dead-ringer.

'The cloud definitely has the head of
a great white shark and it looks like it is looming out of the sky and 
about to attack the beach.'
