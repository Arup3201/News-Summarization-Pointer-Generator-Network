Shocking footage has emerged of an Ohio woman handcuffed and charged with resisting arrest after sheriff’s deputies pinned her down on the floor pried open her mouth to retrieve a Tylenol tablet.

Surveillance video shows Siobhan Householder, 35, of Akron, being confronted last week by a police officer after she took the prescription medication – the altercation left her injured and arrested.

Householder was in a holding area while waiting to make a court appearance when she took the medication for a tooth infection, she told the Akron Beacon-Journal.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Forced to the ground: Siobhan Householder is shown on the ground as the sheriff's deputy tries to force her mouth open

How it started: The deputy rushes over and grabs Householder's mouth shortly after she takes the pill

'It was terrible': Householder says her mouth was left bloody and bruised after the incident

The mother of three says the incident left her with bruises to her chin and legs, cuts on the inside of her mouth and hair loss.

There is no audio in the video, but what happens is very clear – Householder puts a pill in her mouth and the Summit County sheriff’s deputy bolts towards the woman to stop her from swallowing it.

‘He said, ‘What are you taking?’ and I said, Tylenol,’ she recalled to the paper. ‘And he said, ‘Spit it out’ and I said, ‘I can’t.’ I meant to say I can’t spit it out because I had already swallowed the other pills.

‘But I didn’t even get that part out before he just yanked me up and threw me down on the ground and was trying to dig these pills out of mouth,’ Householder continued.

The video shows the officer grab the woman while her purse and prescription pill bottle fall to the floor.

‘There was one [pill] in there and I couldn’t even get it out because he kept shoving his hand in my mouth and squeezing my face and pulling my hair at the same time,’ she said.

Pinned: He then pins her to the floor and reaches for her mouth

Watchful eye: Another deputy looks on as the struggle continues

Helping hand: A separate deputy then helps hold the woman down while the original officer pulls Householder's hair as he tries to force the pill out of her mouth

The officer then grabs the mother of three by the back of the head and tries to force her mouth open.

‘He was pulling down on my bottom lip and squeezing my face at the same time,’ said Householder. ‘He basically pulled my lip away from my teeth.’

More deputies pile into the room – there were at least five visible at one point – as the officer trying to force the pill out of Householder’s mouth examines the prescription bottle that fell to the floor.

They hold the woman down as one officer pulls out handcuffs and slaps them on her wrists as they frisk her.

‘They were acting like I wanted to escape from Alcatraz. It was awful,’ she lamented.

The search yielded nine prescription Tylenol and two diazepam tablets, police said. Also found were an additional 26 ibuprofen tablets the woman kept in a sandwich bag.

Householder disputes police assertions they found three additional unknown pills in a latex glove.

Finally over: Five deputies are in the room (one is off camera) as Householder is handcuffed and arrested

A sheriff’s office spokesperson told the paper that Householder was taken into custody earlier in the day on a warrant for failure to appear for a domestic relations case.

‘While taking Ms. Householder into custody, Deputy Vaughan witnessed her attempt to ingest several pills,’ said the spokesperson. ‘He restrained her for her safety and she was transported to a local hospital where she was treated and released.’

The bruised woman says she showed up to the courthouse May 8 on her own and was unaware she was in any kind of custody, that she felt free to take pills.

Householder was treated for a bloody mouth and handed summonses for resisting arrest and obstructing official business.

An internal affairs investigation remains ongoing, authorities said.

It is not clear if Householder will sue the department, and a message left by MailOnline seeking further comment from her was not immediately returned.

No drug charges were filed.
