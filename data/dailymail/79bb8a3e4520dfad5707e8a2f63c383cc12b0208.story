International tug-of-love: Jennifer Jones faces a custody battle with her Spanish ex-husband

A mother who abducted four of her five children in a tug-of-love dispute has spoken for the first time of the dramatic moment 15 police officers armed with Tasers stormed their secret hideaway.

Jennifer Jones, 47, went on the run with her two boys and two girls  to prevent them being returned to their father in Spain.

But after a nationwide search, police tracked her through her mobile phone to a guesthouse in Caerphilly, South Wales.

‘Four or five squad cars arrive outside and about 15 officers swarmed into the building with Tasers in their hands,’ said Miss Jones in an interview with The Mail on Sunday.

‘They put me in handcuffs...and the four children were taken away to a police station.’

Since that day last October she has not been allowed to see her two youngest children, Eva, ten, and David, eight.

‘I feel so terrible for them in particular because in my heart I feel I let them down because ultimately  I couldn’t stop their father taking them back to Spain,’ said Miss Jones, an English teacher.

And she revealed that four days before she went into hiding, she was told by a policeman that it was clear to him her children didn’t want to go back to Spain.

Miss Jones claims he told her: ‘I know what I would do if I was in your position – I would go down for my kids if it came to it...You are their mother and you have got to do what you think is the right thing.’

Last week she had the threat of jail lifted from her at the High Court in London where she was cleared of contempt of court charges for failing to hand over her children.

Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division, ruled she had not wilfully breached the order. Final custody is still to be agreed.

As it stands, two of the children, Jessica, 15, and 13-year-old Tomas, remain with their mother in Wales while Miss Jones’s eldest daughter, Sara, 17, lives in Spain with her father, Lieutenant Colonel Tomas Palacin Cambra, and her younger brother and sister.

Describing how events unfolded after her arrest when her ex-husband collected the children from the police station, Miss Jones said: ‘The only reason Jessica and Tomas were not handed over was because the social workers and a police officer who were present stepped in.

‘Jessica and Tomas were old enough and big enough to physically resist. I’m so impressed at how they stood up to their father that day.

‘The policeman then stepped in and told him to leave them alone. So he left with the two youngest, who by now were in the car with Sara.

‘If they’d been big enough to resist physically maybe they’d still be with me too. But by law none of the children should be with me.

‘The Spanish court order says they should all be in Spain with their father because in 2009 a Spanish court ruled they should be there because, in the judge’s words at the time, they are deemed to be habitually resident in Spain.

‘I will fight to my dying breath to keep them here with me and to get my youngest two children back, too.

‘Sara will always be welcome as well, but she is almost an adult now and she has made her choices.’

Following the collapse of their  12-year marriage in 2008, her ex-husband won custody in his native country of all five children in a legal process Miss Jones describes as ‘highly questionable’.

Last October, as the deadline for handing over her children loomed, Miss Jones received calls from the police every half an hour. ‘I kept telling them I didn’t want them to be taken before I’d got home to say goodbye to them.

‘To be fair, the police were extremely understanding and were not putting me under any added pressure. After my conversation with the policeman a few days earlier, we all went home and I sat the kids down on the settee and I said to them, “OK children, it stops here, I promise. You are not going back to Spain. You are safe now.”

‘Their faces immediately broke out into huge smiles and they started cheering.’

She claims the children have all testified, in written and verbal statements to lawyers and court officials over the years, to wanting to remain with her, but to this day the orders granting Mr Palacin Cambra custody of all five stand.

Mr Palacin Cambra categorically denies his ex-wife’s claims of ever mistreating her or any of his children physically or psychologically.

‘It’s incredibly complex legally,’ said Ms Jones.

‘I believe I have suffered a grievous miscarriage of justice but it is costing me everything I have, financially and emotionally, to have it overturned.

‘Because the order was granted on Spanish soil, it is almost impossible to have it overruled in the UK.

‘I have to fight it in Spain, but the moment I set foot there I am worried the children’s father will pull another legal order out of the hat.

‘I dare not return to Spain for this reason at present but moves are under way to appeal the original custody orders. But it is expensive. I’ve spent £40,000, my mother has remortgaged her house and John [her partner] has handed over every penny that he’s earned.’

Her blue-green eyes well with tears as she speaks.

Dark circles beneath them speak of the sleepless nights and strain she has endured.

‘Sometimes I just lie in bed in the small hours sobbing my heart out because it’s all got too much for me. I miss my youngest two children so much,’ she says.

For now, she has to make do with occasional phone calls to or from the children.

She says she has a ‘standing arrangement’ that she can call their father’s mobile at 8pm any day to speak with them, but, she says, the phone is rarely switched on at  that time.

‘I am certain David and Eva are too terrified to phone me,’ she says

‘The last time I spoke to any of them was on May 23 when her father had miraculously left the phone on so I could wish her happy birthday. Since then, nothing.

‘I try calling every night and so do Jessica and Tomas. It is so hard for them, too.

‘I know Eva in particular will be finding it so hard to cope because she only used to be able to fall asleep if she was holding Jessica’s hand. It hurts so much to think about it.

‘All I know is that I will never give up on them. Never.’
