A witness in the Oscar Pistorius trial posted a Facebook message bemoaning that his reputation was being 'destroyed' by the prosecutor - but vowed to mark the end of his testimony with a pint.

Forensics expert and geologist Roger Dixon has been called to cast doubt on the prosecution's account that the Paralympian deliberately shot Reeva Steenkamp during a fight.

But the former police officer found himself being repeatedly, and at times mockingly, accused of not being qualified 
to give evidence by state prosecutor Gerrie Nel.

After a bruising day of cross-examination yesterday, Mr Dixon wrote on his Facebook account last night that he was bracing himself for much of the same today.

To make matters worse - having told the court he did not 
have a television or radio and had not followed the 
state’s case because it was 'better not to be influenced by external 
factors' - his Twitter account was discovered, revealing that he had 
re-tweeted earlier coverage of the trial.

Credibility in question: The Facebook message by Roger Dixon, a defence expert in the Oscar Pistorius trial. He wrote it after being accused by the prosecutor of not being qualified to give evidence

Glib: Mr Dixon said he would mark the end of his three-stint on the witness stand by having a beer

Writing on Facebook, he said: 'Third day in court today. Let's see how much of my credibility, integrity and professional reputation is destroyed.

'It is difficult to get belief in those who will not listen because it is not what they want to hear. After that, beer!'

A picture of the message - apparently shown on a mobile phone screen - was posted on Twitter this morning.

Mr Dixon later confirmed the Twitter and Facebook accounts belonged to him.

He is also said to have told reporters during a break in the hearing that he had been inundated with 'hate mail' because of his involvement in the case.

Accused of being 'evasive': Mr Dixon holds a magazine rack as he discusses the sequence of shots that hit Miss Steenkamp when she was in the toilet

Mr Dixon has offered a different sequence
 for the shots that killed Reeva Steenkamp, contradicting testimony by a
 police ballistics expert and the pathologist who performed the autopsy.

However,
 he has appeared unsteady during his cross-examination as Mr Nel warned 
him it was irresponsible to 'try and be an expert' in areas he was not.

Mr Nel asserted in his 
cross-examination that Mr Dixon was not an expert in light, sound, 
ballistics, gunshot wounds or pathology - all areas about which he was 
testifying.

Mr Dixon worked 
at the police forensic laboratory in Pretoria until he left the force in
 December 2012. He was a specialist in analysing materials at crime 
scenes.

He now works in the geology department at the University of Pretoria.

Mr Nel also accused him of not answering questions directly.

'For an expert you are evasive,' Nel said, prompting the judge at one point to tell the energetic prosecutor to 'restrain' himself.

The prosecutor also criticised Dixon for not bringing photographs and his written reports with him and abruptly told him to bring them on Thursday.

'I said I will,' Mr Dixon snapped back.

'Good,' Mr Nel responded.

Nel ridiculed Dixon's finding about the sequence of the shots that Pistorius fired at Steenkamp through the door, testimony which contradicted that of a police ballistics expert and state pathologist Professor Gert Saayman.

'I use the word "finding" very loosely,' Mr Nel said wryly of Dixon's theory.

Pistorius denies pre-meditated murder. The trial continues.
