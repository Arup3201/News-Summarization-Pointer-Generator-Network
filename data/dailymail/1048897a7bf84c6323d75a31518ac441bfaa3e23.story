Gary McKinnon (pictured with mother Janis Sharp) has been warned not to visit his sick father in Scotland in case the US Attorney General puts pressure on the SNP to extradite him to America

Gary McKinnon has been warned not to visit his sick father in Scotland in case the Nationalist government allows a revived American bid to extradite him.

The Asperger’s sufferer was saved by a Daily Mail campaign in 2012 from previous attempts to take him to the United States for trial on hacking charges.

He is wanted for getting into Pentagon and NASA computers while looking for evidence of aliens.

Now, almost two years on, the 48-year-old wants to visit his sick father Charlie, who is in a Scottish hospital after suffering a stroke.

But the senior lawyers who helped fight his ten-year campaign against extradition have told Gary not to risk going north of the border to the country of his birth.

Karen Todner and Edward Fitzgerald QC said he should only do so if the SNP-run administration declares categorically that it will abide by the refusal to allow extradition by Theresa May.

The Americans were furious at the Home Secretary’s decision in October 2012. She said there was a grave risk that Gary, rated a serious suicide risk by doctors, would take his own life if bundled on a plane.

But there are now fears that the US Attorney General could try again as it applies only in England and Wales. If Gary went to Scotland, he would be covered by its separate legal system.

His mother, Janis Sharp, told the Mail that the Scottish Government had so far failed to give assurances it would turn down any new US request. 

‘I’d have thought it would be very easy for them to do,’ she said. ‘Gary is extremely upset.

‘It seems ludicrous that he can’t safely visit the land he was born in, even to see his father who has been hospitalised after a stroke.’

A Scottish government spokesman stopped short of giving the unequivocal backing the McKinnon family needs.

‘While we do not comment on individual cases, there is no reason to suppose that anyone for whom extradition was refused in the rest of the UK would necessarily see it granted in Scotland,’ she said. 

‘Scottish Ministers also have no power to act in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights.’

Mr McKinnon was due to be extradited to America in 2012 after he hacked into Pentagon and NASA computers while looking for evidence of aliens. Home Secretary Theresa May blocked the request at the last minute

Gary has rebuilt his life after his long legal fight, launching a company, Small SEO, a website where he charges to help businesses get mentioned in search results.

The US administration had been convinced that Mrs May would approve the hacker’s extradition.

The Ambassador in London was left fuming when he learnt of her decision, only hours before Gary was expected to be put on a plane.

Douglas McNabb, a lawyer who specialises in US federal law and international extradition, warned at the time that the Americans could attempt to revive the extradition if Gary ever left the UK.

The Americans have been determined to get their man, rebuffing repeated private requests from British politicians for Gary to be prosecuted in the UK instead.

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown appealed for him to be allowed to serve any prison sentence in Britain, the latest WikiLeaks documents revealed. 

David Blunkett also twice pleaded for Gary to face trial by video link.
