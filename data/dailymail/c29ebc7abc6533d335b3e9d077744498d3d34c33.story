Military action against Colonel Gaddafi is not working and hostilities must end urgently, according to France’s defence minister.

In a startling admission, Gerard Longuet said the Libyan tyrant must be welcomed to negotiations with pro-freedom rebels because airstrikes were failing to break the deadlock.

He also raised the extraordinary possibility of the dictator clinging to power in a bid to thrash out a diplomatic solution.

His apparent U-turn exposed deepening cracks in the Nato-led mission and were played down on this side of the Channel.

A source close to Prime Minister David Cameron insisted: ‘That is not our position.’

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 
‘Time is not on Gaddafi’s side: the diplomatic, economic and military 
pressure on his regime continues to build.

‘Whilst there has to be a political 
solution, Gaddafi’s brutal actions have stripped him of all legitimacy 
and he must go immediately.’

One military insider said: ‘It’s 
dispiriting when we are trying to keep up military and diplomatic 
pressure on Gaddafi and the French all of a sudden decide to sing from a
 different hymn sheet.’

Coalition leaders – including Mr Cameron – have made it clear the dictator must go.

But despite nearly four months of bombing raids against his forces and command centres Gaddafi stubbornly remains in power.

Speaking in Paris, Mr Longuet said: 
‘We must now sit around a table. We will stop bombing as soon as the 
Libyans start talking to one another and the military on both sides go 
back to their bases. We’ve shown there is no solution through force.’

Negotiations between Tripoli and the 
National Transitional Council, the rebels’ de facto government in 
Benghazi, should not be conditional on Gaddafi stepping down, he said.

He added that the dictator could remain in Libya ‘in another room of the palace, with another title’.

The development is significant 
because France and Britain were the driving forces behind the onslaught 
against Gaddafi, after the dictator vowed to exterminate rebels who 
supported the uprising which began in February.

Last month France admitted parachuting weapons and ammunition to the rebels.

Millions of taxpayers’ money has been spent on the military mission yet Libyan forces continue to repel rebel attacks.

Melissa Bell, international affairs 
editor for France 24 television news network, said: ‘It was always a 
question of Gaddafi leaving. The French were so gung-ho at the 
beginning, and are more battle weary now and realise the military 
solution is not as easy as they imagined.’

Tory MP John Baron, who voted against
 the UK joining the mission, said: ‘This seems to be the longest 
assassination attempt in history. The bombing of Gaddafi’s family homes 
is hardly within the terms of the UN resolution. What we need is 
diplomatic negotiation – more jaw jaw, less war war.

‘The French position also doesn’t easily square with the fact that they are dropping arms to the rebels.’

Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy 
said: ‘Some of these comments seem to add fog to this conflict. It is 
important our armed forces join allies to protect innocent civilians.’  

Saif al-Islam, Gaddafi’s son and heir
 apparent, claimed yesterday that Tripoli was already in talks towards a
 peace settlement with France, although Paris denied ‘direct’ 
negotiations with the regime.

Further strains are likely to surface
 this week when the ‘contact group’, which brings together the countries
 allied against Gaddafi, gathers in Istanbul on Friday.

The Ministry of Defence said British 
troops carried out successful airstrikes on Sunday. RAF jets destroyed 
an armed vehicle near the vital oil town of Brega in eastern Libya and a
 rocket launcher at Zlitan in the west.
