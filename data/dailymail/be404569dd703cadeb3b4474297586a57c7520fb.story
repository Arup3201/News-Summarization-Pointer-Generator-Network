A 26-year-old single mom in Pennsylvania has lost custody of her baby daughter after the little girl was found to have a blood alcohol content of 0.289 - three times the legal driving limit for adults.

Jessica Bachmaier, of Erie, said she inadvertently mixed made up a batch of formula for 13-month-old Nevaeh on vodka after it was mistakenly left in a water bottle in her fridge.

The working mother said she had asked a male friend to babysit while she worked and believes the man - who she described as a 'known alcoholic and drug addict' - had left the bottle behind.

Bachmaier said she is not a drinker and does not keep alcohol in the house, according to NBC.

Single mom Jessica Bachmaier accidentally fed vodka to her 13-month-old daughter Nevaeh - 'heaven' spelt backwards - that was left in her fridge in a water bottle

Jessica Bachmaier believes a friend who was babysitting her daughter - who she described as a 'known alcoholic and drug addict' - put the vodka in the water bottle

After unwittingly drinking two ounces of vodka, little Nevaeh was 'like a zombie' and a 'limp noodle', her mom said

She mixed a sippy cup with formula with two ounces of what she thought was water.

Describing her daughter after drinking the mix, Bachmaier said: 'Her motor skills weren't there. She wasn't cooperating. She was like a limp noodle.'

Bachmaier said Nevaeh - which is 'heaven' spelt backwards - was getting up and falling down 'like a zombie'.

She then passed out on the coffee table.

'I let her sleep for an hour and 15 minutes and then I took her to the hospital,' she said.

It was there doctors learned of the baby's incredibly high alcohol levels.

'I was very surprised as I don't drink,' Bachmaier said.

Nevaeh was treated and released for a Pittsburgh hospital, but was placed in the care of foster parents.

Bachmaier says Nevaeh is okay. She's been treated and released from a Pittsburgh hospital and has been to the doctor

No charges have been laid, but police are investigating.

The district attorney is also reviewing the case.

Bachmaier said she is now just trying to get her daughter back.

'I've been through foster homes and I've been adopted and that's all that went through my head,' she said.

'I know shes young and she doesn't understand.

'I'm scared or her and I'm worried about her.

'I cant sleep and I cant eat.

'I just want her to be OK.'
