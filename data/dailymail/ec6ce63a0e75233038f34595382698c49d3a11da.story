An Indonesian clothing company has come under fire over  washing instructions printed on its sports shirts which said women should clean the shirts because 'it's her job'.

Salvo Sports printed the controversial instructions on the shirts of Indonesian Super League football team Pusamania Borneo.

'Washing instructions: Give this shirt to a woman. It's her job,' the label reads, according to BBC.

Salvo Sports, the company that prints the shirts, was forced to issue an apology after the instructions went viral on social media

Social media was quick to shame the company, which tweeted an explanation of its actions.

'The message is simply, instead of washing it in the wrong way, you might as well give it to a lady because they are more capable,' the company tweeted on Sunday.

'There is no intention to humiliate women. In contrast [we want to tell the men] learn from women how to take care of clothes.'

The company has not said whether they will recall the shirts.

The shirt controversy caps off a rough week for the sporting industry, with claims of sexist behaviour at the highest levels of the sport making news. 

A women's international football match between Australia and England, played near a military base in Cyprus, has been overshadowed by claims British soldiers shouted sexist abuse at Australian players throughout the match. 

FFA Media Operations spokesman Adam Mark said a formal report was currently being prepared by the team in Europe, and it will be reviewed before any potential action is discussed or taken.

England's FA and the Ministry of Defence are also investigating the claims.

'We're waiting for the report before commenting. It would be inappropriate to say anything at this time,' Mr Mark told Daily Mail Australia.

The alleged incident comes just days after the launch of the 'Women in Football' campaign designed to promote equality in the sport and 'tackle sexism in the game'. 

Rachel O'Sullivan, a UK journalist for the Girls on the Ball website, claimed about 10 of the 50 soldiers abused the women at the game in Nicosia, Cyprus on Friday. 

'They were making horrible comments, shouting, whistling,' Ms O'Sullivan said.

'One Australian player, No.6 [Uzunlar], they were harassing her over and over and over again, throughout the game.

'These are teenage girls and they were sexually objectifying them.'  

Football Federation of Australia and England's Football Association are investigating the alleged incident, which comes just days after the launch of the 'Women in Football' campaign designed to promote equality in the sport and 'tackle sexism in the game'

Sophie Downey, who also writes for Girls on the Ball, said she had been hesitant to report on the comments.

'At the end of the day we are just two young women who just love our football and want to support our team,' Ms Downey wrote. 

'But we have sat through more than our fair share of women's games and we have never witnessed anything quite like it. 

Why should we keep quiet?'

She also said it was important to highlight such behaviour to ensure all fans understand it is 'offensive and unacceptable'.

'Until the opinion that it's just 'banter' and 'lads being lads' is challenged and dissipates, things will never change,' she said.

A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman was taking a more open approach. 

'These are teenage girls and they were sexually objectifying them,' UK journalist Rachel O'Sullivan, who reportedly the incident, said

'Until the opinion that it's just 'banter' and 'lads being lads' is challenged and dissipates, things will never change,' one of the witnesses said

The match, which was a friendly fixture, is part of the lead-up campaign for both countries ahead of the Women's World Cup in Canada in June

She also said it was important to highlight such behaviour to ensure all fans understand it is 'offensive and unacceptable'.

'Until the opinion that it's just 'banter' and 'lads being lads' is challenged and dissipates, things will never change,' she said.

A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman was taking a more open approach.

'Behaviour of the kind described is totally unacceptable and is not tolerated in the Armed Forces where abuse, bullying and discrimination have no place,' a spokesman told the Daily Telegraph.

'We are investigating these claims and if it is found that any UK personnel have fallen below the high standards we expect then appropriate action will be taken.'

The British commander at the game with the soldiers said he too had heard nothing.

The controversy comes after  fans at Manchester United and Manchester City abusing Chelsea club doctor Eva Carneiro were broadcast by the BBC on Thursday night, prompting the London club to call for an end to sexism in football.

The Asian Football Confederation also launched their inaugural AFC Women's Football Day on Sunday, hailing the events their member associations were conducting to develop and promote the women's game.
