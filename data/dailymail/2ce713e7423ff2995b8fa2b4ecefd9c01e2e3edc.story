A teenage girl with Down Syndrome has realized her childhood dream of becoming a model.

Karrie Brown, 17, from Collinsville, Illinois, was picked to star in a new campaign for the girls' fashion label, Wet Seal after a Facebook photo of her wearing items from the brand attracted public attention.

The image, posted to her Fan Page, 'Karrie Brown - Modeling the Future', garnered more than 200 Likes and saw her number of followers rocket to 18,914.

As a result Wet Seal contacted the teen and invited her to its California headquarters for a photoshoot.

'It was really fun,' Karrie, who describes her style as 'biker chick', told Today.

And her mother, Sue, said she was a natural in front of the camera.

'She was hilarious. They had her 
in the first outfit and she's standing there with the white screen 
behind her   . . .and I thought she was going 
to get upset because she didn't know what to do.

'She'd never had a 
professional photo shoot before. [But] all she said was, "Can I have some Justin Bieber music, please?" So they played some Justin Bieber and she just took off.'

As well as VIP treatment Karrie was granted an in-store shopping spree, a styling session with experts and a trip to Disneyland.

Wet Seal's CEO told Fox News that it was high school junior's 'enthusiasm and passion for fashion' that caught the company's attention.

As news of her modeling debut spread, Karrie's fans took to Facebook to congratulate her.

One wrote: 'I'm so happy for you Karrie! Follow your dreams and never give up! When you make one dream come true, make another... keep going and reach for the sky! You're doing amazing!!'

And another added: 'You are an 
inspiration to so many and you deserve it. Your baby pics even show you 
were destined to be a model...get Karrie'd away in Cali!'

Ms Brown, who set up Karrie's Facebook page, says her daughter's 
collaboration with Wet Seal marks a significant step towards diversity 
in the fashion world.

'There
are a lot of companies that talk about it and say they feel this way 
but when it gets right down to the wire they don't really practice what 
they preach,' she said.

'Wet Seal has been phenomenal. There was no hesitation for Karrie to come out there.'

Now back in Illinois, Ms Brown is focusing her efforts on
Karried Away, a non-profit foundation that aims to help young people 
with disabilities find meaningful employment.

She said that she's determined to make people see that her daughter is very capable, noting that 
many young adults with Down Syndrome have difficulty finding work 
outside the service industry.

Karrie plans to go to college after she graduates high school to study history and along with modeling, she also enjoys dancing in her free time.

Ms Brown says this is 'particularly touching' because when Karrie was 
first born doctors told her if she ever walked she would need 
assistance.
