At least one of 43 college students missing since September has been identified among charred remains found near a garbage dump, two Mexican officials revealed.

Tests carried out by teams in Argentina and Austria allegedly confirmed the body parts as those of trainee teacher Alexander Mora. 

He is believed to be one of the men captured  and murdered on September 26 in Iguala, Mexico, in an apparent bid by the mayor to prevent them from interrupting his wife's speech nearby.

The two officers could not provide more details on how many of the students might have been identified.

They agreed to speak only if granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. 

The families were given that information late Friday by an Argentine team of forensic experts working on behalf of the relatives and with the Attorney General's Office, said the relative, who also would speak only on condition of anonymity.

The teeth and bones were sent for testing at a laboratory in Austria, where the identification was made. They were so badly burned, many turned to dust when touched.

But officials would not confirm that, and members of the Argentine forensic team could not be reached.

The students went missing September 26 after confrontations with police in Iguala, in southern Guerrero state, that killed three students and three bystanders. 

The attorney general has said they were attacked by police on orders of Iguala's former mayor, Jose Luis Abarca, who has since been detained.

Investigation: Mexican officials have been searching Iguala, Guerrero, to uncover numerous mass graves

Abarca and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda were finally captured after authorities found them in Mexico City, Jose Ramon Salinas, spokesman for federal police, said on his Twitter account.

Maria de los Angeles Pineda is said to be the 'key operator' of crime in the town according to the Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors) cartel.

It said that as she was about to deliver a speech on Iguala's plaza in which she would put the case for succeeding her husband forward, she was told that a group of students planned to disrupt proceedings.

To stop this happening, the attorney general said, she ordered the police to deal with them.

Outrage: Demonstrators take part in a protest in Guadalajara city on December 1, demanding justice in the case of the 43 students that went missing in Iguala, Guerrero state, last September 26

Victims: The above poster shows the 43 missing students and offers a reward for their recovery more than ten weeks after the trainee teachers vanished after being taken into police custody

Police then allegedly opened fire on the students after they stopped the buses they were travelling in, killing several, and driving others away on the orders of Guerreros Unidos' chief hitman, 'Chucky'.

She was able to issue these instructions because she is apparently at the top of the criminal underworld tree in Iguala.

According to Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam, the cartel's leader, Sidronio Casarrubias Salgado, describes her as 'the main operator of criminal activities in Iguala'.

Forensic experts have combed through 11 clandestine graves discovered in the area during the hunt for the students. 

Detainees have told officials that they burned the 43 bodies at a dump site and bagged and scattered their ashes in a river. Authorities have detained more than 70 people in the case.

The case has ignited citizen indignation across Mexico and abroad for the fact that the students disappeared at the hands of a corrupt local government and that federal authorities took 10 days to intervene.

Tens of thousands have taken to the streets, some calling for President Enrique Pena Nieto to resign. 

The case has come to signify the abuse of authority and corruption that is engrained in the Mexican systems and that all Mexicans experience on a regular basis.

Another demonstration was being held Saturday, where parents of missing students were expected to speak about the identification.
