Now here’s a creepy bit of news: employers are thinking outside the box, going beyond offering staff the company car, bonus scheme, health insurance and workplace gym.

The offer — don’t all rush now, girls! — is of a bout of invasive surgery and a cold-store for your hopes of a future family.

Deep in Silicon Valley, where the best and worst ideas come from, we hear word that Facebook and Apple are offering female employees a hideous new perk.

Companies are going beyond offering staff a company car and now keeping female employees eggs frozen

‘Harvest’ your unused ova in your 20s or 30s, and delay motherhood until after your fastest-moving career years.

The company will keep the eggs frozen for you and pay the $20,000-odd medical bill for hoicking them out and storing them. Then, later on, you can draw them out, like a pension, and have a go at getting pregnant.

How’s that for a deal? Terrible, I’d say.

Big, ruthless companies always did have a knack for sounding generous while snapping leg-irons on their employees. Even lavishly gilded handcuffs can be man-traps — or, in this case, woman-traps.

It is not difficult to work out that the really cold thing in this equation is the heart of the corporate boss.

It seems that women, the pesky critters, are now leaving high-tech companies at twice the rate of men.

Presumably (though this may not have occurred to the management), this is because the intensity of the business is hostile to any kind of decent human family life.

Women working for Facebook can receive £12,500 a time for freezing their eggs so they work longer

One spokesman for a company offering this new service says it ‘cares deeply about our employees and their families’ and simply desires to ‘empower women to do the best work of their lives’. Well, one might diffidently suggest that there are other ways in which you can do this empowering thing.

Embrace flexibility, job-shares, distance-working, creches. Set up your own nursery and primary school on site — you’re certainly rich enough!

Or just take a more benign attitude to women coming back after a five-year maternity break, and be sure to provide technical catch-up and mentoring during that break.

These cutting-edge companies could pioneer fantastic ways of keeping mothers included in the workforce without ruining their lives or playing God with their biology and life plan.

But no: with absurdly touching faith in a newish technology, they decide to set up an in-house cryopreservation and egg-storage programme, so they can keep every young woman’s nose to the grindstone, developing apps or networked solar-powered cyber-baseball-caps or whatever.

And then, once the dear old thing is slowing down a bit, streaking past 40, creaking a little, running out of cool, young ideas — just hand over the freezer-bags and send her hobbling off down the mommy-track.

The technology for bringing forth pregnancies from frozen female eggs is indeed remarkable.

It was developed to help women with cancer, whose reproductive kit was about to be blasted by chemo and radiotherapy. That was a merciful idea, but even so it has never been a simple, pat answer. One gung-ho American doctor is quoted as saying it is a ‘tried and true’ method, and that wealthy parents sometimes pay for their ambitious daughters to have their eggs frozen for distant future use.

The eggs will be put in deep freeze so women can continue their careers, according to the technology giants

But think about it: the process begins with an operation, and probably hormone treatment. And then, years later, it isn’t just a matter of getting these ancient eggs out and hatching a baby.

It involves more hormones and in-vitro fertilisation, which itself has a limited success rate (ah, the years, the tears we have all seen friends enduring under this regime!).

And using pre-frozen eggs has an even lower success rate, according to latest figures — barely 25 per cent, if you’re lucky.

For any company to imply otherwise, when dealing with young, ambitious employees eager for promotion, is disingenuous. If not bordering on downright wicked.

Imagine a talented employee in her late-20s, looking at men powering ahead through their fourth decade, working stupid hours, giving everything to the company.

She wonders whether she has to make a choice between career advancement and having babies of her own.

She’s in a quandary. Her boss is holding out tempting possibilities. And here’s a company leaflet with some doctor, high on technology, blithely suggesting that she can delay the baby thing for as long as she likes, and have it all. Might she be tempted?

One spokesman for a company offering the new service says it ‘cares deeply about our employees and their families’ and simply desires to ‘empower women to do the best work of their lives’

Or, indeed, terrified. For — more sinisterly — who can guarantee that opting for the egg-freezing ‘perk’ will not become an unofficial prerequisite for a young woman who hopes for promotion?

Will the firm’s Welfare Department keep the list of freezers secret from Human Resources?

Or will there be an unspoken nod given to promotion of the egg-storer — ‘great girl, very dedicated’ — and an indifferent head-shake directed at those who are thought likely to get pregnant naturally?

Naturally! Because it is a natural thing, an ancient thing, this desire to give birth at the moment when it feels emotionally and physically right, even if not professionally convenient.

Of course, fertility technology — for those who truly need it — is marvellous, life-enhancing, blessed.

But never forget what a lovely thing it is to produce a child as a result of making love, of a night with a trusted partner in the drowsy or passionate warmth of your own bed, at home.

Who would choose, deliberately and in full health, to give this up in favour of operations, anxiety, dependence on white coats and sterile laboratories?

To break, unnecessarily, the link with thousands of years of our foremothers who — in the privacy of their own love — made new life and then confided its beginnings to their men?

So no, it’s not a perk. It’s creepy, and corporate, and dry-hearted, and impractical: a particular kind of silliness which, if I may be sexist for a moment, is quintessentially male. Schoolboy sci-fi stuff.

It’s also another example of something familiar in less exotic places and trades: the attitude of big business that hey, even if these damn women insist on joining the party, even if you really do need their talents, they’ve gotta toe the line, fit the template.

The little ladies, God bless ’em, must be ruthlessly fitted into a pattern and culture which has been set over decades by a workforce of males.

And, what is more, those males are culturally unaccustomed to paying much attention to their children, or indeed to their own mental health and human values.

Sunrise industries? Some hope. Sounds as though Apple and Facebook are embracing the old, musty principles of the dark ages.
