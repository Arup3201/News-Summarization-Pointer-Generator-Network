The boxing gloves worn by Muhammad Ali when he claimed his first Heavyweight Championship title have emerged for sale for $500,000 (£300,000).

The gloves were used by the boxing hero, then known as Cassius Clay, when he took to the ring against Sonny Liston Miami Beach, Florida, in February 1964.

Liston was the most intimidating fighter at the time and the match was one of the most anticipated in the sport's history.

'Part of his first step to sports immortality': These boxing gloves which were used by Muhammad Ali in his first heavyweight title victory over Sonny Liston in 1964

Up for grabs: The gloves were cut off Ali's wrists after the match by his trainer, Angelo Dundee, and they remained in his private collection until his death in February 2012

Clay, weighing in at 210lbs and Liston at 218lbs, fought for seven rounds before the former heavyweight retired and Clay was declared the winner by technical knockout.

The next day he changed his name to Cassius X but was called Muhammad Ali a week later for religious reasons.

The gloves were cut off his wrists after the match by his trainer, Angelo Dundee, and they remained in his private collection until his death in February 2012.

The leather accessories, that are in good condition but show signs of discolouration where the tape was, were then purchased by a private collector.

They are now going under the hammer with an estimate of £302,000 at Heritage Auctions in New York.

Chris Ivy, director of sports collectibles at Heritage, said: 'These are the very gloves that Ali wore when he claimed his first Heavyweight Championship.

'After the fight, Angelo Dundee used scissors to cut his hands free, and must have known they would be something cool and historical to have because he kept them.

'They remained in his private collection until he died and then they were purchased by another collector, who has decided to sell them as it's the 50th anniversary.

'It's hard to imagine a more important or evocative piece of boxing memorabilia.

'Ali is the greatest of all time, no doubt, and these gloves were part and parcel of his first step to sports immortality.

'Only Jackie Robinson could compete with Ali for the title of most influential figure in American sports history.

'But not even Robinson can compete with Ali in terms of being beloved internationally.

'Ali is a figure that transcends boxing or America, he belongs to the entire world.'

The auction is on February 25, three days after the 50th anniversary of the fight.
