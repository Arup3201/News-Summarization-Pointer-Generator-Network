Frank Lampard (pictured in 2001) is facing a backlash from US soccer fans after a New York tabloid republished details of him abusing US tourists in the wake of 9/11

Frank Lampard is facing a backlash from US soccer fans after a newspaper ran an article reminding people of a 2001 incident during which he allegedly mocked tourists stranded by the 9/11 attacks.

During the incident on September 12, Lampard and three team mates allegedly stripped, swore and vomited in front of US tourists stranded at Heathrow after flights were grounded following the attacks by terrorists on the World Trade Center.

The former Chelsea star and his fellow players were docked two weeks' wages over the incident, though the 9/11 attacks were not specifically mentioned by the footballers.

The New York Daily News ran the article yesterday, under the headline: 'British soccer star poised to join NY team once mocked Americans after 9/11 attacks.' 

The story was published just as Lampard, 36, is reportedly finalising a deal with New York Football Club.

The incident took place at Heathrow airport after Chelsea's game against Levski Sofia of Bulgaria was suspended as a mark of respect for those killed on 9/11.

Lampard and other players reportedly went on a five-hour drinking binge before returning to the Posthouse hotel where they abused guests.

According to The Telegraph, a manager at Heathrow's Post House hotel said: 'They were utterly disgusting. They just didn't seem to care about what had happened.

'We had a lot of Americans here and were simply trying to comfort them in their hour of need. Meanwhile these men were laughing and joking, taking off their clothes and abusing our guests.'

The players were fined two weeks' wages, around £130,000, with the proceeds donated to victims of the tragedy.

On NYCFC fan forums, supporters reacted angrily to the news, with one called Tom saying: 'This is a poorly thought out signing. If it happens.

'Trying to appeal to the city aspect of New York, and bringing in a guy whose "youthful gaffe" was about as appalling to New Yorkers as it gets, is tone deaf to say the least.'

Lampard is thought to be finalising a deal that would see him transfer to New York City Football Club for the start of the new MLS season in April 2015 after he departed from former club Chelsea

Yankeedom added: 'If you're old enough to get drunk and abuse American tourists regarding something as tragic as 9/11, hours after it happened, then you are old enough to deserve any ill-will people will have toward you.'

According to some reports, Lampard could sign for NYCFC as early as this week, though he will be unable to play until the start of the 2015 season when they will debut inside the Yankee Stadium.

Until then he may play for Melbourne FC, New York's sister club.
