Britain's oldest woman has died - two weeks after the death of Britain's oldest man.

Grace Jones, the last surviving Brit who was born in the 19th Century, was 113 years and 342 days old when she passed away peacefully on Thursday.

Her death - weeks before her 114th birthday - was announced days after it emerged Britain's oldest man Ralph Tarrant has also died, at the age of 110 years and 115 days.

Born on December 7, 1899, seamstress and civil servant Miss Jones was engaged to a soldier who was killed in action in the First World War.

She never married, and spent almost her whole life living in her council flat in Bermondsey, south London, doing her own shopping well up to the age of 110.

She stayed there even after a violent career criminal kicked the door down and pushed her up against a wall to steal £100 from her handbag - shortly after her 112th birthday.

Speaking after Jesse Coker, 46, was jailed for four and a half years, she said: 'He said he was from the police. After I opened the door, he pushed me and got my bag. I have been frightened ever since.'

The spinster, who outlived her seven siblings, added at the time: ‘I am so old that all my friends and family are now dead. I think I’m very lucky to have such good neighbours.

‘They are my family now, and they know it. They are very good to me.’

The committed Christian was admitted to St Thomas' Hospital in London after a fall a few weeks ago and moved to a nursing home, where she died at about 10am today.

Her MP, Simon Hughes, said: 'She went out as recently as this autumn, and was mentally as bright as a button with a brilliant memory right up until last Sunday.'

'Grace will be dearly missed by her many 
friends and neighbours and by the wider Bermondsey community.

Britain's new oldest woman is Ethel Lang.

Born on May 27, 1900, she was just 171 days younger than Miss Jones and also worked as a seamstress. She lives in a care home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire.

Mrs Lang left school at 13 and in 1922 she married William Lang, a local plumber.

She celebrated her 113th birthday in May in true English style - with a piece of cake and a cup of tea.

Her granddaughter-in-law Denise Bates told the Barnsley Chronicle that Mrs Lang had lived in the town all her life.

She told the paper in May: 'Ethel celebrated her special birthday quietly, receiving a birthday card from the Queen, and was visited by her family and friends who she enjoyed a piece of cake and a nice cup of tea with.'

'We are all
 very sad today but we pay tribute to Grace for her wonderful, vibrant 
and long life, for her commitment to her faith, her family and her 
community, and we know that a woman of such strong Christian faith faced
 death with no fear.

'Although she found her failing strength 
frustrating, right up until her last week Grace's memory and intellect 
were undimmed.

'All those who met Grace knew they had met one of London's most doughty individuals and she will never be forgotten.'

Today it emerged RAF veteran and retired insurance worker Ralph Tarrant - who became Britain's oldest man in January - has also died.

The sprightly pensioner also lived alone - smoking until the age of 70.

He did his own shopping and celebrated his 110th birthday in July surrounded by family and friends, putting his longevity down to scotch with a drop of sugar and hot water.

He had been one half of Britain's oldest married couple until his wife of 78 years, Phyllis, died aged 102 two years ago.

The pensioner died of pneumonia on October 30
 at the Northern General Hospital in his home city of Sheffield.

Speaking at his birthday this summer, he said: 'This birthday 
is absolutely impossible to believe.

'I’ve been told by many I’m unique, how the days have gone I just don’t know, it’s hard to believe.'

His secret to long life was 'a drop of 
whiskey, with a bit of sugar, with a drop of hot water to make it like a
 Drambuie.

'I’ve been 
very athletic and interested in health and strength from a young age.'

Mr Tarrant had two children, eight grandchildren, 11 grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.

Born in 
Nottingham on July 7, 1903, Mr Tarrant moved to Sheffield when he was seven. He
 left school at 13 and started work as an office boy at a local 
steelworks.

He became a steel inspector and served as a 
corporal in the RAF, then moved into selling insurance until his retirement - 45 years ago, in 1968.

He met his wife Phyllis in 1922 and they married a day after his 30th birthday, in July 1933.

They stayed together for 78 years, becoming Britain's oldest married couple. The pair lived independently together, and they loved travelling, shopping trips and lunch clubs.

When Phyllis died in February 2011, the couple had a combined age of 209.

His daughter Chris Carter said: 'He was amazing. He was very independent and very hardworking.

'I always considered him a fun-loving guy, although he was grumpy at times. He loved to walk, although the last month he couldn’t.

'He wasn’t going to give in, although in the end I think he knew. He was ready.'

Chris' daughter, Tara, gave birth on the day before the pensioner’s funeral last Tuesday.

She added: 'He went and gave room for another one to come in.'

Miss Jones and Mr Tarrant lived through several key moments in human history.

Miss Jones was born during Queen Victoria's reign and Mr Tarrant was born while King Edward VII was on the throne.

They lived through both World Wars and 22 prime ministers. When Miss Jones was born, Australia was not even a country.

The global Gerontology Research Group has a network of 40 correspondents who track and perform tests on the world's longest-living people.

Its director Dr Stephen Coles, based at the University of California, specialises in performing autopsies on those aged over 110.

He told MailOnline: 'They all have different ideas and some contradictory ones about their secret to long life.

'Some do say "it's because I drink whisky" but others say "it's because I never drink whisky". Some people say "it's because I smoke cigars" and we know that's wrong.

'We do a very careful analysis and it turns out there's very little, practically nothing in common between these people - different religions, occupations and nationalities.

'There's one thing that appears in all of these people and that's that they have long-living parents and siblings, and their children probably will be too.'
