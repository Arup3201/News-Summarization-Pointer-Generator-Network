A mother was almost blinded when her eyebrows were burned off during a routine visit to a beautician.

Care worker Natasha Henshaw, 25, was left scarred and in agony after a bungled appointment to have her eyebrows tinted.

The tint was applied after her eyebrows had been waxed to shape them, leaving her pores open to  the chemicals.

Mum-of-one Natasha Henshaw, a care worker, said: 'I went in to get beautiful and I came out looking like a beast'

Natasha was told that all of the soft tissue around her eyebrows had been burned and the dye should never have been applied to open pores

She went home assuming the pain would subside – but woke the next day to find her eyebrows  had ‘fallen out’.

Doctors have warned it is unlikely they will grow back.

Miss Henshaw said: ‘I went in to get beautiful and I came out looking like a beast, it’s horrible.

‘My doctor told me I could have gone blind had [the tint] been left on for much longer.

‘I have been in agony with them, they are so itchy, I just want to scratch them off. I have been in a lot of pain.’

Natasha Henshaw, 25, thought she would be fine after she went into her local salon for a routine appointment to have her eyebrows tinted and waxed

Miss Henshaw had the £10 tint and wax two
weeks ago at the Boudoir salon near her home in Dingle, Liverpool. The 
beautician waxed her eyebrows before applying a tint, but did not 
perform a patch test beforehand to check for an allergic reaction.

When Miss Henshaw woke the next day, she found her eyebrows ‘scattered all over’ her face and went to an NHS walk-in centre.

She was diagnosed with an allergic reaction and given antihistamines.

But two days later, the condition got so bad she could barely open her eyes and she went to see her doctor – who said she was lucky not to have lost her sight.

Miss Henshaw was told that the soft tissue around her eyebrows had been burned and the dye should never have been applied to open pores.

She was prescribed antibiotics, but the ordeal has left her nervous about leaving the house.

Miss Henshaw, who has a two-year-old son called Logan, said: ‘The fact I have no eyebrows has totally knocked my confidence, I don’t want to go out.’

Boudoir claims that Miss Henshaw, who had visited the salon before, had asked for the tint to be applied after the wax – a claim that she denies.

Salon owner Dean Foster said the beautician who treated Miss Henshaw had walked out on her job after the incident.

He added: ‘Clearly Natasha has had a reaction to the treatment and then picked up an infection. ‘We did not give her a patch test as she has had the treatment before. We will do anything we can to help her.’
