Paul Scholes has stoked the fires ahead of Manchester United's trip to  City this weekend by claiming that beating their 'noisy neighbours' is a way of life at Old Trafford.

Both sides have made an indifferent start to the season, with United trailing their arch rivals by four points in the Premier League after nine games.

Last season City achieved a league double against United with resounding 4-1 and 3-0 wins at home and away on their way to the title.

New Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has spent over £150million to try and address the balance of power this summer and Scholes believes the history of the fixture should be ingrained into the playing staff.

'Beating City – as United’s new group of players should know by now ahead of Sunday’s game – is a vital part of life at the club,' he wrote in his column for the Independent.

City go into the clash on the back of successive defeats suffered at the hands of West Ham in the Premier League and a suprising 2-0 home loss against Newcastle in the Capital One Cup fourth round - something Scholes believes is down to Manuel Pellegrini's side's arrogant approach to certain matches.

The former United midfielder cites the form of Yaya Toure as a key factor in City's mixed displays - adding that he thinks the Ivory Coast international looks disinterested in the Premier League champions' current system.

'My view of City overall has not changed. After a week which has brought defeats to West Ham and Newcastle there is something about them – you might even call it a touch of arrogance – that they do not have to take their opposition into consideration,' he added.

'I realise that it is a point I have made before, but I don’t think the central midfield is right, and that they are getting the best out of Yaya Toure. He still looks laboured to me, you might even say he looks a bit bored. He has the ability to step it up when he wants to, and that could be the case on Sunday.'
