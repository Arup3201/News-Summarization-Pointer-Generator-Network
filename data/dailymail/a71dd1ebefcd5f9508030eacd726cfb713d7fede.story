At just 16 years old, Gabby Douglas has already won a gold medal. But she is about to take her achievements to new heights, writing a memoir before most teenagers have even gone to their first prom.

The Olympic gymnast announced today that her 'inspirational memoir,' titled Grace, Gold and Glory, My Leap of Faith, will be released just in time for Christmas.

Chronicling the youngster's early life, the book will explain how she left her mother in Virginia at age 12 to train 1,200 miles away with a family she had never met, and her long journey to Olympic gold.

Olympic stories: At just 16 years old, Gabby Douglas has already won a gold medal, and now she is set to write an 'inspirational memoir'

Miss Douglas, who admitted she is teeming with excitement to meet Lil Wayne at the MTV Music Awards later tonight, toldÂ People magazine: 'Even before I competed in the Olympics, I always wanted to write a book'.

'[It] will also be about how much my family 
and I have overcome during our journey. It hasn't been easy,' she added.

Mostly, she hopes young people like herself will read the story 'and think anything is possible.'

No ordinary teenager, the 16-year-old 
joined Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson to lead the delegates in 
the Democratic National Convention yesterday.

Asked if she was nervous before her turn on stage, the gymnast said, 'Not really. I'm just going to go out there, be myself and have fun.'

Much like her turn on the stage at this year's Summer Olympics, becoming the Olympic champion in the individual all-around event.

HarperCollins senior vice-president Lisa Sharkey touched on Miss Douglas' charismatic and infectious personality.

She said: 'Gabby Douglas shines even more brightly than her Olympic Gold Meals. The reason is her inner strength and strong faith.'
