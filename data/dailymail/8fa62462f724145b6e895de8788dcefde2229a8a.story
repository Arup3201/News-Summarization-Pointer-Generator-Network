A waffle restaurant in Washington, D.C. has gone under, and is blaming Groupon for its financial woes.

Back Alley Waffles, which opened in April, said it was forced to shutter its doors because of Groupon’s sluggish reimbursement plan, co-owner Craig Nelsen claims.

His site now advertises $450 waffles to make up for the lack of money flowing in, saying that he’d ‘rather have my hand slammed in a car door than honour your Groupon coupons.’

Out of luck: Washington, D.C. waffle shop Back Alley Waffles has gone out of business, and co-owner Craig Nelsen, pictured with his dog Buddy, blames Groupon

Grievances: Mr Nelsen is now offering waffles for $450 at his shop in the Shaw neighbhourhood of D.C.

The restaurant, which was located in the Shaw neighbourhood of Washington, boasted a simple menu of fluffy waffles and fresh fruit smoothies, as well as coffees and chai. 

But because of Groupon’s reimbursement policy, Mr Nelsen lamented: ‘After taking a big chunk of the money as its share, Groupon holds onto the business’ share, using it while the business waits. And waits. And waits,’ according to Washington City Paper’s Young & Hungry blog, which first reported the story.

Groupon spokeswoman Julie Mossler told MailOnline that their payments to Back Alley Waffles were up-to-date.

Furthermore, she said, that only 18 per cent (or 132) Groupons had been redeemed, meaning that Groupon was paying the waffle shop 'aggressively' ahead of customers redeeming the deal.

Ms Mossler added that in most cases, Groupon buyers bring in friends and spend beyond the value of the Groupon.

Mr Nelsen said that he waited about a month for the first of three payments, saying that the money was issued as a check rather than being deposited electronically into a bank account. The check, he said, then arrived by snail mail.

But, he said, all of his operating costs – buying ingredients, paying rent and his employees – were due up front, meaning that Mr Nelsen had to put money he didn’t get until months later to pay for running his business.

Groupon spokeswoman Julie Mossler told MailOnline in a statement: 'Mr Nelsen initially approached Groupon and our merchant advisors structured a deal to best encourage overspend and help his business grow.

‘We also required Back Alley to cap the number of Groupons sold to ensure the feature was in the best interest of both consumers and the merchant. We scheduled his feature on his terms, on a date he selected, under a contract he reviewed and signed. According to our records, only 132 Groupons, or 18 per cent sold, have been redeemed since Back Alley ran two months ago, and Mr Nelson has received 2/3 of his share of the revenue to date.

‘We always hate to hear that a local business has decided to close, but the math does not point to Groupon as the cause.'

Mr Nelsen did not immediately responded to MailOnline’s request for comment.

Groupon demands payment as soon as coupons are sold to consumers. The company then keeps a share, and issues three separate instalments to the business, 25 to 30 days apart, according to the Wall Street Journal.

However, not all business owners are happy with the payment model. Mark Grohman, who owns Meridian Restaurant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, told the paper last November: ‘The payment timing is so erratic you can’t count on any of that money helping to pay your bills.’

He said that it was difficult to keep his business going strong because money is needed immediately in the food business for payments to vendors and staff.

LivingSocial and Amazon Local promise the full share in 15 days, while Google Offers says they’ll pay 80 per cent in the first four days, and the remaining 20 per cent over the next 90 days.

However, Groupon spokesperson Julie Mossler told MailOnline that many businesses prefer the 33/33/33 model. They added that many times, they are paid more, because some customers do not redeem the Groupon before it expires.

The former waffle restaurant owner told the Washington Post: ‘Groupon was a backbreakers. We couldn’t pay staff or get food or anything. The world seemed very dark at that point.’

Mr Nelsen’s restaurant was never free
from problems. Several reviewers on Yelp said that while the waffles 
were incredible, it was hard to know when the breakfast treat would be 
there.

One Yelp reviewer who went to the 
restaurant in July wrote: ‘Each time, I was greeted with a sign on the 
door that said “Re-Opening at 12:30” because they were out of waffles.’ 
The reviewer said there were always lines out the door, and even then, 
they were sometimes turned away without explanation.

However, Mr Nelsen puts some of the blame on himself. ‘I might have jumped without checking very well,’ he told the Post.

The $450 waffle offering is intentionally sardonic, and so far, Mr Nelsen hasn’t had any takers.

Other business owners found their Groupon deal less of a blessing, and more of a bane. Last November, the Daily Mail wrote of a cake shop owner in the U.K. who featured her specialty cupcakes at a 75 per cent discount.

Need A Cake owner Rachel Brown said at the time that the deal was the worst decision she ever made, and took a $19,000 loss in staff overtime and supplies to make the gourmet cupcakes.

She told the Daily Mail: ‘Even a much larger company would have difficulty coping, but my poor staff were having to slog away at oll hours – one of them even came in at 3am because she couldn’t sleep for worry.’

Investors were initially excited at Groupon’s IPO which, apart from Facebook, was the biggest in history. But the group deal site posted staggering losses to the tune of $42.7million.

But now, Groupon stock is worth only $7.38 a share, more than 60 per cent lower than its IPO price. Its stock hit record lows the week of July 11th, with analysts citing the Euro crisis as a persistent problem. 

The cut was also driven by a reduction in estimates for the company’s 2013 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The company’s estimated worth next year is now $718million, down from $930million, Reuters reported.

The system works as follows: subscribers log on to Groupons’ ‘deal-a-day’ website where they can buy a voucher that offers a number of daily discount deals on anything from restaurant meals to spa treatments. 

The U.S.-based company uses collective buying power to negotiate bargain-bucket prices with retailers, which become available only if a minimum number of people sign up.

Even though Groupon takes up to half the price of the vouchers, the retailers and restaurateurs participate in hopes of curating new, loyal customers.

According to a study earlier this month by Rice University, the daily deal industry is thriving, contrary to some reports. 

The study claims that these deals by discount sites like LivingSocial, Groupon, BuyWithMe, and Amazon Local bring in 80 per cent new patrons to the business.

However, the study notes that the daily deals are sustainable to only 30 per cent of businesses.

Here's our Groupon story:

Groupon promises to send you lots of new customers. The customers buy 50% off coupons (two waffles for the price of one, for example). They send the money to Groupon, which issues them a code. The customer brings the code into the shop. The shop gives the customer the two waffles, collects the code, and then 'redeems', or verifies, the code with Groupon.

Does Groupon then electronically deposit the money that the customer paid them for the coupon into the business' bank account overnight like credit card companies do? No. After taking a big chunk of the money as its share, Groupon holds on to the business' share, using it while the business waits. And waits. And waits. And waits.

After about a month, Groupon issues the first of three payments to the business. By check. Then it has to "process" the check, which can take up to ten days. Then it snail mails the check. A month later, the process is repeated for your next installment. Then, a month later, the process is repeated again for your final installment.

Now, keep in mind, the bulk of the Groupon activity (i.e., the big surge in customers) occurs at the outset of the Groupon campaign. That means the business has to lay out all the money (in our case food and labor) up front to service this expensive campaign, but it takes roughly a month for Groupon to send the (deeply discounted) payment for the waffles those customers ate.

And even then its only half or less of what is owed. The business has to wait for most of the remainder of its money until two months after laying out the cost of the food and labor. And for some of the money, it will be three months after honoring the customer's Groupon coupon in the shop before the business is paid for that customer.

That's the part that I didn't expect and the part that put our new business out of business.
