A suicide bomber killed 14 children in Iraq yesterday when he drove a truck packed with explosives into the playground of a primary school.

The attack took place at around 9.30am in the village of Qabak, around 260 miles north-west of Baghdad.

An estimated 90 people were injured, the
majority of whom were children, and the school’s male head teacher was 
killed in the blast.

Attack: 14 children were killed and 90 people were wounded in the attack near the Syrian border

Two policemen were also killed.

It is the latest in a relentless wave of killing in recent months - Iraq's deadliest outburst of violence since 2008.

The mounting death tolls are raising fears that the country is falling back into the spiral of fighting that brought it to the edge of civil war in the years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.

The Shiite Turkomen village, largely populated by people descended from central Asia, has a population of just 200.

The area around the stricken village has long been a hotbed for hard-to-rout Sunni insurgents and a corridor for extremist fighters arriving from nearby Syria.

Mayor of local town Tel Afar, Abdul Aal al-Obeidi, said: ‘It’s a tragedy. These innocent children were here to study.

‘What sins did these children commit? We and Iraq are plagued by Al Qaeda.’

More than 6,000 people have been killed in violence across the country since January, according to monitoring groups, in one of Iraq’s bloodiest periods for years.

Including attacks on Saturday there has been a total of 75 dead, including two television journalists shot on the job.

Today, another suicide bomber - this time on foot - blew himself up as Shiite pilgrims walked through the largely Sunni neighborhood of Waziriyah in the north of the Iraqi capital.

At least 12 people were killed and 23 wounded in that attack, according to police and hospital officials.

The Shiite pilgrims were making their way to a golden-domed shrine in northern Baghdad where two revered Shiite saints are buried.

On Saturday, a suicide bombing in the largely Sunni neighborhood of Azamiyah killed 51.

Later today, a bomb hidden in a car park exploded in eastern Baghdad al-Jadidah, a district that has both Sunni and Shiite areas.

That blast killed six and wounded 12, according to police and hospital officials.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the latest attacks.

The United Nations envoy to Iraq urged political, religious and civic leaders to work together to stop the killing.

Envoy Nickolay Mladenov said: 'It is their responsibility to ensure that pilgrims can practice their religious duties, that school children can attend their classes, that journalists can exercise their professional duties and that ordinary citizens can live a normal life in an environment free of fear and violence.'

United Nations figures released last week showed that at least 979 people, most of them civilians, were killed last month alone.

At least 135 have died violently since the start of October, according to an Associated Press count.
