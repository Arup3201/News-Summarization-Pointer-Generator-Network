Barclays have tripled missed payment penalties for their poorest customers to £24 per day.

A watchdog today warned that vulnerable people will be forced out of banking altogether because of the changes.

People with basic accounts were clobbered with an £8 charge if they miss three Direct Debit payments in a day but Barclays have decided to treble the charge.

Clobbered: The poorest Barclays customers will be hit with fines of £24 if they miss three Direct Debit payments in a day

Consumer Focus warned that many people will not bother to open a bank account at all because they fear being clobbered by the charges.

The watchdog said it feared the moves 
heralded a downward trend in 'accessibility and penalties on basic 
banking which could discourage the poorest and most vulnerable customers
from using bank accounts'.

The Royal Bank of Scotland have also 
recently told their customers with basic bank accounts that they can 
only withdraw cash at their ATMs and not those of the other banks.

Oliver Morgans, financial services 
expert at Consumer Focus, said: 'These changes to basic bank accounts 
are a backward step which could increase financial exclusion.

Poor squeezed out: Barclays Fines have been ramped up from £8 per day

'Living without a bank account can 
make it hard to live in the 21st century and can create financial 
penalties for the households who can least afford it.

'The Government already faces an 
uphill struggle to persuade customers to sign-up to a bank account when 
many people distrust banks and the charges they make.

'These changes will make that hill even harder to climb.

'Minimum standards are needed to stop
a race to the bottom for the poorest banking customers, and we need to 
see action from the banks and the regulator to make this happen.'

The watchdog are demanding minimum standards for basic accounts which include full access to cash machines, a free electronic payments system, buffer zones to cover small overdrafts and no large fees for missed payments.

A Barclays spokesman said: 'Barclays 
Cash Card account is and remains the leading basic bank account in the 
market across the range of features it offers and levels of charging.

'We offer full channel access, 
including all LINK ATMs and full counter access, for these customers and
are one of only two banks that make their basic bank account available 
to undischarged bankrupts.

'We want to ensure this product 
remains financially sustainable so that we can continue to help those at
risk of financial exclusion gain access to banking.

'We also want to ensure the product continues to meet the needs of those it is designed for.

'The changes we are making are based on solid research of our customer base and Citizens Advice Bureau clients.'
