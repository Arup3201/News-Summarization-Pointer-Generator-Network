She made her name writing psychological thrillers, including one that sees a couple struggling with the impact of an affair, but author Julia Crouch has herself been married for 25 years.

Despite ups and downs, several different jobs and the birth and upbringing of three children, the Brighton-based writer is happier with her husband than ever.

So what's the secret of her marital success? From spending time alone to keeping the spark alight between the sheets, she reveals how to make a long-term relationship work for you.

Long term love: Author Julia Crouch has enjoyed 25 years of marital bliss - and says you can do the same

Happily married: Author Julia Crouch has been married for 25 years and with her husband for 31

This year, the Old Man and I will celebrate our silver wedding anniversary by spending a few days in a luxury hotel in Venice.

But 25 years is not the whole story: This August we will have actually been together for 31 – it took us a while to get around to tying the knot.

We are practically unique among our friends for having such a long relationship. It helps, of course, getting together when you are very, very young (we were aged 19 and 21), but I’m often asked how we have managed to stay together for so long.

Clearly, the first answer is choose a good ‘un in the first place. But that’s quite difficult, because when you fall in love, you're always pretty sure you’ve picked the right person.

So take your time to see if it still feels right. If the other one starts giving you grief, send them packing.

Once you’ve established that, how do you keep that love going through all the curve balls life throws at you? I only have my own experience to go on, but it’s worked so far, so here’s how we’ve stuck together.

One of the main reasons the Old Man and I still canoodle is that we have pretty separate, independent lives, which means that we do not rely solely on each other for our happiness.

That’s not to say we’ve always both had fabulous careers outside the home. In fact, I spent many years when our oldest two children were little (they’re now 24 and 22), looking after them at home and working part time.

I have had many different careers, in fact, to fit around our children. I started off as a theatre director and playwright, became a teacher, did a bit of book-keeping, then I retrained as a graphic designer before turning to writing.

I’ve adapted and survived like this because the Old Man works in theatre and is away a lot. I chose to stay at home and earn a regular income while he went off.

Some friends have implied that they think I have sacrificed my career for my husband’s, but my reply is that I have really enjoyed everything I have done, and every choice has been made gladly.

I wanted to be there for my children, so that’s what I did, and I fitted work around them. It doesn’t make me any less of a feminist.

It’s not always been a bed of roses, though: growing up together as we have, we’ve had serious downs as well as ups – times when we‘ve really had to question our relationship and commitment to one another.

Happily for us, the outcome has always been positive, if sometimes hard-won, and the result is that, as we approach middle age, we know we are here by positive choice rather than passive default.

Then there's the importance of maintaining a physical relationship. Look away kids, but whatever age you are, sex is important in a long-term relationship.

Desire will come and go, and you have to appreciate that in each other, but I know that if it’s been a long time – say over a week – we begin to get irritable with one another. Only one thing is going to smooth things out, and I’m not talking about a nice cup of tea. 

But I think the main reason we’re still holding hands is that we share things with each other. We don’t have that big imaginary couples tally book where we owe each other favours: cooking, money, childcare.

We do what we can and we are generous with one another. This probably comes from being pretty much skint for our first 15 years together.

Sometimes I’d earn more, sometimes he would. We only had one bank account between us – well, it was more of a constant overdraft – and we threw all our pennies into the same hole.

It has continued like that to this day. We are both self employed and our income, if slightly better than it was in the past, is still sporadic. But whatever and however we earn, everything we own is owned jointly.

Some might say we’ve been lucky, and I would agree: we are not tied to regular jobs; we get to travel a lot, both independently and together; we have three funny, loving children; and we still love and fancy each other.

But, they also say that you make your own luck. The key to a long, loving marriage? You’ve got to work at it - always.
