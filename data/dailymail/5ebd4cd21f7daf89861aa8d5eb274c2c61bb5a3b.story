Baldwin was appointed kit man at Stoke during the early nineties under manager Lou Macari when the Potters were struggling in the third and fourth tiers of English football.

Stadium announcer Steve Buxton told the Stoke Sentinel: 'Stoke-on-Trent came to a standstill for an hour and a half last Thursday. He's a club legend.'
