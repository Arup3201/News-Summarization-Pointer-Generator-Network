An eight-months pregnant art teacher was left feeling 'victimised' and in tears after nightclub staff refused her entry during a friend's hen do because she wasn't wearing high heels.

Abby Ashcroft, 28, and the other
 nine hens, who were all on the guest list, pleaded for her to be 
allowed in - explaining that she did not want to wear heels because she 
was pregnant.

But she said a female staff member holding a clipboard at Club Liv, Manchester, told her: 'Fortunately when I was pregnant, I was still able to wear heels. You can’t come in.'

She has now spoken of how she broke down in tears after they told her she couldn't go in with flat shoes on.

Mrs Ashcroft, who is married and has a two-year-old daughter, has called the door worker ‘arrogant’ and said she felt discriminated against for being pregnant.

She added: 'I’m annoyed to say I cried. This woman upset me, I couldn’t help it. I’m not an emotional person. I don’t really get upset but this shocked me. I felt victimised. We were all sober and dressed well. It didn’t make sense.'

She added: 'Not to toot my own horn, but I did look very nice. Full make up, hair extensions, a lovely maternity dress, gorgeous jewelery, nails done. I really did feel a million dollars.

'When we arrived at the club there was no queue, however the clip board lady made us wait 10 minutes.

'Fair enough, I assumed it must be busy inside. During that time a few people joined the queue but were asked to leave because of trainers and jeans. Then after 10 minutes the clip board lady asked everyone in our party to put our hands up. I assumed this was so that she could let us all in together.

'No one else had left the club and I thought that was unusual as I'd assumed a one in, one out system, which would have explained our wait at the door.

'All the girls were dressed fabulously with designer dresses and accessories. The clipboard lady looked everyone in our group up and down and stopped at me: "You can't get in here with flats on," she said. I honestly thought she was joking, "I'm pregnant!", I said, and all the other girls chimed in.

'She laughed again and then said in an extremely arrogant tone: "Fortunately when I was pregnant, I was still able to wear heels. You can't come in".'

Mrs Ashcroft, who lives in Durham, said she had rarely gone on nights out during her pregnancy but decided to travel to Manchester for best pal Gemma Pedersen’s hen weekend.

But she told how she was left feeling 'subdued’ after being turned away.

Mrs Ashcroft, who is expecting a daughter in late September, added: 'It made me feel like I didn’t belong and should have confined myself to the nursery knitting cardigans for my new arrival rather than supporting my friend. I’ve never been made to feel like that before during either pregnancy.

'I was having such a nice time in Manchester. It’s such a big city so you expect people to just shove past you but everyone had been unbelievably friendly - holding doors open for me and offering to carry my bag.

'Saturday night soured that and put a dampener on it for the other girls as they were worried about me.'

Abby intends to complain to bosses at Liv, which opened in April and is the brainchild of Mo Mohamud, former manager of celeb-haunt bar The Circle, which closed last year.

The club declined to comment.
