Security officers at US airports seized a record number of firearms – most of them loaded – from passengers’ hand luggage last year while screening nearly two million travellers a day.

The Transportation Security Administration said inspectors found 2,212 firearms in carry-on luggage at checkpoints across the country, an increase of 22 per cent from 2013, when 1,813 were discovered, and a staggering 235 per cent from 2005 (660 firearms).

An average of six were seized every day. Of those, 83 per cent were loaded, causing delays for passengers, the TSA said on its blog.

Most of those caught with a firearm and ammunition at security claimed they simply forgot to leave their gun at home or place it in a checked bag.

TSA officers had an extremely busy year in 2014, screening more than 653 passengers (approximately 1.8 million per day), an increase of 14.8 million from 2013, and 1.7 billion carry-on bags.

The guns were found at 224 airports, up from 203 in 2013, with the most being discovered at Dallas/Fort Worth (120), followed by Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta (109) and Phoenix Sky Harbor (78) airports.

George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston (77 firearms) and Denver International Airport rounded out the top five.

The TSA said a new single-day record was set on June 4, 2014, when officers stopped 18 people from taking guns onto planes. That broke the previous record of 13 set in 2013.

Firearms can travel as checked baggage in the US if they are unloaded and packed in a locked container

Last year's find is an increase of 22 per cent from 2013 and a staggering 235 per cent from 2005

Some of the most stunning finds included an assault rifle with three loaded magazines at the Dallas Love Field checkpoint.

In another incident TSA officers seized a loaded folding stock rifle with two loaded magazines at Dallas-Fort Worth airport.

At New York’s LaGuardia Airport a 94-year-old man was stopped by security when he attempted to enter the checkpoint with a loaded .38-calibre revolver clipped to his belt.

In a similar incident a loaded .380-calibre firearm was found strapped to a passenger’s ankle after walking through a metal detector at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.

In addition to firearms TSA officers also seized a variety of weapons or unsafe items, including an Mk 2 hand grenade at Los Angeles International Airport.

The Terminal 1 checkpoint was shut while an explosive ordnance disposal team removed the grenade and transported it to an off-site location to be detonated.

Five flights were delayed more than two hours, affecting 800 passengers.

In another incident the FBI arrested a passenger after a homemade avalanche control charge was found in a carry-on bag at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport in Alaska.

Other dangerous items that were discovered include a fireworks-making kit, live flash bang grenades, more than 700 stun guns and live smoke grenades.

The agency also found a 13-inch cane sword in luggage at Charlotte Douglas airport in North Carolina

Another problem proved to be inert items, such as novelty hand grenades, that appear to be authentic.

The TSA said its officers are required to call in explosives experts to determine if the items are real, and that can cause significant disruption for travellers.

Often, terminals and checkpoints are closed during the inspection, leading to cancelled or delayed flights.

One such situation occurred at Tampa International Airport, where six blocks of inert C-4 explosives were found in a checked bag.

Officers found an 8.5in knife  in an enchilada at Charles M Schulz-Sonoma County Airport in California

One of the most unusual items found last year was an unloaded cannon barrel at Hawaii's Kahului Airport

The TSA also uncovered an 8.5in knife inside an enchilada in Santa Rosa, California, and razor blades hidden in a Scooby-Doo greeting card in Newport News, Virginia.

Under federal law, anyone who tries to take a gun onto an airline flight as a carry-on item -- loaded or not -- can face criminal prosecution and a $10,000 fine.

Firearms can travel as checked baggage, so long as they are unloaded and safely packed in a locked container.
