David Luiz showed that the good feeling of Wednesday's win over his former club is still going after posting an Instagram photograph with his younger Paris Saint-Germain team mates Mory Diaw and Mike Maigan.

The ex-Chelsea star played a key role in his new side's extra time victory - despite the Zlatan Ibrahimovic being sent off in the second half.  

Labeling them with his trademark #geezers, the £50million defender looked relaxed and posted the image with the caption, 'With future goalkeepers PSG.'

The defender has come under scrutiny from his former employer's fans after he broke his promise of not celebrating if he was to score. 

'I'm sorry for the emotion I showed,' said the defender, 27. 'It was difficult because I was so happy to win, but I was also happy at Chelsea.' 

Luiz scored a thumping header late in the second half to send the game to extra time before running over to the away fans and celebrating with the passion and emotion Chelsea might well wish they had.
