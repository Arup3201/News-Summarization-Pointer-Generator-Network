An attorney for the woman found dead in a San Francisco General Hospital stairwell disputed on Saturday a coroner's report saying her death was probably due to a chemical imbalance related to chronic alcohol abuse.

The medical examiner's office said Friday that Lynne Spalding, who was found 17 days after she went missing from her room at San Francisco General Hospital died accidentally, probably due to a chemical imbalance related to chronic alcohol abuse.

Haig Harris asserted that Spalding's death wasn't related to alcoholism and insisted that she died of starvation or dehydration.

Report: Police had the wrong racial description for British-born Lynne Spalding, 57, and waited days to share surveillance footage from the day she went missing

'To suggest alcoholism was involved is an outrageous, gratuitous comment,' Harris told the San Francisco Chronicle a day after the medical examiner's report was released.

Spalding, 57, was found in a locked stairwell on October 8. The coroner's report said she died accidentally and the cause was 'probable electrolyte imbalance with delirium' because of 'complications of chronic ethanolism.'

She had been admitted to the hospital Sept. 19 with a urinary infection, and she also had an altered mental state for one to two months and weight loss for two weeks, the report said.

Two days after she was admitted, she disappeared from her hospital room. Spalding was confused and delirious that day, the report said.

She didn't know the day or time or even why she was in the hospital, according to the report, which also said her laboratory test results were consistent with 'alcoholic liver disease.'

No alcohol problem: Lynne Spalding did not have an alcohol problem, says her family's lawyer

Discovery: Ms Spalding's body was still on the premises and was found by a hospital employee in a stairwell

Her decomposing remains weren't found 
until two-and-a-half weeks later, when a maintenance worker walked down 
the stairwell during his quarterly inspection.

Harris
said the mention of alcoholism 'demeans the memory of this woman, 
without telling us when she died, how long she was out there suffering.'

He said Spalding drank wine nightly and had suffered weight loss from not eating.

David Perry, a family spokesman who knew Spalding for six years, denied Friday that Spalding ever had an alcohol problem.

'Lynne was certainly not an alcoholic nor was she in any program that I was aware of,' he said.

Perry said he was disappointed that no time of death was released.

'The
only issue is did she die on September 21 or sometime later,' he said. 
'If the answer is she died after September 21, then her family and 
friends feel that Lynne Spalding was killed through the neglect and 
malfeasance of San Francisco General Hospital and the San Francisco 
Sheriff's Department.'

Investigation: A missing person's inquiry was launched after Ms Spalding first went missing

An after-hours call to the medical examiner's office was not immediately returned.

The
hospital said it has instituted a number of measures after Spalding's 
death, including daily stairwell checks and new training for security 
staff.

Several employees 
with the San Francisco Sheriff's Department, which provides hospital 
security, were reassigned after Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi acknowledged that
a thorough search was never conducted for Spalding.

At the time of her disappearance, family spokesman David Perry told ABC that Ms Spalding was on medication, which could have caused her to become disorientated.Â 

Ms Spalding, who was originally from the UK but lived in San Francisco, worked in tourism in the West Coast city.

She was divorced with two children, a 23-year-old daughter and 19-year-old son.
