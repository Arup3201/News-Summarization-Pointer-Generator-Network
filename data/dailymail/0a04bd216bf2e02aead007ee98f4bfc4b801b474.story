Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini was left unimpressed by the performance of referee Michael Oliver after his side's 1-0 win against rivals Manchester United.

The Chilean felt City should have been awarded three penalties at the Etihad but they had to rely on Sergio Aguero's 63rd minute strike after Oliver waved away a trio of appeals.

Aguero twice went down inside United's area, while Yaya Toure appeared to be caught by Marcos Rojo when clear through on goal late in the first half.

Speaking after the game, Pellegrini said: 'I think that first of all the most important thing is to win the derby. 

'During match I think we played very, very well. We scored and in that moment we dropped back a little bit more. We lost the high possession of the ball we had before. It's normal in the derby.

'Before that we played really well, we had clear chances to score and should have had penalties. Unbelievable. We can survey all those things and finally we won.

'One of the important things is to win instead of those things (the penalties), to not let it disturb your mind.'

City's biggest appeal arrived on the brink of half-time when Toure went down in the box after a lunge from summer signing Rojo, a challenge Pellegrini believes was worthy of a red card.

He added: 'The penalty against Yaya was not only a penalty but also a sending off. There were two others against Sergio. But I am not talking about that, the referees make the decisions.

'I don't want to talk about referees because I did it just once after the game against Arsenal. It's not the way to do it. It is a very difficult profession being a referee.'

Despite moving to within six points of Premier League leaders Chelsea, the former Malaga boss saw room for improvement in the way his side ended the match.

'We played very well until we scored the goal,' he said. 'Then we dropped to the back too much. But I understand the moment. Maybe it can happen once but it is not in the way we must finish games.'

Pellegrini also confirmed that the injury which prevented Eliaquim Mangala from playing is not a serious one, adding that the French defender could return for next week's vital Champions League clash against CSKA Moscow.

He said: 'Mangala has a problem in his thigh but it's not an important problem. I hope he will be ready for Wednesday and next Saturday.'
