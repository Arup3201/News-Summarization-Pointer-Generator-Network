Rarely seen photographs catch the normally reserved Jackie Kennedy as she let loose while traveling abroad in 1962.

Taken by her friend, photographer to the world's elite Benno Graziani, the black and white shots expose a side of the iconic first lady the public has almost never seen.

Jackie et Moi collects the most riveting of the photographs Graziani took of Mrs. Kennedy while on an official White House trip to India and while vacationing in Italy.

On holiday: Rarely seen photographs of Jackie Kennedy taken by Benno Graziani show a fun-loving side of the first lady

Close up: Graziani's unprecedented access to Kennedy shines through in the photos, which were taken while she vacationed in Italy in 1962, and on a White House trip to India

Graziani worked for French news and celebrity publication Paris Match in its legendary heyday.

‘Spend what you want’ and ‘live like kings,’ is what editors told Graziani and his colleagues. According to drkrm, where Graziani’s work has been displayed, that dictate came with the condition that the photographers produced high quality images.

That’s just what Graziani did, and his closeness with mid-century luminaries helped boost his work.

During his career, he became friends with stars like Kirk Douglas, Audrey Hepburn, Charlie Chaplin, Jane Fonda, Brigitte Bardot, and Grace Kelly.

Old friends: Jackie et Moi shows the closeness shared by Kennedy and Graziani, who met while she was a reporter named Jackie Bouvier

'Benno is a lot of fun, but he¿s always got a camera in his hand': President Kennedy worried Graziani might be a little too close to Kennedy and the public would see wine drinking, bikini-clad side of her that would hurt his reputation

Good life: Graziani worked for Paris Match, where he was urged to live the good life right along with his subjects so long as he produced excellent photographs, which he did

Repose: This photo was taken in Ravello, Italy in 1962 during a trip that Kennedy took with her sister

But his friendship with Jackie Kennedy allowed him a different sort of access, to a hybrid Hollywood celebrity and Washington star.

‘Benno is a lot of fun, but he’s always got a camera in his hand,’ the late John F. Kennedy warned Secret Service assigned to his wife during her time abroad.

The president feared a backlash if the paparazzo’s photos showed the first lady having one glass of wine too many or showing too much skin while in Europe.

Biggest star: Graziani was friends with other luminaries of the 50s, 60s, and 70s like Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn but his rapport with Kennedy gave him access to a even more storied world than Hollywood

Coiffed: Kennedy appears surprised as he checks out her hair in the mirror. Few photographers would be allowed to catch such a vulnerable moment

The photos are nothing if not tasteful, however. Jackie exhibits a tranquility and ease that cannot be so easily seen in photos where she wears suits and her signature pillbox hat.

She is as stunning in her swimwear as she ever was in Chanel and Graziani's closeness with the mercurial first lady is evident in every photo and grants the viewer the same unprecedented access as the photographer.

Kennedy and Graziani met while she was still a Bouvier.

It was the 1950s and the young Jackie was a reporter for the Washington Times-Herald.

‘She began as a reporter-photographer and led a truly exceptional life, a fairy tale transformed into Greek tragedy. Today she is part of history,’ Graziani said. ‘There are people who make history, those who endure it, and there are those who tell about it. That's me.’

Jackie et 'Moi' shows September 7 through 28 at the Los Angeles exhibition space drkrm.

At ease: Kennedy exhibits the same poise in Graziani's photos that can be seen in all photos of her, but with an added glint in her eyes that can't well be described

Cheese: Even buttoned up, she let loose in front of Graziani's lens and showed a rarely seen playful side
