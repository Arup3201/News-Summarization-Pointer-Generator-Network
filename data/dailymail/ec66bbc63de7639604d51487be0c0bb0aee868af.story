A fossil of a squirrel-like creature, described as a 'great-great-grand uncle 165 million years removed' of modern man, has been discovered in China.

The ancient mammalian relative, called Megaconus mammaliaformis, is one of the best-preserved fossils of
the mammaliaform groups, which are long-extinct relatives to modern 
mammals.

The discovery in Inner Mongolia has also provided evidence that traits such as hair and fur originated well before the rise of the first true mammals.

The earliest evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of Castorocauda, from 164 million years ago in the Middle Jurassic.

During the 1950s scientists suggested that the passages in the front of the upper jawbones of the Castorocauda were channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to whiskers.

This is thought to have been the first evidence of hair or fur.

More recent research claims that the passages don't prove that the animal had whiskers because modern-day lizards have almost identical facial structures.

Believed to date back around 165 million years, Megaconus co-existed with feathered dinosaurs in the Jurassic era, nearly 100 million years before Tyrannosaurus Rex roamed Earth.

Zhe-Xi Luo, professor of organismal biology and anatomy at the University 
of Chicago said: 'We finally have a glimpse of 
what may be the ancestral condition of all mammals, by looking at what 
is preserved in Megaconus.

'It allows us to piece together poorly understood details of the 
critical transition of modern mammals from pre-mammalian ancestors.'

Preserved in the fossil is a halo of guard hairs and underfur 
residue, making Megaconus only the second known pre-mammalian fossil 
with fur. It was also found with sparse hairs around its abdomen.

On its heel, Megaconus had a long spur made from a tough protein substance which was thought to have been poisonous.

Similar to those found on modern egg-laying mammals,
such as male platypuses, this spur is evidence that this fossil was most
likely a male member of its species.

Researchers have described the Megaconus as being similar to modern-day squirrels, pictured. The fossil was found with sparse hairs on the animal's abdomen and fur around the top of the creature. This makes Megaconus only the second known pre-mammalian fossil to have fur

Professor Luo said: 'Megaconus confirms that many modern mammalian 
biological functions related to skin and integument had already evolved 
before the rise of modern mammals.'

The biological features of Megaconus are described by scientists from the University of Chicago in the journal Nature.

A terrestrial animal about the size of a large ground squirrel, Megaconus was likely an omnivore, possessing clearly mammalian dental features and jaw hinge.

Its molars had elaborate rows of cusps for chewing on plants, and some of its anterior teeth possessed large cusps that allowed it to eat insects and worms, perhaps even other small vertebrates.

It had teeth with high crowns and fused roots similar to more modern, but unrelated, mammalian species such as rodents. Its high-crowned teeth also appeared to be slow growing like modern placental mammals.

The skeleton of the Megaconus, and in particular its hind-leg bones and finger claws would have given the animals a gait similar to modern armadillos, pictured. a previously unknown type of movement in mammaliaforms

The skeleton of Megaconus - especially its hind-leg bones and finger claws - likely gave it a gait similar to modern armadillos, a previously unknown type of movement in mammaliaforms.

Prof Luo and his team identified clearly non-mammalian characteristics such as its primitive middle ear, still attached to the jaw, is often seen in reptiles.Â 

The Megaconus' anklebones and vertebral column are also similar to the anatomy of previously known mammal-like reptiles.

Professor Luo said: 'We cannot say that Megaconus is our direct ancestor, but it certainly looks like a great-great-grand uncle 165 million years removed.

'These features are evidence of what our mammalian ancestor looked like during the Triassic-Jurassic transition.

'Megaconus shows that many adaptations found in modern mammals were already tried by our distant, extinct relatives.

'In a sense, the three big branches of modern mammals are all accidental survivors among many other mammaliaform lineages that perished in extinction.'

The fossil is now in the collections in Paleontological Museum of Liaoning in China.
