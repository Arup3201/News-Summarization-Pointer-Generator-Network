With the Royal birth just days away, it seems that a baby has become the must-have modern accessory.

As a result, the 
range of novelty products on the market for babies is ever expanding.

But from diamante dummies to moustache-themed pacifiers, the abundance of baby accessories is fast becoming more and more ridiculous.

And the latest crazy baby accessory to hit the market? A wig for fashion-forward baby girls who have no hair but want to make sure no one thinks they're a little boy.

The latest must-have accessory? Baby Bangs! are a new wig for baby girls who want to be fashion-forward and differentiate themselves from boys

Baby Bangs! is the 
brainchild of a mother and daughter who wanted to create a miniature hair piece 
suitable for newborns to wear.

Writing on their website, they say: 'At Baby Bangs! we believe in the beauty of childhood.

'Our unique designs are sprinkled with magic- inspiring a world of whimsical wonder and mystical magical memorable moments for you and your baby girl to cherish forever!

'For she is, and always will be, your little princess!.'

The design trio called in hair replacement artist, Lisa Griggs-Campbell, as well as a real live baby model for styling, sizing and 
comfort testing.

After two years of designing, they unveiled the 'Fleurs Collection', a collection of miniature hair pieces in a range of colours made size-appropriate for infants, 
toddlers and little girls priced at around £20.

And it seems that Baby Bangs! aren't being well received.

Callie Beusman writes on Jezebel: 'So the princess dogma is starting at such a young age that a newborn's natural (downy-headed) state is somehow undesirable?

'Is the window of time during which a
woman's physical appearance isn't subjected to constant scrutiny and 
held up to strict standards going to narrow so much that all fetuses 
will need beautiful virtual makeovers.

'Babies
all look the same; that's kind of their thing. It's not only 
unnecessary, but also pretty much insane, to start forcing cosmetic 
enhancements on a child too young to even have hair on her head.'

And the Twittersphere are also up in arms about the latest baby accessory.

user wrote: 'I despair... RT"@pandy92: There's a website selling wigs 
for baby girls so they don't get mistaken for baby boys.'

Another added: '*Projectile vomit* RT @mssusieday 'I'm not a boy!' AAAAARGH. RT @sarahcrossan: No no no no no. http://baby-bangs.com/index2.php'
