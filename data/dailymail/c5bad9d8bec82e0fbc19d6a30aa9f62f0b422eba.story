Four years after the mysterious shooting death of his mistress, former Mobile County, Alabama Commissioner Stephen Nodine, 51, is a free man. 

Nodine was released from jail Monday morning, two years after  pleading guilty to a perjury charge in exchange for prosecutors dropping their murder case against him in the death of girlfriend Angel Downs, 45.

The disgraced public official held a press conference Monday afternoon, where he took partial responsibility for Downs' death while continuing to insist he's not a murderer.

'My actions were wrong,' said Nodine. 'I should not have carried on an affair. This was my moral fault and I take full responsibility for the things that I've done.'

'I think about [Angel] every day of my life. I know my actions contributed to her death, unfortunately, and I have to take responsibility for that.'

But Downs' family is still not buying Nodine's story, and issued a statement of their own on his release Monday morning. 

'Our family still believes 100 per cent that Stephen Nodine murdered Angel,' Downs' sister Susan Bloodworth said. 'While we may not see justice for Angel here on earth, we know that justice will be served in the end, by God!'

Suspicion: Downs' family issued a statement on Nodine's release on Monday, saying they still believe he's guilty of her murder. 'Our family still believes 100  per cent that Stephen Nodine murdered Angel,' her sister Susan Bloodworth wrote 

Nodine was the primary suspect in Downs' death when she was found shot in the head in the driveway of her Gulf Shores home on May 9, 2010. 

He was initially charged with Downs' murder, but that trial ended in a hung jury in December 2010 when experts testified that Downs could have been murdered or committed suicide. On the eve of his retrial in 2012, Nodine struck a deal with prosecutors, agreeing to plead guilty to a perjury charge in exchange for the murder and stalking case being dropped.  The perjury charge stemmed from his attempt to get a public defender, when he could afford to pay his own attorney.

He entered jail shortly after he was sentenced in October 2012. Overall, Nodine served two years of the 10-year sentence on the perjury charge.

Nodine also served time for harassment and an ethics violation related to use of his county-owned car. Another year was served for owning two guns while taking illegal drugs. He says one of the most beneficial parts of jail time was that it helped him get sober.  

Nodine was released from Bay Minette jail shortly before 7am and he spent his first day of freedom bonding with his 18-year-old son Christopher.

Father and son reunited: Nodine's son Christopher was just 14 years old when he was first arrested in connection to Downs' murder. He says he regretted not getting to teach his son how to drive, or see his recent high school graduation

Christopher was just 14 when his father was initially arrested for Downs' murder and Nodine says he regrets not being around to teach his son to drive and see him graduate from high school. 

'He's never wavered,' Nodine told AL.com. 'Some kids might have gone in a different direction.'

He talked little of Christopher's mother, who divorced him after Downs was found death. He called her a 'super person'. 

On Monday, the father and son went golfing and Nodine got the opportunity to eat 'real food for the first time in a long time' when he chowed down on a black-and-blue burger. 

Nodine also took the time to pray at  the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception for everyone he 'hurt' including Downs' family. 

Nodine will remain on federal and state probation for the next three years. He plans to stay in the Mobile-Baldwin area, and is working on a book about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. 

'I have to find a job,' said Nodine. 'I hope people realize that people make mistakes in their lives and have forgiveness as I forgive those who wrongfully prosecuted me.'
