An Iraq War veteran who saved the lives of 30 comrades was cheered on by thousands today as he carried the Olympic Torch on Armed Forces Day.

Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry, 32, who was awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery, took the flame up the steps of the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, the UK's centre of remembrance.

He paused to salute his fellow soldiers as about 6,000 people, including service personnel and their families, applauded and waved Union flags.

The ceremony was one of more than 100 events, ranging from veterans' parades and bands to barbecues and fairs, taking place across the country to pay tribute to Britain's war heroes 
and mark Armed Forces Day.

'Emotional': L/Cpl Beharry took the flame up the steps of the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, the UK's centre of remembrance

Thirty thousand poppies were dropped on the crowd by a paraglider flown by Major Alastair Macartney from Jump4Heroes, a charity which helps the Armed Forces as part of the Royal British Legion.

L/Cpl Beharry said: 'It was very emotional (carrying the torch) because of the reason why I am here - to see the turnout is amazing and being here on Armed Forces Day as well.

'Armed Forces Day is important to see the general public is behind us and support us for what we do.'

The Caribbean-born hero said he hoped to watch a few events at the Olympics.

In 2004 L/Cpl Beharry became the first living person for 35 years to receive the Victoria Cross, which is the highest military honour for valour.

He earned the honour for saving the lives of 30 comrades by charging down an ambush and has since overcome terrible wounds to continue his military career.

The Band of the Irish Regiment and members of the 2 Mercian Regiment followed L/Cpl Beharry as he walked up the steps to the memorial site.

The Mercian Ram, Lance Corporal Derby, mascot of the 2 Mercian Regiment, was also there.

Michael Hawkins, 71, from Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, was among the former servicemen who travelled to the event.

Mr Hawkins, who served in the RAF for 36 years, and attended with his wife Gill, 61, said: 'I came here today because I thought it was very important on Armed Forces Day to do something that I consider significant, to come here to the National Arboretum, but in particular to see Johnson Beharry.'

Tribute: The torch-bearing was one of many events held across the country today to celebrate Britain's war heroes and mark Armed Forces Day

He added: 'Today is a hugely important day for our Armed Forces. The Armed Forces serve the Crown, their country and their regiment.

'They do it every day, they do it because they want to do it.

'I honestly believe it is one of the last institutions in the country that still shows the right moral values.'

L/Cpl Beharry is one of 8,000 people who have been chosen to carry the torch on an 8,000-mile, 70-day journey to the Olympic opening ceremony on July 27.

In Plymouth, crowds lined the streets to cheer on the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force bands as more than 1,200 servicemen and women, veterans and cadets marched through the city.

The Royal Navy type-23 frigate HMS Argyll was then set to sail through Plymouth Sound to fire a 21-gun salute.

Prime Minister David Cameron and the Earl of Wessex were among the guests at the celebrations in Devon.

Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, said he was delighted at the support given by the thousands of well-wishers.

He added: 'People across the country from all ages and backgrounds have a deep respect and appreciation for the Armed Forces, and Armed Forces Day is an excellent opportunity for us all to let our men and women realise how much they are appreciated.

'It is from our society that our Armed Forces are drawn and from our society that we draw our strength.'

More than Â£10million is to be pumped into creating 100 cadet units in schools, the Government announced on Armed Forces Day.

The move will enable more young people to join military-themed youth organisations and take pride in their community.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) and Department for Education (DfE) revealed they had committed the money for 100 new units across state-funded schools in England by 2015.

The money will go towards essential equipment and training of staff.

Interested schools will need to show they can get adult volunteers and third-party funding to maintain the units.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'Cadet forces offer a great opportunity to gain life skills and we are determined to ensure that we open that opportunity up to as many young people as possible.

'The funding announced by the Government today will kickstart an exciting new phase in the development of our cadet forces - fostering greater social mobility and raising awareness of the values and ethos of our Armed Forces among local communities.'

Education Secretary Michael Gove said: 'Cadet forces provide an exciting and challenging way for young people to learn teamwork, self-discipline and respect.

'They have made a hugely positive impact, especially in boosting standards and discipline.

'By extending the scheme in state schools, more young people can benefit from the cadet experience.

'It will help them develop into well-rounded, accomplished adults fully prepared for life beyond school.

'We know many schools with cadet forces have a partnership or collaboration arrangements with neighbouring schools to allow more young people to take part.

'We want to see more partnerships to allow schools to share their expertise and facilities for the benefit of all.'

There are four major MoD-sponsored cadet forces - the school-based Combined Cadet Force and the community-based Sea Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Force and Air Training Corps.

Between them 26,000 adult volunteers deliver training to 140,000 young people a year.

There are 3,280 cadet units across all four cadet forces in the UK, 324 of which are in state schools.
