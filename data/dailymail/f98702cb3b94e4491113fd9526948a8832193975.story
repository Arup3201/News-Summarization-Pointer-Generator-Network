A drunk prankster has been caught on video going for a swim - in a hotel's tropical fish tank.

The intoxicated guest was caught on film in the upmarket hotel lobby climbing fully-clothed into the 12,000-litre glass tank filled with exotic sealife.

He then swims and paddles around - as his friends film him on a phone and can be heard laughing and giggling in the background at the Radisson Blu hotel in Jersey.

But the unidentified prankster's joke does not amuse everyone - and an angry member of staff soon cuts the 'fun' short

The joker - named only as Matt - was then frogmarched away as his sniggering friends made off

The man - who is referred to as Matt - went for a dip in the 6ft tank while staying at the four-star hotel.

But it seems not everyone was as amused by the gag and the fun was soon brought to an member of hotel staff who can be heard shouting: 'What are you f***ing doing?'

As the joker finally clambers out of the tank, dripping wet, the furious male employee frogmarches him towards the exit, as his friends urge him: 'quick go'.

Bosses at the waterfront St. Helier hotel, in Jersey- where rooms cost up to Â£184 a night - are now reviewing security measures following the prank at 10.30pm last Saturday.

Lydia Smith, director of sales and marketing, said the fish were all unharmed.

She added: 'It was a careless act and dangerous for all involved, including the fish.'

Footage of the incident has been posted on YouTube where it has been viewed more than 10,000 times.

But YouTube users were equally unimpressed after the video was posted online, with one commenting: 'Did you check to see if they had a pool?'

Another web user who came across the 44-second clip wrote: 'Maybe try filling the tank with piranha fish. '
