Scenes of rioting across the country today claimed their first life as a young man shot while he was sitting in a car last night died in hospital.

A murder hunt was under way today after the 26-year-old was killed in the attack in Croydon, south London.

He was discovered seriously injured in the vehicle at about 9.15pm as trouble flared in the south London suburb.

Two other people - believed to be aged in their late 20s - were arrested at the scene for handling stolen goods and taken to a south London police station.

Detectives from Operation Trident have launched an investigation, a spokesman for Scotland Yard said.

The shooting happened in Warrington Road as the south London suburb experienced some of the worst rioting.

Earlier the man's condition had been described as 'serious'.

Tonight a second man, aged in his 60s, was fighting for his life after apparently confronting rioters in Ealing.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'At approx 9.15pm on Monday August 8 police were called to reports of a 26-year 
old man found with gun shot wounds in Warrington Road, Croydon, at the junction 
with Dupass Hill Road.

'The man was inside a car when police found him.'

The nearby Reeves - a well-known 144-year-old furniture store - was completely burnt down last night.

Following the rioting last night David Cameron has promised 16,000 police officers will be on the streets tonight to quell the disorder.

So far 525 people have been arrested in London since the riots started in Tottenham on Saturday. More than 100 people have been charged.

After
 cutting short his Tuscany holiday to deal with the worsening public 
disorder crisis, Mr Cameron said today: 'We will do everything necessary
 to restore order to Britain's streets and to make them safe for the 
law-abiding.

'Let me, first
 of all, completely condemn the scenes that we have seen on our 
television screens and people have witnessed in their communities.

'These
 are sickening scenes - scenes of people looting, vandalising, thieving,
 robbing, scenes of people attacking police officers and even attacking 
fire crews as they're trying to put out fires.

'This is criminality, pure
 and simple, and it has to be confronted and defeated.'
