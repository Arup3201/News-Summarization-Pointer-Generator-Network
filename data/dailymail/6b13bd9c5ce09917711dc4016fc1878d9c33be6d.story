Battle: Jack Blades, 16, is fighting for his life after taking Mortal Kombat pills at a house party

A teenager has been arrested for alleged drugs offences after two boys were taken to hospital having taken 'Mortal Kombat' ecstasy tablets.

A 16-year-old - named locally as Jack Blades - remains in a serious but stable condition in intensive care after taking a pill at a house party in Coatbridge, near Glasgow, on Saturday night.

A 17-year-old who came to the hospital with him was discharged following tests.

It's believed the teenagers swallowed red 'Mortal Kombat' ecstasy tablets at the party - the type linked to the death of 17-year-old Regane MacColl from Clydebank in West Dunbartonshire last month.

Police Scotland said a 16-year-old boy has been arrested and is expected to appear at Airdrie Sheriff Court tomorrow.

Mr Blade and his unidentified friend were admitted to Monklands District General Hospital in Airdrie at about 11.30pm on Saturday evening, a police spokesperson added.

The illegal drugs they had taken included ecstasy and 'possibly' a Mortal Kombat tablet, the spokesperson went on to say.

The distinctive red tablet with a dragon image imprinted on it is an ecstasy-style drug and is thought to have been responsible for the death of Miss MacColl last month.

The 17-year-old died after taking one of the tablets at Glasgow 
nightspot The Arches on February 1.

Warnings issued about the red pills following Miss MacColl's death were renewed yesterday.

Dr Neil Howie, NHS Lanarkshire Consultant in Emergency Medicine, said: 'We cannot stress highly enough that anyone who takes an illicit drug is putting their health, and indeed their life, in jeopardy. Users can never actually be sure of what they are taking and what the contents are.'

'We would urge anyone who has taken an ecstasy tablet, and in particularly Mortal Kombat, who feels unwell to seek urgent medical advice and treatment from their local hospital.'

Tragic: Regane MacColl died after taking mortal kombat in a Glasgow nightclub, The Arches, last month

'Mortal Kombat' tablets are particularly lethal because they contain an active ingredient called PMA.

PMA is five-times stronger than MDMA - ecstasy's typical active ingredient - but takes far longer to kick in, meaning young and inexperienced users will often take extra pills while waiting to feel the effects.

As with all street drugs, Mortal Kombat tablets may also be cut with a whole host of other substances - including dangerous chemicals - so even experienced users can never be 100 per cent sure what they are actually taking.

PMA is sold for as little as £3, and usually comes as red or pink Love Hearts sweet-shaped pills that are stamped with an 'M' or a image of a dragon.

The drug is also occasionally sold as powder.

PMA often has the same street names as ecstasy as it has a similar effect to MDMA.

It has been linked to multiple deaths, in the UK, Canada, Norway and Denmark.

'Early warning signs include a feeling 
of agitation and distress and it is important that people are seen as 
early as possible if they experience any of these symptoms,' Dr Howie went on to say.

Police Scotland's Inspector
 Paul Livingstone added: 'Further to previous warnings, I would again 
strongly advise people to avoid illicit drugs as their exact content is 
unknown and can contain dangerous chemicals. Users must be aware of 
these dangers and understand the devastating effect they can have.'

Currently, the full ingredients of the so-called Mortal Kombat pill remain unknown, but drug experts have warned it may contain 
another substance called PMA, which was blamed for the deaths of more 
than 10 young people within a 60-mile radius of Manchester last year.

PMA is sold in pills costing as little as £3 or in a crystal-like form, are sometimes pink and shaped like Love Hearts sweets, or stamped with an 'M'.

The drug often has the same street names as ecstasy as it has a similar effect to ecstasy's main chemical, MDMA.

But the active ingredient in PMA is five times stronger and takes longer to kick in, meaning many revellers take extra pills.

PMA has been linked to multiple deaths, both in the UK and in Canada, Norway and Denmark.

Detective Inspector Debbie Johnstone, of Coatbridge CID, appealed for anyone with information about the supply of illegal mortal kombat drugs to come forward.
