Action hero Mark Wahlberg isn’t taking any chances. With terror threats heating up worldwide, and today being the 13th anniversary of 9/11, the actor made a last minute decision to cancel plans for him and his entourage to fly from Boston to LA on a commercial flight. 

On September 11th, 2001, the 43-year-old Transformers star was actually booked on the doomed American Airlines Flight 11 that left Boston’s Logan Airport and flew into the North Tower of the World Trade Center killing all 92 passengers on board.

Fate:  Mark Wahlberg made a last-minute decision to cancel plans for him and his entourage to fly from Boston to LA on a commercial flight 

Horror: 'If I was on the plane with my kids, it wouldn't have went down like it did,’ Wahlberg said at the time. ‘There would have been a lot of blood in that first class cabin

But a few days earlier he changed his plans and flew to Toronto when a friend asked him to view his film at the Toronto Film Festival, sparing his life.

At the time Wahlberg was criticized for claiming that, had he been on board, things may have played out much differently. 

‘If I was on the plane with my kids, it wouldn’t have went down like it did,’ he said at the time. ‘There would have been a lot of blood in that first class cabin and then me saying, okay we’re going to land somewhere safely, don’t worry.’ 

He later issued an apology. ‘To speculate about such a situation is ridiculous to begin with, and to suggest I would have done anything differently than the passengers on that plane was irresponsible. I deeply apologize to the families of the victims that my answer came off as offensive; it was certainly not my attention.’ 

Bi-coastal: Wahlberg, his co-stars and his crew have been filming Ted 2 in Boston when the director decided to move the shoot to LA

Wahlberg, his co-stars and his crew have been filming Ted 2 in Boston and although they were scheduled to continue shooting on the East Coast for another month before moving back to LA, director Seth MacFarlane decided to move the shoot back to the West Coast in order to give it a better loo. He even coughed up a whopping $10 million out of his own pocket to make that happen. 

‘Ten million isn’t really that much when you consider the original Ted made close to $300 million,’ says a source. 

‘That’s why Mark is leaving the decision to move in Seth’s hands. But when he found out the studio booked passage for the actors and crew on a commercial jet on 9/11, traveling that same route – Boston to LA - he decided to rent a private jet to help insure the group’s safety. 

‘Mark has never really gotten over the fact that if he hadn’t made the last minute decision to fly to Toronto, he would have been on board that doomed flight,’ says the source. ‘And he just wasn’t willing to take any chances on 9/11 of anything happening when he’s already cheated death once.’
