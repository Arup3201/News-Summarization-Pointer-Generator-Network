A landlord spent nearly a year trying to evict his tenants - and this was the appalling mess they left behind.

A mother and her four children had lived in the house owned by Jagjit Singh in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, for two years but she had not paid the £550-a-month rent since last May.

The family finally moved out of the property after a lengthy eviction battle but Mr Singh, 53, was horrified to find piles of bin bags, litter and dirt after he regained access to the house.

Jagjit Singh discovered piles of rubbish and broken beds when he finally evicted his tenants after a year of trying

The tenants, a mother and three children, had not cleaned up before they moved out of Mr Singh's house in the Horninglow area of Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire

The beds in the house were broken and he says he found piles of pizza boxes and food up to 2ft-high in the bedrooms, while the bathroom he installed before the family moved in had been left dirty with the toilet not flushed.

Mr Singh claims the fight to get his tenants out of his house in the Horninglow area of the town has cost him more than £5,000 in missed rent payments and £650 in solicitor's fees, and he says he will need to spend about £2,000 to clean it up and make repairs.

He says the family, with children aged from about 10 to 17 years old, had their rent paid by housing benefit, which is usually paid directly to landlords.

He said a court had ordered the tenant to pay back the missed payments, but his solicitor advised him he had no chance of seeing his money again.

Mr Singh said: 'It has been left absolutely ruined. There has been a lot of damage done.

The mess also took over the garden with piles of discarded bin bags and litter

Mr Singh says he has given up hope of ever trying to recover the thousands of pounds he claims to have lost in the fight to evict his tenants

'The lady stopped paying rent last year, 
and I've been trying to get her out ever since. I had to go to court to 
get an eviction notice.'

He also said he had given up any hope of recouping any of the money lost.

Mr Singh said: 'I'll have to pay to clean it. It will be coming out of my pocket. I won't be getting any money back. I've lost that money.

'I can't understand how someone could live like that. I've never seen a house like it.'

Nobody from East Staffordshire Borough Council was available to comment today.
