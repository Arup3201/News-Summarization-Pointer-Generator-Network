French World Cup winner Patrick Vieira has suggested that England's difficulties stem from 'a lack of pure talent' currently at the disposal of manager Roy Hodgson.   

The Three Lions slumped to the country's worst performance at a World Cup in 56 years, exiting at the group stages after failing to win against any of Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica.

Vieira has identified a dearth of top quality players and the need to address issues at grassroots level as the primary reasons behind England's struggles.

Speaking at a press conference in the Croatian coastal town of Novigrad, where Vieira is managing the Manchester City Elite Development Squad at their pre-season training camp, the Frenchman said: 'I think for all the people who love England and love English football like I do, it was very disappointing. 

'They have to learn from the mistakes and improve the talent. The problem is more in the grassroots than in the club teams.  

Asked to divulge further on the mistakes that England have made, Vieira replied: 'It's hard to analyse that. From the outside, I think it's maybe a lack of pure talent.'   

Vieira was, however, more impressed by the performance of his native France, who reached the quarter-finals in Brazil and demonstrated a vast improvement from an acrimonious campaign at the World Cup in South Africa in 2010: 'I was very proud of the team. I think we play some good football but we need to more mature.   

'I think the progression from 2010 to 2014 has been fantastic and I think that Didier Deschamps has done a very good job.'
