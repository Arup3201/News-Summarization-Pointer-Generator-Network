Official Liverpool sponsor Dunkin Donuts has apologised after sharing an edited version of the club's badge.

The company angered a number of fans after tweeting an alternative Liverpool crest which featured donuts, coffee and the Dunkin Donuts logo.

The famous Shankly gates which adorn the top of the Liverpool badge were changed to images of donuts, 'You'll Never Walk Alone' was altered to the slogan 'America runs on Dunkin'' while the Hillsborough eternal flame was replaced with coffee cups.
