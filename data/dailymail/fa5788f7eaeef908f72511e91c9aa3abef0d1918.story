Beloved family pet Mercedes was savaged by two hunting dogs before being tossed into her owners' wheelie bin

When Neil Watton and Angela Ball received a call on holiday from daughter Beth saying their beloved cat Mercedes was missing they raced home early to join the search.

Distraught Beth, 18, had popped round to feed the family's two identical cats when she noticed blood stains splattered over the drive and realised Mercedes was nowhere to be seen.

Desperate to find the five-year-old tabby, Mr Watton, 47, began scouring CCTV footage captured on three cameras mounted at the front of the house. It was then that he discovered his pet's grisly fate.

The recording showed Mercedes being 
brutally savaged by two large dogs - believed to be lurchers - until a
man appears to shoo them away.

The man then picks up the body of their dead pet before callously dumping her into the family's own wheelie bin. 

Mr Watton, from Belgrave, Tamworth, said: 'I couldn’t believe what I 
was seeing. Mercedes was so close to the front of the house but she 
stood no chance really up against hunting dogs.

'But to just toss her in the bin, 
that’s the part we cannot get over. Surely this person knew it was a pet
cat and somebody would be wondering where she was in the morning.'

Ms Ball, 44,  hasn’t viewed the footage 
due to its distressing nature.

She said: 'We’d had Mercedes for five and a 
half years, she was part of the family.

'The dogs are doing what is natural to
them but they should be on leads. It’s just the cold hearted way he put
her in the bin and then walked off.

'I’d like him to face the music about this, or at least apologise to us.'

'We are looking into the incident and working with our partners to see if anything can be done.'
