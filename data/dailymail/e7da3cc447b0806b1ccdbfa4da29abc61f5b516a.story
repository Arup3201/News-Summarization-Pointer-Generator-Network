Manchester United have always believed in nourishing young talent at the club, and it appears current boss Louis van Gaal is keen to stick to those principles.

The Dutchman was in attendance as the Red Devils' Under 18s contingent took on Hull in the FA Youth Cup fourth round at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.

And Van Gaal, who has promoted youngsters such as Paddy McNair, James Wilson and Tyler Blackett into the first-team this season; would have been a happy spectator as United came out on top 3-0 against the Tigers.

After goalless first half, the hosts took the lead through Zach Dearnley on 59 minutes when his deflected cross looped in over Hull goalkeeper Joseph Walker and into the net.

Four minutes later, United doubled their lead when Callum Gribbin scored a free-kick after being fouled on the edge of the box.

The same player made it 3-0 soon after as he showed great poise and quick feet inside the area before lashing home a low drive for his second of the night.

Paul McGuinness' side also hit the frame of the Hull goal on three separate occasions in front of a crowd of 4,087 people - which included Van Gaal.

The young Reds will face an away fifth-round encounter at either Tottenham or Wolves.
