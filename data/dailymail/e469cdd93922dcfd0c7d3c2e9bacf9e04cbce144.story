Louis van Gaal and his Manchester United players took in the sights of Santa Monica beach as they arrived in Los Angeles for their pre-season tour.

The Dutchman and his 25-strong touring party touched down at LA International airport on Friday night and then headed straight for the beach.

United's players looked relaxed in full club suits as they leisurely strolled down by the sea front. They then headed to
 the Beverly Hills hotel where they will spend the next six nights.

United play LA Galaxy on 
Wednesday before heading to Denver, Washington DC and Detroit during 
their pre-season tour.

Ryan Giggs, Darren Fletcher and Juan Mata all signed autographs for some of the 100-plus fans who had gathered to greet them.

Van Gaal and his squad will train at the Stubhub Center, home of the Galaxy, on Saturday.

Youth-team
 products Sam Johnstone, Tyler Blackett, Michael Keane, Reece James, 
Jesse Lingard and Will Keane are part of the touring party, but there 
was no room for James Wilson and Tom Lawrence, who made their first-term
 debuts at the end of last season.

United
 had announced earlier this month that stars such as Wayne Rooney, David de
 Gea and Mata would travel to the US along with new signings Luke Shaw 
and Ander Herrera.

Robin van Persie, Javier Hernandez, Marouane Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj are still on holiday after the World Cup.

Michael
 Carrick is a notable absentee after undergoing ankle surgery on 
Thursday morning that could rule him out for the first two months of the
 season.

In
 his first press conference on Thursday, Van Gaal said he would spend 
the next three or four weeks assessing the players he has at his 
disposal before deciding on potential new signings and departures.

The Red 
Devils will play four matches in the US beginning with David Beckham's 
former club.
