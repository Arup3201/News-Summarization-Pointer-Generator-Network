While the true meaning of Christmas is often lost among the festivities, you’d expect a government tree to bear some relevance to the occasion.

But no ornament can be seen with the word ‘Christmas’, ‘Jesus’, his picture or a nativity scene on the 63ft Sierra White Fir outside the U.S. Capitol.

However what is easy for people to view standing near the tree's base in Washington D.C. is an ornament with the phrase: ‘I love President Obama’.

The Architect of the Capitol is responsible for the tree and told Cybercast News Service there is no policy or restrictions on themes or ornaments.

But it could not confirm whether there are any ornaments about Christmas or Christ - or any other elected officials in addition to Barack Obama.

Congress has decorated a Christmas tree outside the Capitol every year since 1964 and it has been cut down from a National Forest since 1968.

States including West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, California and Vermont have all sent the tree - and the state is responsible for the theme.

This year’s tree came from the Stanislaus National Forest in Tuolumne County, California, reported Cybercast News Service.

Its theme was ‘California Shores’ and state residents submitted ornaments to show ‘the rich cultural and ecological diversity of this state’.

The tree has one ornament referencing Psalm 19 with the words ‘More precious than Gold’, but this does not directly reference Christmas.

Other ornaments include tributes to Disneyland, Hollywood and the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, reported Cybercast News Service.

Furthermore the tree has a number of ornaments which reportedly look like Christmas gifts - but these all have ‘Happy Holidays’ written on them.
