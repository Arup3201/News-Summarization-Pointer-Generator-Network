Hoboken mayor Dawn Zimmer has handed the U.S. Attorney's Office her journal and other documents she claims prove Chris Christie threatened to withhold Sandy aid to her unless she supported one of his development projects.

Zimmer released a statement Sunday night revealing she spent 'hours' with lawyers discussing the latest controversy to hit the New Jersey governor.

'As they pursue this investigation, I will provide any requested information and testify under oath about the facts of what happened when the Lieutenant Governor came to Hoboken and told me that Sandy aid would be contingent on moving forward with a private development project,' she said in the statement.

Cut off: Hoboken mayor Dawn Zimmer claims Sandy relief money was withheld to try to force her to approve a lucrative redevelopment deal

Earlier, she told CNN that it was 
'stunning' and 'outrageous,' but true, that Lieutenant Governor Kim 
Guadagno approached her in a parking lot in May to deliver the threat, 
stating that it was 'a direct message from the Governor.'

'I stand by my word,' she told CNN's Candy Crowley.

Democratic
 New Jersey Assemblyman John Wisniewski says he will expand an existing 
investigation into Zimmer's allegations. He's already investigating 
traffic jams at the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey, 
allegedly orchestrated by Christie aides as political payback.

The
 damning accusations, which Christie's administration vehemently denies,
 came as the Governor left his 'bridge-gate' troubles behind and flew to
 Florida to campaign for a fellow Republican. 

Zimmer
 alleged that Guadagno and another aide, community affairs commissioner 
Richard Constable, leaned on her to gain support for the lucrative deal.

'The bottom line is, it's not fair for 
the governor to hold Sandy funds hostage for the City of Hoboken because
 he wants me to give back to one private developer,' she told MSNBC.

Sandy devastated nearly 80 per cent of the Hoboken community in 2012, and Christie had immediately promised its residents that he would 'be here to help'.

But when Zimmer requested $127 million in relief aid, she was given just $142,000 to cover the cost of a back up generator, and $200,000 in recovery grants from a $1.8 million fund, MSNBC reported.

In a letter written to Christie about the low funds, Zimmer wrote: 'Please 
governor, we need 
your help. I have tried to assure Hoboken residents that we would be 
treated fairly.'

No response has been received from the letter, which was dated May 8, 2013 - the same day the city's planning board rejected a redevelopment recommendation for The Rockefeller Group.

According to emails, public records and her diary entries, Zimmer claims Christie's aides were willing to cut off constituents and use public funds to finance a study for the governor-backed plans.

The project, a mass redevelopment proposed by the Rockefeller Group, was already in the pipeline when Zimmer was elected as mayor.

The lucrative deal in a popular commuter area would have given the developers a free rein to build what they wanted while applying for millions of dollars in subsidies.

Zimmer told MSNBC she wasn't against the plan, but she did want an independent study on the projected deal to take place.

But when the study and Hoboken board rejected the need for redevelopment, much-needed Sandy relief money was cut off, Zimmer claims.

According to a diary entry from the mayor, Guadagno pulled her aside during an event in Hoboken on May 13, last year.

The diary entry read: 'She pulls me aside with 
no one else around and says that I need to move forward with the 
Rockefeller project. It is very important to the governor.

'"The word is 
that you are against it and you need to move forward or we are not going
 to be able to help you. I know it's not right – these things should not
 be connected – but they are," she says, and "if you tell anyone, I will 
deny it."'

Then, in a diary entry for May 17, Zimmer claimed as she was preparing to appear on a televised panel about the Sandy recovery, Commissioner Constable leaned in and told her 'Everyone in the State House believes you are against [the Rockefeller project].'

Zimmer denied she was against it, but Commissioner Constable then allegedly told her: 'If you move that forward, the money would start flowing to 
you.'

Claims: Chris Christie with Community Affairs Commissioner Richard Constable, who allegedly leaned on Dawn Zimmer to support a project in return for more Sandy aid

'Pressure': Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno allegedly told Mayor Zimmer if she didn't move forward with the project, the administration would not be able to help her

Spokesmen for Governor Christie and community affairs commissioner Constable have denied the allegations.

A spokeswoman for the commissioner said: 'Mayor Zimmer's 
allegation that on May 16, 2013, Commissioner Constable conditioned 
Hoboken's receipt of Sandy aid on her moving forward with a development 
project is categorically false.'

The Governor's spokesman, Michael Drewniak, released a statement that read: 'Mayor Zimmer has been effusive in her public praise of the Governor's Office and the assistance we've provided in terms of economic development and Sandy aid.'

'What or who is driving her only now to say such outlandishly false things is anyone's guess.'

A spokesman for the Rockefellar Group said: 'We 
have no knowledge of any information pertaining to this allegation. If 
it turns out to be true it would be deplorable.'

Despite the 'bridge-gate' scandal, many Republicans have come to Governor Christie's defense and praised him for taking action.

Others have said the future of the man who had been tipped to be a presidential contender rests on whether his account of when he learned of the bridge scandal is found to be accurate.
