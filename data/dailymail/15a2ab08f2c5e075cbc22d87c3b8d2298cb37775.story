Rev Rob Morris gave his 'unreserved apology' for appearing to participate in joint worship

A Connecticut Lutheran pastor has 
apologised for participating in an interfaith prayer vigil for Sandy Hook victims 
because his church prohibits its clergy from worshipping with other faiths.

Rev Rob Morris of Christ the King Lutheran Church  gave the benediction at a prayer vigil attended by leaders from Christian, Muslim and Jewish 
faiths, as well as by
President Barack Obama and relatives of the 20 first graders who were killed.

Morris requested an announcement before 
the event explaining that participating clergy were not endorsing each other's 
views.

But in a statement posted February 1, the Missouri Synod president, the Rev Matthew 
Harrison, said Morris's 'specific and commendable' steps to avoid 
violating the church's constitution remained insufficient.

He
said the event constituted joint worship since other clergy wore their 
vestments and the vigil included prayers and religious readings.

Rev Harrison wrote: 'There is sometimes a
real tension between wanting to bear witness to Christ and at the same 
time avoiding situations which may give the impression that our 
differences with respect to who God is, who Jesus is, how he deals with 
us and how we get to heaven, really don't matter in the end.

Morris does not believe he engaged in joint worship, but has apologised.

In his own statement, Morris underscored the steps he took to avoid any appearance he was supporting other doctrines.

US President Barack Obama spoke before Rev Rob Morris at the memorial service for the victims and relatives of the Sandy Hook shooting

'To those who believe that I have 
endorsed false teaching, I assure you that was not my intent, and I give
you my unreserved apologies,' he wrote.

'I did not believe my participation 
to be an act of joint worship, but one of mercy and care to a community 
shocked and grieving an unspeakably horrific event. However, I recognize
others in our church consider it to constitute joint worship and I 
understand why.'

'I accept his apology,' Harrison wrote, and made what he called an earnest request that no one file a complaint against Morris under the denomination's disciplinary system.

Harrison declined to comment further, but Vicki Biggs, a spokeswoman for the denomination, told Associated Press: 'We are proud of the work Pastor Morris has done in Newtown and how he has served the community in so many ways.'

The denomination has been struggling for
years with this rule, which is currently under a broad review. The 
church constitution requires congregants to renounce 'unionism and 
syncretism of every description.'

A Missouri Synod pastor, the Rev David Benke, was suspended for a time after participating in a Yankee Stadium interfaith service soon after the September 11 attacks that was held in Yankee Stadium.

About two dozen pastors and a few congregations had complained about Benke's involvement.

The 2.3 million-member Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, based in the St. Louis area, is separate from the larger, liberal Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, based in Chicago.
