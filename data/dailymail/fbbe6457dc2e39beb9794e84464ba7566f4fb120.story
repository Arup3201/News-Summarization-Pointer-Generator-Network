High street winner: Miss Berry in the bomber jacket fans loved

She has already amassed a multi-million-pound fortune thanks to her bakeware and cookbook empire.

Now Mary Berry wants to launch a fashion range for older women because she dislikes modern trends such as low-cut tops, which can reveal skin that is ‘all wrinkled down there’, and ‘dreadful’ jegging trousers.

The Great British Bake Off star, 79, has attracted as many headlines for her style credentials as she has for her cake-making skills.

Giving an interview in which she revealed her plans, Miss Berry said: ‘I’ve been thinking about that and I’d like to do a range for somebody like Jaeger or MaxMara. I would do good, stylish cuts in durable fabrics that hem well and don’t crease – that’s why I never wear linen, because I like things to look pristine.’

Miss Berry criticised modern fashions such as micro-shorts, saying: ‘They’re dreadful. Dreadful! And I think jeggings and leggings are no good on most women, either – certainly not older women. Obviously women can do what they like, but I wouldn’t dream of wearing them.’

Miss Berry made headlines for her fashion choices after wearing a series of high street blazers on Bake Off.

It started in 2012 with a floral bomber jacket, which cost £29.99 at Zara. Hundreds of Twitter users demanded to know where she bought it. And since then sales of designs she has worn have soared, some high street brands have reported.

But despite being an apparent trendsetter, Miss Berry said she struggles to find clothes she likes because few retailers cater for her age group. Speaking to Glamour magazine, she said: ‘Well, I hope that I dress for my age. Because there’s no need to be dowdy, is there?

‘But most things are totally unsuitable for somebody of 79. You have to really hunt at my age because an arm is not beautiful at this stage. Also a fairly high neck is a good thing.’

She added of low-cut tops: ‘I don’t like to see it all wrinkled down there … but if you’ve got a good bra, then it’s OK.’

Miss Berry, who lives with her husband Paul Hunnings in a £2million house in Buckinghamshire, earns an estimated £200,000 annual salary for appearing on BBC1’s Bake Off, plus a further sum for presenting her solo show Mary Berry Cooks on BBC2.

In the past eight years she is believed to have made £2.3million from sales of her cookbooks, while last year her sauces and chutneys earned her £1.2million. She reportedly has five-figure kitchenware deals with Lakeland and Sainsbury’s.

The October edition of Glamour magazine is out on Monday.
