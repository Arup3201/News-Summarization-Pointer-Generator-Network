Joey Barton has branded Mario Balotelli 'the biggest myth in world football' after the Liverpool's striker's display in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday.

The Italian firebrand replaced Rickie Lambert in the third round clash against Middlesbrough but failed to make an impact before scoring a pair of penalties in the Reds' epic 14-13 shootout victory.

Barton went on Twitter to comment on the game with a scathing attack on the 24-year-old, although he did concede that Balotelli could not be faulted for his prowess from the spot.

The QPR midfielder claims Balotelli is no substitute for the departed Luis Suarez

The QPR midfielder and part-time philosopher tweeted: 'Balotelli? He is the biggest myth in World football the fella. Fair play to him he's had everyones trolleys down...

'People now realising just how good Luis Suarez was. I mean how do you replace that quality? Certainly not with MB. He does take a mean peno!' 

There is no love lost between the pair of Premier League pantomime villains, who clashed during the final game of the 2011-12 season when Balotelli won the league with Manchester City.

On that occasion, Barton was sent off for violent conduct and subsequently received a 12-match ban and £75,000 fine.

Balotelli has scored one goal since his £16million move from AC Milan in the summer but will have more opportunities to impress with Liverpool's leading striker Daniel Sturridge currently sidelined with a thigh injury.
