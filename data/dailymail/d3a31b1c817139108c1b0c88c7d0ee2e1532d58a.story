Zinedine Zidane will take his first step toward first-team management, after being appointed as manager of Real Madrid's reserve squad, Castilla.

Zidane had been Carlo Ancelotti's first squad assistant coach this season, as Real won 'la decima' - their tenth European title.

The World Cup winning midfielder is 
thought to be keen on going into management, and was linked to French 
club Bordeaux this summer.
