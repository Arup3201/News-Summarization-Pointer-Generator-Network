A loving couple who died after apparently being poisoned by their coal fire were found dead in each other's arms on their sofa.

Pamela and Leslie Cox were discovered lifeless in front of the television in the front room of their home in Wickford, Essex, by their sons.

It is believed that the popular couple, who had been married for 36 years, were poisoned after their coal fire developed a fault, causing smoke to gradually pour into their house.

An ambulance service spokeswoman confirmed a hazardous area response team was deployed as it was thought carbon monoxide may be involved.

Their devastated sons, Ian, 32 and Neil, 33, revealed today that thermal heating engineer Mr Cox had been rushed by ambulance to Basildon Hospital on Friday after feeling unwell yet was diagnosed with an ear infection.

And whilst at the hospital Mrs Cox passed out but doctors allegedly said she just suffering from shock and sent the couple home.

Police have launched an investigation but confirmed today that the deaths are not being treated as suspicious.

Neil Cox fought back tears as he described what he and his brother were confronted with as they entered their parents terraced house yesterday morning.

The thermal heating engineer said: 'We couldn't get hold of mum and dad, so we both came round and found them cuddled up together on the couch.

'The pair of them sitting there, happy together - it's as though they fell asleep together.

'There was such a strong smell when we opened the door, we just knew as we entered the property that there was something wrong.

'It was some sort of poisoning - an ambulance took my dad to hospital on Friday evening and then mum collapsed in the hospital but all they did was check her blood pressure and said "you are fine"  and said to dad he had an ear infection and sent them home.

'Obviously Basildon Hospital is not doing its job properly are they? I am sorry but for two people to be in at the same time like that and then be sent home, there is something wrong.

'Something has been missed - if they had checked them properly, then they would still be here now.

'They said they felt like they had a hangover even though they had not been drinking.'

And his brother, Ian, is appealing for people to check their appliances to prevent further tragedies happening:

'I just want everyone to be careful, to have alarms because it is such a tragedy that we have lost our mum and dad.'

The sons said their popular parents had been planning their retirement and loved spending time at their caravan at Clacton.

Ian added: 'We will remember them as smiling and with a drink in their hand - that's how they were in life and they left it smiling.

'They have left behind three grandchildren, it's just a tragedy. They were the best two people in the world.

'Mum would do anything for anyone, she was that sort of person and dad was a "happy go lucky" guy - he was our football manager when we were lads.

'Mum was always putting others before themselves, they were just enjoying life and looking forward to retiring to Clacton.

'We are taking strength from the fact that they were together and that it was peaceful.

'The television was on, the lights were on - it was as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.'

Essex Police this morning confirmed that they are treating the deaths as 'unexplained' at this stage.

A spokesman said: 'The deaths are not being treated as suspicious but the home is being preserved for a detailed examination to try to establish the circumstances surrounding the deaths.'

A police community support officer remains outside the £200,000 terraced house which has been taped off as investigations continue.

Post mortems into the deaths are set to take place later this week.
