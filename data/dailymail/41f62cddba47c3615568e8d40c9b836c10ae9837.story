A grandfather from Louisville, Kentucky is in the best shape he's ever been in his life - but just a few years ago he was overweight and couldn't walk without a cane.

Fitness group BarStarzz introduced Robert, 64, to the world on its YouTube channel.

The buff senior says he only began exercising when he was 56 years old and was introduced to his latest fitness obsession, calisthenics, less than two years ago.

Waving the flag: Robert says everyone can get fit if they devote an hour or two to exercise every day

'I discovered calisthenics watching BarStarzz on YouTube about a year and a half ago and I decided I would give it a whirl and fell in love with it,' he says.

In the video, Robert performs exercises a man half his age would have difficulty with, such as the 'flag', where he holds himself horizontally from a pole.

'Stuff people says I can't do, I'm proving them wrong, that I can do this stuff,' he says.

Robert explains how in his mid-fifties, he was badly out of shape.

Better than ever: Now, the grandfather feels healthier and happier than ever

'At 56 years old, I was overweight, couldn't really walk, had braces and was walking on canes and walkers. I wasn't really happy with my life and the way things was going,' he says.

He couldn't keep up with his children or grandchildren and he wasn't in good health.

After watching fitness videos on YouTube, Robert decided to go to the gym.

He was undeterred by people who questioned his abilities because of his age and now, he's fitter and stronger than he's ever been before.

'I feel better now than I did when I was 18 years old,' he says.

'My advice to other people is to take an hour or two a day and get started on the calisthenics, cardio, weight-lifting - whatever you can do. It pays off in the long run, you feel a lot better.'
