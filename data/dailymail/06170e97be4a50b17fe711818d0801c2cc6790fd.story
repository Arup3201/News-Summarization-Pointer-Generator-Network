Rumour after rumour was swirling and stoking the hopes and frustrations of the crowd - there would be gas in two hours, in five hours, in six hours. But once it gets here the question is how long will it last?

Last night people were fighting over the dwindling fuel left, but by this morning that desperation had turned into simply finding it - or even the promise of it.

At Ozone Park, Queens, New York that ripple of a rumour that a truck was on its way was all that it took. And after two hours of driving past closed gas stations patrolled by police waving angry drivers by it is easy to understand why.

Patience: People wait in line for fuel at a Shell Oil station in Fort Lee, New Jersey

By 7.30am the cars were lined up around two blocks. By 10.30am there were more than 100, engines stilled, drivers out, waiting. On the forecourt 50 people were huddled holding their gas cans, water bottles, as many containers they could carry or load onto a trolley.

They want fuel and they want answers.

For Tiffany Adams a worker for New York City Transport it was the second day of searching and waiting - and she was not alone: 'I drove all down Atlantic Avenue yesterday and every gas station was closed. I've got two kids, a four-year-old and a seven year old. We've got no power, CONED is doing nothing, telling us nothing.'

Out of gas: A police officer moves a car that is out of gas, trying to position it so it can fill up, at a gas station in Brooklyn today

Heated: Tempers flared at the Gulf station at Flatbush Avenue and Kings Highway, as customers suspected the gas station attendant was pumping gas for a man that cut in line

Desperate: Last night people were fighting over the dwindling fuel left, but by this morning that desperation had turned into simply finding it - or even the promise of it

Her anger was echoed by others standing by. 'It's all about Manhattan,' said one. 'The mayor's doing a horrible job,' came another and within moments the anger that lies so close to the surface right now bubbled up.

People tweeted 
asking for information on open gas stations, others tweeted when they 
found them or moment by moment as they closed. A Facebook site was set 
up to track what was open, what was closed, when gas was perhaps being 
delivered, how long the queue to get it.

Earl Lucas, 72, had seen something like it before, in the seventies he said when there was, as he put it, 'a real gas shortage.'

'People are angry because the gas is there they just can't get it. Do you know how to get it? Can you use your influence to get some?

Wait in line: Queues of people and of cars snake around the block waiting for fuel in this gas station in Newark, N.J.

Call for order: A New York City Police officer speaks to a customer at a Hess fuelling station in Brooklyn, New York Harbor as the fuel crisis grips the New York area

'There were five trucks came in here from a Catholic charity and they got straight through and filled up. Some people can get it.'

This is how it starts - the rumours of special treatment, apocryphal or true no-one in this queue really knows but they feed the resentment and frustration offering someone or some group to blame.

However united these people may be in a common need the reality is that if that need can't be met for all, camaraderie will swiftly give way to something altogether more ugly. It already has elsewhere. The police know it, that's why they are here and the crowd know it - they can feel it.

'People are getting killed for gas,' shouted one guy.
