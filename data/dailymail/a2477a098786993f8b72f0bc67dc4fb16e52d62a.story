An Idaho woman has pleaded guilty to allegations that she had two of her children help her burn her 2-year-old daughter's body in a barrel after the toddler died of a head injury.

Court records say Veronica Herrera of Homedale told investigators she 'freaked out' after her daughter Nakita jumped off a potty chair, hit her head on a heater and died hours later last August.

The 29-year-old told police she put the toddler in a playpen after her injury and asked her 9-year-old son to watch her while she took some of her other children to her sister's home in Caldwell, according to documents.

Mother: Veronica Herrera of Homedale, Idaho told police she was helped by two of her children in burning her 2-year-old daughter's body after she hit her head on a heater and died

Fatal accident: Herrera said that Nakita, pictured,  jumped off a potty chair and hit her head before putting her down to rest and finding her unresponsive several hours later

Burned: Herrera told police she was worried she'd lose custody of her other children so put the toddler's body in a barrel and lit it on fire with the help of two of her other children

Herrera told police she later called her son and asked how Nakita was doing and he said she was sleeping.

When she came home later that night, she told investigators she noticed a large bump on Nakita's head and realized the child wasn't breathing.

Herrera says she burned the body out of fear of losing custody of her children.

Prosecutors said Herrera told police that she put the toddler's body in the back of her van that night, and that the next morning she walked to the store to buy lighter fluid, put the body in the barrel and set it on fire.

She told police that she had her other 
children put garbage in the barrel to keep the fire burning, but the 
remains were still recognizable by the next morning so she bought more 
lighter fluid, according to the court records.

She told police she didn't think any of 
her children realized their sister was in the barrel but added that her 
9-year-old 'is a smart kid and might have known,' according to the Idaho Statesman reports.

Hysterical: Officers say Herrera, seen earlier in court, was hysterical as she admitted to her crime to police after confessing to her parents who urged her to report what she had done

Herrera made the statements to police after she told her parents about the death and they drove her to the police station.

The officer who met her described her as hysterical and crying that 'God will never forgive her.'

She admitted something bad had happened to her daughter and that she had made it worse.

Herrera initially was charged with first-degree murder, but pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter on April 11.

She pleaded guilty to failure to report a death, destroying evidence and three counts of injury to a child.

Owyhee County Prosecutor Doug Emery says two injury charges relate to Herrera having two of her children help burn the body.

Herrera is scheduled to be sentenced on July 25.

Emery is seeking 15 to 40 years in prison for her.
