A fraudster who used a Muslim veil to conceal her face on the way to and from court has had her identity revealed by the police.

Shaheda Lorgat, 49, stole £21,000 from a college where she worked. Although she revealed her face in court, she kept it hidden from Press photographers under a niqab.

But after she was jailed for 12 months, Lancashire Police released Lorgat’s mugshot, with her  features clearly visible.

Police sources last night revealed a rising trend among Muslim women for wearing the full veil outside court to escape scrutiny.

Neighbours of Lorgat said she rarely wore a niqab in public and pictures on her Facebook page show her without a veil.

The case comes at a time of increased public debate over Muslim 
head-dress, following the  decision by a college in Birmingham to scrap a
 ban on veils amid protests from students.

Theft: Lorgat (pictured), of Blackburn, Lancashire, had stolen thousands of pounds of money earmarked for college equipment at Blackburn College over an almost-four year period to fund a 'lavish lifestyle'

Sentencing: After she was jailed for a year at Preston Crown Court (file picture), police issued her mugshot without her face covering - and insisted that frauds like the crimes she committed would 'not be tolerated'

Only this week a Muslim woman accused of witness intimidation was ordered by a judge to take off her veil when giving evidence.

Landmark ruling: Separately, Judge Peter Murphy said on Monday that a Muslim woman must remove her full-face veil while giving evidence in court

He told her it was ‘crucial’ that the jury could see her facial 
expressions during testimony and cross-examination, but agreed her 
identity should be screened from the rest of the court.

Preston Crown Court was told that Lorgat, who worked as a  purchasing 
officer at Blackburn College, used a college credit card to steal money 
earmarked for  student equipment in a systematic fraud lasting almost 
four years.

She spent the cash on a holiday to Florida, a trip to Alton 
Towers, solicitors’ bills for her divorce and home improvements.

The thefts were uncovered in February last year when another member of 
staff noticed discrepancies on the credit card bills. Bosses launched an
 internal audit and Lorgat was suspended.

Among the personal items  Lorgat paid for on the college account were 
£9,031 worth of travel costs, solicitors’ bills totalling £2,464 and 
£8,473 on tradesmen.

Lorgat, who claimed she started using the credit 
card following the breakdown of her 20-year marriage, voluntarily 
removed the niqab before entering the dock.

She pleaded guilty to 19 counts of fraud by abuse of position and has since been sacked.

Lorgat’s neighbour Hawa Hamid said: ‘I’m just very shocked.

'When I’ve 
seen her in the neighbourhood she’s only been wearing a head scarf.

‘I 
don’t think I’ve seen her wear a veil so I don’t know why she would wear
 one outside court. 

'Presumably she did not want anyone to recognise 
her.’

Opinion: Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured last week) said the Government should not tell women what to wear, amid ongoing debate over the use of full-face veils

Release: Police officers at Lancashire Constabulary (headquarters pictured) issued Lorgat's mugshot without her face covering - and insisted that frauds like the crimes she committed would 'not be tolerated'

A senior source with Greater Manchester Police told the Mail yesterday: 
‘The ignominy of appearing in the dock at court accused of a crime has 
led to some women deciding to wear a veil to and from court to escape 
the glare of the public eye.’

The source added: ‘On appearance in the dock they have been asked to 
remove the veil to address either the magistrates or judge and have 
willingly done so.'

BORIS Johnson yesterday said it was ‘totally wrong’ for Muslim schools to force pupils as young as 11 to wear veils and burkas.

The Mayor of London said they should not be compulsory, adding: ‘I don’t think it can be classed as any kind of uniform.’

‘That is against my principles and it’s against the principles of liberty that London should stand for.’

A row broke out after it was claimed that some independent secondary schools order girls to wear burkas outside school and headscarves in class.

Two London schools, the £3,000-a-year Ayesha Siddiqa Girls School in Southall and the £1,900-a-year Madani Girls School in Whitechapel, were both said to enforce strict Muslim uniform policies.

But teachers at Madani last night said the rules had been misinterpreted and that pupils were not forced to wear full-face veils.
