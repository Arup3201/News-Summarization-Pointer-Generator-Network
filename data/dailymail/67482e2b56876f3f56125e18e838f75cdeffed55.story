We have all experienced that disappointing moment a supermarket fails to stock our favourite food.

But few will have expressed their frustration in such a novel way as two students from St Andrews University. 

When classics student Isabelle Bousquette and Tomi Baikie, a maths and physics student, found no Butterkist salted caramel popcorn in the town's Tesco branch they decided to write a sonnet to the supermarket giant. 

The St Andrews students first wrote to Tesco and the supermarket giant replied with a poem of their own 

They elected to put pen to paper after their film night was ruined by the lack of popcorn. 

Mr Baikie said: 'It wasn't quite the same watching the movie without the popcorn, so instead of watching the movie we sent this poem to Sir Richard. 

'The hardest, and most time-consuming part was to get the printer to print on the ivory parchment paper we were using.'  

The sonnet included lines such as: 'When I went to the shelf popcorn sits on.

'And just found the lump in my throat you get/When something you love is there, then it's gone.'  

'I live in St Andrews, thus the issue: "No plans to restock," you said with a sigh.

'So answer this, or hand me a tissue: Have I butterkist my true love goodbye?' 

The letter was written to Sir Richard Broadbent, who resigned as chairman of Tesco last month following reports of accounting errors and falling sales due to competition from budget stores Lidl and Aldi.

Despite Sir Richard's departure, the students still received a reply from the Chairman's Office of the supermarket - also written as a poem.

The quick-witted reply from Tesco - which incorrectly referred to Mr Baikie as a 'lady' - urges the pair to 'please dry your tears' as 'we'll still sell your popcorn for many more years'. 

It continues: 'Your favourite popcorn is waiting for you/Across the Tay River, no really it's true!

'Our product is stocked in both Perth and Dundee/And I've found a way you can have it for free.' 

The reply ends by assuring the two students they will be sent a £10 giftcard for their troubles. 

The pair uploaded the poems to the 'overheard at St Andrews' Facebook page and it has attracted almost 3,000 'likes' in three days.
