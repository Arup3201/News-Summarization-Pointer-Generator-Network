Starbucks is dipping its toe into the burger business, with plans to open an outpost of its La Boulange chain that caters to the dinner crowd.

A spokeswoman for Starbucks, Linda Mills, said the Los Angeles restaurant is scheduled to open on June 12 and will be open until 10 p.m. It will also serve beer, wine, cocktails and milkshakes.

Starbucks Corp. had purchased the La Boulange chain of bakery-cafes in 2012. The cafes are based in San Francisco Bay Area and primarily focus on breakfast and lunch with soups, salads and sandwiches, along with baked goods. Those cafes typically close before 7 p.m.

La Boulange will open in Los Angeles on June 12 and will stay open until 10 p.m. serving items such as croissant burgers along with beer and wine

The 
location in Los Angeles will be the first outside of the San Francisco 
area and will have more of a 'modern farmhouse' feel to it, Mills said. 
Many of the bakery items will be the same, but the menu will be 
significantly expanded to include build-your-own-burgers and other 
dishes designed for dinner.

It's just Starbucks' latest experiment with formats beyond its namesake cafes.

After
 acquiring a chain of packaged tea stores called Teavana, for instance, 
the company last year opened an outpost in New York City modeled more 
after a pricey cafe that serves small bites and prepared tea drinks.

Starbucks
 is opening a chain that stays open until 10 p.m. and switches from 
lunchtime to dinnertime to compete with chains like Panera who absorb 22
 per cent of their sales at dinnertime while its competitors are closed 
for business, reports Bloomberg Businessweek.

Even comparable restaurant chains like Le Pain Quotidian close at 7 p.m. giving Starbucks' La Boulange an evening advantage.

As for the company's future plans with La Boulange, Mills said, 'We're going to see how this one goes.'

Starbucks, based in Seattle, has more than 20,000 locations around the world.
