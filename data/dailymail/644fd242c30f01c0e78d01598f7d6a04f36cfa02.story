A police force grappling with budget cuts has teamed up with its fire and rescue service to create a squad car which doubles as a make-shift engine. 

The Rural Intervention Vehicle (RIV) will be used by a policeman and fireman at the same time, with officers tasked with patrolling Northamptonshire in search of dangerous situations or emergencies. 

Equipped with a foldable ladder and siren, the car has been hailed as a 'valuable' joint venture, and is said to be able to reach emergencies faster than large engines.

The Rural Intervention Vehicle has been created in a joint venture between Northamptonshire Police and the local fire and rescue service following a series of budget cuts

While the RIV will never be sent to blazes in the place of specially-equipped vehicles, it will be used to assist fire fighters and assess potentially dangerous situations before they arrive. 

Speaking of the collaboration, Chief Superintendent Paul Fell said: 'The public are aware that all public services face significant financial challenges over the next few years, but this is genuinely about trying to provide a better service in a more cost-effective way to local communities.' 

District Commander Chief Inspector Dennis Murray said the scheme helped improve emergency services' 'accessibility' to the public. 

'The jointly crewed vehicle has improved the visibility and accessibility of police and fire services in rural areas, as well as enhancing support to local people in areas such as crime and fire prevention and dealing with ongoing local problems.'

PC John Vjestica and Watch Manager Justin Abbott have been using the vehicle in a trial run across the area

Critics claimed the venture could put fire fighters at risk violent and unpleasant treatment by the public 

While Northamptonshire Fire Service welcomed the project as a 'quicker, more comprehensive response' to danger, critics said it could risk putting fire fighters susceptible to crime. 

'When a fireman turns up to a job he is always welcome, people know he is there to help. 

'If they are associated with the police I'm afraid they will not be quite as welcome,' said Lib Dem Councillor Sally Beardsworth.

Labour councillor John McGee added: 'Any proposed single authority or merger would be driven by cuts - and that's not good for the public.'

Among tasks undertaken by the RIV in its trial period was visiting schools and community groups to deliver personal safety talks and advising local businesses and farms on hazard concerns.
