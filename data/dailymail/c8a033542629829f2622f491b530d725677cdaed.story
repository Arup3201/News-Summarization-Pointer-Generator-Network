Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne joked that he has nearly died '19 times' during his drinking bouts  as he spoke about his ongoing battle with the bottle in a TV interview.

The 47-year-old admitted today that he 'knew he was in trouble straight away' after his most recent relapse - which saw him placed on a three-day emergency detox last month.

He also spoke candidly about how his drinking affects his parents - revealing that his mother still gets upset and that his father swears at him every time he falls off the wagon.

Healthy: Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne joked that he has nearly died '19 times' during his drinking bouts as he spoke about his ongoing battle with the bottle in an interview on ITV's This Morning

The former football star, who retired from the game in 2004, said that he wasn't in a 'massive state' during his most recent relapse, but admitted that it was enough 'to get himself into trouble'.

Speaking in an interview on ITV's This Morning, Gascoigne looked healthy and relaxed as he told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes about his struggle.

He said that he was able to recognise his most recent slip and blamed public speculation on not being able to bounce back sooner. 

He said: This time I knew I was in trouble straight away so I tried to put a block on it pretty quickly. 

'I was just detoxing in my house, and all of a sudden I just felt I was set up by a few people with regards to the latest stint, and then I just decided to carry on drinking, which wasn't the right thing. 

'I should have just gone and had a word with a few people which I didn't do. I know all the right things to do, and I just stopped doing it.

When asked about how his family reacted to seeing photos of him looking frail, Gascoigne said that his parents still struggled - even though they are used to seeing it. 

He said: 'I think they're quite used to it. It's embarrassing to say, but I think they're used to it. 

'My mum gets really upset, my dad - I can't swear on the show but he's like what the **** are you up to now, and that - but then I go up to visit them.' 

The former midfielder then revealed that he thinks he has only spent 'a year and a bit' of the last 18 years drinking. 

Sounding surprised at his response, Mr Holmes asked him how many times he had 'nearly died' over that same period, to which Gascoigne quipped, '19!'

Gascoigne, who made 57 appearances for England, was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008 following an incident at a Newcastle hotel.

Following his latest sectioning in the early hours of October 24, the star was placed on a three-day emergency detox following an apparent alcohol binge.

During his time in hospital, he is said to have taken the opportunity to improve his health and fitness by doing up to 800 press-ups, sit-ups and squats every day.

First outing: Gascoigne was spotted putting the bins out in his pyjamas earlier this month in his first public appearance since  being sectioned under the Mental Health Act on October 24

Since returning to his seaside home, in Poole, Dorset, he is said to have continued with his exercise regime and his efforts appeared to be paying off when he was spotted shopping for groceries last week.

He smiled towards onlookers as he bought groceries including milk and air freshener, alongside a copy of The Sun and Hello! magazine.

During his outing to the supermarket, he also visited an off-licence - but only to buy cigarettes.  full
