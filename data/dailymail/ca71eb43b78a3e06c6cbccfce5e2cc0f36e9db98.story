A former mayor and his wife accused of the murder of 43 trainee teachers were the stars of one of the world's biggest carnivals before they were incinerated.

Effigies of Jose Luis Abarca, former mayor of Iguala, Mexico, and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda, were set ablaze in a ceremony to get rid of evil spirits and ill feelings.

The couple are currently in jail after they were charged with the kidnapping of 43 trainee teachers in Iguala last September. It is believed they ordered corrupt police to arrest the students and hand them over to gangsters.

None of the students have been seen since.

The scandal has rocked Mexico, which is fighting a long-running war against criminal cartels who control the flow of drugs to the lucrative U.S. market north of the border.

So when the time came for organisers of the International Mazatlan Carnival to choose a figure for its annual Quema del Mal Humor (Bad Mood Burning) ritual on Saturday, their decision had practically been made for them.

The climax of the ritual is the incineration of a giant puppet, usually modelled after a public figure. 'Think massive exploding piñata on steroids,' says one tourism website. 

Organisers of the carnival in Sinaloa, which is listed as one of the world's top three by Forbes, chose the couple because they represented the most evil people locals could think of.

Director of Culture of Mazatlan, Raul Rico Gonzalez, said: 'They were chosen because they epitomised the new political masters who enriched themselves regardless of the cost to the welfare and indeed the lives of others.'

Crowds cheered as the effigies burst into flames, spewing fireworks at the climax of Saturday night's ritual.

Abarca and Pineda were tracked down last November to a squalid flat in Mexico City. They went on the run when suspicion turned on them over the disappearance of 43 student teachers.

The students vanished after they were taken into custody by police. It is alleged that police handed them over to a local drug gang controlled by Pineda, a scion of a Mexican crime family.

Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said the cartel's leader, Sidronio Casarrubias Salgado, describes Pineda as 'the main operator of criminal activities in Iguala'.

She allegedly believed the students had come to town to disrupt a speech she was going to make, but it has since been claimed they were merely passing through on their way to Mexico City.

They were apparently set to attend for a service in the Mexican capital in remembrance of students massacred there in 1968.

The case has spurred anger across the country, and large protest marches demanding action by the government have been held in Mexico City, Acapulco and the capital of the state of Guerrero, Chilpancingo.
