Ms Hansen claims she was holding the equipment, which was found in a wardrobe, for friends and denied that the substances found in the room were drugs.

She told the court the heart-shaped tablets seized by police were breath mints from clothing store, Sportsgirl, and not ecstasy.

'I don't want to be involved in the drug world… I want to have my life back on track,' Ms Hansen told the magistrate.
