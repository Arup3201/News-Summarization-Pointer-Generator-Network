Attorneys for Michael Jackson's family on Monday accused his concert promoter, AEG, of ignoring 'red flags' about his drug addiction and ill health in a ruthless pursuit of profits.

AEG Live is the second-largest concert promoter in the nation and Jackson family lawyer Brian Panish told jurors that the company's only priority was overtaking its competition, Live Nation.

'They wanted to be No. 1 at all costs,' he said.

Monday marked the beginning the trial for a wrongful death suit brought by the Kind of Pop's mother, Katherine Jackson, who claims AEG executives ordered Dr Conrad Murray to heavily medicate Jackson to ensure he continued to perform, despite pain and injury.

The wrongful-death suit contends the 
entertainment firm threatened to end Jackson’s career if he failed to 
come through with the concerts and ordered Murray to keep the performer 
on track.

AEG officials have denied any 
wrongdoing, and the company's lawyers have said executives could not have 
foreseen the circumstances that led to the physician giving Jackson doses 
of the anesthetic propofol as a sleep aid.

'Forget about helping Mr' Jackson,' Panish said. 'The show must go on.'

AEG's attorney Marvin S. Putnam, however, said the singer's guarded private life meant the company was unaware that he was using powerful drugs.

'The truth is, Michael Jackson fooled everyone,' Putnam said. 'He made sure that no one, nobody, knew his deepest darkest secrets.'

Panish said that AEG is the only 
entity that claims it didn’t know about Jackson’s addiction to 
prescription drugs.

The addiction began, Panish says, following an infamous 1984 accident the filming of a Pepsi commercial that set Jackson's hair on fire. The singer suffered second and third burns and never fully recovered.

A jury of six men and six women will determine whether AEG is liable and any damages award.

AEG Live, the second-largest concert promoter in the world, owed a duty to
properly investigate the doctor who treated Michael Jackson, Panish argued.

'His stirring voice, his musical 
genius, his creativity and his generosity and his huge heart was 
extinguished forever,' he told jurors. 

Katherine Jackson is suing AEG 
claiming it failed to properly investigate the doctor convicted of 
involuntary manslaughter over Jackson’s death.

'You’re going to hear the whole story about what happened in the death of Michael Jackson,' Panish said.

Panish made his remarks in an opening
presentation filled with slides detailing the case against AEG, which 
was promoting Jackson’s planned comeback tour, This Is It.

Jackson’s mother, brother Randy and 
sister Rebbie sat in the front row of the courtroom as Panish detailed 
aspects of Jackson’s life.

Millions, and possibly billions, of dollars are at stake.

Katherine Jackson sued the company in
September 2010, claiming it failed to properly investigate former 
physician Conrad Murray before allowing him to serve as Jackson’s tour 
doctor.

She is also suing on behalf of her son’s three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket.

AEG denies it hired Murray, saying he was hired by Jackson himself.

The company's lawyer have said they could not have foreseen the circumstances that 
led to Jackson’s death at age 50.

This Jackson trial has become a media spectacle, just like all of the previous court cases involving the King of Pop

A jury convicted Murray of giving 
Jackson a fatal dose of the anesthetic propofol in 2011. The 
hospital-grade anesthetic was being administered as a sleep aid.

Panish told jurors they would be putting together a puzzle, with three pieces being Jackson, Murray and AEG Live.

He told the panel that Jackson 
suffered from addiction to prescription medications and Demerol at times
during his life, and the problem increased when he was keeping up a 
rigorous schedule.

'Over the years Michael family’s and 
people who knew him believed he had a problem with prescription 
medication,' Panish told jurors.

The lawyer showed a brief clip of 
Jackson rehearing for the This Is It shows and a clip of the singer 
dancing in the early stages of his presentation.

He also showed footage of a 1999 show
in Munich in which Jackson was performing when a bridge dropped 50 feet
with the singer on it. Despite pain, Jackson continued performing, 
Panish said.

Panish said Jackson turned to Demerol to relieve his pain.

Katherine Jackson and her two oldest grandchildren, Prince and Paris, are listed as possible witnesses.

An AEG attorney said on Monday that the company intends to call Murray as a witness in the case as well. Murray did not testify at his criminal trial and his lawyers said he will invoke the Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination if called to testify in this case.

Panish told jurors they would have to determine who was responsible for Jackson’s death.

'Michael paid the ultimate price. He died,' Panish said. 'Michael has taken responsibility.'

Hundreds of private emails detailing 
Michael Jackson’s dramatic deterioration in his final days will play a 
key role in the trial.

The messages sent by executives at 
AEG, the US entertainment giant behind the star’s doomed comeback tour, 
reveal the 50-year-old singer’s turmoil as he struggled with his health 
and inner demons to prepare for the lucrative concerts.

According to a senior AEG lawyer, the company is likely to bring up Jackson’s drug shopping as well as his acquittal on child molestation charges as part of their case that the promoter had no liability in the tragedy.

The Jackson family's lawyers are likely to zero in on the emails they claim show how aware the company’s senior executives were of the singer's fragile state.

When Randy Phillips, a promoter at AEG, 
went to Jackson’s London hotel suite the day before the singer announced
his comeback concerts he found him so drunk that he had to dress him.

‘MJ is locked in his room drunk and despondent. I [am] trying to sober him up,’ Phillips wrote to the company’s president Tim Leiweke.

In the US where Mr Leiweke had just woken up, he replied: ‘Are you kidding me?’

‘I screamed at him so loud the walls are shaking. He is an emotionally paralysed mess riddled with self loathing and doubt now that it is show time,' Mr Phillips responded.

By June that year the alarm bells were ringing and a production manager wrote that Jackson was a ‘basket case'.

The show’s director, Kenny Ortega, who had known Jackson for two decades, called for him to be evaluated by a psychiatrist. He also said the star would have to lip synch some of his songs because he was racked by ‘paranoia, anxiety and obsessive-like behaviour’.

After Jackson's, Mr Phillips wrote in August 2009: ‘Michael’s death is a terrible tragedy, but life must go on. AEG will make a fortune from merch sales, ticket retention, the touring exhibition and the film/dvd.’

AEG would go on to earn about £160 million from the documentary film This Is It, which featured rehearsal footage.

Lawyers representing the company will claim that Murray was hired by Jackson and not by the promoter. The civil trial jury took more than three weeks to select.

The Jacksons are seeking a judgment against AEG equal to the money he would have earned over the course of his remaining lifetime had he not died in 2009, plus exorbitant damages.
