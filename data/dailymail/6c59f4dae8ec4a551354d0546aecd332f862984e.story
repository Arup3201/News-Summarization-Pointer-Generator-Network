ABC has announced that Barbara Walters will have the first interview with UC-Santa Barbara shooter Elliot Rodger's father.

Peter Rodger has not spoken out about his son's killing spree that left six dead and 13 others injured before killing himself.

The special will mark the famed broadcaster's first return to television since she retired last month.

His side of the story: Barbara Walters will tape an interview with Peter Rodger, the filmmaker father of Isla Vista killer Elliot Rodger, in her first return to television since her retirement last month

Final warning: Elliot Rodger posted a confessional video titled 'Retribution' shortly before going on a killing spree near the UC-Santa Barbara campus in May

ABC did not reveal when the interview will air, saying only that it will be an upcoming special edition of 20/20.

The killer's mother, Li-Chin Rodger, was the first one to realize that something was awry at the time of his killing spree.

Li-Chin, who have been divorced for many years, received an email from her 22-year-old son shortly after 9pm on May 25 which included a 140-page manifesto.

She immediately went to Elliot's YouTube page and saw that he had uploaded a video called 'Retribution' wherein he describes how he plans to slaughter sorority girls.Â 

Treatment: A family spokesman previously said that Peter Rodger (right) and his ex-wife had made sure that Elliot (left) was receiving treatment

His mother knew something was horribly wrong and she called her ex, filmmaker Peter, and after they watched the video, they called 911.

Both parents rushed to the scene separately and reportedly realized they were too late once they heard news reports of the ongoing rampage on the car radio.

Neither parent has spoken out about the killings yet, and in the immediate aftermath they gave permission to a close friend to speak to the media on their behalf, explaining how Elliot had been receiving professional help for some time.

'(His parents) were conscious and concerned about their son's health,' Simon Astaire told CNN.

'They thought he was in good hands.'

Part of the deal: When Walters retired last month, she said that she would still come back to work from time to time on the 20/20 Interview Specials (pictured during one such interview in 2013)
