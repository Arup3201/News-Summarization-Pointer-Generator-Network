The economic forecasts are gloomy and the threat of a double-dip recession looms large.

Tomorrow the Bank of England will slash growth prospects to just 1 per cent down from 1.5 per cent just three months ago.

It's not what a Chancellor toiling away for long hours at the helm of the economy needs to hear. Combined with the plethora of European summits it all appears to have left the more rotund than usual George Osborne with less time to go to the gym.

George Osborne returns to Downing Street this morning after a brisk jog with what appears to be a more rotund than usual waistline

But this morning he stepped out into the morning gloom for a brisk morning jog in shorts and grey sweater.

The
Chancellor is also aiming to get the economy moving at a faster pace 
with a series of schemes for new toll roads, housing and power stations 
to kickstart growth.

Adding to his woes youth unemployment is expected to hit 
one million for the first time since records began more than 20 years 
ago and fresh details have emerged of Coalition infighting over their 
plans to get the economy moving, with Business Secretary Vince Cable 
ruling out Tory proposals to freeze benefits.

The Treasury is desperate to get 
money flowing into the economy now by bringing forward major building 
projects that might not have got off the ground for several years.

What a difference a year makes: George Osborne in October 2010

Insiders stress that the Government will not change its deficit reduction plans, since that would be an admission they have resorted to Plan B.

Instead, Mr Osborne is relying on money sitting idle in private sector pension funds and insurance schemes.

Under the proposals, to be announced in the growth review on November 29, private investors will be asked to pay £50billion into infrastructure investment funds.

In exchange for their cash now, 
investors would get paid a dividend later in the form of tolls from new 
roads, rental income from houses or a slice of energy bills.

The
plans will flood the construction industry with cash and boost jobs but
are likely to hit consumers in the long-term in the form of higher 
motoring and electricity costs.

A No 10 source said: ‘Pension funds are sitting on large amounts of capital and are reluctant to put money in.

‘There’s very little public money 
available so it makes sense to tap that money.’

Today Mr Osborne also insisted once again that the UK will not not bear the financial cost of bailing out the single currency.

Writing in the Evening Standard, he said: 'The financial risks of standing behind the currency will ultimately be borne by eurozone citizens. The eurozone has the financial capacity to restore stability. They now need to deploy it without delay.'

Mr Osborne also restated his opposition to a Financial Transaction Tax, warning that a levy on financial trading would be 'economic suicide' for Britain and Europe.

The Chancellor said: 'Proposals for a Europe-only Financial Transactions Tax are a bullet aimed at the heart of London. The EU should be coming forward with new ideas to promote growth, not undermine it.'

Despite 'grounds for optimism' following the formation of new governments in Greece and Italy, Mr Osborne warned that 'this remains the most dangerous moment for the world economy since Lehman Brothers went down in the autumn of 2008.'

Once the immediate crisis is overcome, 'over time eurozone countries will have to pool more resources and share more control over each other's tax and spending decisions', said the Chancellor.

'Frankly, this is a big loss of national sovereignty for those countries. It is one of the reasons I have always opposed Britain joining the euro. But it is the only way to make a currency union work for the long term.

'Britain will not be part of this fiscal integration and this Government will make sure that our national interests and our voice in the EU are protected.'

At odds: Nick Clegg, seen here with the Prime Minister, has blocked Tory-backed proposals to make it easier to sack people in order to lessen the burden on small businesses

Ed Balls said he welcomed the fund but added that one cannot have investment projects which don't affect borrowing

Mr Osborne has Lib Dem 
support for his building projects, but friction remains at the top of the Coalition 
about other plans.

Nick Clegg has blocked Tory-backed proposals to make it easier to sack people in order to lessen the burden on small businesses.

And Mr Cable yesterday ruled out plans floated by the Tories to freeze benefits, rather than uprate them in line with inflation.

He said: ‘There is no doubt, of course they should be indexed and that’s fully understood.’

But the Business Secretary did back the £50billion growth plans. He said: ‘What we have to do is create a framework regulation so that private investors will have the confidence to invest in big projects and help get the British economy moving again.’

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls welcomed plans for the fund.

But he added: ‘You can’t have public investment projects which don’t affect borrowing, which somehow rely upon the private sector. There is no meat there.’

Mr Osborne said last night: ‘I fully accept we need to have more initiatives, more government plans to stimulate housing, to get homes being built, to help construction, help infrastructure, help small businesses get more credit.

‘We’re going to announce plans for all those things in the next few weeks.’

The taxman's relentless pursuit of those who owe money has seen a four-fold increase in the use of legal powers to seize the assets of late-paying companies. 

In the past two years, HM Revenue & Customs has used its ‘distraint’ powers to seize assets for auction on 7,004 businesses – up from 1,675 in 2009. In many cases the actions left company bosses with no choice but to shut up shop. 

Assets seized are often sold on at fire sale prices that fail to even cover the full amount of unpaid taxes and reduce the chances of other creditors being repaid. Tax experts believe the aggressive pursuit is down to huge pressure being piled on to HMRC, which is also facing staffing cuts. 

Stuart McNeill, partner at accountants McGrigors, said: ‘By barging in and selling the assets of a late-paying company without making a proper commercial assessment of the firm’s medium-term viability, HMRC risks sacrificing full payment in a few months’ time for far less cash upfront.’ 

Taxpayers are meant to be able to negotiate late payment of taxes through the Government’s ‘Time to Pay’ scheme. 

But since HMRC was stripped of its ‘preferred creditor’ status in 2003, the taxman is no longer first in line to recoup any money owed if a company goes bust. 

‘If they don’t take an informed commercial view, they may be dealing the killer blow to some companies with a good chance of survival – and increasing the unemployment figures,’ said Mr McNeill. 

An HMRC spokesman said it uses its powers when ‘other avenues are exhausted’.
