Lying deep in the rolling Devon countryside, this house is a long way from the nearest pub.

But that won't be a problem for whoever buys it, because Brick House in Mamhead, near Exeter, which is for sale for £1.15million, comes with its very own vineyard.

Drinks will be on the new owner of the four-bedroom Grade II* listed country house, which boasts a 3.5 acre plantation of vines and currently produces about 4,000 bottles a year.

Brick House, which is for sale for £1.15million, lies in a secluded valley near Exeter, Devon, and boasts 3.5 acres of vineyards which produce 4,000 bottles of wine a year

The vines were planted with Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir grapes in 2006 by owners Gary Bullard and Elaine Sullivan, who bought the house the previous year

House with a history: The four-bedroom house dates back to the 18th century and is featured in a book from the 1780s called Travels In Georgian Devon

The unusual-looking property, which could be extended, is believed to have been named Brick House because it was rare to build a house out of bricks at the time

Owners Gary Bullard and Elaine Sullivan, who bought the property in 2005 and planted the vineyard of Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir grapes a year later, produce white and rose wine, which they sell to friends, family and local restaurants. 

First mentioned in a book named Travels In Georgian Devon, which was published in the 1780s, the brick-built house was a rarity in its day, hence the name. 

As well as the vineyards, it comes with paddocks, barns, gardens and woodlands totalling 20 acres, and lies in a private valley with far-reaching rural views. 

Mr Bullard, a company director from Richmond, Surrey, said he and his partner were selling their second home to move closer to his in-laws in Dorset.

He said: 'I'm a wine enthusiast and collector, and when I lived in France I used to travel around the vineyards.

'We bought land around the house and we decided it would be fantastic to look over your own vineyard.  We had a specialist come and look at the soil and advise us on what grapes to go with, but we decided on Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir.

Rural solitude: The house lies deep in the tranquil Devon countryside, but getting a drink won't be a problem given the vineyards included in the price tag

It is currently used as a second home by wine enthusiasts Gary Bullard and Elaine Sullivan, whose main home is in Richmond, Surrey, but they want to buy in Dorset

Nice spot for a glass of wine: The property comes with paddocks, woodlands, gardens, a pond and a stream, as well as its own vineyards, so peace is guaranteed

Vines: Brick House's owner, Mr Bullard, said he took advice on which grapes to plant after he bought the property in 2005, and chose to go for 'quantity over quality'

Beamed dining room: With endless rural views and a (practically) endless supply of wine, Brick House would make a good place for a party

Country living: The estate agent selling the house, Savills' Richard Addington, said: 'This house is in the most lovely position and is a proper, miniature country estate'

'These grapes aren't grown much in the UK, and they ripen quite late in the year, but we wanted to go for quality over quantity.' 

The property, which also has its own stream, pond, and a stone barn used as a workshop and games room, is being sold by estate agents Savills.

Savills' Richard Addington said: 'This house is in the most lovely position and is surrounded by farmland.  It has four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and the owners also have planning permission to join the barn and the house together. 

'It's a proper miniature country estate.' 

 

Bottoms up! The vineyard is planted with grapes which can produce white white - Sauvignon Blanc - or red wine in the form of Pinot Noir
