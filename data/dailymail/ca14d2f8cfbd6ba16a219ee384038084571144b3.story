An American health care worker who may have been infected with Ebola has been flown to a specialist center in the United States to be tested.

The patient, who had been aiding efforts in west Africa, will be monitored at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.

Emory was the first hospital to treat Americans who had contracted the virus while working in Ebola-struck areas.

The hospital houses a specialized isolation unit that handled four of the 10 Ebola patients previously treated in the U.S. 

A hospital spokeswoman confirmed the patient was being flown in yesterday, but did not reveal any details. 

'An American health care worker from West Africa who may have been exposed to the Ebola virus is being transferred to Emory University Hospital's Serious Communicable Diseases Unit for monitoring and observation to see if an infection has been acquired,' the medical center said in a statement.

'We do not have a time of arrival and cannot share more details out of respect for patient privacy and in accordance with the patient's wishes.'

On Tuesday, U.S. health officials designated 35 hospitals across the nation as Ebola treatment centers

The news comes after federal officials designated 35 hospitals across the United States, including Emory, as Ebola treatment centers. 

The Ebola outbreak ravaging west Africa has claimed 6,070 lives, according to the latest WHO update, with the vast majority of deaths in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

To date, 10 people have been treated for Ebola in the United States, of whom eight -- all Americans -- survived.

On Tuesday, a patient was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital and tested for Ebola due of previous visits to areas where Ebola was rife and symptoms of the disease were present.  

The patient tested positive for malaria but although an initial test for Ebola came back negative, doctors have yet to rule it out, reported The Boston Globe. 

Dr. David Hooper, chief of Mass. General's infection control unit, said: 'We have to be absolutely sure before we finish up here.'

He explained the first test sometimes fails to detect the virus and a patient can only be declared clear is a second test a few days later also comes back negative.

A patient admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital this week tested positive for malaria and an initial test for Ebola came back negative, but doctors have not yet ruled it out
