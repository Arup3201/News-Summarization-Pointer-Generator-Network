A nationwide strike in Belgium has brought rail, road and air transport to a standstill and seen protesters try to hurl eggs and fireworks at government offices. 

The 24 hour strike is the country's first general strike since 2005 and comes in the wake of a new government's plans to save £8.7billion in the next five years. 

In the Belgian capital of Brussels, police resisted striking workers who tried to throw eggs and fireworks at the offices of Flemish separatist party N-VA, one of the four parties in the Belgian government.

The strike forced hundreds of factories and offices to shut. Around 600 flights were grounded at Brussels Airport today and Eurostar cancelled all Brussels-bound trains in France. 

Most trains on the high-speed Thalys link line between Paris and Brussels were also cancelled, with local bus, tram and metro services also affected. 

At the port of Antwerp, one of the busiest in Europe, more than 50 ships were unable to enter or leave. 

In the western city of Ghent, unions blocked a major road by a plant of steelmaker ArcelorMittal.

Unions called the strike a great success, but Flemish business group Voka said 77 percent of the firms it surveyed in Brussels and the northern region of Flanders had all their workers in.

A siege in Ghent, which turned out to be a hoax, also meant the impact of the strike was overshadowed.

Unions are opposing a decision by Prime Minister Charles Michel - Belgium's new leader - to scrap a cost-of-living wage next year. Belgian law currently mandates that wage rise at the same pace as inflation. 

They are also protesting against public sector cutbacks and plans to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67. 

These reforms are part of a plan to plug the country's budget deficit, which stands at 3 per cent of GDP for 2014. 

The public sector movement began early last month with 100,000 people taking part in a march in Brussels that ended in clashes leaving 112 police injured.

Several vehicles were set alight by protesters who also hurled stones and flares at police. About 50 people were hurt and 30 detained, officials said.

Mr Michel was sworn in as prime minister in October. The 38-year-old French-speaking liberal is Belgium's youngest leader since 1841.
