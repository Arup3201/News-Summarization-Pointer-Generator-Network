Pretty Millie Mackintosh has been one of the best-loved Made In Chelsea cast members since the E4 reality show took our screens by storm back in 2011.

And whilst she may have reportedly quit the BAFTA-winning series to 
join her rapper fiance on tour in America after they tie the knot later 
this year, that hasn't stopped her from working hard.

The Quality Street heiress's latest job sees her smouldering in a 60s inspired shoot for fashion e-tailer Very.co.uk.

Endless legs: Made In Chelsea starlet Millie Mackintosh shows off her enviable curves as she models Love Label for Very.co.uk

Millie started out as a make-up artist more accustomed to working behind the scenes on shoots, but here she proves that that she can hold her own in front of the camera.

In fact she is no stranger to modelling, and 
her extensive profile has seen her work with brands such as St Tropez, 
Umberto Giannini, Manuka Doctor and Aspinal of London as well as dress brand Lipsy. who sold out of most of the pieces she was snapped in.

In these pictures the reality TV star-turned-model-turned-style blogger shows off her famous long legs and enviable curves in the high summer shoot for Very.co.uk's own brand, Love Label, as she poses in a selection of holiday outfits.

In one shot, Millie can be seen jumping in the air donning a pair of glitzy Gatsby-inspired jeans and skimpy black top.

In another, she shows off her never-ending legs as she sits on a vintage scooter in barely-there pastel hot pants.
