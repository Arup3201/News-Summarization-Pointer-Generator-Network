A woman is suing Fedex over her wife’s $400,000 spousal death benefit – which the company is refusing to pay because it would not recognize their marriage.

Lesly Taboada-Hall, who was a driver for the company for 26 years, lost her battle with uterine cancer two years ago.

But because she died six days before a landmark Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage, FedEx determined that wife Stacy Schuett, of California, was not eligible to receive the pension benefit, her lawyers say.

NBC News reported that Ms Taboada-Hall passed away on June 20, 2013 – days before the Supreme Court struck down an important part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) which blocked federal recognition of gay marriage.

Some firms used DOMA to decide who was the legal souse before paying out survivor benefits.

Although FedEx did recognize 54-year-old Ms Schuett as a spouse for smaller survivor benefits, her lawyers believe she should be entitled to more.

NBC News reported that the pair were married in hospital just a day before Ms Taboada-Hall died and that a judge in California later ruled the marriage was valid.

The legal team for Ms Schuett, who has two children aged 19 and 15, have sued in the federal court, claiming the Supreme Court ruling should apply ‘retroactively’.

She told NBC News that her wife had enjoyed working for FedEx and that the firm had treated her well during her battle with cancer – but that the couple learned of the company’s decision a week before her death.

She said: ‘To discover at the 11th hour that there was this other looming problem was pretty shocking to us. She was really worried about what was going to be happening to us after she died.’

NBC News quotes a FedEx spokesman as saying that it was ‘saddened’ by the passing of Ms Taboada-Hall and that she was a valued member of staff adding: ‘Ms Schuett's claim has been carefully reviewed, and while we are sympathetic to her situation, we are required by federal law to apply the pension plan rules equally to all participants.’
