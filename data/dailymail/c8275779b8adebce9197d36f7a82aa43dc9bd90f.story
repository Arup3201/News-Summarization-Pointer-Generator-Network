It has come under fire in recent months for becoming ever-more intrusive into the lives of the people who use it.

However Facebook's most revealing revamp yet will unveil the lives of its millions of users like never before as it delves into people's histories and publishes the information in a 'magazine-style' format.

Mixed reaction has met the social networking site's impressive new revamp, with some labelling it as 'creepy but beautiful' and other critics raising concerns about privacy.

Facebook's new 'timeline' feature - a 
new, deeper profile which allows you to 'fill in' more of your life 
pre-Facebook - was announced with some fanfare in September.

The 'timeline' view will give your Facebook page a more 'magazine-like' feel - and will, Mark Zuckerberg promises, 'tell the story of your life'

Timeline allows you to organise your life into a chronological view - and you can even add the years 'pre-Facebook'

Today, the company announced, 'Starting today, timeline is now available everywhere.'

Mark
 Zuckerberg described timeline as letting you 'tell the whole story of 
your life on a single page'. At present, the 'new look' is voluntary - 
but a company spokesperson said it will become compulsory in 'a few 
weeks'.

PaidContent described the makeover as
 'creepy but beautiful', adding: 'Facebook appears to have gained at 
least a minor awareness of how intrusive the site can feel.

'With timeline, it is letting users 
have a week grace period to tweak and review the page before they spring
 their entire life on the rest of the world.

'I strongly recommend everyone use this one week to understand how timeline works before hitting the ‘Publish Now’ button.'

In a move which appears to try and reassure users of the timeline feature, both Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg and pop idol Britney Spears both now boast the new-look format on their profiles.

The redesigned pages have a more magazine-like photo-heavy feel, with a large 'cover photo' at the top of the page.

On
 the right of the page there will be a timeline that breaks down all 
posts from a person's time on Facebook and allows viewers to jump back 
to people's earliest posts with a break down month-by-month.

Facebook's new 'timeline' profiles highlight pictures from years ago - but deleting pictures you don't like may be no defence

Facebook's creator Mark Zuckerberg led by example by opting-in to the new profile feature

Tech site CIO.com commented, 'Facebook's
 new timeline has the potential to expose status updates and wall posts 
from years ago,' and published a guide to 'Important Privacy Settings to
 Adjust Now.'

You can choose to 'feature' or 'hide'
 posts that you particularly want highlighted or hidden - but from the 
moment you opt in, you only have seven days to do so.

'When you upgrade to timeline, you'll
 have seven days to review everything that appears on your timeline 
before anyone else can see it,' the site says.

'If
 you decide to wait, your timeline will go live automatically after 
seven days. Your new timeline will replace your profile, but all your 
stories and photos will still be there.'

The all-inclusive, show-everything 
approach has clearly made some users nervous, 'Time to untag some old 
photos,' commented one user via Twitter in the minutes after launch.

The redesigned Facebook 'timeline' has also been popular with users - although not with privacy advocates

Exposed: Even people's hobbies, such as film interests (left) and which games they enjoy playing (right), will be revealed for all to see as part of the new-look site

Connections: Facebook's links with music site Spotify will also reveal exactly what bands you are listening to

American business magazine Forbes commented, 'This is going to force users to do some privacy housekeeping. Limiting items to just your friends seems like a good privacy control, but that depends on how liberal you’ve been in friending people.'

A technology class at Yale has already created a quiz called 'What's Her Face-book' to work out exactly how well they know people who they are connected to via the site.

The new look is much more 'picture-heavy' - and your profile suddenly becomes a showcase for everything you have ever posted.

Friends become big pictures, and the site also posts much larger versions of pictures you've taken, shared or been tagged in.

Timeline
 will also be open to app developers, so that the information can be 
used to supercharge apps such as music-sharing application Spotify.

Timeline

 has been available to a million developers in an early test version 
already - but so far has only been available to the public in New 
Zealand, chosen as a test bed, presumably, because it has a relatively 
low 
population - just 4.4 million - and is English-speaking, allowing 
Facebook to iron out early problems with the service.

One of the new features is 'Cover' - a big picture that you pick to represent yourself, and which forms the top of 'timeline', which replaces your old profile

Facebook are keen to trumpet the fact you can 'hide' features from your 'timeline'

You can also edit your timeline for specific Facebook users - but the site only gives you seven days to edit before 'going live', so this feature may be too fiddly for many

The Activity Log lets you review and manage everything you share on Facebook

The
 new-look format may prompt many to re-evaluate how much they want to 
share on Facebook, with some users proclaiming this latest change is one
 step too far.

Early reactions suggest this 
development could drive users away from the site, with some fearing the 
privacy settings could be so confusing it might be easier to leave 
Facebook altogether.

The biggest piece of advice 
offered so far on the changes is make sure you understand how timeline 
works before hitting the 'publish now' button. This may force many to carry out some privacy housekeeping on the site.

When
 profiles migrate to the timeline magazine format, users will have seven
 days to scrutinise and approve its content before it is published 
online. But it will be up to you to decide who sees this information.

To friend or not to friend? The What's Her face-Book quiz helps users establish how many of their connections they truly know

Users are advised to use this 
week-long grace period to study the contents meticulously and to make 
the necessary privacy adjustments to ensure their life history is not 
published for the world to see. After seven days, the timeline format 
will automatically be published to your profile.

Every
 picture, comment and piece of information contained within timeline 
will feature a privacy drop-down menu, asking who you want to view it, 
whether it be the public, close friends, colleagues or any other 
sub-group of users on Facebook.

Many
 users might think they are being cautious by limiting their information
 to only their 'friends' list, but this throws up another dilemma: How 
many of your Facebook 'friends' do you actually know?

If
 you have been too liberal in adding and accepting 'friends' on 
Facebook, there's a chance you'll be sharing information with people you
 barely know.

A new quiz called What's Her Face-Book
 tests users on how many people they really know on the site by showing 
them randomly-selected pictures of their 'friends' and asking them to 
identify them.

Based on 
your score at the end of the quiz, users will be advised on whether to 
keep friends or delete them before allowing them unrestricted access to 
personal pictures and other information in the timeline feature.
