A charity worker claims he was sexually abused by a female soap star when he was just 16.

Robert Jones, now 48, claims the actress targeted him in her home when he was a vulnerable teenager and pulled him into her bedroom.

The father-of-three, who waived his right to anonymity, says that he has come forward only now because he wants the woman to 'answer for what she did'.

He told the Daily Mirror that he was grabbed by the arm and that the assault lasted less than half an hour when he was 16 in 1981.

Mr Jones told the newspaper: 'I remember going to a small place within myself.

'I kept thinking "Just get through it, it'll be over soon".

'This is something that I've never really got over and has hung over me most of my life.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said they were considering the allegations.

They said: 'A man contacted police on 16 October to report an incident which allegedly took place in 1981. This report is being considered.'

The allegation comes after a study showed a rise in reports of sexual offences; which was put partly down to greater numbers coming forward to report historical sexual offences to the police following the Savile inquiry.

The Office of National Stastics said: ‘There is evidence to suggest that these increases are partly a result of the Operation Yewtree investigation, initiated in October 2012 and connected to the Jimmy Savile inquiry.

‘Whilst some of these increases will be a direct consequence of the crimes reported as part of Operation Yewtree there is also evidence to suggest that there has been a wider “Yewtree effect”, whereby there is increased willingness on the part of the victims to come forward and report historical sexual offences that are not directly connected to Yewtree.

‘Additionally the publicity surrounding Operation Yewtree may have encouraged more victims to come forward and report more recent abuse cases.’

The scandal shows no sign of dying down, as BBC chiefs Lord Hall and Lord Patten will be grilled by MPs this week over an alleged ‘cover-up’ in the £3million inquiry into the Corporation’s failure to expose the Jimmy Savile scandal.

The Mail on Sunday understands the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee will call up Lord Hall, the BBC’s director-general since April, and Lord Patten, BBC Trust chairman, on Tuesday.

They will be asked about their refusal to investigate why key evidence about ex-BBC director-general Mark Thompson was excluded from the Pollard Review – the report into Newsnight’s axed expose of the disgraced DJ.
