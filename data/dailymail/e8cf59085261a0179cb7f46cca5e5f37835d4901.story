Ronda Rousey showed why she is the finest female combat fighter in the world with her 14-second victory over Cat Zingano in Los Angeles.

Here, Sportsmail looks back at the five fastest finishes in the UFC.

5=) Don Frye vs Thomas Ramirez - 8 seconds 

Don Frye took part in an eight-man openweight tournament at UFC 8 in 1996 and this knockout came in the quarter final when he knocked Thomas Ramirez out cold with his right hand.

Frye would go on to win the tournament but was the barred from his job as a fireman due to the controversy surrounding mixed martial arts at the time. Later in the year, he won the Ultimate Ultimate 96 tournament but then retired.

5=) James Irvin vs Houston Alexander - 8 seconds

Not only was this a quick knockout, it was particularly brutal. James Irwin landed with a superman punch and Houston Alexander simply fell to the canvas.

After a fight with Rashad Evans fell through, Irvin lost to future middleweight champion Anderson Silva and later tested positive for painkillers methadone and oxymorphone.

5=) Makwan Amirkhani vs Andy Ogle - 8 secondsAs debuts go, Makwan Amirkhani's was one to remember. In January, he landed with a flying knee to leave Andy Ogle on the canvas and the referee stepped in after a final flurry of punches. Unsurprisingly, the Finn earned the Performance of the Night bonus for his efforts.

2=) Todd Duffee vs Tim Hague - 7 seconds    

Everyone loves a heavyweight clash, and everyone loves a knockout, so Todd Duffee's seven-second KO of Tim Hague ticked all the boxes. It was a straight left that did the damage as Hague dropped the canvas before he was rescued by the referee.

Ironically, Duffee was on the end of a similarly brutal knockout in his next fight against Mike Russow - but this one came after 12 minutes. He had two spells with the UFC and remains an active fighter with independent promotions.

2=) Ryan Jimmo vs Anthony Perosh - 7 seconds   

Anthony Perosh had barely touched gloves before he was on his back from a devastating right hand from Ryan Jimmo and the referee did not need a second invitation to intervene. Jimmo has fought five times since but has failed to string two victories together.

2=) Chan Sung Jung vs Mark Hominick - 7 seconds

Chan Sung Jung - aka The Korean Zombie - had already won Submission of the Night on his UFC debut and added Knockout of the Night against Mark Hominick. Slipping a wild left hook from his opponent, Jung responded with a stiff right hand and a barrage of blows on the canvas. 

After a third victory in the promotion, against Dustin Poirier, Jung challenged Jose Aldo for the featherweight title, losing in the fourth round and dislocating shoulder. He is currently serving military service.

1) Duane Ludwig vs Jonathan Goulet - 6 seconds

Officially, Duane Ludwig's one-punch knockout of Jonathan Goulet was recorded at 11 seconds by the timekeeper. It was only after he petitioned the UFC that Ludwig was awarded with the organisation's fastest finish. 

He said: 'The record is very cool to have, because it separates me from every other human being past, present and very possibly future. That's some pretty cool stuff. Each athlete wants to stand out and this is a very big way to do so.'

Duane Ludwig had to petition the UFC to have his knockout of Jonathan Goulet recognised as six seconds
