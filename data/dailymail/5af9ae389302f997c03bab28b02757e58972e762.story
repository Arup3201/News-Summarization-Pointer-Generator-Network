Medics, marines and sailors waved farewell as a Royal Navy ship left for Sierra Leone today, loaded with aid, food, water and equipment to help treat people infected with the deadly Ebola virus in a bid to stop it spreading.

Prime Minister David Cameron has called for other countries to do more to tackle the epidemic, which has so far killed more than 4,500 people and has been deemed the 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times' by the World Health Organisation.

The Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) Argus, a navy ship, left Falmouth Docks in south west England for the 10-day journey to Sierra Leone - one of the west African countries worst hit by the disease.

The ship is carrying equipment to build medical units and life saving medical materials as well as thousands of bottles of water. It is due to stop at Gibraltar en route to collect more supplies to ensure as many people as possible can be treated.

A total of 380 personnel including medics and marines are on board the ship bound for Sierra Leone to treat patients infected with Ebola

Merlin helicopters will travel with the ship during its 10-day journey to Sierra Leone to support medical teams and aid workers on board 

Around 380 personnel - including 80 medics and 80 marines - set sail on the ship today as dozens lined the decks of the ship to wave goodbye to onlookers as it left the dock after waiting for high tide.

The ship could be stationed off the west coast of Africa for up to three months and is being termed a 'floating hospital'. It has a casualty unit and 100 beds but no patients will be brought aboard to prevent further transmission of the disease. Instead it will be used as a forward base for medics, engineers, soldiers and aid experts to build specialist medical units.

Captain David Eagles said all crew will be subject to strict checks to prevent the spread of Ebola. 

Any personnel infected with Ebola will be treated on shore and flown to a British treatment clinic in Kerry Town.

Earlier today David Cameron said Ebola was 'the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation' as he called for countries to do more to tackle the crisis.

The ship is travelling with three Merlin utility helicopters, air crew and engineers to provide transport and support to medical teams and aid workers. 

The personnel on board include medics who will use their expertise to try and combat the deadly outbreak of Ebola in west Africa

Troops with landing craft will escort personnel ashore and protect teams deployed on the ground.

Captain David Eagles, 52, of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, said his crew will be subjected to 'tough' regulations while aboard the giant ship to keep it sterile.

They will be banned from going ashore throughout the deployment and the Royal Marines who do will face a stringent decontamination process to re-board. 

The Ebola epidemic has gripped west Africa where the majority of deaths have occurred. In Sierra Leone (above) burial teams abandoned the bodies of victims of the disease when they went on strike earlier this month, as people gather round a suspected victim

Volunteers working in west Africa have been wearing special protective clothing to treat patients in a bid to stop Ebola spreading 

Medics will take their temperatures twice a day and anyone who shows signs of Ebola will be flown to a British treatment clinic in Kerry Town.

Captain Eagles said: 'The initial anxiety of the ship's company and families has now been replaced by pride in what is a very good mission as a part of the wider UK mission to save lives in Sierra Leone and contribute to the safety of the UK.

The ship is part of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), part of the Royal Navy

It is classed as naval/naval auxiliary vessel 

The ship is 175.1 m (574ft 6ins) long

It has a speed of 18 knots (33 km/h) 

RFA Argus has a casualty unit and 100 beds

A total of 380 personnel, including 80 medics and 80 marines are on board 

3 Merlin helicopters, air crew and engineers will travel with the ship 

Gross tonnage: 26421t

'The four building blocks to keep our people safe are the education, the training, the supervision and the leadership. 

'I am confident that we have those pillars in place.'

The WHO said the number of Ebola cases in West Africa could exceed 9,000 this week. 

Heathrow airport also started screening passengers arriving from the worst hit countries for signs of the disease and more British airports are due to do the same.

Speaking at an Asia-Europe summit in Milan, David Cameron said: 'This is the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation.

'I think it's time for other countries to look at their responsibilities and their resources and act in a similar way to what Britain is doing in Sierra Leone, America's doing in Liberia and France is doing in Guinea.

'Other countries now need to step forward with resources and action because taking action at source in west Africa, that is the best way to protect all of us here in Europe.'

Britain is taking the international lead role in tackling Ebola in Sierra Leone due to its historic links. Sierra Leone gained independence from Britain in 1961.

Captain Eagles said personnel on the ship will be subject to stringent testing before they can re-board to prevent spread of Ebola 

Prime Minister David Cameron spoke at the Asia-Europe summit  when he said countries need to do much more to tackle Ebola and help stop the spread of the deadly disease, which has killed more than 4,000 people mostly in west Africa 

 But Britain's International Development Secretary Justine Greening said other nations needed to pull their weight in the region.

'It is simply not going to be a tenable approach to simply leave the UK to work with Sierra Leone, the US with Liberia and France with Guinea and for no other countries to get involved,' she told BBC radio.

'The international community now needs to wake up to this crisis and start putting resources in.' 

A British army medical team arrived in Sierra Leone on Thursday to work at a British-supported treatment centre.

Also this week Heathrow airport started screening arrivals from the worst-affected region for the deadly disease. This was due to be launched at London Gatwick by the end of this week and will be extended to Manchester and Birmingham airports.

The ship has been loaded with materials to build medical units as well as life saving supplies and will stop off at Gibraltar to collect more

Earlier this week Lt Susan Jeffreys checked medical equipment in the ship's on board hospital ahead of its departure for Sierra Leone

As the RFA Argus set off for Sierra Leone David Cameron said countries must do more to tackle the Ebola pandemic in west Africa

WHO assistant director-general Dr Bruce Aylward previously said that if the world's response to the Ebola crisis isn't stepped up within 60 days, 'a lot more people will die' and health workers will be stretched even further.

Ebola spreads through close contact with a sufferer's bodily fluids, such as blood, sweat, vomit, faeces, urine, saliva or semen. It can be incubated for 21 days and symptoms include a fever, flu-like body aches and abdominal pain, and then vomiting and diarrhoea.

William Pooley, 29, is the only British person known so far to be diagnosed with Ebola. Mr Pooley, a nurse, caught the deadly disease while working in a hospital in Sierra Leone.

He was flown back to the UK by the RAF and treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London inside a specially designed polythene 'patient isolator' tent, tended by dozens of staff in the tailor made unit. 

He recovered from the disease and has since said he plans to return to the country to help other patients.
