Queens Park Rangers will be without Sandro until after Christmas as the midfielder suffered yet another injury setback.

The former Tottenham man, who has played just two full games for Harry Redknapp’s side, has picked up a knee problem.

It serves as a bitter blow to Redknapp, who was only talking up the fact he was managing to get his best players back from various lay-offs just a fortnight ago.

Queens Park Rangers will be without Brazilian midfieler Sandro until after Christmas 

Sandro was one of a number of new faces at Loftus Road over the summer.

Peter Florida, QPR's Head of Medical services, said: ‘He has suffered damage to his medial ligaments. It is totally unrelated to his previous ACL injury.

‘Unfortunately, he will now be unavailable for selection until after Christmas.’
