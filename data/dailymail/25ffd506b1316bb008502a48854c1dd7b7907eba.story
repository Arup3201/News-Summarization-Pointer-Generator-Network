It took a while but spring did finally burst in to remind us of what we'd been missing all those weeks.

So, hold on to that feeling if you can – because many of us could now take a step backwards weather-wise.

Forecasters warn that we are about to be blown back to a rather less balmy spell. Typically, it's just in time for the May Bank Holiday next Monday.

The bad news is that gales are 
expected to batter parts of Britain over the long weekend. Some areas 
will also be hit by hail, heavy rain and thunder.

There is some good news as 
temperatures may still hold up in double figures. And there will be some
light relief from the downturn on Bank Holiday Monday.

Yesterday, a Met Office spokesman said: 'Friday and Saturday are looking windy and showery, particularly in northern areas.

'It's still a little cold for the time of year, with temperatures a touch lower than  average for the first May Bank Holiday.

The spring sunshine is set to continue in the early part of next week but strong winds look set to return

'The weekend is looking rather unsettled. The best sign of any brightness on Monday will be in the South East.'

The Met Office predicted a largely dry Monday, with sunny spells, despite cloud building at times, with similar weather conditions lasting until Thursday.

There will be chilly breezes, which will ease later today, but he maximum temperature will be a welcome 15C.

But by Friday night, the rain clouds will gather and there is a chance that the Bank Holiday weekend will be a wash out.

While much of the UK was treated to sunny spells today, some strong winds whipped up a sandstorm.

Meteorologist Leon Brown, of the 
Weather Channel, said: 'The end of the week looks a lot more unsettled, 
unfortunately, just as we head for the bank holiday.

'There will be a cold start to the weekend with showers, some of them heavy with hail and thunder, so keep a brolly handy.'

He added that there would be ground frosts at night but things might improve for Monday.

'If you have outdoor plans for 
Monday, it looks like high pressure will build from the west to bring a 
lovely day for much of the UK, temperatures recovering again to between 
14C to 16C and feeling warmer in the strong sunshine,' said Mr Brown.

Last week, the mercury topped 22.5C 
and Britain was hotter than parts of North Africa. But heavy rain soon 
moved in across the South East on Friday.

Temperatures are expected to remain reasonably high early this week but it will be unsettled until after the holiday weekend.

With the weather still topsy-turvy, 
the odds of snow falling in any British city in the first May bank 
holiday dropped from 10/1 to 2/1.

According to the BBC Weather's Met 
Office team: 'April is set to end on a rather cool note. Showers are 
expected to sweep south-east across most of the UK at times.

'The showers are likely to turn fairly heavy, with thunder and hail always a possibility.

'There's also a risk of some sleet 
and snow for the higher ground of Scotland, Northern Ireland and 
northern England through the week.'
