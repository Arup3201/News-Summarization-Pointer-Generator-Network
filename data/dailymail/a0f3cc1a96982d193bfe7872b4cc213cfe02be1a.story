If Darth Vader did fast food, it might look something like this.

Burger King Japan’s burger offerings really have turned to the dark side, with the fast food chain now offering a black-bunned burger that comes with black cheese.

The chain’s customers first tucked into black burgers back in 2012, when the Premium Kuro Burger (kuro means ‘black’) was introduced. And they proved very popular.

Innovative: From September 19 Burger King in Japan will sell burgers that feature black cheese, made from charcoal bamboo

Its bun was coloured with bamboo charcoal and squid ink was mixed into the ketchup.

In 2013 the Kuro Ninja went on sale, which was identical to the Kuro, with the addition of a slice of bacon.

Now Burger King, from September 19, will sell two more black burgers - the Kuro Pearl priced at 480 yen (£2.80) and the Kuro Diamond at (£4.00).

These both feature black cheese - made with bamboo charcoal - black-pepper burger, onion and garlic sauce with squid ink and the eye-catching black bun.

Healthier option: The Kuro Diamond (pictured) comes with a bit of colour, thanks to the salad

The Diamond comes with a bit of non-blackened salad.

Burger King is by no means the first fast food chain to darken its products.

McDonald’s in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong sell black bun burgers, containing a beef patty topped with onion and black pepper sauce.
