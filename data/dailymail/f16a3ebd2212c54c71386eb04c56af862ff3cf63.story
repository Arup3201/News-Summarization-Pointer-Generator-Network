A young man who suffered a stroke claims he is being denied life-saving surgery to close a hole in his heart, despite the NHS funding weight loss operations.

Scott Elliott has criticised the health service, claiming 'it would be fine if I needed a gastric band'.

The 28-year-old suffered a stroke while working as an HGV mechanic.

Spotting the signs, his wife Helen rushed him to hospital in time for medics to save his life.

Mr Elliott, who has run the London Marathon and played football five times a week, was shocked when doctors told him he had been born with a hole in his heart.

Scott and Helen Elliott are desperate for him to have a procedure to close a hole in his heart after he suffered a stroke. But the 28-year-old has been denied surgery on the NHS and must pay for the operation privately

But he is now embroiled in a battle with hospital bosses to have the hole closed - procedure he believes would drastically reduce the chance of him suffering a second stroke.

But hospital bosses say the NHS does not currently 'routinely commission' the operation.

Mr Elliott’s own consultants have 
written asking them to give the go-ahead but the NHS does not believe the 
benefits of the operation justify the costs.

Instead, Mr Elliott must take a daily cocktail of pills for the rest of his life to reduce the chances of blood clots.

He fears it is only a matter of time before he suffers another stroke.

Now after battling NHS red tape for more than two years, the couple have decided the best option is to raise the £10,000 needed to fund the operation privately.

Mr Elliott said: 'It is like walking round having a ton of bricks over my head, waiting for them to fall and kill me. I want to move on with my life but I can’t until I have this operation.

'I don’t smoke, I eat healthily, I have worked all my life and paid my taxes but when I needed the NHS, it was not there for me.

'What makes it harder to take is when I see people getting boob jobs on the NHS and it seems that I would be fine if I needed a gastric band if I had eaten too much.

'How on earth do they get approval for these things which seem to reward unhealthy lifestyles - what do I have to do to get my operation? 'I did not ask for this problem.'

A series of expert cardiologists have told Mr Elliott, who now works for a railway company, there is a 'desperate' need for the operation known as a Patent Foramen Ovale Closure which would close the flap-like opening in his heart.

If the flap remains open it could allow a blood clot to travel from one part of his body to the brain causing another stroke.

In March 2012 Mr Elliott was rushed to hospital having suffered a stroke. There, doctors revealed he had been born with a hole in his heart. He says experts have told him the operation, which the NHS says it does not currently 'routinely commission', would reduce his risk of suffering a second stroke

Mr Elliott suffered his stroke in March 2012 and has been to more than 50 hospital appointments since then.

The process of 'being pushed from 
pillar to post' during the past two-and-a-half years has at times left 
the couple at their wits’ end.

Mr Elliott’s speech can sometimes be slurred which has also knocked his confidence.

He
 believes it was only thanks to being young and healthy that the impact 
of the stroke was not more severe, as he did not suffer any paralysis.

Trying to raise the money for the operation has also been challenging for the couple.

All people are born with flap-like openings in their hearts. But, for most, the opening closes by itself shortly after birth.

In some people, an open flap remains between the two upper chambers of 
the heart (the left and right atria). This opening can allow a blood 
clot from one part of the body to travel through the flap and up to the 
brain, causing a stroke.

Currently, there are two main treatment methods for PFO - medicines or 
PFO closure, which can include open-heart surgery or a newer procedure 
that closes the flap without major surgery.

Medications don’t treat the actual PFO, but they can control clotting 
factors in the blood so stroke-causing blood clots are less likely to 
form in the first place.

In recent years, a new approach has been developed, enabling doctors to 
seal the PFO without major surgery.

An implanted closure device, which 
can resemble a tiny two-ended umbrella, is delivered to the PFO using a 
small tube threaded to the heart from a vein in the thigh. The implant 
is inserted through the flap and released from the tube.

He said: 'I feel embarrassed asking people for money. I am quite a 
proud man and I have "put in" throughout my life, so it’s a hard thing to
 do.

'We could sell the house, but we have worked hard to get this and it’s our home and our place where we have settled.

'If
 I have the operation on the NHS I would then be able to work, without 
question, for another 45 years which would be 45 years of my National 
Insurance and taxes going into the pot.

'But if I was to be struck down 
with another stroke, that could be me taking out of the NHS for the rest
 of my life.

'The costs of the operation would be a drop in the ocean for the NHS.'

Mr Elliott had to give up his HGV 
driving licence as a result of the stroke. This also dashed his dreams 
of becoming a pilot as regulations mean he will not be able to fly.

He has raised his concerns with Colchester MP Bob Russell who has pushed the Health Secretary for answers.

Mrs Elliott, 32, a photographer, said: 'We have been fighting for two-and-a-half years but we have not got anywhere.

'We have always worked so hard and given back yet when we needed the NHS, we have been pushed around from pillar to post.

'And then it’s so frustrating when we see the decisions by the NHS to fund things like gastric band operations.'

A spokesperson for NHS England said: 'We understand how difficult this is and sympathise with the patient who may feel they could benefit from this procedure.

'There is more evidence needed to show that Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) is of sufficient benefit to patients and consequently NHS England’s policy is that it should not be routinely commissioned.

'It is likely that PFO will be commissioned at a limited number of centres during the autumn through its £16.9million ‘Commissioning Through Evaluation’ programme.

'This trials treatments which clinicians have identified as showing significant promise as a potential treatment option.

'Commissioning Through Evaluation is aimed at gathering evidence about services which are not currently routinely funded by the NHS as the existing evidence base does not yet demonstrate sufficient clinical and cost-effectiveness for its routine use.'

Josie Cunningham from Leeds, had a boob job on the NHS to boost her confidence

The number of breast enlargements has soared by 145 per cent in a decade to 10,504 – costing up to £52.5million.

Many of these will be reconstructions following cancer treatment, but the increase far outstrips any rise in breast cancer diagnoses.

In one case, Josie Cunningham had an enlargement after saying her 32A chest was ruining her life.

The former prostitute and wannabe glamour model provoked outrage when it emerged she had a £4,800 state-funded boob job at the same NHS Trust that refused to pay for surgery to allow a disabled two-year-old to walk.

She later claimed her breasts, which were boosted from a 32A to a 36D, were 'so big' she found them embarrassing, and called on the NHS to pay for a reduction.

And barman Sam Barton, 22, of Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands, was given a nose job by the NHS – and boasted how easy it was to get the £5,000 procedure.

He now says he expects the taxpayer to foot the bill for further surgery, including another nose job, as well as having his ears pinned back and jaw reshaped.

The obesity epidemic has also had an effect on the surgery bill, with the number of liposuction operations in 2012/13 standing at 1,926 – up 40 per cent in ten years.

The cost in the most recent year will have been up to £9.6million, according to NHS Choices which says the operation costs between £1,500 and £5,000.

There has also been a 39 per cent rise in the number undergoing eyelid surgery to 4,966 – costing up to £19.9million. This operation is supposed to be carried out to treat affected vision.

And 8,537 nose jobs were carried out in 2013/14 – up 4 per cent and costing £34.1million.

Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ 
Alliance, said: ‘It’s ludicrous the NHS pays for procedures that are not
 based on strict medical needs.’

The figures were compiled by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, following a request from the Daily Mail.

It also showed that up to £20.3million was spent on breast reduction operations, £5.8million on tummy tucks and £5.7million on ear pinning. However, these totals have declined over the past decade.

Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told a Westminster lunch: ‘We should not be doing cosmetic work on the NHS.’

Roger Goss, of pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘There are two types of cosmetic surgery – the type that happens after illness and the sort where someone is just trying to look better.

'We agree with the Secretary of State that this kind of thing is no longer affordable on the NHS. In fact, it is amazing it was ever considered affordable at all.’
