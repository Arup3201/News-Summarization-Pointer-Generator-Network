An Afghanistan veteran confronted a man he believed to be a ‘fake’ solider at a Pennsylvania shopping mall on Black Friday and accused him of being a phony after he watched him parade around wearing military honors that he couldn't possibly have been awarded. 

Ryan Berk, a Purple Heart recipient, spotted the man - who was dressed in camouflage fatigues and who identified himself as Sean Yetman - at the Oxford Valley Mall and was immediately suspicious of his mismatched uniform. 

Along with an American flag patch in the wrong spot, Berk noticed that Yetman was wearing three Combat Infantryman Badges (CIBs) on his shoulder – an extremely rare honor.

The pudgy man in uniform, who  identified himself in the video as Sean Yetman, claimed he had 'literally just got home from Fort Lewis' and was shopping with his Sergeant Major

Using his cell phone to record their conversation, Berk approached the man and quizzed him about his experiences as a soldier.

When asked where he had received his CIBs, the man first answered that he got all three in Afghanistan - an impossibility since only one is given per campaign.

The conversation got more heated as Berk then called the man, who wore a name ribbon identifying himself as ‘Yetman' and who had introduced himself as 'Sean', a phony and accused him of impersonating a soldier.

Yetman claimed he had 'literally just got home from Fort Lewis' and was shopping with his Sergeant Major - who he offered to introduce Berk to.

When the man denied lying about his military service, Berk lost his cool. 

'Here it is, stolen valor at its finest,' he shouted, as Yetman began to walk away. 'Why don’t you just admit you’re a phony?'

Ryan Berk, a Afghanistan vet and Purple Heart recipient, was shopping at the mall with his girlfriend and her son when he spotted the 'fake' officer and decided to approach him 

‘I noticed his combat infantryman's badge, he had two stars above it, which would indicate that he served in three different wars which is almost physically impossible for his age,’ said Berk. 

There is no U.S. Army Ranger with three CIBs named Yetman listed on any official record.

Speaking to Fox on Tuesday, Berk said that while the man had initially provided some answers that could have been correct, his story quickly unraveled when he claimed to have received his three CIBs from service in Afghanistan.

'I served in Afghanistan and have several friend who were seriously wounded and a couple who were killed in action who wore that same uniform and to see someone try and claim that type of sacrifice really irked me,’ said Berk.

He also said his grandfather had served in World War 2 and it was ‘just wrong’ that this man was tainting that legacy by wearing the uniform.

‘No one is going to question a guy in uniform, unless they already wear the uniform,’ Berk, who earned a Purple Heart after he was wounded by shrapnel in 2010 while fighting in Afghanistan, told The Morning Call.

Berk’s video of the confrontation was uploaded to the Stolen Valor YouTube account, where it has since been viewed over two million times.

On Monday, U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Bucks) asked the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia to determine if there was evidence of a federal crime against Sean Yetman

The account belongs to Guardian of Valor, a network of active and veteran soldiers who seek to expose people who falsely claim military service and/or claim unauthorized medals or tabs. 

Anthony Anderson, a vet who runs the Guardian of Valor website told Philly.com that fake soldiers are becoming increasingly common. 

Most are seeking attention and recognition, while others use the uniform to receive exclusive military discounts at stores and restaurants. 

Under the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, it is illegal for an individual to fraudulently portray him or herself as a recipient of any of several specified military decorations or medals with the intent to obtain money, property or other ‘tangible benefit.’

It was unknown if the uniformed man received any special treatment from any store at the mall, but on Monday, U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Bucks) asked the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia to determine if there was evidence of a federal crime against 'Yetman'

Berk has no doubts that the man he confronted was not a ranger.

'He's impersonating in the uniform people died for,' Berk added. 'He was wearing awards that I earned and he didn't.'
