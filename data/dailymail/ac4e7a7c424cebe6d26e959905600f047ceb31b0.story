Just a stone's throw from Disney's Magic Kingdom, with five bedrooms, 13 acres of land and its own swimming pool, this 1920s waterside stucco mansion would be the ideal holiday home for anyone with a family.

But the property has gained a degree of notoriety among its Florida neighbours - it once belonged to the family with the world's most infamous surname - the Bin Ladens.

Khalil Bin Laden, brother of Al Qaeda mastermind Osama and one of 50 plus siblings of the terror chief, bought the palatial mansion for his wife back in 1980.

And it is even thought that Osama himself may have stayed at the property while visiting his brother.

Needs some work: The Florida mansion once owned by Khalil Bin Laden, brother of terror chief Osama Bin Laden, pictured looking dilapidated and with overgrown grass

Run down: Khalil Bin Laden's home is pictured in the years following 9/11 when the family fled the US through fears of reprisals

Impressive: The spacious dining room of the mansion looks more like an ancient chapel than part of a family home

Dirty: The pool and a jacuzzi at the property, in Oakland, Florida, are shown covered in algae and dirt as the property fell into disrepair

The Mediterranean-style mansion, complete with a red tiled roof, in the quiet town of Oakland, some 20 miles away from Orlando, was bought by Khalil for $1.6million.

Sitting on the shores of idyllic Johns Lake, the Bin Laden children are once said to have played in the home's vast grounds.

With sweeping tiled floors, beautiful arched doorways and an ostentatious marble bath tub, the Bin Laden's would have enjoyed a peaceful life of luxury.

One of the home's most impressive rooms is a giant dining room with a fireplace at one end which resembles something more akin to a European chapel than a family home.

Holiday home: Khalil Bin Laden's old home is situated just a few miles north of Disney's Magic Kingdom

Family kitchen: Much of the home, including the kitchen area (pictured), is decked out in beautiful stone, marble or wooden flooring

Ostentatious: The home boasts a beautiful marble bath tub and features stunning curved archways between rooms

Its location even leads you to wonder if its one time owners had a season ticket to nearby Disneyland.

But the family fled the US after the 9/11 attacks fearing reprisals because of their immediate link to the mastermind behind the deadly atrocity.

The property, which also boasts stables and four detached garages, was boarded up and fell into disrepair after the family left.

Haunting pictures of the dilapidated property, taken when estate agents were struggling to sell it because of it's links to the infamous family, have been posted on Florida's Forgotten Past website.

It was once described by Forbes magazine as one of the 'creepiest abandoned mansions' in the US but is now partially occupied by a paralegal and part rented out as a wedding venue.

Expensive: The house, built in 1928, was originally bought by Khalil Bin Laden for $1.6million

For hire: Part of the building is now said to be available for rent as a wedding venue

Infamous relative: The house struggled to sell in the years after Khalil, left, fled the US because of his family ties to Al Qaeda mastermind Osama Bin Laden, right
