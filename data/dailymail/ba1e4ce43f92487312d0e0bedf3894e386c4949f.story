Police are searching for an Ohio State University football player who went missing after going out for a walk.

Defensive tackle Kosta Karageorge told his roommate in Columbus that he was leaving for a late stroll on Tuesday and has not been seen since.

The former wrestler who is now a walk-on for the Buckeyes failed to turn up to his team's practice today ahead of their game against Michigan on Saturday. He is one of 24 seniors who will be recognized as part of their final home game. 

Defensive tackle Kosta Karageorge, 22,  told his roommate in Columbus that he was leaving for a late stroll on Tuesday and has not been seen since.

The 22-year-old's sister Sophia told The Columbus Dispatch there had been some 'extenuating circumstances' that may have caused him to be upset. 

Karageorge's family are also concerned that he may be feeling the side-effects of a number of sports-related concussions, the latest of which he suffered last month. 

'He never misses practice,' Sophia said. 'I've seen him go to wrestling practice with a broken foot. I've seen him sick as a dog go to practice. He's always on schedule. He always has somewhere where he checks in.

'We’re very concerned that he’s not himself and that he maybe doesn’t know what’s going on.'

Authorities traced the player's phone nearby, but were unable to retrieve it. He does not have a car on campus and he wasn't on his motorbike, leading authorities to believe he took public transport or is still on foot.

Karageorge played in one game this year, against Penn State. He was credited with one assisted tackle. 

Sophia also told the paper that he does not have his identification on him because his girlfriend has his wallet. 

The athlete is 6ft 5in, weighs 285 pounds and has a shaved head.

The athlete was a wrestler for the university before he started as a walk-on defensive tackle. He has played one game this season against Penn State
