Lionel Messi may have just taken his career goals tally to an incredible 401, but Barcelona coach Luis Enrique claims there is more to his game than simply scoring.

The Argentinian phenomenon netted twice during the Catalan's 6-0 thrashing of Granada on Saturday, but his manager has been equally impressed by his dedication to defending. 

‘He’s an impressive player on every level because he can score and he can pass,' said Enrique.

‘He’s also a very determined player, and I think he’s also the No. 1 in terms of defending and dropping back.

‘Even though people talk much less about that part of his game, he’s also very good at it.’

Barcelona have started the season with six wins from seven games in all competitions without conceding a goal ahead of their Champions League clash with Paris Saint Germain on Tuesday.

While Messi's five league goals are below his usual high standards, especially when arch rival Cristiano Ronaldo has already managed 12 for Real Madrid this season, teammate Jeremy Mathieu says that the 26-year-old has been having more of an impact on games.

‘Messi’s a bit different this season because he’s scoring less but is more influential in the game,' said the French defender.

‘Everyone knows about his qualities and he’s very important for us. He can create something out of nothing and win the match.’

While Messi has been struggling to get on the scoresheet, his forward partner Neymar appears to have adapted to life at the world's most prestigious club with six goals to his name, including a hat-trick against Granada.

‘They’re combining well together. But it’s important that the whole team combines well, not just two players,' added Mathieu.
