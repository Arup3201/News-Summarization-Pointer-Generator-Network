Former Manchester United star Gary Neville has clashed with his old club over plans to build a hotel with a rooftop pitch.

The England coach already has planning permission for a 139-bed hotel and supporters' club in the shadow of Old Trafford, but has now submitted amendments which include the 16m by 12m artificial area.

Trafford planning committee will meet on Thursday to consider the plans for the rooftop area, which would have a retractable canopy, bar and TVs and raise the height of the 10-storey building 1.9m higher than previous drawings.

Manchester United have already objected to Neville's development, on the grounds that it would obstruct views of their stadium’s east stand.

In a report to the council, the club said: 'The tall landmark building would obstruct key views towards the stadium’s east stand.

'The east stand is the principle elevation and forms a highly visible focal point on approach to the stadium and any development proposal that fails to acknowledge the stand’s significance as a consequence of inappropriate scale and massing should not therefore be accepted.'

At odds: The former Manchester United player has clashed with the club over the hotel development

In May Manchester United lodged a stinging five-page objection letter against the hotel, leisure and retail complex. They claimed the development has insufficient parking and say that even if those issues were resolved, ‘MUFC shall continue to oppose and object to the proposed scheme due to its impact on the Old Trafford landscape, highway safety and the club’s holistic vision for the continuing enhancement of the area surrounding the stadium’.

Manchester United have refused to comment on plans for the artificial pitch. A new planning application has also been submitted for two giant LED advertising screens on the side of the hotel.

The Sky Sports pundit and Mail on Sunday 
columnist is no stranger to planning battles, having recently secured 
permission for a 'Teletubby' eco-home in rural Lancashire.

Proposals to include a 100-foot wind turbine had to be dropped, but developers came up with even 'greener' ways to power Neville's house - which will be the first carbon-neutral house in Bolton and in the North West.

It will include a ground source heat pump, sustainable rainwater harvesting and solar panels.

Last month, the former United captain spoke at a conference in Manchester about his involvement in the hotel industry.

He said: 'It’s like when I made my 
debut for Manchester United - I don’t know what’s going to happen. But 
in the same way - if you’ve got good people around you, you feel like 
you can succeed.'

'I’m 
excited because it will be my first foray into the world of hotels. I’m 
really looking forward to it. I want to deliver and achieve something.'

Neville said he did not want to comment on the revised plans.
