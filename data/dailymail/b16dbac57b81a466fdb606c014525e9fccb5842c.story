If Russians arrive in Brisbane armed with guns they will be 'dealt with', Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart has warned. 

His strong statement came after police revealed they have not received a request from any foreign security services to carry guns in Australia just 48 hours before the G20 leader's meeting kicks off.

Mr Stewart told the Courier Mail if Russian President Vladimir Putin's men arrive with weapons: 'They will be dealt with under the laws of this state. We’ve made that very clear, as has the Federal Government.'

Police have received no requests from any nations to bring guns into Queensland 

The Russian delegation will be met at Brisbane airport but Mr Stewart did not go as far as to say the would be arrested if caught with guns. 

On Thursday, Deputy Police Commissioner Ross Barnett said authorities have yet to receive a request from the typically armed to the teeth US Secret Service that guards President Barack Obama or any guards Mr Putin or another world leader may hope to bring.

Mr Barnett said: 'At the moment no formal application has been made to the commissioner for any foreign service personnel to carry firearms in Queensland.'

Police showed off a 'flotilla' of more than a dozen security boats on the Brisbane River on Thursday morning

 Hundreds of police are monitoring, from the water, air, and on the ground

But that may change over the next 'twelve, twenty-four, forty-eight hours', he told reporters, adding that the requests could be expedited.

He said requests had to be made to the Federal government who forward them on to the police commissioner, who has the 'final say' on who carries weapons in the state.

The expected size of President Obama's entourage is not yet clear but he is typically accompanied overseas by a small army of Secret Service personnel and a considerable motorcade.

Russian leader Vladimir Putin may not have applied to bring guns into the country yet but he has a fleet of four vessels currently off the Queensland coast, in what some interpreted as a 'shipfront' to Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

Police showed off a 'flotilla' of more than a dozen security boats on the Brisbane River this morning, whole streets have been blocked off in the Southbank area, helicopters are regularly buzzing overhead and hundreds of police are roaming the city.

Local council workers are scrambling to clean up the area between Brisbane and the University of Queensland to show off the city's 'best face' to President Obama.
