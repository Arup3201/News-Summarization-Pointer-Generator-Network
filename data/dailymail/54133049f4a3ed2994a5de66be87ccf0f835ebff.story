It could be mistake for an untidy haystack - but this mammoth pile of twigs and leaves was yesterday revealed as being one of the biggest birds' nests ever seen in Britain.

The enormous 10ft wide, 6ft high and 2ft deep nest was discovered in the
ceiling of a village church tower after parishioners heard bird song 
during services.

Tiny jackdaws are thought to have taken up to four years to build the giant structure, which was found in the ceiling of St Margaret's Church, Moreton Say, near Market Drayton, in Shropshire.

It's not pretty but it's home: Jackdaws have built one of Britain's biggest ever birds nests in the roof of St Margaret's Church, Moreton Say, near Market Drayton, in Shropshire

Reverend Michael Last (pictured) is concerned the huge bird's nest could pose a fire risk to the church

A church warden who went to investigate discovered that a family of 
jackdaws had squeezed in through a tiny hole left in the wall in order 
to build the nest.

Plans are now underway to remove the nest, due to fears about the fire risk it poses.

Reverend Michael Last said: "We first discovered it in the spring.

Jackdaws like to roost and nest in
loose colonies above buildings, and are known to block chimneys with
their piles of twigs.

'When we were having evening services, you could hear birds singing in the roof.

'They have gone in through a very small opening where a grill had broken.'

The nest will now be removed after it was decided it posed a fire hazard to the centuries-old parish church.

Because of its size, the nest will have to be dragged across the floor of the tower before being dropped 20ft on to the floor below.

'The only way we can get it out is take it through the roof and out the tower,' said Revd Last.

'I
am not trying to un-home them but if they brought in a lit cigarette 
there would be a huge fire because they have basically built a large 
bonfire - and you don't know what else they have brought in.'

Parishioner
James Smith, 47, said he thought the nest looked more like it should 
house a prehistoric beast than a family of jackdaws.

He said: 'It looks like something out of Jurassic Park - like there should be a pterodactyl living in it.

'It's
absolutely massive, it's mind-boggling to think that just a few little 
birds built it up with twigs and other bits of rubbish.'

St Margaret's Church in Moreton Saye where the nest was found

Jackdaws build nests in cavities in trees, cliffs and buildings - and even household chimneys.

They
make nests from hair, wool, rags, bark, soil, dead grass and sticks and
they are known for picking up or stealing shiny objects to hoard.

Fen
Gerry, a spokesperson for the RSPB, said: 'It really is an amazing 
nest. Jackdaws are known for building intricate nests and this is 
certainly the biggest one I have ever seen in my life.

'It is very unusual to see them this large.'

John
Hughes, development manager at the Shropshire Wildlife Trust, added: 'Jackdaws build nests on top of nests, they will build to fit wherever 
they are, but the case at Moreton Say certainly sounds exceptional.'

'It is believed the biggest jackdaw nest ever seen in Britain was 10ft high and built in a bell tower at Eton College in 1842.'
