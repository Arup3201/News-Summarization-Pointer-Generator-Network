'Talented': Valerie Graves ran her own craft studio and gallery called Fin Taw at the Harestanes Countryside Visitor Centre in Roxburghshire

Devastated relatives of a grandmother found murdered at the £1.6million home she was house-sitting yesterday paid tribute to the ‘free spirited’ artist who had recently moved from Scotland to be closer to her family.

Valerie Graves’s family said in a statement that her murder had been a ‘complete shock’ after they had all enjoyed Christmas together at the house in a village which has featured in ITV crime drama Midsomer Murders.

Meanwhile it is thought that 55-year-old Miss Graves’s sister Janet, 60, her architect partner Nigel Acres, 59, and elderly mother Eileen, who were believed to be in the property when her body was found on Monday morning, have had their phones confiscated by detectives.

A 14ft motor boat and a silver Lexus 4x4 with personalised number plates have also been removed from the property which has its own pool house and a jetty.

And forensics officers yesterday searched a creek at the back of the house in Bosham, West Sussex.

As they appealed for anyone with information to come forward, Miss Graves’s family said in a statement: ‘Val was a free spirit who enjoyed her life and was a talented artist, about to embark on a new path involving ceramics. She was an eternal student, who was always hungry for a new challenge.

‘She had recently moved back to Sussex from Scotland to be closer to her family and we were lucky enough to spend a family Christmas together.’

Ernie Mears, 80, who is a close friend of Miss Graves’s mother, enjoyed a meal with her family at the home they were house sitting on Boxing Day.

He said: ‘I’ve been very worried about Valerie’s mum Eileen as I haven’t been able to get hold of her since this happened to find out if she is OK.

‘I eventually spoke to Nigel on New Year’s Day. He told me the detectives had taken their mobiles and things away.

‘This has all been terribly upsetting for them.’

Mr Mears, a retired builder, said 
police took fingerprints and DNA samples from him as part of the 
elimination process as they search for clues pointing to Miss Graves’s 
killer.

He added that the 
Christmas celebration ‘was not as happy as normal’ when he joined Miss 
Graves’s family last week, because she and her two grown up children, 
Jemima and Tim, were not there.

He
 said: ‘Whether she had taken them back to London or to other relatives I
 do not know. It was not one of the happiest days, like Christmas Day 
last year. We usually play bingo and Jan would have got prizes in – it 
was festive. This year, being Boxing Day, there just wasn’t the same 
atmosphere.’

Questioned: Roy Wood - the father Miss Graves' two grown-up children - was questioned for several hours on New Year's Day but not arrested

Meanwhile naked pictures have appeared on a sex website purporting to show the home’s owner, 66-year-old millionaire entrepreneur  and company director Malcolm Chamberlain.

The profile beneath them, which the married father of two says was not posted by him, describes him as ‘VERY wealthy’ and says he is interested in ‘casual sex, discreet relationships and threesomes’.  Paul Dixon, a lawyer representing Mr Chamberlain who is currently on holiday with his wife Caroline, 63, and their children, said: ‘He doesn’t know who put the profile and pictures on the website, but it was not him. It is something he is planning on looking into when he gets back.’

Miss Graves was discovered with severe head and facial injuries.

Police say they are keeping an open mind on the circumstances of her death and have not ruled out the possibility of a break in. Former rock band roadie Roy Wood – the father Miss Graves’ two grown-up children – was questioned for several hours on New Year’s Day but not arrested or cautioned.

The 65-year-old yesterday declined to comment at his home in Brighton.

Miss Graves, who had a degree in textiles, ran her own craft studio and gallery called Fin Taw at the Harestanes Countryside Visitor Centre in Roxburghshire.
