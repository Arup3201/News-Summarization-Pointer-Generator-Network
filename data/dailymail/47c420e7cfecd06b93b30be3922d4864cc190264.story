The economy may be just about on the road to recovery, but it will take a little more than that before most of us can afford just one night in this exclusive holiday retreat in the Caribbean.

Billed as 'one of the world's most luxurious holiday resorts for the rich and famous,' it costs a staggering £40,000 a night for the entire 10-suite island.

With the average wage in the UK standing at £26,200, and a week on Calivigny island totalling more than £280,000, this resort is something most folk can only dream of.

Even Sir Richard Branson's Necker Island is more within most people's financial reach. Relatively. The Virgin boss's Caribbean island is a bargain £26,600 a night if you rent the whole atoll, or just £17,100 a week if you book a villa.

Exclusivity: Only the rich and famous will ever step foot on this stunning island, close to Grenada, in the Caribbean, which has a price tag of more than £40,000 a night

So what can the rich and famous expect for their dollar at the exclusive Calivigny retreat? Nestled in the heart of the Caribbean, the 81-acre private island, located just off of Grenada, boasts postcard views - and a price to match.

Surrounded by serene tropical seas and golden sandy beaches, the island caters for billionaire moguls and 20 friends - who will each have their own extravagant secluded villa.

The opulent French Colonial design oozes throughout each building and alongside the vast 140,000 square feet of living space are various formal and casual dining areas, full hair and beauty salon, fully staffed five-star kitchen, gym and boathouse that comes with its own SUBMARINE.

Every inch of the grand residence is covered with marble flooring, vaulted Balinese style ceilings, French windows and doors, swirling stair cases with ornate wrought iron banisters, rich vibrant Persian carpets, plush leather couches, art deco furnishings and design by Oscar de la Renta and Richard Frinier.

Decadence: Each of the ten bedroom suites is furnished with a king size bed, sitting area, wet bar, grand carved wooden wardrobes, writing desks and dining tables

But if those guests lucky enough to be invited on the holiday of a lifetime do not enjoy the hosts' company they can choose from one of six private beaches to soak up the sun on.

The idyllic island has become one of the most sought-after resorts on the planet by wealthy travellers seeking the best that money can buy.

A spokesman for high-end travel agents LaCure said: 'Calivigny Island is a spectacular one of a kind private island retreat.

'Boasting six private white sand beaches, two directly in front of the beach house, opportunity flourishes for hidden pleasures, quiet solitude and good old fashioned beach fun on this stunning island.

Grand entrance: Guests receive a private boat or aeroplane to transport  them to and from the hotel. When they arrive they are greeted by this entrance walkway

Luxury: One of the living rooms within the hotel boasts a decadent large golden ceiling rose, grand piano, 6ft vases and Persian rugs

Plush interior: Each suite is uniquely designed, with expensive furniture and decor, and all command breathtaking views of the coast

'It truly is something special that has given those lucky enough to experience it memories of a lifetime.'

Each of the ten bedroom suites is furnished with a king size bed, sitting area, wet bar, grand carved wooden wardrobes, writing desks and dining tables.

Every suite has a unique design, with a sunken Jacuzzi or a loft- style bedroom gallery, every guest suite is richly appointed, spacious, and comfortable with exquisitely appointed en-suite bathrooms, private entrances and views of the island and ocean beyond.

Ultimate relaxation: With not a soul to disturb them, guests can wind away the hours (at a cost of £1,666 per hour) on one of the secluded beach sun loungers, listening to the waves and the wind in the trees

Serene: It will be easy to escape the hum drum of every day life while reclining on this private beach, toes in the pristine turquoise water - one of six beaches on the island

Guests can also enjoy a number of 
optional activities, services and amenities available upon request, such
 as a 173 ft Atmosphere Perini Navisailing Yacht, musicians and 
entertainers, fireworks displays, massage therapy services and more.

To maintain the gorgeous island, up to 20 members of staff work around the clock catering for guests' every needs.

And
 when the unfortunate time of packing up and heading back to the mansion
 arrives, there is private boat and aeroplane transport available to 
courier people back home.
