More than a dozen people were arrested Saturday protesting the acquittal of police officers accused of beating a homeless man to death.

Hundreds of people took to the streets in Fullerton, California to protest the not guilty verdict but things took a turn for the worse after a local television crew was assaulted - that's when police busted up the demonstration by arresting 13 people.

Fullerton Police, the target of the protests, moved in donning riot gear and ordered the crowd to disperse. Those who didn't were taken away by force.

Angry: People protesting in Fullerton feel the police aren't innocent in the homeless man's death

Eventually dispersed: The protest was broken up after demonstrators turned violent - 13 people were taken away in hand cuffs

The 10 people who failed to comply were arrested, as well as the woman who assaulted the camera crew and two others for scrawling obscenities and anarchist graffiti on police property.

The FBI is now investigating the evidence in the case to see if any federal laws were broken, according to KTLA.

The demonstrators were incensed by the acquittals of Manuel Ramos and Jay Cicinelli, who were charged with the 2011 death of 37-year-old Kelly Thomas, a homeless man who died at a hospital five days after a violent struggle with police that was captured on videotape.

The acquittals came despite what appeared to be damning footage of the officers continuing to beat Thomas as he screamed out for his father 30 times, begged for air and apologized.

Ramos was the first officer in Orange County ever charged with murder while on duty.

Asphyxiated by police: Kelly Thomas (pictured), who was homeless and schizophrenic, died in the hospital five days after a brutal confrontation with Fullerton police in 2011. The homeless man's cause of death was listed as brain death caused by asphyxiation from the officers piling on his chest

Former Fullerton police officer Manuel Ramos was acquitted of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. Former Cpl. Jay Cicinelli was acquitted of involuntary manslaughter and excessive use of force.

Thomas, 37, had a history of run-ins with police before the July 2011 confrontation.

His father, Ron Thomas, said his son suffered from schizophrenia and didn't understand the orders from police.

Prosecutors relied on grainy surveillance video at trial to show Thomas being struck, shocked by stun guns and restrained by officers.

The 33-minute video showed six officers striking Thomas with their fists and knees, and shocking him with a Taser as he cried out for his father.

A county pathologist concluded that Thomas died, in part, from a lack of oxygen to the brain caused by injuries received during the confrontation.

Outside court, Thomas's parents condemned the verdict.

'Just horrified,' Cathy Thomas said. 'He got away with murdering my son. It's just not fair. So I guess it's legal to go out and kill now. He was so innocent. It just isn't fair at all.'

Ron Thomas said the defense 'lied ... continuously' about his son's character, such as his drug use.

'It's carte blanche for police officers everywhere to beat us, kill us' because the verdict proves 'they'll get away with it.'

Thomas was taken off life support five days after the July 5, 2011, scuffle with several officers.

A third officer is awaiting trial. Three others were not charged.

Four-term Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas tried the current case himself, a sign of its importance.

Cause for doubt? Defense attorney Michael D. Schwartz represented former Fullerton police officer Jay Cicinelli, reviews video footage prosecutors say revealed the officers used deadly force in the 2011 incident

Evidence: The surveillance video was key evidence at trial and was played repeatedly by attorneys for both sides. The 33-minute video begins shortly after Ramos pulled up in his patrol car and continues well past the end of the struggle, capturing the officers' exchanges as Thomas lies unconscious in a pool of blood and paramedics work to revive him.

Thomas' death led to days of protests in Fullerton, a Southern California college town, forced the recall of three City Council members and led the police chief to step down.

Dozens of Thomas supporters, who called themselves 'Kelly's Army,' packed the courtroom each day of the five-week trial wearing yellow ribbons and buttons bearing his image. Ron Thomas said his son suffered from schizophrenia and didn't understand the orders from police.

The 33-minute video begins shortly after Ramos pulled up in his patrol car and continues well past the end of the struggle, capturing the officers' exchanges as Thomas lies unconscious in a pool of blood and paramedics work to revive him.

The incident began when Ramos responded to a routine call about a disheveled man jiggling the handles of car doors in a busy Fullerton transit center parking lot.

The officer suspected Thomas was in possession of stolen property after his partner found mail belonging to an attorney in a backpack Thomas was carrying.

Authorities later determined the letters had been tossed out by the attorney and plucked from the garbage by Thomas.

In the surveillance footage, Ramos appears to grow angry as Thomas repeatedly evades questions about his name and doesn't comply with orders to sit with his hands on his knees.

Heavy handed? Prosecutors said the back-and-forth took a critical turn when Ramos put on Latex gloves, made two fists in Thomas' face and said, 'Now see my fists? They're getting ready to (expletive) you up'

Prosecutors said the back-and-forth 
took a critical turn when Ramos put on Latex gloves, made two fists in 
Thomas' face and said, 'Now see my fists? They're getting ready to 
(expletive) you up.' Seconds later, Thomas stood and backed away and 
ran. Ramos and his partner swatted at him with their batons then 
overtook him and repeatedly called for backup as they struggled to cuff 
him.

Rackauckas told jurors that Ramos was 
charged with murder because his verbal threat set in motion the chain of
 events that led to Thomas' death and he did nothing to stop the 
violence as six officers joined the fight. Cicinelli, who arrived 
minutes later, used the butt end of his electric stun gun to hit Thomas 
eight times in the head and face, breaking multiple bones and causing 
breathing problems that contributed to his death, prosecutors said. He 
also stunned him several times.

The coroner listed the cause of death as brain death caused by asphyxiation from the officers piling on his chest.

Defense attorneys, however, said that 
Thomas was to blame for the fight because he disobeyed a lawful order 
and then fled police who were making an arrest.

At a loss: Though Cathy Thomas (center, with supporters of her late son) tearfully admitted she'd had a restraining order against her son, she maintains he was a harmless man who was wrongfully murdered

They
 told jurors that Thomas was not a helpless, homeless mentally ill man, 
but a violent and dangerous person who had a history of drug use and was
 homeless because he had attacked members of his own family. In one of 
the most striking moments at trial, the defense put Thomas' mother and 
maternal grandfather on the witness stand.

A
 tearful Cathy Thomas told the jury she had taken out a restraining 
order against her son three years ago after he choked her for several 
minutes during an argument. The grandfather testified that Thomas had 
suddenly attacked him with a fireplace poker in 1995. Thomas pleaded 
guilty to the attack and served nine months in jail.

Only
 a handful of police officers nationwide have been charged with murder 
for actions taken while on duty and convictions in those cases are even 
more rare, said Lawrence Rosenthal, a law professor at Chapman 
University School of Law and a former federal prosecutor.

'It's not unprecedented, but it's very rare,' he said. 'There's only a handful.'

Eye for an eye? Defense attorney John D. Barnett, representing Ramos reminds jurors that the prosecution's own use of force expert testified that threatening force with a baton was a reasonable threat during the trial of Ramos and former fellow officer Jay Cincinelli in Santa Ana
