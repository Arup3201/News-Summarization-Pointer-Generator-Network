At first it appears the last thing baby Connar wants while he cries and writhes around is for a cat to come along and start playing with him.

But this hilarious video shows how Stewie manages to send his new friend off to sleep and stop the tears after some careful and patient stroking.

The clip, uploaded by the baby’s father Aaron Grant, 35, of Canada, ends with Stewie staring at the camera with great pride at what he has done.
