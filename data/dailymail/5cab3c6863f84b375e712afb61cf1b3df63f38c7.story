Henry Russell-Wade (pictured) repeatedly raped an Australian woman twice his age, a court heard

An estate agent repeatedly raped an Australian woman twice his age before sending naked pictures of her to friends captioned: 'Lol. Left this cougar wounded,' a court heard.

Henry Russell-Wade, 25, picked-up the 50 year-old mother-of-four, who was visiting London, during her first night out in the capital at the Notting Hill Arts Club, a jury was told.

Isleworth Crown Court heard they were ejected by security for excessive petting on the dance floor -then returned in the early hours to her short-let flat after the woman rejected Russell-Wade's advances to have sex in the street.

The woman, who has been in the same relationship for more than 30 years, told police she had no interest in the defendant when he approached her and two other middle-aged women in the club's smoking area, announcing he was out to: 'Find a cougar.'

She told the jury: 'He said he was an estate agent and kept lifting up his shirt to show his six-pack and pierced naval. I was not interested at all, my husband is six foot three and this man was short and skinny.

'I thought it was unusual he would seek out the company of more mature women when there were women there nearer his own age. I told him to seek younger company and pointed somebody out.'

Prosecutor Mr. David Smith said the woman visited the club alone on the recommendation of her hairdresser and met the two other women inside for the first time.

'They were approached by this defendant, who was obviously half their age, and found it amusing that this young man was being flirtatious with them.

Mr Smith said the defendant 'made it obvious his mind was on one thing and that was to find a cougar for the night' before the pair started kissing on the dance floor. 

The woman told the jury: 'He came up and started kissing me, which was a surprise to me because I was listening to the music, dancing and had my eyes closed.

'He was forcing his tongue into my mouth, which was unpleasant and I said: 'Be gentle, be gentle.' He pushed me back against a wall. I had nowhere to go.

'I was not in a state to consent to anything and he would be the last man on earth I'd give consent to. I didn't have much chance and he had his tongue in my mouth.

'I'm a married woman with four children and I've never kissed any other man other than my husband.' 

Mr. Smith told the jury that the defendant 'asked if she would have sex with him in the street' but she said she had a flat nearby. He then helped 'guide her home' and asked to come in, the court heard.

'She was under no illusion where this was going to lead and anticipated sex would take place, saying her judgement was impaired by alcohol,' Mr Smith said.

'Intercourse began, but she felt sick and asked Mr Russell-Wade to stop, but he carried on and she says she was in great pain.'

The woman called police at 2.30pm the following afternoon, added Mr. Smith. 'She was concerned compromising photos had been taken of her in her flat and was concerned they would be distributed on the internet.'

However, she was already eight hours too late because the defendant had sent images of her to his friends at 6.30am. 'He was sending photos. Naked ones of her.

'In one she was on her feet and in another beside the bed on the floor and his friends thought it was all highly amusing and replied: 'LOL.'

When she called the police the woman told them: 'I'm not claiming I was raped or anything like that.'

'She then opened up and said sex took place without her consent and there was a significant tone of embarrassment in her voice,' said Mr. Smith.

The woman was examined at a 'Haven' centre and bruising and marks were found on her collarbones, forearms, shins, knees and back.

'She also found blood on the sheets of her bed.'

Police identified Russell-Wade via an image taken of all customers entering the club and when questioned he denied restraining or grabbing the shoulders of the complainant.

'He said they had very rough sex.'

Russell-Wade, of Greenford, London has pleaded not guilty to three counts of raping the woman in August at the flat in Bayswater.

The trial continues.
