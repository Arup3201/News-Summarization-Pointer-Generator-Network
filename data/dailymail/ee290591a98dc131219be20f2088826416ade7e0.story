It's the most successful Youtube video of all time, now even giant pandas are doing their own version of the famous Gangnam dance.

Zoo keepers watched in amazement as Qin Chuan stood up on his hind legs and assumed a pose with an uncanny resemblance to Psy's smash hit routine.Â 

Unfortunately his playmate LeLe seemed more interested in chewing on bamboo leaves.

Parodies of the Korean dance have been popping up all over the world as it recently surpassed 1 billion hits.

So it shouldn't come as a surprise that those in the animal kingdom are getting in on the act.

The pair of giant pandas, who moved to
China's Jinbao Amusement Park in Weifang, Shandong two years ago, have been spotted copying human behaviour before.

At
the sight of the first snow of the year, LeLe also jumped up on his 
hind quarters and started running forward as if looking for a hug.

This time it was Qin Chuan who, after
twirling around his enclosure several times, padded off looking fairly 
pleased with himself.

Spectators were delighted by the show and judging by this performance, Qin Chuan will be expecting the lead bear's role.
