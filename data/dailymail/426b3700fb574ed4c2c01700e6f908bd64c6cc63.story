Arsene Wenger admitted his Arsenal side are one of the FA Cup favourites after they did what their big rivals failed to do this weekend — reach the fifth round. 

The Arsenal manager, whose side avoided an upset with a 3-2 win at Brighton, said the string of fourth-round giant-killings on Saturday ‘woke us up a bit’. 

With Manchester City and Chelsea falling victim to shock defeats and Manchester United and Liverpool facing replays, FA Cup holders Arsenal are the only superpower through.

Wenger said: ‘We will fight and we want to retain our Cup. I think Saturday’s results were a bit of a subconscious warning for us. It woke us up a bit.’

Chelsea were beaten 4-2 at home by League One Bradford, while City went down 2-0 to Championship side Middlesbrough.

Wenger said: ‘Yes, Brighton are a Championship team, but if you are not ready you can lose. I thought that the results showed our game would be different against them.

‘We will be one of the favourites now but with Saturday’s results you would be a bit cautious, the Cup is the Cup. What you want is to focus on the next round and go through.

‘We have good experience from last season to know that every round is difficult. The most difficult games weren’t the expected ones.’

On his side’s display, he added: ‘I believe our performance was good and there was room to score more goals, with the chances we created. After that they had two shots on target, so overall we did the performance I expected.

‘We’ve got good momentum, but let’s keep the urgency level very high and we know how quick momentum can die in football.

The rampant League One side put four goals past Chelsea in one of the biggest Cup upsets in recent times 

Middlesbrough are in the hat for the fifth round after they were victorious over Manchester City on Saturday 

‘So we have to compete in every game and earn the right to win games.’

Brighton boss Chris Hughton believes that Arsenal have a good chance to go on and win the trophy. He said: ‘Yes, I would expect them to be right up there and of course they had a very good day on Saturday, with the might of Chelsea and Manchester City going out.

‘So I would see they are right up there as favourites, perhaps with Manchester United.’

Of his own side’s display, Hughton said: ‘I thought we showed great character against a very, very good Arsenal side.’

Meanwhile, Wenger revealed Arsenal’s £13.5million move for Villarreal defender Gabriel Paulista was close to completion. He said: ‘The deal is on the line at the moment, I expect it to be over the line overnight.’

The move, however, is subject to the Brazilian obtaining a work permit, which is not a formality as he has not played international football.
