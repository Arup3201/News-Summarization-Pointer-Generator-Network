These are the four men killed in a drive-by shooting shooting as they sat in a stolen car in an upscale part of San Francisco.

Authorities named David Saucier, 20,  Yalani Chinyamurindi, 19, Harith Atchan, 21, and Manuel O'Neal, 22 as the victims shot dead in Hayes Valley on Friday night.

Police are yet to name any suspects in the killings, which police say involved shots fired from at least two and as many as four different guns.

Extra police patrols are in place, and the San Francisco Police Department's gang task force was put into action after well-heeled residents spoke of their shock at violence plaguing their neighborhood.

Speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle, local Landon Fabianski said: 'I thought it was more of an upscale neighborhood. I never thought there would be a shooting of that nature here.'

Heather Houston, 33, concurred, saying: 'It seems like such a nice, safe neighborhood.'

The four men were shot dead a few blocks from San Francisco's golden domed City Hall where trendy cafes, antique stores and popular restaurants continue to open in a neighborhood long plagued by gang violence.

Ten men and a woman are currently in jail awaiting trial on federal charges of murder, racketeering and a host of other counts connected to a gang authorities say is based in the neighborhood. It is not clear whether the gang is involved in these killings.

Community leaders assembled at the African American Culture Center Monday said parents and residents were afraid of more violence in reprisal for the killings and were keeping their children inside.

'Our community is bleeding,' said Mattie Scott, a community activist whose 24-year-old son was slain in the same neighborhood in 1996. 'Fear is a major issue right now.' 

A makeshift memorial of candles, flowers and handwritten signs appeared on the sidewalk next to where the shooting occurred across the street from the Samovar Tea Lounge and the San Francisco Zen Center. Two bullet holes remained visible in an empty store front. Graffiti mourning one of the men slain was spray painted on a nearby apartment building.

A prayer vigil was scheduled for late Monday at the center.

Yalini Chinyamurindi's mother told the Chronicle her son was at the 'wrong place at the wrong time.'

Asale-Haqueenyah Chandler said her son worked at a nearby Japanese restaurant, was on his 30-minute break, and was headed to a liquor store to cash his paycheck.

'He called his friend to pick him up,' Chandler said. 'He only had a half hour. He wanted to give me some money toward our rent and save money for a car.'

Witnesses reported more than a dozen shots were fired into the double-parked car.

'I heard 'pop, pop,' about 15 times in quick succession,' said Jason Palmer, who was walking his dog two blocks away when the killings occurred.

Palmer, an actor who moved to San Francisco 18 months ago, said the neighborhood is plagued with graffiti and crime.
