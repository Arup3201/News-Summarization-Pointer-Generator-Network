Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches is the subject of renewed interest from Roma. 

The deal has been bubbling for several months and the Italians have made contact again with the Romanian's representatives. 

Tottenham dismissed reports on Monday that they were being offered Mattia Destro as part of a deal and the likelihood is Roma will make an offer to loan Chiriches with a permanent deal to follow.

The 25-year-old is free to leave White Hart Lane but the club want to recoup the £7million they paid for him

The north London side want to recoup the £7million they paid for the 25-year-old who has made 14 appearances this season.

The Romanian defender's only goal this season came earlier this month in an FA Cup win against Burnley at White Hart Lane.

The former Steaua Bucharest defender has been a regular in his side's FA Cup and Capital One Cup fixtures so far this season.
