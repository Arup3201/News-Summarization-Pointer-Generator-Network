A Saudi Arabian official has been caught on camera beating migrant workers and chasing them out of a passport office in the latest revelation of poor treatment of foreigners in the country.

The video filmed in the coastal city of Jeddah shows the official lashing out with a thick leather belt and shouting 'Out!', as visitors to the office run to safety.

He appears to hit one man, an African, in the face with the strap, before pushing him backwards as the migrant tries to hold the weapon to prevent further blows.

Beating: A Saudi passport official is caught on camera dishing out a blow with his belt to an African migrant worker who is at the office to get his work permit and immigration papers legalised

The video, filmed on Sunday and 
uploaded to YouTube the same day, will reignite anger at the way migrant
 workers are treated in the oil-rich Gulf kingdom.

Saudi
 Arabia has become increasingly dependent on foreign labour, and 
although foreign workers often fill technical positions, most are now 
employed in the agriculture, cleaning and domestic service industries. 

The
 hierarchy of foreign workers is often dependent on their country of 
origin, with the lower positions occupied by people from Africa, the 
Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.

Now
 however the situation for migrants is increasingly precarious, with 
many facing expulsion from the country as its rulers try to curb high 
unemployment, which reached 12 per cent by the end of 2012.

Some 200,000 have already been rounded up and sent home by authorities keen to free up the labour market for Saudi workers.

Jeddah-based human rights activist Walid Abou Al-khail told France 24 how the deportation measures had lead to a flood of migrants visiting passport offices to attempt to legalise their status.

'Many workers have been able to come here by getting a sponsor, and then leaving them in order to work for themselves,' said Mr Al-khail.

'Others change sponsor. So these workers' situation is not legal in the eyes of the state. And some have entered the country with a pilgrim visa, and then they’ve stayed and worked illegally.

'It is these workers who are targeted by the government’s expulsion measures. The campaign has given rise to abuse: there are images showing hundreds of workers packed into trucks, sent back home from one day to the next, even though they have all their belongings here.'

Mr Al-khail told how the passport centres were being overwhelmed by the numbers of applicants.

'These images are shocking, but unfortunately they offer just one small example of the mistreatment suffered by migrant workers in Saudi Arabia,' he added.

The video was uploaded to YouTube  on Sunday by Abdulaziz Taj. In the clip's description he tells how it was filmed by his father who was accompanying his domestic worker on a visit to the passport centre.

'I think there is an association of animal rights to prevent animals being hit in this brutal manner, let alone human beings!' Mr Taj wrote.

'I'm waiting for a response from anyone official,' he added.
