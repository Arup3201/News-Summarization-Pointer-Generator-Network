Britain could be forced to contribute to its own EU rebate under ‘unacceptable’ new Brussels plans, which would cost the UK more than £800 million a year.

European Commission President Herman van Rompuy unveiled the extraordinary proposal yesterday, as he outlined his latest plans for the next seven-year EU budget.

Mr van Rompuy initially suggested that the UK could keep the £3.2 billion-a-year rebate famously secured by Margaret Thatcher.

European Council President Herman Van Rompuy's plan to dramatically cut Britain's EU rebate is likely to anger David Cameron

An EU diplomat said there was an acceptance among negotiators that ending Britain’s rebate would scupper any chance of a deal, adding: ‘People realise that no British prime minister can go back to the House of Commons and defend having given up the rebate.’

But detailed proposals revealed that Britain would be expected to contribute to its own rebate in future. Officials refused to say how much money would be involved.

But if the payment is made at the UK’s standard 13 per cent EU contribution, it would cost £416 million a year, or almost £3 billion over the seven-year period.

However, according to new documents the EU president wants to go even further and impose a 25 per cent cut for 2014 to 2020, costing a total of £5.6 billion.

British Government sources last night insisted that the rebate - which was watered down by Tony Blair - was ‘non-negotiable’.

A senior source also rejected a ‘compromise’ budget proposal which would see funding for the EU rise by more than the rate of inflation.

David Cameron has indicated he will veto anything that goes beyond a real-terms freeze when the budget negotiations begin in Brussels later this month.

‘Our position is extremely clear,’ the source said. ‘The Prime Minister has said he wants a budget freeze at worst and, with his veto last year, he has demonstrated he is serious about this.’ MPs voted earlier this month for the EU budget to be cut.

In 1984 the then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher secured the rebate by banging the table and demanding 'our own money back'

Tory MP Mark Reckless described Mr van Rompuy’s proposals as ‘ludicrous’.

Mr Reckless said: ‘A rebate that we 
have to pay for ourselves is not a rebate. It is a complete non-starter 
and suggests that they are not serious about achieving a deal - it is 
just unacceptable.

‘There has been a parting of the ways
between the EU leadership and the British people, and the gap is now so
wide it is hard to see how a deal can be done.’

Mr van Rompuy’s lastest proposals represent a modest reduction in the original one trillion euros (£800 billion) demanded by Brussels.

But a real terms freeze would require a cut of up to £160 billion in the plans - much further than Mr van Rompuy is willing to go.

British sources believe a deal is possible on a budget freeze this month, but unlikely. ‘A freeze is possible, but the landing pad is the size of a postage stamp and it’s covered in trip wires,’ a source said.’

Officials believe it is more likely that this month’s summit will result in a stand-off, with a decision delayed until next year. Sources in Brussels have suggested the summit could even be cancelled to allow Mr van Rompuy to save face.

Britain owes it EU rebate to Margaret Thatcher’s famously tough negotiating stance in Europe.

In 1984 the then Prime Minister secured the rebate by banging the table and demanding ‘our own money back’ during a summit with European leaders in Fontainebleau, in France.

When she threatened to withhold Britain’s annual payments to Brussels, fellow EU leaders eventually caved in.

In the intervening years the deal has been worth tens of billions of pounds to Britain.Tony Blair gave away a large chunk of the rebate during negotiations on the last seven-year budget deal.
