Attack: The mocked up newspaper which opened Sunday's episode of Sherlock featured a story, headlined 'Thames to become watery motorway' which took a swipe at the London Mayor

The BBC’s raison d’etre to spend the licence fee attacking Conservative politicians, Boris Johnson claimed today after a newspaper in hit show Sherlock branded him ‘dithering, incoherent and self-interested’.

The mocked up page did not name Mr Johnson directly, but referred to the ‘current mayor’ and a ‘hair-brained’ (sic) plan to turn the River Thames into a motorway.

It said it came after ‘recently-mocked concept of putting an airport in the middle of the estuary’ which Mr Johnson has championed as an alternative to expanding Heathrow.

The BBC tried to claim that that the newspaper and mayor featured in Sunday night’s episode were ‘entirely fictional’.

But the reference to the Boris Island airport plan and a quote from the ‘mayor’ saying ‘huzzah’ left little doubt who it referred to.

Mr Johnson accused the BBC of political bias, but suggested it was in the Corporation’s nature to criticse the Tories.

‘Whatever the BBC may say, they are entitled to spend taxpayers money attacking Conservative politicians, that’s what they do, that’s their raison d’etre,’ he told LBC 97.3.

‘If people can’t make fun of politicians what has gone wrong with the BBC.

‘It is unbelievable, unbelievable… I think it’s perfectly legitimate for people to satirise politicians and there you go.’

His criticism of the BBC comes after he told The Times: ‘It is elementary my dear Watson, I deduce a simple case of BBC bias.’

Sunday’s episode of Sherlock, entitled The Sign of Three, opened with a series of robberies by a gang which police repeatedly failed to catch.

Bias: Boris Johnson hit back at the political criticism in the newspaper seen in BBC show Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch (right)

Bizarre: The newspaper had nothing to do with the main storyline of the episode, which saw Dr John Watson marry his partner Mary Morstan, with Sherlock as best man

Boris Johnson appeared to compare Nick Clegg to a condom this morning in his latest attack on the Deputy Prime Minister.

The Mayor of London said the Liberal Democrat leader was 'there to fulfil a very important 
ceremonial function as David Cameron's lapdog come prophylactic 
protection device for all the difficult things that David Cameron has to
 do that cheese off' the public.

The two men, who both take part in regular phone-in shows on LBC 97.3 have repeatedly taken potshots at one another in the past, with Mr Clegg branding the mayor a "slacker" for only hosting a monthly call-in on the station while Mr Johnson claimed the DPM was an 'idle bum'.

In the opening seconds of the programme a newspaper page spun into view, with the headline ‘Bank gang leave cops clueless’.

But underneath it had a story headlined: Thames to become watery motorway.

The story, which could only be read by pausing the programme, said: ‘A new plan by the current Mayor of London to turn the Thames into a bustling water-bound version of the M25 has hit rush-hour traffic as reaction has been damper than a dip in the rat-infested drink.’

It went on to detail the ‘hair-brained scheme’ to create boats out of the iconic Routemaster bus, which Mr Johnson pledged to bring back to London’s streets.

When asked to explain the plan at an event, the ‘mayor’ in the story ‘was found to be dithering, incoherent, and self-interested’.

The story added that the plan comes 
after ‘the recently-mocked concept of putting an airport in the middle 
of the estuary’ which Mr Johnson has championed.

The
 newspaper had nothing to do with the main storyline of the episode, 
which saw Dr John Watson marry his partner Mary Morstan, with Sherlock 
as best man.

But the 
real-life London mayor joked that the real target of the story might 
have been his predecessor, Labour’s Ken Livingstone.

He
 told LBC: ‘I don’t rule out the possibility by the way that this is an 
attack on the previous Mayor who after all  himself spent large sums of 
public  money on investigating whether there should be a Thames estuary 
airport and used to drivel on about putting people on the river.

‘But unlike the previous mayor I actually expanded river transport.

Mr Johnson added: ‘We doubled the number of passengers on the river and we are actually getting somewhere at last in sorting our aviation capacity problems.

‘So whatever the BBC may say, they are entitled to spend taxpayers money attacking Conservative politicians, that’s what they do, that’s their raison d’etre. I don’t in any way want to discourage them.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Sherlock is a fictional drama series, both the newspaper and mayor featured in the episode were entirely fictional and were not named or politically affiliated.’

A new plan by the current Mayor of London to turn the Thames into a bustling water-bound version of the M25 has hit rush-hour traffic as reaction has been damper than a dip in the rat-infested drink.

The hair-brained (sic) scheme involved chartering disused boats, paying for their conversion into a version of London's famous bus, the Routemaster, but this plan has already foundered after pilot schemes revealed that customers were walking straight off the boat and into the icy currents of the Thames.

When asked to explain how the system might move forward, or even be profitable, or perhaps even to explain the point, the Mayor, who was at a self-promotion event, was found to be dithering, incoherent, and self-interested.

He said, "Well the fact of the matter is that Londoners need to recognise our great naval history, rather than naval gazing, and this will get the traffic moving while invoking memories of Nelson and the like. Huzzar!

The plan joins a long list of bizarre concepts including the recently-mocked concept of putting an airport in the middle of the estuary.
