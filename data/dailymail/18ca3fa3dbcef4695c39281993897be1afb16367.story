Aya, five, from Idlib in northwestern Syria, is a happy little girl who loves playing with her sisters and is doted on by her mother Sihan and father Ayman.

But the future is bleak for little Aya because, having been forced to flee to Lebanon in the face of the IS advance through Syria, she has no access to the medical care she desperately needs.

'She can’t cope with the cold weather,' says her worried mother. 'She has almost no chance of surviving if she doesn’t get care or a warm house.'

And, as a heartbreaking new documentary makes clear, Aya, who suffers from spina bifida and is paralysed from the waist down, is by no means unique. 

More than a million Syrian refugees currently live in Lebanon, eking out a living in the makeshift camps that dot the countryside.

Making the problem worse is the Islamic State advance, as refugees fleeing the jihadis add to pressure on camp clinics and food supplies. 

Although agencies such as UNHCR are attempting to deal with the influx, life for disabled refugees, among them those who have lost limbs thanks to the bloody civil war, is particularly difficult.

Aya, who suffers from spinal bifida, has a shunt that drains fluid from her brain, although it hasn't been replaced since she arrived at the camp.

She is also prone to pressure sores, which are now being treated by her mother, albeit with a wadded up old t-shirt instead of the dressings she needs.

The situation is far from ideal and her father, the manager of a soap factory in their old life in Syria, knows it. 

'It’s very difficult,' he admits. 'I feel useless. When I’m sitting at home without work [to pay for medical care] I might as well be a chair.'

The family do get some help from UNHCR in the form of food coupons worth $140 a month but doctors require money that Sihan, a former school teacher, and Ayman just don't have.

'You need money to go to hospital, but I have to borrow money just to buy bread for my children,' says Sihan. 'That’s all I can do

Big cuddle: Aya, who her mother describes as being 'like sunshine', reaches over to give Sihan a hug

Help: Aya's older sister Iman was the one who carried her into Lebanon as the family fled the IS advance

Limited: Although the family are given money to buy food by UNHCR, funds for medical care are nonexistent

'You can see our humiliation,' she adds. 'You see your daughter dying and no-one helps. In this camp no-one helps anyone. 

'We didn’t live like this in Syria. My children went to the best schools. We lived a happy life in Syria.'

But help, it seems, is not likely to be forthcoming any time soon. 'I would be the first to tell you that what refugees are able to receive does not meet all their needs,' admits UNHCR's Ninette Kelly.

'With 30 per cent of our budget funded, it’s simply impossible for us to cover all the basic needs that we need to cover.

'I feel so sad for them, so sad for their families, and also very sad for the frontline workers that have to be able to say I’m so sorry, we feel your need but we’re just unable to do anything about it because we don’t have the resources to do it. 

Deadly: As IS advance, more and more refugees are flocking across the border to Lebanon

Horror: Although air strikes have been launched against IS, they still hold several towns, including Raqqah

'And it all comes back to where is the source of this problem? The source of this problem is the on-going conflict in Syria that is wreaking havoc in this region, and that has torn apart so many lives with devastating consequences to Aya and to others.'

In the meantime, Sihan and Ayman are hoping for a miracle. 'She makes me feel that life is beautiful no matter what,' says Sihan of her youngest child.

'She’s stronger than she looks. When she was born, the doctors said there was no chance for her to survive and yet she’s still alive

'Aya doesn’t want to die. Aya wants to live.'
