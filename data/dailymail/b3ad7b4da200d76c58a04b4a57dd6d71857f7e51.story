The price of petrol has been cut to the lowest level this year, fuelling consumer confidence which has bounced back to pre-recession levels.

Asda is cutting the price of fuel by 2p a litre from this morning - setting a national cap of 126.7p a litre for unleaded and 133.7p on diesel.

Morrisons and other stores followed suit, but they vary prices depending on location and do not match Asda’s low prices on all forecourts.

The reductions will help consumers struggling to make ends meet after five years where price rises on essentials such as petrol, energy and food, have outstripped increases in pay.

It will further energise consumer optimism that the economy is now through the recession with improvements in the housing market, retail sales, manufacturing and job prospects.

An international study published today by retail analysts Nielsen reveals UK consumer confidence is at the highest level in six years.

The confidence index rating of 87 is the best since March 2007 and the fourth highest among consumers in 60 countries that were surveyed.

It is significantly above the European average of 71, while it was a lower 61 in France, 56 in Spain and 47 in Italy. Germany scored higher at 92.

Nielsen said this is the first time that the UK consumer confidence rating has risen to the level seen before the crash at the end of 2007 and in to 2008.

It said the number of consumers who 
believe the UK is out of recession is a five and half year high, while 
the proportion saying they are confident enough to spend – 39 per cent –
is at its best for seven years.

As the same time, the number of 
Britons feeling positive about their job prospects is up to 31 per cent,
which is the highest level for five and a half years.

The
petrol price cut by Asda follows reductions in the wholesale price of 
oil on global markets and will help families and British industry.

The
company is offering a simple price cut on its 223 forecourts, while 
some of its rivals have linked reductions to promotions and voucher 
schemes.

Asda’s Jeremy Walton, its head of 
petrol trading, said: ‘Our shoppers don’t have to figure out complicated
deals and collect vouchers to get the best price, they simply pay what 
they see at the pump.

‘No one is unfairly penalised for not 
spending enough or forced to spend more than they wanted to; everyone 
can save money with our price cuts.

‘Our prices are the lowest they have been all year and our national price cap on fuel means that no-one filling up at Asda is forced to pay a premium for their fuel because of where they live.’

Nielsen’s UK managing director, Chris Morley, said: ‘UK consumers have become more savvy shoppers over the last three years. By shopping differently, they have weathered the storm of rising household costs and falling real-term wages.

‘Throughout this period, British consumer confidence remained stubbornly weak, but in recent months it has finally taken an upward turn as the green shoots of economic recovery start to show.

‘Positive news around momentum in the UK housing market has added to the change in mood.

‘Looking ahead, many UK households still intend to spend carefully should economic conditions improve, so we anticipate a continuation of great offers for shoppers, and that leads us to forecast an easier ride for UK consumers over the next three years.’
