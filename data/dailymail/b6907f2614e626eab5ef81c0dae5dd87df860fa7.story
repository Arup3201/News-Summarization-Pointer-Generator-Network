There is a passage in Diego Torres’s book, 'The Special One - The Secret World of Jose Mourinho', which goes a long way to understanding the practices of Chelsea’s manager.

In the English version of Torres’s biography, the exchanges between Mourinho and Cristiano Ronaldo in the dressing room at Real Madrid start on page 138 and finish five pages later.

Here is an abridged version of the alleged events in the team meeting before the second leg of the 2011 Champions League semi-final against Barcelona, when Ronaldo had made it clear he expected Los Blancos to be more adventurous in the Bernabeu.

Oscar hasn't completed a full 90 minutes for Chelsea since mid-January. Here is is full recent record: 

Jan 31 Manchester City (substituted, 89)

Feb 7 Aston Villa (substituted, 73)

Feb 11 Everton (unused)

Feb 17 Paris Saint Germain (substitute, 83) 

Feb 21 Burnley (substituted, 72) 

Mar 1 Tottenham (substitute, 88) 

Mar 4 West Ham (substituted, 74) 

Mar 11 Paris Saint Germain (substituted, 45) 

Mar 15 Southampton (substituted, 82)

Mar 22 Hull (substitute, 61)

Apr 4 Stoke (substituted, 45)  

According to Torres, the Real Madrid coach told his star player: ‘I’m going to say it to your face: you complain that we play defensively. But do you know why we play this way? For you.

‘Because, as you don’t want to defend or cover the wings, I have to have the team sitting deep... when you come on, you do your own thing.’

That meeting, held in the presence of the great Zinedine Zidane, apparently lasted 40 minutes.

Real Madrid drew the second leg 1-1 and Barcelona progressed to the final, where they beat Manchester United 3-1 at Wembley.

Team meetings are a theme of Mourinho’s management, giving his players the floor during the fallow periods that inevitably occur during the course of a long season.

It is a pragmatic approach, one to be admired, unless you happen to be one of the players who challenges Mourinho’s coaching philosophy.

You cannot blame Oscar, the current fall-guy, for encouraging Chelsea to play with a sense of adventure at a team meeting that took place during their wobble at the end of January.

When you can call upon Oscar, Eden Hazard and Willian, why wouldn’t you?

Oscar has been put back in his box in recent weeks, failing to start or finish a full 90 minutes in all competitions for Chelsea since the 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg on January 27.

The Brazilian forward has not completed a Barclays Premier League match since the 5-0 victory at Swansea City, where he scored twice for the league leaders, 10 days earlier.

Oscar put Chelsea ahead in the opening minute at the Liberty Stadium and his second, when he beat Swansea keeper Lukas Fabianski in the 36th minute from the edge of the area, is the last time he has scored.

Since the 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the Capital One Cup at Stamford Bridge, Oscar has been substituted or been named substitute in 10 of Chelsea’s last 11 fixtures.

Here is the record in full. Manchester City (substituted, 89); Aston Villa (substituted, 73); Paris Saint-Germain (substitute, 83); Burnley (substituted, 72); Tottenham (substitute, 88); West Ham (substituted, 74); Paris Saint-Germain (substituted, 45); Southampton (substituted, 82); Hull (substitute, 61); Stoke (substituted, 45). Against Everton, on February 11, he was not in the squad.

Naturally Oscar has some concerns, worried that his views at a routine team meeting have been misinterpreted by this most demanding of managers.

Oscar was disappointing during last weekend's win, and Mourinho hit out at his performance afterwards

It is believed to have been innocuous, an observation from a player who has been a popular and respectful member of the Chelsea dressing room since his move from Internacional in 2012.

He is certainly not regarded as a troublemaker.

It was Oscar, after all, who is so highly-regarded by the coaching staff at Chelsea that he was considered a potential, future rival to the annual duel between Lionel Messi and Ronaldo for the Ballon d’Or.

When Oscar returned from the World Cup, where he scored the 90th minute goal for his country in their 7-1 rout by Germany in the semi-final, his first-class attitude to the new season was noted by coaching staff.

Despite the disappointment over the summer with the national team, he was eager to please Mourinho as he entered his third season with Chelsea.

In November, his sparkling form was rewarded with a new five-year contract, a move designed to keep him in that role off the main striker, Diego Costa, until 2019. All was well.

There is a touch of Brian Clough about Mourinho’s attitude towards him, a nod in the direction of the famous response he gave when asked about the way he dealt with disaffected players.

‘We talk about it for 20 minutes and then we decide I was right all along,’ Clough once remarked.

Oscar is certainly learning all about that as he deals with Mourinho’s mood swings.

‘No, I don’t think he had a bad performance, I just think his performance was not good enough, which is a huge difference,’ claimed Chelsea’s manager after their 2-1 victory over Stoke City on Saturday.

Naturally there is a little uncertainty about Oscar’s performances at the moment, reluctant to try anything out of the ordinary because of the potential consequences.

Oscar knows, like everyone else knows, that if you take on Mourinho, he will take you off.
