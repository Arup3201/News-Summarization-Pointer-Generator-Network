He's known as the 'King of Collagen', the 'Baron of Botox' and Dr Frederic Brandt uses more of both than any other dermatologist on the planet.

But Brandt isn't just about the injectables. He made a name for himself in the beauty naturals world by pioneering the use of green tea in skincare, and has his own beauty range (boasting products with names like 'Crease Release') to prove it.

Still, it's his cosmetic work and the invention of what has been dubbed the 'New New Face' that has brought hundreds of women in pursuit of eternal youthfulness to his door - A-list celebrities among them.

The Botox Baron: Dr Frederic Brandt pioneered the use of injectables, and also green tea

Although Brandt is evangelical about the anti-ageing power of green tea, he's no slouch when it comes to using injectables on himself, and controversially, argues that cosmoceuticals should be used to prevent wrinkles as well as deal with them once they appear.

'As far as procedures go, [you should start considering them] in your mid to late 30’s,' he says. 'In terms of prevention, it is never too early to begin cosmetic procedures and treatment.'

One of the first to use fillers and Botox, Brandt, who first set up shop in 1982, was instrumental in getting the substances approved for cosmetic use in the USA.

Initially billed as an alternative to surgical cosmetic procedures, injectables have since become an industry in their own right, with spending on them going up by a staggering 784 per cent in the last decade alone.

So was he expecting Botox to be such a success? 'I did,' he replies, enthusiasm in his voice. 'I saw its potential when I first started using it.

'I 
marbled the results upon initial use and knew it was going to be one of 
the most innovative, influential procedures to be performed. 

Not that Brandt is resting on his 
laurels. Despite his love for the wrinkle-freezer, he's casting around for something new, despite not being totally convinced by the results he's had thus far.

'The newest form of botox to be approved 
in the U.S. is Xeomin which has a lower amount of protein mixed in with 
the toxin,' he muses. 'It remains to be seen whether it differs substantially from 
the presently available forms.'

Whether Botox or Xeomin, the reason for the success of Brandt and his 'New New Face' is the result. Unlike traditional cosmetic surgery, 'New, New Face' treatments should leave you looking fresh-faced, radiant and recognisable, albeit considerably younger.

So at what point should you start? According to Brandt, although treatment for preventing wrinkles can never begin too soon, you need to wait until you actually have some before bringing out the big guns. 

'If you have no lines, you are too young,' he says. 'I
feel that there is no "right age" to start considering Botox as it is
 based more on a patient’s biological age rather than their 
chronological age. 

'For example there are women in their 20’s with a lot
 of sun damage who are showing signs of aging who might be a candidate 
for it when at the same time there are women in their 40’s who do not 
have fine lines or wrinkles yet.

He's also wary of overdoing it and is rumoured to have turned actress Demi Moore away when she asked for more Botox than he deemed necessary.

'It definitely is possible to have too much Botox,' he reveals. 'If you use too much, you can create a very unnatural look, 
and you can also create a heavy brow effect if you over-botox the 
forehead.'

How about women who want to avoid injectables altogether? What should they be doing? Once again Dr Brandt has some advice.

'The most important thing is to apply sunscreen every day - minimum of SPF30, come rain or shine,' he says. 'Try to avoid the sun whenever possible. A teaspoon of sunscreen should be used for the face, and an additional teaspoon should be used for each arm.

'Sunscreen should be re-applied when you are exposed to the sun for prolonged periods of time.

Apply peptide cream at night and antioxidant cream daily,' he continues. 'Exfoliate the skin once or twice a week, depending on skin type and lastly, apply eye cream morning and night.'

Big business: The use of cosmetic fillers and Botox has increased by 734 per cent over the last decade

From a super-smooth forehead to gently plumped lips and a fresh-faced glow, Brandt's New New Face is all about looking like you, only better and younger. Demi Moore and Madonna, both of whom look like improved versions of their younger selves, are the ideal.

Forehead: Smooth and wrinkle-free, usually achieved with the help of Botox injections

Eyes: Wide and Bambi-like with no deep creases in between. This can be created by injecting filler into the lower eyelids. 

Nose: Straight and feminine. The Duchess of Cambridge's nose is currently the most requested model.

Lips: Full and slightly turned up, although not too much: trout pouts are definitely out

Cheeks: Plump and youthful. This is created by injecting filler just below the cheekbone, which adds anti-ageing volume.
