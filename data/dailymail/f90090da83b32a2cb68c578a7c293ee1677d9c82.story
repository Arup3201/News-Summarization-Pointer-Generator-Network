Hundreds of independent sports shops could be forced out of business after Nike and adidas announced they will no longer supply outlets that sell less than £25,000 of their products.

The two firms, far and away the UK's market-leading sportswear brands, say it is no longer economically viable for them to supply smaller shops.

Nike, which sponsors the England football team and may of the country's top players including Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, claims the move aimed to cut costs and improve consumer experience.

Meanwhile Adidas, which sponsored the
 British Athletics team at the London Olympics amid pledges to support 
sport in the community, said the decision to ditch outlets that were 
'not efficient' was taken in line with their 'global commercial policy'.

But
 former Olympics minister Tessa Jowell, whose local sports shop Ace 
Sports in Kentish Town is among the businesses affected, has fiercely 
condemned the decision.

Criticism: Former Olympics minister Tessa Jowell has slammed the move

She told the Evening Standard: 'It is behaviour which is inconsistent with the promotion of local sports participation.

'A shop like that is never going to reach that sort of turnover.

'But if you take brands out, it is much, much less appealing.

'They
 should of course reconsider and make it clear they will have a policy 
in relation to the very small shops  - maybe not turnover of their 
product but turnover more generally.' 

Nick Mavrides, the owner of Ace Sports, 
told the newspaper: 'They just want to get into bed with the big chains
 - JD Sports, Footlocker, and they don't care about anyone else.

'Their action seriously affects my ability to conduct my business. It will have a catastrophic effect and force me to close'.

Adidas, which also owns the Reebok 
brand, has those retailers affected by the decision that they can 
reapply for an account but need to supply business plans to show how 
they aim to reach the £25,000 target.

Ace Sports in Kentish Town, London is a typical small, independent sports shop and one of the retailers which will be affected the move

The retailers would also be required to attend sports shows and pass a 'Distribution Trading Policy check'.

In 2003 David Beckham signed a £100million lifetime contract with adidas earning half the money up front and percentages of the profits from his branded adidas products.

Adidas, which is based in Bavaria, Germany had assets estimated to be worth around £10 billion in 2012, almost exactly the same as U.S-owned Nike.
