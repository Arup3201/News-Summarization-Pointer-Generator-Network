Millions of viewers were left stunned
 last night as Matthew Crawley was killed in a car crash moments after 
seeing his newborn son in Downton Abbey’s Christmas Day special. The 
much-loved character, played by Dan Stevens, died after swerving off the
 road to avoid another vehicle.

The fatal twist was so unforeseen that it took the breath away. In Downton Abbey, after two hours of premonitions that Lord Grantham’s oldest daughter, Mary, would suffer the fate of her sister Sybil and die in childbirth, an entirely different tragedy occurred.

It happened off-screen: an open-topped roadster on a country lane, a looming lorry, and then a cut to Maggie Smith in the Abbey drawing room, reflecting that ‘we don’t always get our just deserts’.

That was, for her, an uncharacteristic understatement. Mary’s husband, cousin Matthew, was bowling home from the maternity hospital, where he had just kissed hello to his baby son, born a few weeks premature.

Unforeseen: Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) and his wife Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) and their baby. Matthew had just left the maternity hospital when he was killed in a car crash

He told his wife that he felt as if he’d swallowed a box of fireworks. She told him to remember the feeling, so that he’d forgive her more easily next time she did something silly... like crashing his precious car.

Downton Abbey has never been Matthew’s story: it’s a family saga. And yet he has been the pivot, the axle for the free-wheeling plot.

He was the war hero, the lover who was paralysed, the heir who could not father children, the saviour who saved the estate from bankruptcy. To see him, dead on the roadside, a thick bead of blood drooling from his ear, was a shock.

This was the coup de grace in a Christmas season’s viewing that left no heartstring unwrung. Not only were Arthur and Gawain both dead in the final episode of Merlin, but the Doctor’s new companion suffered a fatal plunge from a cloud, just moments after she was given the key to the Tardis in Dr Who.

But Matthew’s death was the  climax, a jaw-dropper in the final seconds of a two-hour Downton special. The rest of the episode was a bizarre summer holiday in Scotland for the aristocracy, and a day at the village fair for the below-stairs cast.

The Granthams were off to a cousin at Duneagle Castle in the Highlands, for a spot of stalking. In the Twenties, that meant shooting wildlife with antlers, not lurking on footpaths for a glimpse of someone you fancy (although Thomas the footman did a spot of that, and got a beating from the local roughs as a result).

The Highlands excursion meant magnificent Scottish scenery, but the effect was much the same as one of Coronation Street’s periodic mass outings to Blackpool. Storylines in the open air seemed melodramatic instead of intense.

The vast glens and mountainsides could not compensate. As Lady Grantham remarked wearily: ‘That is the thing about nature, there’s so much of it.’

And then there was the question of what to wear in the evening.

‘I’m taking a diamond tiara,’ one character murmured. ‘Might not need it, but I’d rather be safe than sorry.’

To underline the ancestry of the series, and its direct descent from the Eighties classic Brideshead Revisited, Phoebe Nicholls appeared.

She played a foul-tempered, nagging niece, but she hasn’t changed so much since she was Sebastian’s idealistic, ultra-Catholic little sister.

The only Christmassy theme was the impending birth, a theme that Call The Midwife was able to play with clever and moving ways. From the first moment, when a nurse’s hands were washing a tiny wooden baby from the nativity scene, there were echoes and parallels with the Bethlehem story.

A child was born, not in a stable but in the communal toilet of a block of flats.

Another baby was left in a cardboard box on the convent steps, and the episode hinged on the need to find the unmarried mother.

In a poignant sub-plot, an old woman who had spent half her life in the workhouse was taken to find the graves of her children.

The cause of death for all of them had been, in the evasive officialese of the day, ‘failure to thrive’ – in other words, malnourishment. For all its nostalgia, Call The Midwife is clear-eyed about the bad old days.

But it is gleeful about an era before health and safety, too. As the caretaker struggled to get the Christmas tree lights working, he called out to a grubby-kneed boy, ‘Go on sonny, go and wiggle that plug for me. Clump it one.’ The lights duly blew up.

Best line of the night went to the irritable nun who was about to set out on her Boxing Day rounds to give insulin injections to diabetics.

‘They’ll all have been at the Quality Street, every man-jack of them,’ she grumbled. ‘If I was the prime minister, I’d shut that factory down.’
