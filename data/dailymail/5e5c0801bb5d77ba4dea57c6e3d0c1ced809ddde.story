Authorities in Russia warned the FBI ‘multiple times’ about Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, though the ethnic Chechen could have slipped through the cracks because he was not linked to al Qaeda, it was revealed Tuesday by U.S. Senators who were briefed on the terrorist attacks.

The federal agency looked into the eldest brother in 2011 after the Russian government contacted them, warning that Tamerlan Tsarnaev may have deveoped radical Islamic ties following a prolonged trip to Russia, including Muslim-predominant Dagestan.

However, after its initial search and interviews with him and his family members, the FBI closed the case, and has come under intense scrutiny for doing so.

Conflicting: Tamerlan Tsarnaev turned from an 'arrogant' sportsman to an increasingly radical Muslim. Studying the Koran alone in Dagestan; Russian authorities tried to alert the FBI over the 'bomber' multiple times, according to lawmakers

Speaking with the Boston Herald, a senator sitting in on Tuesday’s confidential meetings on Capitol Hill said that the FBI could have missed Tamerlan Tsarnaev’s radicalization as he didn’t share links to the terror network al Qaeda.

That senator spoke on the condition of anonymity, as Tuesday’s briefings were classified.

Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, told the Herald that the Russian government also had very different priorities. ‘Their concern was Chechen radicals. Our higher concern was al-Qaeda,’ he told the paper, explaining that the militant Islamist group was more dangerous to the U.S. in light of the 9/11 attacks.

Lawmakers 
again asked whether a failure to share intelligence contributed to the 
deadly, after senior officials briefed them on the investigation into 
last week's bombings, the Boston Globe reports.

However, members of Congress have not 
gone insofar as to say that better or more thorough intelligence could 
have prevented the bombings, which many said following the September 11,
 2001 terrorist attacks.

'There still seem to be serious 
problems with sharing information, including critical investigative 
information ... not only among agencies but also within the same agency 
in one case,' Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said after the Senate 
Intelligence Committee members were briefed by FBI Deputy Director Sean 
Joyce.

'I don't see anybody yet that dropped 
the ball,' said Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Georgia, the committee's vice 
chairman, according to the Associated Press.

Intel: Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Tuesday in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on immigration legislation, that her agency knew of the suspect's trip to Russia even though his name was misspelled on a travel document

On the attack: Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told Napolitano that the information contradicted what he'd been told by the FBI

But he added that he was asking all 
the federal agencies involved for more information to make sure enough 
information was shared. 'If it wasn't, we've got to fix this,' he said.

Homeland Security Secretary Janet 
Napolitano said Tuesday, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee on immigration legislation, that her agency knew of the 
suspect's trip to Russia even though his name was misspelled on a travel
 document.

A key lawmaker had said the misspelling caused the FBI to miss the trip.

Napolitano's disclosure came as news 
to Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who told the secretary that it
 contradicted what he'd been told by the FBI.

'They told me that they had no 
knowledge of him leaving or coming back, so I would like to talk to you 
more about this case,' Graham told Napolitano.

She said that even though
 Tsarnaev's name was misspelled, redundancies in the system allowed his 
departure to be captured by U.S. authorities in January 2012.

But she said that by the time he came 
back six months later, an FBI alert on him had expired and so his 
re-entry was not noted. The FBI has not released a new statement 
regarding Tamerlan Tsarnaev’s trip to Russia since April 17.

Investigators have concluded based on 
preliminary evidence that the Russia trip may have helped radicalize 
Tsarnaev, the older of the two bomber suspects, who died in a firefight 
with police.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev was investigated by 
the FBI at Russia's request and his name was included in a federal 
government travel-screening database after that, law enforcement 
officials have told The Associated Press.

Religious journey? Tamerlan Tsarnaev spent much time in the Dagestan capital of Makhachkala

One official told the AP that by the 
time of the flight Tsarnaev would have faced no additional scrutiny 
because the FBI had by that time found no information connecting him to 
terrorism.

The ethnic Chechen brothers imigrated 
to the United States a decade ago from the predominantly Muslim region 
of Dagestan in Russia's Caucasus.

Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, 
the ranking Republican on the Senate intelligence committee, said the 
briefing raised questions about the flow of information among law 
enforcement and intelligence agencies.

'I think there has been some 
stonewalls, and some stovepipes reconstructed, that were probably 
unintentional, but we've got to review that issue again, and make sure 
there is the free flow of information,' he said, according to Reuters.

'I can't say the FBI dropped the ball. I don't see anybody yet that dropped the ball,' he said. 'That may develop.'
