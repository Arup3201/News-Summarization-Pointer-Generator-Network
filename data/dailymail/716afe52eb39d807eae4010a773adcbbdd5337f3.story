Click here for your ultimate stats guide from the game including the move for Everton's opening goal scored by James McCarthy.

The clamour for Ross Barkley's inclusion in England's World Cup squad has been aimed mainly at Roy Hodgson, but it would appear Roberto Martinez has heeded it as well.

As a native of Catalonia, the Everton manager could be forgiven if his international loyalties lay with Spain, rather than England.

But he showed a commendable regard for his adopted country's prospects in Brazil this summer by omitting Barkley and John Stones from Everton's final Barclays Premier League game of the season to ensure they would be fit for international duty.

It could yet be the Under 21 tournament in Toulon, but Barkley, in particular, must have high hopes of a senior call-up when Hodgson names his 23-man squad for the World Cup at 2pm on Monday. Stones, too, could be a surprise selection, given injury concerns over Phil Jones and Kyle Walker.

*Player Ratings by JOHN EDWARDS

'Ross and John were two of the players
 I had to protect,' said Martinez. 'We get so many stats and information
 about players' physical condition and how they are coping, and 
sometimes the message is there is a risk of injury if you play them.

'These
 two boys have played a lot of football recently and needed a rest. It 
was in the interests of their health, but it is also the case that, as a
 club, we are happy to produce as much English talent as we can.

'That 
was one of the reasons we had to look after them. We made sure they 
didn't go into the summer with the risk of injury.

'They
 are going to be busy, one way or the other.

'I honestly have no idea 
whether it will be with the seniors or Under 21s, but, either way, we 
will be very proud to see Everton players pulling on the England jersey.

'Any
 manager you ask in the Premier League will be biased and say their 
players should be in the national team, but I am not going to go down 
that route.

'I trust Roy Hodgson's vision, I am a big admirer of his 
experience, and whatever he does will be part of a plan.'

Everton were 
firmly in control from the moment James McCarthy fired them ahead with 
his first goal for the club in only the ninth minute. Set up by Romelu 
Lukaku and Steven Naismith, the midfielder's angled drive was too hot to
 handle for fit-again keeper Allan McGregor, who got a glove to it but 
couldn't keep it out.

Hull 
rarely threatened, other than a late Robert Koren shot that brought the 
best out of Tim Howard, and slipped further behind when Lukaku marked 
his farewell appearance in familiar style in the 46th minute.

The
 on-loan Chelsea striker, who is due to return to Stamford Bridge, latched on to a pinpoint pass from Leon Osman and fired past 
McGregor, after holding off Paul McShane's challenge.

McGregor
 looks to have played his way into Steve Bruce's FA Cup final line-up, 
after returning ahead of schedule from a serious kidney injury, but it 
was one of few bright spots for the Hull manager.

'We
 will see how he feels after today, but he has done everything he 
possibly could to earn a place at Wembley,' said Bruce. 'The chairman is
 going to be disappointed with finishing 16th. It's £1.2million prize 
money for each place, and we could have been a few places higher with a 
win, and that could have meant a new player for next season.

'We
 have had an awful end to the season, and the distraction of the Cup 
final is largely to blame. The performances since the semi-final just 
haven't been us, and that has been disappointing.'

Moving on: Hull boss Steve Bruce they can still end the season on a high in Saturday's FA Cup Final vs Arsenal

Martinez saluted Lukaku's contribution and offered Hull some tips on how to spring a Wembley upset against Arsenal, 12 months after plotting Wigan's Cup final triumph against Manchester City.

'In any loan deal, all you want is for it to be a success, and Romelu has been,' he said. 'I’ve seen him grow as a man and player, and I think he’s developed unique memories with Everton. The fans will always have a great mental picture of Lukaku’s talent.

'I think the parent club will delighted with the progress he has made this season, and we’ve benefitted from having him. It couldn't have gone much better.

'It is a real achievement for Hull to reach the final, and it is in their favour that they go there as underdogs. They found it difficult in the semi-final because they were favourites, but it is the opposite this time. If they can control their emotions and be themselves, they can really embrace what will be a fantastic opportunity to spring a surprise.'
