Bill Cosby's appearances at Las Vegas and Arizona casinos have been canceled amid widening allegations of sexual assault.

No reason was given by Diamond Desert Casino in Tucson, Arizona for the canceled February 15 show. 

Las Vegas' Treasure Island confirmed on Friday that the comedian's show, the day after Thanksgiving, had been canceled, reportedly by 'mutual agreement'. 

Broadway Center in Tacoma, Washington also just pulled out of an April Cosby show according to TMZ, saying they took into consideration 'the financial harm we will suffer by cancelling, and even greater financial risk of moving forward with the performance.'

In the past week, numerous allegations of sexual abuse against Cosby, 77, from a number of women have led to canceled interviews along with NBC and Netflix projects.

The show must go on: Cosby was on stage in Barbados on Thursday night

Including an appearance in Melbourne, Florida tonight, Cosby is slated to perform at least 36 shows between now and May 2015. 

Cosby issued a statement on Sunday discrediting decades-old accusations and his attorney has denied four of the allegations. 

He made his first stage appearance since the scandal emerged  at a benefit on Thursday night for a women's service organization in the Bahamas.

During the performance, the 77-year-old put his head in his hands and pretended to sob, new video obtained by MailOnline has revealed today.

He joked that parents would not let their children near him, as fans in the audience laughed and applauded the skit.

'Parents are coming and taking their children home, saying to me ''Bill Cosby you are an evil man!'',' the entertainer said through faux tears on stage.

But the entertainer then shook it off, smiled and started what became a well-scripted 90 minute performance.

A total of nine women have now come forward this month claiming the famed entertainer abused them. 

MailOnline was awaiting comment from Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, on Friday.

Former supermodel Janice Dickinson has claimed that Bill Cosby drugged and raped her

Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier.

Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby.

Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him.

Janice Dickinson - The supermodel said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her.

Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows.

Louisa Moritz -  She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex, backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she went through with it.

Linda Joy Traitz - She said earlier this week that she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client.
