Most women dream of winning the lottery, hitting the stores and buying a whole new wardrobe.But the mother of two who has scooped the latest £40million EuroMillions jackpot bucked the trend yesterday by declaring: ‘I hate shopping.’

Catherine Bull, 35, will, however, splash out on one particular luxury – a new  carpet for her upstairs landing, because the current one is in a ‘terrible’ state.

The purchase will leave plenty of change from the £40,627,241 she and husband Gareth won in the draw on Friday night.

Lottery joy: Gareth and Catherine Bull revealed today they haven't yet told their two sons that they scooped almost £41million on the Euromillions last Friday

Asked if she planned to go shopping with her winnings, horrified Mrs Bull said she couldn’t think of anything worse.

‘I have never been much of a shopper and I can’t see that changing now,’
 she said. ‘I already have home food delivery from Tesco because I hate 
shopping.

‘And I have no style sense – I usually wear leggings and jeans. I want a
 new upstairs landing carpet. It’s terrible – nobody is allowed to go 
upstairs.’

Despite their huge win the Nottinghamshire couple say they have ‘no plans’ to quit work or move out of their home.

Huge win: Gareth and Catherine Bull scooped almost £41million on the EuroMillions last Friday

Sealed with a kiss: Mr and Mrs Bull, from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, are presented with their winner's cheque today

Mr Bull, a self-employed builder, bought the ticket on a whim after he was unable to work one day because it was raining.

The 40-year-old only realised the following morning that they had hit the jackpot.

Where they live now: Mrs Bull said she already has her dream home and her ambitions only stretch as far as buying a new carpet after they scooped almost £41million

Joy: Mr and Mrs Bull have pledged to support breast cancer charities with their winnings after her mother was hit by the disease five years ago

Toasting their success: The first thing Mr and Mrs Bull bought was an iPad - but said they have been so busy they have not even switched it on

Their new £41m fortune may have made them as rich as Kylie Minogue, but Gareth and Catherine Bull are relatively poor when compared with other jumbo jackpot winners.

Their prize is only the seventh biggest won in the UK.

Colin
 and Chris Weir, from Largs, Scotland, scooped £161m last July, another anonymous ticket holder collected £113m and Dave and Angela Dawes scooped £101m in October.

The fourth-biggest prize winner in the UK won £84million in May 2010 on the EuroMillions.

In February 2010, Nigel Page and Justine Laycock, from Gloucestershire, broke the then record with a £56million win – now the fifth-biggest prize in the history of EuroMillions.

The sixth-biggest payout went to Les and Sam Scadding in South Wales who won £45millon in November 2009.

Overseas, the biggest ever single win was the £195million Andrew Whittaker pocketed in West Virginia, U.S., in 2002.

Elaine
 and Harold Messner from New Jersey shared the world’s largest lottery 
prize of £250m when they won the Mega Millions draw in March 2007. 
However, the prize was shared with an anonymous truck driver 
from Georgia.

A single 
ticket claimed by eight co-workers from a Nebraska meat processing plant
 won £234m in February 2006. Larry and Nancy Ross from Michigan and Joe 
and Sue Kainz from Illinois shared the £232m jackpot from The Big Game 
in May 2000.

Yesterday afternoon Mrs Bull – who works in health insurance – said they
 were still so shocked they had not even told sons Joel, ten, and 
Declan, nine, about their good fortune.

Incredibly, the couple carried on with their weekend plans as normal, 
taking the boys to play in football matches and hosting a birthday 
sleepover.

The couple said their younger son would tell them off for buying lottery
 tickets. ‘He always tells me it’s a waste of money,’

Mrs Bull laughed. 
‘He might have something to say about that now.’

Mr Bull built his family’s six bedroom, six bathroom house in Mansfield himself.

The couple said it was already their ‘dream home’ and they did not want 
to move.

But they said they would consider buying a holiday home abroad –
 and would treat their boys to a family holiday in Disneyland Florida.

Mr Bull would like splash out on a box at Old Trafford to watch his 
beloved Manchester United.

The couple also want to support charities 
with their new-found millions, particularly breast cancer research.

Mr 
Bull’s mother Edith suffered with the disease around five years ago and 
has since recovered.

Last night, friends said the couple had ‘worked hard all their lives’ 
and deserved the money.  Neighbour Sam Giles, 42, said Mr Bull was a 
‘good, hard-working’ bloke.

Friend Della Needham, 37, described Mr Bull as a ‘devoted family man’ 
and Mrs Bull as a fitness fanatic.

She added: ‘‘I’m just really happy it
 has happened to such a good couple.’
