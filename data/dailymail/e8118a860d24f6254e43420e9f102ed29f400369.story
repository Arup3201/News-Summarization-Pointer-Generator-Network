The Tennessee woman who ended her Russian adoption by sending the 7-year-old boy to Moscow on a plane by himself has lost her bid to get a judge to set aside an order that she pay child support.

Torry Hansen made her first court appearance today in a case that began in April 2010 when sent little Artyom Saveliev away from her home Shelbyville with a letter that said he had violent behaviour problems and she no longer wanted to be his mother.

‘He was very violent,’ she explained to the court. ‘He tried to kill me, he tried to start a fire,’ the former mother said.

Sent back: Artyom Savelyev, a 9-year-old Russian boy, was sent back to his native country by his adoptive U.S. mother and is now in a foster home in Tomilino, outside Moscow

Proceedings: Torry Hansen, right, sits with her attorney Ed Yarbrough today in Lewisburg, Tennessee; Hansen has lost her bid to get a judge to set aside an order that she pay child support

Hand-picked: Tennessee nurse Torry Hansen took a trip to Russia in 2009 
and met Artem in an orphanage. Their meeting is

Criminal charges were never filed but
the World Association for Children and Parents adoption agency sued 
Hansen for child support.

Circuit
Court Judge Lee Russell decided Friday to uphold the $150,000 in child 
support he ordered from Hansen, but Hansen can now choose to appeal his 
decision.

The boy now lives in a Russian group home.

parents

Hansen wants the California court to recognize the Russian decision.

Adoption advocates hailed the Tennessee court order as a measure of justice for the boy, and said the judge's decision would show there are consequences to abandoning adopted children.

Hansen apparently never told social workers that she was having problems with the boy.

The agency sued Hansen to deter others from doing anything similar and to show the Russians that 'you cannot do this in America and get away with it,' Mr Crain said.

'It has certainly caused concern on the part of Russian officials that unless there are consequences when a parent abandons a child placed in their home, there's a need for safeguards to make sure this never occurs,' he added.

The judge said in his order that when Hansen adopted the boy she signed a contract acknowledging that it was possible the child could have physical, emotional or behavior problems that were unreported and even unknown to the adoption agency.

Lee said $58,000 of the $150,000 will pay for the past two years' worth of support and medical fees for the boy in Russia.

Court documents say the boy was hospitalized for three weeks after he returned to Moscow, but they do not say what he was treated for. He was later moved to an orphanage and then sent to another institution.
