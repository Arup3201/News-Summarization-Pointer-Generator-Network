The Marvellous Map of Great British Place Names could be the perfect Christmas present sure to keep the family entertained and merry

Scotland has its fair share of somewhat interesting place names, from Foulpapple to Grogport, that may stir at least a chuckle 

The map took several months to research, as well as a fair amount of petrol as those behind the offering, Strumpshaw, Tincleton & Giggleswick, ensured they could confirm the legitimacy of the locations featured.

Britain has long had an association and fascination with funny place names, and now you can have them all in your very own mapped version. 

Boasting a wealth of bottoms you’ll also find the odd Crack, a Clench (Wiltshire) and even a Roger Moor (Lancashire). 

More commonly known as an archipelago off Cornwall, there is actually a Scilly Isles in Surrey -  a double roundabout between Esher and Kingston upon Thames.

There is a Jackass Lane in the south east of England, just below Willey Lane and east of Irons Bottom and Abinger Hammer

Many of the humorous place names are found in Wales; two particular highlights being Lord Herefords Knob and Booby Dingle

Handcock's Bottom, Sandy Balls and River Piddle can all be found in Dorset alone

Cheshire adds its own somewhat interesting place names with Bottom Flash, Andrew's Knob and Winterbottom making the map

The first and most comprehensively researched map of its kind, the Marvellous Map of Great British Place Names is available in a selection of prints in either a classic or deluxe (personalised) edition.

It contains 1,400 funny, strange, slightly rude and just plain silly place names showcasing a spectrum of emotions (Seething, Corney, Lusty), personal qualities (Loose, Idle, Ugley), varieties of underwear (Pant, Undy, Netherthong) and quasi-expletives (Fulking Hill, Ruddy Carr, Great Heck).

There are villages named Willey in Shropshire and Warwickshire, as well as the parish in Herefordshire

Sandy Balls, situated in the New Forest, was named after the dome-shaped gravel and known as Sandyballas during the reign of Henry VII

The town of North Piddle, in rural Worcestershire, got its name from the old English word piddle referring to a marsh or fen, which, overtime lent its name to the nearby stream Piddle Brook

It also has an educational element, with a handy glossary and guide to the meaning of place names, explaining the origins of place names such as Middle Wallop (Hampshire) and Twatt (Orkney/Shetland).
