Brazil legend Pele has called his country a ‘disgrace’ for their poor planning ahead of next month’s World Cup.

There have been a number of delays to the completion of a number of the stadiums as well as widespread theft and corruption in the lead up to the tournament.

But the three time World Cup winner condemned the protesters ahead of the tournament.

Concerns: Pele has been critical of the preparations in Brazil for the World Cup

He said: ‘There has been significant time to get the stadiums finished.

‘The situation is unacceptable – it is a disgrace. The political situation is difficult.

‘Our team has nothing to do with the ongoing corruption that has delayed construction of the stadiums.

‘It is not the problem of the players but the situation worries me a great deal. The evil people who have stolen all the money are to blame. Protests against corruption are understandable – but not the use of the force.’

Prediction time: Pele says both Spain and Germany have a good chance

Ahead of the tournament -which kicks off on June 12 – Pele believes hosts Brazil have a good chance but has also says Spain have a good chance to retain their crown.

He said: I hope Brazil win it, but for me the two teams in Europe are Germany and Spain.

‘Spain have played outstanding football for a number of years. Germany are well organised and favour a very attacking style – they almost play a more Brazilian way than us.’
