A California teen says her school tormentors followed her home and attacked her in front of her family after viciously bullying her. 

The brutal fight between Adayja Lowery and several teenage girls in Stockton last week was caught on camera and has not been shared on social media across Cesar Chavez High School. 

The 16-year-old says she's now afraid to go back to school.

The video shows Adayja taking the first swing. She says she was fed up with the bullying. However, she quickly was overwhelmed by her attackers

Adayja's sister was also pulled into the fight

'I am supposed to feel safe at school, but I didn’t feel safe.I contacted my mom because I was hearing that I was going to be jumped by this girl and her sister,' she told KTXL-TV. 

The video shows Adayja taking the first swing at the girl who seemed to be leading the mob that had gathered outside her house. 

She says she was tired of being bullied. 

Quickly, Adayja was pulled into a scrum of punching, screaming and hair-pulling by the mob of teenage girls.

When her eighth-grade sister tried to intervene, she was drawn into the fight and beaten, too. 

Finally, Adayja's mother Alicia Henderson intervened to stop the violence. 

'If a situation like this happens and they are at home, I’m not sending them to school,' she said. 

The two girls escaped with minor scratches and bruises.  

School officials responded by suspending Adayja and her sister for the fight. 

However, the school district police department is investigating the fight and could bring criminal charges against the students involved. 

Alicia Henderson, Adayja's mother, says she doesn't want her daughters to go back to school if they aren't even safe in their own homes
