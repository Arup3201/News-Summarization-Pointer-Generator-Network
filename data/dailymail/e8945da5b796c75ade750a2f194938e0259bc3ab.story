Google has revealed a mobile phone with a built in 3D scanner that could revolutionise navigation.

Called Project Tango, the phone can build up a live 3D map of its surrounding area.

It will initially only be sold to developers, who Google hope will develop everything from satnav apps to games similar to those found on Microsoft's Xbox, which uses the 3D Kinect sensor..

Google's prototype phone - a 5inch handset packed with 3D sensors

The handset can automatically build a 3D map of anywhere the user is, allowing for far better indoor navigation

The current prototype is a 5” phone containing customized hardware and software designed to track the full 3D motion of the device, while simultaneously creating a map of the environment.

These sensors allow the phone to make over a quarter million 3D measurements every second, updating it’s position and orientation in real-time, combining that data into a single 3D model of the space around you.

'Project Tango strives to give mobile devices a human-like understanding of space and motion through advanced sensor fusion and computer vision, enabling new and enhanced types of user experiences – including 3D scanning, indoor navigation and immersive gaming,' said Johnny Lee, the technical lead on the programme.

The handset can take 250,000 3D measurements a second

It was created by Motorola's ATAP division, which last week joined Google.

'The goal of Project Tango is to give mobile devices a human-scale understanding of space and motion,' it said.

The phone has a compass and gyros, just like any other phone, but in addition, has Kinect-like visual sensors that can scan the room around the phone.

In its announcement, Google asks: 'What if you could capture the dimensions of your home simply by walking around with your phone before you went furniture shopping? What if directions to a new location didn’t stop at the street address? What if you never again found yourself lost in a new building?'

How it works: depth sensing and motion tracking sensors allow the handset to know exactly where it is, and it can create a 'live' 3D map of its surroundings.

The team has spent over a year on the project, operating in secret from Motorola's HQ.

'The team has been working with universities, research labs, and industrial partners spanning nine countries around the world for the last year to harvest research from the last decade of work in robotics and computer vision, concentrating that technology into a unique mobile phone.

'Now, we’re ready to put early prototypes into the hands of developers that can imagine the possibilities and help bring those ideas into reality.'

The firm believes gaming could be one of the first uses of the system.

'Imagine playing hide-and-seek in your house with your favorite game character, or transforming the hallways into a tree-lined path. Imagine competing against a friend for control over territories in your home with your own miniature army, or hiding secret virtual treasures in physical places around the world?'
