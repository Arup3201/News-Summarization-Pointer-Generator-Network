A woman arranged for her ex-partner to be kidnapped and killed and then had sex with one of the hitmen shortly after they dumped his body in remote bushland, a court has heard.

Robyn Jane Lindholm, 41, is charged with the murder of Melbourne gym owner Wayne Amey, whose body was found wedged between boulders at Mt Korong in central Victoria last December.

The pair were in a relationship that had turned sour and were due in court over a property dispute on the day he disappeared.

Chief Crown Prosecutor Galvin Silbert told Melbourne Magistrates Court on Monday that Lindholm had engaged two men - Torsten Trabet, 45, and John Anthony Ryan, 37 - to kill Mr Amey.

Two other men had repeatedly declined her requests.

Mr Silbert said one of the men who refused to take part had warned Mr Amey, who subsequently went to police in August 2013 and told them of Lindholm's intent to harm him.

Mr Amey was ambushed in the car park of his apartment block, where he was bashed with a baseball bat, tasered and thrown into a car boot and driven off, according to Mr Silbert.

He told the court Mr Amey could be heard pleading for his life before he was stabbed a number of times and strangled.

Mr Silbert alleged that after the three dumped Mr Amey's body between two boulders and covered it with sticks and rocks, Ryan left the other two.

Lindholm and Trabert then went to a secluded spot in nearby Kyneton where they had sex, before they returned to Melbourne.

The court heard Mr Amey suffered stab wounds, fractured ribs and neck injuries and was wrapped in a canvas sheet with rope around his neck and his lower legs hog tied.

Lindholm, Trabert and Ryan all deny murder.

Lindholm and Trabert are also contesting charges of intentionally causing serious injury and assisting an offender.

The committal hearing continues.
