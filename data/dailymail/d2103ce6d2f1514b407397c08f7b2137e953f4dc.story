A 45-year-old Missouri elementary school sports coach has been arrested and charged with first degree murder after police confirmed the body of a missing ten-year-old girl was found.

Craig Michael Wood, 45, is accused of murdering Hailey Owens on Tuesday after police descended on his Springfield home following the little girl's abduction in broad-daylight.

Witnesses described seeing a white man in his 40s circle Owens as she walked home, jump out of his gold Ford Ranger and drag her inside on Tuesday afternoon.

Hailey Owens: Witnesses say a man grabbed Hailey from in front of a neighbor’s home and drove away in a gold 2008 Ford Ranger Tuesday afternoon

Charged: Craig Michael Wood, 45, was taken into custody on Tuesday night, about three hours after Hailey Owens was abducted from a street near her Springfield home

Wood, 45, was taken into custody on Tuesday night, about three hours after Hailey Owens was abducted from a street near her Springfield home.

According to local news reports the family of the 10-year-old have confirmed that Hailey's body has been found - but police have not yet confirmed where.

In an early morning news conference, Springfield Police Chief Paul Williams said that Wood is being held on suspicion of first degree murder and that the FBI is searching his home and his Ford Ranger.

'The FBI sent their evidence response team down last night and they are assisting us with processing the crime scene at East Stanford St.,' said Williams at 6am on Wednesday morning.

Williams declined to answer questions at the news conference this morning and did not provide any information on the condition of Hailey's body.

Witnesses told investigators that a man in a gold-colored 2008 Ford Ranger drove down the street several times before approaching Hailey and pulling her into his truck around 5 p.m. Tuesday

Police located Wood about 8:30 p.m. in his vehicle in his driveway at 1538 E. Stanford, where he lives.  

Approximately 35 police and FBI arrived at his home to search his property and his Ford Ranger.

Police said they also found evidence of foul play in the area but offered no other details.

Witnesses told police they saw a man — matching Wood’s description — abduct her near her home in the 3200 block of W. Lombard Street shortly before 5 pm on Tuesday.

They said the man approached her, asked her for directions and then pulled her into a 2008 gold Ford Ranger with Missouri tags 1YF454 or 1YS454.

A witness, Carlos Edwards, told a News-Leader photographer he saw the girl being abducted as he and his wife sat in the garage of their home.

Investigation: Police have not officially confirmed that Hailey's body has been discovered at Craig Michael Wood's home - but their investigation is centered only on his property and his Ford Ranger

Edwards said the suspect drove up and down the street several times before pulling up alongside the girl and asking her if she knew the location of Springfield Street before grabbing her.

Edwards said he tried to run after the truck as his wife got the license number and called 911.

A Springfield Public Schools employee database shows that Craig M. Wood was first employed in August 1998 as a paraprofessional for in-school suspension.

A salary list published by the district for this year shows he was still working in that role and as a coach and made $17,220 last year at Pleasant View Middle School.

Hailey is a student at Westport Elementary School and last year she attended Bowerman Elementary School.

Springfield Public Schools Superintendent Norm Ridder released the following statement:

'Last night we learned the terrible news that one of our students had been abducted near her home. This morning, our sadness is compounded by the recent developments in the case of Hailey Owens’ abduction.

Sad: The witness reports triggered a multi-state Amber Alert, Springfield police said on Wednesday. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation canceled a statewide Amber Alert for Owens and reported on their website on Wednesday that at 7 a.m. local time, Springfield police 'announced that they had a suspect in custody and that (Hailey) was deceased.'

'The suspect in this case, Craig Michael Wood, was arrested by Springfield Police Department. Wood has been employed by SPS since Aug. 18, 1998.

'He works as a paraprofessional and athletic coach at Pleasant View K-8 School. His employment has been suspended until this matter is resolved.'

Initially, Hailey's abduction triggered a multi-state Amber Alert, Springfield police said on Wednesday.

The Kansas Bureau of Investigation canceled a statewide Amber Alert for Owens and reported on their website Wednesday that at 7 a.m. local time, Springfield police "announced that they had a suspect in custody and that (Hailey) was deceased."

A KBI spokeswoman confirmed that the website information was accurate.

Wood is being held in the Greene County jail on suspicion of first degree murder, according to the jail's online booking records.

On Tuesday, Hailey's mother said she was trying to stay strong.

'My nerves are shot,' Stacey Owens said, about two hours after her daughter, was abducted.

Stacey said that she and her husband Jeff were trying to stay strong.
