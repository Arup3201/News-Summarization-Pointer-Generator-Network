Italian anaesthetist Danaje Ahmid Raza, 56, pretended to be paraplegic for three years after staging accident in his hospital

A 56-year-old doctor pretended to be paraplegic for three years after staging an accident in his hospital so he could secure a 1.2million euro (£888,441) payout.

Italian anaesthetist Danaje Ahmid Raza, 56, originally from Iran, faked falling down the stairs in 2012 and claimed the accident forced him into a wheelchair.

But suspicions were aroused when he was seen driving, renovating his villa, pushing a supermarket trolley and going to the bar with friends, Il Messaggero reported.

Police footage  captured him being pushed in his wheelchair before nimbly getting to his feet, placing his walking sticks in the boot and driving away.

The doctor claimed he suffered a loss of vision in his right eye and a severe pain in his spine and was awarded 1.2 million euro in compensation and a 5,000 euro a month lifetime pension.

But clinical tests revealed that the fraudster had not suffered any visible injuries to his spine and found his muscle tone was not altered in any way. 

Mr Raza was arrested by Turin police after a detention order was issued by prosecutor Antonio Rinaudo.

Il Messaggero said he was arrested: 'Because the man went to the bar with friends, carried weights, took care of the renovation of his villa, loaded a bag of cement on the trunk of the car, pushed the supermarket trolley and was always  sure-footed and agile.
