A construction crew was forced to remove their 'Men Working' sign at a community college in Ohio after it was described as 'sexist and non-inclusive.'

The builders were also made to stop working until the sign was removed.

A college administrator complained about the wording at Sinclair Community College in downtown Dayton.

'Sexist and non-inclusive'? A Men Working sign like the one at Sinclair College

The female employee complained about the sign and, according to Fox News, she also suggested several alternatives to the crew, such as 'Construction Zone.'

While builders complied with the demands, work was stopped until the sign was removed.

With nearly 30,000 students, Sinclair's main site is one of the largest community college campuses in North America.

A statement on diversity on the institution's website states: 'The concept of diversity at Sinclair Community College encompasses the 
acceptance, inclusiveness, engagement, and mutualÂ respect among 
students, faculty, staff, administrators, and members of the broader 
community.'

After this incident, Sinclair's director of public information Adam Murka told Fox News that the college has a 'deep commitment to diversity' and takes it 'quite seriously.'

Murka added: 'While it may not have been necessary to suggest work be stopped, we stand by our commitment to providing an environment that is inclusive and non-discriminatory.'
