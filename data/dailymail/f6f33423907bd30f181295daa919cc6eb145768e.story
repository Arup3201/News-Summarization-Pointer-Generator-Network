A British artist turned his fascination with maps into art - by building maps of cities at key points in their history out of books and music set at the time.

Matthew Picton has built Second World War London and Coventry, 19th century Russia, and turn-of-the-millennium New York among his creations, which are based on each era's maps.

Singed and blackened paper represents scorched land at Ground Zero following the 9/11 attacks, in London during the Blitz and also following the Great Fire in 1666.

Elsewhere, vivid yellow paint brings to life the excitement of the Las Vegas strip while a quote from Tolstoy's War and Peace winds through the river of Moscow in a depiction of the city before the Napoleonic invasion in 1812.

Wartime London in the early 1940s has been recreated by Matthew Picton out of pages from books. He burned pieces of paper from Christopher Fowler's Full Dark House, a thriller set in the Blitz, to show the damage in Waterloo, left, while Clerkenwell, right, is made from Graham Greene's 1943 novel The Ministry of Fear

Coventry at the time of the 1940 bombings has been recreated using the sheet music for Benjamin Britten's War Requiem, which was commissioned for the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral in 1962. The lyrics were taken from First World War poems by Wilfred Owen and also form part of Matthew Picton's map

Picton used pages from novels by Graham Greene, Rosie Alison, Elizabeth Bowen and Christopher Fowler to show Second World War London following the bombing raids by German aircraft.

His technique of burning the paper where destruction was left injects the maps with character - making them seem more like an aerial view of the damage than just an outline of the streets and giving each city a sense of personality.

Another wartime-based creation shows Coventry after the city suffered its own Blitz, made of paper bearing the music for Benjamin Britten's War Requiem.

Britten composed the requiem for the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral, which was built next to the ruins of the one destroyed in the war.

In this paper sculpture, the German city of Dresden is recreated to show how it looked after it was bombed by Allies in February 1945

Britten's music and the lyrics, taken from work by First World War poet Wilfred Owen, form the walls and streets of Coventry in Picton's creation.

He also acknowledges the destruction at Dresden in 1945 left by Allied bombers, using burnt copies of the score to Wagner's Ring cycle and singeing the ground of the map to show where bombs landed.

Elsewhere, the artist turned to pages 
from Daniel Defoe's Journal of the Plague Years to make London in 1666, 
based on a map of the time of the Great Fire which began in a baker's 
and raged for days, destroying thousands of homes and St Paul's Cathedral, which went on to survive the Blitz.

His modern day work includes a dazzling 
Las Vegas, electrified by neon paint and made using pages of Hunter S 
Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, while a sculpture of lower 
Manhattan shows the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001.

Artist Matthew Picton created a 3D map of London in the time of the Great Fire in 1666 out of book covers of Daniel Defoe's A Journal of the Plague Year

The dark patch of scorched earth at the end of the island dominates the piece, which was built from newspaper headlines in the days following the hijacking of four planes, two of which hit the World Trade Centre's twin towers.

Pages from Philip Roth's The Plot Against America also made up blocks and buildings in the creation.

Picton was born in England, 
studied at the London School of Economics and is now based in Oregon in the United States.

He
told Dazed Digital: 'I think my interest in [maps] was born out of 
walking, the imagination of place that maps create in the mind and a 
long term fascination with travel, landscape and geography.'

1970s Las Vegas is depicted in vivid yellow paper torn from copies of Hunter S Thompson's 1971 novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Using the pages torn from Thompson's novel, depicting hedonism in Las Vegas, helped Picton in his mission to make maps seem more representative of the cities they show

Picton used pages of Thomas Mann's novella Death in Venice and the score of Benjamin Britten's opera to create a modern-day map of Italy's canal city

Picton's map of Saint Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, is created with clean lines of white, cream and blue

Saint Petersburg sits on the Neva River which gave artist Matthew Picton an interesting shape to work with

In this map of Moscow based on the damage from the 1812 fire, a quote from Tolstoy's War and Peace is carved into the Moskva river. 'The comet which was said to portend all manner of horrors and the end of the world', it reads. The rest of the piece is made from sheet music for Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture

Matthew Picton's maps go beyond a simple A-Z look at a city and give a sense of what it was like to be there
