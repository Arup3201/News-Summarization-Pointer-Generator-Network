Big day: Navy officer Richard Gray at his wedding in Cornwall in December

Arm-in-arm with his bride as they walk under a guard of honour, this is the Royal Navy officer who allegedly had an affair with Britain’s first female warship captain.

Just a month after his ‘perfect wedding’, Lieutenant Commander Richard Gray sailed into a sex scandal aboard HMS Portland.

The 35-year-old, who is third-in-command of the Royal Navy frigate, is accused of having an inappropriate relationship with Commander Sarah West, 42, its trailblazing skipper. 

As both officers face disciplinary action, photographs have emerged of Lt Cdr Gray’s fairytale white wedding to his bride Melissa, 33.

They married by the sea in Cornwall, gave guests hand-knitted crochet lobsters and posed for stunning pictures on the beach. 

The couple had a guard of honour from HMS Portland as they walked from the pretty 16th century St Enodoc’s Church in Trebetherick.

And the proud new Mrs Gray – who broke tradition to propose to her groom – even wrote about their special day for Perfect Wedding magazine. 

Yet they spent only five weeks of married life together before her husband departed for a seven-month tour of the Atlantic on HMS Portland.

Lt Cdr Gray is Portland’s operations officer, in charge of weapons and defence systems, and would have been one of the captain’s closest confidantes. 

But at his wedding, on December 6, 2013, he only had eyes for his bride. An aircraft engineer from Bristol, she wore Manolo Blahnik designer heels and a midi-length white dress.

She revealed in her Perfect Wedding article how she proposed during the leap year 2012 on February 29 – traditionally the one day when women can ask for their boyfriend’s hand in marriage.

She wrote: 'I proposed to Ritchie while he was away with the Navy.  As we were going to be apart, I had bought a card and written him a short note, which I hid in his bag.

And now the ship’s captain has been flown home in disgrace over claims of an affair with him. 

Divorced Cdr West could lose command of her vessel or even be sacked, two years after she made history by becoming the first woman in the Navy’s 500-year history to captain a frontline warship.

protecting and promoting national interests

 

'On the 29 February I got a phone-call at 6.30am - he had been up since 5am saying yes!' 

The couple organised a nautical-themed wedding, ‘an obvious choice as we both have a strong connection to the sea’, she said. 

The bride wrote that the ceremony was ‘incredibly personal, and saying our vows just felt like we were talking to one another’. 

She added: ‘I don’t think either of us had expected it to be quite so emotional and overwhelming’.

Before the wedding, she had shed tears of joy when she collected her silk satin organza bridal gown by designer Gilly Woo. 

‘I cried when I picked it up because I couldn't believe it was finished and looked so perfect,’ she said.

The wedding reception was held at The St Moritz, a £235-a-night luxury hotel close to the resort of Rock, beloved of royals and celebrities.

Mrs Gray wrote: ‘All our tables were named after the Shipping Forecast and our “favours” were lobsters adopted from the Padstow Lobster Hatchery. Each certificate of adoption was accompanied by crochet lobsters that I made for each guest.’

The bride and groom had had dance lessons to ensure their first dance was a success, and  

Last night Mrs Gray said she did not wish to comment on her husband’s alleged affair.

If the claims are proven, both officers may face serious consequences including having their service terminated. The Armed Forces’ Code of Social Conduct bars personnel from having relationships with subordinates if they compromise ‘operational effectiveness’.

When she was promoted in 2012, Cdr West revealed putting her career first had damaged her marriage to ex-Navy helicopter pilot Andrew Whitlum, 43, which broke down in 2006.
