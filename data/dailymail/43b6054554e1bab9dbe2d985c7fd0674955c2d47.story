One of the four Sydney bothers, who are believed to have flown to Syria to fight alongside the Islamic State, spent thousands of dollars on a future honeymoon and new furniture before he went missing.

Bassima and Issam El Baf, the parents of Taha, Hamza, Bilal and Omar from Yagoona in Western Sydney, have released an image of their four sons in an effort to locate them, and written to Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to plead for assistance in finding them.

Omar El Baf, who planned to marry and move in with his fiancé, paid $13,000 for his future honeymoon only a couple of days before he vanished in November, The Daily Telegraph reports. He also paid a deposit for furniture for their future home.

The four men, aged between 17 and 28, told their parents they were taking a holiday in Thailand after winning their tickets in a competition, before revealing via text message that they had arrived in Syria. 

Before they were due to come home last month, the parents received a text stating: 'We made it to Bilad al-Sham, we will see you in paradise'. 

Bilad al-Sham is a region in Syria. Despite the text, the parents went to the airport to pick up their sons but they never arrived. 

They now fear their boys have been lured into the clutches of the IS terrorist organisation.

Their father Issam El Baf said he hadn't heard anything since receiving the haunting text.

'It's bad, very bad,' he said. 'It's very frustrating. We haven't heard anything for three weeks.' 

Authorities tracked the sons down in Turkey after the family alerted them but it is believed they have since crossed the border into Syria. 

Unlike some before them, the siblings were 'clean-skins' and had not been on any watch-lists that would have alerted immigration controls.

In a statement last month, their mother pleaded with them to come home.

'My sons, you are dear to us. You are good at heart. You have done nothing wrong.

'Come back. We love you.'

Last month, leading Islamic community leader Dr Jamal Rifi told radio station2UE: 'The family is distraught, their main concern is to initiate contact, the concern are not concerned how they were radicalised but that they want them to come back. 

Dr Jamal Rifi said the brothers had not responded to messages and had probably had their mobile phones confiscated by IS

Dr Rifi said the family was trying to get messages to the brothers but they had not responded and had probably had their mobile phones confiscated by IS.

He explained the family had given all the information to the authorities who were trying to 'put the pieces of the puzzle together'.

Their mother is of Lebanese descent and their father is a taxi driver, they also have another brother and sister living at home. 

Dr Rifi added they were 'simple boys' who could not organise trip properly, and he revealed they had missed the first flight they had booked and had to re-book one for the next day.

He said: 'They have no life experience. They (the parents) had no idea what their kids were planning such a move, these are ordinary kids who live at home, they showed no sign of radicalisation.' 

The fifth son went to meet a flight that was coming in from Thailand last month, hoping it was a joke.

Dr Rifi said the family had alerted the authorities to the brothers' departure and it was now up to them to 'put the pieces of the puzzle together'.

More Australians have slipped through the cracks and fled overseas to join the fight with Islamic State

It emerged on Saturday authorities had tracked the brothers - who lived in south-west Sydney - as far as Turkey and alerted the family last week.

Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan told a parliamentary committee that the group of four that managed to leave the country this week were 'not on anyone's radar',The Guardian reported.

'We got wind of it after the fact, but the fact is there are still people travelling,' said Gaughan, the national manager of counter-terrorism for the Australian Federal Police,' he said.
