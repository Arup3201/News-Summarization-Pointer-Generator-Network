A rare Amur leopard mauled to death a female brought into his enclosure during a breeding attempt at a Pennsylvania zoo yesterday.

Edgar, five, grabbed Lina, seven, by the throat and attacked her in an off-exhibit area at Erie Zoo.

Zoo staff, who don't know what provoked the attack, tried to save Lina but she died from her injuries.

Erie Zoo executive director Scott Mitchell said his staff were 'devastated' by the tragic loss.

'This is a tough day...The veterinarian gave her (Lina) oxygen and 
took all the appropriate steps, but he (Edgar) had done enough damage that she 
wasn't able to survive the attack,' Mitchell told Erie Times-News.

'I've been at the zoo nearly 30 years and they've never had this happen before. This isn't just bad for us, it's bad 
for their species.

'We were very much hoping that this 
pair would produce cubs. Their genetics are such that they're one of the
 most valuable pairs in the country.'

Mitchell said the leopards had been paired before but there were no problems, and that yesterday's brutal attack wasn't the fault of handlers. Lina was in heat at the time of the attack.

'That's
 the typical process because they're less aggressive in full heat,' 
Mitchell said.

'We had staff there, a veterinarian, the whole bit. He, 
for one reason or another, attacked her.'

Tragic: Erie Zoo executive director Scott Mitchell said staff were devastated by the loss

The zoo is said to have one of America's top Amur leopard breeding programs. The big cat is listed as critically endangered.

Mitchell said Lina arrived at the zoo about six 
months ago from the Minnesota Zoo, while Edgar arrived about four 
years ago from Estonia.

Both are genetically significant because their 
genes are not well represented in the small population.

'That is always the scariest moment, 
when you first put animals together, regardless of whether it's the 
first time or fifth time,' Mitchell said.

'You hold your breath and hope everything goes 
well. In one second something can go wrong.'

Erie Times-News reports Edgar will 
continue to be on public exhibit, but the zoo is deciding whether to 
continue using him in the breeding program.

The Amur leopard is the most endangered member of the cat family, according to the zoo's website.

Amur leopards are native to Korea, Manchuria and Siberia. Males weigh between 80 and 190 pounds and females weigh 60 to 130 pounds.

The creatures are prized by poachers for their beautiful, spotted fur.
