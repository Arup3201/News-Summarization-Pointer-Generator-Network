The founder of Russia's most popular social network claims he has been fired and that the website is now under 'complete control' of two allies close to president Vladimir Putin.

Pavel Durov, dubbed the Russian Mark Zuckerberg, was head of VKontakte, the country's version of Facebook.

But announcing his dismissal on his Vkontakte page yesterday, Mr Durov said the social network will now fall under state control and claims he only read about his sacking through reading it in the press.

In a statement he said: 'I was fired as general director of VKontakte.

'It’s interesting that the shareholders didn’t have the bravery to do this directly, and that I learned about my firing from the press.

He added: 'In this way, today VKontakte goes under the complete control of Igor Sechin and Alisher Usmanov.

'Probably, in the Russian context, something like this was inevitable, but I’m happy we lasted seven and a half years.

'We did a lot. And part of what’s been done can’t be turned back.'

The 29-year-old, is said to have refused previous attempts to censor VKontakte and has largely remained out of politics.

He is thought to have refused to shut down groups on the site, which were related to opposition leader Alexey Navalny and to anti-government protests in Ukraine

It was rumoured last year that Mr Durov was to leave the firm, and sell his stake in VKontakte, which boasts over 100 million users.

In January, he announced he had sold his 12 per cent stake in the firm and on April 1, he appeared to reveal that he was quitting the network.

But just two days later, he posted on VKontakte that he had had withdrawn his resignation, implying that it was an April fools' day joke.

Yesterday, the Russian news agency Interfax quoted the Vkontakte press service as saying Mr Durov tendered his resignation on March 21, and never officially withdrew it.

They added that as a month had passed, his resignation has now come into effect.

The network is now under control of Igor Sechin and Alisher Usmanov, both close allies to President Putin.

Mr Sechin is said to be one of Mr Putin's closest advisors and is the chief executive of state-owned oil company Rosneft.

He also served as deputy prime minister of Russia in Mr Putin's cabinet from from 2008 until 2012.

Mr Usmanov, ranked Russia's richest man, is a metals tycoon who expanded into technology and owned a 10 per cent stake in Facebook.

He has been steadily upping his stake in VKontakte recently and is also a major shareholder in Arsenal Football Club.
