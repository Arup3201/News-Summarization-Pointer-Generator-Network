A former Young Liberal  vice president has been forced to quit the party after it was revealed he was once involved with a neo-Nazi organisation.

Pictures have emerged of Scott Harrison making a 'Heil Hitler' Nazi salute at a skinhead event in 2010, while he's previously called on white people to carry firearms for intimidating 'racial enemies'.

Mr Harrison was the vice president of the Young Liberals in Geelong, 75km southwest of Melbourne, and was also active in campaigning for key marginal Liberal candidates, including Tony McManus in Lara and  Ron Nelson in Bellarine, both in south-western Victoria.

The Age reported on Wednesday that Mr Harrison had resigned from the Liberal Party after they learned of his former affiliation with neo-Nazis, and now more evidence has surfaced about his former affiliation with the movement.

An anti-fascist blog run by Andy Flemming  has released some of Mr Harrison's posts on neo-Nazi community websites, as well as the salute image, which comes from a gathering of the Hammerksins  group in 2010.

Mr Harrison, who works as an IT Support Technician, was also an influential figure in the Church of Creativity, another white supremacist Nazi group founded in the 1970s.

He was vocal on forums such as Stormfront, which was linked to a spate of anti-Semitic hate mail in Sydney that made news around the world. 

In an article for the Church magazine, Mr Harrison alleged that the Port Arthur massacre, the deadliest shooting in the history of the English speaking world, was 'another jewish lie'.

He also claimed 'it should be a key objective of Creators to awaken the White race to the realities of the Port Arthur massacre and the need for White people to remain armed and dangerous in the eyes of our racial enemies'.

Mr Harrison initially joined the white-supremacist forums in 2005, in the wake of the contentious Cronulla riots. He posted hundreds of militarist messages under various pseudonyms.

Mr Harrison had resigned from the Liberal Party after the party had learned of his six-year affiliation with the neo-Nazi movement, which included being an influential figure in the Church Of Creativity movement

Hate mail posted in letterboxes of the eastern suburbs of Sydney. The notes were tied to the white supremacist forum Stormfront, which Mr Harrison  used for half a decade before joining the Young Liberal party

In one post on Stormfront, he joked about images of of a female concentration camp.

'They are celebrating the girls graduation from Jewish strangulation school? Haha, jokes, haha!', he wrote.

In another vile message, under the pseudonym HatemongerCA, Mr Harrisson called on all Caucasian people to join the white supremacist cause.

'History has shown us that the White Race is responsible for all that which we call progress on this earth call upon you to join with us today, to do what is right for your family and for your extended family.'

Liberal state director Damien Mantach said in a statement 'the Liberal Party was unaware of Mr Harrison's previous affiliations.

'He has now resigned from the Party, effective immediately. 

Mr Harrison told The Age he had denounced his former views in 2010.

 'I completely distance myself from my past ideology. I now realise how insane it was. I now believe in racial equality and gay marriage,' he said. 

Opposition scrutiny of government spokesman Martin Pakula said Mr Harrison's views may have breached racial vilification laws.

He told reporters that while  people make mistakes in their youth, 'I think being a neo-Nazi is in a different category.' 

Daily Mail Australia has been unable to contact Mr Harrison.
