An experimental surgery that implants an electronic device into the brain of people that are profoundly deaf to stimulate an awareness of sound has allowed a little boy in Canada to hear things for the time.

And watching the moment that three-year-old Auguste Majkowski responds to music for the first time is sure to melt your heart.

The Montreal toddler was born deaf but only properly diagnosed at 18-months-old.

Doctors initially gave him bilateral cochlear implants, but following the surgery and six months of therapy, Auguste did not respond whatsoever, according to Fox News.

Profoundy dead: Auguste Majkowski, 3, from Montreal, was given cochlear implants in both ears after he was diagnosed as at 18-months-old, but they did not work

Smart: Afer his mother Sophia Gareau (left) saw on Facebook that a child in North Carolina had received a brainstem implant to help him hear, she went about researching

Ready to go: In May, Auguste underwent brain surgery as part of a six-hour procedure to implant the ABI device

It wasn't until his mother, Sophie Gareau, stumbled across a viral video on Facebook featuring a deaf patient who had undergone a new procedure and began to hear again.

The video showed North Carolina toddler Grayson Clamp hearing his father's voice for the first time.

The surgery, an auditory brainstem implant (ABI), has only been performed about 1,000 times.

Gareau began researching and believed her son was an ideal candidate.

She tracked down the team of doctors in California who performed the operation.

After a successful six-hour bran surgery in LA in May, Auguste has slowly been introduced to some sounds.

But his biggest breakthrough to date was at a recent family gathering when he began - much to the marvel of his parents - to react to music.

Dance time: Auguste jumps to his feet as the song, Ma Baker by Boney M., comes through the stereo

As the song, Ma Baker by Boney M., comes through the stereo, the look on Auguste's face is priceless.

He immediately jumps up and begins to dance.

'It was an amazing moment ... I have shivers just thinking of that moment,' Mrs Gareau told Fox News.

'And we're really hoping that we'll get more with time.'

Auguste's hearing will hopefully improve with time, however he will always be dead.

His doctors in LA will continue to turn up the volume of his implant hoping that sounds will become clearer for him.
