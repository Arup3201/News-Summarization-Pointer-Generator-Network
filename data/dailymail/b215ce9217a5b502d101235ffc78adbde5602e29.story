Must accept: A partial list of the permissions demanded fro the users by the app. These were enough to discourage rapper Killer Mike from downloading

Despite being named after the landmark document securing expanded liberties for free men in England, Jay-Z's new album thwarts modern-day technological freedoms.

An essay by Jon Pareles in the New York Times Friday detailed the odious process of downloading Jay-Z's 'Magna Carta Holy Grail' album on a Samsung phone, and all of the privacy settings listeners would have to give up in order to listen to it.

Samsung bought one million copies of Jay-Z's latest album to release to certain Samsung device owners three days before the actual release. 

In
order to receive the first downloads, all you needed to do was download
the Android App 'JAY Z Magna Carta' from the Google app store.

But then a pop-up lists all of the app permissions you must accept in order to listen to the album. 

By downloading the app you agree to 
let it modify or delete items in the storage on your phone and access 
your location on GPS. It also gathers information on the email addresses
and social media accounts associated with your phone.

The
app requires Facebook and Twitter logins because, as one Jay-Z 
spokesman said, 'We would like fans to share the content through social 
networking sites.'

Emails and phone calls to Samsung's public relations team were not immediately returned to MailOnline.

Rapper Killer Mike saw the all of the permissions requests and tweeted his response to it.

'I read this and ..."Naw I'm Cool"'

HOVA is watching you: The app needed to access a pre-release of Jay-Z's new album demands access to a lot of personal information

One of the features advertised around the release was that users would be able to read the lyrics to the new songs on the app.

It's a little more complex than that. Users must unlock lyrics by posting on Facebook or Twitter.

The
formatted post is 'I just unlocked a new lyric 'Crown' in the Jay Z 
Magna Carta app. See them first. http://smsng.us/MCHG2 #MagnaCarta' You 
could change the wording but you had to post or no lyrics. And it isn't
a one-time thing. You have to post every time you want to see lyrics 
for a song.

'Frankly, a
lyric that is going to show up almost immediately on the internet 
isn't much of a bribe for spamming your friends,' Pareles wrote.

Pareles
finds this broad-access to personal information inconsistent with 
Jay-Z's brand, as the rapper has written lyrics for years expressing 
paranoia about the authorities

Song spam: The app which allowed certain Samsung users to download the new Jay-Z albums days before the actual release demanded social media logins and users had to post on Twitter or Facebook to view song lyrics

'If
Jay-Z wants to know about my phone calls and e-mail accounts, why 
doesn't he join the National Security Agency,' Pareles questioned.

But the privacy setting weren't the only failures in the app yesterday.

Pareles said it took more than an hour for the download to become available to him.

'Jay-Z's sponsors at Samsung proved themselves not only intrusive, but technically inept,' he wrote.
