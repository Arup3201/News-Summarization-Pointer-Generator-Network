A 12-year-old boy who was signed up when he was aged one and a stay-at-home mom with four guns are just two of the members that make up the National Rifle Association.

With over five million members the NRA showcased a broad mix of attendance at the 2013 NRA Annual Meeting this weekend.

The nation's leading advocate for gun ownership is keen to show that it is not just men that own firearms and oppose gun-control efforts, saying female membership is up.

Leaders of the influential gun rights 
group, told members that the fight against gun control legislation is 
far from over, but they vowed that none in the organization will ever 
have to surrender their weapons.

asserted that they are in their fight for the long haul and have not 
been disheartened by last month's defeat of a bill that would have 
expanded background checks for gun sales.

The National Rifle Association 
convention comes as debate over gun control legislation in the U.S. has 
reached a fever pitch in the wake of December's mass shooting at Sandy 
Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 20 young 
children and six educators were killed.

The NRA had a major victory regarding
 gun control last month when an expanded background checks bill 
supported by President Barack Obama and other lawmakers in response to 
the Connecticut shooting failed to pass in the Senate.

But the group lost ground in some 
places as several states passed laws expanding background checks and 
banning large ammunition magazines.

On display:  Vintage handguns are displayed. More than 70,000 people attended the NRA's 3-day annual meeting that featured nearly 550 exhibitors, a gun trade show and a political rally

Vow: Leaders of the National Rifle Association, an influential gun rights group, told members that the fight against gun control legislation is far from over

Defeat: Proponents of gun control also asserted that they are in their fight for the long haul and have not been disheartened by last month's defeat of a bill that would have expanded background checks for gun sales

During a fiery and defiant speech 
Saturday, Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, the public face of 
the NRA, said the 'political and media elites' have tried to use Sandy 
Hook and other recent shootings 'to blame us, to shame us, to compromise
 our freedom for their agenda.'

He said the proposed bill 'got the 
defeat that it deserved' and that the measure would do nothing to 
prevent the next mass shooting.

'We will never surrender our guns, 
never,' LaPierre told several thousand people during the organization's 
annual member meeting, which is part of the yearly NRA convention being 
held this weekend in Houston.

Acres of 
displays of rifles, pistols, swords and hunting gear could be found 
inside the convention hall.

James Porter, the incoming NRA 
president, said Obama's gun control efforts have created a 'political 
spontaneous combustion' that has prompted millions of Americans to 
become first-time gun owners and created a national outrage that will 
manifest itself in next year's midterm elections.

'The Senate and House are up for grabs,' Porter said during Saturday's meeting.

'We can direct this massive energy 
of spontaneous combustion to regain the political high ground. We do 
that and Obama can be stopped.'

LaPierre said the NRA now has a 
record 5 million members, but he urged for increased membership and 
added that it 'must be 10 million strong' in its battle against gun 
control.

Meanwhile, across the street from the
 convention, advocates of expanded background checks and other gun 
control measures vowed to continue their fight.

Kellye Bowman of the Houston chapter 
of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a national grassroots 
effort promoting gun control that was started after the Sandy Hook 
shooting, said her organization was not discouraged by last month's 
failure of the gun control bill. She said its defeat actually increased 
her group's membership.

Bowman, who described herself as a 
fifth generation Texan who grew up shooting guns, said her group's 
primary focus now is meeting with legislators and supporting those who 
agree with their efforts and using the ballot box to remove those that 
don't.

'We can turn any mom into an 
activist. They need to start listening to us,' said Bowman, who was 
among more than 60 protesters who had gathered Saturday afternoon across
 the street from the convention.

Many of the protesters held up signs that read: 'Texans For Smart Gun Regulations' and '90% Want

A Background Check,' a reference to 
recent polls that have shown that up to 90 percent of Americans are in 
favor of expanded background checks.
