Crystal Palace rounded off a promising pre-season with a solid but unspectacular performance against German side Augsburg.

Tony Pulis' men bounced back well after conceding three times against Brentford in their last game, their only defeat of the summer, but were unable to break down the resilient Bundesliga outfit.

Augsburg finished eighth in the German top flight last season, and so proved a real test for the South Londoners, who travel to the Emirates Stadium to face Arsenal next week in their Premier League opener.

But Pulis' men were more than up to the challenge, keeping a clean sheet and even having the better of the game's limited chances, in particular when the second half substitute Dwight Gayle turning in a Glenn Murray cross before being correctly brought back for offside. 

Challenging trip: Marouane Chamakh battles Daniel Baier for the ball as Palace ended their pre-season

Frustration: Pulis gives orders to his men but they were unable to break down the organised Germans
