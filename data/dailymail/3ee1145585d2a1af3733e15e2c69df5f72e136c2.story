Two boys who became trapped after a plow operator pushed snow over them say they tried calling out for help, but rescuers were unable to hear them, leaving them trapped for hours.

Cousins Jason ‘J.J.’ Rivera, 9, and Elijah ‘Papito’ Martinez, 11, survived under the snow thanks to a pocket of air, and were only rescued after police noticed a boot sticking out of the snowdrift.

The two boys struggled to free themselves after a passing snow plow caught them by surprise and buried them while they built a snow fort.

The pair managed to stay alive thanks to an air pocket and the fact they helped each other to stay awake.

'We motivated each other to not go to sleep, keep yelling, keep moving our bodies, trying to break out,' said Elijah. 

'Cause I knew if we would've fallen asleep ...we probably wouldn't have woke up because we would be so cold, frozen probably.'

'I was punching everything,' said Martinez. 'I was moving my shoulders, banging my head, moving everything so I could get more space.'

'If I could've sat up, I could've got my legs out, and we could've at least made more space, but there was a big block of ice on my chest, so I couldn't move,' explained Rivera.

Authorities said the boys' parents became alarmed when they didn't come home from playing around 10 p.m., and after a fruitless search called police around 11:50 p.m. on Wednesday.

Officials finally found the boys around 2 a.m. on Thursday, after an officer saw a shovel half buried in the snow bank.

'After I saw the shovel, I just felt compelled to dig,' said 28-year-old Brandon Rola, a member of the Newburgh police force for 7 years, to FOX News. 

'I really didn't put it together, but I just started digging.'

Accident: Authorities said a snow plow operator had been clearing a parking lot by pushing snow over, and didn't see the boys on the other side of the pile

Rescue: A neighbor captured cell phone footage of the police and others frantically digging the boys out of the snow at 2 a.m. on Thursday morning

Snowdrift: The boys had been building their fort in an area of the nearby Family Health Center in Newburgh, New York, and a shovel they left behind tipped off rescuers

The officer took the shovel and started to dig. Others joined in, some digging with bare hands.

When police found the boot, they called for paramedics, fearing they may have arrived too late. That is, until another officer, John Maguire, saw the boot start to twitch.

'When John saw that, we just started digging like crazy,' Rola said. 'But we only had the one shovel, and you're talking about a 7 or 8-foot snowpile.'

'We knocked on doors, got shovels, and pretty soon, we had maybe 10 people working on that pile.'

'The cop saw our shovel got buried, he started digging twice and he hit my foot, and I'm like, "Papito somebody hit my foot, so yell."'

'We kept yelling, "Keep digging, keep digging. We're in here." So he kept digging.' 

The rescuers finally reached the two boys, who were suffering from exposure but still conscious after being trapped for around four hours unable to move their arms or legs. 

'All I see was the feet,' Takiaya Stevens, a neighbor who helped with the digging, told USA Today.

'When I got over there, the little boy's feet was hanging out of the thing, and he was shaking, and his mother was like, "It's all right,"' Stevens added. 'He was like, "Mommy, mommy."'

'They were probably in about five feet of snow,' Newburgh police Sgt Aaron Weaver told CBS New York. 'But however it fell, there was, like, a dome around their heads, so there was air in there, like space for them.'

Weaver, who was among the rescuers, said the dome of air was the only thing that saved them.

Both the victims were recovering on Thursday night at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla. Family members said they are in a good condition and can look forward to a Thanksgiving meal when they're released.

After getting some much-needed rest, Rola woke up to a Thanksgiving with his own family, conscious of the dramatic rescue hours before. 

'It was a good day,' said Rola.
