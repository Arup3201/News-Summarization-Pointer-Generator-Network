This is the amusing moment when a young couple stunned their family and friends when they did the ice bucket challenge on their wedding day

Amy Jarmain, 24, and husband Charlie, 21, from Staffordshire, were cheered on by guests as they got drenched to raise money for charity moments after tying the knot.

They surprised their guests by announcing they were going to do the popular challenge after their ceremony on Saturday.

Taking the plunge: Amy and Charlie Jarmain are doused in icy cold water during their reception

Before the deluge: The happy couple hope that others will now follow their example

The couple were then doused in ice-cold water as they sat on two wooden chairs outside the Wheatsheaf Inn in Onneley, Staffordshire.

Mrs Jarmain, who has two children from a previous relationship, wore her £450 dress and veil for the challenge while her groom was wearing his wedding suit complete with tie and waistcoat.

Now the blushing bride has revealed that their efforts have raised £180 for the Motor Neurone Disease Association.

'We were nominated to do the challenge by my sister-in-law Joanne the day before we got married,' she added.

'We kept it a surprise from the guests so they only found out when my brother Stephen announced it during his speech.

'Some people told me I was mad to do it in my wedding dress but I was only going to wear it once so I didn’t mind.

As guests counted down, Mrs Jarmain, still in her veil, was soaked with icy water by sister-in-law, Joanne White, 35, leaving her to spend the rest of the wedding with wringing wet hair.

Although she did bring a change of clothes, she says she was left uncomfortably cold. 'Everyone said they couldn’t believe I went through with it but I said I was going to do it so I did,' she added.

The couple now hope their example will by followed by other brides and grooms. 'I want to thank everyone who donated money on the day,' said Mr Jarmain, a supermarket worker, 'and I would definitely recommend the challenge to all couples who are getting married.

'Amy didn’t actually tell me about she was planning for us to do it on our wedding day so I only found out during the speeches. I was really surprised she was willing to do it in her dress but I was happy to go along with it. 

'Unfortunately that meant I didn’t have a change of smart clothes so I had to get changed into a pair of joggers afterwards.

'We had no idea we would be doing something like this on our wedding day. Everyone had a great time though and it was all for a good cause. 

Mrs White, who nominated the pair, added: 'It was really brave of Amy to do the challenge in her wedding dress.

'It is not something I would do but she was really up for doing it. The dress was completely soaked through so she had to leave it in a bathtub to let it dry.”

Mrs Jarmain, who works as a barista at Starbucks, met her husband 14 months ago and he proposed in November by hiding post-it notes around the house to create a treasure hunt.
