The boss of an exclusive Beverly Hills restaurant became so irate at customers who had booked a table but failed to show up, he decided to publicly shame them on Twitter.

Noah Ellis, co-owner of Red Medicine, tweeted the names of people who did not turn up for reservations on a busy Saturday night.

He said he resorted to Twitter-shaming the customers after losing 20 per cent of his 'prime-time bookings'.

Fury: Co-owner of Red Medicine Noah Ellis took to Twitter to vent his anger at 'no show' bookings

He started by writing: 'Hi **** ******** (323)Â  I hope you enjoyed your GF's B-day and 
the flowers that you didn't bring when you no-showed for your 8:15 
res'

This was followed by: 'Also big thanks to (names deleted) for no-showing betwn 7.30p-9.30p'

Before adding: 'All the nice guests who wonder why restaurants overbook and they sometimes have to wait for their res should thank people like those below.'

The tirade provoked a huge response 
on social networking sites and beyond with some coming out in favour of 
Mr Ellis' actions and others against.

Tirade: Mr Ellis named and shamed customers who failed to show for their reservation at his restaurant Red Medicine

Many
praised his stance saying customers' thoughtless behaviour deserved a 
public naming and shaming but others said it was over the line.

One suggested asked how he would feel if any of the bookings had been involved in some sort of accident.

'All of them?' was Mr Ellis' response.

Within hours of the tweets, several one-star reviews for Red Medicine were posted on the review site Yelp.

'Not showing is rude, though I get the feeling that this guy has a screw loose,' offered one critic.

Mixed reaction: Some praised the Twitter-shaming of 'no show' customers but others said it was a step too far

'You can pretty much guarantee that 
those people will not be coming back into your restaurant,' said Carrie 
Welch of Little Green Pickle, which handles publicity and promotions for restaurants in Portland, Oregon.

Other restauranteurs supported Red Medicine for highlighting a problem which has long vexed the catering industry and increased with the ease of online and email 
reservations.

'I take a lot of reservations, and I'd 
say at least 10 per cent don't show and don't call,' said Lenny 
Rosenberg, who runs a West Los Angeles eatery called Lenny's Deli.

It is not the first time Mr Ellis has attracted controversy for his tweeting. Two years ago he was so unhappy with Los Angeles Times food 
critic S. Irene Virbila's reviews that he posted her picture on Twitter 
so other restaurateurs would be able to see her coming.

He faced a similar mixture of hostility and praise for the stunt.

'We lost 20 percent of our total reservations on Saturday and a huge chunk of our prime-time bookings,' Mr Ellis said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. 'Most diners don't realize the impact no-shows make on a restaurant.'
