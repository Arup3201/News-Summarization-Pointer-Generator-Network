Irish Daily Star Editor Michael O'Kane has resigned in the wake of his decision to publish topless photos of Kate

The editor of the Irish Daily Star has resigned in the wake of the controversial publication of topless photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge.

Michael O’Kane had been suspended from his role in September while an internal investigation was carried out into the tabloid’s decision to run pictures of Kate and Prince William sunbathing on a private holiday in France.

In a statement yesterday the paper said: ‘As a result of the publication on September 15, issues arose with the shareholders of Independent Star Limited.

Having considered those issues, it is Mr O’Kane’s decision to resign as editor, effective immediately.’

Media tycoon Richard Desmond, whose Northern and Shell group co-owns the newspaper with the Irish-based Independent News and Media, had threatened to shut the Dublin operation down.

However, sources said today that shareholders were working to secure the future of the newspaper, which employs about 120 people.

It is understood there has been no change to the status of the 25-year-old joint venture on the back of Mr O'Kane's resignation.

One source said there would be ‘further changes’, which have still to be agreed and would be announced in the future. Another said there was no momentum behind calls to close the newspaper.

In September, Mr Desmond said he was 
very angry at the decision to publish the photographs and was ‘taking 
immediate steps to close down the joint venture’.

In a statement today, the Irish Daily 
Star said: ‘As a result of the publication on 15 September 2012, issues 
arose with the shareholders of Independent Star Limited.

‘Having considered those issues in 
tandem with Mr O'Kane, it is Mr O'Kane's decision to resign as editor of
the Irish Daily Star, effective immediately.’

Independent News and Media said Mr 
O'Kane acted at all times in a highly professional and appropriate 
manner and in the best interests of the newspaper.

Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge were said to be 'devastated' after the intimate snaps were taken

Furthermore, he followed all editorial policies and guidelines, the statement said.

It is understood the investigation into the publication of the photographs is ongoing.

The photos were taken while the couple were holidaying in September at Chateau d’Autet, a holiday retreat in Provence owned by the Queen’s nephew, Viscount Linley.

Prince William and Kate were said to be 
‘devastated’ after hundreds of intimate snaps were taken, showing her 
exposing her breasts and bottom on swimming pool terrace.

They were first published in French Closer magazine, and then in numerous other countries, including Italy and Ireland.
