They are extraordinary treasure troves, stuffed full of some of the greatest works of art that Britain has ever produced.

But the National Trust now wants its stately homes to have fewer exhibits – because they are too demanding on visitors.

The charity, which owns 500 historic homes and gardens, is worried that rooms often have ‘so much stuff’ it puts off all but the middle classes.

The National Trust, which owns 500 historic homes and gardens such as Cliveden House in Buckinghamshire, is worried that exhibitions often have ‘so much stuff’ it puts off all but the middle classes

In an attempt to try to broaden the appeal of Britain’s grand properties, bosses yesterday launched a ten-year strategy that includes plans to ‘simplify’ some exhibits.

Dame Helen Ghosh, director general of the National Trust, said simplifying the exhibits may be necessary.

‘We are making visitors work too hard in some places,’ she said

‘It’s not surprising given that where we have come from, that the type of places that we own are the places where the middle classes feel more comfortable, that it forms more of their cultural background.

‘Our analysis is that it isn’t the entrance fee that is putting people off, it is that they think this isn’t “the place for them” So how do we get them in?’

The Trust's director general Dame Helen Ghosh, said places like the Carrick-a-Rede bridge attracts visitors from all social classes

Dame Helen, who was Permanent Secretary of the Home Office until she was appointed to the Trust in 2012, said that some properties have a broader appeal.

‘When you go to somewhere like Carrick-a-Rede in Northern Ireland and watch people walking over the rope bridge, they are from every socio-economic background, wearing shorts, flip flops, all of that,’ she said.

But many of the large stately homes have a far narrower visitor base.

The Trust is to experiment with simplifying the exhibits at some of its properties.

Dame Helen said: ‘When it comes to our big grand houses one of the things we have to look at is the sheer number of exhibits. There is so much stuff in there.

‘Let’s not expect our visitors to look at every single picture in a room - let’ s pick one lovely thing, put it in the middle of the room and light it really well.

‘Let’s just have six or seven of those things dotted around that anybody would love - it’s not difficult.

‘We make people work fantastically hard - we could make them work much less hard.’

But she denied that the Trust is ‘dumbing down’ its approach in order to boost visitor numbers.

‘In many ways it is much more intellectually rewarding,’ Dame Helen insisted.

‘People will learn much more by looking at one object in a lot of detail, than they ever would going round a room getting a vague impression.’

Tim Parker, chairman of the Trust, added: ‘Every museum and gallery has the middle class problem.

‘We have serious aspirations to broaden our appeal - but the worst thing we can possibly do is to semi-condescend a group of people in order to a property seem more attractive.’

The National Trust is also putting a renewed emphasis on the great outdoors in the spirit of its founder Octavia Hill, who campaigned to provide open spaces for the poor.

As part of that goal it is working as a consultant body with councils in Sheffield, Manchester and Coventry, to look at new ways to maintain and fund urban parks.

The Trust hopes to use its experience in establishing endowments - the funding model that it uses to conserve many of its historic houses - to help set up new funding models for green city spaces.

Although the Trust is not putting in any money to the schemes, other charities such as the Heritage Lottery Fund and Nesta are also involved.

Mr Parker, a businessman who recently took over as chairman from outspoken journalist Sir Simon Jenkins, said outdoor space is a key way to broaden the Trust’s appeal.

‘The fantastic opportunity for the Trust is that we are not confined to buildings - we have lots of parks - people don’t have to go inside,’ he said.

‘We can do lots of things to make the whole offer that we have appeal not just to people who are in their 50s and 40s but people who are in their 20s and 30s as well. It is an age thing, not just a class thing.’
