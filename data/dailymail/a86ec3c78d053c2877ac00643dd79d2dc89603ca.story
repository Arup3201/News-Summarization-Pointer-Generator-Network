Frantic emergency calls made by students, panicked parents and teachers caught up in the Marysville-Pilchuck High School massacre have been released for the first time.

Five teenagers, including the perpetrator, were killed at the Washington state school on October 24 when popular freshman student Jaylen Fryberg opened fire at a group of friends.

The chilling audio clips include conversations between police officers and those who witnessed the mass shooting - including  teacher Megan Silberberger, who several survivors have described as a hero for trying to intervene and stop the 15-year-old's gun rampage.

In her panic-stricken call, Silberberger frantically tells the police operator: 'I'm in the cafeteria I have the shooter, one shooter...Blood is everywhere. I do not see the gun. I have him down.'

Lured: Jaylen Fryberg texted his five closest friends saying to meet him in the cafeteria where he shot them

During her frantic exchange with the dispatcher, Silberberger tries to describe the chaotic situation while students are heard screaming in the background

'I am looking at him…I need help. I need help now. Shooter, right here,' she says.

'He's wearing all black. I'm staring at him right now, sitting next to him. I need staff now. Shooter right here. Black pants, black shoes. Black pants, black shoes, black jacket,' she added.

'He is a high school student... I do not know who he is. I tried to stop him before he shot himself. He shot himself. He shot – many are down. I do not know how many are down,' Silberberger went on.

Four teenagers died from injuries sustained in the shooting. One student who was seriously hurt was released from the hospital last week. Jaylen Fryberg killed himself.

Students who fled the scene also reported the shooting to 911, describing how they dropped to the ground or bolted from the building.

'I just ran out of the school,' one student told the operator.

Only survivor: Nate Hatch was the only member of the group to recover from his injuries

Elsewhere a woman who lives next to the school - located about 30 miles north of Seattle - called to report that a group of students had climbed over her fence and were hiding at her house. 

She told the operator that several of the students had witnessed the shooting and asked how long they should stay inside. 

The operator advised her to hold tight until the police could arrive to interview them.

Parents who received calls or texts from their children were frantic for information. 

One father said his son just sent a text reporting shots fired. The operator confirmed that they knew about it but could not provide any additional information.

'Well, we're going down there,' the father said before hanging up.

Respect: Flowers, newspapers and written tributes are seen pinned outside Marysville-Pilchuck High School

Parents who received calls or texts from their children were frantic for information.

One father said his son just sent a text reporting shots fired. The operator confirmed that they knew about it but could not provide any additional information.

'Well, we're going down there,' the father said before hanging up.

A crying mother called to report a text from her daughter, but when the operator tried to comfort her by saying police were on the way, it didn't help.

'My daughter is not following lock-down directions and she and other kids have run from their classroom,' the woman said. 'She's away from her classroom right now. What advice can I give her?'

A food-service worker named Anne Haughian told the operator that she had just guided students out the cafeteria's side door. 

She said she saw a boy come in before the shots rang out, but did not see what happened next, adding 'it happened so fast.' Instead, she said she rushed the students out of the room to safety.

But one student was not with her. Her daughter.

'You're outside right?' the operator asked.

'Yes,' Haughian said. 'I'm trying to locate my daughter.'
