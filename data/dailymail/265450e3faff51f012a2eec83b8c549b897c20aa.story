A breast cancer survivor has just weeks to live after doctors missed four deadly tumours growing in her brain - despite her repeatedly asking for a scan.

Mother-of-two Lindsey Scrimshire, 52, claims that medics at Leicester Royal Infirmary took no action  after she complained of violent headaches in August 2011, following a battle with breast cancer.

Mrs Scrimshire, from Leicester, claims that despite repeated requests for a brain scan, she did not have one until last month, where it was revealed she had four cancerous tumours.

Lindsay Scrimshire, with husband Mark, has just weeks to live after doctors missed four deadly tumours growing in her brain. The mother-of-two has previously beaten breast cancer

She has now been left to plan her own funeral after being told she has just ‘weeks’ to live.

Mrs Scrimshire complained to a nurse she was suffering violent headaches in 2011 after she finished treatment for breast cancer, which included a lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Mrs Scrimshire said: 'I had severe headaches and pain down my shoulder - the side where the breast cancer was.

Mrs Scrimshire, 52, had been complaining of violent headaches since August 2011

'I asked if I should be scanned to check if it was cancer as I was worried, but she said it was not necessary.

'I was confused as to why I was not given a scan. The pain was such I went to see my GP regularly.'

The former customer services supervisor said she had an X-ray in October 2011 and was told by her GP she was suffering from arthritis and was given painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs.

Mrs Scrimshire went to Glenfield Hospital for her yearly cancer check-up in February last year.Lindsey said: 'Once again, I told the nurse about my violent headaches and pains.'

In the same month she saw her GP and was again told she was suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and given drugs.

She also went for an operation to remove a bowel blockage at Leicester Royal Infirmary.

Mrs Scrimshire said: 'I told them about my pain and worries but was told a scan was not necessary.'

She said she was finally scanned after she went into the accident and emergency department at the Leicester Royal Infirmary on April 22 because the pain was so bad.

Her husband, Mark, 47, said: 'A doctor came back with the results and she was crying. She told us Lindsey had four large tumours in her brain and there was nothing they could do but give her palliative care.

'Then a full body scan showed it is in her lungs and liver, too.

'If they had scanned Lindsey when she asked, nearly two years before, or even last year, she might have a chance of at least fighting the cancer.'

Mrs Scrimshire said: 'I asked and asked to be scanned but was repeatedly told that it would not be necessary. Staff should have listened to me, but I made the tragic mistake of listening to them'

Claire Esler, consultant oncologist and clinical head of service at Leicester’s Hospitals said: 'We are sorry that Lindsey did not receive a scan at her follow up appointment but it was felt at the time the symptoms were not related to the breast cancer.

'Our thoughts are with Lindsey and her family during this time and we have met with them to discuss the treatment options.

'Lindsay’s treatment for breast cancer back in 2011 was completely appropriate and under national guidance we do not scan patients after treatment. We are happy to meet again to discuss any of their concerns.'

Mr Scrimshire has consulted a solicitor and is considering legal action.
