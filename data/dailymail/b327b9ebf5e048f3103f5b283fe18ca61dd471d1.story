Police have released images of two teenagers they would like to speak to in connection with the murder of a 'well-known songwriter.'

Essex Police have taken the 'unusual step' of issuing the names and photographs of Jack Hummerstone, 18, from London, and Andre Vella, 19, from Frinton-on-Sea, and are urging anyone who knows anything about their whereabouts to contact police immediately.

Thomas Brittain, 26, from Essex, died after he was assaulted in the home of a friend, in a flat in Parkside Quarter, Colchester, at around 1.45am yesterday.

He received multiple stab wounds and the provisional result from the post-mortem examination carried out is that he died from a stab wound to the chest.

His family described him as a well-known songwriter and local music producer also known as Twister.

They said: 'He was a lovely, kind and funny man who will be dearly missed.'

Detectives issued CCTV pictures earlier today of the two men they want to question in connection with the stabbing.

The suspects are described as white 
men who were wearing hooded tops, tracksuit type clothing and with their
faces covered. They were both about 6ft tall and average build.

If anyone sees the men they are advised not to approach them but to contact Essex Police by calling 999.

DCI
Mark Hall, of Essex Police, said: 'We have decided to take the unusual 
step of issuing the names and pictures of these two individuals at this 
early stage as we believe it is vitally important we speak to them. Our 
message to these two men is this: "You should hand yourselves in at the 
nearest police station as soon as possible".'

The victim was rushed to Colchster's General hospital after his shocked friends phoned emergency services.

Mr Brittain was also the subject of a suspected abduction only four months ago when he was bundled into a black Ford Mondeo and driven away in Colchester.

After being reported missing, Mr Britain phoned police the next day to confirm he was safe and well.

Dangerous: Police described two men who forced their way into the property as 'dangerous individuals', saying that they were carrying a knife and a handgun

Essex police said officers are 'aware of other information in the public domain'.

The suspects pictured in CCTV images, both described as six feet tall and of average build, were seen leaving the flat before getting into a nearby Ford Focus.

Both individuals wore hoods and tracksuits while their faces were covered. The incident took place at around 1:45am on Saturday morning.

Essex Police's Detective Chief Inspector Mark Hall said: 'These men forced their way into a flat where the victim was staying, armed with a knife.

'One of the men was also in possession
of a handgun. They violently assaulted and killed the victim who was 
unable to defend himself; as such I consider them to be very dangerous 
individuals.

'It is vital that they are identified
and arrested as soon as possible. They should not be approached, but I 
urge anyone who recognises them to contact police immediately on 101.'

It is believed the men fled the property via riverside path that runs behind Charles House before leaving in a dark Ford Focus parked in St Peter's Street.

Detective Hall added: 'I would ask anyone who recognises the suspects to contact police.

'I would appeal to anyone who may have seen this vehicle leaving the area to contact police.'
