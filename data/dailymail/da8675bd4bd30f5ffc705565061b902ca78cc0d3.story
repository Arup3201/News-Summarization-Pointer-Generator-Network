The origins of the iconic royal yacht Britannia have been laid bare after the release of the original sketches for the design of the ship's interior.

60 years after her launch, drawings of Britannia's state rooms by architect Sir Hugh Casson have been handed over to a trust by his daughter.

The renowned designer was appointed by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who welcomed the opportunity to put their own stamp on the yacht to mark the beginning of a new era.

Designs: These sketches by Sir Hugh Casson depict the original plans for the royal yacht Britannia; this is the Queen's personal study on board the vessel

Collection: The architect's daughter has given the drawings, such as this one which also shows the Queen's study, to the Royal Yacht Britannia Trust

Unchanged: As this photograph of the Queen's study shows, the designs remain largely intact

Britannia was launched in 1953, two months before Her Majesty's coronation, and clocked up more than one million miles until she was decommissioned in 1997.

Sir Hugh was commissioned to put forward ideas after the royal couple rejected the designs put forward by the yacht’s builders.

They wanted the ship to be a 'home from home' whose contemporary style would be a contrast to their ornate palaces.

Among the rooms kitted out by Sir Hugh were the Queen's study, the sun room and the grand staircase - and the designs have remained unchanced for six decades since.

He had been selected for the job after impressing the Duke of Edinburgh in his role as the director of architecture at the Festival of Britain in 1948.

Relaxed: Rooms like the main drawing room were meant to be much more laid-back than the royal palaces

Classic design: Sir Hugh's vision for the main drawing room and other areas of the ship were forward-thinking

Intimate: This drawing shows the design for Prince Philip's bedroom on board the royal yacht

Domestic: The Duke of Edinburgh's bedroom on Britannia, which was decommissioned in 1997

His daughter, Carola Zogolovitch, has now presented the 10 photographic slides of the sketches to the Royal Yacht Britannia Trust for the first time.

Mrs Zogolovitch said: 'When Britannia was commissioned the yacht’s builders had presented to the Queen their ideas for the interior of the yacht in the style of an Atlantic liner.

'The Duke, a Navy man, didn’t want that. He said he wanted something simple.

'My father had been director of architecture and really the impresario at the Festival of Britain. Because the Duke of Edinburgh was so interested in anything that was progressive and new he thought father would be the perfect person to consult.

Sun room and bar: The royal couple were said to love spending time on board Britannia

Leisure space: The sun room and bar area as they appear now on the yacht, which is moored in the Firth of Forth

Office: Prince Philip's study, which he commissioned personally from Sir Hugh Casson

Room: The Duke of Edinburgh's study today, 16 years after Britannia left active service

'Britannia was the first opportunity for the newly crowned Queen and her husband to make something of their own, to their own taste.

'Britannia wasn’t inherited - it was something they could put their own stamp on. It was a floating palace so it needed to be quite formal, but it was also very relaxed.

'The Queen and the Duke were were young at the time and they didn’t want Victorian interiors like at Buckingham Palace. They wanted something that wasn’t too elaborate.

'My father understood what they wanted, and the fact that the rooms have not been changed in 60 years is testament to his designs.

'They were contemporary designs that have stood the test of time. The yacht is like a time capsule.'

Iconic: The grand staircase, which was designed by Sir Hugh in a contemporary 1950s style

Out of use: Britannia now stands decommissioned in Leith, on the Firth of Forth

Bob Downie, chief executive of the Royal Yacht Britannia, said: 'The sketches are a fantastic and fascinating piece of Britannia’s history.

'We are very grateful to have received them and to be able to show them off to our visitors.'

Sir Hugh went on to form a close friendship with the Royal Family, designing interiors at Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace.

He also enjoyed several trips on Britannia as a guest of the Queen Mother.

Britannia was launched at John Brown’s Shipyard in Clydebank on April 16, 1953, two months before the Queen’s coronation and the conquering of Mount Everest.

On royal tours the 410ft yacht boasted a crew of 220 yachtsmen, 21 officers, three season officers and a 26-strong Royal Marine band.

She was decommissioned in Portsmouth on December 11, 1997, after 44 years in service, an occasion which is said to have brought tears to the Queen's eyes.

Britannia is now moored on the Firth of Forth, and can be visited from the town of Leith.
