Scott Redding’s rise up the MotoGP ranks has been as rapid as it has been impressive, and the Brit is determined not to let the upward trajectory stall next term.

The 21-year-old has enjoyed a stellar first season in the premier class of motorcycle racing, and heads into the last race of the season at Valencia as one of the top open-class riders having diced on the track and in the championship with many superior factory bikes over the course of the season.

It’s Redding’s rookie year at the top but his impressive form has been rewarded with his own factory ride next season when the Gloucester born star returns to Marc VDS Racing, the team where he narrowly missed out on claiming the Moto2 title 2013.

Redding hopes he can improve on a best finish of seventh this year by fighting for a maiden MotoGP podium in 2015, but admits while he may have a factory Honda to ride next term, he won’t have the same machinery used by the Japanese giant's primary duo of double world champion Marc Marquez and Dani Pedrosa.

Redding said: ‘My target next year will be some top five results, if I could squeeze up on to the podium a couple of times through the season that would be perfect.

‘The bike is pretty much the same, but not the same. It's almost there but not, there are just aspects a full factory team get but the satellite team won't.’

Redding has spent this season at the Gresini team, having spent the previous four years at VDS in Moto2.

Despite decent on-track results, the Brit has admitted his frustrations of the work ethic within the Italian outfit.

As a result, Redding claims he is looking forward to a VDS return and their stricter approach as the Belgian outfit make their debut in the premier class.

'I don't like the way they work, the Gresini team, but not in a bad way, Redding added. 'But everyone has their preferences.

'I like to be 10.30 is 10.30. When you go, you go.

'But in the Italian team, 10.30 can be 10.40 or whenever you want. I'm used to working in the stricter VDS team.

'I am going to be having a different crew but I'm looking forward to going back with the same team, I've spent a lot of time with them this year off the track.'
