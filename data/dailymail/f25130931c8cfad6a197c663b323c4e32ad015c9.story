With Britain's temperatures rivalling those of the sun-kissed Mediterranean, it's understandable that many will be taking to their gardens to lap up the rays.

But while many revel in the spell of hot weather, travel agents are tearing their hair out - as consumers ditch their holiday plans and instead enjoy the hot weather at home.

The predicted lengthy heatwave means that many have opted to save cash by transferring their holiday plans from exotic trips abroad to their local parks and pools.

Online travel agents have seen bookings for summer holidays drop more than 20 
per cent in the last week, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Steve Endacott, boss of On Holiday Group, said that after a slew of national celebrations in recent years, he had hoped that a slump in bookings would be revived this year.

'To be honest few of us saw this coming, having expected a decent late bookings market without the distractions of European football tournaments, the London Olympics or royal weddings,' he said.

'Unfortunately my personal conclusion is that it will probably last as long as the heat wave does, and rather than delaying the booking decision, it may be simply removing customers from the market.'

But while it's bad news for those trying to sell flights and hotels, retailers have come out on top as consumers dash to stock up on holiday essentials.

Sales of charcoal for barbeques, sunscreen and paddling pools has rocketed, with many choosing to save on the packing and enjoy a staycation.

The relentless sunshine has seen 
rocketing sales of sunscreen – for pets. Cats and dogs can be just as 
susceptible to sunburn as we are.

Stephen Wright, of pet supplier 
Petremedies, said: ‘We’ve been selling around three times as much 
sunscreen in the last few weeks as we had expected to.

Waitrose has seen sales of suncream 
for humans soar by nearly 500 per cent, while charcoal sales are up 720 
per cent, sausages 37 per cent, beer 60 per cent and cider 100 per cent.

Shops have also seen a huge rush on children’s paddling pools over the weekend, with many selling out.

Currys and PC World say that sales of
fans and air coolers have gone up 340 per cent in a week, while ice 
cream makers are up 60 per cent.

But while Brits are currently enjoying the endless sun and baking heat, forecasters are warning that temperatures are becoming dangerously warm for some.

Britain's medical workers and carers 
are on alert because of rising fears over the health of the nation in 
sweltering conditons as the Met Office today said a 'level three 
heatwave' looms.

The nation
has already been issued with a level two warning, where staff are told 
to be vigilant as the heatwave could start to affect vulnerable people's
health, but the weather authority confirmed that a level three warning 
was 'extremely likely' tomorrow.

The
warning system is overseen by Public Health England, a Department of 
Health agency, in a bid to reduce the health impact of the current run 
of stifling temperatures continue across the UK.
