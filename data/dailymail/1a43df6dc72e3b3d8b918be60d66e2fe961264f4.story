More than 100 people were injured and countless more trapped for hours on one of Canadaâ€™s highways as a blizzard swept across the Canadian plains on Thursday afternoon causing multiple-vehicle collisions.

By 4pm 22 patients had been transported from the chaotic scene south of Edmonton to area hospitals with one in serious condition, seven moderate, and 14 minor, Alberta Health Services reports. About 80 others were treated at the scene.

The agency had earlier estimated that 300 people were hurt, four seriously.

Trapped: A pickup truck became sandwiched between a tractor trailer and a minivan following a multi-vehicle crash on Highway 2 south of Edmonton, Alberta on Thursday

Injuries: More than 100 were injured at the site just before noon, with that figure dramatically scaled down from a previous estimate of 300 people

Authorities say that just before noon on Highway 2 the massive pileup began, trapping a passenger bus, semi-trailer trucks and multiple cars together while consequently closing the roads for several hours.

'I looked up and eighteen-wheelers were crashing into each other, cars flying into each other. About every 200 meters it was a pileup,' bus passenger Derek Fildebrandt told the Edmonton Journal.

A surrounding snowdrift was estimated measuring 100 meters long and more than a half a meter deep proving difficult for crews repeatedly attempting to clear the road.

A 'multi-casualty' incident bus rushed to the scene as fire officials went from vehicle to vehicle checking on passengers, said Kerry Williamson of the Alberta Health Services office.

Many victims were taken to hospitals in nearby communities including Edmonton and Red Deer, she said.

Conditions: By 4pm 22 patients had been transported from the chaotic scene south of Edmonton to area hospitals with one in serious condition, seven moderate, and 14 minor

White out: White out conditions were reported along with surrounding snowdrift estimated measuring 100 meters long and more than a half a meter deep

Closed: The Royal Canadian Mounted Police closed part of Highway 2, the main road between Edmonton and Calgary, and were directing traffic away from the collision scene

Overwhelming reports: Between 6am and 5pm on Thursday Edmonton police recorded 133 crashes while on an average day they say they usually seen between 50 and 70

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police closed part of Highway 2, the main road between Edmonton and Calgary, and were directing traffic away from the collision scene, said RCMP Staff Sgt. Grant MacDonald.

Between 6am and 5pm on Thursday Edmonton police recorded 133 crashes - nine of which caused injuries, nine where hit and runs and 115 involved minor damages.

The city's police force says they usually see between 50 and 70 a day.
