These pictures capture the moment a group of playful dolphins bravely race a huge 73,000 ton container ship, using the boat's wake to propel themselves high up into the air just feet ahead of the tanker.

On what was an otherwise calm day with few waves, the dolphins took advantage of those created by the massive 984ft long German freighter as it cut through the water some 20 miles south west of Islamorada in Florida's shipping lanes.

Commercial marine photographer Richard Steinberger, from Denver, Colorado, spotted the dolphins from a nearby boat 300m away as he filmed an advertising campaign for Boston Whaler boats.Â 

The 42-year-old said:'We
 approached within a safe distance of the ship and followed her for a 
short distance so I was able to capture a handful images. The
 dolphins only jumped for a couple minutes but we were incredibly 
fortunate to have witnessed and captured their playfulness.'

He added: 'The
 whole encounter provided much joy and excitement - and of course the 
fear of not getting a clean shot as the boat was rocking quite a bit.'

Catch of the day: Mr Steinberger said: 'While I was waiting for guys to catch fish, a huge freighter began heading towards us. As it approached we all of a sudden noticed dolphins jumping the bow wake.'

Lucky break: Mr Steinberger said that he was 'incredibly fortunate' to have witnessed the dolphins racing as they only raced for a few minutes

When he returned to his hotel room after their boat made its way to the shore, Mr Steinberger zoomed in on the ship and spotted a tiny seabird perched on the anchor quietly watching the dolphins play below
