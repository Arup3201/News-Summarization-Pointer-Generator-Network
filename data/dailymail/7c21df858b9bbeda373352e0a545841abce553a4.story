The parents of a 23-month-old baby boy who died from a heroin overdose have both pleaded not guilty to his manslaughter.

Simon Jones and Emma Bradburn have appeared at Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court today charged with killing of their son, 23-month-old Daniel Jones.

The 29-year-old man and 33-year-old woman from Wolverhampton, are charged with manslaughter by causing or allowing the death of a child.

Ms Bradburn and Mr Jones spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and date of births and entered pleas through their solicitors.

There was no application for bail and they were were both remanded in custody.

Paramedics were called to a house in Windsor Avenue, Penn, Wolverhampton over the death on May 29.

Forensic tests have since revealed he died as a result of a heroin overdose.

Police arrived at the semi-detached house on the quiet residential street yesterday and led the couple away in handcuffs.

There was no sign of police activity at the house today.

Social services, police and the Probation Service were today meeting to discuss the death. It is not known if the child was known to social workers.

Wolverhampton City Council said the 
serious case review sub-committee of its Safeguarding Children's Board 
will meet this afternoon to consider the case.

Neighbours today spoke of their shock and said Daniel's death had been 'devastating'.

Anthony Baker, aged 67, and daughter Natalie, 38, who live next door to the couple, said they saw police arrive at the address at about 8am yesterday.

Mr Baker said the couple had lived in Windsor Avenue for about two years and he remembered the day Daniel died.

He said: 'It was devastating.'He was an ordinary child. I used to have a laugh with him over the fence.

'He was a happy normal child,' a neighbour said, and (right) Simon Jones, who denies manslaughter

Miss Baker added: 'He was a normal happy child.'

Residents said they were surprised to hear of the arrests in such a quiet area.

Penn ward councillor Martin Waite, who lives nearby, said: 'I'm massively surprised to hear that something like this has happened here.

'We have meetings with police every month and Penn is generally a low crime area.'

Ms Bradburn and Mr Jones are both due to appear at Wolverhampton Crown Court on March 7.
