The inmate allegedly assaulted by former NFL star Aaron Hernandez has been released on bail, police have said.

Andrew Booker, 25, was reportedly attacked by the ex-New England Patriot at Bristol County House of Correction in North Dartmouth.

He was wearing handcuffs at the time of the fight - and was allegedly left with a number of cuts, bruises and scrapes.

Now, the prisoner, who was in jail on drug and weapons-related charges, has been released on bail, a spokesman for the Bristol County Sheriff told WCVB.

It comes as Booker's lawyer has said his client does not want to testify about the incident, which happened at the facility in late February.

'He doesn't want to go after Hernandez. He doesn't want to be a rat,' attorney Michael Maloney told the Atteleboro Sun-Chronicle.

This is despite Bristol County Sheriff, Thomas Hodgson, previously claiming his office is seeking a criminal complaint for assault against Hernandez., who has been in prison since June 26 last year.

Booker, who has pleaded not guilty following his arrest last September, allegedly 'exchanged words' with Hernandez several weeks before the attack, before the pair went their separate ways.

However, the two men later bumped into each other in a hallway in the prison - prompting Hernandez to reportedly launch the assault.

'They were having a verbal feud. It escalated, got out of control and Booker was assaulted while handcuffed,' said Mr Maloney.

The alleged victim was left with a number of cuts, bruises and scrapes, according to TMZ, but no charges have yet been issued.

Hernandez, who was not wearing handcuffs at the time, was moved to a special isolation unit following the alleged attack, where he must stay for up to 30 days.Â 

The former Patriots tight end is currently awaiting trial for the shooting death of Odin Lloyd.

He is also being sued by the families of two men who were killed in a 2012 drive-by shooting outside a Boston nightclub.
