Some of the biggest names in showbusiness, including actors  Hugh Grant and Kevin Spacey,  have joined a campaign to keep a Russian media magnate out of jail.

The stars, who also include supermodel Natalia Vodianova and actor John Malkovich, have sent letters of support for Alexander Lebedev to the Russian Politburo.

The former KGB spy turned newspaper tycoon is facing a charge of ‘hooliganism motivated by religious, political, racial, ethnic or ideological hatred’ after hitting a businessman on a TV chat show.

Mr Lebedev, 53, whose family own The Independent and London Evening Standard newspapers, faces up to five years in prison for punching Sergei Polonsky in the face in 2011.

Notting Hill star Grant, 52, said in his letter he had known Mr Lebedev for ten years and described him as ‘well-educated, philanthropic and admired by many here in the UK’.

Vodianova, 30, described Mr Lebedev as a ‘long-term friend’ and a ‘noble person’. Spacey, 53, said he had known Mr Lebedev for more than a decade and ‘it would be unfair to jail him for such a minor accident’.

Mr Lebedev’s trial is set to begin in Moscow next month. Mr Polonsky, 40, is in jail in Cambodia accused of threatening a group of sailors at knifepoint – a charge he denies.
