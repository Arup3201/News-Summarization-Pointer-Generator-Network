A movie producer who worked on horror films including Scream and The Hills Have Eyes, has revealed the emotional trauma of being stalked by her boyfriend.

Marianna Maddalena is suing the man she thought she was having a loving relationship with, after he admitted to installing spy software on her computer and impersonating her in emails to friends and family.

Miss Maddalena thought she was losing her mind and started to see a therapist, as friends and co-workers began to cut ties from her, a California court heard.

Stalked: Scream producer Marianne Maddalena is suing her ex-boyfriend after he was arrested for using spy software to track her emails and impersonate her

It was only when she received a reply to an email she knew she had not sent that Miss Maddalena began to suspect her boyfriend was tracking her.

She is now suing Derrick John Toole for defamation, stalking and impersonating her.

The 48-year-old Woodland Hills contractor pleaded guilty to illegal wiretapping and computer access and fraud in November last year and was sentenced to five years' probation.

The couple, who did not live together, had been dating 'on and off' since 2007 and Miss Maddalena believed she was 'in a loving, safe and enjoyable relationship'.

The movie producer claimed Toole 'used 
surreptitious software and other manipulative technology to start to 
spin a web of deceit, defamation, interference, trespass, and mind games' according to the complaint.

Toole allegedly installed Spectorsoft Eblaster spyware on the producer's laptop and set it to send reports of her emails and passwords, as well as details of she spoke to on instant messenger. 

It is claimed that he also installed a tracking device on the car of Miss Maddalena, a long-time work partner of horror film director Wes Craven, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

Miss Maddalena said having her identity 'hijack[ed]' by Toole destroyed many of her working and personal 
relationships, made her anxious, paranoid and untrusting, and caused her to lose thousands of dollars in income by damaging 
her professional reputation.

When the FBI searched Toole's home, they found about 7,000 printed reports on Miss Maddalena, including emails, attachments and bank statements, stored in a plastic container.

He allegedly used the information to 'falsely depict himself as 
her in writing emails, other electronic messages, and texts to family 
members, friends and co-workers'.

The complaint added that Toole impersonated her to family and friends to portray her 'as not caring, and wanting 
them out of her life or business. He also sent family members Ms. 
Maddalena's private and personal emails sent to others in confidence to 
embarrass and mortify her and others'.

As her friends started to keep their distance Miss Maddalena said she believed she was going crazy.

In January 2011 however, she received a reply to an email she knew she had not sent, and hired computer experts to check her computers.

When she confronted him, he allegedly threatened to reveal sensitive information about her and began to threaten her family and harass her, it is alleged.

The producer is seeking an injunction and several thousand dollars in compensatory damages,  punitive damages for violations of federal cybercrime laws, intentional infliction of emotional distress, trespass, defamation, assault, battery, stalking, false light, public disclosure of private facts, and other offenses.

Miss Maddalena, who is currently working on romantic movie Jerusalem I Love You, is also seeking reimbursement for her counseling and medical expenses.

At his sentencing for cyber fraud in November, Toole said: 'I think I kind of got caught up in bad behavior, and I didn't realize how much I hurt somebody,' according to Daily News Los Angeles.

Toole could not be reached for comment.
