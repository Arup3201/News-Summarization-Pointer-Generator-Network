Some of England's most unusual office blocks, including several with a futuristic spaceship-style design, have been given listed status.

The 14 buildings all date from after the Second World War, and were listed at Grade II as part of a drive by English Heritage to recognise a new generation of architecture - much of which was controversial when it was built.

The organisation praised the way that architects have responded to 'radical changes' in the way offices work, with a shift towards open-plan space dominated by rows of computers.

Listed: Mountbatten House, known as the 'Hanging Gardens of Basingstoke', is now officially a Grade II listed building

Protection: IBM's British headquarters in Cosham, Hampshire is another building to have been given official legal protection

Multi-storey: 30 Cannon Street in London, left, and Birmingham's Alpha Tower, right, are two of the taller buildings to be listed

Protection: MEA House in Newcastle was listed as part of the new drive to defend modern office buildings from demolition

Among the buildings listed are 30 Cannon Street in the City of London, a sleek black with rounded curves just around the corner from St Paul's Cathedral.

Also given listed status is Civil Aviation Authority House - formerly Space House - in London, designed by the architect behind the Centre Point tower.

The 'Hanging Gardens of Basingstoke' - Mountbatten House and its roof gardens - have both been listed, with the gardens given grade II status on the register of parks and gardens.

IBM's British headquarters in Cosham, Hampshire, designed by the firm of Norman Foster, is also now protected from destruction thanks to its listing.

Innovative: Gun Wharf in Chatham, Kent was built for Lloyd's of London but is now the headquarters of Medway Council

Brutalist: The Gun Wharf office block was built using exposed brick in a style popular in the 1970s

Unusual: 1 Finsbury Avenue in central London, built by Arup Associates, is on the list of buildings protected from significant alteration

Pavilions: The former Central Electricity Generating Board in Bristol has been honoured for its architectural importance

Sleek: St James's House in Birmingham, whose exterior is on the left and interior is pictured right, has also been listed

Four of the 14 office blocks are in London, two in Birmingham, two in Newcastle and the other six distributed around other major cities and suburban areas.

A number of other buildings were also considered for listing but ultimately rejected, including Tower 42, formerly known as the Natwest Tower, which is one of the most prominent skyscrapers in the City of London.

Listed buildings cannot be altered or demolished without explicit permission from the local planning authority, which often consults central government before allowing any changes.

The rules state that buildings are only eligible for listing 30 years after they were built - meaning that all of the newly listed office blocks date from before 1985.

Under-rated? The Twentieth Century Society argues that buildings like the former office of Ryder and Yates in Newcastle need more protection

Futuristic: Space House in Holborn, central London, left, and the former Midland Bank in Liverpool, right, share aspects of their design

Controversial: Buildings like Bank House in Leeds, pictured, are not to everyone's taste despite their new status

Geometric: Bank House is constructed from interlocking rectangles which overhang the street below

Garden: Another view of Mountbatten House in Basingstoke, whose garden has been listed as well as the building itself

The Twentieth Century Society argues that more protection is needed for modern buildings, because they are often given a lower priority than more historic structures despite their architectural importance.

Culture minister Ed Vaizey, who approved English Heritage's recommendation over the listings, said: 'Listed buildings are not just about historic houses and ancient monuments, they also serve to protect our recent heritage and preserve the best examples of our fantastic architecture.

'This group of listings reflect the changing face of our working environment and represent the very best in design and it's entirely right that they be listed grade II.'

Roger Bowdler of English Heritage added: 'These offices show how architecture has adapted to recent radical changes in how we work.

'They show how the open-plan working space for computer-led work came about, and how architects responded to the need for lettable, attractive spaces with ingenuity and a deep understanding of human needs.'
