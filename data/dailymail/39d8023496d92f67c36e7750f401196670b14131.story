The funeral procession for a slain Philadelphia cop was nearly stopped before it began were it not for the strength and ingenuity of some mourning officers.

Faced with a car blocking the route following Sunday's funeral, no owner in sight and no tow truck near enough to move it in time, over a dozen of Robert Wilson III's fellow policemen pitched in to move it themselves.

'We just moved the car,' explained Springfield Township Corporal Shawn Hart.

It was a last ditch effort as countless mourners looked nervously at the car blocking their path.

Hero: Wilson helped protect a video game store full of people when he was gunned down by robbers

'I just asked some guys in line for a hand. They came over and we moved it to the side,' Hart told NBC Philadelphia. 

'The procession was able to get past and that was it. After the procession came by [the car's owner] jumped in his car and moved it out of the way before the hearse came down.'

No one is sure exactly how many officers pitched in or from which departments they came.

'There were so many,' Hart told NBC Philly. 'They just came over, grabbed a piece of the car and they moved it. I don't even know where they were from.' 

In his final, courageous moments, Officer Robert Wilson III took on two armed robbers and gave his life to save those around him — an act so noble that Philadelphia's police department will rename its valor medal in his honor, police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said.

Ramsey recounted Wilson's heroism during the slain officer's funeral on Saturday, telling thousands of mourners it was the greatest act of bravery he has seen in his 46-year law enforcement career.

'Robert redefined what valor means, in my mind,' Ramsey said. 

Surveillance video of the March 5 encounter at a GameStop store in north Philadelphia captured the 30-year-old Wilson's unflinching response, Ramsey said.

The gunmen burst in as the 8-year department veteran waited in line to purchase a game for his son, who had excelled in school and was turning 10 in a few days. He instinctively moved from the counter to draw the suspects' gunfire away from innocent bystanders and returned fire, Ramsey said. More than 50 shots were fired during the fierce gunbattle, investigators said.

'He never stopped until that fatal round was fired,' Ramsey told the assembled crowd, many of whom were law enforcement officers from across the country whose dress uniforms formed patterns of blues and tans inside the Palestra sports arena. 

Wilson was remembered as energetic and hardworking. His family (above) attended a memorial viewing for him on Friday

Philadelphia officer Robert Wilson III, 30, was remembered at a funeral on Saturday after he was slain at a GameStop in the cities north while buying a video game for his son Quahmier, 10, earlier this month

Mayor Michael Nutter said he is struggling to comprehend the loss of the city's 10th police officer killed in the line of duty in the last 9 years.

The city has lost a friend, a brother and an American hero, Nutter said.

'Two cowards came upon him, firing at him,' Nutter said. 'He fought them valiantly until he could fight no more.'

Ramone Williams, 24, and Carlton Hipps, 29, are charged with murder, attempted murder, robbery and other offenses.

'I miss my man,' Wilson's partner, Damien Stevenson, told mourners. He shot one of the suspects in the leg as they attempted to flee. 

Stevenson reminisced about the fun he and Wilson had on patrol in their car, No. 2222, the time they donned red and white striped socks to entertain children at a Ronald McDonald House and the banter they shared.

'That's all we did, we had fun,' Stevenson said, as a video screen displayed images of the partners in their squad car, the slain officer smiling broadly. 'There was no car like 22-22.'

Wilson will receive the newly renamed medal of valor and the department's medal of honor and a posthumous promotion to sergeant, Ramsey said.
