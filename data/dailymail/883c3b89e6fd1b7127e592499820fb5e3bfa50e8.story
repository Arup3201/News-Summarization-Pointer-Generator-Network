Nathan Hines has little interest in any Aviva Premiership points target as Sale Sharks continue their quest to secure European Champions Cup qualification.

Sale are currently seventh in the Premiership table - one place off sealing a guaranteed Champions Cup place next term - with five games left.

Sharks' final phase of the domestic campaign begins against visitors Gloucester on Sunday, while further appointments await with London Irish, Harlequins, Newcastle and Exeter.

And while Sale realistically cannot afford any slip-ups during the season's closing stages, Sharks' former Scotland lock Hines is not looking beyond tackling Gloucester.

'I don't know what will get us into the top six,' he said. 'All I know is we want to win every game. If we are thinking about how many games we need to win, that will be our undoing.

'We are just thinking about Gloucester, win that one, chalk that one up and then move on to the next. That is the best and most efficient way to look at it, really.

'I know it's a cliche to say one game at a time, but if you start spreading your focus around too many things, you will come unstuck.

'It's about making sure not to worry if we win and someone else loses. It's more about worrying about our own performance as a team and as individuals. It's about getting our own stuff right.'

England international Danny Cipriani is back in Sale's number 10 shirt on Sunday, while on-loan centre Brendan Macken makes his first start for Gloucester, featuring alongside England's Billy Twelvetrees in midfield.
