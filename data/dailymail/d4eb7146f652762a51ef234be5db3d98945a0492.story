Bones have been found on the roof of a funeral home shut down after frozen water bottles were allegedly used to preserve dead bodies inside.

Grievers have been gathering outside Carter Funeral Chapels in Chicago, Illinois, demanding to know what has happened to their relatives’ remains.

Police said they found a back door off its hinges, no power or heating inside the building and bodies in ‘various states of preparation’.

‘My dad died three months and ten days ago,’ Julia Bailey told Fox News. ‘I want my Daddy's ashes. I want some answers. It's indescribable.’

Carter held a funeral for her father Tom McLin, who died aged 82, and his body was cremated. But the family don’t know where his ashes are.

Police searched Carter on Monday morning after they responded to call of a suspicious person in a car in front of the home at 3:45am.

They searched the home and found it in a ‘state of disarray’ with three men inside. Two said they worked there as caretakers, police said.

There was an arrest warrant out against the third for a traffic violation. He was arrested but the other men were not, reported Fox News.

The owner got a violation notice for providing improper care to human remains and failing to have the right facilities or equipment, police said.

But Henry Carter told the Chicago Tribune he always treats bodies in his care ‘with the utmost respect’ and was not criminally charged.

‘They have combed every inch of this funeral home (and) have not found one thing non-compliant,’ the owner Mr Carter said outside the home.

‘Had things not been compliant, I would have left here in handcuffs.'

All but three of the bodies were removed by the end of Monday and taken to other homes, with the remaining ones taken away on Tuesday.

The Cook County Medical Examiner's Office is looking at the discovered bones on Tuesday to find out whether they are from a human.

Chicago building inspectors and Illinois Department of Health officials are also investigating the building, reported Fox News.

Trade officials sued Mr Carter last July for allegedly failing to provide an itemised service list. His licence as a funeral director was suspended in 2008.

However this means he could still own a funeral home and get someone with a licence to carry out the embalming, reported the Chicago Tribune.
