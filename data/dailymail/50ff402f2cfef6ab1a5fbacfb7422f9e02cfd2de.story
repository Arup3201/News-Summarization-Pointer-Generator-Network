Fleur East may have been accused by Mel B of 'cheating' in her Eighties Week performance of Monie Love's It's A Shame on X Factor but at least her outfit won plaudits.

The aspiring singer, who was told by Mel B that she couldn't hear her voice pop against the backing track, looked on-trend in a super luxe outfit of Dolce and Gabbana, Moschino, DKNY and vintage Chanel.

The woman responsible for 26-year-old Fleur's cool new look is Gemma Sheppard, who has worked with the likes of Dannii Minogue, and helps curate each and every look for the live shows.

Confident contestant: X Factor hopeful Fleur East looked on-trend in a super luxe outfit of Dolce and Gabbana, Moschino, DKNY and vintage Chanel, which the show's stylist said 'screamed cool'

'That girl has an incredible body and she knows how to show it off in a sexy, strong way,' Gemma told MailOnline.

'Her song choice on Saturday night called for a very cool look. I love a varsity jacket over a bra - it's a whole stage vibe and a leopard print mixed with a print screams cool.'

Gemma believes that fashion is an 'emotional tool' and if you look good, you feel good.

'It's all about confidence and getting inside of the contestant's heads,' she said. 'It is their closest moment to becoming a pop star so I want that to be translated in what they're wearing.' 

Showcasing her assets: Gemma Sheppard, who styled the contestants, said that Fleur has an incredible body and she knows how to show it off in a sexy, strong way'

Behind the scenes: Gemma Instagrammed this snap of Fleur with the caption: 'There is no SHAME in looking so swag baby girl'

She continued: 'For 80s week we simply saluted the decade, I didn't want to play dress up with the contestants and make them look like they're in fancy dress on their way to a rollersdisco. 

'There's actually a lot of 80s inspired fashion on the high street just now so for this week's looks we were able to mix current season with some vintage pieces.'

And it seems that Gemma is working her magic on the contestants; they spoke on the Xtra Factor about how her styling is giving them confidence.

'The contestants need to feel not just comfortable with their styling, but actually empowered by it. Styling isn't about "telling" someone what to wear. It's a process that ultimately leads to what they know they need to wear so they can perform at their best for that moment,' she explained.

Gemma, who has worked in commercial TV for many years, emphasises that when it comes to styling for live shows, you've got to think of the whole stage production.

'It's not just how you look in the dressing room, you have to consider ‎how the whole package, the music, the dancers, the lights, your make up, will look for the viewer. Lots of the acts have reviewed their performances back and can now see how the styling works with and compliments the creative direction,' she said.

New heights: Lola Saunders, who usually favours flat shoes, wore heels on the show and was complimented by the judges. Gemma believes that heels quite literally raise a contestant's game 

Another contestant who felt empowered by her styling was Lola Saunders, who Gemma put in heels despite the young singer's penchant for flats. 

'Heels, killer heels, I love them. They finesse an outfit and literally help you raise your game,' said Gemma.

'Admittedly some of the girls have said they're more comfortable in trainers, but they've seen their looks back on camera and they understand what a difference completing an outfit with heels can make. 

'I also practice what I preach, however long the day, whether I'm at studio, doing pulls from stores or on a shoot I am always, always in heels.'

On Sunday, Cheryl's acts Chloe Jasmine and Stephanie Nala were the latest victims of the show.

The X Factor Stylist, Jamie Stevens, says: “This is a fantastic twist on the classic ponytail, combining it with a beehive for a high-impact finish.”

STEP 1:

Apply TRESemmé Instant Refresh Dry Shampoo (RRP £4.99 for 200ml) to the roots of dry hair and work through for loads of texture and hold. Section the hair just above the ears and secure the lower section into a ponytail at the nape of the neck with an elastic.

STEP 2:

Dust TRESemmé 24 Hour Body Plumping Powder (RRP £5.50 for 10g) onto the roots of the lower and upper sections and massage in well to create loads of volume without needing to backcomb. Add the hair from the beehive section to the lower ponytail and secure with another elastic.

STEP 3:

Starting at the side of the head, take one inch sections of hair from the top section and secure just above the ponytail using kirby grips. Take a half an inch section of hair from the ponytail and wrap it around the top of the ponytail and pin to secure the look and hide the elastics. For a soft finish, leave some hair loose around the face.
