Three British cabin crew managers are set to become the aviation world’s first flying butlers when Etihad Airways' The Residence takes to the skies in December.

Richard Burrows from Manchester, Eren Wirizlay from Telford and Georgina Henderson from Southport are part of a handpicked team of 13 to complete a specially tailored training course in London led by the Savoy Hotel’s Head Butler.

The flying butlers will look after VIP guests booked in Etihad Airways’ new three-room cabin, which costs a staggering £12,500 per flight.

A series of master classes  focused on etiquette and protocol, valet skills and concierge services, to boost the cabin crew’s existing high level customer service experience.

The five-star hotel's head butler Sean Davoren says: 'They all now possess the skills required to provide the highest standard of hospitality for the airline's premium customers, by blending the discretion of a traditional English butler with the efficiency of a 21st century personal assistant.'

The newly qualified flying butlers, who all currently work as in-flight chefs or food and beverage managers on board Etihad Airways’ long-haul fleet of aircraft, were given the special training at the London School of Hospitality and Tourism at the University of West London, as well as on-the-job training at the Savoy Hotel.

Newly-trained butler Georgina Henderson, 28, said she was 'thrilled' to have the chance of working on the enormous Airbus A380 aircraft.

'The thought of being the world's first flying butler is amazing and obviously all of us who qualified would love to have that honour.

'But if it's not to be on the inaugural flight I won't be disappointed as my time will come soon enough and I really believe that I'm going to be playing a part in aviation history.'

The Residence, which features a living room, private shower and double bedroom, is on board the airlines first Airbus A380 aircraft. The A380 will be deployed on Etihad Airways’ Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow route.

The newly qualified flying butlers, who all currently work as in-flight chefs or food and beverage managers on board Etihad Airways’ long-haul fleet of aircraft, were given the special training at the London School of Hospitality and Tourism at the University of West London, as well as on-the-job training at the Savoy Hotel.

The Savoy was chosen by Etihad Airways’ management as the location for the tailored training course, as the hotel was the first in the world to establish its own academy to teach professional butlers.

World first: The butlers are all eager to be the first flying butler on the inaugural flight

Aubrey Tiedt, Etihad Airways’ Vice President Guest Services said: 'I am extremely proud of the team’s achievements and they all qualified with flying colours to become the world’s first ever butlers in the sky. 

'They are really enthusiastic and cannot wait to board the A380 aircraft and put into practice all that they have learned.

'Etihad Airways aims to be the best in everything we set out to do and the flying butlers will provide a level of service that no traveller has ever experienced in commercial aviation.'

Expertise: The Savoy trained crew to have 'the discretion of a traditional English butler with the efficiency of a 21st century personal assistant'

Sean Davoren, the Savoy’s Head Butler, added: 'The Etihad Airways trainees have been an absolute joy to work with and they all now possess the skills required to provide the highest standard of hospitality for the airline’s premium customers, by blending the discretion of a traditional English butler with the efficiency of a 21st century personal assistant.'

The first Etihad Airways A380 service will fly from the UAE capital to London’s Heathrow Airport on Saturday 27 December. 

The airline will receive three more of the superjumbo aircraft in 2015 and the new planes will fly from Abu Dhabi to London and Abu Dhabi to Sydney. New York will follow as the next destination for the airline’s A380.
