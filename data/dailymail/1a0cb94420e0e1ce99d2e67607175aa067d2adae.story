A 16-year-old boy died trying to save his 13-year-old brother after he fell from slippery rocks into a creek on Tuesday.

The 13-year old boy whose identity has not been released fell into the water at Lasells Stewart Picnic Area in Wildwood Falls on the Row River in Oregon.

The 16-year-old boy whose identity is also not being released lowered himself to the rocks to try to hold onto his brother who was nearly washed away by the rapid moving water.

Due to the speedy current of the water, the 16-year-old was unable to grasp his younger brother and so he lowered himself into the creek in attempt to help him survive.

Unfortunately both brothers fell down a narrow chute of water and only the 13-year-old emerged alive.

The older brother never returned to the surface of the water, reported KVAL.

Lane County Search and Rescue Divers searched the area and later recovered the older brother's body after they removed a large log from the water chute.

The Mail Online attempted to contact the police department to learn the boys' identities but no one was available for comment.

The condition of the 13-year-old's health is unknown though he is still alive.
