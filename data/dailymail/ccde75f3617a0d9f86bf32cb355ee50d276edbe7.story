Boris Johnson yesterday called on George Osborne to ‘junk talk of austerity’ and pump more money into big spending projects amid fears the economy could be heading towards a triple dip recession.

The plea from one of the Tory Party’s most prominent figures came after bleak figures from the Office for National Statistics showed output fell 0.3 per cent between October and December.

This weaker than expected performance left City experts predicting an unprecedented triple dip recession, while others said the downturn is now worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Call: Boris Johnson, right,  yesterday called on George Osborne, left, to ‘junk talk of austerity’ and pump more money into big spending projects amid fears the economy could be heading towards a triple dip recession

In a very public challenge to 
mainstream Conservative policy, London mayor Mr Johnson warned that the 
‘hair-shirt’ agenda set by the Chancellor and gloomy remarks from the 
Bank of England threaten hopes of a recovery.

And in a sign of coalition tensions 
over the flatlining economy, Nick Clegg made clear the Liberal Democrats
 will demand higher capital spending on infrastructure projects in the 
next public spending review – a shot across Mr Osborne’s bows.

The Office for National Statistics said the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the last three months of 2012, which meant there was no growth overall last year

Construction grew by 0.3 per cent, but not enough to make up for sharp drops in the last year

IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said the Budget in March would be a good time to slow the pace of austerity

The slump rounded off the worst four-year period for the British economy, excluding the aftermath of war, since the 1830s.

It is feared it could be followed by 
another quarter of decline at the start of this year, which would mean 
Britain was in recession again.

The ONS report said that the British 
economy did not grow at all in 2012 and has now shrunk for four of the 
last five quarters, with the only growth coming between July and 
September when output rose 0.9 per cent with the help of the Olympics.

The economy is still 3.3 per cent 
below its pre-crisis peak in 2008 and fears are mounting that Britain 
will be stripped of its coveted AAA credit rating as tax receipts 
dwindle and debts soar.

Addressing British business leaders 
at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Johnson called for a change of 
tack from the Government.

‘We need to junk talk of austerity 
and recognise that the single biggest inhibitor of demand is lack of 
confidence, and that if only some of the people in this room would 
invest some of the cash in their balance sheets we would see that 
confidence rewarded in a virtuous circle,’ he said.

He attacked the downbeat rhetoric 
emerging from both the Treasury and the Bank of England and alluded to 
the painful age of austerity overseen by post war Labour Chancellor Sir 
Richard Stafford Cripps.

The sharp drop in output was caused mostly by contraction in production, wiping out a small rise in construction

‘I don’t think austerity is a 
terribly useful concept in this sort of climate,’ he said. ‘The hair 
shirt stuff, the Stafford Cripps agenda, that is not the way to get 
Britain motoring again.’

Mr Johnson said he backed the 
Chancellor’s plans to cut the deficit but said more cuts would need to 
be found to invest in housing and infrastructure.

Mr Clegg warned that ‘there is some 
way to go before the recovery really takes root’ and conceded that it 
would be ‘a long, painstaking job before the British economy fully 
recovers’.

A day earlier he admitted in an 
interview that the Government should not have cut capital spending so 
much when it first came to power.

Aides said he is not challenging the 
Chancellor’s overall levels of government spending. But they said he 
will argue for even more capital expenditure on infrastructure projects 
in the next spending round. ‘This is a priority for us,’ one said.

But speaking in Davos yesterday, Mr 
Osborne insisted he would not change course. ‘We have a reminder today 
that Britain faces a very difficult economic situation,’ he said.

‘A reminder that last year was 
particularly difficult, that we face problems at home because of the 
debts built up over many years and problems abroad with the eurozone, 
where we export most of our products, in recession.’
