Bosses at the iconic British holiday company Butlins have flown to Poland as part of a recruitment drive, as jobhunters back home were given the cold shoulder.

Two bosses from Butlins flew out to Eastern Europe on Thursday to carry out interviews to fill 20 'Dream Team' roles in mixed accommodation and catering.

Catering boss Paul Todd and head of accommodation Tommy Todd made the three day trip this week after a recruitment 'open day' at the Job Centre in Minehead, Somerset, where one of the company's holiday camps in based, saw just six applicants gain second interviews, according to reports.

A spokesman for the company told the Sunday Mirror agencies in Poland put workers on waiting lists, so they were ready when needed.

The spokesman said: 'They are looking for people in Poland to fill missing numbers.'

The company has said six of the 12 of those who attended the British open day were asked back for a second interview.

Following the Sunday Mirror report last week that Butlins was hiring minimum-wage staff in Eastern European countries including Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, there was an angry response from those back home.

Former Butlins head of security Mark Bonser, who left the Minehead camp to set up a male grooming parlour, told the paper: 'I walk around this town and see huddles of teenagers doing nothing but smoking pot outside boarded-up shops.

'As a responsible local employer Butlins could be doing something to give these youngsters a chance.'

A Butlins spokesman said the vast majority of its staff are recruited from the UK

A Butlins spokesman told MailOnline:Â  'Our staff recruitment policy is based on 
decades of experience in running a very successful leisure business.

'We begin with Open Days at Job Centres and colleges in the areas near 
our three resorts. We follow on with recruitment days in towns and 
cities throughout the UK. This is ongoing through the entire season.

'Our experience over more than 50 years of running a seasonal business shows that we will require to make up numbers by employing some staff 
from outside the UK. The vast majority of our staff, however, are 
recruited from within the UK.'
