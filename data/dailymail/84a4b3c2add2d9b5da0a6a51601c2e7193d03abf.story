Awkward: Ed Miliband is 'reluctant to put himself out there'

Labour is to launch a campaign to make Ed Miliband more ‘human’ in the new year after friends warned that he is less popular with voters than Gordon Brown.

The Labour leader has been told by his closest friends that he needs to make a concerted effort to ‘make people like him’ by doing ‘sofa’ interviews with lifestyle shows on television and women’s magazines.

But allies are concerned that Mr Miliband is ‘reluctant to put himself out there’ because he feels awkward about revealing details of his private life to the media.

Yesterday the Labour leader said he would not change after polls showed that his  personal standing is the worst of the three main party leaders.

‘I will carry on being what I am,’ he said.

But an ICM survey for the Guardian newspaper made grim reading for Mr Miliband, suggesting he needs to do more to connect with the public.

It found that 48 per cent of voters approve of David Cameron’s performance, compared with 33 per cent for Nick Clegg and only 32 per cent for Mr Miliband.

The Prime Minister enjoys a net approval rating of plus five, while the gap between those who think Mr Miliband is doing a good job and those who don’t is minus 17 points.

His position has been undermined after a performance at the most recent Prime  Minister’s Question Time, which was widely derided as wretched even by members of the Shadow Cabinet. ‘People still don’t know Ed and he needs to get out there and show them who he is,’ a friend told the Mail.

‘The problem is that he is very reluctant to put himself out there. He’s not comfortable talking about himself. It’s just the same as it was under Gordon.’

Mr Brown won widespread public support for an interview he did with Piers Morgan before the general election, in which he discussed the death of his first child Jennifer, coming close to tears at times.

But the source added: ‘By the time Gordon did the Piers Morgan thing, it was too late.

‘We have to make Ed do it.

‘He’s a nice guy but all that people see is someone who is a policy wonk and stabbed his brother in the back.’

Former Tory leader Lord Howard said: ‘Ed Miliband faces a very difficult task – I don’t think he is making a very good fist of it.’
