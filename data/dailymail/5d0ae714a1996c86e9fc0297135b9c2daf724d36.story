This astonishing footage - captured when a skydiver dropped his GoPro camera at 4,000ft - shows what it's like to freefall to the ground.

The one-minute video shows the very moment the helmet camera becomes detached and makes its spiralling descent back  to earth.

After what starts out as a relatively normal jump, the camera begins its stomach-churning plunge as the skydiver pulls his parachute.

Warning: Video contains fast-moving images. 

In its descent the GoPro camera recorded its owner falling to earth in a far more controlled manner

Initially the free-falling camera, while rotating, shows the skydiver moving  further away.

But it isn't long before the camera picks up speed, spins out of control, and captures some dizzying footage.

The camera continues to record after it slammed into the ground. 

Fortunately for the skydiver he was able to locate the device after he landed.

The incredible footage was captured over Seville, Spain, recently.

The initial jump appears to be going well until the skydiver pulls his parachute and loses his camera
