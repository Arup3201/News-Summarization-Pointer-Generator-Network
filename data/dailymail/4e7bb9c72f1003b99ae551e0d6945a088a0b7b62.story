Legal action: Caroline Mathiesen is suing her former lawyer over claims that mistakes cost her a much larger divorce payout

A wealthy mother who claims her multi-million-pound divorce settlement was far smaller than it should have been because her solicitor was negligent is suing for up to £15million.

Caroline Mathiesen, 51, told the High Court that the solicitor failed to stop her ex-husband taking up to £2million a year from the family firm and lavishing it on children from another marriage and a mistress.

Company director Per Mathiesen, an 82-year-old father of seven, should have been restricted to an income of £250,000, with small annual increases, under an agreement drawn up in 2003 with the advice of her solicitor, she said.

But lawyers representing her at the High Court said that, because of the way it was worded, Mr Mathiesen was able to take huge annual sums from the company, leaving her massively out of pocket when they divorced.

Her barrister, Roger Stewart QC, claimed: 'Per Mathiesen was having an extra-marital affair. He had been hiding money from Caroline Mathiesen and was, without her consent, diverting away significant part of the family's joint wealth to his older children and possibly to his mistress.'

The couple, who had three children, married in 1993 when Mrs Mathiesen was 32 and Mr Mathiesen was 62.

They enjoyed a jetset lifestyle, with a £4.5million Grade-II home in Britain and another luxurious home in France. Mr Mathiesen once bought his wife a £230,000 horse as a gift.

But Mrs Mathiesen, of Exton, Hampshire, claimed she did not know how great her husband's earnings really were until 2002, when a friend on the school run told her he was on the Sunday Times Rich List.

'I was so shocked, I was flabbergasted,' she told Mrs Justice Asplin, adding that by then she had formed a 'deep distrust' of her husband, whom she suspected of having an affair.

She said she went to John Seigal, of the law firm Clintons, telling him she wanted an agreement with 'full protection' to stop her husband taking large sums out of the family's thriving shower business, Matki, for his own use.

'I told him that there were severe problems in the marriage and I had very good reason not to trust Per and that I couldn't go on like this,' she told the court.

Mrs Mathiesen said she believed the agreement drawn up by Clintons limited her husband's salary to £250,000, with a 5-per-cent annual increase. Dividends and bonuses from the company would go into a joint account to pay for the family's living expenses.

But the agreement did not prevent Mr Mathiesen from being paid huge sums because it linked his pay rises to the company's burgeoning profits.

She told the court: 'What I was so in the dark about was how he was able to take so much more than I thought he was supposed to be taking.'

Mr Stewart said Mr Seigal knew what Mrs Mathiesen had wanted to achieve in the 2003 agreement and failed to secure it, resulting in 'uncontrolled withdrawals of funds' from Matki by her husband.

Compensation claim: The divorcee is suing in the High Court for £15million and alleges negligence

'Had she been properly advised, she 
would never have assented to the shareholders' agreement in the form in 
which it was executed,' he added.

Mrs Mathiesen received 45 per cent of 
the matrimonial assets in a divorce judgment last year, but says her 
slice should have been worth far more.

Denying all the claims, Clintons' 
barrister, Michael Soole QC, insisted the £250,000-a-year figure had 
never been mentioned and Mrs Mathiesen had not been in a position to 
make demands, but only to negotiate. The agreement limited her husband's
withdrawals from the firm to those which would allow Matki to 'grow and
prosper in the future with sufficient retained funds', he said.

He added that there was no evidence 
that the amounts her husband took compromised that aim and told the 
court Mr Mathiesen's salary had only increased so quickly because it was
linked to soaring profits.

The hearing continues.
