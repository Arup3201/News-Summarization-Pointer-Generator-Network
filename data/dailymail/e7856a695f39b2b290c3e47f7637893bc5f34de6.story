Kimberley Walsh has become accustomed to dressing in an unflattering green outfit while playing an ogre on stage, while Kara Tointon's currently dressing in drab clothes for her turn in the theatre.

So no wonder the pair took the opportunity to dress to the nines at the Whatsonstage.com theatre awards on Sunday night.

The singer and actress led the stylish ladies gracing the red carpet as they entered the glitzy event.

Stunners: Stars of the theatre Kimberley Walsh and Kara Tointon drew attention in their stunning dresses as they turned up to the Whatsonstage.com awards on Sunday night

Girls Aloud singer Kimberley, who currently plays Princess Fiona in Shrek: The Musical, was a lady in red for the night as she donned a scarlet frock.

The strapless dress with a heart shaped bust flattered her figure and showed off her tanned skin.

Matching the outfit with beige heels with bow detailing and a cute clutch, the singer sparkled as she joined in the festivities.

And Kara looked just as ravishing as she styled herself especially for the awards show at the Prince of Wales theatre in London.

The actress can currently be seen in Absent Friends, in which she has to dress in dowdy clothing and unflattering hairstyles every night.

But on Sunday she was immaculate in an intricate silver gown which showed off her tiny frame with the off-shoulder cut.

The dress, which was embellished with flowers and lace, was teamed with strappy heels.

And she tied her new hair-do up into a high bun, showing off her new fringe style, which was brushed forward.

The former EastEnders star had only debuted the choppy new look earlier this week as she enjoyed the Jasper Conran catwalk show during London Fashion Week.

Stage queen Sheridan Smith was also dressed to the max for the awards in her little black number.

The former blonde looked ravishing with her red hair tied back, showing off the pencil skirt with sheer top.

It was a sophisticated look for the star, who posed with comedian Alan Davies, who also looked dapper in his suit and tie.

Sheridan hosted the event alongside Alan and Jenny Eclair, writing on Twitter before the show: 'Backstage at @Whatsonstage awards with @alandavies1 & @jennyeclair about to go on.Make some noise plse audience,let's make it a good one! :D'

Throughout the night prizes were handed out to stars including Amanda Holden, who won Best Actress in a Musical for her role in Shrek: The Musical before Kimberley took over.

Her colleague Nigel Harman also won Best Supporting Actor in a Musical for the same show, while Catherine Tate was handed the Best Supporting actress in a Play title for Seasons Greetings at the National, Lyttelton.

The Best Actor in a Play award went to Gavin & Stacey star James Corden for his successful stint in One Man, Two Guvnors, which will transfer from the West End to Broadway later this year.

He saw off competition from the likes of Kevin Spacey, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jude Law and David Tennant for the prize.

And Best Actress in a Play went to veteran star Vanessa Redgrave for her role in Driving Miss Daisy.

Winner: Composer and performer Tim Minchin took home an award for his work on musical Matilda The Musical
