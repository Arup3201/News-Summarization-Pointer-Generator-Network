Jailed: Adam Brown, from Maesteg, groomed a schoolboy on Facebook and got him to creep away from home in the middle of the night for a meeting

A paedophile groomed a schoolboy on Facebook and got him to creep away from home in the middle of the night for a meeting.

Adam Brown, 21, who changed his name to Logan Brown by deed poll, was caught when the distraught mother of his victim turned detective to trap him.

Brown had begun talking to the boy after posting videos of himself online, telling jokes and inviting people to say whether they found them funny.

Cardiff Crown Court heard the mother worked nights and left her son and other children with their grandmother.

But when she returned on July 3 she found the family's dog behaving oddly - and when she went to check on the family, she discovered the boy's bed was empty.

She phoned him and he claimed he was just out for a walk.

Prosecutor Gareth James said: 'She got back in her car, found him and confiscated his phone and later his computer, insisting he gave her the passwords.

'The conversation she saw online between her son and the defendant made her feel sick.'

Within an hour of them being in touch, after the young teenager had clicked 'like' on a posting and Brown replied asking to be his Facebook friend, the talk had turned to sex.

'He told him he was cute and then made a sexual suggestion,' Mr James said.

'Then he said he might commit suicide if he didn't reply and there was an agreement to meet up in a park.

'The child left his home in the early hours and the defendant met him and gave him a hug.

'The boy thought the whole thing was weird and returned home where his mother immediately contacted Adam Brown and told him to block contact with her son.

'But instead, shortly after, he contacted the boy again, telling him, "I have just spoken to your Mum - you are an amazing guy - all I want is for you to be happy" and following it with "you and I are having to have a good chat later, ok Hun?"'

When police arrested him, Brown, of Maesteg, south Wales, said he had wanted to kiss the boy but wouldn't have done anything else.

Kevin Seal, defending, said he was troubled and vulnerable and would suffer in prison.

But Recorder Wyn Lloyd Jones said he would be failing in his duty if he didn't lock him up.

'You preyed on the mind of a young boy, threatening to kill yourself and saying he would responsible for assisting a suicide,' he told him.

'I am still not sure you understand how serious this is.'

Brown, who was jailed for 14 months, will be on the sex offenders' register and subject to sexual prevention restrictions for 10 years.
