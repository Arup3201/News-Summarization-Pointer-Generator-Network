A small island which emerges from the Muodaoxi River in southwest China every spring has become a new tourist hot spot because of its similarity to a turtle, reported People's Daily Online.

The scene has been dubbed 'spring turtle rising from water' by local residents. Turtle is an auspicious sign in China representing longevity.

The rock's appearance depends on the amount of floodwater heading downstream. The turtle shape only appears when the water level stands between 163 and 168 metres.

Turtle shape become most visible when the Three Gorges Reservior sends water downstream and the water level drops to 163-168 metres

Muodaoxi river is located within the Three Gorges Reservoir Region and the water level is controlled by the Three Gorges Dam.

Spring is regarded as the best time to enjoy the scene as the Three Gorges Reservoir supplies water to the areas downstream, which brings down the water level.

The natural phenomena is now so well known that once it appears each year word quickly spreads, causing a flood of tourists to take photographs from the nearby mountains and hills.

'It's a popular saying round here for the arrival of spring, we just say the turtle is coming,' said local Meng Liu.

Although new to general tourists, the annual spectacle is well-known among locals. Instead of saying spring is coming, they say 'turtle is coming' 

When the river is at its normal depth at 175 metres, the island only shows a small tip above the water.

In comparison, when the water falls to around 145 metres, the rock becomes connected to the mainland.

The island is in the middle of Muodaoxi River which runs through Longshi village in Yunyang County in Chongqing city. 

The natural phenomena is now so well known that once it appears  a flood of tourists swarm over to take photographs
