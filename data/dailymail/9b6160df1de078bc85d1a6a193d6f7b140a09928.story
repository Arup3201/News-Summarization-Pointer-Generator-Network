Miroslav Klose is now the leading World Cup goalscorer in history after netting during Germany's humiliation of Brazil. But the 36-year-old striker had better enjoy the feeling while it lasts, because he might not hold the title for too long.

In fact, Klose might not even be the top-scoring German at World Cups by the end of Russia 2018. Unless the Polish-born hotshot finds the net in Sunday's final, he is unlikely to add to his 16 strikes so far. But Thomas Muller already has that total in his sights.

Germany coach Joachim Low praised Klose after the match but immediately tipped Muller to set a new record. 'It
 really means a lot to all of us,' said Low. 'This is a record 
that could be beaten only by Muller.'

Record breaker: Miroslav Klose is the new top goalscorer in World Cup history

Not far behind: Klose's team-mate Tjomas Muller looks ready to beat his goals record  

Muller scored the first goal in the 7-1 victory against the hapless Brazilians to bring his haul to 10 goals in just 12 World Cup games. And all signs seem to point towards Muller breaking his compatriot's record in future.

1 Miroslav Klose (Germany)

16 goals in 23 games (0.70 per match)

2 Ronaldo (Brazil)

15 goals in 19 games (0.79 per match)

3 Gerd Muller (Germany)

14 goals in 13 games (1.08 per match)

4 Just Fontaine (France)

13 goals in 6 matches (2.17 per match)

5 Pele (Brazil)

12 goals in 14 games (0.86 per match)

6= Sandor Kocsis (Hungary)

11 goals in 5 games (2.20 per match)

6= Jurgen Klinsmann (Germany)

11 goals in 17 games (0.65 per match)

8= Helmut Rahn (Germany)

10 goals in 10 games (1.00 per match)

8= Gabriel Batistuta (Argentina)

10 goals in 12 games (0.83 per match)

8= Gary Lineker (England)

10 goals in 12 games (0.83 per match)

8= Thomas Muller (Germany)

10 goals in 12 games (0.83 per match)

8= Teofilo Cubillas (Peru)

10 goals in 13 games (0.77 per match)

8= Grzegorz Lato (Poland)

10 goals in 20 games (0.50 per match)

The Bayern Munich forward is just 24 years
 old, so could conceivably have three more World Cups left in him should
 he play on to Klose's age of 36. If he continues his impressive current
 scoring rate of five goals in every World Cup, Muller could have 25 in 
finals by the time he hangs up his boots.

Muller also reaps the easy rewards of playing in front of the most powerful midfield in world football. Toni Kroos appears the natural successor to Xavi as the game's most technically gifted playmaker and is the key to Germany's Teutonic tiki-taka, which is strangling the life out of all who dare stand in their path.

Combined with Bastian Schweinsteiger's brains and brawn, plus gifted footballers in Mesut Ozil, Mario Gotze and Sami Khedira among others, Germany look set to dominate international football for the forseeable future.

As Klose has proved there really is no better gig in football than playing up front for Germany in major tournaments. There are five Germans in the top 10 goalscorers in World Cups.

Klose set his goals record by overtaking Ronaldo - the original one - who is among the most skilful and deadly strikers ever to have graced the game. Yet Klose has still managed to surpass his tally thanks to Germany's stunning consistency in major tournaments and a lack of injury problems.

Despite their huge strength in other areas of the pitch, there are also few rivals for Muller's position in Germany's team.

The talented but raw Andre Schurrle has provided a sharper cutting edge than Muller when coming on from the bench and has three goals despite limited game time in Brazil. Otherwise only Klose, who is enjoying a last hurrah in his career, and the limited Lukas Podolski provide scant competition for the striker’s spot.

Start of the rout: Muller took advantage of awful Brazil defending to score Germany's opening goal

The list of superior forwards from other countries who are being eclipsed by Klose and now Muller also makes for remarkable reading. To Ronaldo add the two greatest players of all time, Pele and Diego Maradona, and the top two currently playing the game, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Then add Gabriel Batistuta, Ferenc Puskas, Gary Lineker, Eusebio, Christian Vieri, David Villa, Roberto Baggio, Davor Suker, Sandor Kocsis, Romario, Thierry Henry... the list goes on and on.

Yet Klose tops the lot, and Muller could one day usurp his fellow countryman as the World Cup’s goal king. Oh to be a German striker...

Legends: But Ronaldo (left) and Lionel Messi are among the greats who can't compete with Klose's record
