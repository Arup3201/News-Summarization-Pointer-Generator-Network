Celina Hodge, 41, groped a police officer's groin and buttocks while offering him and a colleague a threesome as they tried to give her a breath test

A suspected drink driver groped a policeman while offering him and a colleague a threesome as they tried to give her a breath test.

Celina Hodge, 41, groped the officer’s genitals and buttocks after she was allegedly seen drinking vodka behind the wheel of her car.

The two policemen were attempting to give her a breath test when she touched the officer and made a series of suggestive comments, Bristol Magistrates' Court heard.

Hodge, of Hambrook, Bristol entered a guilty plea to one count of sexual assault but denied failing to provide a sample breath test.

May Li, prosecuting, told the court that Hodge was ‘clearly drunk’ so police officers got her out of the car to perform the breath test.

She said: ‘The officers received reports of a female drinking from a bottle of vodka at the wheel.

‘They located the vehicle where Mrs Hodge was sat in the driver's seat, with the engine off but the keys in the ignition, with a male passenger in the back seat.

‘Mrs Hodge told one officer: “You've got a good ass”. She rubbed her hands over the officer's buttocks and she told him she liked him.’

As she was being arrested, Hodge made sexually suggestive comments to the officers, including offers of sex, the court heard.

Ms Li added: ‘She asked the officers: “Can't we go somewhere just the three of us?”

'She told the Pc he would be a good f*** and repeatedly attempted to rub his groin.’

Later, when officers attempted to get Hodge to give a breath sample at a police station, she began pleasuring herself during the incident on April 25.

Ms Li said: ‘She took hold of the mouthpieces, looked at the CCTV camera, put her leg up on the counter.'

The driver then started to touch herself while blowing into the alcohol tester, she added.

Hodge spoke only to confirm her name and pleas during the ten minute hearing.

She was granted unconditional bail to appear before the same court for the breath test trial on July 11. 

She will be sentenced for the sexual assault at a later date.
