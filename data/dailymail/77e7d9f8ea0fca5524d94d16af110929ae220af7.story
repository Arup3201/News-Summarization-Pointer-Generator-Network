Near a church in the small Spanish town of Olmedo stands a bust of Nick Clegg’s father-in-law, a fitting testament to his civic good deeds.

The Deputy Prime Minister spoke warmly of Jose  Antonio Gonzalez in his  conference speech last week and mentioned with some pride that he was the  town’s first democratically elected mayor.

Mr Clegg is not the first political leader to use inspirational family members to ram home a message. And the point he was making to  Liberal Democrats in  Glasgow was that ‘rights and values should never be taken for granted’.

But The Mail on Sunday has learned that Mr Gonzalez’s triumph in local elections is only part of the story of his political career.

What Mr Clegg neglected to mention was that Mr Gonzalez was already mayor at the time, having been appointed – not elected – during General Francisco Franco’s 36-year dictatorship.

Franco seized power during the Spanish Civil War and ruled subsequently with an iron fist, executing thousands of opponents, banning political parties and demanding unquestioning loyalty.

It was against this background that Mr Gonzalez, a headteacher, entered politics in the early 1970s.

At the time, as with the rest of Spain, Olmedo’s civic leaders were selected by Franco’s regional representative, the provincial civil governor.

Jose Antonio Blanco, who has written a history of Olmedo and served as a socialist councillor, explained: ‘He became deputy mayor and later mayor some months before Franco died in 1975.

‘He would have sworn allegiance to the regime, as all local politicians did. There were no elections, though. No one could question his authority. There was no debate, no democracy. The people did what Senor Gonzalez told them to do. Mr Clegg is  not very well informed.’

During Spain’s transition to democracy after Franco, Mr Gonzalez remained mayor, but was only elected in 1979, by which time, according to Mr Blanco, his political stance had softened to match the mood of the people.

Mr Blanco said: ‘He did do all the things Mr Clegg said he did – improve schools, housing and get people jobs – and in many ways he was a good mayor.

'But much of what he did only came about much later when he was elected as a national senator as well as mayor.’

Mr Blanco believes fervently that in the early days, Mr Gonzalez – a ‘tall, well-dressed, charismatic figure’ – was a Franco ‘sympathiser’.

He claims it would have been ‘practically impossible’ for him to have been appointed mayor during the dictatorship had he been anything else.

It must be said, however, that it is not a view shared, publicly at least, by older residents of Olmedo, where Mr Clegg’s wife Miriam was born in 1968. And neither can Mr Blanco produce hard evidence to support his claim.

‘He was not a sympathiser, he was a good man who did fine things for this town,’ insisted 91-year-old Eloy Rincon Garcia, as he sat in the town square yesterday.

A senior political figure in the town said she too did  not believe that Mr Gonzalez ‘truly’ believed in the Franco regime.

‘The only people who would know would be his family and Jose himself,’ she said. Mr Gonzalez died in a car accident in 1996 at the age of 58.

Yesterday a spokeswoman for Mr Clegg conceded that Mr Gonzalez had first been appointed mayor during the Franco era but said any suggestion he had any sympathy with the regime was ‘utter rubbish, offensive and untrue’.

She added: ‘He was part of the administration before and during the transition to democracy simply because he was head of the local secondary school.

‘He was then elected as the first directly elected mayor and remained the elected mayor for the rest of his life.’

But Mr Blanco questions why anyone who was opposed to Franco would wish to seek office as his representative, even at local level.

‘His political style was certainly very dictatorial,’ he said. ‘He had me expelled from several council meetings and once had the police throw me out when I accused him of favouring another town over Olmedo in a debate about a new school.

‘He adapted to democracy like a lot of people who served under Franco and continued in public life. But there is no doubt he was a product of Franco’s time.’

For Mr Clegg, his wife’s father remains an inspiration. He told his party conference: ‘He was hugely proud of being the first mayor to serve his community through the ballot box.

‘He sadly died some years ago, and there’s a small statue of him today outside the church in Miriam’s village.

‘Our small boys see that statue every holiday. And they always ask about why he was elected and no-one before him. We teach them that democracy and freedom are a fragile and recent thing in many parts of the world.’
