A California fire chief, wanted for the murder of his 26-year-old girlfriend, may have used an escort service to help him escape.

Orville 'Moe' Fleming has been on the run since Sarah June Douglas was found stabbed and strangled in their Sacramento home on May 1.

The 55-year-old may have used from the same escort service he met Miss Douglas through to get help to escape, investigators say.

Victim: Sarah June Douglas was found stabbed and strangled in the home she shared with Orville Fleming, who she met on an escort site

Police believe that Fleming, who had been dating Miss Douglas for two years, had continued to use the escort website after her death.

It is though that he picked up someone he had met on the site just moments after Miss Douglas was stabbed, before fleeing.

'We have information 
that [Fleming] has most likely reached out to someone in the community 
of [Redbook],' Sergeant Lisa Bowman told CBS.

'If he can commit such a heinous and violent murder in the way that he did, we're concerned for the public.'

A state-wide manhunt is underway to find Fleming, who is suspected of murder after the victim's sister identified his voice during an argument she heard during a call to Miss Douglas on the night she died.

Miss Douglas had confided in her mom and sister that her relationship with Fleming was troubled on the night she was murdered.

Attacked: Sarah Douglas had confided in her sister that she planned to end her relationship with Fleming just hours before she was killed

The former escort called her sister, Stephainie, just after midnight on May 1 to say: 'That [SOB] left the gas on. I think he's trying to kill my birds.'

She was then heard saying: 'Whoa, you scared me' before a man the sister later identified as Fleming was heard arguing with her.

Stephanie Douglas said she then heard her sister scream, before the line went dead.

Police believe Miss Douglas had met Fleming through an escort agency she worked at two years ago.

Her profile on the site she used to work for listed her rates as $300 an hour and said she would meet clients around the Sacramento and Bakersfield areas, the Sacramento Bee reported.

Fleming's estranged wife, Meagan, has claimed that Miss Douglas had demanded that she pay off her husband's debts for her escort services.

Ms Fleming told KXTV the young woman had demanded $1,500 and claimed to have a sex tape of her husband.

'She
 said to me and my daughter, if your husband doesn't pay, your husband 
will go to jail, and I have a sex tape with him,' Ms Fleming said.

In November, Ms Fleming had a restraining order made against Miss Douglas.

The former escort had been living with Fleming in the Sacramento home where her body was discovered on May 1.

Her
 sister had dropped round that morning after becoming concerned when she
 couldn't reach Miss Douglas after hearing the argument over the phone 
the night before.

When police entered the home at about 9am that day, they found blood in the laundry room and a bloody towel in the bathroom.

When
 they entered the master bedroom, they found Miss Douglas face down on 
the floor, with a sheet wrapped around her neck. Blood was spattered 
across the walls and floor.

Fleming has not been seen since the stabbed and strangled body of Miss Douglas was discovered.

On
 Thursday, he was fired from his $130,000-a-year job with with the fire 
service because he had failed to turn up for work for five days.

Search: Police have started a state-wide manhunt for Fleming, who is believed to be armed and dangerous

Help: Fleming allegedly reached out to an escort service shortly after the murder of his girlfriend

'This has nothing to do with the 
allegations or the potential criminal charges. It is simply because he 
has not shown up for work for five consecutive work days,' Cal Fire spokesman Daniel Berlant, said.

'Like any 
employee who does not show up, they are separated from the state.'

A state-wide manhunt is in force to try to find Fleming, who authorities have warned could be armed with two pistols.

He also has access to keys that he can use to unlock gates to fire trails across California.

He
 is known to frequent the Sierra Mountains, Santa Cruz Mountains and the
 Yosemite Valley, Sacramento County sheriff's Sergeant Lisa Bowman said.
