Clad in white jodhpurs and blinking in the bright Spanish sunshine, Athina Onassis looked every inch the showjumper as  the opening round of the Furusiyya FEI Nations Cup Jumping Finals got underway in Barcelona yesterday.

Unfortunately, the heiress' bid for the Coca-Cola Trophy came to an early end, after she clocked up 12 faults and was placed 57th out of 63 riders. 

Onassis, 29, who is the only living descendant of Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, was riding grey mare AD Camille Z during the event, which is one of the most prestigious in world showjumping.

Relaxed: Athina, who is famously reclusive, looked relaxed as she chatted to a friend in the ring

Her husband, the Brazilian rider Álvaro de Miranda Neto, 41,  did better and with AD Nouvelle Europe Z, chalked up just two faults and managed a respectable 24th place.

The winner of the Coca-Cola Trophy, however, was Canada's Eric Lamaze  who managed an almost perfect round on his horse Fine Lady.

Veteran Brazilian rider Pedro Veniss took second place with his horse Amemoi O Sandor, while France's Pénélope Leprovost and Sultane Des Ibis came third.

While Onassis might not always get what she wants in her riding career, she has long called the shots in her own life, shrugging off her family's fame and living a quiet life in Brazil's largest city São Paulo with her husband instead.

Top tips: Onassis gets some advice from husband Doda, who eventually managed a 24th place finish

The only child of Christina Onassis, the late shipping tycoon's daughter, she inherited 55 per cent of his fortune - which is believed to be worth billions - on his death. 

Since then, Onassis has dedicated herself to carving out an equestrian career, although an injury last year proved a serious setback.

Onassis, who competes for Greece, is rarely seen in public but has made an unusually large number of appearances in recent months, as her showjumping career hots up.

Most recently, she was spotted competing in London at the Longines Global Champions Tour in August, alongside fellow famous riders, Jessica Springsteen and Sofia Abramovich.

Although she and her husband, who is affectionately known as Doda, failed to put in an appearance at the launch party, she did manage a clear round in the ring  on her bay mare, AD Rose du Valon.
