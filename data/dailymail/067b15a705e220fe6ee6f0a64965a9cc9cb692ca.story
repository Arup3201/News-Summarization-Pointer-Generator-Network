Britain has become the super-rich capital of the world – with more than 100 billionaires living in the UK for the first time.

A total of 104 billionaires now call Britain home, with a combined wealth of £301billion between them, it was revealed yesterday.

It means the UK has more billionaires per head than any other country.

And the vast majority have their homes in London, meaning the capital boasts the greatest number of billionaires of any city in the world, beating New York and Moscow to the top spot.

London has become such a hub for the super-rich that it now accounts for 72 billionaires – almost 10 per cent of all the billionaires in the world.

Moscow has the second highest billionaire population with 48, followed by New York with 43, then San Francisco, Los Angeles and Hong Kong.

But only a third of Britain’s billionaires were actually born British, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.

Indian-born brothers Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja top the UK rich list, with a combined wealth of £11.9billion from their global conglomerate.

They are followed by international tycoons and oligarchs who made their fortunes in aluminium, oil and coal, including Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich.

Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov and Queens Park Rangers stakeholder and steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal also feature.

The only British-born billionaire in the top ten is the Duke of Westminster, who owns swathes of central London and takes tenth place in the list with his £8.5billion fortune.

Britain’s reputation as a financial capital and its relatively low tax regime have been credited for attracting ‘non-dom’ residents, keen to invest in property in London and the South East.

The country now has one billionaire for every 607,692 residents, compared to one for every 1,022,475 in the US, which has the second highest number of billionaires per capita.

Unlike America, Britain does not tax its non-domicile residents on their global wealth, meaning they pay tax only on their UK income.

Francois-Henri Pinault, head of the Gucci fashion empire, is moving to London from France with his actress wife Salma Hayek after the French government introduced a 75 per cent tax rate for the most wealthy, though the couple say this is not the reason for their move.

The number of billionaires in Britain has more than tripled in a decade and their total wealth has now overtaken pre-recession levels of 2008, when the UK’s 75 billionaires were worth £201billion.

Among new British-born members of the billionaire club is West End producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh, who saw his fortune rise to £1billion in the past year.
