When three-year-old Rohid Zamani and his family fled Afghanistan to escape the terrors of the Taliban regime, they could only hope to reach a better place.

But never in their wildest dreams could they have imagined such a spectacular outcome for their little boy.

While the family have built a new life in Britain, Rohid, now 16, has defied overwhelming odds to win a full scholarship to Eton.

Rohid Zamani, 16, who fled Afghanistan to become a student at Sirius Academy, Hull, and now has been accepted for a scholarship at Eton College

His extraordinary story began in the city of Jalalabad, where the Zamanis lived in fear of the extremist Islamic rulers and civil unrest raging around them.

Among the horrors they witnessed was a man who was decapitated because he put gel in his hair to style it.

‘He was dragged out in the street and they chopped his head off,’ said Rohid.

‘There were people getting killed for almost no reason. Every day we were afraid.’

His mother narrowly escaped death after briefly getting out of bed when a relative visited while she was ill.

Rohid said: ‘Moments after she got up a bomb went off and shattered the windows

‘The shards of glass fell on the bed. If my mum had been there she would have been dead.’
Rohid’s father, who worked as a civil 
engineer, decided to risk everything by fleeing the country with his 
wife and two children.

Their journey took them across 3,500 miles, including crossing rivers in Russia in a leaking rubber dinghy.

Rohid said: ‘My mum was scared we were going to sink. She put her hand on the hole.

‘I was really scared. After that we had to wait for a van and the van broke down so we had to go through a forest.

‘There were wolves and dogs, everybody was just so scared.’

The family also became separated at one point.

They spoke no English when they 
arrived in Hull but they soon adapted and were allowed to settle in the 
UK. And Rohid showed his dedication to learning early on.

When the family moved to Birmingham to live near friends, the children weren’t happy.

So Rohid, who was ten at the time, 
took matters into his own hands and phoned his old primary school 
teacher in Hull to ask if he could return.

Headmaster Brian Roberts said: ‘I was working in my office late when I got a call from Rohid.

He said: “Mr Roberts, we are really 
unhappy. If we come back to Hull would it be possible to come back to 
your school?” I said I was sure it was a strong possibility.’

Rohid's ability also bought him to the attention of both Hull KR and Hull FC, who offered him a scholarship

His plan worked. The family returned to Hull and Rohid later joined the city’s Sirius Academy.
As well as being bright and 
hard-working, he excelled at rugby league and athletics. When the school
suggested Rohid apply for an Eton scholarship he jumped at the chance 
and was among hundreds who took part in a tough four-day interview 
process.

‘Luckily I was picked so I must have done OK,’ he said.

He starts at sixth form in September, studying A-levels in maths, biology, chemistry and physics.
Rohid’s father now works as a van 
driver – but the family won’t have to pay a penny of the £30,000 annual 
fees and have been given a £1,500 bursary to help cover school uniform 
and other expenses.

The teenager now knows there is no 
limit to what he can achieve. He hopes to become a surgeon. Commenting 
on the Eton life that awaits him, he said: ‘It’s a huge step, a bit like
going to university two years early.

‘But so long as I keep busy I will be able to adapt.

‘I will miss my family and friends but this is too big an opportunity to pass up.’

Mr Roberts, his old primary school 
head, said of his move to Eton: ‘It doesn’t surprise me that he is going
on to greater things, because he had that vision of where he was going 
in life.’
A spokesman for Eton said yesterday: 
‘We are delighted that Rohid has been awarded one of the sixth form 
scholarships we offer at Eton.

‘He is obviously an extraordinary young man and will undoubtedly make the most of all the opportunities that Eton offers.’
