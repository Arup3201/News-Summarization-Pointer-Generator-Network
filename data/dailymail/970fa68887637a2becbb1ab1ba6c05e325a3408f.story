A mother's leg ballooned to twice its size after she was bitten by what is believed to be a false widow spider.

Shireen Larsen, 33, from Enfield, Middlesex, feared she would lose her leg after an infection from the bite caused the limb to turn black, yellow and covered in huge blisters.

She also began vomiting after being bitten by the venomous creature in the beer garden of the Crown and Horseshoe pub, Enfield.

Ms Larsen initially went to her GP and was given antibiotics, but she had to be rushed to nearby Chase Farm Hospital after the infection caused her leg to double to twice its size.

She spent three days being treated in hospital and is still struggling to walk.  

Ms Larsen, a learning support assistant, said: 'I had to go to the hospital. I was completely petrified; I thought I was going to lose my leg or something worse because of the bite.'

The mother said she watching her daughter and her friend's child play in the garden when she felt a sharp bite on her leg.

She then felt a tingling, followed by a numbness, as the infection began to take hold.

She said: 'I was sitting in the beer garden while my daughter and my friend's child were playing and I felt a sharp bite on my leg.

'I brushed the spider off immediately and my leg started to go numb and felt itchy. My condition deteriorated and I started vomiting and huge blisters swelled up on my leg.' 

Ms Larsen saw her GP, who prescribed her antibiotics. But her condition soon deteriorated and she says her leg doubled in size. Three days later, she went to hospital, fearing she might lose her leg.

Earlier this week, hairdresser Andrea Wallace told how she had to have one of her fingers amputated after a bite from a false widow spider that she sustained in Seaham, Country Durham, led to her catching a flesh-eating bug.

Ms Larsen said: 'At the hospital, the bed was not working properly so I had to prop up my leg with a stool which meant I had a very uncomfortable night's sleep.

'I don't know if it was a false widow or not but the people at the hospital said they had never seen a bite like it before.'

Ms Larsen is now out of hospital. She has been prescribed ten different types of medication.

They've inspired terror into millions, sparking complaints that their danger has been over-hyped. So what are false widow spiders?

Much of their reputation is thought to be thanks to the black widow, which although similarly named is far more dangerous and has been known to kill children, ill or elderly people.

Although its bites can be intensely uncomfortable - swelling hugely when infected - the false widow (above) is not known to have caused any deaths in Britain.

By comparison, around four Britons each year are though to die from bee or wasp stings when they have an allergic reaction.

False widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.

Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, are found across the UK and the population is growing.

Also known by its Latin name Steatoda Nobilis, its first British sighting was in Torquay, Devon, in 1879 and is thought to have remained largely in southern England. 

But the Natural History Museum says warmer summers mean the spider is spreading north, a theory backed by wildlife sightings. 

Describing the spider, she said: 'It was a small dark brown or black spider but it was hard to tell because it was night time.

'I am originally from Zimbabwe and I have seen all sorts of spiders out there but this is the first in this country. You can still see the bite on my leg even now.

'I think people should be made aware that these spiders are out there in Enfield and people should be on the lookout.'

As Britain's most venomous spider species, false widows made headlines last year when victims told how they had suffered huge wounds and almost lost limbs.

An entire secondary school was shut in October last year in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, after an outbreak of the arachnids in its ICT block had to be fumigated.

In the worst cases, suspected bite victims have been treated in hospital or complained of ongoing health problems several months later.

But many experts insist the spiders are not particularly dangerous and will only bite if approached or handled.

There have been no reported deaths from the spiders in Britain, where they are believed to have arrived on crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the 1870s.

It is thought many of the worst reactions happen when bites become infected, rather than being linked to the spider's venom itself.
