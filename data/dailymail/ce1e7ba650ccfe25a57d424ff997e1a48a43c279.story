A male member of the jury that 
acquitted Casey Anthony of the murder of her daughter has said that she 
was a 'horrible person' that none of the jurors liked at all.

Revealing details from inside the 
jury room for the first time, the juror speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said that the 25-year-old 'probably did something wrong'.

He said that if he was able to vote 
again, knowing what he knows about the case now, he would vote for her 
to be convicted of manslaughter.

'Generally, none of us liked Casey 
Anthony at all,' he told People magazine. 'She seems like a horrible 
person. But the prosecutors did not give us enough evidence to convict.

'They gave us a lot of stuff that makes us think that she probably did something wrong, but not beyond a reasonable doubt.'

He said that his life 'has been a nightmare' since Anthony has been released from jail.

'I live in fear that someone will find me. I Google my name every day to see if anyone has figured out who I am,' he said.

He said that one of his friend's wives has banned her husband from talking to him and that his sister has hurled insults at him.

Meanwhile, a Florida appeals court denied a request that would have stopped Casey Anthony from being forced to start a one-year probation sentence for cheque fraud by the end of the week.

The Fifth District Court of Appeals disagreed with Anthony's argument that enforcing the probation order would violate the constitutional prohibition on double jeopardy.

Anthony maintains she already had completed the probation sentence in jail while she was awaiting trial on murder charges in the 2008 death of her two-year-old daughter, Caylee.

'The petitioner and her attorneys were well aware that her probationary placement was not to begin until her release from confinement,' the appellate court said.

The probation order stems from a sentence Circuit Judge Stan Strickland imposed in January 2010 after Anthony pleaded guilty to stealing checks from a friend.

At the time, Strickland said Anthony should serve the probation upon her release, but those instructions never made it into a written order.

The jury member who spoke out also revealed the votes taken by the jurors in the case.

He said that the vote to convict 
Anthony on the four charges of lying to police was unanimous and quick, 
but that the other votes took longer.

'We took the first vote on 
first-degree murder,' he said. 'We were 10 to two to acquit. So we 
talked for about thirty minutes, and the two decided that they were 
willing to change their votes, so first degree was off the table pretty 
quickly.'

Finally the jurors voted on the 
manslaughter charge. 'We did our first vote and it came out half to 
acquit, half to convict,' he said.

'And we talked about it for a while, 
going through the evidence. I'd say that some people got intense, but 
there were no personal attacks, no real yelling.

'And we talked for a while, then it 
was 11-1 to acquit. And the guy who didn't want to acquit basically 
looked at us and said, “OK, whatever you all want.” He knew he wasn't 
going to convince us.'

He said that the jurors then sat there stunned for a few minutes as they realised they were going to set Anthony free.

'Everyone was just stunned at what we
were about to do. [One of the women jurors] asked me, “Are you okay 
with this?” and I said, “Hell, no. But what else can we do? We promised 
to follow the law”.'

The juror said that since the trial 
he has learnt more about the case by reading documents and would now 
consider changing his vote.

'But when we were sequestered, we could only go by what the prosecution and defence gave us, he said.

'If I had to vote now, I'd probably 
vote for manslaughter. But we didn't get the evidence to support it 
before. I know people are mad at us, but we did our jobs, and I think we
did them to the very best of our abilities.'
