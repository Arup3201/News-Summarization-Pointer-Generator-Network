A red brick late-Victorian manor, which stands grandly atop a hill, may look like a pleasant place to live but it actually holds the title of Australia’s Most Haunted House.

Built in 1885 in Junee, in NSW, by local pioneer Christopher William Crawley, the Monte Cristo homestead first reportedly began eliciting signs of paranormal activity in 1963.

Reg and Olive Ryan had just bought the home when they were returning one foggy night and saw an alarming bright light pouring from every window and door of the house.

The Monte Cristo homestead in Junee, NSW, is often called the most haunted house in Australia and is thought to be plagued by the spirits of a young child, a maid and a stable boy

When Port Arthur opened in 1833 it was the destination for the hardest of British criminals. One of the most sighted ghosts is the Lady in Blue who reportedly wails for the child she lost during labour

But when they got to their front door the light was gone and the home was again plunged into darkness.

As the years have gone on, things have only got weirder.

As well as ghostly figures and phantom sounds, Olive once found mutilated cats in her kitchen. The house’s paranormal activity is blamed on the death of a caretaker in the property in 1961 and the imprisonment of a mentally ill man in the house.

Also, when the first family, the Crawleys, lived there a young child was reportedly dropped down the stairs, a maid fell from the balcony and a stable boy burned to death.

Aradale Mental hospital in Victoria opened in 1867 and was once home to some of the most controversial psychiatric treatments in Australia. The treatments would now be described as torture

The North Head Quarantine Station, near the Sydney suburb of Manly, is reportedly haunted by the hundreds of diseased passengers who were stowed there after arriving in Australia by boat

Also in NSW, the North Head Quarantine Station, near the Sydney suburb of Manly, operated from 1832 to  1984 and is supposedly haunted by the ghosts of former staff and patients.

Paranormal activities have been reported in the disused showers where passengers would be forced to strip and in the hospital, where migrant ships arriving in Sydney with suspected contagious diseases off-loaded passengers and crew. 

The Rocks in Syndey's CBD were a place for prostitutes and convicts to mingle in the 19th century and thus the cobbled streets tell many stories.

Visitors to the area can now hear the tales of local murders, suicides, unusual happenings and ghost stories on tours around the historic area.

Up in the South of Cairns in Far North Queensland, at Babinda Creek, a sinister-sounding Devil’s Pool can be found.

Since 1959, 17 young people have lost their lives in the waters of Devil’s Pool but not all the victims were actually swimming at the time of their untimely demise.

At the sacred Aboriginal site, a young couple were once reportedly submerged by water as they stood together on the rock platform admiring the view when. She survived but the boy did not.

According to local folklore, the pool is haunted by the spirit of a young woman who drowned herself there after being separated from her lover. 

The historic area in Sydney's city centre named The Rocks was once a ghetto for the poor around 200 years ago

Beechworth Lunatic Asylum, originally known as the haunted Mayday Hills Lunatic Asylum, is a decommissioned hospital in Victoria.

Ghost tours now run in the building as visitors are regaled with terrifying tales, including the story of James Kelly - uncle of the notorious bush ranger Ned Kelly.

In 1868, James Kelly set fire to the house of his sister in law where a 14 year old Ned was sleeping.

Charged with attempted murder he was originally sentenced to death in June 1868, his sentence however was downgraded to 10 years hard labour.

But when he was released from jail he was then sent to Ararat Lunatic Asylum and later transferred to the Beechworth Lunatic Asylum, where he died on August 26 1903.

Beechworth Lunatic asylum was once home to James Kelly, a criminally insane man who set fire to the house of his sister in law

In the Beechworth Lunatic Asylum in Victoria you can see the freaky looking chairs where people were treated and the old beds 

If you'd rather meet a friendly ghost than a screaming one, the St James Theatre in Wellington is home to the spirit of a dead Russian performer who reportedly saves lives 

One guard stationed at Adelaide Goal between 1986-88 claimed he was once called to an area of the Gaol, as a prisoner was thought to be escaping. A figure was seen on security cameras but when he got there no body was to be found

Also in Victoria is Aradale Mental Hospital, located in Ararat, which opened in 1867.

It’s now Australia's largest abandoned lunatic asylum and is supremely eerie.

It was home to some of the most controversial psychiatric treatments in Australia and around 13,000 people died there in its 130 years.

Meanwhile, Travel Insurance Direct pointed out that in New Zealand, the St James Theatre, in Wellington, has a ‘friendly ghost’.

His name is Yuri and he was a Russian performer who fell to his death several metres above the stage.

Yuri is believed to still call the theatre home, with a projectionist claiming that Yuri has saved his life twice.

One of the most famous of Australia's historic sites is the former convict haven of Port Arthur in Tasmania.  

When Port Arthur was first opened from 1833, until 1853, it was the destination for the hardest of  British criminals.

Hundreds were forced to do their time at the high-security jail and now haunting stories of prisoners whirl around the disused cells.

Often spotted is the ghost of the Lady in Blue, who reportedly wails for the child she lost during labour.

A jail in Adelaide is also a place of spooky sightings. It is one of the oldest remaining  buildings in the city and is the site of some of the state's most grisly history after it opened in 1841.
