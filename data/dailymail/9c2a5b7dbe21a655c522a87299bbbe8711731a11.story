Most afternoons I can be found huffing and puffing my way up Primrose Hill in North London, pushing what feels like the world's heaviest baby in a buggy. 

The view of the city from the top is spectacular but for a few precious days I swapped it for an even better one - with the magnificent backdrop of the Italian Dolomites.

After a two-hour car journey from Innsbruck we were greeted at Rosa Alpina - a five-star, family-owned hotel and spa tucked in a valley in the tiny village of San Cassiano - with a local speciality: a sweet and comforting hot apple juice.

Impossibly neat: Rosa Alpina is nestled in the green foothills of the Italian Dolomites

In the sunshine, the village looked pristine, with pretty wooden chalets stacked against mountain pastures which would have been snow-covered in winter but were now a vivid green. 

The grass was impossibly neat and as I wondered how many cows it must take to maintain, I spotted sit-on mowers weaving up and down the slopes. Completing the alpine scene was a hefty-looking herd with jangling cowbells.

Having picked out a buggy from the hotel lobby, with map in hand we set off on a mountain walk but took the lazy way up - in a cable car.

As the cable car lurched, my four month-old daughter Romilly wobbled in my lap, lip trembling; looking back down the mountain and up to the peak seemed a long way off.

I began to doubt my fitness for what was my first post-baby trip away - billed as a Yummy Mummy healthy strolling break.

I had feared craggy paths at the summit, precariously winding round the mountain, but found gentle, undulating trails. There was a restaurant, playground, park and fountain.

It was as family friendly as the nursery department at John Lewis. Families and groups were starting out or finishing walks, with children in backpacks and buggies, or just jogging alongside their parents, perfectly content without a gadget in sight.

Some were Nordic walking, others speed hiking. Would this sort of family outing happen back home? Not likely and what a shame.

Instead of craggy, unforgiving trails, Sarah found undulating trails in the mountains perfect for buggies

The views were awesome and the air so pure I took in great gulps in the hope it might benefit my London-worn lungs. We could have easily taken a different trail each day of the week.

At one hilltop restaurant, deckchairs overlooked the spectacular view like a sort of mountain beach, and children played on swings.

For a different view of the mountains, the larch trail runs through meadows and up into the mountains opposite the hotel. 

It makes for a wonderful outing for energetic children (and their parents) and Rosa Alpina has produced a brilliant educational booklet which encourages little ones to look out for flora and fauna, plus answer questions on their surroundings.

Tucked up inside at Rosa Alpina, the rooms were wonderfully warm - all sweet-smelling pine and herringbone fabrics - but come dusk it was far too tempting to resist lighting the wood fire.

Perhaps it was the mountain air, but bedtime passed without a murmur from Romilly, who was spoilt with a beautifully made-up cot and goodie bag including baby slippers, towelling robe and a cuddly bear.

Adults get treats too - of the culinary variety. Rosa Alpina boasts St Hubertus, a stunning Michelin-starred restaurant, where chef Norbert Niederkofler uses seasonal vegetables (no tomatoes in winter) and 90 per cent local produce.

Romilly and I sank into a neat routine: a walk after breakfast, a swim after lunch. The peace was enough to move me to tears.

For my daughter to experience so little intrusive sound apart from cockerels, cowbells and church bells was bliss. My ideal partner (apart from my partner) on the trip would have been my mother.

The walks here are challenging enough to invigorate but easy enough to be a comfortable, Clare Balding-type ramble. I began to wonder if Romilly would grow up craving a life of outdoor activities, of escaping and exploring.

As a quote from Fred Astaire painted on the wall of the pool said: 'Old age is like everything else - to have success in it you have to start young.'

Rosa Alpina (rosalpina.it) offers double rooms from £235 per night including breakfast. EasyJet (easyjet.com) flies from Gatwick to Innsbruck with one-way fares from £28.99.
