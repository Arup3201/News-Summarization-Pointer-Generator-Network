A couple who were seriously injured in the Boston Marathon bombings this April have celebrated the birth of their first child together.

Caroline Reinsch, 39, and Christian Williams, 42, first found out they were to become first-time parents when they were rushed to ER following the horrific terror attacks.

They revealed to MailOnline that they welcomed a little girl called Marlowe to the world on December 18 - six days before her due date - weighing a healthy 6lbs 14oz.

Hello baby Marlowe! Caroline Reinsch and Christian Williams, who were seriously injured in the Boston Marathon bombings this April have celebrated the birth of their first child together

Reflecting on the whirlwind chain of events, Mr Williams said: 'I don't think that Caroline or I view Marlowe's conception as a miracle.

'But, we do think that her timing was quite miraculous.

'When we could have been focusing on the hardships of recovery, we instead turned our attention on our future as a family. It was just what we needed.'

Bright-eyed: The couple picked the girls' name Marlowe because of its 'uniqueness and beauty' and they liked the nickname, 'Marley'

Mr Williams, who works as a filmmaker and photographer, originally met Ms Reinsch through his sister several years ago.

They ran the Boston Marathon together in 2012, raising thousands of dollars for charity, but this year attended the race to cheer on a friend.

They settled for a spot beneath the flags near to the finish line.

As the terrifying blast went off on April 15, Mr Williams' legs and right hand were ripped open, and Ms Reinsch suffered a bloody hole in her thigh and a split quad muscle.

Safety: Ms Reinsch is pictured on the day of the bombings, unaware she was a couple of weeks pregnant

Images from the day show her being rushed away on a stretcher, while Mr Williams is seen on the ground; she went to Faulkner Hospital and he was taken to Beth Israel.

'Is there a possibility you are pregnant?' an X-ray technician asked her when she arrived at the hospital, and she answered that no, she didn't think she was.

'Discovering that I was going to be a father is how I'll always remember the Marathon'

The couple had been trying to conceive since fall 2012 without any luck.

When Ms Reinsch left the hospital after 11 days, her first stop was Beth Israel, where she had an emotional reunion with her boyfriend, who was coming out of his sixth surgery.

Mr Williams had survived the blast but doctors were still trying to save his right leg.

A
 few days later, Ms Reinsch's doctor called to talk over her discharge 
papers and asked if she had been given a pregnancy test.

Big surprise: Ms Reinsch's doctor told her to take a test after her discharge papers showed a 'slight positive' for pregnancy

Records showed a 'slight positive' but it was too early to tell for sure.

Ms Reinsch was advised to take a home pregnancy test - which was positive - before taking another in a hospital restroom down the hall from Mr Williams' room. Again, it turned positive.

Back in his room, she told him: 'I have something for you' - before handing over the little stick.

She learned that she must have been just one or two weeks pregnant when the bomb went off. They decided to go public with their news on Father's Day.

'Discovering that I was going to be a father is how I'll always remember the Marathon,' Mr Williams said at the time.

Learning to move on: The couple say they will 'never quite return to 100per cent' of what they were before the Boston Marathon bombings

Following the birth of their baby, he and Ms Reinsch told MailOnline that they 'feel very much like all other first-time parents. We're excited, nervous, optimistic, and hopeful.'

They spent Christmas introducing their newborn to friends and family.

Mr Williams says that he and Ms Reinsch will 'never quite return to 100per cent' of what they were before the Boston Marathon bombings.

Although they no longer have to wear leg braces, their limbs remain scarred and the emotional turmoil lingers.

Mr Williams is also set to go in for another surgery on his right hand in January.

The blast partially 'degloved' his hand meaning he had no skin left on his last three fingers.

To pay for medical expenses not covered by insurance a friend of Mr Williams and Ms Reinsch's set up a gofundme.com crowdfunding page. Currently it has raised $111,836.

Summing up 2013 in three words, Mr Williams said: 'Fortunate and blessed.'
