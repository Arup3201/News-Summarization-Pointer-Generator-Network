Deborah Arthurs In Shanghai

In a glittering event that will (probably) see Cara Delevingne and Suki Waterhouse take Shanghai by storm (VIP details are as yet unconfirmed, but let’s face it, they HAVE to be there...) Burberry tonight officially launches its largest store in Asia.

Despite the fact the brand has kept its celebrity guest list and details of the event a closely-guarded secret, the two arrived in Shanghai earlier this week and have been merrily Instagramming photos of themselves around the city ever since.

So naturally, we put two and two together...and decided that they will of course be there (more details to follow this evening when the event begins at around 8pm Shanghai time, 1pm GMT).

The event, entitled London In Shanghai, will be held at a shipping yard in the sprawling metropolis, with VIPs dressed in Burberry’s latest Gold collection (exclusive to the new store) bringing a classic Burberry performance to the guests, a mix of private invitees and competition winners.

True to Burberry’s position as global leaders in social media and interactivity, they won’t just leave this one to be Snapchatted by a few crowd members either.

They have partnered up with China’s largest and fastest-growing social media site, WeChat, with 600m members and counting. Big hitters on the site, like actors Angelababy, Vicki Zhao, Chen Kun and Dou Xiao have up to 80m followers each, dwarfing even Justin Bieber’s loyal Twitter headcount.

The store itself, in the gleaming Kerry Centre mall in Shanghai's Jing An district, pays tribute to the UK Regent Street flagship that opened in September 2012.

Party people: While it hasn't been confirmed that the supermodels will be attending, Cara and Suki are the stars of the event's teaser video so one can only presume...

It is smaller, but the design echoes that of its London counterpart, with a vast, open ‘landing page’ area (like the London store, the intention is that you feel almost as though you have walked into the Burberry.com website, with the digital experience brought to life in a physical space) that plays host to a free-standing screen beaming out catwalk footage and a sweeping Corinthian stone staircase leading up to two more floors.

It is not only the largest Burberry store in Asia to date, but it also carries the largest beauty room, watch room and Prorsum collection.

Anything else? Oh yes - interactive mirrors that respond when you approach with a garment to feed you related content - a catwalk show, perhaps, or information about the fabric. The only thing they don’t do is tell you how awesome you look (Burberry - could you look into that for us please?!).

The icing on the cake though is an intelligent glass facade that reacts to the weather and can change accordingly. By night it is lit up with the heritage Burberry check across the building; by day it responds to natural light or rain to present itself in different guises - something that 121 Regent Street, with its beautiful old stone exterior, cannot match.

Furniture and fittings are all British-designed, and the window display is given over to the Heritage collection - a celebration of the trench distilled down to its very essence, with three classic takes on the trench for women - The Kensington, The Sandringham and The Westminster (men have four) -  each tweaked just slightly to offer a slimmer cut or tapered waist, for example.

It is eminently shoppable, and something to satisfy those of us who lust after the python or buttersoft leather trenches that run into the thousands but can’t quite justify buying them.

Of course, there are those who will just buy both. Sigh.
