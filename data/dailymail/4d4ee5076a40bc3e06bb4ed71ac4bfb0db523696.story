Businesses yesterday backed a minister who triggered controversy by saying young people lack the ‘grit’ to get jobs.

Nick Hurd was criticised after saying qualities such as ‘confidence, discipline and self-control’ were not being taught at school, in an interview with the Mail.

But yesterday business leaders and even senior Labour MPs lined up to agree that many teenagers have been left ill-equipped for the job market.

Validated: Mr Hurd's comments caused controversy on Tuesday but he has since been proven right as business leaders rush to confirm his theories

Neil Carberry, a director at the CBI, said: ‘What employers tell us is very much around grit, tenacity, self-determination to get on with colleagues, which is what Nick Hurd is talking about.

‘The Government has rightly pushed for more rigorous exams, but there is also space in the curriculum for character skills. Head teachers are only judged on their GCSE results, but I think all-round attitude and aptitude need to be taken into account.’

Mike Cherry, policy chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, said a survey of their members found that more than 60 per cent are not confident they can find the right young person to fill a job.

Mr Cherry added: ‘I think he [Mr Hurd] highlights the issue and the Government has to look hard at how to deal with it.

'They [employers] need young people with numeracy, literacy but also employability skills, including soft skills, right down to how to dress properly and what to do and say when they turn up.’

From yesterday's Mail

Mr Hurd, an Old Etonian and 
fourth-generation Tory MP, was criticised yesterday by Labour’s work and
pensions spokesman Liam Byrne who said he was ‘out of touch’ and should
come and meet ‘angry young people’ in his Birmingham constituency.

Teresa Pearce, a Labour MP on the Commons work and pensions select committee, said: ‘Although I can agree with the point I think he is trying to make ... it is clumsily put by him and more than a little insensitive for an old Etonian whose CV reads more like an entry in Who’s Who than a list of real-life work experience.’

Mr Hurd, the Minister for Civil Society, had said: ‘What we see in survey after survey is employers saying qualifications are important but that just as important to us are so-called soft skills, character skills, the ability to get on with different people, to articulate yourself clearly, confidence, grit, self-control, and they are saying we are not seeing enough of this in kids coming out of schools.’

Mr Hurd, whose department is in charge of the National Citizen Service which helps young people develop these skills, took to Twitter to defend his remarks, saying he was not criticising teenagers. He wrote: ‘It is employers raising concerns about how work-ready many young people are.’

Labour’s Tristram Hunt, a shadow education minister, said he agreed entirely with Mr Hurd’s comments about ‘grit’.

‘It’s the right message but the tragedy is the Government have allowed services such as youth clubs, which are shown to improve employability, to wither on the vine.’
