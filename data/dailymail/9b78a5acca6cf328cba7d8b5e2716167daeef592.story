When most people think of Theodore Roosevelt, they think of a rough-riding, bear-wrestling frontiersman who tamed the Wild West and who once was shot in the chest at point-blank range but couldn't be bothered with going to the hospital.

While many of the legends about the 26th president of the United States are genuine, one of the more iconic pieces of Roosevelt imagery, it turns out, is a fraud.

One of the more-famous photos of the leader of the original Rough Riders shows him riding a moose across a body of water. But, as a curator at a Harvard University library has discovered, the image was the product of nothing more than a very basic form of Photoshop.

Bull Moose: After leaving the presidency, Roosevelt created the Bull Moose Party and ran for president again as the Bull Moose candidate

Heather Cole, curator of the university's Theodore Roosevelt book collection, has discovered that the photo was simply doctored to make Roosevelt appear as though he was riding a bull moose as part of a newspaper's coverage of the 1912 presidential election, in which Roosevelt was running as a candidate from the newly formed Progressive 'Bull Moose' Party.

The photo was created by the photography firm Underwood and Underwood and used in a collage titled The Race for the White House.'

The collage was published in the New York Tribune on September 8, 1912. Without the back-story of the whole collage, the photo of Roosevelt has been repeatedly taken out of context when viewed by itself as a candid photo of President Roosevelt. But as part of the bigger picture of the collage as a whole, a photographer altering the image to include a moose makes much more sense.

The other two men in the original collage were President William Howard Taft riding an elephant and Woodrow Wilson saddled up on the back of a donkey. Taft was running as a Republican, while Wilson was running as a Democrat. The symbolic animals for those parties are an elephant and a donkey, respectively.

So, as the founding father of the Bull Moose Party, it only made sense to put Roosevelt on the back of a giant moose.

Over the years, as photos emerged of Roosevelt wrangling horses and killing rhinoceroses, it didn't seem too far-fetched that he could woo a moose into giving him a lift across a river.

Cole theorizes that Underwood used a photo of Roosevelt riding a horse and then carefully taped it over a photo of the moose to make it appear as though he was riding it.

Also visible, as Cole points out, is the white line scratched or painted on the photo to approximate a ripple made by Roosevelt's leg in the water.
