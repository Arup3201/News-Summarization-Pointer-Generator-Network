The Vatican's semi-official newspaper has angered supporters of euthanasia and abortions by suggesting they apply the same justifications that were used by the Nazis to 
champion their murderous eugenics programme.

The controversial claim that they believe in the survival of the fittest concept, was made in an article on the front page of today's issue of L'Osservatore RomanO.

It was published in response to the recent Italian translation of a 1920 book  titled Allowing the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Living, by two German scholars, Karl Binding and Alfred Hoche.

It is written by Lucetta Scaraffia, an Italian historian who frequently has work published in the Vatican paper, reports the Huffington Post.

'Contempt for imperfect human life, over
estimation of the abilities of science' are 'still firmly present in 
our time,' she states.

Response: Her article was in response to the recent Italian translation of a 1920 book by two German scholars, Karl Binding, pictured, and Alfred Hoche

The book she is discussing set the agenda for the Nazi programme of extermination -Â  they believed that select people did not have the right to survive, such as disabled or terminally ill patients.

It promotes the idea that people who are seriously or terminally ill or have a mental or physical disability were 'unworthy of being lived,' and should be given a 'charitable death.'

In the article Scaraffia argues that this viewpoint on whether a life should be ended is present in the 'writings of many contemporary bioethicists, and 
of many politicians who support legislative proposals of a euthanastic 
type.'

The historian asserts that the book is 'sinisterly' relevant to current debates.

She
writes that it should 'strongly embarrass those who champion euthanasia
in the belief that it has nothing to do with Nazism,' reports the Huffington Post.

Controversial link: Her claims are controversial as many pro-choice campaigners who support assisted suicide and abortions may object to Scaraffia comparing them to a regime which was responsible for the death of millions of people during World War Two

Another bold claim is that 'eugenics is still alive and has not been wiped out together with the Nazi past.'

Her claims are controversial as many pro-choice campaigners who support assisted suicide and abortions have objected to Scaraffia comparing them to a regime which was responsible for the death of millions of people during World War Two.
