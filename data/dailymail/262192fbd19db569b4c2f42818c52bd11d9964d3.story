Two Boston men previously believed to have been ‘cured’ of HIV are showing traces of the virus in their blood.

Researchers said the fact that the two men were showing signs of the virus means that it can lurk in places in the body where it is hard to find.

Dr. Timothy Henrich, associate professor of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, announced the resurgence of the virus at an international conference on AIDS research in Florida on Thursday, according to the Boston Globe.

Not cured: Researcher Timothy Henrich, who said in July that the men were cured of HIV, said on Thursday that traces of the virus had been found again

He said the findings suggest that they need to look for the virus in other tissues, such as the liver, gut and brain.

‘These are all potential sources, but it’s very difficult to obtain tissue from these places so we don’t do that routinely.’

The two, unnamed, HIV-positive men made 
headlines in July, when Henrich announced that they were no longer 
showing any detectable traces of HIV in their body.

The patients had received stem cell transplants after they had been diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, and doctors believed this transplant had allowed their body to get rid of the virus.

They had stopped taking antiretroviral medications for 15 weeks and seven weeks respectively at the time of the announcement.

The
second patient decided to stay off the medication, but eight months 
after he had been ‘cured’ the doctors found traces of HIV. He was placed
on antiretrovirals again.

Stem cells: The men had received stem cell transplants for Hodgkin's lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, and doctors believed at the time this transplant had allowed their body to get rid of the virus

According to government estimates, about 1,148,200 persons 13 and older were infected with HIV in the U.S. in 2009. Around 18.1 per cent of those people had not been diagnosed yet.

Another man, Timothy Ray Brown, known as the 'Berlin patient', similarly announced that he had been cured of HIV when he received a stem cell transplant.

Brown, who had leukemia, received a donation from a person with a genetic mutation called CCR5-delta32, which makes people HIV-resistant.

Researchers said in July 2012 that they 
found traces of HIV in Brown’s blood, but he claimed those viruses are 
dead and cannot replicate, according to CBS News.

Resistant DNA: Brown received a donation from a person with a genetic mutation called CCR5-delta32, which makes people HIV-resistant

The Boston men's stem cell donors did not have the CCR5-delta32mutation.

A Mississippi baby born HIV-positive was also determined to be cured of the virus after she was given powerful three-drug infusion within 30 hours after birth.

The mother had not been diagnosed with HIV until she was in labor, and did not receive any prenatal treatments to prevent the spread of the virus to her baby.

Researchers said in October the baby still appears to be HIV-free.

Henrich said that despite the failure to eradicate HIV from the two men, researchers learned a lot that would allow them to make improvements for future treatments.

‘We go back to the drawing board,’ Henrich said. ‘It’s exciting science, even if it’s not the outcome we would have liked.’
