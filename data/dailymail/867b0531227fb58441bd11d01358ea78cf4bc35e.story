Tottenham have commissioned engineering firm M Anderson Construction to oversee the building of their new stadium in a £50m deal, council documents reveal.

The company, based in Chelmsford in Essex, will be responsible for the stadium's foundations and also the construction of its super structure, including upper floors and stairways.

The new ground will be located at Northumberland Park, next to White Hart Lane, and is expected to be completed in 2018.

M Anderson built the club's training facility in Enfield and will now take on the project to engineer Tottenham's new state-of-the-art 56,000-capacity home.

Documents seen by Sky Sports News confirmed: 'THFC have today entered into a Joint Contracts Tribunal (JCT) Design and Build Contract for the civil engineering ground works, concrete foundations and structure for the new THFC Stadium Project.

'The contract has been made with M Anderson Construction Ltd and the sum for the works is £49,773,727.'

Construction workers start the demolition of building around White Hart Lane in readiness for the new ground

The new ground, which has yet to be named, will have a capacity of 56,250 

Haringey Council have approved the contract though Spurs must overcome an outstanding High Court challenge, from Archway Street Metal Works Ltd, the one remaining landowner on the site, before building work can commence.

The council have already given permission for the club to demolish Fletcher House, a listed building on the site.

Tottenham will have to find a temporary home while the as-yet-unnamed stadium is completed, with Wembley, stadium:MK and Upton Park under consideration.
