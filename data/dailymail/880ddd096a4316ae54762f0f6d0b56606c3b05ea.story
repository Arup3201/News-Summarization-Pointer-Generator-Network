A HIV-positive mother-of-four, who contracted the disease from her deceased husband, has shared her inspiring story in an effort to break down stigma surrounding the life-long illness.

Debra was completely unaware of her husband Gary's condition until he became gravely ill with a bout of acute pneumonia in 1995.

After 10 years of being happily married and living a normal suburban life, Debra was shocked and angered when tests revealed that her husband was HIV positive.

Debra, 50, has been living with HIV for the last 20 years after contracting it unknowingly from her husband

After finding out Gary had contracted the disease by having sex with men and using drugs intravenously, she was appalled when tests revealed she had also contracted the disease from her husband.

'How dare he do this to me,' Debra told SBS's program The Feed.

'I still call him a bastard for doing it, the bastard who put us at risk; not only me, but his children. How could he be so selfish?'

Luckily, tests showed that Debra and Gary's three children were HIV negative.

Despite her fury, Debra still nursed her husband on his death bed for 11 months after the pneumonia caused his immune system to fail, changing his HIV to full blown AIDs.

Debra had been married to Paul for 10 years when he was admitted to hospital with acute pneumonia, which later revealed he was HIV positive

Tests confirmed that Debra had contracted the disease from her husband, but luckily their three children proved to be HIV negative

'I just got on with it. And also I needed my kids to know that they can never turn around to me and say "why didn't you look after daddy?".

'He gave me 3 beautiful children. I love him for that, I will always will love him for that, but I hate him so much at the same time.'

Debra has now been living with HIV for almost 20 years.

However with treatment, she has been able to live a completely normal life, even finding herself a new partner, Paul.

After nursing her husband for 11 months on his death bed, Debra met Paul (pictured) and they have been together ever since, even conceiving a health boy, now aged 15

Debra has spoken out about her illness to beat social stigma and prove that with the help of medication, she lives  a normal healthy life

Paul and Debra met 12 months after Gary died and have been inseparable ever since, even having a completely healthy baby together 15 years ago by following professional medical advice.

Paul, who is HIV negative, says he's neither frightened by Deb's illness nor concerned about contracting it himself.

But not everyone is so accepting of the illness, with stigma a common factor, particularly for the small proportion of women in Australia who live with the disease.

'Thereâ€™s still such a stigma with it, but I'm sick of being ashamed of what I have. I'm over the "HIV is a bad thing",' Debra said.

'I'm a normal mum, I'm a normal woman and I'm just getting on with my life and HIV is just a small part of my life.'
