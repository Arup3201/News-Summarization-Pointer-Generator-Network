From a perfectly sculpted snowman riding a bicycle to a dog lover taking his Alaskan malamutes for their first ever sledding experience in the unlikely location of Barnes Park in Sunderland, Tyne & Wear - your pics are helping us capture Britain as it is swept by snow.

Whether
it be a snow-topped castle, or a blizzard in full force, we are asking 
our readers across the UK to send in their best pictures, capturing the 
effects of 2013's first cold snap.

Readers from all corners of the UK - from Plymouth to Middlesbrough - have already been sending their snow-tinged pictures.

If
it is beautiful scenery you have captured or just somebody having fun, 
help us share the experience with readers across the country.

Are you out frolicking in the snow? Email all your pictures to mailonlinepictures@dailymail.co.uk
