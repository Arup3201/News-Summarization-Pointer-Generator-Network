Eight parking spaces in central London have gone on sale for £2.25million, or £281,000 per space, which is nearly £10,000 more than the average British home.

The spaces are on a tarmac-covered forecourt under a block of flats in Mayfair, one of the capital's most exclusive, and expensive, districts.

Estate agent Carter Jonas is marketing the whole forecourt, which can host eight cars - as long as they're not billionaire's favourite Maybachs - on a 900-year lease.

The forecourt is open to the elements and costs £2.25million but is in the smart central London area of Mayfair

The £2.25million price tag divided by eight equates to £281,250 per space, which is £7,250 more than the £274,000 national average house price. 

And given that it is merely a lease on the parking spaces that is being sold, the new owner will still have to pay £100 a year in ground rent.

The spaces, which are close to the heavily-guarded US Embassy and Berkeley Square, are underneath an apartment block where the last recorded sale was £2.3million for a three-bed flat.

And while the spaces are in a central location, they don't offer much in the way of security for any expensive cars parked there - there is just a metal chain skirting the forecourt's boundary.  

The estate agent says the space can fit eight cars, as long as they are not the billionaire's favourite Maybachs

The estage agent's property listing says: 'A rare opportunity to purchase an entire private forecourt consisting of eight parking spaces in prime Mayfair.

'Located just off Charles Street on a landmark building and held on a 900-year lease, this unique plot is for sale as a whole, not as separate lots.'

Another estate agent, Thackerays, describes the property as having a 'minimum of seven' spaces and highlights a £100 ground rent.

This summer, three spaces went on a sale in a car park in nearby Park Lane for a total of £255,000, or £85,000 each.

According to the Parkopedia website, parking in the surrounding streets costs £4.40 an hour, which works out at an annual cost of £38,544.

House prices reached a new all-time high of £274,000 on average in August after surging by 11.7per cent year-on-year, according to official figures.

Growth in property values in London continued to outstrip the rest of the UK, with prices in the capital leaping by 19.6per cent year-on-year to stand at £514,000 typically in August, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data showed.

Average house prices in London pushed over the £500,000 mark for the first time in July. 

Prices across the country jumped by 0.6per cent month on month in August, which was a weaker increase than a 1.6per cent monthly uplift recorded in July.

House prices reached a record high in August but the market is said to be softening, particularly in London

Many other reports covering developments in the housing market in recent weeks have pointed to the pace of house price growth softening, particularly in London following the capital's strong run of increases.

These reports have suggested that speculation over interest rate rises, tougher mortgage lending conditions and potential buyers baulking at some of the prices being demanded by sellers are prompting the start of a calmer phase for the housing market in the coming months.

A first-time buyer typically faces paying 12.9per cent more for a home than they did a year ago, with the price of a starter home now standing at around £210,000, the ONS figures showed.
