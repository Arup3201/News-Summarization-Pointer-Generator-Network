These photographs show how properties along the Thames have been ruined by river levels reaching a ten-year high on some stretches.

The pictures from Surrey come as communities in the South were warned they were still at risk of flooding from swollen rivers and saturated ground.

On Sunday, which was the peak of flooding along the Thames, around 400 tonnes of water per second flowed along the river at Windsor.

And levels along many parts of the Thames - including Purley, Henley, Marlow and Maidenhead - reached a decade-long high.

There are currently 18 Environment Agency flood warnings and 98 flood alerts in place for England and Wales, with the majority in the South.

Difficult times: A man carries his shopping through flood water as he makes his way to his flooded home adjacent to the River Thames near Shepperton, Surrey

Troubled: The Environment Agency has recorded a 10-year high for the water level on several stretches of the River Thames. Sunbury in Surrey is pictured

Full of water: A greenhouse is flooded from high water from the Thames near Sunbury. Communities in the South were warned they were still at risk of flooding

Good time for a boat: The risk of flooding remains along the Thames (pictured), and river levels are still high in parts of Hampshire, Surrey, West Sussex and Wiltshire

The risk of flooding remains along the
 Thames, and river levels are still high in parts of Hampshire, West 
Berkshire, Surrey, West Sussex and Wiltshire.

Thames
 warnings were out today for Horton, Chertsey, Old Windsor, Wraysbury, Purley,
 Henley, Remenham, Medmenham, Shiplake and Wargrave.

More
 showers and some rain are forecast for this week - but far from what was
 seen over Christmas, so the river levels were not expected to rise soon.

There
 is still concern in the Somerset Levels, where villages have been cut 
off by floods, but levels have stabilised and are starting to fall in 
some places.

However, groundwater levels remain very high in Dorset and Wiltshire, and continue to rise in some southern areas.

Carrying on: Pallets are used as a raised walkway into a flooded home adjacent to the River Thames near Sunbury

No play today: A playground is flooded from high water from the river Thames near Sunbury. More showers and some rain are forecast for this week

Thames floods: The latest estimates show that 640 homes and businesses had flooded in England since the beginning of January

Shepperton damage: The bad weather since the New Year followed a stormy Christmas period with high winds and heavy rain causing flooding and disruption

John Curtin, head of incident response at
 the Environment Agency, said: ‘There is a continued risk of flooding in
 southern England, especially Somerset and Wiltshire, and we urge people
 to remain vigilant and prepared to take action.

John Curtin, Environment Agency

‘Environment Agency teams are 
out on the ground, maintaining flood defences, clearing watercourses and
 deploying pumps and temporary defences to protect communities at risk.’

The latest estimates show that 640 homes and businesses had flooded in England since the beginning of January.

The bad weather since the New Year 
followed a stormy Christmas period with high winds and heavy rain 
causing flooding and disruption.

But
 the EA said the Thames Barrier was shut 13 times in a row in early 
January, defending £200billion-worth of property and infrastructure in 
London.

Broken fence: The rain forecast for this week is far from what was seen over Christmas, so the river levels are not expected to rise. Shepperton is pictured

Orange and red: There are currently 18 flood warnings and 98 flood alerts in place in England and Wales, with the majority in the South-East and South-West

Forecast: Tomorrow, it will be a bright and breezy day with sunny spells, but cloud may be more extensive across much of Scotland where fog may struggle to lift

Along with two closures in December, more than 10 per cent of all closures in 
its 30-year history took place between early December and 
mid-January.

Tonight will be mostly cloudy across Britain with showery bursts of rain tracking eastwards, accompanied by thunder in the South.

But the rain will ease away to the East during the early hours leaving a mixture of clear periods and scattered showers.

Tomorrow, it will be a bright and breezy day with sunny spells, but cloud may be more extensive across much of Scotland where fog may struggle to lift.

There will also be scattered heavy showers - most frequent in the South and West. Hail and thunder are possible in any heavier showers.
