Joe Root was forced to deal with criticism from too close to home for comfort but was adamant that England are on the right path to one-day riches.

The demolition of England’s one-day approach by Graeme Swann and Michael Vaughan in a BBC wet-weather radio debate was eye-catching because Swann in particular has so recently stepped outside of the team environment.

Hope: Root is convinced that the Test players who defeated India will prove equally adapt at the shorter game

Yet Root, a flag carrier for the new England after an outstanding summer, is convinced that the Test players who defeated India will prove equally adapt at the shorter game when the one-day series makes its belated introduction on Wednesday.

The crux of Swann and Vaughan’s argument is that England’s 50-over cricket remains in the dark ages under a captain in Alastair Cook who should have rested up after proving his Test point and left this to the big-hitting kids.

Not so, said Root, who hopes England will prove one of their best captains and one of their greatest spinners wrong, starting against India at Cardiff.

‘I think guys have been picked because they’re very capable of making big scores in one-day games,’ said the man who will one day replace Cook as captain in both formats.

‘We’ve prepared really well and it’s exciting for us. Those guys are paid for their opinions and they are entitled to give them, but we know where we are as a side. We are comfy and ready to go.’

England must have thought Cook’s position would have ceased to be an issue after runs and three successive Test wins but Root, who scored more than 700 runs in the Test summer, was obliged to come to the captain’s defence.

‘He’s our leader in one-day cricket as well as Tests, he’s done well over a number of years and we all back him,’ said Root of Cook. ‘He’s a fantastic player and has got all our support. His style complements players like Alex Hales and hopefully that can be shown this series. We want to show what we can do as a one-day outfit. I don’t think there’s much of a problem with the batting.’

The argument is a fascinating one. England, yet to win a World Cup and outsiders in next year’s tournament in Australia and New Zealand, were widely expected to introduce more than just Hales from the next generation here.

But a combination of outstanding performances in the last three Tests from the likes of Gary Ballance and Moeen Ali coupled with the largely poor form of the Lions top order against New Zealand A this season forced a partial re-think.

Certainly Swann’s assertion that England ‘do not have a cat in hell’s chance’ in the next World Cup seems a bit over the top when, in effect, they will only need to put three good 50-over displays together against decent opposition to win in Australia and New Zealand because of the World Cup’s flawed format.

Cook proved Mike Atherton wrong when he was labelled a ‘plodder and a donkey’ after becoming one-day captain three years ago. Now, starting at the Swalec Stadium, he has the chance to do the same to Swann and Vaughan.

Had his say: Vaughan admits Cook proved him wrong but says England's one-day game is unncessary
