A postal worker suspected of thieving was embarrassed to be caught on CCTV stealing penis enlargement pills from a parcel.

Stephan Brooks was spotted by his manager using a penknife to slice open post at his job at the Royal Mail sorting office in Chelmsford, Essex.

The 47-year-old from Benfleet, Essex was put under two days of surveillance and caught on camera helping himself to a pot of VigRX - a penis enlargement supplement - from a parcel he had opened up.

Staff watched as Brooks opened up parcel after parcel, checking contents before putting them back if they were of no interest.

During a second day of CCTV surveillance he used his knife to open seven more packages and stole cash.

When Brooks was confronted by security staff he resigned from his job and asked that he be allowed to turn himself in to police.

Brooks was handed a six-month suspended sentence at Chelmsford Magistratesâ€™ Court after admitting two counts of theft and three charges of unlawfully opening Royal Mail packages.

He was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work in the community.

Other items Brooks nabbed included Ray-Ban sunglasses, a designer watch, cufflinks and a harmonica.

John Downing, chairman of the bench, told Brooks: 'You have pleaded guilty to five offences of premeditated thefts which is a serious breach of trust and causes an erosion of public confidence in the postal service.'

Speaking afterwards James Eadie, spokesman for the Royal Mail, said: 'Every item of mail is important to us.

'Royal Mail has a zero-tolerance approach to any dishonesty and this stance is shared by the overwhelming majority of postmen and women who are honest and hard-working and who do all they can to protect the mail and deliver it safely.

'We will always seek to prosecute the tiny majority of people who abuse their position of trust.'
