One inventor from Quebec, Canada has invented a brand new toy that can cut through the snow like a chainsaw--because it is a sort of chainsaw and about a dozen other things.

Yvon Martel crafted the MIT-136, a motorized vehicle that can pull a sled, storm through and over large amounts of snow, push vehicles that have become stuck in the snow or mud, pull logs from the woods, attach to a snowmobile, act as an electrical power source for chainsaws, and more.

MTT stands for 'My Track Technology' and can fit almost all or all any snow explorer's needs.

Just Car News reports that the machine is simply an aluminum box with a tread track attached to it powered by an electric motor and a battery pack.

The machine weighs only 280 pounds and depending on what type of battery it uses it can move someone anywhere from 28 to 130 miles. The battery takes between 15 minutes to eight hours to charge.

Martel is now looking for distributors and manufacturers. Take a look at the demonstrative video.
