The Queen appeared to have made a remarkable recovery yesterday from the heavy cold which caused her to miss church on Sunday for the first time in living memory.

She looked radiant in a bright turquoise Peter Enrione dress and matching wool coat with a hat by Rachel Trevor-Morgan.

Wellwishers were delighted as the 86-year-old Queen collected posies and gifts of teddy bears outside St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham.

At the end of a momentous year for the Royal Family, observers said they had never seen the Queen looking happier.

The media were requested to ‘respect the privacy’ of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge despite their decision to attend church with family and friends in Berkshire yesterday.

All national media acceded to the request.But a small number of freelance photographers turned up, including representatives of the Reuters international news agency.

The couple’s Scotland Yard police protection officers made no attempt  to stop them taking pictures, as they often do, and even moved their vehicles to provide a clear view of  William and Kate.

The photographs subsequently went round the world but St James’s Palace requested British newspapers not to publish them.

The only disappointment for the crowds
 was the absence of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who opted to 
spend Christmas Day with Kate’s parents at their new mansion in 
Bucklebury, Berkshire, as well as Prince Harry who is serving on the 
front line in Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot.

Instead of meeting and greeting many 
of the estimated 3,000 members of the public who go to Sandringham in 
Norfolk each year, William and Kate joined her parents, Michael and 
Carole Middleton, sister Pippa and brother James for family Eucharist 
and Christmas carols at St Mark’s Church in Englefield.

The couple made 
the unusual decision to skip the Royal Family’s traditional celebrations
 with the duchess still in the early stages of a difficult pregnancy.

Earlier this month she was hospitalised for three nights with acute 
nausea, sickness and dehydration.

Doctors have warned that the 
condition, hyperemesis gravidarum, can recur at any time and the duchess
 has suffered at least one relapse since.

According to onlookers, Kate looked 
peaky with heavy shadows under her eyes – a sign that the condition, 
which her husband referred to ruefully as ‘day and all night sickness’ 
might have returned again.

But at least Christmas with the 
Middletons is a far more relaxed event than the formal affair at 
Sandringham, where guests are required to change outfits several times a
 day.

Pippa Middleton recently wrote of her 
‘blissfully calm’ family celebrations involving nothing more strenuous 
than a few parlour games. She also revealed that her father likes to 
surprise his family with a different fancy dress each year – once 
sporting an inflatable sumo wrestler’s outfit.

Royal sources were at pains to point 
out that William and Kate’s decision to remain in Bucklebury was taken 
with the approval of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, and that the 
young couple planned to visit Sandringham at some point in the Christmas
 period.

Following Philip’s own absence last 
year after being rushed to hospital for heart surgery, the duke made a 
point of leading his family as they walked from Sandringham House to the
 nearby parish church while the Queen, as usual, was driven.

He was accompanied by Prince Charles 
and the Duchess of Cornwall, Princess Anne and Vice Admiral Timothy 
Laurence and Prince Edward with his wife, Sophie, the Countess of 
Wessex, and their eldest daughter, Lady Louise.

Both Princess Anne’s children were 
present this year with their respective spouses – Olympian Zara Phillips
 and husband Mike Tindall and Peter and Autumn Phillips.

Prince Andrew 
was accompanied by his daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, who 
wore some of the most eye-catching outfits of the day.

Zara wore a hat by Karen Henriksen, 
the Countess of Wessex chose one by Jane Taylor, Autumn Phillips opted 
for a Nerida Fraiman design while Princess Beatrice wore a creation by 
the young British milliner Rosie Olivia.

Christmas lunch

Phoenix Stanford, eight, and 
sister Evangeline, five, from RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk, wore Santa hats 
as they met the Queen. Phoenix said: ‘The Queen said they were lovely 
flowers.’

The Queen was also handed a bag of dog treats for her corgis by a girl in the crowd.

At Sandringham, the Royal Family enjoy
 a Christmas lunch of Norfolk turkey before settling down in front of 
the television to watch the Queen’s Speech.

Asked whether William and Kate would have done the same with the Middletons in Berkshire, a source said: ‘Absolutely.’
