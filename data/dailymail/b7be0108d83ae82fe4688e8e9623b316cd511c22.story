Francois Hollande today spoke for the first time about the health of his grief-stricken ex-partner, after confirming that he 'doesn't want' another first lady in the Elysée palace.

The French president has also been encouraged by his advisers to begin a 'bachelor presidency' as Valerie Trierweiler, 48, ends her eight-day stay in hospital prompted by claims of an affair between Mr Hollande and film actress Julie Gayet, 41.

His new commitment to the single life, reported in the French press, came as he made a solo official visit to the Dutch royal family.

Mr Hollande said Ms Trierweiler was 
having a rest but otherwise ‘doing better, while making plans to kick her 
out of the Elysée Palace for good.

According to sources close to the president, who spoke to news magazine L'Express, he has been advised to usher in 'a bachelor presidency', which would be 'an element of modernisation for the role of president'.

Meanwhile French TV station Itélé reported that Mr Hollande told a group of journalists: 'I do not want there to be first lady in the future at the Elysée.'

During his visit to the Netherlands, Mr Hollande pointedly referred to the first lady by her full name.

Asked
 directly at a press conference if Ms Trierweiler was still his first 
lady, Mr Hollande said: ‘Thank you for your question. Valerie 
Trierweiler is doing better and is now resting at La Lanterne. I have 
nothing to add.’

La 
Lanterne is the massively luxurious presidential retreat in 
Versailles, where Ms Trierweiler arrived in a police-escorted limousine.

According to Paris Match – where Ms Trierweiler still works as a columnist – she is a broken woman.

Mr
 Hollande only visited her for half-an-hour when she was in hospital, 
and, according to the glossy magazine she is ‘devastated and humiliated’
 and ‘perhaps at the end of a journey.’

Sources at Paris Match – where 
Trierweiler has worked for more than two decades –  said during a half-hour visit to her
 bedside on Thursday night Hollande 
told his partner that he 'needed time' to decide between her and his alleged lover Julie
 Gayet, 41.

However one 
of Mr Hollande’s aides confirmed yesterday that his relationship with 
48-year-old Miss Trierweiler was ‘over’.

Mr
 Hollande is expected to publicise a decision about Miss Trierweiler’s 
future before he leaves for a scheduled visit to the USA in February.

‘dislikes the rich’, was set to visit his estranged first lady Valerie 
Trierweiler to ‘discuss their future’ in one of the most opulent homes 
in Europe

Meanwhile
 Miss Trierweiler made her first direct public comment about the scandal
 on Saturday, tweeting: ‘Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all 
those who have sent messages of support wishing me a speedy recovery. 
Very touched.’

While 
Miss Trierweiler has indicated she is prepared to forgive and forget 
following revelations of his affair with an actress, her furious uncle 
Florent Massonneau said: ‘I think the fact my niece is being cuckolded 
is disgraceful. Her situation gives us a lot of pain.’

It came as a new poll revealed that 77 per cent of  French people are ‘dissatisfied’ with Hollande’s presidency. 

Today such figures were expected to rise, as the growing crisis was set to be played out in La Lanterne.

Built for the bodyguard of the pre-Revolutionary monarch Louis XVI, it has long been viewed by the left as a symbol of unacceptable wealth and privilege.

Despite having her own flat in Paris, Ms Trierweiler, 48, was driven to the the magnificent presidential home on Saturday afternoon after spending eight days in a private hospital room suffering from stress. 

It was caused by hearing claims about Mr Hollande’s secret two year affair with the film and TV actress Julie Gayet, 41.

As Ms Gayet remained in hiding, a  source close to the president confirmed that he ‘planned to see’

Ms Trierweiler today, and that he and the first lady would be ‘discussing their future’. 

Mr Hollande only saw Ms Trierweiler once in hospital, and even then only after she had been at the Pitie-Salpetriere for more than a week.

Ms Trierweiler is desperately trying to hang on to her role, despite clear indications that Mr Hollande wants to make Ms Gayet his first lady.

In an attempt to drum up public support, Ms Trierweiler took to Twitter on Saturday night to write: ‘Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all those who sent messages of support ... very touched’.

Her words were met with an avalanche of ridicule, with people describing her as everything from ‘the Rottweiler’ to the new Marie-Antoinette, after the high-living wife of Louis XVI who was eventually guillotined.

A new Ifop/idd poll in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper reveals 37 per cent of France is ‘very discontented’ with Hollande’s presidency, and 40 per cent are simply ‘discontented’.

Mr Hollande visited his political heartland of Correze, in central France, on Saturday, but again refused to answer questions about who his real first lady was.

Instead Bernard Combes, the Socialist mayor of Combes – a job Mr Hollande had for seven years – said: ‘France's political situation requires all of the president's attention and all of his time, so obviously it would be best for everyone if he can resolve the problems in his personal life under good conditions.’
