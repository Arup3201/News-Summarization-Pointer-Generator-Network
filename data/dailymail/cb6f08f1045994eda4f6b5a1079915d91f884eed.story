Convicted murderer Robert J. Turner who died of flesh-eating bacteria

A convicted murderer serving 40 years for the killing of a teenager has died after contracting a flesh-eating skin infection.

Robert J. Turner, 32, was pronounced dead on Friday after he became infected with the bacterial infection formally known as necrotizing fasciitis.

The results of an autopsy carried out over the weekend also showed that Turner had developed sepsis - a blood poisoning condition - his death was ruled 
to be natural by the medical examiner's office

Turner, who was jailed in 1998, died in Chicagoâ€™s intensive care unit at the University of Illinois Medical Center
after being transferred there last 
Wednesday, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.

Turner,
who has been based at the Dixon Correctional Center, was 
also being treated for a number of other health conditions, including cirrhosis of 
the liver, authorities said.

According to the Chicago Tribune Turner was 18 when he and two other men were charged with the shooting of Derek Miles, also 18.

Chicago police said Turner and his two accomplices confronted Mr
Miles and two companions on the street and demanded money.

The victims could only muster $15 between them, but one of the three offered 
to hand over valuables stored in Mr Miles' home.

As the three burglars were stealing stereo equipment and
other items from the property, Mr Miles slipped away to retrieve a gun from another part of 
the house.

When Mr Miles returned and confronted the three men, police said, someone fired several shots, killing him.

The nasty bacteria, more commonly called 'flesh-eating disease', rapidly causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat

Turner's death from necrotizing fasciitis is the latest in a string of rare flesh-eating bacteria cases reported in the U.S. this year.

Last month Anthony Hills, 55, from Charleston, died from the aggressive infection and in July seven-year-old Tevita Alatini from Texas was also killed from the condition.

Linda Snyder, a pastor from Sacramento, California, lost her life in June after being infected as did Michigan woman Crystal Spencer, 33.

The bug enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape

The
nasty bacteria, more commonly called 'flesh-eating disease', rapidly 
causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles 
and fat.

The
bug enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape and as the 
bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off 
blood flow to the area.

Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body.

Symptoms
include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading 
bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock 
are also common complications.

Sufferers
must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given 
powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can 
become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg.

Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.

In May, new mother, Lana Kuykendall, 
contracted necrotizing fasciitis in a hospital in upstate South 
Carolina, just after delivering her twin babies.

She underwent 20 surgical procedures to stop the aggressive bacteria spreading but managed to avoid having any limbs amputated.

Earlier in the year the 
same disease savagely struck Georgia student Aimee Copeland forcing 
surgeons to amputate all four of her limbs to save her life.

In total at
least five Americans have now died from the infection and another eight victims have had 
limbs amputated.
