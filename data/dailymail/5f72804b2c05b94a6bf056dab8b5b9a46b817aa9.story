Animal lovers have defended two dogs that will be put down today following an attack that left a 10-year-old boy in a serious condition in Wollongong.

The young boy entered a gated front yard on Waley Ave in Bellambi while looking for his brother and was bitten and wounded on his legs, arms, hips, stomach, buttocks and head by an American Staffordshire terrier and German shepherd at about 2pm yesterday.

A spokesman for Wollongong Council told Daily Mail Australia the dogs were seized yesterday following the attack and will be put down today.

'The owners surrendered the animals,' he said.

Dog lovers have leapt to the defence of the animals and their owners on social media, saying that the house had a ‘Beware of the dog. Enter at your own risk’ sign on the front fence.

'I'm sick of innocent dogs getting put down because of the negligence of others. Who's property did he go on?????????' Ryan Micallef posted on the NSW Police Force Facebook page.

'It's a horrible incident but all children should be taught never to enter someone's yard with out permission specially if there is a gate n it's shut. Dogs r protective they were doing there job! I'm so sorry for this boy n his injuries poor little man may all of us with small children take from this to educate them on dangers entering yards both from animals n strangers,' Sam Gafa wrote.

Meanwhile Sherri Meredith wrote: 'Kid shouldn't have walked into the back yard. Might teach him to knock on a door and ask next time instead of just walking onto someone's property! I feel sorry for the dogs.'

The boy was taken to Wollongong Hospital after paramedics were called and he was later airlifted to  Sydney Children's Hospital at Randwick, where he underwent surgery.

As of 1.30am Wednesday morning, the young boy's condition was not known a police media spokesperson said.

A spokeswoman for the Sydney Children's Hospital said the boy's mother was 'very distressed' and did not wish to release any information about her son's condition.

Police were told the boy was looking for his brother with a friend and the two had been door knocking before the boy entered the yard.

His friend was not involved in the dog attack and remained on the footpath while it happened, reported The Daily Telegraph.

A police media spokesperson confirmed that Wollongong Council  had been notified of the dog attack and was investigation.

Police are also currently investigating the attack.

This incident was the latest in a spate of reported dog attacks on young children in the Bellambi area on Tuesday.

NSW Ambulance Illawarra district inspector Terry Morrow confirmed paramedics received two unrelated dog attack reports in the area, neither matching the incident reported by police, reported the Illawarra Mercury.

Also at Waley Avenue, paramedics attended an 11-year-old who had be bitten by a small dog, and the child was taken to Wollongong Hospital with minimal bleeding and a few small puncture wounds, Mr Morrow said.

After a dog bit a 10-year-old on the buttocks, the child went to Wollongong following the attack in Bellambi’s Whitby Mews, also on Tuesday.

For treatment of a small wound, the child was transferred to Sydney Children’s Hospital by road ambulance.
