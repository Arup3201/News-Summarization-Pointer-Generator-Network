Neymar was spotted recovering from his injury on holiday with friends in Ibiza, but the Brazilian forward still has to wear a corset-like back protector.

The 22-year-old injured his back during Brazil's World Cup match against Colombia and has been forced to wear the protector ever since, even when taking a dip in the sea.

Barcelona's forward is recovering from his injury, and his World Cup exploits in Ibiza - the star and his friends were enjoying the sun while on a boat, just off the coast of the Spanish island.

Signing: When Neymar does return from injury, he will likely still have to wait before linking up with Luis Suarez

Neymar's team-mates, meanwhile are preparing for their pre-season friendly against Napoli on Wednesday.

Luis Enrique's men drew 1-1 with Nice on Saturday, a penalty from Xavi mid-way through the second half salvaged a draw for a disappointing Barcelona side that was without Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar.

The Catalan club had previously been training at St George's Park in Staffordshire. Barcelona will kick off their season at home to Elche on August 24. 

Friends: The 22-year-old was on the boat in Ibiza with a large group of friends

Return: With Luis Suarez banned and Messi recovering from the World Cup, fans will hope to see Neymar soon

No rest: He may be injured but has done a lot of travelling this summer, from Asia to the US and back to Europe

VIDEO I will return 100 percent fit - Neymar
