The Foreign Secretary William Hague will propose a new 'red card' system to allow EU countries to block unwelcome laws

The Tories are to demand a new ‘red card’ system so that national parliaments can block unwelcome EU laws.

As part of David Cameron’s bid to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with Brussels, Foreign Secretary William Hague will today reveal the first concrete demand for reform of the European Union ahead of an in-out referendum in 2017.

In a hard-hitting speech, Mr Hague will call for national parliaments, such as the House of Commons, to be able to overrule legislation proposed by the European Commission if enough legislatures call for it to be thrown out.

Mr Hague will say that the European Parliament has ‘failed’ to introduce democratic accountability to the EU.

And he will argue that the time has come to return powers to elected politicians in nation states who are far more accountable to their voters than MEPs.

Little known and little used powers exist that allow parliaments in member states to issue a ‘yellow card’ to the European Commission, which proposes all EU legislation.

But that device only forces the unelected Commission to think again about laws, it cannot block them altogether.

In a speech to a think tank in Germany, Mr Hague will spell out plans to give national MPs the right to issue a ‘red card’ instead and throw out the plans altogether.

The Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Brussels

The speech, to the Konigswinter Conference, is the first time a senior Tory has spelt out any of the demands that Mr Cameron will make when he comes to re-negotiate Britain’s relationship with Brussels.

The Foreign Office is also running a ‘Balance of Competencies Review’ of where power lies between Brussels and member states but it is not expected to draw up a shopping list of powers that the UK wants repatriated before the general election in 2015.

Mr Hague believes that he will win support for the ‘red card’ plan from other Northern European countries, including Germany.
