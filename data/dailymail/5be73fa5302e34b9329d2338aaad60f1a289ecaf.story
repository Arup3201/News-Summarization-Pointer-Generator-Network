In a moving tribute to celebrate the life of Peter O’Toole, his daughters Kate and Patricia waltzed down the aisle at his funeral.

But seven months after mourners gathered to say farewell to the veteran actor, it can be revealed that he treated his girls very differently in his will.

O’Toole, who died aged 81 last December, did not leave a penny to Patricia, 50, after being estranged from her for years.

Mysterious: Peter O'Toole had been estranged from his daughter Patricia (pictured together) for years

Meanwhile, the biggest share of his £4  million estate in England and Wales went to her sister  Kate, 53.

The bulk of the rest of it was shared by O’Toole’s son  Lorcan, 31, and the actor’s  teenage granddaughter, Jessica – Patricia’s daughter.

The sisters were from O’Toole’s marriage to Welsh actress Sian Phillips. Lorcan was the product of the actor’s relationship with American model Karen Somerville.

Irish-born O’Toole – best known for his starring role in Sir David Lean’s 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia – stated in his will that he was making ‘no provision’ for Patricia after being estranged from her ‘for some years’.

Their estrangement at the time he wrote his will in January last year has never previously been revealed and the reasons for it are not known.

It is not known if the pair were reconciled in the months before his death when he was battling a long illness.

Patricia, a business education and arts training consultant, gave no hint of their difficult relationship when she joined her mother and sister at his funeral in Golders Green crematorium in North London in December.

She and her sister waltzed down the aisle to the delight of other mourners: O’Toole had done the same at the funeral of his mother Constance.

Patricia, who lives with her partner and daughter in Lewes, East Sussex, and still uses her father’s surname, refused to discuss the will or the reasons for their estrangement.

Biggest share: His elder daughter Kate, 53, took the bulk of the estate with a £1.1million share

She said yesterday: ‘I appreciate it is interesting to the public, but it is a personal and family matter. I do not wish to make any comment.’

The disclosure in the will of the estrangement also surprised friends of O’Toole’s family.

One told The Mail on Sunday yesterday: ‘I never realised there was any problem between them.’

Details of the will were revealed last week in probate records. The actor left a net estate of £4,042,516, in England and Wales.

O’Toole left a series of legacies to family and friends including £200,000 to his ‘beloved’ personal assistant, Lucy Villiers.

He left a total of around £760,000 to Lorcan, an actor, made up of a £400,000 legacy and 20 per cent of the residue of his estate in England and Wales after settlement of his other legacies and inheritance tax.

Daughter Kate, also an actor, received around £1.1 million made up of 60 per cent of the residuary.

She also received all of his property and assets in the Republic of Ireland.

The remaining 20 per cent – believed to be around £360,000 – was left for 14-year-old Jessica to claim when she is 18. She also received his Mini Cooper car.

O’Toole, who lived in Cricklewood, North London, pointed out in his will that he had ‘many years ago’ given Patricia a 25 per cent share in his  company Keep Films Ltd.

He stated that she would receive ‘substantial financial benefit’ from the company after his death, though records show that the 25 per cent shareholding is owned jointly by Patricia and Kate.

Latest accounts for the company show it was worth £609,800 last year.

O’Toole left all his artwork, books, a ring and his luxury Audemars Piguet watch to Kate. His sister Patricia Coombs received all his theatre posters, photographs and ‘theatre knick-knacks’.

Another legacy left all his clothing to the Rugby Football Union’s Injured Players Fund.

His remaining chattels were shared by Kate and Lorcan.

O’Toole requested that some of his ashes be interred at the actor’s church of St Paul’s in Covent  Garden, London, with an inscription giving his name and the words ‘Goodnight and joy be with you all’.

He asked for the rest of his ashes to be interred on his land at Eyrephort near Clifden, County Galway in the Republic of Ireland.

O’Toole, the son of an Irish bookmaker, grew up in northern England and worked as a trainee journalist before completing his National Service as a signaller in the Royal Navy.

He then attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, alongside Albert Finney and Alan Bates, and started his career on the stage where he won critical acclaim for a 1955 role as Hamlet at the Bristol Old Vic theatre.

O’Toole had hardly any film experience when in 1962 he got the break of a lifetime in Lawrence of Arabia, playing T.  E. Lawrence, the British army officer who led the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Turkish empire during the First World War. The role had been turned down by Marlon Brando and Finney.

The four-hour epic, which took two years to make and also starred Omar Sharif, turned him into a household name – and he bought a white Rolls-Royce with his wages.

The epic earned him the first of eight Best Actor Oscar nominations – though he never won. He received an honorary Oscar in 2003, having initially turned it down.

In a letter, O’Toole asked the  Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to delay the award  until he was 80, saying he was ‘still in the game and might win the  bugger outright’.

But when he finally clasped his statuette, he said: ‘Always a bridesmaid, never a bride, my foot.’

He was nominated again in  2006 for his role as a lecherous old actor in the British comedy drama Venus, which also starred Leslie Phillips.

O’Toole had a reputation for riotous behaviour and brawling following bouts of drinking during his younger days.

But he was forced to give up alcohol after he had most of his stomach and his pancreas removed in 1976.

The surgery left him as an insulin-dependent diabetic, and he then nearly died from a blood disorder in 1978. His 20-year marriage to Ms Phillips, which ended in divorce in 1979, was once one of the most famous couplings in the theatrical world, rivalled only by that of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.

Ms Phillips revealed in two biographies that he had subjected her to mental cruelty, largely fuelled by heavy drinking, and was subject to bouts of extreme jealousy after she left him for a younger lover.

O’Toole finally announced his retirement from acting after a  50-year career in July 2012, announcing that it was time ‘to chuck in  the sponge’.

Prime Minister David Cameron paid tribute to him after his death, praising his ‘stunning’ performance in Lawrence of Arabia which he described as his ‘favourite film’.
