Ed Miller Band: The Labour leader, not to be confused with the Steve Miller Band

They have mistaken toddlers for Ayatollahs, called for violence at funerals, and let loose zebras onto the football pitch.

No wonder the broadcasting regulator Ofcom has criticised TV companies for their frequent bloopers in subtitles.

‘It is clear from viewers’ feedback that they sometimes find live subtitling frustrating, and, on occasion, unwatchable,’ the watchdog has said.

Mistakes happen during live TV, such as the news and sports events, because a Heath Robinson system called ‘re-speaking’ is used to create subtitles as the programme is being broadcast.

A specialist sits in a soundproof booth and repeats every word, slowly and clearly, into a microphone. Quickly processed by voice-recognition software, the words are then displayed on screen, within a second or two.

Sometimes, however, the computer software doesn’t get things quite right . . .

‘Medical staff have been urged to step up high jean levels.’

The reporter on BBC Breakfast was referring to ‘hygiene levels’.

‘More controlled burning of witches will save bush fires in future.’

The news reporter didn’t say witch, but ‘which’.

‘Welcome to the year of the whores. People around the world celebrate.’

The BBC News Channel ushered in the Chinese New Year — the year of the ‘horse’.

‘Girls, don’t give up on that sex-offender.’

In fact, the Olympic rowing commentator had urged: ‘Girls, don’t give up, don’t surrender.’

‘Hernandez, Van Persie, Rooney, Juan Mata, Janet jazz jazz jam.’

Presenter Mark Chapman listed the Manchester United squad on Match Of The Day 2. Hernandez, Van Persie, Rooney, Juan Mata are all genuine players. But their Belgian-born team-mate Adnan Januzaj came out wrong.

‘A foul by a zebra.’

More from Match Of The Day. It wasn’t a ‘zebra’ on the pitch but the then Manchester United player, (Patrice) Evra.

‘Andy Murray has become Midge Ure’

This Wimbledon commentary subtitle should have stated Andy had become ‘mature’.

Prince William and his wife, the 'badgers of Cambridge' - better known as the 'Duchess of Cambridge' 

‘Both teams mock the fact that tomorrow is Remembrance Sunday.’

Match Of The Day again! In truth, the teams were ‘marking’ the event by standing in silence.

‘They’re all here because of my cologne.’

The BBC sports reporter was referring to one of England’s top footballers: ‘They’re all here because of Michael Owen.’

‘They love to nibble anything that comes into the shed, like our willies.’

‘We will now have a moment’s violence.’

The BBC’s subtitler hit the wrong note before a brief silence at the Queen Mother’s funeral.

‘Today is the spring equilibrium within ox’

The spring equinox.

‘[Ministers] are making holes for surgeons.’

The BBC subtitle should have read: ‘making helpful decisions.’

Nothing to do with Iranian religious leaders. It should have been ‘be given to our toddlers’.

‘Boris Johnson is back for a second term as London Mayor’.

A prince of weapons? Bionicle — the popular fantasy Lego toys? The subtitle was supposed to be: ‘Looking for principally chemical and biological weapons.’
