Arming Syria's rebels will put guns in the hands of extremists who 'eat the organs' of their enemies, Vladimir Putin warned David Cameron last night.

The Prime Minister hoped to get Mr Putin to soften his stance against Western intervention. But in an extraordinary joint press conference in Downing Street, the Russian president accused the Prime Minister and Barack Obama of trying to arm terrorists.

And in a blood-curdling reference to video footage of a rebel fighter apparently eating the liver of a dead Syrian soldier, he even suggested the Prime Minister was siding with cannibals.

Warning: Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron (right) leads Russia's President Vladimir Putin into 10 Downing Street

Mr Cameron was holding talks with  Putin on Syria's civil war, a meeting which could set the tone for the G8 summit, with the West at odds with Moscow over how to handle the conflict

Reacting to comments from Mr Cameron 
that those arming the Damascus regime had the 'blood of the children of 
Syria' on their hands, a furious Mr Putin said: 'The blood is on the 
hands of both parties.

'There is always a question as to who is to blame. One should hardly back those who kill enemies and eat their organs.

'It is hardly in relation to the 
humanitarian and cultural values Europe has been professing for 
centuries.' Mr Putin dismissed calls from Mr Cameron and the West to 
stop arming the regime of dictator Bashar al-Assad, saying Russia was 
supplying 'the legitimate government of Syria in full compliance with 
the norms of international law'.

The two leaders did manage to find 
common ground, paying tribute to the heroism of the British crews of the
 wartime Arctic Convoys – as the Russian president awarded them with a 
special gallantry medal.

But a senior Russian source said the 
talks had gone badly. 'We have lots of very serious disagreements on 
Syria,' they said – adding that America's announcement last week that it
 would now arm Syria's rebels had made it much harder to reach a deal.

The excruciating press conference came
 as the policy of arming the rebels came under fire from Boris Johnson, 
Nick Clegg, MPs and military figures.

In a partial echo of Mr Putin, the  
London mayor warned that any weapons sent to the country's opposition 
could end up in the hands of 'Al Qaeda-affiliated thugs'.

He added: 'This is not the moment to 
send more arms. We can't use Syria as an arena for geopolitical 
point-scoring or muscle-flexing, and we won't get a ceasefire by 
pressing weapons into the hands of maniacs.'

Mr Cameron has been told by 
Conservative whips that, with Labour and the Liberal Democrats likely to
 join as many as two-thirds of Tory MPs in opposing arming the Syrian 
opposition, a Commons vote would almost certainly be lost.

Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg has 
insisted the idea of a unilateral British intervention is 'fanciful' and
 Tory MP Julian Lewis said arming the Syrian rebels would be 'suicidal' 
for Britain.

Half of the ministers in the Cabinet 
are also against ratcheting up Britain's involvement, while the top 
brass have expressed grave concern at the prospect of fresh demands on 
the Armed Forces at a time of a funding squeeze.

General Lord Dannatt, the former head 
of the Army, said ministers must not forget the lessons of Iraq and 
Afghanistan when the UK became bogged down in bloody conflicts.

He warned: 'If we have learned 
anything from the last few years it is that we don't get involved in 
another intervention without having a very clear idea of what we're 
going to do, who we're going to help, what the plan is and what the exit
 strategy is. Surely we've not forgotten the lessons of Iraq and 
Afghanistan so quickly.'

'The blood is on the hands of both parties.There is always a question as to who is to blame for that.'

Vladimir Putin

There were signs yesterday that Mr 
Cameron is backing away from the prospect of directly arming the  
rebels. The Prime Minister suggested the 'greatest assistance' the UK 
can give is in technical support and training.

With the issue set to dominate the G8 
summit opening today in Northern Ireland, he signalled that the prospect
 of him pushing for the UK to arm rebels is receding now that the US has
 suggested it will step in. He went on: 'I think where we can actually 
give the greatest assistance to the official proper Syrian opposition, 
is advice, is training and is technicalsupport. That is where we can 
play the greatest role.'

However, Mr Cameron made an 
impassioned case for the West coming to Syria's aid. 'President Assad is
 now guilty of the most appalling crimes against his people – 90,000 
dead and some of them through the use of appalling chemical weapons,' 
the   said.

'What we all want is an international 
peace conference and an international agreement for a transitional 
government in Syria, that the Syrian people can have confidence in, and 
then elections and a new Syrian government. That's what everybody wants.

'The disagreement is obviously how we get there.'

Sources insisted Mr Cameron still has 
hopes of hammering  out a framework for a peace deal in the coming days,
 and co-operate with Russia to ease Syria's dire humanitarian situation.
