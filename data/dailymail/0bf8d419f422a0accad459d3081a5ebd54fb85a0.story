West Ham manager Sam Allardyce told co-owners David Gold and David Sullivan he has nothing to prove ahead of the visit of Sunderland.

Allardyce’s future remains uncertain as he goes into Saturday’s match having not won in the Barclays Premier League since January 18 against Hull City.

The 60-year-old’s contract expires at the end of the season and Allardyce is prepared to fight for his job as he declared anything less than 10th is unacceptable.

‘Win all nine, I’m doing great. Lose all nine, get rid of him,’ he said. ‘That’s a bit of tongue in cheek, but it’s true. Everybody would go away and say what a bad season it’s been. If we turn it around, what a great season.

‘I don’t have to defend myself to the owners. We all know in terms of where we are. I’m disappointed. The players are disappointed.

‘David Sullivan and David Gold are very disappointed in the run we’ve had up to now. At the end of the day we’re still 10th. We’ve still got 39 points. We’ve still got nine games to go.

‘Anything less than 10th is going to end up being hugely disappointing, and around eighth is massive progress for us. Anything more than that would be a massive over-achievement for this squad.’

Allardyce confirmed he will be without James Tomkins for the remainder of the season after the defender needed surgery on a dislocated shoulder suffered in training.
