Former French first lady Valerie Trierweiler faced further humiliation today after being referred to as ‘Rottweiler’ on a live news broadcast.

The hugely embarrassing blunder took place during a flagship current affairs programme in Gabon, a former French colony on the west coast of Africa.

A clip of the show is now spreading online in France, showing a female journalist announcing ‘more sad news’ towards the ends of a news show.

She then describes how President Francois Hollande has ended his ‘shared life’ with ‘the journalist Valerie Rottweiler’.

Ms Trierweiler was first nicknamed ‘The Rottweiler’, after the potentially hugely aggressive dog, in April 2012.

This was the month before Ms Trierweiler’s then boyfriend was elected, when she said: ‘I have character, they can’t muzzle me’.

Ms Trierweiler has displayed her own fiery temper on numerous occasions, not least of all when she learned of Mr Hollande’s affair with the actress Julie Gayet almost three weeks ago.

She is said to have gone on the rampage, smashing up antique furniture before checking herself into a hospital for eight days, suffering from stress.

The relationship officially ended last Sunday, but Ms Trierweiler has been allowed to complete one last charity trip to India with presidential staff including a bodyguard.

She is now expected to stay away from the Elysee Palace, and will be living alone in the flat she once shared with Mr Hollande in Paris’s 15th arrondissement.

Gabon gained independence from France in 1960, but retains extremely close ties with its former coloniser.
