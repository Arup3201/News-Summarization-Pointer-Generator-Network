An 11-year-old boy has gone where many of the best economic minds in Europe have feared to tread and proposed a radical solution to the euro's problems - using a pizza as his inspiration.

Jurre Hermans' entry in the £250,000 Wolfson Economics Prize - an international competition to find the 'best contingency plan for a break-up of the euro' - won special mention from judges.

Hermans, of Breedenbroek in the Netherlands, was 10 at the time he entered.

Sorting them all out: Jurre Hermans, 11, (right) pictured here with father Julius (left) has proposed a radical solution to the euro's problems - using a pizza as his inspiration

The plan: Jurre Hermans' entry to the £250,000 Wolfson Economics Prize - an international competition to find the 'best contingency plan for a break-up of the euro' - is pictured here

He has been given a €100 gift voucher for his efforts but unfortunately failed to make the final short list of five.

Hermans' suggestion was that Greeks be given drachmas in exchange for their euros and that anyone moving euros out of Greece should be penalised.

He wrote: 'All Greek people should bring their euro to the bank. They put it in an exchange machine .... You see, the Greek guy does not look happy!

'The Greek man gets back Greek drachme from the bank, their old currency. The bank gives all these euros to the Greek government.

'All these euros together form a pancake or a pizza. Now the Greek government can start to pay back all their debts, everyone who has a debt gets a slice of the pizza.

'You see that all these euros in the pizzas go the companies and banks who have given loans in Greece.'

Protege: Jurre Hermans was 10 at the time he entered the competition

His father Julius told CNN he was proud his son thought about the world's problems and came up with solutions.

But he revealed Jurre did not want to become an economist when he was older, and would rather pursue his love of animals in becoming a zoo director.

Dear Sir and Madam,

My name is Jurre Hermans. I am 10 years old and live in the Netherlands. I am quite worried about the eurocrisis and look at the TV news daily. The eurocrisis is a big problem.

I think about solutions. Since I read in the newspaper about your price, I thought that I would like to submit my idea. The idea might fit. So here it is:

I made a picture of my solution and I will explain it to you.

Greece should leave the Euro. How do you do that?

All Greek people should bring their Euro to the bank. They put it in an exchange machine (see left on my picture). You see, the Greek guy does not look happy!! The Greek man gets back Greek Drachme from the bank, their old currency.

The Bank gives all these euro's to the Greek Government (see topleft on my picture). All these euros together form a pancake or a pizza(see on top in the picture).

Now the Greek government can start to pay back all their debts, everyone who has a debt gets a slice of the pizza.

You see that all these euro's in the pizza's go the companies and banks who have given loans in greece(see right in my picture)

Now here comes the clever part of my idea:

The Greek people do not want to exchange their Euro's for Drachmes because they know that this Drachme will lose its value dramatically. They try to keep or hide their Euro's. They know that if they wait a while they will get more Drachmes.

So if a Greek man tries to keep his Euros(or bring his euros to a bank in an other country like Holland orn Germany) and it is discovered, he gets a penalty just as high or double as the whole amount in euros he tried to hide!!!

In this way I ensure that all Greeks bring their euros to a greek bank and so the greek government can pay back all the debts.

I hope my idea helps you!!!!

Of course if a country has paid back all his debts , he can return to the eurozone.

A bit more about myself: I am 10, love animals since I have a dog and a bird. I live in a family of 5 in Holland. I have 5 friends with whom I play all day, mostly outside.

PS: My father helped me with my English translation as I speak Dutch

greetings from Holland,

Jurre Hermans

He also said his son wanted the euro to continue, and that he used a pizza to explain his plan because it was one of his favourite foods.

His prize money, he added, will probably be spent on games in a toy shop.

The competition comes as the 17-country single currency union continues to be placed under considerable strain by the crippling debt problems of some of its members.

Some Europe-watchers have warned that any country's exit from the eurozone would destabilise the rest of Europe and plunge the region into a deep recession.

On the other side, 'euroskeptics' argue that the currency union's problems are so great that an orderly break-up with countries going back to their old currencies, such as the Greek drachma and Italian lira, is the best answer.

The prize, was has attracted 425 entries, has been sponsored by a family charity trust of Conservative peer Lord Simon Wolfson and is being run by the think tank Policy Exchange.

Lord Wolfson said at the announcement of the shortlist: 'Sadly, the risk of a country leaving the eurozone has not gone away.

'The ideas contained in these entries are an invaluable contribution to tackling this important issue.'

The prize's five shortlisted finalists will each receive £10,000 pounds to continue their work ahead of the prize's award on July 5.

Robert Bootle and his team of Capital Economics in London said any country leaving the euro would convert its government and consumer debt into its own currency - such as the Greek drachma.

The country would then deliberately default to bring its debt levels down to 60 percent of its economic output.

British private investor Catherine Dobbs said the process which created the euro should basically be reversed. All claims in the exiting country would be replaced by claims in the new currency.

Jens Nordvig and Nick Firoozy of Nomura Securities in London said that if a country quits the euro, British law would not recognise debt contracts in the country's new currency.

A new way of handling and dealing in these debt contracts would have to be introduced.

Neil Record, of Record Currency Management, said that if one country leaves the euro, the currency has to be dissolved.

He thus argues for maintaining secrecy for as long as possible before announcing a breakup plan, to prevent markets from attacking structural weaknesses in other countries.

And Jonathan Tepper, of North Carolina-based Variant Perception, said that as many currency unions have failed in the past a euro break-up would not be especially challenging.

Using past examples as a guide, countries should exit by surprise over a weekend, declare an extra bank holiday or two around the date of the exit and stamp the existing currency until new notes are circulated.

Today, the sovereign debt crisis continued to hit Europe, with stock markets failing to hold on to early gains as investors fretted about Spain's debt problems.

Problems: Today, the sovereign debt crisis continued to hit Europe, with stock markets failing to hold on to early gains as investors fretted about Spain's debt problems

A disappointing set of Spanish bond auctions yesterday contributed to a big rout on global stock markets.

Spain has become the latest point of concern in Europe's debt crisis as investors are concerned over the ability of the government to push through its big austerity programme at a time when its economy is heading for a return to recession and unemployment is standing at around 23 per cent.

The yield on the country's 10-year bond pushed up a further 0.07 percentage point to 5.73 per cent, a sign that investors are wary of Spain's ability to avoid suffering the same bailout fate as Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

'The eurozone crisis remains unresolved and Spain remains in the spotlight with bond yields moving higher after yesterday's disappointing bond auction,' said Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital.

Investors in Europe also have crucial U.S. jobs data on tomorrow on their minds.

Though much of Europe is off for Good Friday, U.S. markets are open and the centrepiece during the session will be the monthly non-farm payrolls figures for March.

Given that the payrolls data often set the market tone for a week or two after their release, investors are reining in their exposure.

In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was down 0.7 per cent at 5,666 while Germany's DAX fell 1 per cent to 6,713. The CAC-40 in France was 1 per cent lower too at 3,281.

In the current risk-averse trading environment, the euro took a further knock, trading 0.5 per cent lower at $1.3068.

Wall Street was poised for further losses at the open too with both Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures down 0.3 per cent.

Earlier in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.5 per cent to close at 9,767.61 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1 per cent to 20,593.
