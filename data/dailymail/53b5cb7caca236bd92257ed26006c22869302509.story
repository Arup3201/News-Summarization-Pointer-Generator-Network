Vince Cable arriving at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Glasgow for the start of the LIb Dem Party Conference

The Liberal Democrats were plunged into civil war last night as Vince Cable openly defied calls from Nick Clegg to back the Government’s economic policy.

The Business Secretary signalled that he would not back a motion supporting the Coalition’s deficit reduction plans, which will be put forward by the Lib Dem leader today at the party’s conference.

Mr Cable issued a statement last night saying there were ‘aspects’ of the motion he could not support.

This was seen as a clear signal that he wants the Government to increase borrowing.

The move came as deep splits emerged at the top of the Lib Dems over economic policy and over their continuing partnership with the Conservatives.

In a speech today, Mr Cable will demand a lurch to the Left with calls to raise the minimum wage, crack down on zero hours contracts and prevent business bosses who have been banned abroad from taking directorships in the UK.

He will also signal that he opposes Chancellor George Osborne’s Help to Buy scheme.

It is designed to help people move up the housing ladder, but Mr Cable believes it will lead to a new housing bubble.

In a sign of the simmering divisions at the top of the party, Mr Clegg and Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander yesterday slapped down Mr Cable, dismissing his concerns as unwarranted.

The Lib Dem leader said Britain is ‘nowhere near’ a new bubble while Mr Alexander said: ‘We are a million miles away from a housing bubble in this country.’

Mr Clegg will urge his party to stick to the spending plans agreed with the Tories.

But rather than back him up, Mr Cable is due to spend two hours preparing for his own speech to the conference in Glasgow instead of turning up to the vote.

He backs a rebel amendment which calls for borrowing restrictions on councils to be lifted, allowing town hall chiefs to run up deficits to pay for new housing.

Signalling his support for the rebels, his spokesman said that while ‘Vince supports the motion’ she would not confirm that he would turn up and vote.

And in an open challenge to Mr Clegg’s authority, she added: ‘He thinks there are aspects of it that could be improved, drawing on the amendments.’

Mr Clegg said yesterday that he believed it would be deeply damaging to the Lib Dems to sanction increased borrowing, as Labour has been demanding.

And the Deputy Prime Minister warned that the Business Secretary’s desire to distance the party from coalition policy would be an economic and political disaster.

He argued that his party should be claiming credit with the Tories for the economic recovery rather than distancing themselves from it.

The leader’s spokesman said: ‘We need to ensure we get the credit for the hard decisions we have taken.’

Mr Clegg also risked a rift with the Left of his party by hinting that he would prefer a coalition with the Tories after the next election, rather than with Labour, who Mr Cable would prefer to work with. 

Denouncing Labour’s calls for more borrowing, which Mr Cable now appears to back, Mr Clegg said: ‘A majority Labour government would wreck the recovery.’

The Deputy Prime Minister said that by contrast he would go into the election with the message ‘let us finish the job, but finish the job fairly’. 

He said the country needed the Lib Dems in this coalition because the Conservatives ‘don’t have the same commitment to fairness that we do’.

Mr Clegg signalled that his next manifesto will present new tax rises for the wealthy as ‘die in the trench’ policies.

He suggested the party’s Mansion Tax plans, which would raise £2billion a year from those with homes worth more than £2million, would be a red line in negotiations.

And he said the party would also demand that the threshold at which people pay income tax be raised from £10,000 to £12,500, the level of the national minimum wage.

÷Tensions between Mr Cable and Mr Alexander are said to have boiled over at a Cabinet meeting last week when the Business Secretary outlined plans to help small businesses boost growth, the Mail has learned.

When Tories Oliver Letwin and Grant Shapps criticised Mr Cable for piling red tape on firms, Mr Alexander backed them up. 

Yesterday it was reported that Mr Cable and Mr Alexander – the party’s two leading economic ministers – ‘can barely speak to each other’.
