Samantha Cameron today spoke of the difficulties of caring for her late son Ivan during a visit to a children’s hospice.

The six-year-old, who was born seriously disabled, received round-the-clock care for cerebral palsy and epilepsy before his death.

Today, Mrs Cameron shared her experiences with Risa Balynas, whose five-year-old son, Miles, requires similar attention.

Understanding: The PM's wife meets another mother and child as she toured the hospice

The pair met as the Prime Minister’s wife visited Richard House Children’s Hospice in Newham, east London, where they spoke about the challenges of caring for a child with cerebral palsy.

Mrs Balynas, a mother-of two from Tower Hamlets, east London, said: 'It was lovely to meet her. She was saying that Miles’ condition was similar to her son Ivan’s.

'I have a lot of pains and aches from holding him all the time. She said she had that with Ivan when he was younger.

'She told me she had a painful shoulder from holding him because he screamed and went into spasm.

'She understood how it affects you, physically as well as emotionally.'

During her visit, Mrs Cameron was given a tour of the centre, which supports 290 families and 192 children.

She
invited 13-year-old JLS fan Murad Shaikh to visit Downing Street and 
said her daughter Nancy, eight, was equally keen on the band.

She
told Murad: 'My husband and I were lucky as we got to go to the Jubilee
concert and my daughter was very jealous because we got to see JLS.'

Common ground: Mrs Cameron and Mrs Balynas spoke about caring for a child with cerebral palsy

Today marks the start of Carers Week, which aims to raise the awareness of the needs and work of Britain's six million unpaid carers

Ivan Cameron died at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, London, in 2009.

The Camerons also have a son, Arthur, six, and a 22-month-old daughter, Florence.

Mrs Cameron is a patron of The Big Splash charity, which supports disabled children at the school and in the local community.

The Prime Minister's eldest son had a
rare genetic disorder that left him with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. 
He died after a seizure.

After his death in February 2009, Mr 
Cameron said: 'We never expected him to die so young or so suddenly so 
it was a real bolt that hit us.'

Speaking the following month, he said: 'We always knew that Ivan wouldn't live forever because he had this very rare condition and he had been incredibly ill in his short life but we never expected him to die so young or so suddenly.'

At the time, he said he and his wife were hoping they could in time look back and 'remember the good things'.

'I know that will come,' he said. 'It just takes some time. And we just miss him.'
