Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy has likened the vice-president of the National Rifle Association (NRA) to a 'clown' after the body criticised his state's new tighter gun laws.

Governor Malloy said the NRA's executive vice-president, Wayne LaPierre reminded him of the clowns at the circus.' 

'They get the most attention. That's what he's paid to do,' he said. Last week Governor Malloy signed in to law some of the toughest gun control regulations anywhere in the US - in response to the Sandy Hook school shooting.

The nation was left in shock after Adam Lanza shot dead 20 children and six adults at the school in Newtown in December.

The 20-year-old shot his
 mother then went on to spray 155 bullets at innocent children and 
educators during a five-minute, bloody rampage before shooting himself.

The new Connecticut laws include the addition of more than 100 weapons to the state’s list of banned assault weapons.

This includes the semi-automatic Bushmaster rifle, which was one of the guns used by Lanza during the massacre, according to CNN's Political Ticker blog.

Among the other things banned are gun magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.

The new regulations also require gun owners to register pre-existing magazines which are bigger than the new limit - and made it illegal to bring this size of magazine into Connecticut from another state.

Mr LaPierre said the 'criminals' who carry out 'horror and terror' are not going to cooperate with the new laws, and told Fox News that Governor Malloy was only 'making the law books bigger for law abiding people.

Responding, Governor Malloy said Mr LaPierre was 'so out of whack it's unbelievable,' CNN

reports.

Campaign: President Barack Obama will visit Connecticut as part of his efforts to get new gun control legislation through Senate

New York and Colorado have also passed stricter gun legislation following the Sandy Hook massacre.

Governor Malloy said the majority of Americans wanted firmer gun control legislation.

New national gun control legislation is currently sitting before the US Senate. The NRA, however, opposes that bill.

The NRA has proposed the training and arming of adults to protect schools from potential attacks.

Meanwhile,
 President Barack Obama is trying to boost the chances of gun 
legislation being passed by Senate by visiting Connecticut.

Obama
 plans to meet with Sandy Hook families and argue that lawmakers have an
 obligation to the children killed and other victims of gun violence to 
act on his proposals.

Senators
 have yet to reach a deal to pass expanded background checks for gun 
sales. An assault weapons ban does not appear to have enough votes, and 
the prospect for a ban on high-capacity magazines also appears bleak.
