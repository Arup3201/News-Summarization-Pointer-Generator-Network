An artist who has no artistic ability while awake but can create masterpieces in his sleep has turned a gallery in a 'bedroom' for his first solo exhibition.

Lee Hadwin, 39,  replicated the sleeping environment where he produces his paintings and is now displaying them at a gallery in Croydon, south London.

His condition, which has reportedly been medically proven, sees him drawing on walls, tables, clothes and discarded newspapers with various materials - from pens and crayons to paints and coal.

Artist Lee Hadwin, who creates paintings in his sleep, has transformed an art gallery into his sleeping environment for an exhibition of his work

He has attracted worldwide interest in his unusual ability, which manifested at the age of four, when he first started producing 'scribbles'. By the time he was in his mid-teens, the drawings were becoming more detailed. 

Mr Hadwin, who has had no training or inclination in his waking life to be an artist, has sold sleep pieces for six-figure sums in the past with previous buyers including Derren Brown and Donald Trump.

He often wakes up with horrendous migraines after a night's drawing and can be sick as a result, and says it has been a nightmare proving he's not a hoaxer.

Mr Hadwin, originally from Wales but now lives in London with his partner Clint, has been for various tests at the Edinburgh Sleep Clinic with experts going back over his school work to see if he is lying.

His condition began at the age of four when he started scribbling and by his mid-teens the drawing were becoming more and more detailed

He said: 'It can happen two-to-three times a week that I get out of bed and draw in my sleep.

'But then then it might be another two weeks before I do it again. I sometimes go away and come back to finish a piece off.  

'When I wake up, I know I have done something but I don't know what.'

The exhibition, Hypnos, which begins on January 16, takes inspiration from Greek mythology, and its title is based on the namesake and god of sleep, whose son Morpheus was the deity of dreams.

He had no training or inclination in his waking life to be an artist but still wakes in the morning to find he has created masterpieces in the night

Mr Hadwin has just returned back to the UK after a successful tour in China, and will be filmed by ITV for the exhibition as part of a programme looking into sleep, his art and life.

Having previously received heavy criticism, he has now been accepted by the art-world and will be hosting a talk at the gallery next month, in which he will detail his personal story and talk about his unique talent.
