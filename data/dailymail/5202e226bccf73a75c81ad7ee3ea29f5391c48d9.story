Married father:  Peter Raynor, 35, worked at a home  for men with serious mental health problems

A trusted supervisor at a care home stole more than £20,000 from vulnerable residents to bankroll his gambling addiction.

Church-going Peter Raynor, 35, worked at a residential home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, for men with serious mental health problems and had access to their bank accounts.

But the married father helped himself to thousands to fund his online gambling habit.

He managed to keep the scam running for four years by juggling money between the accounts of the victims to cover his tracks, Newcastle Crown Court was told. However, Raynor eventually went to the police to confess.

Now he has been jailed for eight months at the court after admitting six counts of theft.

Recorder Keith Miller told him: ‘The sheer length of time and the fact you were in a position of trust and the amount of money taken means that I can see no good reason to suspend the sentence of imprisonment.

‘It would simply send out the wrong messages about those who commit offences like this in breach of trust. I’m sure your family will support you, as will the rector at the church.’

Raynor was working as a support worker with a supervisory role at the Park House Care Home when he started stealing. The facility, run by Aspire Healthcare, caters for men who are unable to look after their own finances due to their mental health problems.

Prosecutor Mark Giuliani said: ‘The defendant had access to their bank cards, pin numbers and money in the safe which was kept there for each resident.

‘What he did over this period was use that money to fund his gambling habit.’

Raynor was spending thousands on a mobile phone app which encouraged him to buy more items to play the game. Mr Giuliani said: ‘He spent £20,668 which was taken from the residents.’

An internal audit revealed the missing money and Raynor rang his boss and confessed he had stolen it. He then went to a police station and handed himself in, telling officers what he had done.

Mr Giuliani said: ‘He accepted taking all of the cash and said he had stopped counting after about the first £6,000.

‘He said he made sure no resident was left without money and he would juggle money between accounts to make sure no-one was left short.’

Raynor, who lived in a £115,000 semi-detached three-bedroom house in Springwell, near Gateshead, pleaded guilty to six counts of theft. 

The court heard he had never been in trouble before, was a good worker and his offending was not motivated by hostility to the victims.

The judge said Raynor was dedicated to helping the disadvantaged and had walked home from Newcastle on occasions having spent his last money on buying hot drinks for the homeless.

Brian Hegarty, defending, told the court that Raynor has paid back £4,500 and said it was the home who had been left out of pocket rather than the residents.

Mr Hegarty added: ‘He has lived a hitherto blameless life and is of exemplary character. The beginnings of his problems were mental health problems suffered by him in his previous job and it appears he rushed himself back to work too soon.

‘He has stolen money over a number of years for reasons he finds difficult to explain. There was nothing sophisticated about it, he simply took the cash and didn’t make efforts to cover his tracks.

‘He made efforts to repay the money and he gave full assistance to the care home in establishing where and when the thefts occurred.

'There has not been any criticism of his ability to do his job. He says he left the home in a better place than when he started there and he has some pride in that regard. He is a diligent, hard-working family man who has worked hard to support others and his family.’

An Aspire Healthcare spokesman said: ‘The thefts were discovered during a detailed audit by the operator Aspire, who reported Pete to the police.

‘Unfortunately it was undetected for a period of time as Pete was ensuring the balances were correct at the point of audit by moving funds between service users and his own funds.

‘All monies from the residents have been repaid to the five service users by Aspire directly. Aspire will be pursuing Pete in a civil proceedings after the criminal proceedings have been completed

‘Aspire are fully co-operating with the police and the local council safeguarding investigation.’
