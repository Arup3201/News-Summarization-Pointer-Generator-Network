Teaching with a twist: Professor Matthew Weathers who teaches at the Biola University in California

Maths is not usually top of the list when it comes to favourite subjects at school.

But one teacher has found a novel way of getting his pupils attention.

Professor Matthew Weathers starts all his lessons with comical introduction piece – and now his endeavors are causing a stir on YouTube.

In the latest of his videos, the maths genius, who teaches at the Biola University in California, piques the curiosity of students learning about imaginary numbers with an impressive display of computer wizardry.

He creates a double of himself on a computer which appears on a white board behind his desk and then proceeds to chat to his imaginary self.

His class burst into fits of giggles as his double asks him to stop interfering in the lesson, asks him to leave the room and tells him off when he tinkers with the microphone.

The video has already amassed 17,000 YouTube hits.

Mr Weather said: 'I like asking interesting questions or telling interesting stories but with a smaller class, it’s easier to do tricks on them.

'I upload my videos on YouTube so my students can see them but then other people start looking at them.'

One of his pupils, who commented on his latest skit, said Mr Weathers was 'a professor that brightens your day during class by bringing colour to an often not-too-interesting subject.'

Other YouTube viewers have criticized the video with one claiming that 'holding their attention does little if you don’t teach anything during that time.'

But another user has replied: 'Clearly the lesson did not end where the video stopped, so don’t be so quick to say this method of teaching didn’t help those students to understand the concept by actually making the lecture interesting.'

Shadow chasing: As Mr Weathers turns to his laptop a shadowy character runs across the screen

Is that me? It seemed that Mr Weather's shadow has a keen sense of humour and was happy to tease the teacher

Mr Weathers teaches 'Nature of Mathematics” where students learn about math’s history before diving into understanding it.

His other pranks on students include an April Fool’s Day joke where the shadow on the blackboard behind him starts to act on its own, dancing and making rude gestures behind his back.

In another, a Halloween Math Class, which has more than a million YouTube hits, the teacher appears to disappear behind a green screen.

A ghostly double of him then appears and the pair cause some mischief, spraying water at the class while spooky music plays in the background.

Finally a terrifying image of a ghoul is blasted at the class with the message 'Happy Halloween' terrifying the pupils who scream and laugh.
