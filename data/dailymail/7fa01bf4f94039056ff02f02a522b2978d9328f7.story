For motorists caught up in last month’s fuel panic, it will be a welcome sight.

And while there will be relief simply at the image of a tanker re-stocking a garage, the greater cause for optimism may be the men in uniform being taught how to operate it.

Teams of soldiers were being trained over Easter in preparation for a possible strike by militant tanker drivers over pensions and health and safety training concerns.

'Alarmed': Driver Jaz Hayer decided to fill up his tank the moment he saw the drill taking place - and he was sure he was not the only one

Unmarked tanker: Servicemen in full military uniform were seen training at an Esso filling station at a Tesco Express in Wednesfield, West Midlands

Despite talks between distributors and
the Unite union resuming yesterday in an attempt to avert a walkout, 
the sight of forces personnel operating tankers raises concern that 
industrial action remains a possibility.

One of the images of soldiers training
was taken at 7am on Monday by musician Jaz Hayer while filling up on 
the A46 between Leamington Spa and Warwick.

He said: ‘They were trying 
to do it discreetly but it is quite hard when there are so many people 
in uniform.’

Ominous images: Soldiers arrived at 11am and were seen being given instructions on how the filling station worked

Ready for action: The images are the strongest indication yet that strikes may take place

Worrying times: There was chaos last month as drivers fearing a strike began panic buying petrol and pumps ran dry across the country

Delivery firm Wincanton confirmed it 
was providing training for military drivers.

The Ministry of Defence 
said it was ‘prudent planning’ and that ‘several hundred’ Army tanker 
crews would be available if needed.

Unite will have to give seven days’ notice of any industrial action.
