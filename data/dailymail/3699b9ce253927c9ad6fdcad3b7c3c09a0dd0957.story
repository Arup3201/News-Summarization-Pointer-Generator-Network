The amount of money donated to the Treasury to help pay off the national debt has doubled in a year – thanks to one bequest of £420,000.

New figures from the Treasury show that nearly £800,000 was donated as gifts or bequests in the last financial year – up from £406,000 in 2012/13 – to help straighten out Britain's finances. 

This included a bequest from one individual of £420,576 – and another gift of just 78p.

While these acts of largesse will have been appreciated by Chancellor George Osborne, they will have had virtually no impact on Britain's huge overdraft.

Official figures from the Office for National Statistics last month showed that by November 2014 Britain's public sector net debt had reached £1,457billion.

Last night Lib Dem MP Norman Baker, who obtained the figures, said: 'It is encouraging that some have the sense of responsibility to help pay off the debt but it would be reduced much more quickly if some of the waste you see in government was eliminated.' 

A future Tory government would use part of a planned £23bn budget surplus by the end of the decade to fund the £7bn in tax cuts announced by David Cameron, the Chancellor confirmed. 

In a move to counter Labour claims that the Tories are pledging unfunded tax cuts, George Osborne  said his planned budget surplus would allow him to cut Britain's national debt and to reduce the tax burden.

Speaking at a joint economic event in Manchester with Mr Cameron earlier this week, he said: 'I think it is perfectly consistent to have spending plans that deliver the surplus, that reduce the national debt and to deliver those tax cuts that we have promised the British people because they are all part of the long-term economic plan.' 

He has also accused Labour of planning a secret 'tax bombshell' which could add 3p to income tax or three percentage points to national insurance.

The £23bn figure was an estimate by the Office for Budget of Responsibility of the impact of Osborne's fiscal plans in his autumn statement, which are designed to balance the overall budget by 2018.
