Former NFL quarterback Ryan Leaf has been moved from a drug treatment center to the Montana State Prison for threatening a staff member and other unspecified behavioral problems at the center, a corrections official said Thursday.

The former San Diego Chargers and Washington State Cougars quarterback was charged last spring with breaking into two houses and stealing prescription painkillers near his hometown of Great Falls, Montana.

Leaf, 36, was arrested on March 30, 2012, and again in a separate incident on April 2.

Back in jail: Ryan Leaf has been moved from a drug treatment center to state prison for threatening a staff member and other unspecified behavioral problems at the center, a corrections official said Thursday, January 17

He pleaded guilty in May to reduced 
charges, and his five-year sentence called for spending nine months in a
locked drug treatment facility as an alternative to prison.

Leaf said then that he was looking forward to the treatment at Nexus Treatment Center in Lewistown.

But on Thursday, the Montana Department of Corrections released a statement by Great Falls regional probation and parole administrator Dawn Handa that said Leaf will now serve his sentence in the Deer Lodge prison.

‘The Montana Department of Corrections terminated Leaf from the treatment program and placed him in prison after he was found guilty of behavior that violated conditions of his drug treatment program.

The violations included threatening a program staff member,’ Handa said in the statement.

Corrections officials did not immediately respond to a request for details of the violations or the threats.

Leaf’s attorney, Kenneth Olson, did not immediately return a call for comment.

It was unclear when the threats or other behavior issues occurred. The Department of Corrections’ website listing offenders says Leaf has been an inmate since January 10.

The Great Falls Tribune first reported Leaf’s imprisonment Thursday.It was not immediately clear how the change would affect a probation violation he is facing in Texas for 2010 drug charges.

Olson said in July that Randall County prosecutors had canceled their outstanding warrants so Leaf could serve his Montana sentence before facing possible penalties in Texas.

Leaf was charged with stealing prescription pain medicine from a player’s home while he was a coach at West Texas A&M.

An investigation also found he obtained nearly 1,000 pain pills from area pharmacies in an eight-month span.

His Montana conviction is a violation of his probation, prosecutors said.

Leaf was the No. 2 pick in the 1998 NFL draft, but his short-lived pro career earned him the reputation as one of the biggest busts in NFL history.

An investigation began in March 2011, after Great Falls postal workers reported they were suspicious of frequent packages Leaf received by paying COD charges of $500.

Central Montana Drug Task Force officers and Leaf’s parole officer confronted the former quarterback and found a container with 28 oxycodone pills inside and another container with a prescription made out to an acquaintance.

The acquaintance said Leaf had entered his home without permission, and Leaf was arrested.

Shortly after his release, two Cascade County residents told authorities they found Leaf inside their home.

The couple reported three different prescription medications missing.

Leaf was declared a fugitive earlier this year when Texan authorities issued two arrest warrants for the former star quarterback who was being sought for obtaining a controlled substance through fraud.

An investigation turned up that Leaf had obtained nearly 1,000 pain pills from area pharmacies in an eight-month span.

He was also charged with violating his probation. 

In 2010 Leaf was sentenced to 
10-year probation on drug and burglary charges.

Burn out: Leaf was the number two pick in the 1998 draft, second only to Peyton Manning

The former football pro became the No. 2 pick in the 1998 draft behind Peyton
Manning, who was scooped up by the Indianapolis colts.

Blaming injuries Leaf retired at 26 in 2002.

On March 30, 2012, he was arrested for possession of dangerous drugs and released after stumping up a $76,000 bail. Early on April 2 he was arrested again on burglary, theft and drug charges.

Days after being released on bail Leaf was found in the living room of a mobile home by the home's owners. They later discovered that bottles of prescription drugs were missing. 

His probation violation charge did not carry a bond so Leaf could not be released from jail.

The probation violation was related to a plea agreement Leaf made in Texas after being accused in 2009 of burglarizing a player's home while he was a quarterbacks coach for Division II West Texas A&M.

He released a statement through his publicist, Wendy Ogunsemore, on March 30, 2012.

'I've made some mistakes, and have no excuses,' the statement read.

'I am using the tools I've learned to move forward rather than backwards, and will be open to talking about the details in the days to come. I am confident that there will be further understanding when the facts are revealed, and feel very blessed for all of the support, especially from my friends and family.'

Authorities believe Leaf may have broken into other homes over the past one and a half years in search of prescription drugs and are asking those victims to come forward.

Last year, Leaf had surgery to remove a benign tumor from his brain stem and later underwent additional radiation treatments.

On March 21, 2012, Leaf told an Associated Press reporter in an email exchange that he had struggled through treatments and had an MRI scheduled for the end of the month, but 'I'm doing/feeling much better and am excited for the rest of 2012.'
