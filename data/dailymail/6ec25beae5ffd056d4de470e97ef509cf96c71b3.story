As interplanetary exploration goes, it could be a first.

Not content with sending rovers to Mars, scientists have revealed an ambitious plan to send a boat to Titan, Saturn's largest moon.

Engineers who unveiled their proposal at the European Planetary Science Congress today with a selection of potential craft powered by wheels, paddles and even a screw.

Saturn and its largest moon, Titan. Researchers hope to send a boat to the liquid gas lakes on the moon's surface.

Titan is one of the most Earth-like bodies in the Solar System.

With
 a thick atmosphere, a diameter between that of Earth and the planet 
Mercury, and a network of seas, lakes and rivers, it is in many respects
 more like a planet than a moon like the Earth’s.

The Cassini-Huygens mission, which studied Titan extensively in the 2000s, confirmed that lakes, seas and rivers of liquid hydrocarbons (similar to household gas) exist, covering much of the satellite’s northern hemisphere.

Although it eventually landed on solid ground, the Hugyens lander was designed to be able to float for a short period.

The new plans, called the Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer, proposes a boat-probe, propelled by wheels, paddles or screws.

The probe would land in the middle of Ligeia Mare (the biggest lake, near Titan’s north pole), then set sail for the coast, taking scientific measurements along the way.

The mission would last around six months to a year.

'The main innovation in TALISE is the propulsion system,' said Igone Urdampilleta (SENER), a member of the team developing the idea.

'This allows the probe to move, under control, from the landing site in the lake, to the closest shore.

'The displacement capability would achieve the obtaining of liquid and solid samples from several scientific interesting locations on Titan's surface such as the landing place, along the route towards the shore and finally at the shoreline.'

Researchers believe Titan's environment is too cold for life as we know it, but its environment, rich in the building blocks of life, is of great interest to astrobiologists.

The satellite's atmosphere is made up largely of nitrogen (like Earth’s), and is rich in organic compounds and hydrogen cyanide, which may have played a role in the emergence of life on Earth.

The TALISE concept is being developed as a partnership between SENER, a private engineering and technology group, and the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid, Spain.

This rendering of the proposed TALISE probe shows one possible means of propulsion: screws on either side of the probe.

A prototype using wheels is also being developed.

A third version using paddles is being considered by the team.
