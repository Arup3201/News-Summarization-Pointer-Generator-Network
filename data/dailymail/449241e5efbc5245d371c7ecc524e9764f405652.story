Inside a hotel room in this dreary industrial town in the Far East, a tearful Sebastian Vettel told his boss Christian Horner that he was leaving Red Bull for Ferrari, a deal that will earn him about £50million a year as the highest-paid driver in history.

Nico Rosberg’s pole position ahead of today’s typhoon-threatened Japanese Grand Prix, a place ahead of his championship rival and Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, was a mere sideshow in a febrile paddock of intrigue, open cheque books and revolving doors.

Vettel’s move was confirmed in a press release early yesterday morning Japanese time, just hours after Vettel texted Horner to ask if he could see him in his room. ‘I knew it wasn’t room service,’ said Horner with gallows humour of the 9.45pm message. Only minutes before he had confidently predicted Vettel would stay.

The move is sure to affect the top end of the driver market over the next few months:

Fernando Alonso is almost certain to make way for Vettel at Ferrari, with McLaren his most likely destination. The McLaren management, including chairman Ron Dennis, who fell out with Alonso during his single year at the team in 2007, are willing to be reunited with the turbulent Spaniard.

If Alonso does go to McLaren, rather than take a year’s sabbatical, he is likely to replace Jenson Button, possibly bringing an end to the Briton’s 15-year career in Formula One. McLaren sources have indicated privately that Alonso would be granted No 1 status and paired with a youthful No 2. Therefore, Kevin Magnussen, who only costs £500,000 a year, would stay and Button would go.

The Mail on Sunday understands that Hamilton has agreed in principle a new deal to keep him at Mercedes through to the end of 2017.

Typhoon Phanfone threatens both the smooth-running of the Japanese Grand Prix race and the dash out of Japan. The worst effects of the storm are due to hit Suzuka late tonight or tomorrow, when the sport’s people, cars and freight are trying to travel 6,000 miles to Sochi for next week’s Russian Grand Prix.

Regarding this Sunday's grand prix, an FIA spokesman said: ‘The timing for the organisers to change the race time has passed. We will see what is going on in the morning. The safety of the people has to be the most important thing.’

The possibility remains the race could run behind the safety car, with half-points an option should the race not be completed.

Red Bull confirmed that Vettel’s place will be taken by 20-year-old Russian Daniil Kvyat from the start of next season.

Ferrari will confirm Vettel in their driver line-up in the next few weeks. He will sign a three-year deal worth £150m.

The Mail on Sunday understands Vettel negotiated his deal directly with Sergio Marchionne, the new president of Ferrari and chairman of the Scuderia’s parent company Fiat. Neither outgoing Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo nor team principal Marco Mattiacci was actively involved in negotiations.

It is thought that Bernie Ecclestone, Vettel’s friend and mentor, advised the driver about the move. Vettel has no manager and negotiates his own highly lucrative deals.

Asked about Ecclestone’s guidance, Vettel said: ‘Mind your own business.’

Despite wearing the grungy look of a student doing America on 10 dollars a day, Vettel is said to be protective about his money. A new father, to Emily, he lives quietly on a farm in the tax haven of Switzerland, enjoying his privacy as much as his hero Michael Schumacher, whose feats at Ferrari he aspires to recreate.

It is understood that Vettel started to seek a move away following the Italian Grand Prix at the start of September.

In his five years with Red Bull, he won four world drivers’ titles and helped them to four constructors’ championships.

But he suffered dents to his stellar reputation this season after being regularly outclassed by team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, who has won three races to the German’s none.

Although Red Bull have massively outperformed Ferrari, they have not managed to match the dominance of Mercedes. That was the case again in qualifying yesterday, with Rosberg and Hamilton annexing the front row of the grid.

Rosberg was supremely quick on the most testing track in the world, finishing two-tenths of a second ahead of his title rival. Rosberg suffered electrical problems at the last race in Singapore, allowing Hamilton to take a three-point lead, but he is far from crushed.

That is more than could be said for Hamilton’s car after he broke his front suspension when he crashed into the tyre wall after carrying too much speed into the first corner in practice.

‘Nico was extremely quick today,’ admitted Hamilton. ‘I did the best I could. The guys did a great job to rebuild the car after I binned it. Today I just wasn’t feeling it. I don’t know why. Tomorrow is the day where you get the points so I’m looking forward to all the tricky weather.’

As for Vettel, he will start ninth, three places behind Ricciardo. But, naturally, he was still smiling. Laughing, in fact, all the way to the bank.
