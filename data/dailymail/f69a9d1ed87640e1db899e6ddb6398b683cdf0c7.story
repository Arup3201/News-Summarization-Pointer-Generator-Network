A child protection expert has warned that the BBC’s multi-million pound inquiry into the Jimmy Savile scandal is ‘too narrow’ to uncover the truth about the DJ.

Mark Williams-Thomas gave several hours of evidence to the Dame Janet Smith Review last week and is the first of its more than 140 witnesses to speak publicly about the experience.

He said Dame Janet ‘will never get to the bottom of what is really known’ about Savile because her inquiry’s remit does not extend far enough.

The former Surrey Police officer added: ‘I have enormous respect for Dame Janet Smith. However, it’s quite clear there is a lot of information out there her inquiry is not aware of.’

He said he believes the former Appeal Court judge, who cannot compel anyone to appear because of her inquiry’s non-statutory nature, may be ‘frustrated’ by this and urged for an ‘overarching’ inquiry.

He added: ‘There’s a significant amount of information that is slipping through the gap.’

The Smith Review, due to report this summer, was set up by the BBC to examine its culture and practices when Savile was there.
