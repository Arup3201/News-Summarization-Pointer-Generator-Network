Ipswich defender Aaron Cresswell is undergoing a medical ahead of a potential move to West Ham.

The 24-year-old left-back has emerged as favourite to join the Hammers as manager Sam Allardyce looks to boost his defensive options, with a move for Norwich’s Martin Olsson now believed to be dead in the water.

Cresswell has impressed in recent years at Portman Road, missing just four league games over the course of the last two seasons for the Sky Bet Championship club.

Highly rated: Cresswell had been attracting interest from several Premier League clubs

Having started his career at Tranmere, Cresswell moved to Ipswich in 2011 and now looks set to complete a move to West Ham and experience Barclays Premier League football for the first time in his career.

The news comes on the day West Ham’s current crop returned for pre-season training, where Allardyce posed for pictures with his two summer recruits to date - striker Mauro Zarate and defensive midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate.

Recognition: Cresswell was named in the Championship Team of the Year 

Having finished 13th in the league last season, Allardyce has been assured of his position by club owners David Sullivan and David Gold after a minority of Hammers fans began to vent their frustrations at the perceived negative tactics of the former Bolton and Newcastle boss.

With 14 clean sheets in the Premier League, West Ham’s survival was based on a sound defensive unit but Allardyce has been keen to add to his numbers at the back, with Cresswell likely to become his third addition ahead of the forthcoming campaign.
