Suarez's home debut ends in defeat and he has lost his first two Barca matches. The new tremendous front three has not worked out well so far!

Well that's all from me folks.

Thanks for tuning in!

Good night!

Well, that game was quite incredible.

Barca had tens of chances - and on another day Messi, Suarez and Neymar would EACH have had hat-tricks - but they have lost 1-0 at home to Celta Vigo.

Celta put in a phenomenal shift and, thanks to a goal from Larrivey and some magnificent shot-stopping from Alvarez, they ensure Barca remain third in the table behind Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.

Suarez must have thought he had scored a goal on his home debut, but Alvarez had other ideas.

After Suarez received the ball in the middle of the box he smashes a shot across the goal and Alvarez dives well to his right and gets a massive hand to it to turn it around the post.

Incredible save.

The substitute Charles receives the ball on his chest, facing away from goal and 10 yards out.

He does two keep-ups, flicks it over Mathieu and then tries to chip it over Bravo who makes the save.

That would have been a wondergoal.

Barcelona have hit the woodwork FOUR times in this game now.

Messi takes a free-kick from 25 yards which whips and curls before rattling the very top-right hand corner of the goalframe.

How have they not scored?

Celta are still looking dangerous on the counter attack and Nolito nearly doubles the lead.

He receives a cross and volleys the ball at Bravo who saves low, only for substitute Charles to hit the rebound over the bar.

Very wasteful from Messi who whips the free-kick high and wide from the edge of the area.

Gomez is a bit unlucky because it seems he got the ball but he has given away a free-kick on the edge of the box and gotten booked in the process.

Suarez and Neymar perform a one-two and Gomez hauls the former down.

It really has the feeling that it might be one of those days.

Barca have had a ridiculous number of chances and Alvarez has made countless saves.

This time Pedro crosses to Suarez who, along with two other Barca players, is completely unmarked in the box but he heads straight into Alvarez's hands.

Large swathes of the Nou Camp sit in quiet bemusement.

This was not what the home unveiling of the Suarez-Messi-Neymar attacking trident was meant to be like.

It is quite incredible that they haven't scored yet but Barca are behind.

Messi whips a corner in but it is easily cleared and Enrique needs to make some changes here.

Alvarez does make a good save with his foot from Messi though.

Messi whips in a free-kick from the left-hand side and Johny does well to nod it out for a corner.

Barca are getting a bit desperate now, but they have missed countless chances already.

Incredible, absolutely incredible.

Awful defending from Dani Alves, who does not get rid of the ball and Nolito does a wonderful backheel.

Busquets loses the run of Larrivey and he sticks the ball into the bottom right-hand corner.

Barca have been wasteful but Celta have also looked quite solid at times.

Yes, the home side could have had four or five, but Johnny and Radoja have been particularly good for the visitors.

Jordi Alba breaks down the left and he passes the ball square to Neymar who is only eight yards out.

His finish is quite lethargic though and the ball hits the bar and goes over once more.

A goal must come soon... surely...

Surely it's only a matter of time before one of Barca's star strikers score because they simply have too much quality not to find the back of the net soon.

Expect Barcelona to go full throttle after the break.

The Suarez, Messi, Neymar front three has burst into life in fits and starts but there's more to come and the crowd knows it.

No whistles at half-time, which is rare - if Barcelona aren't winning, there's normally a few complaints. 

Neymar has been denied again.

The Brazilian is clean through on goal and puts a shot across the keeper but Alvarez does brilliantly to tip it wide of the post.

Alvarez has been on top, top form here.

He has shown glimpses Suarez but he has still not reached the heights of last season as he recovers his fitness.

The Uruguayan hits a left-footed shot from just outside the area and Alvarez does well to dive to his left and save it.

Celta have had to endure a bombardment of attacks but they have also offered some threat themselves.

Nolito is making a nuisance of himself and Larrivey has also been decent, with Hernandez and Gomez offering some threat in the air too.

Both sides have had chances and Messi in particular you would have expected to have scored by now.

He has had at least three opportunities, as has Neymar, and yet neither have found the back of the net.

Messi has had another glorious chance and how has the ball not gone in?

Neymar threads his team-mate through and he round the keeper before sliding the ball towards goal and Johny slides in.

The ball seems destined for the back of the net but Johny clears it off the line and on to the crossbar.

Neymar does brilliantly and he cuts the ball back for Lionel Messi, who curls a shot towards goal.

The effort has pace and Sergio Alvarez in the Celta goal does brilliantly to tip it over and wide for a corner.

Barcelona supporters chant Luis Enrique's name, a show of support, despite the club's humbling at the hands of arch-rivals Real Madrid last weekend. 

Neymar should have had a hat-trick but Hernandez has come close from a corner.

Celta are looking decent here and from set pieces they look extremely dangerous.

Disappointing from Suarez, who messes up his central pass in a good attacking area... Celta then break but Nolito's effort deflects into Bravo's hands.

As usual in the 17th minute the crowd chant for independence. It's louder than usual today, as we approach the date which the (now cancelled) referendum had been set for.

The crowd here have seen Suarez once before, in a cameo role at the end of a pre-season friendly. Now they're getting the real deal and there's an electricity in the atmosphere when he gets on the ball. That said, it's been Neymar who has come the closest to scoring. 

Celta are given a free-kick 20 yards out in a great area.

Nolito breaks free and Mascherano just catches him...

Nolito, the former Barca player, steps up... but it's well over the bar. He should have done better, getting well underneath it.

Yellow card for Hernandez of Celta after a collision in mid-air with Busquets. Not sure why... but the referee seems to think he's elbowed the Spanish midfielder.

Replays show he didn't... but good old Sergio Busquets is making the most of it.

CHANCE! Neymar could have had a hat-trick already... the Brazilian curls a pearler from 20 yards but hits the bar and goes clear. Great effort, surely a goal is just around the corner.

CHANCE! Celta clear a free-kick but Rakitic whips in a delightful ball from the left... Neymar is unmarked but his header is straight at Sergio from eight yards. Good chance wasted again by Barcelona's top scorer.

CHANCE! Suarez twists and turns and plays a great ball into Neymar inside the area... the Brazilian takes a touch when he really doesn't need to.

It brings him away from goal and Celta Vigo recover. The visitors already split open and Barca are pressing well.

Rakitic releases Suarez down the left wing, but his cross is too deep and picked up by Rafinha near the touchline. His pull-back doesn't reach Alaba and goalkeeper Sergio collects.

Barca haven't let Celta have a touch as yet, as you'd expect. The visitors are sixth in La Liga, with 16 points, eight off leaders Real Madrid.

Luis Enrique needs a performance after the Clasico defeat, and will it come against his former side?

'An air of anticipation at the Nou Camp with Luis Suarez set to make his home debut.

'But with all eyes on the Uruguayan could Lionel Messi take his thunder by netting two and overtaking Telmo Zarra as La Liga's all time top goalscorer?'
