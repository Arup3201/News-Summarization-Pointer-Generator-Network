This playful bear clearly forgot his table manners when he was treated to a teddy bears picnic.

The big friendly beast couldn't help rolling about on the tabletop as his keeper laid on an al fresco lunch.

But, as the song goes, that is the way teddy bears have their picnics.

The bear lives at an outdoor park with Sulo Karjalainen - known to many in his native Finland as 'the bearman'.

The 73-year-old runs Kuusamo Large 
Carnivore Centre with his brother Jalo in the north of the country, 
which has been home to more than 20 orphaned brown bears.

He
 was born in 1941 in Rovaniemi, but has spent most of his life on the 
same farm in Kuusamo - seeing his first wild bear before the age of ten.

'If you're born in the woods, there's something of the animal in you too,' Mr Karjalainen said.

'People know me because of the animals. That makes me happy. When you've lived in the forest since childhood, you're naturally close to animals.'

The bearman's family ran a dairy cattle farm - and in the absence of a babysitter, his mother was happy to leave her young son to play in the sheep pen, before picking him up in the afternoon.

The family gave up farming after Finland joined the EU in 1995, at which point Mr Karjalainen  began working on a research project studying Finnish carnivores.

And it wasn't long before the animal-lover was asked if he would mind taking in a pair of orphaned cubs. Over the years a deep bond has grown up between Sulo and his furry companions.

'I look after them until they were well, and if they couldn't be released into the wild again, they stayed here with me,' Mr Karjalainen said.

'It's all just happened naturally and it's been very rewarding. I've always aimed to give the animals everything they need and make sure they lead good lives.'

The Fin is bemused to have become a celebrity in his homeland due to his incredible relationship with the predators - even starring in his own TV documentary.

And while he isn't afraid of the bears but he is always careful with them.

'Bears are very playful animals and if you aren't aware of what they're doing, you might get hurt,' the Fin added.

'One time a bear cut my cheek open with his claw while he was trying to play with me.'

At present Mr Karjalainen looks after six bears - and the 'bearman' has no plans to retire any time soon.
