Air passengers face long delays at passport control this Easter because of ‘gridlock’ caused by a shortage of border staff, the UK’s major airlines have warned.

Their grim predictions were borne out last night when passengers at Heathrow complained of two and a half hour delays.

One Terminal 5 passenger, Erica North, who had flown in from San Francisco, said only three of the 25 immigration desks were manned.

The 29-year-old psychologist said: ‘It’s horrendous. I’ve been waiting two and a half hours. The whole waiting area is full and no one is explaining what’s going on.’

The chaotic scenes follow a broadside at the Government by the UK’s 11 leading airlines including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, bmi British Midland and easyJet, who said millions of passengers are facing ‘unacceptable’ queues getting back into the country.

They told Home Secretary Theresa May that staff shortages at immigration, bottlenecks and inefficiencies mean: ‘At peak travel periods such as the Easter holidays, there is the very real chance of gridlock at UK airports.’

They said the problem has been exacerbated by a return to ‘100 per cent passport checks’ – following a row last year over lax checks – at a time when UK Border Force staff numbers have been cut.

The predictions of Easter air chaos were made in leaked letters to Mrs May from the British Air Transport Association representing the 11 major UK airlines, and in a back-up one from Virgin Atlantic which spoke of impending ‘gridlock at peak travel periods, such as the Easter holidays.’

The letter from BATA chief executive Simon Buck said: ‘The UK Border Force will almost certainly struggle to manage the volume of passengers and queue times at major airports will lengthen.

‘The subsequent impact on airline operations, passenger experience and satisfaction could be significant, especially at peak travel times such as Easter or during the Queen’s Jubilee celebrations.’ The aim was to shame the Government into abandoning further cuts in Border Force staff.

British Airways is expecting today to be its busiest day over the Easter holiday with up to 86,000 passengers travelling.

More than a million passengers are set to arrive at Heathrow alone between now and the end of the Easter school break. Sunday, April 15 is expected to be the busiest day with 123,350 arriving home ahead of the new school term.

Airports say ‘unacceptable’ peak time queues can already exceed two hours, but the Immigration Service Union says that at the worst times they can exceed four and half hours leaving thousands crammed into arrivals halls.

Lucy Moreton, the union’s deputy general secretary, warned security was at risk from job cuts. ‘Those who would wish us harm only need to be lucky once,’ she said.

Unions say ministers will have to draft in ‘contingency’ border staff who have recently retired and with a maximum of two-days’ refresher training because current staffing rosters ‘are not flexible.’

The Home Office said it was putting more Border Force staff on passport control duty over the Easter holiday – but declined to say how many.

Brian Moore, head of the 7,400-strong UK Border Force, insisted: ‘There’s not a problem. My job is to make sure our borders are secure. This speculation is unhelpful, unnecessary and alarmist.’

A Border Force spokesman said: ‘The Border Force is prepared for the busy Easter period and has ensured extra staff will be working to carry out vital security checks.’

Departures from Liverpool, Luton and Gatwick to Nice were among those cancelled, with other routes to and from the regional French hub airports severely affected.

And a looming strike by Spanish pilots has forced British Airways partner Iberia to cancel journeys between Heathrow and Madrid on Easter Monday.

Passengers hoping to travel over the Easter weekend - a peak time when 1.5million holiday makers expect to travel overseas - have been warned to check for delays.

But it is not all bad news. The threat of a baggage-handlers strike by staff at Stansted this weekend has been lifted while negotiations between the GMB union and Swissport, the ground handling company, continue.

But this development is likely to come as little relief for anyone booked on an Iberia flight. Pilots are planning to strike on Mondays and Fridays from April 9 until July 20 due to a dispute over a new low-cost subsidiary, Iberia Express, set to take over loss-making routes.
