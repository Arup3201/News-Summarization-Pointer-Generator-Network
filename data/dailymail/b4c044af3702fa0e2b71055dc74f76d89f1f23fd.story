At first glance, these images might look like something belonging on a film set about paranormal activity.

But these mind-blowing photographs are infact the works of a French 'camouflage' artist who uses his paintbrush to make people 'disappear' from pictures.

Laurent La Gamba uses crafty techniques to make his models blend into a series of ordinary and bizarre objects - including fridges, sports cars and supermarket shelves.

The 47-year-old also creates images in which the models vanish into the likes of supermarket shelves (pictured) and flash sports cars 

The 47-year-old, from Paris, spends up to two hours intricately painting each person with acrylics before positioning them with incredible precision and photographing them in front of the objects.

The finished result is the illusion that the models are 'hovering' in front of the objects.

Mr La Gamba has described his photos as 'procryptic', a word normally used to define the protective colouring found in insects who use camouflage against their enemies.

Last year, the married father-of-two first created a spectacular set of images by blending his friends and family with a range of top sports cars.

The project, which merged his love of cars and art, used three BMWs and two Porsches for his latest work and was shot in the Pyrenees, southern France, where he has a studio.

He said: 'Each shoot takes about a day. The people who model in my set are my friends and family.

Mr La Gamba, from Paris, gives the models the appearance that they are 'hovering' in front of the chosen objects, including this flag 

He described his photos as 'procryptic' - a word normally used for the protective colouring in insects used to camouflage against enemies

'I wanted to enrich my camouflage work and make the camouflage more difficult technically by using a moving image. I am a painter, I paint the installation myself in full. 

'They make me proud and I have great fun in the process of making them.

'Some people laugh, some people admire it - others think it is software generated, so there is really a wide variety of reactions.'

In one collection, the married artist used three BMWs and two Porsches to create the 'disappearing' images over sports cars 

He said that all of his artworks are original and are in no way re-touched or digitally edited

The models are usually friends or members of Mr La Gamba's family. He even appears in the images himself, from time to time
