Figure skater Nancy Kerrigan, who captured the nation's heart after she rebounded from a brutal attack on her legs and competed at the 1994 Winter Olympics, is speaking out about the other tragedy in her life - the 2010 death of her father and subsequent arrest and imprisonment of her brother.

Kerrigan, now 43, said her brother Mark should never have been charged with causing her father Daniel's death. Mark was sentenced to two and a half years in prison after being convicted of assault and battery.

In
January 2010, Nancy's father Daniel Kerrigan died after a fight with 
his son Mark at his home in Middlesex County, Massachusetts

The whack heard 'round the world: This image of Kerrigan clutching her leg after a baton attack orchestrated by a rival's ex-husband in 1994 caused international sympathy for the young skater

An autopsy of the 70-year-old revealed that he died of a heart attack following the assault.

Prosecutors
alleged that Mark's battery of his father caused the heart attack and 
charged him with involuntary manslaughter - despite objections from 
Nancy Kerrigan and her mother.

Kerrigan stands by her brother to this day.

'He shouldn’t have been charged. My dad had a heart attack and that’s that,' the 43-year-old told NBC's Today show on Friday

'He’s
just getting on with his life. I’m sure it's not easy when it’s brought
up like this because unfortunately being my (brother) it’s brought up 
again, which is really too bad for him because he wants to move on with 
his life.'

Mark Kerrigan was
found not guilty of manslaughter, but a jury convicted him of assault 
and battery. A judge sentenced him to the maximum of two and half years 
in prison, citing past drug abuse and a DUI conviction.

Nancy Kerrigan also revealed that she has traded in 
her lucrative career as a professional figure skater for domestic 
duties. She is the mother of three children.

'I
drive my kids everywhere. It's by choice because I drive and drive and 
drive and cook and clean and that's basically what I do now,' .

Kerrigan
has been married to her former agent Jerry Soloman for nearly 20 years.
Their children Matthew, Brian and Nicole are ages 16, 8 and 5.

Nancy Kerrigan made national news in January 1994 when a man bashed her on the leg with a baton during the practice for the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. 

TV news footage of Kerrigan wailing 'Why? Why? Why'? as she clutched her leg ran around the world.

An investigation revealed that the attacker was hired by the ex-husband and body guard of Kerrigan's rival Tonya Harding. Harding later admitted to knowing about the attack in advance and not spotting it.

She was stripped up her skating titles and banned from the sport for life.

Kerrigan recovered from the leg injury and competed in the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. At the Olympics, she gave what she considers two of the best performances of her life, but was awarded the silver medal after controversially scoring just 0.1 point below Ukrainian Oksana Baiul. 

Kerrigan told the Today show that she might be  a full-time mom now, but she hasn't hung up the skates entirely.

She still performs in exhibitions arranged by her husband.
