A married couple have revealed how they have been given a new lease of life after taking up pole dancing. Steve Hind and wife Lisa from Runcorn, Cheshire, have lost ten stone between them thanks to their new hobby and have even started pole dancing competitively.

Lisa, 27, explained how they took up the class after seeing it advertised one evening as they walked home from having a curry.

She said: 'We walked past a dance studio and 
there was a sign about pole dancing classes. Steve said he'd love to do it. I 
thought he was joking and started laughing. Then I realised he wasn't so
we went in and had a look.

Passionate: The pair train every day and have started entering competitions

'We knew the gym wasn't an option and we wanted to do something together. We didn't know it was going to change our lives.'

Lisa said after a tricky start, she soon got the hang of it. 'The first class was 
horrendous. I couldn't even lift myself up the pole. Steve took to it 
like a duck to water though. He was the only guy in the class but he 
didn't mind. I stuck to it - I was determined to get to where he was.'

After mastering the basic moves, they are now performing complex routines including aerial silk, where they perform acrobatics 
while hanging from a special fabric. As well as pole fitness classes, the couple also do Bokwa, an intense cardio workout.

As a result, the couple have transformed their body shapes. Steve, 48, has lost just over four stone, shrinking from 14st 13lb to a trim 10st 10lb,  while Lisa has done even better by shedding almost six stone - and can now slip into a size ten dress.

Belly disappeared: People used to joke that Steve looked pregnant but he's now got a six pack

Lisa, who has gone from 15st 13lb to exactly 10st, said: 'After two weeks I noticed a difference. My stomach wasn't as big. We loved it so much we decided to go every night of the week. We train for four hours - five on a Monday.

'We're having so much fun, it doesn't feel like a chore. We want to be there. I'm so happy. I'm bouncing with energy and have a real spring in my step. Now
we're dancing all the time, we hardly ever go out. When people see us, 
they think we've had surgery because we've lost weight so quickly.'

The couple's new lifestyle is a far cry from how they used to live after they married six years ago.

They would eat out four nights a week and couldn't resist their
daily trips to McDonalds for a super size burger and fries.

Mastered the moves: The couple are now experts at pole dancing

Lisa said: 'When I met Steve I thought we were alright. Then we
started going out for meals and we had the wine or had cosy nights in 
with take-always. We were all in love but we didn't realise what it was doing to our bodies. We got stuck in a rut.

'I couldn't fit into nice clothes and was going up sizes. Steve's belly was that big, people joked he was pregnant.'

Lisa, a full-time housewife, was a 
size 14 when she met Steve, a bus driver, in 2007 and they married six 
months later after a whirlwind romance. By their wedding day, she had already gone up a dress size.

She said: 'It happened so fast I didn't get chance to think about slimming down but I still felt comfortable. I've always been a curvy girl with broad shoulders and big legs. I had it in my head that it was just me.

Weight has fallen off: The couple say they have never felt better since they ditched their unhealthy diets and joined the dance classes

'When we got married, we were always 
going out and socialising with friends. You could get two jugs of 
cocktails for £10 so we'd get two each.

'Every week we went to the curry night and then the steak night at our local pub. We had McDonalds most days. They would ask you if you wanted a large for an extra few pence and we could never resist.

'I'd feel stuffed afterwards but then
we'd go home and have sweet and sour chicken for dinner. I didn't think
how much damage it was doing. I never weighed myself - I didn't know 
what scales were.

'I tried different diets. You go 
through stages of being good. I cut out bread and sugar. They were my 
vices. But it's the worst thing you can do. It just doesn't work.

'I went to the gym but I got bored. With me, I want to see results fast and if I don't, I think it's not going to happen.'

'Addicted': Steve said he even uses the pole on the bus to practice his moves

Then in December 2011, with all the Christmas treats on the shelves, the couple decided enough was enough.

Steve said: 'I'd never been that big 
in my life. The guys at work called me Buddha because of my belly. I was
getting embarrassed.

'I noticed Lisa had got bigger too. 
I'd love her whatever size she was - big or small - but we both realised
how much we'd changed.'

The determined duo stopped drinking and cut down on fast food but the real turning point was when they discovered their love of pole dancing. 

'Pole dancing is addictive - we do it seven nights a week. It's fun doing it together. We've never felt better,' Lisa said.

New lease of life: The pair said friends thought they must have had surgery to get their slim figures, left, but it's all thanks to their passion for pole dancing

Two months ago, the couple even 
entered a pole dancing competition at LaKiTa Dance Academy, Warrington, 
where they train, and Lisa came second while Steve came fourth.

Lisa said: 'We weren't going to enter
at first but our instructor encouraged us to. Steve bought some tiny 
gold hot pants just Kylie's and threw them on the floor afterwards when 
he found out I'd beat him but we don't take it too seriously.

Now they are preparing to enter their first doubles competition as the first husband and wife team in the summer. And it's not just in the competitions where they are drawing attention.

Steve said: 'We were out on New 
Year's Eve and I jumped on the pole. I did the scorpio move where you 
hang upside down by one leg. Everyone was clapping.

'I even use the pole on my bus to practice. All the lads at the depot know about me pole dancing and think it's great. I've nearly got a six pack. We can both fit in kids' clothes. I feel fantastic. It's a new lease of life.'
