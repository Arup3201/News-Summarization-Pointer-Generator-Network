When S Club 7 announced their reunion this week, hundreds of thousands of 30-something Brits began to feel old.

The teeny bopper band, who were launched by Simon Fuller after he was dropped by the Spice Girls, got their first No.1 with Bring It All Back in June, 1999 - a whole 15 years ago. 

The world before Facebook, Instagram, iPhones and reality television now seem a million years ago.  

S Club 7 had their first No.1 with Bring It All Back in 1999. In that same year, the Wasssup! Budweiser advert launched and Britney Spears released Hit Me Baby One More Time 

The band  have now reformed in 2014 - fifteen years later and the world seems a different place with Facebook, Instagram, iPhones and reality television

Back in 1999, every lovesick teen across the country was tuning into Dawson's Creek, while the rest were shouting the 'Wasssssuuuup!' catchphrase made famous by the Budweiser adverts. 

An unknown American teen who went by the name of Britney Spears rocketed to stardom after appearing on TV screens in a skimpy school uniform to the sounds of Hit Me Baby One More Time.

Fashion-wise, girls were putting butterfly clips in their hair, while young adults were all showing off their newly-inked Chinese symbol tattoos.  

It was a big year for the news too - the Euro launched at the beginning of January, Prince Edward got married to Sophie Rhys-Jones and we were all obsessed with the potential of the Millennium Bug to cause a global meltdown. 

Femail looks back at some of the biggest trends of 1999 - what we were watching, wearing, listening to and reading about:  

 

What we listened to:   

Britney Spears: Before 1999, no one had heard of Britney Spears, but by the end of the year, everyone had heard of the teen from Louisiana and her catchy hit Hit Me Baby One More Time.

Skunk Anansie:

Glastonbury in 1999 was sadly overshadowed by the death of organiser Michael Eavis's wife Jean.

But the show still goes on and the headline acts for that year's Pyramid Stage were Skunk Anansie, REM and Manic Street Preachers.

Cliff Richard: 

Cliff Richard released the Millenium Prayer - a single where he sang the Lord's Prayer to the tune of Auld Lang Syne. 

The track was banned by several radio stations including Radio 1 and Capital FM, but it still managed to get to No.1 in the singles chart.

Westlife: 

In the days before X Factor and Pop Idol, there was still a fair race to Christmas No.1 in the charts.

 Westlife bagged the coveted  spot with their track  I Have A Dream in 1999.

Trends: 

 

Chinese symbol tattoos: 

Chinese symbol tattoos were one of the first widespread body ink crazes among the British middle class. 

The designs that claimed to say inspirational words like, 'Hope' and 'Destiny' must also be partly responsible for the rise in tattoo removals. 

1999 started the huge trend for Chinese symbol tattoos 

 

Butterfly clips: 

Butterfly clips and hair mascara were the biggest hair accessories of 1999. 

Quantity over quality every time - the more, the better. 

Butterfly clips were the big hair accessory, as seen on Shannon Elizabeth at the American Pie Premiere

 

Baggy Cargo trousers:

All Saints were at their peak in 1999, with hits like Booty Call and Never Ever under their belts, they were officially Britain's coolest girlband. 

Young women across the country responded by buying the group's signature style - baggy trousers and vest tops - in bulk.

'The Rachel' haircut: 

If anyone can call themselves responsible for the haircut of a generation - Jennifer Aniston can. 

The actress's layered long bob in the sitcom Friends spawned millions of copycats across the western world.

Brooklyn Beckham: 

Brooklyn Beckham was born to David and Victoria Beckham in 1999 - he is supposed to be named after the area of New York that he was conceived in. 

The name spawned thousands of variations by Beckham fans, including one child named  Number 16 Bus Shelter.

Wasssuuup! Budweiser advert: 

The catchphrase for 1999 was most definitely Wasssuuuup! after the word was made famous in the Budweiser advert of that year. 

The commercial also raised the bar for beer adverts across the drinks industry.  

Thew Wasssuuup! Budweiser advert was a favourite of 1999 

 

The Nokia 3210: 

Long before the iPhone made it's way on our high streets, the Nokia was king of the mobile phones. 

The start of texting your mates and of course... Snake.  

The Nokia 3210 was the must-have phone in 1999 

 

What we watched:  

 

Gwyneth Paltrow's Oscar acceptance speech: 

Who could forget THAT acceptance speech in THAT dress. 

The moment Gwyneth collected her gong for Best Actress for 'Shakespeare in Love' and subsequent tearful thank you speech (with no tears) has been parodied numerous times over the years.

Dawson's Creek: 

Dawson's Creek was the one-stop shop for lovesick teens everywhere. 

Two series in by 1999, no one had worked out whether Dawson would ever kiss Joey.

The Big Breakfast: 

Kelly Brook took over from Denise Van Outen on The Big Breakfast in February, 1999. 

She was replaced just five months later by Liza Tarbuck.

Bad Girls: 

Bad Girls started in 1999 and was so popular that it went on to be broadcast in 17 different countries.

The Matrix: 

The Matrix was released in 1999, kick-starting a trend for strange sunglasses, long leather jackets and conspiracy theories. 

In the Matrix, Keanu Reeves plays Neo, a computer hacker who discovers that the world around him is a computer simulation 

 

What was in the news:   

The Millennium Bug: 

It's hard to believe now, but the Millennium Bug was of genuine concern to pretty much everyone in Britain in 1999. 

It was a computer problem that many feared would shut down every computer on the stroke of midnight between December 31,1999 and January 1, 2000, causing chaos to government, hospitals, finance and every other industry that relied on technology.

A royal wedding: 

Wedding of Prince Edward, youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II married Sophie Rhys-Jones at St George's Chapel Windsor, Saturday June 19, 1999. 

From then on, the couple have been known as the Earl and Countess of Wessex.

The solar eclipse: 

1999 saw the first total solar eclipse in Britain since 1927.

The Euro: 

The European Union's single currency was formally launched at the beginning of 1999, heralding what EU leaders said would be an era of stability and prosperity
