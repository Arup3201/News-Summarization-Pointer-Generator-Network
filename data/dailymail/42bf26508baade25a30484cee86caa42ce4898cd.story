Read Matt Lawton and Ian Ladyman on Dave Whelan's outburst

Even when it was spelt out to him, even when the conversation ventured into the history of slavery, Dave Whelan could not grasp what the problem was. He became confused, exasperated.

‘I don’t know what all this is about,’ he said on Thursday.

Just as Wigan Athletic’s 77-year-old owner could see no issue with appointing Malky Mackay as his new manager when the Scot remains the subject of an FA investigation into allegations of racism, sexism and homophobia, he could not understand why anything he had said might also offend people.

His defence was one we hear all too often, even in 2014. He spoke the language of the bigot, arguing that there was no difference between abusing someone for being Chinese and calling a white English person a ‘Limey’.

I’ve known Whelan for years, and he once asked me to write his book. We got as far as writing a synopsis before I stood down as his ghost because I realised I didn’t have the time.

But his life story was fascinating, and not just because he once declined an invitation to buy Manchester United for £11million because he feared football fans who did not follow United might boycott his sports stores.

There was a story from his childhood during the Second World War. He jumped on a bus in Wigan one day and asked a soldier sitting opposite him if he could hold his rifle. The soldier asked where he was getting off. He then asked which street he lived in. And then the number of his house. ‘David?’ asked the soldier. ‘Yes?’ said young Whelan. ‘David, I’m your dad,’ said the soldier.

The story highlights the fact that Whelan is of a certain generation; a man who has failed to evolve if we first assume that his comments are not motivated by racial hatred.

I don’t believe that they are. But what I do wonder is if this powerful and immensely wealthy man has ever had his views challenged before Thursday night.

There was nobody in his immediate circle strong enough to stop him pressing ahead with the appointment of Mackay. At first last night he had no recollection of even giving an interview to The Guardian. ‘I’ve not given an interview today,’ he said. 

And then, when reminded of the anti-Semitic remarks he is reported to have made, he replied: ‘What the lad says was some Jewish person liked money, and I said of course Jewish people like money. We all like money. Jewish people are no different than us.’

There can be no disputing what he said in that car crash of a Press conference at Wigan the previous day. Whelan described Mackay as ‘unlucky’ and said he could see little wrong with the deeply offensive comments his new manager had made in a series of text messages and emails.

I asked him if he realised the damage he had done. ‘Malky criticised somebody and called them a name,’ he said. ‘We all get called names. We get called Limeys, Brits. The Scots get called Jocks. And we don’t take a blind bit of notice.’

I then asked him if he realised there was a distinction that needed to be recognised. ‘There’s a big difference if you criticise a black person because that is something I would never ever do or agree to,’ he said.

But did he understand why? ‘I would never even dream of that,’ he said. ‘That is something that is totally taboo. Everybody on the planet is equal.’

In 2011 Whelan gave a radio interview saying black players were ‘out of order’ to complain when racially abused on a football pitch. He said he remembered the interview. ‘I believe we are all equal,’ he repeated.

Still not convinced he appreciated why there was a difference between calling someone a ‘Limey’ and racially abusing a black person, I raised the subject of slavery. He agreed slavery was ‘wrong’. I go to Barbados a lot,’ he said. ‘I have friends, black people, white people, everybody is the same.’

Mackay was unveiled at a press conference at the DW Stadium on Wednesday

How did he feel about a company terminating their sponsorship of Wigan shirts? ‘I’m sorry,’ he said. ‘It’s a free world and they’ve made the decision that they want to take.’

But was he not concerned he had damaged the reputation of a football club he has done so much to establish in the modern era?

‘I hope I’ve not, because I have no intention of doing that,’ he said. ‘But I think when it gets to the end of the season there may be a big change in attitude, even after a few games. 

Matt Lawton’s August exclusives led the way over Mackay, who was back at Wigan on Wednesday

'The man we have appointed, he’s a very honest and open man. He’s done something wrong. He’s made the apology. Let’s forgive and forget.’

As Whelan is about to discover, it is not that simple. There will be consequences and they could go way beyond joining Mackay on an FA charge. They could end with his legacy at Wigan seriously damaged, and that would be a pity when I’m not sure he will ever understand why.

Mackay could still face disciplinary action from the Football Association

We wish to make it clear The FA investigation into the conduct of Malky Mackay and Iain Moody remains ongoing and no assurances have been given by The FA as to the outcome of this case.

In the particular and exceptional circumstances of this case, The FA would like to provide some clarification as to the status of the investigation.

The FA did not come into possession of the relevant evidence relating to the messages until mid-October.

This came out of many thousands of emails and texts and we are still in the process of obtaining additional information.

The FA is still investigating whether these messages indicate a culture in which other acts of a discriminatory nature may have taken place.

This process inevitably takes time.

Both Mr Mackay and Mr Moody are fully co-operating with the ongoing process.

We fully appreciate the need to act expeditiously on this matter.

However, it remains a complex investigation and The FA will make no further comment at this time.
