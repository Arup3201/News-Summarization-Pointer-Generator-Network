Denial: Elsa Van Der Welt is also accused of revealing patients details

A nurse bragged about her sexual escapades with another member of staff in front of patients, a tribunal heard yesterday.

Elsa Van Der Walt regularly boasted about her sex life and discussed colleagues’ personal lives while on duty at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridgeshire, it was said.

She also breached patient confidentiality by sharing information about eating-disorder sufferers, the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told.

Giving evidence, former colleague Zoe Brown said she felt uncomfortable with Van Der Walt’s behaviour at work.

When Miss Brown began a relationship with an electrician working on the hospital site in 2010, Van der Walt talked about it in front of patients, the tribunal heard.

‘I was a care worker at Addenbrooke’s,’ Miss Brown said. ‘I had formerly been a patient myself at the hospital suffering from an eating disorder.

‘My relationship with Elsa very frosty and fractious … She would compare me to service users [patients] on the ward and say that I was “one of them” rather than a staff member.

‘She made it very clear she didn’t think I should work there because of my history as an eating-disorder sufferer.’

Miss Brown said her relationship with the electrician was common knowledge on the ward, but that they wanted to be discreet. ‘We didn’t ignore each other at work but we didn’t go out of our way to have contact,’ she said.

‘Elsa used to make lots of comments if me and my partner were near each other in front of the service users.

‘She made inappropriate comments about things which were untrue – for example, she would say that me and my partner had had sex with each other on the ward … Often I was just embarrassed and said I didn’t want to speak about it.

‘It’s something I would never feel comfortable talking about in front of patients. The service users were shocked and embarrassed and they would agree with me that it was not appropriate, and ask whether I was OK.’

Van der Walt did not hold back from discussing her own sex life in front of the patients and talked about her antics with a junior doctor.

Miss Brown told the hearing: ‘There were times when conversations occurred about a junior doctor on the ward – this was something that also made service users uncomfortable.

‘As people suffering from eating disorders, sex and relationships may be something that the service users feel hard to discuss.

‘It was discussed that Elsa had been swimming and that this junior doctor had taken a liking to her. Elsa then described spending a night with him.’

It was heard she regularly boasted about her sex life  while on duty at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridgeshire

Miss Brown also accused Van der Walt of having ‘favourites’ on the ward, something which had a negative effect on her relationship with other patients.

Van der Walt would bring her ‘favourites’ gifts back from holidays, the panel heard.

The nurse also discussed issues such as patients’ weight, eating habits, and a particular service user’s history of stealing, with other patients. Van der Walt admits one charge of attending work under the influence of alcohol on October 18, 2012.

But she denies a charge of failing to maintain professional boundaries by discussing sex and her own sex life in front of patients.

A further charge of breaching confidentiality by discussing patients’ private matters such as weight and other sensitive information is denied by the nurse.

If her fitness to practise is found to be impaired she could be struck off.

The hearing continues.
