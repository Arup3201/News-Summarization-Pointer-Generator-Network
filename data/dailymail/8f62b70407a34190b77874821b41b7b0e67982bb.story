He said: 'Men can also cry but I can return to my country happy. A great team has been born. I'm crying because we gave everything we had inside of us,' he told reporters after the game.

'We have not progressed to the semi-finals. The referee did not always whistle in the right direction and did not penalise many of Brazil's misdemeanors but we go out with our heads held high.'

Brazil's David Luiz consoled Rodriguez at the end of the match.'He congratulated me for my World Cup,' the Monaco star said.

'He told me I was a good player. The truth is that having so many superstars hugging me did make me happy. We have to raise our heads now and thank Colombia for their support.

'We are sad because we wanted to keep going and set new records. We gave everything to reach the semi-final but we have to be proud because we played a great side.'
