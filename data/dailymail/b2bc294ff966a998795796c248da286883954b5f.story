Facing prison: Handcuffed Lianne Smith leaving the court after being found guilty

Killer mother Lianne Smith today vowed to appeal after being found guilty of murdering her two children in Spain.

Her lawyer said she was in 'a bad way' after the verdicts but would fight her conviction for smothering Rebecca, five, and baby Daniel, 11 months.

Jenifer Lahoz Abos said: 'Lianne suffers from psychosis and cannot be held criminally accountable for her actions. No mother in her right mind would chose to end the lives of her children.

'She needs help. I spoke to her immediately after the conviction and she is in a very bad way. She has found the trial extremely difficult as it has brought back awful memories for her.'

Smith suffocated the children with a plastic bag in the Hotel Miramar in the seaside resort of Lloret de Mar in May 2010.

Last night at Girona Provincial Court, north-east Spain, a jury of seven men and two women unanimously found her guilty of double murder.

Today she is on suicide watch in a Spanish prison.

Smith, 45, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, is under constant supervision in a secure psychiatric hospital inside a jail called Brians 1 Penitentiary Centre near Barcelona.

She is facing up to 34 years behind bars.

Smith, a former county council children's services manager, is being watched 24 hours a day and will be assessed regularly by a prison psychiatrist.

The hospital unit can house up to 60 male and female prisoners suffering from psychiatric illnesses.

The jury rejected defence claims Smith was criminally insane, after hearing testimony from three psychiatrists during a four-day trial at Girona Provincial Court.

The jury ruled Smith was 'fully conscious of what she did and that it was wrong'.

Smith feared social services would take the children from her after her fugitive partner Martin Smith, a TV psychic, was arrested on child sex charges at their home in Barcelona.

Girona Provincial Court heard the couple, who shared a surname but were not married, made a pact that they would kill themselves if they were ever separated.

Martin Smith, 46, from North Shields, was later jailed for 16 years for repeatedly raping his stepdaughter Sarah Richardson, now 24, but hanged himself in HMP Manchester in January, believing his partner had killed his young son and daughter.

However the court heard DNA tests proved he was not in fact the father of either child.

After killing them, Smith spent the night in the hotel room alongside their lifeless bodies writing a series of notes, including one to her children which read:" ' love you very much. I wanted to give you a lovely life together. I'm very sorry.'

She failed in several suicide attempts before asking a hotel receptionist to call police to the room.

Smith had become obsessed with the idea social services would take her children from her and put them into care - which she considered a fate 'worse than death'.

Prison psychiatrist Harry Barker told the court Smith viewed the children's deaths as an 'unavoidable catastrophe'.

She suffers from an unspecified psychosis and was 'pathologically obsessed' with Martin Smith.

But prosecutor Victor Pillado Quintas told the jury her crimes were 'the most abominable, despicable, vile and horrific' imaginable.

He called on the judge to jail her for 17 years for each count of murder.

Judge Adolfo Garcia Morales will sentence her at a later date.
