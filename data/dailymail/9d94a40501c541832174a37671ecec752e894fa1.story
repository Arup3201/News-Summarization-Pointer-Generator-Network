In just two years as the head of Thomas Cook, Harriet Green has seen the company add £2billion to its value - but has now departed

She has been credited with transforming the fortunes of the UK’s oldest tour operator, Thomas Cook.

But yesterday, Harriet Green – one of the country’s leading and most outspoken businesswomen - left the firm with immediate effect after just two years in the job.

The sudden departure of the colourful 52-year-old stunned the City, wiping £360 million off the company’s value as its share price plunged.

One insider indicated that the board had grown frustrated with the ‘personality cult’ which Miss Green had cultivated.

The outspoken businesswoman made comments to the media on everything from maternity leave - 'a year is too long' - to overweight staff.

Under her stewardship she revived a firm which was on the brink, adding almost £2billion its value.

Well-known in the City for her voracious work ethic, gruelling 5am fitness regimes and for needing less sleep than Margaret Thatcher, the glamorous high flyer has been replaced by Peter Fankhauser, a 13 year Swiss veteran of the firm.

Mystery surrounds why the board was in such a hurry to get rid of its star chief executive, who is thought to have wanted another 12 months at the helm to knock the business into shape.

In a statement issued to the stockmarket Ms Green – who has not lined up another job - indicated the timing of her departure was of her own choosing and said her ‘work is complete’.

She said: ‘I have always said that I would move on to another company with fresh challenges once my work was complete. That time is now.’

But speaking at trade publication Management Today’s Inspiring Women conference last Thursday, Ms Green told a very different story.

She said the turnaround at Thomas Cook was far from complete and described it as a six year job.

‘There are many things that aren’t done,’ she said.

‘You can’t do a transformation on this sort of scale in a year or two years. I usually say it’s about six years….. We go to the city next week with our second set of results, to show if and how the company has become fitter and better, and we’re absolutely not done.’

Although the chairman insisted the decision was ‘amicable’ and ‘unanimous’, it appears to have backfired as shares fell by almost 18pc yesterday.

It is thought that the board may have become frustrated with the 'cult of personality' that outspoken Ms Green has cultivated during her time at the company

This was also driven by a warning from the company that ‘tougher market conditions’ – particularly growing problems in the eurozone – would cause its business to grow more slowly next year.  

Chairman Frank Meysman rejected reports that Ms Green had been pushed out.

Ms Green, who was paid £2.86million last year, will receive a pay-off of six months’ salary, worth £340,000, as well as share awards and long term bonuses built up during her time in charge.

Mr Meysman said she was leaving ahead of the three years she had initially targeted because she had done such an ‘excellent job’ in turning the company around.

Miss Green has become a darling of the City and a role model for women in business after leading a dramatic revival of Thomas Cook, which is used by 6.5million British holidaymakers a year and traces its history back to 1841.

Her success has also gained the attention of the Prime Minister, with David Cameron appointing her to his inner circle of top business advisers.

As one of the few female bosses of big companies, Ms Green was voted Veuve Clicquot businesswoman of the year in May.

Her departure means there are just twelve women running FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 firms.

Standing just 5 foot 3 tall, Ms Green has shown a ruthless streak, cutting costs and adapting the business to cater for the surge in people booking their holidays online, rather than by visiting a travel agent.

Thomas Cook still specialises in all inclusive package holidays, but Ms Green has sought to take the business upmarket.

The strategy has been painful, with the firm cutting 2,500 jobs and closing more than 300 high street stores in a bid to cut costs and modernise.

But it has also been successful.

The share price has soared from 14p when Ms Green took the helm in July 2012 to 139.9p – with a market value of just over £2billion on Tuesday night, before yesterday’s announcement.

Miss Green, the former boss of electronics components distributor Premier Farnell, is not lacking in confidence.

Despite having no experience in the travel industry she famously cold called the chairman of the struggling tour operator Frank Meysman, telling him she was the right person to turn the business around.

At the time it was on its knees, suffering from a general fall in tourism numbers as a result of the global recession and unrest in the Middle East hitting package holidays in Egypt and Tunisia.

Miss Green is equally focussed about her love life– she claims to have taken just seven seconds to choose her businessman husband Graham when she met him in New York.

She has two step children from her husband’s first marriage, but says she does not see her family from Monday to Thursday.

Instead she is said to spend most of her working week in the five star Brown’s Hotel in London’s Mayfair, before heading to the family home in Oxford at the weekends.

A self professed lover of designer labels and diamonds, Ms Green is also a fitness fanatic and enjoys early 5.30am gym sessions with her former marine and war veteran personal trainer.

She is a devotee of Hatha Yoga and claims to need just four hours sleep a night, declaring the death of her father when she was just 14 persuaded her to make the most of every day.

'Sleep is overrated': The life of Harriet Green

Harriet Green has previously boasted of getting just three and a half hours of sleep a night, and hits the gym for an hour a day with an ex-Marine

At the end of 2011, Thomas Cook was a company at its lowest ebb. 

Falling tourism numbers had seen nearly three quarters of the firm's value disappear in just 12 months, while it had just been named as Britain's Least Admired Company.

In November the board had to go to banks, begging bowl in hand, to ask for £200million to prop itself up. 

It was around that time that chairman Frank Meysman got a cold-call from Harriet Green.

Never one to doubt her own abilities, Ms Green told him simply that she was the person to turn Thomas Cook's ailing fortunes around. The following summer, she was appointed as CEO.

That direct, no-nonsense pitch was typical of Ms Green's style. Under her leadership, the firm has cut 2,500 staff, closed 300 stores, but managed to add £2billion to its value.

Despite standing at just 5ft 3in tall, Ms Green has managed to carve out a career in the boisterous, testosterone-driven world of the modern global CEO.

She once quipped that 'sleep is overrated' and reportedly gets just three and a half hours of shut-eye each night, less than former Prime Minister Margret Thatcher.

Her daily routine sees her up at 3.3am each morning to answer emails from staff of all ranks as part of her Ask Harriet hour.

She told Management Today: 'I reply to every email within 24 hours and usually a lot faster.

'When people realised that, it sent the most symbolic ripple through the organisation. "She replies to us, and quickly, so we've got to keep moving!"

By 5am she is usually in the gym, pushing herself through a gruelling routine alongside her personal trainer - a former Marine who served in Afghanistan.

Business may keep her occupied for the remainder of the day, but she still finds time to be a prolific tweeter and an avid reader, picking up everything from Sigmund Freud to Donna Tartt.

Born in 1961 in Shipton, Gloucestershire, Ms Green is the eldest of three children and attended state school Westwood's Grammar.

She was a fan of amateur dramatics and history at school, but the defining moment of her younger years came when her father died of a brain tumour when she was just 14. 

She says the trauma taught her that 's*** happens' and was determined to make the most of every moment from then on. 

She went on to King's College, London, where she graduated with a BA in Medieval Literature in 1983, and studied at the London School of Economics.

She began her career working for a magazine, Working Women, before making the move into business herself.

Since then Ms Green has lived and worked on four continents and even learnt Mandarin for one job, giving a speech to 2,000 people in Shanghai using her new language.

While there she also began practicing yoga, and at one time had a miniature Zen Buddhist garden arranged on her desk.

But a touchy-feely new-ager she is not. Outspoken in her opinions, she has branded a year of maternity leave as 'too long' and rubbished the idea of quotas to attract more women to the boardroom.

It is perhaps that attitude that saw her depart from Thomas Cook yesterday, a year ahead of schedule. But it is an attitude she is unlikely to change any time soon.
