The number of bank robberies has fallen more than 90 per cent in the past two decades - as would-be raiders are deterred by increasingly sophisticated security measures.

Figures gathered by the British Bankers’ Association show there were just 66 bank robberies in 2011 compared with 847 in 1992.

The crime has long captured the imaginations of cinema-goers and television viewers, featuring in Western movies such as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, while offenders regularly kept Jack Regan busy in TV crime drama The Sweeney.

Real-life bank robbers in the UK have included ‘Mad’ Frankie Fraser, now aged 90 and still living on his notoriety writing books and endorsing a feature film about his crimes.

Fraser robbed banks in the 1950s before going on to be an associate of the Richardson Gang, rivals of the Krays, in the 1960s.

However, the most recent large-scale bank robbery was almost 10 years ago when £26 million was stolen from the Northern Bank, Belfast, in 2004, and incidents have continued to fall.

Banking chiefs say they hope to consign the crime to the past.

Anthony Browne, British Bankers’ Association chief executive, said: ‘Banks will continue to work closely with each other, post offices and the police to make such raids a thing of the past.’

Improvements in bank security over the last two decades include extensive CCTV cameras, screens that protect staff and a specialist fog used to disperse criminals.

More sophisticated equipment include devices that explode when an unauthorised person enters the room, covering the offender with smoke laced with artificial DNA that coats the skin and clothing.

Bank staff, along with those at other vulnerable businesses such as post offices, are better-prepared as a result of greater co-operation with police, the association said.

Bank robberies have also fallen in the United States but at a slower rate than the UK. In 2011, there were 5,000 bank robberies in the country, with $30 million stolen and 100 people killed or injured.

In 2003, 7,465 American banks were robbed, with $72m stolen.
