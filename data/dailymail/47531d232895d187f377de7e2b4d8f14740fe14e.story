If you ever wanted proof that pre-season form should not be taken too seriously, the 24 hours between Arsenal’s spectacular win and uninspiring defeat at the Emirates had it.

Fielding a side far from their best starting XI, Arsenal tore apart Portuguese champions Benfica 5-1 on Saturday afternoon, suggesting Arsene Wenger’s side could finally rid themselves of any squad depth concerns.

Then, a tame 1-0 defeat to Monaco on Sunday brought the Gunners right back down to earth, despite Wenger selecting first team stars.

Of course, the players won’t take it to heart. Pre-season has one priority; fitness.

Winning games is a bonus, but is there a relationship between form in July and form in the next 10 months?

Manchester United and Southampton fans will hope so. Both have won all their pre-season games so far, despite a new leader and a desperate need for rebuilding at both clubs.

Here are the facts. Typically, the Premier League champions rarely lose more than two of their pre-season games, but in recent years the Manchester clubs have not always shown a sign of things to come in the summer months.

Last season, Man City lost four of their eight pre-season fixtures, overcome by Bayern Munich, Arsenal, and South African outfits SuperSport United and AmaZulu. Manuel Pellegrini’s side went on to take the league title by two points.

Similarly, in 2010, neighbours United lost three of their seven warm-ups, against Kansas City Wizards, Guadalajara and Juventus. Sir Alex Ferguson didn't mind too much, and they wrapped up their 19th title with a game to spare.

Likewise, United’s treble season in 1998-99 started with defeats at Birmingham City and Aberdeen. As you’d expect, Fergie didn't take the defeats to heart.

There’s also a warning sign for the fans of relegation candidates. Saints, torn apart by the departure of Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers and Luke Shaw, have ignored talks of a crisis under Ronald Koeman and performed on the pitch, while newly promoted Leicester are unbeaten in their four pre-season games with three wins. Encouraging? Don’t read too much into it.

In recent years, summer promise has more often than not led to tears come May. Cardiff lost just once in pre-season last term but failed to avoid the drop, while QPR were unbeaten in their seven warm-up matches in 2012 before going down.

In 2011-12, the relegated teams enjoyed fine pre-season form - Bolton won six of their eight games, while Blackburn and Wolves each lost just one of their six fixtures. All three went through the trap door and have failed to emerge since.

Fresh from signing the likes of Pablo Barrera and Frederic Piquionne in the summer of 2010, West Ham won six of their seven, beating Monchengladbach, Deportivo and Panathinaikos. Sadly, it took them until late February to even win six Premier League games. You guessed it, Avram Grant’s side went down, alongside Alex McLeish’s Birmingham, who lost only one of seven in pre-season.

Shock friendly results can also be misleading. You’ll struggle to find a Newcastle fan left unaffected by the 6-1 defeat to Leyton Orient just two months after dropping out of the Premier League in 2009. 

Despite Alan Smith, Obafemi Martins, Tim Krul, Joey Barton and Luis Enrique all playing, spirit seemed at an all-time low. They went on to lose just four games in the Championship, and won the division with 102 points under Chris Hughton.

Players, too, can show promise in July and flop when points are on the line.

Aston Villa’s Swedish forward Marcus Allback scored seven goals, including two hat-tricks, before the 2003-04 season, but went on to score just one more in 15 games. Similarly, in 2004, Mateja Kezman took his goalscoring form from PSV to Chelsea for pre-season, scoring four in three games, but only managed another four in the Premier League before leaving for Atletico Madrid.

Yaya Sanogo, Roberto Soldado, Ashley Young and Stevan Jovetic will hope to take their impressive pre-season form into the competitive season after struggling in the Premier League last term.

Of course, weak squads, fitness and motivational levels must all be taken into account. No matter how many sponsored international super friendly tournaments are created, the thrill of competitive action is difficult to replicate.

Pre-season does serve a purpose for fans. It is a time for optimism, a period where all fans get gee themselves up for the new campaign and dream of what is to come.

But don’t take it too seriously. When there are points on the line, everything changes.
