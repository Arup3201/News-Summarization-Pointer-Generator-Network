Prime Minister Tony Abbott has started using his new armoured BMW as his regular mode of transportation, treating himself to the $500,000 luxury vehicle after a stressful few months in government.

The car is one of six the Federal government has bought under the heightened terrorism alert placed on the nation by Mr Abbott.

The $6.3 million contract for the limousines has already been used at the G20 summit in Brisbane in November, and the Prime Minister has been spotted using the vehicle for a visit to a family farm just outside Canberra on Wednesday.

Tony Abbott's $500,000 armoured BMW was in action on Wednesday as the Prime Minister visited a farm

The Prime Minister was accompanied by Treasurer Joe Hockey and Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce on the visit to the Hodgkinson family at the Vale View Farm in Murrumbateman.

The Prime Minister announced while at the farm that foreign investment of more than $15 million in Australian land would come under closer scrutiny from March this year. 

The 7 Series High Security BMW vehicle was on show as it chauffeured Mr Abbott from Canberra to Vale View Farm on Wednesday. 

The BMW is bombproof and has been designed to withstand AK47 bullets, replacing the fleet of Holden VIP limos used by the Prime Minister previously. 

The vehicle is built to combat street crime with blunt objects and handguns up to a calibre of .44 Magnum, organised crime incidents which commonly involves the use of the AK-47 and attacks with explosive devices and armour-piercing weapons. 

The custom made security cars offer three levels of safety depending on the individual requirements designed to withstand a range of risk scenarios.

The use of armoured cars for high-profile leaders is a widespread practice around the world.

Although most details of U.S. President Obama’s car are classified for security reasons, the details that have been released are pretty impressive features despite the vehicle being criticised for poor maneuverability.

Referred to as 'The Beast' by the Secret Service, the heavily-armoured vehicle has special night vision system in a secret location and special loops that replace the stock door handle for agents to hold on to when running alongside the car.

The Cadillac DTS is also sealed against biochemical attacks, carries an oxygen supply and there is even a blood bank of the president's blood type kept in the trunk.

British prime minister David Cameron’s jaguar is also equipped with an oxygen supply to protect from chemical and biological attacks and is understood to be capable of withstanding the blasts of the equivalent to 15 kg of TNT and a variety of other armour-piercing weapons.

The vehicle also features a 13 mm explosive resistant steel plate underneath the body, titanium- and Kevlar-lined cabins, armoured windows with bulletproof polycarbonate toughened glass, run flat-tyres and 'gun ports' to enable bodyguards to return fire at any attackers.

The car also boasts state-of-the-art communication and conferencing systems, high definition televisions, night vision, as well as adjustable, heated and cooled rear massage seats, and a surround-sound system.

While Mr Abbott's BMW limo, which retails for $525,000,  includes two 9.2 inch colour screens.
