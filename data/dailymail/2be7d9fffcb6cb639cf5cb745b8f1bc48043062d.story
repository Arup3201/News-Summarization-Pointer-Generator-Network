Astonishingly video of a blind Border Collie playing fetch and manoeuvring at top speeds around her farm is baffling experts over what is only being described by her owners as a kind of super power.

Darting around her home in Clay County, Indiana, slipping beneath fences and slowing to a stop before parked vehicles, her owners say they have no explanation for it with the dog having never once seen any of the objects she comes in contact with.

Having her eyes surgically removed when a puppy the dog has zero chance of sight prompting Chica's owners to compare her uncanny ability to a 'radar.'

Mystery: Chica, a Border Collie whose eyes were removed when a puppy, has shown a mysterious super power of being able to play fetch and manoeuvre her home's farmland

Your move: With the dog's favourite past time being a game of fetch, Chica is seen after triumphantly rolling a basketball back to her owner and waiting for its next move

'I don’t understand it at all. She runs every place she goes,' Chica's owner Martha Knox told WTHI. 'It’s almost like she has radar.'

Mutually stumped, the owners say, are experts at Purdue University who have taken a look at her as well.

Demonstrating Chica’s skill and favourite past time, a basketball is tossed into the yard as the dog patiently stays seated waiting her owner’s command.

Released with a 'go get it!' she is seen sprinting in its direction, easily catching up before shuffling the ball side-to-side with her snout to bring it back to her owner.

Go get it! Chica's owners will throw the basketball before giving the dog a delayed command to bring it back to them, shuffling it from side-to-side with her snout

Radar: Among her other talents is navigating their Indiana farm, slipping beneath fences as seen and while racing around the property never hitting any objects

'Good girl!' Mrs Knox rewards the dog whose tail waves in celebration.

She is also seen eagerly jumping into her owner's pickup truck when called for a ride.

With no explanation for her ability given, her owners reason that their dog simply 'sees with her heart.'
