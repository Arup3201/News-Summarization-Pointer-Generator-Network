A girl of seven has been saved by a kidney transplant from her 60-year-old grandmother – the biggest ever age gap for a donation in the UK.

Eva Dowling was diagnosed with a rare and life-threatening illness at three months old.

Her condition, atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome, causes clots to  block blood vessels and can lead to  kidney failure. Unable to eat or drink and needing frequent blood transfusions, Eva had to be fed through a tube in her stomach and spent three days a week in hospital.

Eva Dowling, seven, has undergone a life-saving kidney transplant, thanks to her grandmother Eileen Smith-Jones, 60, in what experts believe is the biggest age gap between donor and recipient in the country

Doctors feared she would never be able
 to have a kidney transplant because of the blood transfusions, which 
drastically increased the chance her body would reject a donated organ. 
But when her grandmother Eileen Smith-Jones was found to be a perfect 
match, Eva’s life was transformed.

‘I
 can survive quite nicely with one kidney and the difference in Eva is 
incredible,’ Mrs Smith-Jones said.  ‘She is livelier, happier and able 
to  do things she has never done before. We are so happy.’

Now
 Eva, who calls her new kidney ‘Miss Kitty’, can enjoy her food and says
 she loves chocolate and porridge. She needs a check up just once a 
fortnight, meaning she can attend school full-time for the first time.

Eva can eat, drink, swim and go to school full-time for the first time in her life after the life-saving operation at Bristol Children's Hospital, pictured. She was diagnosed with the rare and life-threatening kidney disease atypical HUS when she was just three months old

Mrs
 Smith-Jones has also recovered well after the operation. ‘Unfortunately
 giving a kidney didn’t make me any lighter,’ she said. ‘But my cravings
 for chocolate and red wine  have gone.’

Eva’s mother Nicola Dowling, 34, said: ‘How can you ever thank someone for what she did?

‘It has made the world of  difference to Eva and the whole family. She can now live a  normal life.’

A
 spokesman for the Human Tissue Authority said an age gap of this size 
between donor and recipient was very rare. There are only a few cases of
 grandparents donating to their grandchildren each year

Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is a very rare, life-threatening, progressive disease.

The disease, which affects both children and adults, causes the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body.

The clots pose a danger, potentially causing stroke, heart attack, kidney failure and death.

Between
 33 and 40 per cent of patients diagnosed with the condition will 
develop end-stage renal disease, leading to permanent renal damage.

Those suffering atypical HUS will suffer recurring bouts of the disease throughout their lives.

The syndrome is not well understood, but it thought to be linked to an irregularity in several genes.

However in some cases the disease can appear out of nowhere.

In the U.S. the number of cases of Atypical HUS is thought to be around 300 a year.

In
 most cases a patient with atypical HUS will suffer fatigue, become 
irritable and lethargic to a point where they need to be admitted to 
hospital.

There are three 
main causes of atypical HUS, pregnancy induced cases of the disease are 
the most common external source, while some cancers, HIV and other rare 
pneumonia diseases are also known triggers.

A second major cause is familial or genetic cases.

There is no standard treatment, because each case differs.

Children with the disease often develop various complications, so treatment is tailored.
