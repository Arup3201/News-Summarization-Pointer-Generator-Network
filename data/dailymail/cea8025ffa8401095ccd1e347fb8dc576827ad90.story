 St Andrews in Scotland.

'Mollie
 was very much the focal point for all of us and losing her so suddenly 
in these circumstances has left us deeply shocked and saddened,' they 
said.

'She will be remembered for her lovely smile, her kind and generous ways and her great sense of humour.

'She
 was a friend to so many people and we are very grateful for the huge 
number of tributes and messages we have received from people who knew 
her.'
