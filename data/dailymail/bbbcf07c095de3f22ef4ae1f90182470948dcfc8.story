An overweight admin assistant has lost five stone after a stranger gave up their seat on the tube for her thinking her was pregnant.

Eva Minczuk, 29, from Romford, Essex, who was not with child, was mortified when the man offered up his seat.

Eva, who weighed 14st 7lb at the time, felt far too embarrassed to admit otherwise as she sat down and tried not to cry.

But it was the push she needed to lose the weight and Eva has now lost five stone and is a svelte size eight.

She said: 'When the man stood up to offer me his seat I was too embarrassed to say anything so just sat down. I could feel the tears stinging my eyes.

'But after years of putting on weight I finally decided to do something about it.

'Last year on my holiday to Turkey I finally felt confident enough to wear a bikini for the first time ever - I must have bought seven new bikinis.

'I was a size 16 before, but now I am so much more confident. Before on holiday I would hide away but now I'm more than happy to show off my new figure.

Eva, who now weighs in at 9st 7lbs, had always been a big child, but assumed it was her natural body shape and she would never be thin.

Her weight soared when she met her first fiance, but he dumped her when she reached a size 16 - claiming she was too big.

She said: 'I was devastated when he dumped me, and because I was upset I ate for comfort and kept putting weight on.

'I was young then - I was only 20 - and didn't realise that a man who broke up with me for such a shallow reason wasn't the right man for me.

'Being big just became who I was and I just assumed that it would never be possible for me to be anything different.

She signed up to the Cambridge Weight Plan, replacing food with soups, milkshakes and porridge

'But when the man on the tube assumed I was pregnant I knew something had to change.

'No-one I knew would ever have told me that I was big. It took this man's reaction to make me realise that I wasn't a healthy size any more.'

Eva signed up to the Cambridge Weight Plan, replacing food with soups, milkshakes and porridge.

She lost just under a stone a month for six months on the plan.

Eva said: 'I met my husband, Thomas, in 2009 and he didn't care about my size.

'When I told him about the plan he was extremely supportive and just wanted me to do whatever made me happy.

'Now we joke that he got two women in one - the old me and the new, thin me.'

Her first fiance dumped her due to her size when she was just 20, but Eva has found love again
