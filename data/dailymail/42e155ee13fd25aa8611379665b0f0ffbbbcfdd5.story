You might hope for a shed at the bottom of your garden. Perhaps even a barn, if the estate is especially impressive.

But a property currently on sale on Scotland's east coast goes one better. For your  £750,000, you will get not only a converted 200-year-old fishing station, a bungalow and several hectares of land, but also the ruin of a castle thought once to have been inhabited by a notorious 15th-century cannibal.

The Aberdeenshire coastal location complete with a beautifully renovated bungalow is in stark contrast to the grisly history of Kaim of Mathers Castle which was once home to 5th century Laird James Barclay.

Perched precariously on the cliff edge the ruins are included in the three hectares of land that comes with the main property.

The 15th century laird Barclay was accused of eating the local sheriff and was banished by the king to spend the rest of his life at Kaim of Mathers 'poised between the land and sea on a cliff top near St Cyrus'

According to local legend the cannibal laird often complained to King James I of Scotland about the sheriff who was detested by local landowners.

It is said one day the king told him to 'go and make soup of the sheriff' and 'sup' him - a comment Barcley took quite literally.

According to 'Portrait of a Parish' by Duncan Fraser, Barcley and other lairds from the area tricked the sheriff into a day's hunting before tipping him into a boiling cauldron.

One by one each lord 'had a sup of the broth'.

When the King found out he denied any involvement in the brutal killing and denounced those who took part.

He swore an oath that Barclay 'would get no peace to live neither on land nor sea for the rest of his life'.

The cannibal laird spent the rest of his life at Kaim of Mathers 'poised between the land and sea on a cliff top near St Cyrus'.

Built into a hollow at the top of the cliffs, Rock Hall has been transformed from a working fishing station with skipper's quarters, net store, two crewmen's bothies and a vaulted ice house into one large five-bedroom family home

The buyers brochure states: 'Rock Hall Fishing Station and Bungalow was bought as a ruin in 1998, it was comprehensively restored and turned into a family home by current owners Andrew and Annie Hamilton. Dating from around the late 18th century, Rock Hall was run as a salmon fishing station for around 200 years'

The stunning ruin with the ghoulish history comes with a historic fishing station which has been converted into a family home over nine levels and a three bedroom bungalow. The properties are just one mile from St Cyrus beach. Agents Strut and Parker said the two properties can be sold as one lot on separately

Despite his gruesome reputation Laird Bracley isn't Scotland's most prolific cannibal.

Alexander 'Sawney' Bean - the semi-mythical head of a 48-member Scottish clan in the 16th Century - is said to have killed and eaten more than 1,000 people.

The property also comes complete with a three bedroom bungalow; the properties are just one mile from St Cyrus Beach and according to the agents selling them, Strut and Parker, the properties can be sold as one lot or purchased separately

Originally from East Lothian Alexander 'Sawney' Bean and his partner spent 25 years secretly living in a coast cave near Girvan.

Is is said the couple had eight sons, six daughters, eighteen grandsons and fourteen granddaughters.

Eventually the cannibal clan was discovered following a manhunt with a team of 400 men and several bloodhounds.

When the cave was discovered it was scattered with the remains of their many victims.
