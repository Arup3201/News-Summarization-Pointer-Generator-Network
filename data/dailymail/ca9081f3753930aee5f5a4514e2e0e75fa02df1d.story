A driver who accidentally killed his own step-sister during an illegal road race has been jailed for seven years.

Aaron Bridgeman smashed into his step-sister Vicky, 40, after she was thrown off a motorbike she was riding and landed in the path of his car. 

Bridgeman, 35, who does not have a driving licence, could not stop his Peugeot in time and ran his step-sister over before she was hit by another car.

Biker Jason Szalkowski, who also does not have a licence, was thrown from the motorcycle and left with brain damage after hitting floodwater on the lane near Caerphilly, south Wales.

Bridgeman then fled the scene because he did not want to be caught driving a borrowed car without insurance.

He pleaded guilty to driving without a licence and insurance, to fleeing the scene of a crime and of failing to report an accident.

Bridgeman, from Caerphilly, was today jailed for seven years and banned from driving for six years.

Sentencing him at Newport Crown Court, judge Daniel Willliams said: 'You never passed a driving test but that did not stop you from driving almost every day.

'You thought that the rules of the road did not apply to you. Your driving was terribly dangerous.

'Driving conditions that day were terribly hazardous but you knew that would make the race even better and you used that narrow lane as a race track.

'You were driving at a grossly excessive speed, driving the car at its limit to keep up with the motorbike.

'You drove into your sister - driving so close to the bike it could not be avoided.

'You took a cursory look at your sister and Mr Szalkowski and calmy drove off.' 

At a previous hearing, the court heard that Bridgeman was 'right behind' the motorcycle when his step-sister fell into the road. 

Prosecutor Ieuan Bennett said: 'Bridgeman simply wasn't able to avoid his own step-sister as she went over the front of his car.'

Bridgeman briefly stopped his car before fleeing the scene of the accident in December 2013, the court was told.

Ms Bridgeman was riding on the back of Jason Szalkowski's (pictured) motorbike when it hit a puddle, flinging her off the bike and into the road

Mr Bennett added: 'He looked briefly at Jason Szalkowski, who he knew well, and at the body of his own step-sister.

'He then got promptly back into his car and drove off.'

Ms Bridgeman was run over by another car as she lay in the road. The driver thought he had hit a sheep because of her white jumper.

Mr Bennett said it was 'impossible' to say which impact killed Ms Bridgeman - also known as Claire - but that she died as a result of the race. 

Mr Szalkowski could have faced prosecution but it was decided it was 'not in the public interest' because he was so seriously injured.
