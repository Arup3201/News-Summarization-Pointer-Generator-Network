Famously dubbed 'showbusiness for ugly people', the world of politics hasn't always delivered when it comes to looking good.

But one MP who certainly does get pulses pounding is Swedish health minister Gabriel Wikström, 29, who has been inundated with romantic messages after a photo posted by a Turkish fan went viral.

Nicknamed 'the handsome minister' by his growing legion of fans, Wikström, a Social Democrat who holds the position of Public Health Minister, says he is 'honoured' by all the attention.

Speaking to English language Swedish daily newspaper, The Local, he said: 'I can’t feel anything but honoured and glad. And a little bit surprised, I must admit.'

Wikström's route to social media stardom began last Sunday, when a Turkish fan posted a photo with a caption that read: 'The Handsome Minister'.

Within days, the photo had gone viral and the politician found himself being bombarded with messages from his growing number of Turkish fans, as well as others from across Europe.

Clearly determined to capitalise on his growing fame, Wikström added: 'Hopefully I can be a role model and inspire young people in Turkey to get involved in politics.'

Wikström, who is currently attending a health summit in the Danish capital Copenhagen, isn't the only Scandinavian politician to win plaudits for his looks.

Denmark's prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, 47, is famous for her glamorous blonde looks, while her 39-year-old agriculture minister, Dan Jørgensen, has also proved a hit with the ladies.

Arguably the most popular of all though, other than Wikström himself, is 35-year-old Hans Linde of Sweden's Left Party, who is as famous for his good looks as he is for his politics.

And while Denmark and Sweden have plenty of good-looking ministers to choose from, the UK has more than one of its own.

Although Sexy MP, a website dedicated to Parliament's great and good-looking, has now shut down, it regularly put Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, 39, at the top of its looks list while running.

MPs snapping at Mr Goldsmith's heels include Labour's shadow education and business secretaries, Tristram Hunt, 40, and Chuka Umunna, 36,

Other politicians to set pulses racing, both past and present, include Barack Obama, French prime minister Manuel Valls and Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto. 

Handsome though Gabriel Wikström undoubtedly is, he's by no means the only politician to set pulses racing.

From the UK's dapper environmentalist Zac Goldsmith to suave Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto, feast your eyes on the political hotshots winning plaudits for their looks as well as their policies.
