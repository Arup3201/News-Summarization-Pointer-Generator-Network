Daniel Sturridge could make a shock return to action for Liverpool in their semi-final showdown at Chelsea on Tuesday night.

Sturridge is now back in full training after months of injury frustration, and the former Blues striker is in line to face his old club.

He has not played for the Reds since August and his return will be much welcomed, with Liverpool struggling in front of goal this term.

Sturridge was in the stands for Liverpool's first leg against Chelsea at Anfield. The game ended in a 1-1 draw

'He had his training session with the team yesterday, he trained very well,' said Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers of his striker, who scored 24 times last season.

'That was as comfortable as he has looked. I thought he looked back to normal. 'We will see how he feels today, but if he is not ready for tomorrow we won't risk it.'

'He has been out a long time and we need to make sure that he is ready and feels ready.'
