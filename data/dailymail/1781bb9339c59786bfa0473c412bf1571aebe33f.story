There can't be many days in the year when pedestrians, cyclists - and skateboarders - reign supreme on some of Israel's busiest roads.

In a scene which could have come straight from a movie, there isn't a car in sight as families, teenagers and Rabbis freely roam the empty streets.

On any other day, you might expect the highways in and around Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to be teeming with traffic, choking fumes rising above the cityscape.

But thanks to the holiest Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur the streets are empty and the air is clear, allowing many to enjoy a rare car-free day.

Yom Kippur - or Day of Atonement - is the holiest of Jewish holidays, when observant Jews atone for sins of the last year.

Israel came to a standstill for 24 hours during the holiday, in which Jews fast and Israelis are prohibited from driving their cars.

As these incredible pictures show, youths on skateboards and bikes, joggers - and even Orthodox Jewish men - take to the tarmac making some of Israel's busiest cities look like ghost towns.

Meanwhile, headstones at a Muslim and a Christian cemetery were desecrated by unknown assailants in Jaffa today, an Israeli website said.

Pictures of one gravestone with the words 'death to Arabs' spray painted
 in Hebrew and the words 'Price tag', a slogan used by militant Jewish 
West Bank settlers and their supporters, on another.

A third photograph showed a broken tombstone but none of the photographs could be independently verified due to the fast day's traditional travel limitations.

The 'price-taggers' have vowed to avenge any move by Israel to uproot settlement outposts built in the occupied West Bank without Israeli government permission and have torched mosques and vandalised both Israeli and Palestinian property.

Police and Jewish Israeli officials were not available for comment during the Yom Kippur fast day and a local Muslim community leader in Jaffa quoted in the article did not reply when contacted.

Jaffa is the ancient part of Tel Aviv which has a mixed Arab and Jewish population.

On Monday, a mosque in a Bedouin village in northern Israel was set on fire and graffiti sprayed on its walls in an attack authorities have blamed on hard-line Jewish settlers.

The torching drew broad condemnation from top Israeli leaders and President Shimon Peres and the country's chief rabbis also visited the scene to calm tensions.

In 2005 a Jewish couple was charged for throwing a pig's head into a Tel Aviv mosque in an attempt to derail Israel's then pullout from the Gaza Strip which went ahead in August of that year.

In 2008 riots erupted in the coastal city of Acre in northern Israel when Jews accosted an Arab man who drove his car into a predominantly Jewish neighborhood during Yom Kippur when all traffic halts and the country shuts down for 24 hours.
