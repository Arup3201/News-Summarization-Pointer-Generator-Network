A woman who lost part of her left leg in the Boston Marathon bombing fears she will not be able to afford her prosthetic limbs after the charity set up to help victims announced it was winding down.

Heather Abbott was caught in the explosion when two pressure bombs exploded near the finish line in April 2013, killing three and injuring more than 260.

But while the 40-year-old said she was incredibly grateful to the One Fund Boston charity which has helped her afford four different prosthetic legs, she fears for the future after the charity announced it will stop its operations.

Boston Marathon bombing survivor Heather Abbott fears she will not be able to afford prosthetic limbs after the One Fund Boston charity shut down its website and said it will stop taking donations after New Years Eve

The 40-year-old from Newport, Rhode Island, lost part of her left leg when two pressure bombs exploded near the finish line in April 2013. She currently has four prosthetic limbs, but she expects her health insurance to cover one new one, every three to five years

'I can't thank the donors enough for all of their support and generosity,' she said, but the defence company worker added that she knows the costly appendages will require regular upkeep and replacement for the rest of her life.

With the help of One Fund Boston helped she has been able to afford four different prosthetic legs - one for daily use, a waterproof one, a running leg and another for wearing high heels.

But while people rarely notice her current range of prosthetic limbs, even if she's out in sandals, she expects her health insurance to cover one new leg, which can run from $20,000 to $100,000, every three to five years.

It's also likely that it won't cover her specialized running, swimming or high heel legs. 

It also appears unlikely that it will pay for other costs such as adjusting the fit of the prosthesis as her stump atrophies and changes over time.  

Abbott, from who now works part-time, said she hopes she'll make up the difference by wisely investing the money she's been given, a plan that includes the construction of her own home in Newport, Rhode Island. 

Since its foundation shortly after the bombing, the charity has distributed nearly $80 million in donations to victims and their families.

More than 200,000 individuals, corporations and charities in over 60 countries donated to the fund, according to its executive director Lori van Dam. 

This allowed them to give gave around $2.3 million to each of the families that lost a relative when the two pressure bombs exploded near the finish line in April 2013. 

The One Fund has distributed $80 million in donations to victims and their families. Any money remaining after paying the fund's administrative costs will go to the One Fund Center, which will provide care for brain injury victims and others with mental health issues

Abbott fears for other victims like Rebekah DiMartino who did not qualify for additional One Fund money because her amputation came so late. But she said she hopes she'll make up the difference by wisely investing the money she's been given  

Those like Abbott who lost limbs or suffered other serious injuries received anywhere from $421,000 to $3.3 million, depending on the extent of their wounds.  

Others who were hospitalized but suffered less serious injuries received between $150,000 and about $1 million, while victims treated as outpatients and not hospitalized received between $12,500 and $20,500.

Van Dam said any remaining money will go towards the fund's administrative costs and the One Fund Center.

Launched in September, it will provide victims care for those with a traumatic brain injury, persistent hearing problems and mental health issues like post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety.

It was jointly founded by the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary.

However, Abbott fears for marathon survivors who have not received any money from the fund, but who may well need it in the future  

'I can only imagine how other amputees feel who don't have a One Fund,' she said.

Among those victims is Texan Rebekah DiMartino, who finally had her left leg amputated last month after 17 operations to save it.

Like some other amputees, she did not qualify for additional One Fund money because her amputation came so late.

'It's a little scary because being a recent amputee I was not entitled to the sums that they received,' she told the Associated Press, referring to other survivors who lost limbs in the attacks.

'However, I am more than grateful for what I did get and know that everything else will work out,' DiMartino added. 

While she expects her insurance will cover some of the costs for her prosthesis when it's ready, she said that she will have to pay the remainder out of her own pocket. 

Like Abbott she said she had not problem with the fund which was conceived by current Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick and then-Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in the days after the attack.  

'When it comes to injuries sustained from a bombing, there's really no way to place a price or payout for a lifetime of treatment,' she said. 

'The One Fund did as good of a job that they could have done with payouts with not knowing everyone's path for healing and progression.'

The prime suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, will face trial in January after being indicted with numerous charges in relation to the bombings.

He has pleaded not guilty, but faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted.

His older brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a shootout with police days after the two pressure cooker bombs killed three people and injured more than 260 others.
