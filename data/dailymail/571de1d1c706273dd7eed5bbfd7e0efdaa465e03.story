As many Australians struggle to break into the housing market, it appears many of our decision-makers have no such problem, with a new report revealing some own multiple properties, including National Party Senator Barry O'Sullivan, who tops the list of property owners with no less than 50 to his name.

New data shows house prices have again surged in the major capitals but the affordability crisis seems to had no impact on our political heavyweights. Another National Party member, David Gillespie, has 17 property holdings registered to his name.

There are the usual suspects.

Palmer United Party founder and billionaire Clive Palmer has at least 13 registered to his name but his mortgage register remains unclear.

Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Senator Nick Xenophon, the long-standing South Australian Independent both have 8 properties each.

Among the lesser-known of the politicians to enjoy a bounty of property is Country Liberal Party representative Natasha Griggs, who is the Member for Solomon in the Northern Territory, who was first elected to parliament in 2010.

The Propertied Federal Political Class report by property authors Lindsay David, Paul Egan and Phillip Soos shows that the top 20 members of parliament own a whopping 191 properties between them.

The report authors say on Australianboomtobust.com 'the real total is probably higher considering well-off politicians are likely to purchase real estate in prime suburban and coastal areas above the median'.

Lindsay David says the public should no be asking questions like 'are the property holdings of our federal politicians influencing policy?'

The join property worth of the 150 members of the House of Representatives is more than $190million.

Collectively senators' properties account for $107million.

The Liberal Party dominates the top ten, with 4 members, the ALP has just one representative - Allanah McTiernan - the Member for Perth.

Only 13 (6 per cent) of those in federal parliament do not own any property.
