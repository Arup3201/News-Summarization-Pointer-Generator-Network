A Canadian woman who purchased a $1million house has discovered it is a 5,000sq ft mice nest.

Carrie Forsythe had to have all of the insulation ripped out of the Winnipeg, Manitoba home she took possession of in September, after discovering the severe infestation.

Forsythe is considering suing the previous owner to recover the costs of taking the house to pieces to clear out the mice, expected to reach tens of thousands of dollars.

Co-tenants: Carrie Forsythe took possesion of her south Winnipeg home and found she was not the only occupant

Worth the price? Canadian Forsythe paid $1million for the house but did not know about the mice problem

Decisions: Forsythe may sue the previous owner who did not inform her about the problem, although he claims he did not know

The nest was discovered after she began renovating the house by opening up the walls.Â 

'All you see is just feces and urine, just puddles and piles,' Forsythe told CBC News. 'The whole vapour barrier is just filled with this nest.'

Every piece of insulation has been removed so the house can be thoroughly disinfected - and after re-insulation the vapour barrier and drywall need to be replaced.

'Now I have a shell, which I love, and it will be clean. But someone's got to help me,' she continued.

A pest control expert declared the infestation the worst he had ever seen - but Forsythe did not notice anything wrong before she acquired the house she bought in May.

Shaun Jeffrey said while inspecting the house: 'Oh my God! This is years, years in the making. This is not new.'

Running wild: Mice infested the 5,000-square-foot home over an estimated five-year period

Mess: The rodents' faeces and urine filled the vapour barrier and made the house a health hazard

He said that it would have taken about five years to reach this level of infestation.

Although Forsythe did not have the home inspected before she took possession she had been there with architects, engineers and contractors and nobody noticed anything amiss.

The house's previous owner said he knew nothing about an issue with mice and confirmed he would never have sold the property if he had.

Jeffrey said it is possible the owner might not have known because the walls and insulation were both thick.

No inspection: Although an inspection of the house would not include a check inside the walls the problem may have been discovered

A Manitoba Real Estate Association spokesman said the matter will most likely need to be settled in court.

Ari Marantz, a Winnipeg home inspector, said an infestation on this scale is rare in the city.

He confirmed that although a full inspection would not include a check for this it may still have caught the mice issue.

Home sweet home: An infestation of this scale is quite rare in Winnipeg, but more common in rural areas
