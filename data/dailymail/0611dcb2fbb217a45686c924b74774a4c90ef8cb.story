England completed their biggest ever Champions Trophy win over Pakistan, beating their Pool A rivals 8-2 in India.

England came into the match off the back of a 3-1 win over the world's number one side Australia on Saturday and they continued that form with a dominant performance in Bhubaneswar.

Mark Gleghorne got the ball rolling, getting a touch on Alastair Brogdon's cross, before Nick Catlin doubled England's lead with a powerful strike.
