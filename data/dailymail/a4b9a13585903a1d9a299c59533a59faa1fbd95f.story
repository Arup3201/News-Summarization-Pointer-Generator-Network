On the run: Maxwell Parsons, 48, who invented a program that hacked into banking systems, was being hunted by police last night

The mastermind behind a £7.5million credit card scam was being hunted last night.

Self-taught computer fraudster Maxwell Parsons, 48, was sentenced to ten years in jail after going on the run in the middle of his fraud trial.

He invented a program that hacked into banking systems so payments at ATMs and in chip-and-pin machines could be reversed.

This meant his gang could use cards repeatedly without exceeding their credit limits. Most of the frauds were carried out at bureaux de change in Belfast, Manchester and Nottingham.

The foreign currencies bought were then converted back into sterling.

Parsons ran the scam for nearly two years – raking in up to £50,000 a day – before it was smashed by police in 2010.

Yesterday, two of his accomplices were given suspended prison sentences at Manchester Crown Court for their part in the conspiracy.

Police believe Parsons, who disappeared in December, could be living under a false name.

The IT expert, of Gorton, Manchester, carried out his latest scam after developing his computer and hacking skills through a friend who was attending Cambridge University.

He had previously served a 32-month jail term, imposed in 2006, for attaching MP3 players to freestanding cash machines to record customers' data so he could clone their cards.

As customers' bank details and pin numbers were punched in, the data from their cards as they were transmitted down a telephone line was illicitly recorded on to the MP3 players.

Parsons then used software from the Ukraine to 'translate' the tones from the transactions - before using the stolen data to clone new credit cards.

The cards were then used by accomplices to buy £200,000 worth of goods in high street shops, the court heard.

Following his release from prison, Parsons created a hacking computer programme called: 'The Merchant dialler', which exploited a flaw in the 'chip and pin' system where money could not be taken from a purchaser's account for up to three days after a transaction.

Usually a bank would 'earmark' the money
 spent so cardholders would not exceed their limit, but Parsons would 
wire up a laptop via a telephone to the targeted bank's computer and 
hack in.

This meant he could remove the earmark and enable the card to be used 
again.

To rake in as much money as possible, Parsons led an army of 100 'shoppers' who would buy genuine goods knowing he could 'reverse' the transactions, the court heard.

Most transactions were carried out at bureau de changes, so purchased cash could be converted back into sterling. The scam was fully active between December 2008 and June 2009.

Parsons gave himself 50 per cent of all 
profits - with the rest being split between other gang members. He even 
encrypted his own software so his accomplices would not know how to use 
it and steal his secrets.

Mark Giuliani, prosecuting, told the court: 'There
 were serious concerns that the banking systems were under attack and 
that the problem may escalate.

'It was something that had never happened before, in the UK or worldwide, and the banks were not aware that this could actually happen to them.

'This was not a complete reversal of the transaction, but the removal of the electronic earmark on the account. So the actual debit for the goods purchased would eventually accrue to the account.

'The shopper then had the goods bought and also a card which could be used again and again for a period of up to three days.

'As the actual debit would accrue up to three days later there was a limited life to the bank card that was being used and therefore a limit to how much any one card could obtain.

'The more cards that could be used, the more money could be obtained.'

Parsons was caught when bosses at Barclay's Bank, who were investigating the sudden losses of money, traced the landlines which were being used to infiltrate their computers.

Police were then able to raid three addresses in Manchester and seized a number of computers which showed evidence of the computer programme.

They also discovered recently purchased goods relating to the scam including a Playstation 3, an Xbox and a plasma television.

Sentencing Parsons, Judge David Stockdale QC, said: 'This is a case which, very understandably, sent shockwaves through the banking industry.

'It was a unique fraud and no other like
 it has been detected before or since. Maxwell Parsons created the 
device and developed the computer programme and he masterminded its 
execution and controlled everyone involved in it and I am sure had the 
technological know-how to carry out the fraud.

'He is an articulate, intelligent, vociferous and very demanding individual, adept at the manipulation of those around him and he even manipulated members of his legal team.

'Maxwell Parsons was the organiser and driving force behind this conspiracy.. Without him I have no doubt it would not and could not have taken place.

'He masterminded the entire enterprise from start to finish. He is a technically skilled, sophisticated computer fraudster.'

Takhliq Khaliq, 47, of Heaton Mersey, was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 200 hours unpaid work after he admitted conspiracy and false accounting.

His brother Zaki Khaliq, 44, of Bramhall, Cheshire, also admitted conspiracy and will be sentenced later.

Meanwhile, Muhammed Khan, 43, of Alexandra Road South, Whalley Range, Manchester, admitted conspiracy and was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment, suspended for two years.

Yesterday, Detective Constable Carol Britton, of Greater Mancherster Police said: 'This was a systematic, sophisticated and large-scale fraud where a number of people were able to effectively steal money quickly.

'Parsons is a prolific criminal who has deliberately been evasive with the authorities at every opportunity. Throughout this investigation and the trial he has done all he can to delay this day.

'He is a well-practiced, convincing and persuasive liar and can talk himself out of almost any situation. If you recognise this man then please do the right thing straight away and call the police.

'Since this conspiracy, the banks themselves have worked very hard to ensure that a similar scam could not happen again.'
