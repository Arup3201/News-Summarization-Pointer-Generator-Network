A mother-of-two has admitted she cannot stop tanning because she loves 'the Barbie look'.

Tanning mom Sarah Willman admits she is scared of getting cancer but still uses sun beds for at least 20 minutes a day, five days a week.

Despite her own addiction, Mrs Willman said she does not want her daughter Bridget, nine, to ever use sun beds.

The part-time model is scared of getting cancer but can't quit tanning because she loves the 'Barbie look'

The tanorexic, pictured, used to wake at 4am to get her sun bed fix before her children even woke up

The 30-year-old was nicknamed 'Malibu Barbie' at beauty college and continues to maintain her bronzed image - that she has had since she was 14 - even though she realises it is dangerous.

While she was a young mom going to beauty
college, she used to go to two different tanning salons so she could 
tan for 40 minutes a day.

Mrs Willman said she becomes jittery and upset if she cannot get a tanning fix and regularly sneaks of to the salon in her lunch break.

She has even got up at 4am before waking Bridget and six-year-old son Malachi so she could go tanning

Now she regularly goes in the evenings without telling husband Andrew Eppler, 27, an oil rig worker.

Mrs Willman, from Dickinson, North Dakota, said: 'There's times when, if the tanning salon was open at 11pm at night, I'd be there.

'In another town where I lived in, where I went to college, it opened up at 5am and I would go before college.

'Then I got memberships at two tanning salons - because they never knew.'

Husband Andrew said his wife will sneak off to the salon and will not answer her phone or text messages

Mrs Willman (pictured modeling, left, and aged five, right) said she started tanning when she was just 14 because of low self-esteem and now loves the fake Barbie look with her peroxide hair and permanent tan

The mother-of-two said her Barbie image had helped her get booked on photo-shoots

Now the office worker even uses self-tanning lotion and bronzer on top of her sun-bed tan because she feels she is not brown enough.

'I put fake tanner on top of my normal tan in case there's spots I didn't get. You can't always get tanned in certain areas, it's just impossible,' she said.

Her obsession with tanning began when she suffered from low self esteem as a teenager, and spent time on tanning and her appearance to boost her confidence.

'I starting using sun beds when I was 14, but I tanned a lot more when I was 16 or 17, as it was easier to sneak away from my parents,' she admitted.

'I felt like I needed to be this perfect, skinny tan girl. I was trying to fit in and be cool and popular.'

She added: 'Before I had kids I probably spent about $500 a month on clothes because it was so important to me to look good all the time.'

Mrs Willman's peroxide blonde hair, tanned appearance and 'Barbie-girl' style, helped her gain part time work as model, even going to photo-shoots in New York and Las Vegas.

'I've had some crazy opportunities, but I can't always go on the shoots because I have a family,' she said.

Mrs Willman's mother is worried about her addiction but she says she has tried to stop before and failed

Mrs Willman said she is determined to quit 'before it's too late because I want to be there for my kids'

But now, she is starting to worry about the effects of using sun beds on her health and is warning others not to make the same mistakes.

'I think my mom worries, because if I were my mom, and if it was my daughter, I wouldn't be happy with it,' she said.

'I do not want me daughter tanning. I don't my children to ever step in a tanning bed.'

She is too afraid to see a skin care expert for fear they might find evidence of sun damage - but insists she will quit in the future.

'I can't quit, I've tried. But I'm going to try again. I'm scared of getting cancer,' she said.

'I want to quit before it's too late because I want to be there for my kids.'

Husband Andrew added: 'Sarah's beautiful the way she is and she doesn't need to tan.

'When she's getting off work and sneaking to the tanning booth and not telling me where she's at, won't answer her phone or text messages, it's like this is borderline addiction therapy needed.'

Leading dermatologist Doris Day, from Day Dermatology and Aesthetics in New York, said: 'For some people with tanorexia - it could be a form of obsessive compulsive disorder or even depression and treating for those conditions may help break the habit of tanning.'

Last year, the original Tanning Mom, Patricia Krentcil, from New Jersey, hit the headlines when she was arrested for allegedly taking her five-year-old daughter, Anna, into a tanning booth.
