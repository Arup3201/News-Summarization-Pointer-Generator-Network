Marco Reus has warned Germany that Scotland will be no pushovers when the two sides meet in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier in Dortmund on Sunday.

Gordon Strachan's men go into the match against the world champions on a year-long unbeaten run, while the hosts went down 4-2 to Argentina in a friendly on Wednesday.

Scotland have not qualified for a major tournament for 16 years, but Reus backed them to qualify from their group this time.

'The Scots won twice against Croatia,' the Borussia Dortmund midfielder, who missed the World Cup through injury, said at a press conference.

'They have a very strong team, which plays competitively at a high level and closes the space well.

'We need to be much better than against Argentina. In front of goal we need to be more determined and use our chances better.

'Scotland definitely have a chance of finishing in second place. With Darren Fletcher they have a real leader, up front they have quick and dangerous players. You have to be patient against them.'

Germany's goalkeeping coach Andreas Kopke had words of praise for Scotland goalkeeper Allan McGregor, describing him as 'experienced' and 'consistent if unspectacular'.

'That he is a regular in the Premier League speaks for itself,' he added.
