Liverpool striker Rickie Lambert must be given more of a chance at Anfield to add variety to their attack claims Stan Collymore.

The England international started against West Brom on Saturday but hasn’t scored for Liverpool yet in eight appearances.

With Daniel Sturridge the number one choice up front and with the arrival of Mario Balotelli this summer, Lambert has found sustained game time limited so far this season.

Former Liverpool striker Collymore is concerned with the club’s mixed start to the campaign:

‘I'm worried about Liverpool. They had a disappointing Champions League performance against Basel, and Brendan Rodgers is being stretched to his coaching limit right now,’ Collymore told bleacher report.

In order to turn form around Collymore believes Lambert is needed and could be the catalyst to enable Brendan Rodgers to rotate his side and add diversity to their attack.

‘When it comes to strikers, Mario Balotelli is the opposite of Luis Suarez. I wonder if there's the option to play two up front and a diminutive three behind.

‘Rickie Lambert could be very useful, but only if he's given a run of five or six games to settle in and do the business.

‘I've been a striker at that level. You have to find your rhythm, and you need games to get into a groove.

'I'd go with a 4-4-2 diamond that includes Balotelli and Lambert. That would give Rodgers the chance to rest Daniel Sturridge, or use all three, with one of Balotelli or Sturridge in a withdrawn role.

‘Rodgers has to make something happen at Liverpool, and Lambert could be the catalyst.’
