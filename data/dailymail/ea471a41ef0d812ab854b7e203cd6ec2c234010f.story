Senior Tory Dr Liam Fox claimed three pence from the taxpayer to drive 100 yards in his constituency.

The former Cabinet minister – who is being tipped for a return to frontline politics – submitted 16 expense claims for less than £1 each in travel costs in the last financial year.

Staff who preside over MPs’ expenses even rounded the lowest claim up, from 2.8p, for the 0.06 mile journey.

Driving by: North Somerset MP Liam Fox - who owns two properties worth a combined £1million - claimed 16 times for travel expenses worth less than £1 in the last financial year, according to official data

Walkable in a minute: Dr Fox claimed the money for driving the 0.06 miles between Stowell Concrete factory (bottom left) in Yatton, Somerset, and his nearby North Somerset constituency surgery (centre)

It was for driving between Stowell 
Concrete factory in Yatton, Somerset, to his constituency surgery in 
Horsecastle Chapel, Yatton, in October last year. The journey would have
been walkable in minutes.

Dr
Fox – who served as Defence Secretary until being forced out of office 
for his close ties to lobbyist Adam Werritty in 2011 – earns £66,000 as a
backbencher.

Until he 
resigned from the Cabinet, his salary was £134,000 a year. He was also a
property millionaire, owning two homes worth at least £1.2million, 
until December last year when he sold his flat in London.

MPs are allowed to claim up to 45p a mile for car journeys.

Dr Fox said: ‘I don’t do my expenses, my office does them.’ He did not return the Mail’s call about the expenses claims.

Officials
at the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority were believed to 
have been deeply amused by the incident. One source is reported saying 
that his original claim was for 2.8p but ‘we rounded it up to 3p’.

Mileage: A building in Yatton, Somerset, where MP Liam Fox holds his constituency surgeries. Dr Fox filed a 3p expense claim for driving 0.06 of a mile from a nearby factory to this building

Short trip: Stowell Concrete Factory in Yatton, Somerset - 100 yards away from Dr Fox's constituency surgery

The
former leadership hopeful was the darling of the Tory right and the new
intake of Conservative MPs in 2005. But he failed to win the leadership
race against David Cameron, coming third behind David Davis.

In
March 2010, Dr Fox also appealed against a Commons’ watchdog decision 
that he had over-claimed £22,476. However, he dropped the appeal and 
repaid the cash.

He bought 
his five-bedroom, detached constituency home for £680,000 in 2006. The 
modern house boasts 1.3 acres of lawn with stunning views across the 
north Somerset countryside and has walk-in-wardrobes and terraces.

Dr
Fox also sold his two-bedroom flat in Central London for £600,000 last 
December after receiving rental income on it. Labour MP John Mann said: 
‘This is an example of how MPs don’t get it. It comes across as extreme 
greed.

Entry: He was entitled to 2.8p for the trip, but the amount was rounded up to 3p by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority and paid to Dr Fox last December. This is the entry, taken from IPSA data

‘Anyone who can claim 3p demonstrates how out of touch they are with what is happening to people in this country.’

Stephen Pound, another Labour MP, said: ‘If he’s that hard-up, I’ll lend him a fiver till pay-day.’

Eleanor
McGrath, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It beggars belief he 
submitted a claim for 3p. That figure was doubtless dwarfed by the cost 
of processing the claim.’

However,
a Tory supporter of Dr Fox, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: ‘Liam
was raised in a council house, so he knows about counting the pennies. 
If anything, his meticulous accounting shows he could be an asset in the
Treasury.’
