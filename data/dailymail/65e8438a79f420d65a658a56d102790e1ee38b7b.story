April and Michael Jace celebrated their ten-year wedding anniversary last June.

Photos from April's Facebook page show her playing happily with her three children, the oldest of whom is from a previous relationship.

Detectives were investigating whether the couple's financial problems or other marital difficulties played a role in the killing.

It has emerged Jace filed for bankruptcy in March 2011 citing $500,000 in debts and an annual income of around $80,000.

He filed for Chapter 13, restructured his finances and reduced his mortgage, but owed $411,000 on the home where his wife was killed and it was believed to be on the brink of a foreclosure.

Police Detective Dean Vinluan said there had been no reports of domestic violence at the home.

However, it was revealed in court papers from his divorce to first wife Jennifer Bitterman that he had an explosive temper and hit her on 'multiple' occasions.

Divorce papers seen by MailOnline claim that Jace had an alleged fearsome temper. Close friend Maria De La Vega testified on behalf of Bitterman. She said: 'Jordan was six months old. I was in the house and witnessed the first episode of physical abuse.

'Responsdent was raging and choked and hit petitioner and slammed her against the wall while Jordan screamed in the crib next to her'.

She claimed that 'there were multiple physical assaults' on Bitterman.

Bitterman petitioned for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences in 1995. The couple separated for good in 1997, but did not have the divorce finalized until 2002.

In the papers, De La Vega claimed she saw the extent of anger and added that the things she saw were 'terrifying'. She added that it was clear that Jace's 'ambition was the most important thing to him and not his son and wife'.

In 2005, as Bitterman and Jace continued to fight over custody, the actor's ex-wife said in a declaration: 'The Respondent threatens corporal punishment and has spanked jordan for crying and being afraid. The Respondent's intimidation style of discipline has been a source of great anxiety to Jordan'.

Then in a 2006 declaration, Bitterman claimed Jace screamed at Bitterman in front of Jordan, harassed her in phone calls and also sent the 'I will f***ing kill you!' email.Bitterman was awarded primary custody.

According to TMZ, April astonishingly testified on Jace's behalf. She said he provided a stable home for Jordan.Jace is best known for his role as LAPD Officer Julien Lowe in The Shield. He also appeared on the show Southland and had small roles in the movies Planet of the Apes, Boogie Nights and Forrest Gump.
