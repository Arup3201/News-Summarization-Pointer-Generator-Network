The biological mother of a five-year-old boy who was found severely malnourished and covered in bruises revealed her relief today at being reunited with her son after the child's father banned her from seeing him.

Windy Hall also told of the shocking abuse that her son had allegedly suffered at the hands of his father Bradley Bleimeyer, 24, and 33-year-old stepmother Tammie Bleimeyer.

The little boy, who weighs just 29lb, told his mom and grandmother that he was padlocked in a closet under the stairs at the Texas home. He was given just a piece of bread and a cup of water or milk each day and fed drugs when visitors came to the house to keep him quiet.

Windy Hall told KHOU today: 'It was the most amazing thing. It was 
like giving birth again, it was amazing, he knew who I was.  I tried not
 to cry, I have to be strong for him.'

She said that her son, who remains in Texas Children's Hospital, has eaten spaghetti and a grilled cheese.

However she said that he constantly looks around him when he's eating like someone is going to take the food away.

Stepmother Tammie Bleimeyer claims that she knew nothing of the mistreatment of her five-year-old stepson

The little boy's grandmother Jacqueline Hall said he has told her that he was given drugs to keep him quiet and wasn't allowed to eat at the dinner table with his other siblings, who are the children of his stepmother Tammi Bleimeyer.

Miss Hall believes that her son was kept in these conditions for about a year.

She said that every time she leaves the room, her son looks up in alarm and she has to remind him that she's coming back.

A custody hearing will be held on April 21.

On Tuesday, the victim's pregnant stepmother claimed to be unaware of his horrific condition because she had not seen him with his shirt off recently.  

Mother-of-six Tammie Bleimeyer, 33, and her husband Bradley, 24, were charged with felony child endangerment this weekend after allegedly keeping the little boy locked under the stairs.

Tammie claims that she never mistreated the child and that she and her husband separated last summer.

Her ex no longer lives at her home in Spring, Texas, Tammie Bleimeyer said, but took his five-year-old son to live in Alabama. Mrs Bleimeyer filed for divorce on Tuesday from her husband of two years.

Tammie Bleimeyer told KHOU on Tuesday: 'I was shocked. I have never seen him look like that and I have never seen him with his shirt off recently.'

Tammie Bleimeyer and her husband Bradley appear in court charged with child endangerment of their five-year-old son

The boy's father Bradley Bleimeyer allegedly locked the five-year-old boy under the stairs and starved him

However she doesn't necessarily believe that her estranged husband caused the child's condition.

The 33-year-old added: 'I don’t know what caused him to 
look like that. I don’t know if it’s a health issue or something else 
like that. I don’t want to be like everyone else and assume 
the worse.'

Police discovered a locked closet with
 a mattress at the Bleimeyer home after being called following a disturbance last 
Thursday between Bradley Bleimeyer and his 16-year-old stepson.

The
 teenager raised the alarm and told police he had found his five-year-old stepbrother in a diaper under the stairs.

The
 stepmother denied that the boy was kept under the stairs but had a room
 and slept in a bunk bed.

However she admitted that the child could have
 fitted under the stairs.

She
 also said that her 16-year-old son was lying because he did not respect
 his stepfather Bradley, who is only eight years older than him.

The child's stepmother Tammie Bleimeyer had reportedly fled the home with the boy before officers arrived, according to click2houston.

Bleimeyer,
 who is six months' pregnant, refused to return to the home when 
contacted by police.

She was tracked to a motel in Humble by her 
cellphone where she was found with the boy.

The pregnant 33-year-old told KHOU that she did not flee 
with the child but had simply gone to get pizza and that her husband was
 staying at the motel.

His frail body was photographed covered in bumps and bruises with a deep cut on his right shoulder.

Tammie Bleimeyer was charged with endangering a child and released on $2,000 bond.

Imprisoned: The boy was found in a closet under the stairs wearing his diaper. It is unclear how long he'd been held there

Bradley
 Bleimeyer, who was already out on bond for a burglary charge, was also 
charged with endangering a child.

The 24-year-old, who has spent time in
 jail and has string of prior convictions, is being held without bond.

Bradley Bleimeyer is the biological father of the five-year-old. His expectant wife is the biological mother of six children including the 16-year-old boy.

All the children are being cared for by other family members. The health of the other children is currently unknown.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Harris County Precinct 4 officers.

A hearing is yet to be scheduled for the Bleimeyers.
