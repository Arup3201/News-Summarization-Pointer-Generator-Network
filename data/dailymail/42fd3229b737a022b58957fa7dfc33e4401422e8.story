Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has confirmed defender Kieran Gibbs will be out for three weeks after suffering a hamstring injury.

The 24-year-old left back limped off during Saturday's 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace in the Premier League.

Gibbs was left behind as the squad flew to Turkey for Tuesday's Champions League qualifying tie against Besiktas.

Wenger has warned his Arsenal team to improve after Saturday’s sluggish performance against Crystal Palace.

Arsenal stumbled to victory with Aaron Ramsey’s 90th minute winner against Palace, but they face a tough test against Besiktas in the Champions League qualifier in Istanbul.

Wenger said: ‘I am more positive this year but the reality is the performance. What is important is that we are not happy with the performance against Palace on Saturday, there is room for improvement. We need to bring that into our game tomorrow.

‘It is a big test because we have had a short preparation. We know that in one week we have three big games: Palace, Besiktas, then Everton. From the start of the season it is a big test.

‘Every chance is different. To win against a Turkish team is difficult. We know it is a difficult game and we have to perform at our very best.

‘Besiktas have had a very good result against Feyenoord so will be on our toes. We want to produce a good performance.’ Laurent Koscielny has shaken off an achilles injury to travel and will partner young Calum Chambers in defence.

Striker Yaya Sanogo has also been ruled out by a hamstring problem. Per Mertesacker, who was on stand-by to travel, has been left in London.
