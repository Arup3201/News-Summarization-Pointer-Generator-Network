As flu season begins to ramp up, health experts say the vaccine does not protect well against the current strain sweeping across America.

The variant - influenza A (H3N2) - has been linked to higher rates of hospitalization and death, especially in the elderly.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials say the shot should still provide some protection, but it would be better if the vaccine strain was an exact match to the mutation.

Cold front approaching: As flu season begins to ramp up, officials say the vaccine does not protect well against the current strain sweeping across America

Flu vaccine effectiveness tends to vary from year to year. 

Last winter, flu vaccine was about 60 per cent effective overall, which experts consider good.

The CDC issued an advisory to doctors about the situation on Wednesday.

It noted that flu virus samples the agency took from October 1 through November 22, showed that just under half were a good match for the  influenza A flu strain contained in the current H3N2lu shots for 2014-2015.

Current view: Flu vaccine effectiveness tends to vary from year to year - Last winter, flu vaccine was about 60 per cent effective overall, which experts consider good.

In past seasons when the influenza A strain has mutated, the
vaccine has apparently been less effective.

The CDC is stressing that doctors should be prepared to use
antiviral medications when needed. 

These include Roche's
 Tamiflu and GlaxoSmithKline's Relenza. 

While the vaccine is not as effective against a mutated strain, it can still decrease the severity of symptoms.

It can also protect against other circulating strains of the virus, which is why the CDC still recommends everyone six months of age and older getting vaccinated.
