Tottenham's imminent hiring of Southampton’s head of recruitment Paul Mitchell could hasten the demise of Spurs’s technical director Franco Baldini. 

But Spurs have been warned that instead of operating a revolving door policy for staff and attempting a ‘short-cut route’ to success by poaching people from better-run clubs, they need a coherent plan, boardroom consistency and to back a single manager long term to achieve the progress their fans crave.

Mitchell, 33, a former defender and midfielder at Wigan and MK Dons, has been at St Mary’s since 2012 and is credited with a key role in the scouting and hiring set up that helped Saints emerge from a troubled summer with an upgraded squad and a £37million profit to boot.

Paul Mitchell's task is to overhaul Tottenham's scouting system and have the success he did at Southampton

Tottenham technical director Franco Baldini could be heading for the White Hart Lane exit door 

Roberto Soldado Spanish, 29, F, £26.4m

Verdict: Underwhelming. Six goals and six assists in 33 Premier League games is a costly return.

Erik Lamela Argentinian, 22, AM, £25.7m

Verdict: Nearly-man. Lavish talent but no goals in 20 PL games.

Paulinho Brazilian, 26, M, £17.4m 

Verdict: Miss. Far from the best midfielder in north London, let alone Brazil.

Etienne Capoue French, 26, M, £9.7m

Verdict: Jury out. Patchy form and injuries have disrupted his season.

Christian Eriksen Danish, 22, M, £11.5m

Verdict: Mercurial. Brilliant last season, less so this. 10 PL goals, eight assists.

Ben Davies Welsh, 21, D, £10m 

Verdict: Miss. One PL game is a poor return.

Vlad Chiriches Romanian, 25, D, £8.5m

Verdict: Middling at best. Solid early but unreliable.

Federico Fazio Argentinian, 27, D £8m

Verdict: Miss. Error-prone, two red cards already.

Nacer Chadli Belgian, 25, AM, £7.2m 

Verdict: Hit. Best value of all, PL goals (seven) and assists (four).

Eric Dier English, 20, D, £4m 

Verdict: Promising. Early goals (two in PL) and shows potential.

Ben Stambouli, French, 24, M, £4.7m

Verdict: Miss. Just one sub PL appearance.

DeAndre Yedlin (US, 21, £2.5m) & Michel Vorm (Dutch, 31, £5m) Yedlin on loan. Vorm yet to play in PL.

Tottenham lured manager Mauricio Pochettino from Southampton in the summer, will add Mitchell when his notice period expires in the new year and have coveted Saints players included Jay Rodriguez and Morgan Schneiderlin.

Baldini, 54, has been in his job since summer last year and oversaw player departures including Spurs’ best player and talisman Gareth Bale for a world record £86m.

But the jury has been out on many of the 13 faces brought in partly with the cash raised, from Paulinho to Roberto Soldado to Erik Lamela and, more recently, Federico Fazio and Ben Stambouli.

‘Franco is pretty relaxed about the situation but he knows in football that people come and go and that he’ll be moving on at some point, whenever that is,’ said a source.

Another insider familiar with the workings at both White Hart Lane and St Mary’s said of Spurs: ‘It doesn’t appear that they have a strategy of any ilk, it seems to be a case of seeing Southampton do things well so let’s take a short cut and hire their people.

‘It will work sometimes and others won’t go near them but ultimately it’s a naive approach. Sustainable success is not about individuals, it’s about a culture.’ 

Many fans believe Spurs’ managerial merry-go-round has hurt the club, with Pochettino the fifth permanent boss in seven years since Juande Ramos joined in 2007.

The turnover of players has exacerbated the situation and Pochettino has been left with a squad that cannot or will not function in the high-tempo pressing system he used to such effect at Southampton.

Results have suffered, with Spurs losing three of their last four league games before Sunday's trip to Hull. 

The home capitulation to Stoke last time out has been described as the worst performance many have seen in a long time.

Tottenham fan Martin Cloake,  an author, whose latest book Taking Our Ball Back looks at discontent within the wider game.

‘It’s clear that there has been too much change in personnel recently,’ he says of Spurs’ dilemma. ‘There’s not much sense of team spirit evident when we play and no real leaders stand out.

Paulinho and Roberto Soldado are among the players who have failed to impress since joining the club

Tottenham's Harry Kane has said his team-mates need time to adapt to Mauricio Pochettino's style 

‘There are lots of players with potential flair, perhaps fewer of the type who will dig in and help to hold a team together — therefore letting the flair players express themselves.

‘Off the pitch, the phrase ‘I’ve never felt so disconnected from the club I support’ keeps coming up. That’s partly because of the discontent with the top level of football in this country but it’s also because those running the club too often come across as aloof and as treating the fans as cash cows. 

'Fixing things on the pitch will take time and the vast majority of fans want Pochettino to be given time. There has been too much chopping, changing and blaming. Off the pitch the club just needs to show goodwill, talk to the fans more, resolve some of the uncertainties around the stadium and generally demonstrate that we’re seen as supporters and not just customers.’

Striker Harry Kane acknowledges a lengthy transition period could lie ahead. ‘We haven’t won as much as we’d have liked.’ he said. ‘But there is a long way to go. We are adapting to the [manager’s] style each game and we are learning. Hopefully we can pick up some momentum and then who knows?

‘[The manager] has come in with his style and it has only been four months. That’s not long when you are changing the way you want to play. We are getting used to it and we will only get better.’
