Prime Minister David Cameron claimed a number of small amounts back from the taxpayer - including 38p for a staple remover

We have all heard of the £1,600 duck house, wide-screen TVs, moats cleared for £2,200 and many of the other extravagances that MPs put on their expenses.

After the scandal was exposed and a new, tougher system was introduced to try to stop abuse, it was thought MPs would no longer be claiming repayment from taxpayers for risible items.

But now, rather than submitting outrageously expensive claims, they are accused of squeezing every last penny out of the taxpayer by requesting repayment for the most mundane things.

For example, David Cameron charged the public purse 7p for a bulldog clip and 38p for a staple remover.

Apart from appearing petty, it also raises the issue of the cost of the bureaucracy involved and whether the PM and his staff ought not be better employed running the country rather than filling in forms to reclaim such piffling amounts.

For Mr Cameron’s bulldog clip wouldn’t have made much of a dent in his estimated £4million fortune, and when you consider the cost of office time processing the claim, it will ultimately have landed taxpayers with a bill around four times the cost price.

So, what other measly items of stationery have MPs claimed from the taxpayer in Westminster’s equivalent of Poundland?

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who recently pocketed £17  million from the sale of an educational resources company in which he had invested, claimed 5p in Parliamentary expenses for a paperclip. He also claimed 8p for a page marker and 41p for a black folder.

Such expenses make former Solicitor-General and ex-Labour MP for Redcar Vera Baird look a spendthrift: she claimed 49p for ‘cable clips’ and 69p for a dustpan.

Cameron also claimed a whole 7p bulldog clip

Another who evidently goes shopping for domestic wares in Poundland’s half-price sale at the taxpayers’ expense is John Barrett, Lib Dem MP for Edinburgh West, who claimed 49p for a doormat and 35p for a ballpoint pen.

Maybe the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, the body charged with overhauling politicians’ pay and pensions in the wake of the 2009 expenses scandal, would now frown on the 48p claimed by former Labour health secretary John Reid for a bottle of Morrisons’ toilet cleaner. But equally ludicrous claims still get through the system.

Certainly, rules governing expenses have been tightened. MPs are no longer allowed to claim, for example, the cost of cleaning, gardening or buying furniture for their designated second home.

However, it is still possible to submit claims for a wide variety of items such as TV bills, council tax, utility bills, travel and lunch costs for interns.

Labour's Harriet Harman was repaid 10p for some drawing pins

Thus, Tory backbencher Penny Mordaunt, who earned £10,000 for her belly-flop appearance on the ITV show Splash!, giving the fee to a run-down lido in her constituency, was able to claim 90p in expenses for a trip to the very same lido — which is in the same road as her constituency office.

She defended herself, saying: ‘The claim was for a staff member who used her car to make a visit to the lido as part of the support work we do with them . . . This was not a recreational visit and it is entirely reasonable that she be compensated.’

For three years, during the economic crisis, Labour’s Alistair Darling was in charge of the nation’s finances as Chancellor. But he managed to find time to concentrate on his own finances — claiming 70p for a postage stamp and 64p for a gluestick. Indeed, claims for stationery seem to be among the most petty.

Pat McFadden, Labour MP for Wolverhampton South East, put in a claim for 19p for Blu-Tac adhesive, while Tory MP Julian Sturdy (York Outer) claimed 66p for ballpoint pens. Maybe he needed them to fill out his expense forms.

Liam Byrne, Labour’s one-time Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is best known for leaving his Coalition successor a flippant note saying: ‘Sorry — there’s no money left.’

But clearly he thought that taxpayers’ munificence was not entirely exhausted, claiming back 46p for a set of Post-it notes.

Taxpayers’ hard-earned money has also been used to repay 10p to Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman (who owns two homes) for some drawing pins, and 34p to buy Alan Johnson, Labour’s former Home Secretary, a pack of ten fold-back clips.

Meanwhile, Chi Onwurah, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central, claimed 18p on a mouse-mat for her computer. Not to be outdone, Sarah Teather, Lib Dem MP for Brent Central, claimed 17p for a pack of staples.

All these claims involve work either at home or at the office, but MPs also cost us money when they go on the move.

Rosie Cooper, Labour MP, claimed 29p for a packet of Hula Hoops and 30p for a jam doughnut

Former Tory Cabinet minister Liam Fox got into hot water for the cost of driving 100 yards from a cement firm to his constituency surgery. The sum was calculated at the 45p per mile rate which MPs can claim when using their own car on Parliamentary business. In the space of a year, Dr Fox made 15 travel claims for under £1.

While other motorists complain of high parking charges, Sheryll Murray, Conservative MP for  South East Cornwall, has no such worries. On five occasions she claimed 20p for parking at her constituency surgery.

Nick Harvey, Lib Dem MP for North Devon, has claimed the same amount for parking in his constituency.

And Tristram Hunt, Labour MP for Stoke on Trent Central and Shadow Education Secretary, claimed 4p — the smallest possible amount for mileage — for ‘travel within own constituency’. It was a distance of just 176 yards.

It’s not all car travel, though. Hugh Bayley, Labour MP for York Central, claimed 40p for a two-mile bike ride around his constituency. ‘It’s not free to ride a bicycle,’ he protested when challenged. ‘They have to be maintained.’

Mr Darling was repaid 70p for a postage stamp and 64p for a gluestick while in charge of the nation's finances

After all that pedalling, it is little wonder that MPs get a bit peckish, and who would deny them a light snack? Rosie Cooper, Labour MP for West Lancashire, claimed 29p for a packet of Hula Hoops, 30p for a white chocolate cookie, 30p for a jam doughnut and 35p for a Bounty bar.

Her high-calorie choice raised eyebrows, given that she has backed the British Heart Foundation’s campaign against hidden salt, fat and sugar in our diets.

But she defended herself by arguing that she didn’t eat them — they were bought for an  unpaid intern.  

However, not all claims are approved. Mike Weatherley, Tory MP for Hove, saw his claim of 50p for a pint of milk rejected.

Maybe it was the extra penny that made the difference because Adrian Sanders, MP for Torbay, was successful after submitting a claim for 49p for a pinta on expenses, as did Norman Baker, Lib Dem MP for Lewes. While Jeremy Wright, MP for Kenilworth, felt it was his right to claim back 99p for ‘office water’.

Not surprisingly, such tiny claims often make front page news in MPs’ local newspapers. That’s why they are avid readers of the local press.

Proof of this comes from the fact that Andrew Selous, Conservative MP for South West Bedfordshire, claimed 75p for ‘purchase of Leighton Buzzard newspapers’, while Mike Pawsley, MP for Rugby, enjoyed reading the Rugby Advertiser at a cost of 65p  to taxpayers.

Such petty claims surely belie MPs’ attempts to assure voters they have cleaned up their act.

When tackled about the piddling amounts involved, many MPs (David Cameron was one) explained the claims were submitted by staff in their constituency office without their knowledge.

Also, the reason the amounts were so small was that the system had changed so that individual items of stationery had to be listed rather than as part of a bulk order.

With the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority scrutinising their claims as never before, some have complained at the bureaucracy involved in filling out their expense forms.

What a shame, though, that a few more of them don’t seem to realise it would take up a lot less of their time if they were not so obsessed with claiming for every last doughnut and paperclip.
