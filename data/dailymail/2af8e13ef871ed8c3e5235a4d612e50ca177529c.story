 

Tasered teen: Bryce Masters isno longer in a medically induced coma and is speaking with family members

The Missouri police officer who used a stun gun on a 17-year-old during a traffic stop says he smelled marijuana in the vehicle and saw him recording the incident on an iPhone.

Bryce Masters has been upgraded from critical to serious condition at a hospital where he was taken Sunday after the Independence police officer used a Taser on him.

A spokesman for Masters' family says he went into cardiac arrest and was being treated for a lack of oxygen to his brain.

According to a search warrant application, the officer smelled marijuana inside the car. 

Police said they later found drug paraphernalia.

Police say Masters was pulled over because of a warrant attached to the license plate of the vehicle and was combative when ordered to get out. 

The Kansas City Star reports 17-year-old Bryce Masters of Independence began slowly recovering overnight and was able to answer questions from hospital staff on Wednesday. 

Family attorney Daniel Haus characterized the recovery as a miracle.

Masters' family has said his heart stopped after he was shocked with the stun gun during a traffic stop on Sunday in Independence.

Bryce suffered some memory loss and doctors do not yet know what the long term affects will be. 

Police say he was combative and wouldn't comply with the officer's demands. 

They say he was pulled over because of a warrant associated with the license plate on the car, which belonged to someone else.

'They are seeing some signals that their son may make a fairly remarkable recovery, basically coming back from the dead,' Haus told theKansas City Star.'It looks like whatever the doctors did with this medically induced coma, this new procedure where they lower the body temperature, was exactly what he needed,' Haus added.

The FBI is investigating after a police officer used a stun gun to subdue Bryce Masters in suburban Kansas City, Missouri, on Sunday afternoon after stopping a car he was driving because it had a warrant attached to it.

The officer, identified by the police department as Tim Runnels, has been placed on administrative leave.

Police said in the statement that Bryce became uncooperative and physically resisted getting out of the car, prompting Runnels to warn Bryce he would use a stun gun.

Police said the stun gun was used on Bryce while he was still in the car but he was able to get out of the car on his own.

The confrontation continued outside the car and both Bryce and Runnels fell to the ground. 

The teen then suffered a 'medical emergency' and needed resuscitation, prompting a call for an ambulance, police said.

But eyewitnesses gave a different account to Fox4KC.

Michelle Baker filmed the incident on her mobile phone when she heard screams outside and says she saw the Runnels Taser the teen when he was inside his car.  

In a cell phone video taken by Baker you can see the officer dragging the teen's body to the sidewalk, then standing with his foot on the teen's back.

You could tell the kid was going into convulsions. 

'He turned him over and his head was dangling like this and he had blood coming out,' said Baker.

Curtis Martes, 17, says the teen was coming over to play XBox with him.  

'I hear him say from my porch he's like 'I can't roll down my window it's broke,' said Martes. 

'He was like 'what am I being arrested for?' The cop just grabbed him and said 'you're under arrest,' said Martes.

He is then (pictured) seen raising his foot as Master lies on the ground. 'He like threw him on the ground busted his face up. He kept like nudging him with his foot,' said Curtis Martes, 17, who watched the event unfold

He said the officer Tasered the teen then pulled him out of the car.

'He like threw him on the ground busted his face up. He kept like nudging him with his foot,' said Martes.  

'Several times, the cop put his foot on the kid like he was stepping on his neck, but it was on his back,' said Robert Baker, who lives nearby told The Kansas City Star. 

'I think (the officer) was wrong, because the kid tried to explain to him that his window won't roll down.'

The FBI's Kansas City office will investigate whether Runnels used excessive force, which falls under the bureau's civil rights program, the FBI said in a statement. 

Independence police pledged to cooperate with the investigation.

'We would conduct a thorough investigation, regardless of who the parents are,' Independence police Maj. Paul Thurman said.

Colin Masters, Bryce's brother, told 41 Action News the teen may have stopped breathing for more than five minutes.

'We've been getting a lot of support from friends and family,' Colin explained. 

'He had probably 30-40 people at the hospital with him yesterday so everyone's banking on Bryce being the strong kid that he is and coming back to us.

The family issued a statement Monday asking that the U.S. Department of Justice investigate the confrontation 'because of significant inconsistencies between public statements made by the Independence Police Department and information made available to the family in the form of statements of eyewitnesses and video and audio footage of the occurrence.'

The family's attorney, Daniel J. Haus, said they would have no further comment until the federal investigation is complete.
