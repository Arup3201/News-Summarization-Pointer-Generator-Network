The Hammonds appear to be like any other ordinary Australian family.

But Cary and Jon's extraordinary journey began when their first child was brought into the world sooner than anticipated.

Little Evie was delivered at 30 weeks, weighing just 1.2kg. This wasn't the kind of parenthood the Victorian couple had imagined.

The Hammond family, from Victoria, are this year's ambassadors of Walk for Prems - an annual event which aims to raise funds for families with premature and sick babies

'I had the most perfect pregnancy,' Mrs Hammond told Daily Mail Australia.

'No morning sickness, I wasn't showing that much and I still very active.'

The complications started when Mrs Hammond discovered she had a severe case of pre-eclampsia.

'I was in utter shock and bewilderment,' she said.

'It was a foreign world to me. I had no family history of it and all my sisters gave birth without any complications.

'We just had no knowledge on what we were about to embark on and it was so scary, so daunting.'

Evie was born 10 weeks early in October 2007 and was held in The Royal Women's Hospital's neonatal intensive care unit, in Melbourne, for seven to eight weeks.

'My mother-in-law described her as two pounds of butter but I was telling people that Evie was like a 1.25 L coke bottle with arms and legs,' Mrs Hammond said.

Two years later, when the couple received the news of twins, they tried to prepare themselves for the worst.

'We kept saying the twins are probably going to come early,' Mrs Hammond said.

'We thought we'd probably have them at 34 weeks and we were comfortable with that.'

But the obstetrician told them otherwise.

'If you make it to 30 weeks, I'd be wrapped,â€™ the doctor told them.

At that point, Mrs Hammond felt helpless that she couldn't do anything about the situation.

'I felt like I had failed as a mother,' she said.

'You just blame it on yourself. The one thing you think you should be able to do as a female is to have a baby.

'But I was putting them through a horrible, an absolutely horrible, start to life.'

Billy and Sonny were born at 28 weeks in October 2009, weighing 698g and 1150g.

'We thought we'd be okay because we'd been through it but when we actually entered into that world, it was completely different from before,' Mrs Hammond said.

'When I saw Billy, I was so horrified at how small he was. He was the size of a coke can with arms and legs.'

Mrs Hammond had to wait three weeks until she could hold Sonny for the first time.

'Sonny had some heart problems, nearly died on day four when he contracted a staph infection and doctors thought he wasn't going to make it,' she said.

'So he was on a ventilator for a month and he was still on it when I cuddled him at three-weeks-old.

'There were lots of tears. It felt so surreal. It was an amazing and precious moment.'

While Sonny battled through and started showing signs of recovery, Billy couldn't get his breathing and feeding under control.

Consequently, he was on oxygen for a year and a half and was fed through a tube until he was three years old.

He had his first taste of real food at the age of two.

The twins spent 99 days in the same neonatal intensive care unit as Evie. However Billy was soon readmitted to hospital and was in and out for over a year.

'I'm so proud of my kids, so proud of our journey and how far we've come,' Mrs Hammond said

Through it all, the Hammonds couldn't be any closer.

'If it wasn't for my parents and Jon's parents, I don't know if we would've survived,' Mrs Hammond said.

'At the time we would just cling onto any kind of positiveness. It was way to keep sane. Otherwise we would crush and not cope.'

This year the Hammonds have been named the official ambassadors for the 2014 Life's Little Treasure Foundation's Walk for Prems.

The annual event will be held across Australia on October 26 to raise funds for families of premature or sick babies.

'I'm very honoured,' Mrs Hammond said.

'I'm so proud of my kids, so proud of our journey and how far we've come.'

She hopes to raise awareness to let other parents know that they're not alone.

'There are so many of us out there and it's not your fault that this happened,' she said.

While Evie, 6, and the twins, 4, are thriving at school there are still some health complications.

'They still have a lot of issues but when we think about how may not have been here, we're just so happy they're alive,' Mrs Hammond said.
