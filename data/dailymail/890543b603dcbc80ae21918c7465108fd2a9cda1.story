It may not look like a typical sundial, but this cube could help you tell the time without ever having to look at a clock.

Inside the cryptic cube are hundreds of metal channels cut to exactly match the angle of the sun in the sky.

As the sun hits the cube, the channels project dot-matrix style numbers onto a surface to mark the hours passing. 

The ‘Sun Cube’ is the brainchild of Toronto-based artist Daniel Voshart who recently shared his invention on Reddit.

He describes how he spent a month making the laser-cut sundial for his father's birthday last July.

Mr Voshart was inspired by solargraphs which are pinhole photographs, typically capturing the passage of the sun over days or even months.

But don’t get rid of your clock just yet, as even Mr Voshart claims there are some major drawbacks to the design.

As the sun hits the cube, the channels project dot-matrix style numbers onto a surface to mark the hours passing. 

 By mapping the angle of the sun in the sky each day, Daniel Voshart was able to input his data into a computer programme that used Boolean logic.

The computer programme was able automatically subtract one shape from another shape to come up with the perfect design.

For instance, Mr Voshart said it can only be used one month in the year and will only work within 100 miles of his father’s home.

As well as this, it could only be used for 40 years because of the changing tilt in Earth's axis.

‘A friend wanted to [do] a Kickstarter for this, for the GE inventor series. I wouldn't let him I was like "no, it's not interesting",’ Mr Voshart told Placeholder Magazine.

‘It's an obscure toy that works in one part of the world. And it's a clock. It's inventing something that is actually worse than what exists on the market. A cereal box has more functionality’.

Mr Voshart, however, is considering building a large scale sculptural version for the Burning Man festival in Nevada's Black Rock Desert.
