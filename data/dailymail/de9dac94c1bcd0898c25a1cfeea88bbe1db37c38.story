Argiris Asderakis has been cleared of neglect after two patients died after being given kidneys from a rough sleeping alcoholic infected with a deadly parasite

A doctor has been cleared of neglect after two patients died after being given kidneys from a rough sleeping alcoholic infected with a deadly parasite.

Father-of-six Darren Hughes, 42, and new grandfather Robert 'Jim' Stuart, 67, were given the kidneys at a hospital in Wales. Doctors had believed the alcoholic who donated them had died from meningitis.

But an inquest heard it was later discovered the man - referred to as Mr Z - in fact died from the parasitic worm halicephalobus gingivalis.

Despite the organs being rejected by surgeons at six hospitals around the UK, consultant surgeon Argiris Asderakis, 51, decided on his own judgement to take a 'calculated risk' and use them when they were accepted by University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.  

They were turned down elsewhere because of 'poor function' and the unknown cause of death of the donor. 

An inquest heard the two men died within three weeks of being given the kidney transplants. 

A coroner yesterday cleared Mr Asderakis of any neglect - and said no one could have predicted the kidneys were infected with a deadly parasitic worm.

Coroner Christopher Woolley said: 'There was no gross neglect or failure in accepting the kidneys.

'There is no test for this incredibly rare worm infection. These were the first deaths of this kind.

'Had it not been for the worm infection there is every indication the kidneys would have functioned and there is a likelihood both men would be alive now.

'I find the medical professionals cannot be criticised.'

Infections in humans are incredibly rare with only four cases previously discovered worldwide. All have proved fatal.

Both retired business developer Mr Stuart and father-of-six Mr Hughes died after contracting the nematode worm - in what was the first human to human transmission.

Acting Cardiff coroner Christopher Woolley said there were things that could have been done better by doctors, such as finding out the results of a second lumber puncture on the donor.

But he said that it 'remained unclear' whether that would have changed the outcome given that halicephalobus gingivalis is virtually unheard of in the medical profession.

The inquest also heard that there was nothing untoward in UHW transplant surgeon Dr Argiris Asderakis accepting kidneys from someone suspected of dying from meningitis.

NHS figures show that over the past 10 years there have been 52 patients with undiagnosed meningitis becoming organ donors.

In recording a narrative verdict, Mr Woolley said: 'Robert James Stuart ... (and) Darren Hughes died from the unintended consequences of necessary medical intervention.' 

Mr Woolley added that both Mr Stuart and Mr Hughes had given full consent for the transplants to go ahead and had been told about the donor dying from what was thought to be meningitis.

He said both men faced a 'significant risk of dying' on dialysis if they had not undergone the procedures.

The transplant operations were carried out at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff

However, relatives of the two dead men said their loved ones had not been in possession of the 'full facts' before agreeing to go ahead with the operation.

They were adamant they were not properly told about the meningitis link and the risks.

Speaking outside Cardiff Coroner's Court, solicitor Julie Lewis said patients must be more involved in decision-making, and they have to understand the risks and benefits.

'The families are very keen to get across to the public that the underlying issue here is this was an incredibly rare experience. People shouldn't be put off transplantation,' she added.

Ms Lewis said she had taken instructions from the families to pursue their cases with the General Medical Council as well investigate possible medical negligence claims. 

The inquest previously heard that donor Mr Z had a long history of alcoholism - and at one stage was drinking 240 units of alcohol per week.

The 39-year-old, who had cirrhosis of the liver, died in late November from a suspected viral infection.

His next of kin then agreed for his organs to be donated.

A string of hospitals declined the organs, before Cardiff's UHW took up the offer - with Mr Hughes and Mr Stuart getting one kidney each.

Transplant surgeon Dr Asderakis said it was commonplace in hospitals across the UK to accept organs under the so-called 'fast track' system.

'If you are excluding high-risk donors then you are excluding 11 per cent of all donors in the country - that's 1,500 transplants,' he added.

While the donor's cause of death was only given as 'suspected' meningitis or encephalitis, he was confident about taking the organ because Mr Z had undergone a five-day course of antibiotics.

The inquest heard that a post-mortem examination had not been carried out on Mr Z - but even if it had, it would have been incredibly unlikely that a test for the rare parasite was carried out.

Tests before Mr Z died showed that the meningitis had not been caused by common bacteria or viruses. Added to this, the deceased had not been abroad in the past six months - which reduced his chances of having an exotic virus.

However, the inquest heard that Dr Asderakis had not personally accessed the online database transplant surgeons sometimes use - the Electronic Offering System (EOS).

But he said he had been told all the information on the EOS via a telephone conversation with a specialist transplant nurse.

It also transpired that the results of a second lumber puncture on the donor had not been placed on the system - although coroner Mr Woolley reiterated that this would not have shed any light on the cause of his brain infection.

Both men died - two days apart - in mid-December 2013.

For father-of-three Mr Hughes, it was his third transplant, while it was Mr Stuart's first.

Mr Stuart's widow, Judith, believed her husband was coping very well on dialysis and would have been happy to stay on it for the rest of his life.

However, in his conclusion, Mr Woolley said both men's chances of surviving long term on dialysis given their circumstances would not have been high.

A Cambridge professor, who was part of a three-person panel asked to review the case, said that, while he would not have used the organs himself, no-one could have predicted the tragedy.

'I doubt we'll ever see (a case like this) again. No-one could have foreseen it.'
