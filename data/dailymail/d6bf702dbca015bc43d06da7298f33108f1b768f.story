Luxury Italian lingerie label La Perla has removed a mannequin displayed in front of its New York store, after a customer complained about its overly thin frame on Twitter.

The discovery was made at the brand's SoHo store on Sunday, by passing customer Michael Rudoy, who snapped a photo of the skeletal mannequin and uploaded it with the caption: 'How does #LaPerla think ribs on a mannequin is ok?!'

Within hours, a representative from La 
Perla swooped in and removed the offending object, claiming in a 
statement released on Twitter that it 'will not be used 
again by any La Perla boutique.'

Ribs on show: This mannequin (pictured) displaying jutting ribs and a concave stomach, was spotted by a customer in a New York store and promptly removed by La Perla following a Twitter outcry

'We are in
 the process of redesigning all La Perla stores with a new concept image
 and the mannequins that are currently displayed in our U.S. stores will 
no longer be used.'

'TERRIBLE!!!' responded one tweeter, from the Alliance for Eating Disorders in Florida, when the photo first emerged.

'It's not [ok] and I'm #NotBuyingIt' wrote another.

Mr Rudoy's friend, Seth Matlins, a former ad executive who is a self-described 'advocate for truth-in-advertising' also weighed in on the topic, praising La Perla for it fast response.

Skinny standards: La Perla's mannequins are typically very slender, with ribs also visible in this example, displayed in a different New York store front in 2011

'Was told by @LaPerlaLingerie, who replied/acted quickly, that the mannequin's been removed' he tweeted yesterday. An hour later, he tweeted again.

'Impressed by @LaPerlaLingerie commitment to change. We all make mistakes - it's if/how we fix them that counts.'

The luxury label, whose bras start at $98 and run up to over $300 each, has more than 100 boutiques globally.

And it's not just La Perla that has come under fire for promoting its clothing on stick-thin mannequins.

Psychotherapist Dae Sheridan was shocked when she came across a mannequin in a J.C. Penney store near her home in Florida in 2012, with matchstick narrow legs.

'We are in the process of redesigning all
 La Perla stores with a new concept image and the mannequins that are 
currently displayed in our US stores will no longer be used'

'The legs on the mannequin were not just “super-skinny”, they were extraordinarily, shockingly thin.  So thin, that the mannequin’s leg was the same size as my arm!' Ms Sheridan wrote in a 2012 online petition, which garnered over 7,500 signatures but was never addressed by J.C. Penney.

Gap, Zara and Club Monaco have also been lambasted for similar offenses in the past, with Spanish label Mango agreeing in 2007 not to display any mannequins smaller than a size 6, citing 'problems with eating disorders among Spanish women.'

MailOnline contacted a representative for La Perla and is expecting a response shortly.
