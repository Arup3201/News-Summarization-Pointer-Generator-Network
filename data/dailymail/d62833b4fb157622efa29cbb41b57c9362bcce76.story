Family fears: Chen Guangcheng, left, talks with U.S. ambassador to China, Gary Locke as they leave the U.S. embassy for a hospital in Beijing

Blind Chinese lawyer, Chen Guangcheng, who escaped house arrest and now is expected to leave his country for the United States, is concerned his relatives are now paying for the price for his freedom.

Authorities in his hometown have notched up restrictions on members of his extended family while he awaits permission in Beijing to travel abroad under an agreement between China and the U.S.

Chen’s nephew is under investigation over the stabbing of village security agents who entered his home in search of the fugitive.

His brother and sister-in-law have been placed under house arrest, and several other relatives face some form of restriction on their movements in their village in Shandong province, according to Chen, his lawyers and a rights group.

Chen's flight from abusive house arrest in Shandong and into the protection of U.S. diplomats — which led to an agreement with Beijing to let him study in the U.S. accompanied by his wife and children — has exposed the impunity of local officials and embarrassed the central government.

'I feel that Shandong's retribution against me has already started,' Chen said in an interview Thursday from a hospital where he is being treated for injuries suffered during his dramatic escape from his guarded farm house.

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Thursday the U.S. made inquiries with China and 'expressed our concern should there be any sense of reprisal.'

The woman who drove blind Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng to Beijing after his dramatic escape from house arrest told how she sat with security officers afterwards to watch the jailbreak movie, The Shawshank Redemption.

He Peirong said that five days after picking up Chen, she was taken from her home in Nanjing by state security officers 'to assist with investigations'. The officers interrogated her about whether she helped plan Chen's escape. 'They thought more than one hundred people were watching a blind man and they could let the blind man escape?'

In an odd twist, He revealed The Shawshank Redemption was showing on television in the hotel room where three security officers questioned her and Guo Yushan, a Beijing-based researcher and rights activist.    

He Peirong said she had received a surprise email from a source which read: 'The bird has left the cage. What do we do?'   'I understand. I'm in Beijing,' He replied. She was in the capital, meeting friends.    

By midnight the next day she had driven for six hours by car and arrived at the outskirts of Linyi city in Shandong. She was accompanied by Guo, but declined to give details on how many other people were in the car.      

There was no predetermined pickup point in Shandong, according to He, and when she and the others arrived, they searched for him.

When He picked Chen up after midnight, it was the first time she had met him. By that time, the combative, self-taught legal activist had scaled walls and made his way through fields and farmland without water or food for 17 hours, she said. In between, he had slept in pig pens and fields.    

He Peirong said she alerted US-based activists that they may need to seek help from the US State Department and members of Congress in Chen's case, and stayed in touch with them throughout.     

Chen's nephew, Chen Kegui, is 
believed to have been detained in relation to a clash with officials who
reportedly broke into his home after the activist's escape in late 
April.

The nephew's 
arrest notification allegedly says he is suspected of attempted 
'intentional homicide,' said Liu Weiguo, a lawyer who volunteered to 
defend Kegui but has yet to see the notification document himself.

Liu said at least one local Communist Party official was injured in the April 26 fight but no one died.

Local
Shandong police in the city and county overseeing Chen's village said 
they weren't aware of the situation with Chen's family. Communist Party 
publicity officials could not be reached.

Chen
has said a Chinese government official promised abuses he and his 
family suffered from authorities in Shandong would be investigated, but 
it is unclear if a probe has started.

The authoritarian government is often
mindful of not undermining or alienating local officials on whom it 
relies to enforce policies.

Police in the activist's town are searching for the nephew's wife and have threatened to detain his mother, Chen Guangcheng said.

'I hope that this issue gets some attention and that lawyers are able to meet the family and have the case entrusted to them,' he said.

'They won't let the lawyers enter the village and won't let them interact with the family. In turn, they are taking revenge on my family like this. It is simply too outrageous.'

The Chinese Human Rights Defenders 
network said around a dozen of Chen's relatives in the village of 
Dongshigu are under some form of house arrest.

'Even
when the international spotlight is on Chen, his extended family has 
been cut off from communicating with the outside world, and his nephew 
is in police custody,' said Wang Songlian, a researcher with the group.

'What is going to happen once the spotlight shifts? It is extremely worrying.'

Chen is expected to travel to the United States after China’s foreign 
ministry said it would accept his bid to study abroad. He has been 
offered fellowships at New York University and the University of 
Washington.

A self-taught legal activist, Chen 
gained recognition for crusading for the disabled and fighting against 
forced abortions in his rural community.

But he angered local officials and was convicted in 2006 on what his supporters say were fabricated charges.

After serving four years in prison, he then faced an abusive and illegal house arrest.
