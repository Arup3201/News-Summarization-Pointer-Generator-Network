Should you fall for PR razzmatazz, there was supposed to be only one star on ITV’s relaunched breakfast show this week: a brunette bombshell with a £1 million smile.

That was the mooted pay cheque dangled in front of Susanna Reid to defect from the rival BBC programme to host Good Morning Britain, a relaunch of the struggling Daybreak.

Famous for her sultry routines on Strictly Come Dancing and her flirtatious leg-crossing when interviewing guests, her appeal was confirmed this week when the lads’ magazine FHM listed her at number 30 in its Sexiest Women in the World list (12 places above ageing model Kate Moss — but nine below Nigella Lawson).

Yet amid all the talk about how good or bad the ratings are, a rather inconvenient reality has quietly emerged.

For the true star of the show is not Susanna, whose decision to wear a short, thigh-skimming yellow skirt on yesterday’s show was widely seen as an attempt to boost ratings — but an altogether more unassuming figure.

Step forward Charlotte Hawkins, a vicar’s daughter from Sussex, whose reputation has skyrocketed since she took her place on the sofa alongside Susanna and their male counterparts, Ben Shephard and Sean Fletcher.

On Monday morning, while her older colleague struggled with the autocue and was visibly angered by the inevitable glitches of a brand new show, Charlotte seemed to glide through with aplomb.

Not surprisingly, the reviewers — and viewers — noticed. And if these early signs are anything to go by, Susanna will have a battle on her hands.

Lorna Cooper, TV editor of the influential MSN website, was in no doubt. ‘Watched Good Morning Britain this morning,’ she tweeted. ‘Charlotte Hawkins seems far more comfortable than Susanna Reid; she’s been the star so far.’

The general consensus was that the programme needs more of Charlotte and there are already whispers about some tinkering with the format.

Monday’s debut of Good Morning Britain attracted an improved audience share, but numbers quickly dropped over the next two days, lagging 970,000 behind the BBC.

In a cut-throat fight, ITV’s bosses are desperate to prove they are not forever also-rans at breakfast-time, despite memories of the hapless relaunch in 2010 involving celebrity presenters Christine Bleakley and Adrian Chiles.

Viewers were initially disappointed to see Susanna Reid behind a desk along with co-hosts Sean Fletcher, Ben Shephard and Charlotte Hawkins

Indeed, Nick Owen, who was a relative unknown when chosen to present TV-am with great success in the Eighties, had predicted that audiences would be alienated by tales of presenters on stellar salaries.

And while the true size of Susanna’s contract is believed to be nearer £400,000 a year, ITV chiefs are keen to groom Charlotte, who earns less than a London head-teacher.

One fan told me of the former Sky TV anchorwoman: ‘It’s almost as if she was made for television. She is beautiful, has a stunning figure, is cool under pressure and is professional to a fault. This is a woman who gets into work half an hour early, even when her working day starts at 4am.’

Exactly the type of person that busy mums — the show’s target audience — can associate with.

Aged 38, Charlotte is only five years younger than Susanna, but her career path has been more of a steady rise, without resorting to the hoopla of a celebrity show such as Strictly Come Dancing.

Indeed, her early life was far removed from the bright lights of showbusiness. She was raised in a rambling vicarage in the village of Sidlesham in West Sussex, three miles south of Chichester, where her father was the local vicar.

However, Ms Reid's legs were soon on show to the nation with what has been described as her 'shrinking skirts'

Schoolfriends recall a good-natured, pretty girl with a zest for the outdoors. Her social life consisted of barn dances, singing in the choir, acting in the village panto and windsurfing with her older brother off the golden sands at nearby West Wittering.

From a young age, she set her heart on becoming a journalist, writing articles as a youth reporter for her local newspaper and then taking shifts at a hospital radio station.

Her other passion was the Girl Guides, graduating from being a Brownie and remaining a committed member until she left school. Such solid grounding gave her a sensible view of the burgeoning celebrity culture, telling Guiding Magazine many years later: ‘Far too many celebrities are unhealthily thin and ridiculously materialistic. Like most people, I buy a new dress and pair of shoes every now and again, but people should have a sense of proportion.’

Charlotte, who won the coveted Baden Powell Trefoil (the ultimate Guiding accolade), is unapologetic about her belief in the principles she learned as a teenager.

‘The whole ethos of Guiding is a good one to follow,’ she added. ‘It encourages honesty, reliability, politeness, cheerfulness and respect for others. These things are so important.

‘And I still do a good turn every day — whether it’s holding a door open for someone, helping someone with a pram up some stairs or just taking the time to talk to someone I meet.’

Such a belief in the merits of hard work saw her through a degree in English Literature at Manchester University, followed by a postgraduate degree in broadcast journalism at the London College of Communication.

Her professional career began in radio, followed by a stint at Meridian Television, where she rose from trainee to presenter of the main news. In 2007, she moved to Sky Television, where she presented Sunrise, the breakfast news programme, with Eamonn Holmes.

Meanwhile Charlotte Hawkins, right, has been a critical success with viewers during the high-profile breakfast show

An influential figure at Sky, the veteran presenter doesn’t suffer fools gladly (his description of Anthea Turner as ‘Princess Tippy Toes’ after a torrid time working on ITV’s breakfast sofa in the Nineties has passed into broadcasting folklore).

Yet in Charlotte he found a willing and able protegee. Ever eager to improve, she would arrive to work an hour and a half early, get a grasp of all the news stories of the day and be primed by the producers.

On one memorable occasion, the autocue went blank just as the titles rolled and the pair had to improvise. I’m told Eamonn just looked into the camera and said: ‘Here’s Charlotte Hawkins.’

‘She took over and did an amazing job. You couldn’t help but be impressed. I know Eamonn was,’ says a Sky insider.

Though part of her job means having to join the celebrity carousel (such as attend a charity dance event laid on by Sky TV), she remains hearteningly down-to-earth.

As for her personal life, Charlotte had been going out with Mark Herbert, now 40, a senior executive at drinks firm Pernod Ricard, for a decade before they married in 2008.

The ceremony was at Chichester Cathedral (thanks to her vicar dad’s links), with the guests ferried to the reception in a specially decorated vintage red double-decker bus.

ITV bosses are fearful that this week's expensive relaunch of their vital breakfast show will follow the earlier failure hosted by Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley

Home is a three-bedroom Fifties house in Surrey, which the couple bought for £700,000. Her husband wallpapered and fitted the bathrooms, while Charlotte painted the house herself.

They had previously lived in a one-bedroom flat in Teddington, Middlesex. A comfortable existence then, but hardly Beverly Hills.

One friend says: ‘Charlotte is a girly girl, not a big drinker. Anyway, with the ridiculously early hour she has to wake up in the morning, I can assure you she’s not out partying.

‘Sometimes, she’s a bit bewildered by any attention. Once, we were in a pub watching football on the TV when this bloke said to her: “Oh my  god! You’re that gorgeous girl off Sky.”

‘Charlotte just smiled, said hello  and then went back to watching the football. She prefers to live her life quietly and with a minimum of fuss.’

How different from Susanna Reid, who in recent months has been regular front-page news and celebrity magazine fodder following her split from her partner of 15 years, the father of her three children.

Away from the studio, Charlotte enjoys cycling, horse-riding and going for long walks with her dog, a terrier cross called Bailey she adopted from an animal rescue centre. In the absence of children (though they have certainly not been ruled out), she dotes on him.

Meanwhile, she spends much time concerned about the ailing health of her father, Francis, 77, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2011.

With her apprenticeship alongside Eamonn Holmes, Charlotte sees herself as a natural No 2.

But if audience reaction to Good Morning Britain is anything to go by, she could soon turn into a No 1.

Even in this age when only pushy divas seem to rise to the top, Charlotte Hawkins has the innate talent to prove that theory wrong.
