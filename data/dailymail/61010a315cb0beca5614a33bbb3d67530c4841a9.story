Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is close to leaving Cardiff City after their poor start to the season.

The Norwegian held talks with chairman Mehmet Dalman in London on Wednesday after Tuesday’s home defeat against Middlesbrough left them 17th in the table.

Sportsmail understands it is highly possible that Solskjaer will exit the club within the next 24 hours, though it is not yet a foregone conclusion.

Relations are also said to be amicable between the two parties, with the crucial factor being the side’s form.

Solskjaer has been given time and resources by the club since taking over in January in the wake of Malky Mackay’s messy dismissal.

He mounted only a weak challenge to keep Cardiff in the Premier League, the club finishing bottom having been 17th when Solskjaer took over.

And despite signing 17 players during his time at the club, results have not improved and they are currently are winless in four games. Alarmingly, their attendance of 19,711 for the Middlesbrough match was their lowest for a league fixture in four years.

Solskjaer accepted the blame after the defeat, saying: ‘I'm responsible and I should get better results than this; [better] than what we've had in the first seven games.

‘The first half was very poor, we got more second balls in the second half and we pushed them back, but we did not create any moments of quality to open them up which was very disappointing.

‘But confidence only comes from performances and results and without it you are unable to make those quick decisions in the heat of battle and it cost us.’
