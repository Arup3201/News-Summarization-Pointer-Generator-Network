This is the incredible moment an eagle soared from the top of the world's tallest tower to its owner on the ground in a record-breaking bird flight.

The imperial eagle, called Darshan, had a camera attached to its back as it swooped 2722 feet (830 metres) from the top of Dubai's Burj Khalifa.

It captured phenomenal views of the capital of the United Arab Emirates before landing on the arm of its trainer, falconer Jacques-Olivier Travers.

Freedom Conservation, the group which organised the attempt, claim it is the highest-ever recorded bird flight from a man-made structure.

The bird of prey captured phenomenal views on the Sony Action Cam Mini which was weighs about 300g and was attached to its back, before landing on the arm of its trainer, French falconer Jacques-Olivier Travers

The white-tailed eagle, which has been critically endangered for more than 50 years, has previously flown from the top of St Paul's Cathedral in London and the Eiffel Tower in France.

Ronald Menzel, director of Freedom Conservation, said the organisation filmed yesterday's bird flight in an attempt to draw more attention to eagle conservation.

He told the BBC: '[This] represents a historic opportunity for conservation – through these incredible images we are bringing this important cause to the attention of people all across the world.'

In the clip, which lasts nearly two minutes, the bird takes off from the tower and soars over Dubai, allowing the camera to record stunning aerial views.

The camera - a Sony Action Cam Mini - weighed approximately 300g, which is about 10 per cent of the bird's weight.

Upon landing on the arm of its trainer, Mr Travers could be seen punching the air with joy before describing the flight as 'perfect'.

He said: 'This was an incredible challenge and the most difficult of my career. 

'Not only is this the highest vertical flight that has ever been done, but the eagle also had to fly in a totally different environment, with strong wind disturbances caused by the skyscrapers.

'This flight will create huge possibilities for future conservation programs. 

Freedom Conservation, organisers of the bird flight, prepare by bringing the bird up to the top of the tower

'Training and equipping birds of prey with these small cameras will allow us to understand exactly what a bird does when it is released into the wild, and will ultimately help our effort to restore endangered bird populations.' 

Mr Travers developed his passion for birds at the age of 12, after being given small chicks from a nest.

He began training Darshan after selecting him from a breeding facility in Thonon, France.

Last year, he completed several successful big flights with his bird of prey including one from the Golden Gallery at St Paul's Cathedral to the base of London's famous Tower Bridge.

During the flight over central London in November last year, the eagle captured breath-taking footage of the capital and the River Thames with a high-spec camera mounted on its back.

At the time, Mr Travers said: 'I like to bring the birds where they are not expected. For many years, I have taught the birds to fly in nature using a paraglider.'

Views of Dubai captured by the imperial eagle will be used by the Freedom team to raise awareness of birds

The entire project was carried out by Freedom to try and raise awareness of birds of prey and extinction 

Darshan the eagle has previously soared from the top of St Paul's in London and the Eiffel Tower in France

In another impressive flight just a month earlier, Darshan soared from the top of the 206-metre observation deck of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France.

The bird was released from the inconic structure by its handler, before flying over the River Seine and down into the Trocadéro Gardens at 111 miles per hour.

Darshan is a white imperial eagle, a bird which was once on the Red List of endangered species but has since been saved from extinction.
