Gary Cahill has spoken of his disappointment at being benched for Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday.

Chelsea emerged successful after an enticing tussle with their Premier League rivals, with Branislav Ivanovic scoring four minutes into extra time for a 1-0 win on the night and a 2-1 aggregate triumph.

But England defender Cahill, who has been a mainstay in Chelsea's imperious back line since Jose Mourinho's return, was replaced by Kurt Zouma after Saturday's shock 4-2 defeat to Bradford in the FA Cup.

'I don't need to tell you how disappointed I was I wasn't playing,' Cahill said to talkSPORT on Wednesday. 'But the bigger picture is the team and getting to the final. It was a fantastic result.'

Cahill discovered on the morning of the game that he was to be replaced by Kurt Zouma, who offered an assured display alongside John Terry. 

The centre-back has not held court with Mourinho to find out specifically why he was excluded but knows he will always be able to have an honest discussion with the Portuguese manager.

'It was the morning of the game we found out. It is not about me, it is about the final, the team.

'Every game is different in his (Mourinho's) mind. We find out (the team) sometimes a couple days before, sometimes on the day. 

Cahill said he Mourinho's door is always open if he has an issue to discuss with him

'As professional players you deal with it, his door is always open. I don't think he feels the need to explain every single decision but he is approachable in that way, his door is open.'

Cahill will hope to return to the Chelsea fold for their Premier League clash against title rivals Manchester City at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.
