Troubled: George Hollis already had a lengthy criminal record before this week's charges for child pornography possession

A Texas man with a history of mental problems was found to have almost  two million child pornography images on his computer when his parents called 911 during a bi-polar episode, police said.

The family of George Hollis, 24, of Deer Park, called police last June because they believed he was high on drugs and having a mental breakdown because he was running naked through his home and around the neighborhood in only his underwear, KHOU reported.

It took federal agents months to uncover all of the images after the June 25 bust, a source told the station. He was hit this week with five separate felony child pornography possession charges.

Hollis mother said he ‘had been running through the house naked, punching holes in the wall, knocking pictures off the wall and running through the neighborhood wearing nothing but his underwear,’ police said.

The troubled man’s father added that he is bi-polar and self-medicates with cocaine and marijuana.

Police responding to the parents’ desperate plea for help began searching the home for drugs when they found the explicit images as they displayed on a screen saver, according to court documents cited by KHOU.

The computer monitors were inside a walk-in closet, and were hooked up to a computer with nearly two million images showing children between what experts believe are the ages of six and 16-years-old, a source told the station.

Officers quickly moved to obtain a search warrant as the manic man was taken to a local hospital.

Computers, external hard drives and USB drives were seized by the police as Hollis’ horrified parents came to grips with their son’s alleged depravity.

A relative told First Coast News that Hollis’ parents were devastated by the discovery.

‘If they would have had any thoughts [about that], they would have taken his computer away from him,’ said the uncle. ‘They're devastated.’

Police are confident, despite the 
staggering amount of child pornography discovered, that Hollis posed no 
threat to area children.

Out of control: Hollis' parents said they called the police because he was running around their home naked and punching holes in the walls before sprinting around the neighborhood in just his underwear

‘All the indications that we got were that he was strictly doing this stuff on the Internet,’ a Deer Park Police spokesperson told FCN.

It still didn't sit well with his neighbors.

'Two million pictures? That's an awful lot,' one said to KHOU with a look of disbelief on his face.

Hollis is sitting in Harris County Jail on a $150,000 bond, $30,000 for each of the five felony charges.

This is not his first brush with the law, records showed.

Hollis has three prior DWI convictions, the most recent in 2009 resulted in a six year home confinement and two year suspension of his driver’s license.

He has also been convicted of criminal mischief and marijuana possession.
