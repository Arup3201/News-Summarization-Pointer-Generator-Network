A British charity supported by Dame Judi Dench and Ricky Gervais is helping save the lives of hundreds of dreadfully injured and abandoned greyhounds in Spain.

Some of the dogs have been tortured – burned with cigarettes and acid – some dumped to die in tunnels, hung in trees or released on busy motorways. 

Others have been left with broken bones to starve to death. 

In at least one case, a rope had become so deeply encrusted in the neck of a greyhound it had to be surgically removed by a vet while dozens of others have had gaping, open wounds – the results of abuse - by the time they are found by volunteers across Spain.

Cruelty: Shocking pictures taken by vets and volunteers are held in the files of the Middlesex-based charity Greyhounds in Need (GIN), which is helping to save the lives of the injured and abandoned hounds

Suffering: ‘They are awful pictures,' said Martin Humphery of GIN. 'It is very disturbing but sadly typical of the kind of things that is going on. There is supreme neglect and cruelty on a large scale.'

Care: This  injured canine is pictured being cared for by GIN. Many of the rescued greyhounds have been found homes with families in Britain and across Europe

Hope: The charity has helped save and treat between 6,000 and 7,000 greyhounds since 1998

Tortured: Ropes tied around the necks of the greyhounds caused horrific injuries. Others had gaping, open wounds

Shocking pictures taken by vets and volunteers held in the files of the Middlesex-based charity Greyhounds in Need (GIN) show the scale of the problem that has seen the group help save and treat between 6,000-7,000 greyhounds since it was formed in 1998. 

Many have been found homes with families in Britain and across Europe - all treated by vets in Spain at shelters supported by the group. 

Disturbing new video recently obtained by GIN and filmed undercover in the Spanish countryside shows locally-bred hunting greyhounds, known as galgos in Spain, being held from the back of a pick-up on leashes and made to keep up with the vehicle as part of their training for blood-sport competition during the four-month long hare coursing season. 

When the video of the five greyhounds being ‘dragged’ from behind the truck was shown by GIN at the Royal Society of Medicine in London, there was outrage. 

‘They are awful pictures,’ said Martin Humphery, of GIN, ‘It is very clear that they are suffering greatly. 

‘We hope that it will finally help open eyes to the kind of abuse that is going on. It is very disturbing but sadly typical of the kind of things that is going on with these poor galgos. 

‘There is supreme neglect and cruelty on a large scale. 

'We have had cases of dogs being tied to rocks and left to starve to death, others with cigarette burns and some just thrown over fences and abandoned with broken legs.’ 

GIN works with a network of shelters across Spain where the primary rescue and treatments are carried out.

Abandonded: When the hunting season is over, the Spanish hunters often discard their greyhounds like ‘cigarette butts', rescue workers say, buying new ones for the next season

Neglect: Some of greyhounds are tied to rocks and left to starve to death, others  are burned with cigarettes and some are thrown over fences and abandoned with broken legs

It funds vets, treatment, shelters and care – and assists in finding homes with families of greyhound lovers in Britain, Italy, Belgium and France. 

Among those supporting the organisation, which spends around £250,000 a year on saving the dogs – funding comes mainly from donations and two shops on the South Coast run by the charity - is comedian Ricky Gervais, who has highlighted the plight and mistreatment of greyhounds around the world on Twitter. 

Oscar winning actress Dame Judi Dench, author Jilly Cooper and actor Peter Egan, a star of Downton Abbey – the owner of six rescue dogs - are among GIN’s heavy-weight patrons. 

Last month a shipment of eight dogs arrived at GIN’s kennels at Wraysbury, near Windsor, while they await adoption with their details posted on the organisation’s website.

In Spain, they had been treated at shelters, sterilised, micro chipped and have been tested and found clear of Mediterranean diseases before they come to the UK.

Not all are abandoned to die, some are left outside shelters because they are no longer of use and some merely dumped over the shelter fence – several broke bones in this way. 

Others are rescued injured and terrified from dog pounds, known to rescue groups locally as ‘killing stations'.

One dog was found  hanging from a tree while many are found with badly damaged legs caught in snare traps. 

‘We hear some dreadful stories of how the galgos are treated,’ Mr Humphery said, ‘The standard of care is very low, the hunting season takes place in very hot ghastly conditions and once that is over there is often little need for the galgos. 

'We are not just talking neglect but cruelty. Some have been tied up to rocks and left to starve to death.

Brighter future: Some greyhounds have been found and treated with the help of GIN but many, they say, have died fending for themselves

New homes: Eight greyhounds rescued by the charity are pictured here with kennel maid Dorie Laver. They are waiting to be rehomed

Justice: Prosecution for the mistreatment of animals in Spain is extremely rare and most people don't seem to 'care or worry' about it

‘We are thankful for the goodwill of some very dedicated Spanish people, who are often derided by the local community they live among because of their attitudes and work in trying to help the galgos.

‘Yes, Spain is in Europe but these are often very macho rural communities and the welfare of the dogs is not a priority. 

'It is a problem that national and local governments choose not to address. 

‘While some laws do exist concerning the mistreatment of animals, prosecution are extremely rare. It is just not something most people seem to care or worry about.’ 

One of the many cases highlighted by GIN, is that of is that of Fuga, ‘a lovely white galga’, (a female) that was found with a terrible slash in her neck from an incrusted rope in the Huelva area of Spain popular with tourists. 

A volunteer found her and she was treated – the cost picked-up by GIN. She made a full recovery and has been adopted by a family. 

‘It was a disgraceful case,’ said Mr Humphery. 

When the hunting season is over, the Spanish hunters often abandon their greyhounds like ‘cigarette butts,’ rescue workers say, buying new ones for the next season. 

The Spanish Galgo is said to be the only breed of dog that is capable of maintaining a constant and fast pace in a run or race that can last up to an enduring five minutes. 

Competitions are held nationally and locally with thousands hunting each year.

In one competition, the dogs are held at pace by a man known as a ‘soltador’ riding a horse. He then releases them simultaneously to chase the hare – although the galgo that kills it is not necessarily the winner. 

Dogs are awarded points for speed, overtaking, resistance, the tracking of the hare and the killing. 

The races, to be valid, must last a minimum of 55 seconds but can be as long as five minutes. 

The dogs can be disqualified if they behave in an irregular manner during the race. 

A galgo that does not follow the exact path of the hare and runs a shorter distance will receive penalty points and will not win. 

When this happens the Spanish say that the dog is ‘dirty’. 

Animal charities believe that at the end of the coursing season many dogs, even those chipped by owners and breeders, are abandoned and simply reported as ‘missing’. 

Some have been found and treated with the help of GIN but many, they say, have died fending for themselves.
