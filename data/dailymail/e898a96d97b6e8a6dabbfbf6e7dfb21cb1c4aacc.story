Liverpool is the home of the Liver Birds, the Albert Docks - and the UK's most promiscuous residents according to a new survey.

Research carried out by an online pharmacy specialising in sexual health found those from Liverpool were most likely to experience a one night stand.

According to the results, Liverpool topped the charts as the 'most promiscuous' place, shortly followed by Oxford and Newcastle.

Spontaneous passion: 61 per cent of those surveyed admitted to having a one night stand with a stranger

The study was conducted by www.UKMedix.com as part of research into the sexual health and preferences of Britons.

More than two thousand single men and women aged 18 and over from around the UK were surveyed.

Nearly half admitted they regularly have one night stands with those from Liverpool the most likely to do so.

Respondents who admitted to having 
regular one night stands were asked whether or not these were usually 
with people they knew or strangers - to which 61 per cent claimed that they were usually with strangers.

City of lovers: Those from Liverpool were found to be the most promiscuous according to a survey

Meanwhile, those in Cardiff were revealed to be the most 'sexually adventurous.'

Those taking part were asked to rate how 'adventurous' they 
were sexually, in terms of trying new things in the bedroom or sexual 
experiences 'outside of the norm' on a scale of one to 10.

Those from Cardiff were most likely to rate themselves as highly adventurous in the bedroom followed by those from Newcastle and Edinburgh.

Despite being the most 'promiscuous' in 
terms of one night stands, those in Liverpool only featured in tenth 
place on the 'adventurous' charts.

Furthermore, the study found that those 
in Southampton were revealed to be the least 'adventurous' sexually; 
rating themselves an average of just 1.5 on the adventure charts.

Sarah Bailey of UKMedix.com commented on the findings: 'We
 wanted to find out a little more about the attitudes that Britons have 
towards sex, particularly when it comes to adventure and suggested 
promiscuity. It seems that those in Liverpool are most partial to a one 
night stand, most likely with a stranger - yet despite this, those in 
Wales beat Liverpudlians in the adventurous charts! Whatever your sexual
 preferences, as long as you're safe and responsible, that's all that 
matters.'
