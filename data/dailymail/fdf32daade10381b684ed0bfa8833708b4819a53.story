Four world-class properties were placed on the market this year in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Point Piper, making one square kilometer the most enviable in the country.

The sales of the trophy residences in June, August, and most recently, on Friday, have elevated the North Shore suburb making it a millionaires row for a new set of owners.

Three of the properties went under the hammer for over $30 million, and the remaining property, formerly owned by Lachlan and Sarah Murdoch, is expected to fetch a tidy $37 million when it is snatched up later in the year.

There are high price hopes for the 110 Wolseley Road property, with anticipation that the residence will topple even the highest sales seen in the area over the past year.  

Selling agent Bart Doff from Laing+Simmons Double Bay said the property could sell for more than $37 million

The palatial master wing is connected a study, a bar and wine cellar, a butlers pantry, and marble-slab heated floors.

The house currently holds three bedrooms, with room to develop a further two, as the levels are connected by a bespoke glass-view elevator.

Selling agent Bart Doff from Laing+Simmons Double Bay said the property could sell for more than $37 million, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. 

Property developer and former next door neighbour Ron Medich pocketed the same amount earlier in the year for his 783 square metre Piper Point waterfront mansion.

The property is currently owned by Karyn Zamel, wife of mining engineer Gary Zamel, who plan to downsize within the area. The couple bought their home for $20.6 million in 2005, up from the $12 million the Murdoch's paid for the property the year they married, 1999. 

The three-storey mansion offers direct and panoramic views of the Harbour Bridge, and boasts its own private jetty and in-ground pool.  

Mr Doff said the home was 'one of the world's most prized private waterfront trophy holdings'.

This next property was built almost 40 years ago by the former property developer and hotelier, Salvatore Paino.

The site was bought for $135,000 and was built into a stunning five-storey property with five bedrooms.

The sale took three months of negotiations, and sold for over $30 million through Michael Dunn and James Dunn from Richardson & Wrench Double Bay in conjunction with Enza Messina from Enza Messina Real Estate.

The new buyers were reportedly deciding whether to renovate the well-loved property, or whether to rebuild on the site.

The house was originally placed on the market with hopes of a $40 million sale, but according to the estate agent, needs a lot of work.

The property occupies a forefront position, offering direct views of the Harbour Bridge which stretch from Double Bay to Manly. 

The property is set on 860 square meters with access via a private driveway, with the different living spaces flowing onto several wraparound terraces.

Boasting five bedrooms and six bathrooms (including two powder rooms), the mansion includes a luxurious master suite with terrace access, a walk-in wardrobe and a resort-style ensuite.
