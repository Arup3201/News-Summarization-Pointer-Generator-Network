Rosie O'Donnell returned to The View today for what is being billed as a new version of the long-running show. But apparently the cantankerous comedienne is up to her old tricks behind the scenes.

Sources at The View tell MailOnline that Rosie has already become a terror, only allowing the three new executive producers and co-hosts; Whoopi Goldberg and newcomers Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace, to communicate with her and making it clear to everyone in earshot, she's literally running the show. 

'She was at The View for several days last week, meeting with producers and telling them "how things are going to go". She has a definitive view of how she would like the show to go and wants everyone else to fall in line,' a show insider told MailOnline

She's baacck: 'Almost show time #theVIEW,' wrote Rosie, getting her make up done for her first live show today. 

Love you, mean it?  Newbies Rosie O'Donnell, Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace put their hands together for returning Whoopi. But show insiders say Rosie wants to rule the roost as moderator

Toeing the line: Rosie was sure to get a pedicure,  fearing her unkempt feet might draw attention from the show as she recovers from some sciatica. The first day of The View's new host lineup saw the return of the cantankerous former emcee after an eight-year absence

Last Wednesday, Rosie and new co-host Nicole Wallace did a test show with two fill-in hosts in an effort to build chemistry. Neither Rosie Perez or Whoopi Goldberg were present. 

Despite the fact that Whoopi is the regular moderator for the show, leading the discussion, Rosie took charge of the test show with Nicole.

'It was almost as though she was rehearsing for when she eventually takes over as moderator. It's clear that she would have preferred being in that capacity as she was before,' offered our source.

Rosie joined The View in 2006, replacing Meredith Vieira. 

But the following year Rosie and Elizabeth Hasselbeck had a heated exchange that got so intense producers cut to a split screen, something that Rosie despised. She walked off the set that day and never returned to the show.

But Whoopi was clear after Rosie complained several times in recent days: 'I'm moderating and that's how it's going to be, so work with me babe!'

'Rosie actually said aloud, "This is taking forever! I know we're on tape, but should it take 4 hours?"

'No one responds when she makes snarky comments except Whoopi, because everyone else fears for their job,' detailed the source.

The sentiment backstage after the test show was that the four co-hosts were 'boring together' and they were going to have to find some excitement before today's show.

But other than barefoot Rosie rubbing her tired tootsies, the magic wasn't there. Gawker called The View's tribute to Joan Rivers 'the worst ever.'

'I can hear Joan Rivers going, "Ugh!" over and over in her grave in response to this treacly tribute from Kristin Chenoweth on today's episode of The View, wrote Rich Juzwiak.

'Based on what happened in the test show, the only company that'll be sponsoring this show after next week will be AARP and any other brand targeting senior citizens. There's nothing magical about the chemistry with these four and the show just feels older,' the source added.

Rosie Perez apparently seemed overwhelmed by her experience at the tape shows and had this look of as though she was second-guessing her decision to sign on.

Whoopi continues to make jokes about how she can't wait until her contract is up and 'I wish ABC would just pay me to go home!'

In the end, it is clear that returning to The View was Rosie's redemption for how things ended first time after her unceremonious exit after an on-air spat with Elizabeth Hasselbeck.

Appearing for the first time on the panel today was token blonde Nicolle Wallace, who conservative credentials beat even Bush-loving Elizabeth Hasselbeck since Wallace actually worked for George W.

And in the third corner, the wildcard: known for her voice as much as for her no-holds-barred New York City attitude - actress Rosie Perez.

But don't expect too many screaming matches or claims that the world is flat (here's looking at you Sherri Shepherd): O'Donnell says the new View will be smarter, calmer and an all-around better show.

The live show began calmly, with introductions and a nod to creator and news media queen Barbara Walters, who held court from a throne and had her hand kissed by each of the hostesses, including the only one remaining from the previous season, Whoopi Goldberg.

'Welcome to the newer view,' joked Whoopi, before introducing Rosie O'Donnell.

O'Donnell kicked things off by catching up with viewers, including a discussion of her heartache and the gastric bypass surgery that followed.

Up next, an introduction of the other Rosie--actress Rosie Perez, who plugged her upcoming Broadway show and memoir.

Then came Nicolle Wallace: former George W. Bush press secretary for six years.

'I am a Republican, I should get that out of the way,' she said through a smile to audience uproar on both sides of the aisle.

Before things got too out of control, fiery liberal Rosie O'Donnell piped in: 'And I like her, I swear!'

True to form, though, the group jumped right into a contentious topic--the Ray Rice domestic abuse saga and further questions over child and sex abuse.

'All about money, all about the brand being jeopardized,' politico Wallace chimed in first on the Rice issue.

Perez agreed there's no excuse for hitting women, used her sports hero, convicted abuser Floyd Mayweather, to make the point that one's environment could be at fault as much as the individual.'[You] Respond the way you were taught,' said the actress.

But should one continue to support the likes of Mayweather and Rice by paying for event tickets? O'Donnell didn't think so.

'I haven't seen a Woody Allen movie since the allegations came out,' O'Donnell said, moving the conversation along to her own struggles with abuse. Though she did say she continues to appreciate Chris Brown as an artist, despite his violent past.

'O'Donnell!' replied the contestant.

'Wrong,' O'Donnell bellowed to the young lady's chagrin. 

Ask Me Anything: A new segment gave the ladies and their viewers some time to catch up and get to know the panel--for instance: Wallace hates Hillary, Rosie O'Donnell had a gastric bypass, Perez has a forthcoming memoir, and Whoopi, well, she's been enjoying her shoes

Another new segment came in the form of an audience participation game called Ro or Ro? where contestants must decide which Rosie is being described on a card

Loss but a win: While this episode's contestant lost Ro or Ro? with only one correct answer, the game did reveal a little known and astonishing fact about Perez--she practices tae kwon do!

 Perez and O'Donnell introduced a new audience participation game they will play each day together, a play on their identical names called Ro or Ro?

In the game, the audience members try to win a prize by deciding which Rosie does the thing being described on a card.

The show concluded with the tribute to Rivers that began with a song in the comedienne's honor by Broadway diva Kristin Chenoweth.
