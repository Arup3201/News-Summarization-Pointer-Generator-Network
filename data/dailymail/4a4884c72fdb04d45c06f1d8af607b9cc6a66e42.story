A 12-year-old with a lemonade and cookie stand in his residential area of Florida faces complaints from a neighbor who contacted police to report the stand as 'illegal.'

12-year-old T.J. Guerrero is a young entrepreneur who runs a lemonade stand in Dunedin, Florida to add to the income he makes from mowing-lawns so he can pay his cell phone bill and purchase an iPod.

Unfortunately T.J's neighbor Doug Wilkey has a problem with T.J.'s small business and has contacted police at least four times in two years to try and have it shut down.

The Tampa Bay Times reports that Wilkey says that the stand is 'illegal' and causes local problems like traffic, noise, and illegal parking.

'Please help me regain my quiet home and neighborhood,' Wilkey, 61, wrote to town officials.

'We're not in the business of trying to regulate kids like that; nor do we want to do any code enforcement like that,' said Dunedin planning and development director Greg Rice.

'We are not out there trying to put lemonade stands out of business.'

T.J. lives about four doors down from Wilkey but his lemonade stand is at neighbor Rodney Shrode's house directly next door to the 61-year-old complainer's home.

Wilkey lamented that T.J's friends are 'loud' and that they 'use profanity.'

Wilkey also complained that the $1 lemonade and $.50 could possibly make someone ill.

'The city could possibly face repercussion in the event someone became ill from spoiled/contaminated food or drink sales,' Wilkey said in an email.

'If this were a once a year event by a couple kids to earn a little money for a holiday or something, I would not have a problem with it. I am very worried about the value of my home, which is why I built in a residential area, not a business area,' he also said.

Deputy Wayne Gross asked local residents how they felt about T.J.'s lemonade stand and none of them seemed to have a problem with it.

A truck driver working on a project nearby told the Tampa Bay Times, 'I tried the strawberry before and it's perfect. That's what it's about. He's willing to work.'

T.J. says he isnâ€™t jilted by the conflict and told reporters he can't wait until he's 14 so he can apply for a bagging job at Publix.
