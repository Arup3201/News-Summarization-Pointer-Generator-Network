Vanished: Hany Nabil Mustapha, 46, was trying to sail from Poole, Dorset, to Hayling Island, Portsmouth when he disappeared. His body has now be found

The body of a businessman who disappeared at sea just hours after buying a new yacht has been discovered.

Hany Mustapha, 46, was reported missing on October 27 after setting sail from Poole harbour in Dorset with plans to meet his wife at Hayling Island in Portsmouth.

The 21ft vessel, Brigand, was found hours later unmanned off the coast of the Isle of Wight and an investigation was launched to locate Mr Mustapha.

His body was found four miles off Sandown and was identified by Dorset Police yesterday.

A spokeswoman for Dorset Police said: 'Initial identification of the body has confirmed it is that of missing London man Mr Hany Mustapha.

'The family of Mr Mustapha have been informed but formal identification has not yet taken place.'

Mr Mustapha, of Worcester Park, south west London, was last seen sailing out of
Poole harbour with his new purchase on Saturday - the day after he had 
celebrated his 46th birthday.

He was planning to travel 46 miles to Hayling Island, near Portsmouth, where his wife Liz, 44, was to join him the next day.

But
his yacht, Brigand, was found grounded on a sandbank with the engine 
still running and one sail up, near Brighstone, on the Isle of Wight, at 5.15pm
on Saturday.

Despite
an extensive search by coastguard helicopters and RNLI lifeboats, no 
sign of him was found and the search had been called off on Sunday.

Coastguards had received no distress signal from the Brigand and it is believed Mr Mustapha was wearing a buoyancy aid rather than lifejacket when he left the harbour.

An experienced yachtsman who is studying for his Master Yachtsman certificate, Mr Mustapha was a member of the Thames Motoring Yacht Club.

Mystery: 'Brigand', which Hany Mustapha had bought the same morning, washed ashore with nobody on board

Empty: Rescue services began a land, sea and air search after a member of the public found the boat

Mystery: The small boat was found on the Isle of Wight with its engine running and one of its sails still up

Described as ‘fit and active’ by his 
surgeon father Nabil, he was also a keen sportsman who cycled and played cricket and golf.

The
day before picking up the new yacht, he had celebrated his birthday at a
Chinese restaurant in Surrey with his wife, his daughter from his first
marriage, Nadia, 19, his parents, his sister May, 47, and her three 
children.

His family said he had been excited about collecting the boat and his trip to Hayling Island.

He had driven down to Poole after the meal so he could be ready to pick it up in the morning.

Mr Mustapha is thought to have paid £750 for the boat, a  21-foot pocket cruiser, that had been advertised on eBay.

Beached: The boat ran aground on the Isle of Wight. Rescue workers had searched an area around The Needles (pictured)

Mr Mustapha was director of several IT businesses and was described by his family as ‘very successful’ and ‘determined’.

His parents are of Egyptian origin but he and his sister were born in Aylesbury.

Neighbours in the cul-de-sac where Mr Mustapha lived described him as ‘always smiling’.
