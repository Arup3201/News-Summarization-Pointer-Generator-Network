Adnan Januzaj didn't choose the year he was born. He didn’t choose his precise place of birth. He didn’t choose the country, either. In the grand scheme of things, none of that matters a bean.

All that counts is that the Manchester United winger is freely allowed to choose whichever country he wants to represent.

England. Kosovo. Belgium. Turkey. Albania. It should be his democratic right to attach himself to the country of his choice. Instead, what we have at the moment is a 19-year-old kid being pushed and pulled in every direction by every international team with half a chance of nicking him for their senior side.

Take England. ‘We’re still in dialogue with FIFA,’ was the measured response from one of Roy Hodgson’s aides when England’s head coach was asked for an update on Januzaj’s naturalisation.

Seriously, you would have thought we were dealing with a hostage crisis, not the international aspirations of a Manchester United substitute.

There is a certain amount of sympathy for the predicament Hodgson finds himself in, even if he did direct a yorker at the feet of the FA board.

He wants a policy decision from the FA on this sensitive situation, something that may well come long after Hodgson has departed as England’s head coach.

Judging from the political noises in Kosovo, there are no such difficulties as they prepare to play their first international friendly, against Haiti, next month.

The tie is an emotional one, with Januzaj’s family involvement in the country’s bloody battle for independence in the nineties a key factor in their attempts to secure him. These are noble and honourable arguments, but a gruesome war, with its origins centuries old, should not influence his final decision.

Then there is Belgium, where Januzaj was born on February 5, 1995. On the basis of his birthplace, Marc Wilmots, the country’s international manager, has the greatest claim of all.

Which brings us to the ‘English is English’ debate, a phrase coined by Ray Clemence when he was talking about Manuel Almunia in 2008.

In FA Confidential, written by the FA’s former director of public affairs, it is claimed Sven Goran Eriksson wanted Carlo Cudicini (Italian), Steed Malbranque, Louis Saha (both French) and Edu (Brazilian) to represent the England national team.

Clemence was vehemently opposed to Cudicini’s selection, arguing the case for young, emerging English goalkeepers.

Back in 2008, Fabio Capello made it known he would consider Almunia, a Spanish national, if he acquired a British passport. England’s Italian-born manager did not want to push it publicly or privately, but he would have been considered for selection if he had become a naturalised citizen.

It was met with generational resistance, something Clemence, then England’s goalkeeping coach, spoke about at the time.

‘I am all for English goalkeepers in the England team,’ he said. ‘It’s as simple as that.’ Except it isn’t any more, is it? Taken in its purest form, this awkward phrase would mean discrimination at every turn. People would want proof that every Englishman had been born to the strains of Jerusalem in the delivery room.

Take Graeme Le Saux as an example. Ask 10 people around you where Jersey is on the map and the majority of them will struggle to stick a pin in right place.

But it doesn’t matter because Le Saux, who was born in the Channel Islands - St Helier, Jersey, in fact - went on to play 36 times for England.

Before he chose England, presumably because he was playing in this country at the time with Blackburn, he was also eligible to play for Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and France.

Tony Dorigo, a member of England’s 1990 
World Cup squad, was born in Melbourne, Australia. He qualified for a 
British passport under residency rules and opted to play for England. 
Dorigo’s father is Italian, his mother Australian. That is an example of
 the Januzaj principle and anyone who was around the England team at the
 time of Dorigo’s change of nationality will tell you that they didn’t 
bat an eyelid.

Still patriots: Lilian Thuram and Desailly were both born outside France but played for Les Bleus

Applied to other countries, little Odenke Abbey, born in Ghana in 1968, went on to lift the World Cup 30 years later with France. By then he had changed his name to Marcel Desailly and was widely acknowledged as one of the most accomplished central defenders in the history of the game.

Look at the pictures of Desailly, sent off with 10 minutes left to play in the Stade de France, celebrating with his team-mates at the final whistle. Lilian Thuram, the right-back, was born in Guadeloupe. Christian Karembeu was born in New Caledonia. Substitute Patrick Vieira was born in Senegal.

Over in Spain, the success story at Euro 2008 began with Marcos Senna, born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, lifting the trophy after Fernando Torres scored the winner in the final. Senna, who made 28 appearances for his adopted country, was the 40th naturalised player in Spain’s history.

In terms of international football, the lines are blurred by the increase in travel and the desire to experience life in other countries.

If Januzaj chooses to play for England, we may never discover the reasons why. Then again, it shouldn’t matter.

The 19-year-old can also play for Kosovo, Belgium, Turkey or Albania

Just because star was born in Belgium does not mean he has to play for that national side
