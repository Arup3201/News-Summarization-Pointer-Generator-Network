The number of patients spending more than four hours at accident and emergency departments in Wales has risen to the highest level in five years.

Nearly a fifth of all people arriving at A&E are facing waits in excess of the gold standard, four hours, as winter pressures continue their grip on the NHS.  

During the busiest December the health service has seen in five years, 81 per cent of patients were assessed, treated and then admitted or discharged within  within four hours of arriving at A&E.

Ministers, who have pledged to spend an extra £40 million to help the NHS deal with the surge in demand, blamed an increase in admissions.

Nearly a fifth of patients  at A&E are facing waits in excess of four hours as winter pressures grip the NHS in Wales with ambulances left queuing outside deparments, including that at University Hospital in Cardiff

Opposition parties have been fiercely critical of the new data - claiming it was further proof of the Welsh Labour administration in Cardiff Bay's poor record on health. 

The deputy minister for health, Vaughan Gething, praised the work of NHS staff during a period of immense pressure, with 76,889 people visiting emergency departments across the country.

But the figures laid bare the challenges facing the health service, with 2,490 people waiting longer than 12 hours to be seen.

The number of people attending A&Es in December was up 2.5 per cent on December 2013.

And it marked the highest number of attendances per day in any December since 2009. 

Mr Gething said: 'These figures show eight out of 10 people who went to A&E were assessed, treated and then admitted or discharged in less than four hours during December.

'While different reporting mechanisms make it difficult to make direct comparisons with other parts of the UK, it is clear all health services are experiencing significant pressures.

'I would like to thank everyone within the Welsh NHS for their unrelenting commitment to patient care during this difficult period.

'We have announced an extra £40 million to help the NHS deal with winter pressures.

'This means we have invested a further quarter of a billion pounds in the Welsh NHS in 2014-15 to continue to deliver high-quality, sustainable health services.' 

The best-performing A&E department was Bronglais in Aberystwyth, with 90.7 per cent of people seen within the four hour target window. Wrexham's Maelor hospital had the lowest figure at 65.6 per cent.

The news comes in the same week a senior Welsh nurse described the pressure on A&E staff as more stressful than treating soldiers on the front line in Iraq.

Welsh ministers have pledged an extra £40 million to ease the pressures but Conservative politicians in opposition have said the move is 'too little too late'

The Welsh Conservatives, the second largest party in the Welsh Assembly, said Labour ministers needed to set out swift and detailed plans to turn the situation around.

Shadow health minister Darren Millar said: 'December's atrocious performance is among the worst since current records began and it confirms that patients and staff are paying a high price for Labour's record-breaking cuts to the NHS budget.

A senior nurse working in A&E at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff gave a brutal account of life on the front line of the NHS.

Having treated injured soldiers during the second Iraq war in 2003, the nurse, who was not named, claimed the pressure staff are facing in A&E at the moment is worse than that in a warzone.

Extracts from her three-page account of one shift, which was pinned to a staff noticeboard in the hospital and leaked to the press, reads: 

'Arrived at 7pm to a department of 60 patients, 43 to be seen. Most areas of A&E are full and no beds allocated. 

'There were five ambulances outside with 15 presented majors patients to be triaged. Throughout the night we had 125 patients through, on top of the 60 to begin with.

'Young pregnant woman was bleeding heavily. On walking into the triage room, she miscarried

on the floor and passed the foetus at the feet of the triage nurse. 

'We had nowhere private to take her and had to pick up everything from the floor in front of her and scoop it into a pot.'

'Arrival of ambulance crews was relentless overnight and we had multiple offload delays. 

'In order to avert long delays, I had to think about what patient I could offload and what

patient absolutely needed to stay on a truck and have continual monitoring.'

'The existing targets have not been met in well over five years and lie significantly behind performance in England.

'This week's announcement of £40 million to support winter pressures in Wales was too little and too late.

'Another NHS bailout at the 11th hour does not allow Health Boards to plan properly for effective spending and it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the frontline in the current bleak mid-winter.'

Plaid Cymru AM Elin Jones countered Welsh Government suggestions the latest failure to meet A&E target times were because of an increase.

She said: 'Demand for services has been within a consistent margin for many years.

'It is clear therefore the failure to meet these targets is not down to the number of people coming through the door, but indicative of a deeper problem that lies in the flow of patients through hospital.'

Ms Jones added a major recruitment drive for more doctors was desperately needed.

Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams said: 'Anyone who read the letter from the A&E nurse, who compared working in a Welsh A&E to working in a war zone, would be moved by the dedication and commitment of our NHS staff.

'However, they are being held back by the Welsh Labour Government.

'What is clear to me is that the NHS is too big an issue to be left to one party. What we need is a cross-party and no-party commission, working with health professionals and patients, to look into the future of our NHS and how it can meet the severe challenges it faces in the future.'

The NHS in England has the same 95 per cent target as Wales but its figures are published weekly during winter. 

Today the figures covering the week until January 11 revealed 89.8 per cent of people were seen within four hours across England.
