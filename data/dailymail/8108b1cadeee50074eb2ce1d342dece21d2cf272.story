Appropriately for the current heatwave, a large cloud in the London sky turned into a striking resemblance of the African continent. 

The photographer was amazed when he looked up and saw the cloud looking uncannily like Africa over Brockwell Park in South London.

Complete with the Horn of Africa, the northern peak of Tunisia and iconic curve of western Africa, the cloud complimented perfectly the sun-baked grass beneath.

However, within just a few seconds the formation began to break up and all trace of it was gone.

Clouds form when humid air cools enough for water vapour to condense into droplets.

Their formations are usually classified into four basic categories, but this one formed a unique shape of its own.

It is likely to be a type of cumulus cloud, which appear in fair weather.

Clouds shaped like countries are a popular phenomenon for photographers.

Sue Strang, 44, was amazed when she spotted two clouds shaped like the British Isles while walking with her husband last year.

'We were out walking and as I looked in the sky I suddenly saw the clouds, so I grabbed my mobile to take a photo,' said Sue, from the Isle of Man.

Another map of Britain was spotted in Cyprus by British holidaymaker Martin Dodd, who photographed it from his car.
