Vending machines are usually synonymous with four finger KitKats and watered down hot drinks.

But two beauty masterminds have given the classic treat dispenser a much-needed glamorous makeover and launched the BeautyMART vending machine full of girly gifts from face creams and nail varnish to makeup kits and emergency beauty supplies.

The revolutionary beauty machine, which has landed in the plush new BeautyMART boutique  cosmetics hall in Harvey Nichols, London, features best-selling and iconic products chosen from premium, niche, and mass brands from Bourjois to Elizabeth Arden.

It's here: The very first beauty vending machine has landed at the BeautyMART in Harvey Nichols and dispenses plenty of beauty treats from face cream to nail varnish

BeautyMART dispenses individual beauty bags which each have a theme and range in price from £3.45 to £98 so there is something for beauty lovers on all ends of the budget.

There are 32 bags to chose from and those on the lower end of the price scale are filled with girly essentials such posh tampons by Trinkets right up to the most expensive bag containing luxury Dr Jackson's 01 Cream and Paul Yacomine's No 1 Hair Oil.

Beauty and brains: The machine is the brainchild of Anna-Marie Solowij, the former beauty director of Vogue and Millie Kendall, a beauty brand creator

For anyone rushing off to a date and lacking a few added extras, there's a Love and Peace bag which contains Jurlique Love Balm and Nadia Narain 
Peace Candle, as well as a Fashion Emergency bag filled with Miss Oops Mishap Tape and 
Rescue Sponge.

There is also a clubbing kit with Bourjois volume clubbing mascara, 
Model's Own Wah Nails nail transfer and mini Batiste dry shampoo.

If you're a girl going for the retro look and need a quick fix, there's a vintage glamour bag 
complete with Eyelure false lashes and red lipstick.

There are also bags containing single products like a GlamGlow face mask (£50), Kahina Argan 
Oil (£74) and Elizabeth Arden 8 Hour Cream (£25).

The BeuatyMART vending machines are the brainchild of Anna-Marie Solowij, the former beauty director of Vogue and Millie Kendall, a beauty brand creator and retail maven who's worked with Aveda, Tweezerman and Ruby & Millie

Speaking about their mastermind, the pair said: 'After 20 years each in the industry, discovering, writing about, creating and selling some of the best beauty products around, we have put together a selection of our all-time favourites, as well as some exciting new finds, and we’re selling them in BeautyMART, our new boutique in Harvey Nichols.

'We know that a beauty editor’s opinion is important to consumers so we are bringing the power of editorial to retail.'

Pricey: The more expensive items on sale are GlamGlow's face mask (£50) and Kahina Argan Oil (£74)

The duo have plans to roll their creation out to art galleries, night clubs, 
train stations and each vending machine will have a different theme and edition of bags depending on 
where they are situated.

And in true fashionista style, there will definitely be new bags added and the 
edits will be ever evolving.

Beauty blogger Charlie Lankston said: ‘The BeautyMART vending machines are the ideal solution for on-the-go beauty lovers looking for a quick fix.

'There are so many times when I have been caught on the hop without some of my favourite beauty essentials, particularly when travelling late in the evening when shops are shut, and have been desperate for a couple of core items like mascara or blusher.

'The BeautyMART machines could put an end to all that stress and worry and ensure that you can always look your best, wherever you are.’
