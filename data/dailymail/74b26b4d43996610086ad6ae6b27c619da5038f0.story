When Louis van Gaal was dissecting his Manchester United managerial debut on August 16, he insinuated the 2-1 defeat against Swansea City  was just a symptom of teething problems.

'We have to remember that it is just one game of many games and you shall not be champion in this moment but in May,' he added, having just been baptised a Barclays Premier League manager.

That opening day defeat reeked of same old, same old from the season before yet, with the reverse fixture  at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday, Van Gaal can no longer turn to the same excuse.

A poll by the Manchester Evening News found  81 per cent of Manchester United fans back Louis van Gaal

Expectations have dwindled at Old Trafford.

Going into that game against Swansea in mid-August, supporters wanted proof  they were ready to challenge their noisy neighbours for the Premier League title. Instead they realised a slick public relations campaign and the appointment of an iconic manager don't make for a quick fix.

More than six months on, they're third – 12 points behind Chelsea and five off Manchester City –and their lack of progress in a title challenge has made Champions League qualification a must.

Most supporters are content with that, and why not?

The horror show of the year before under David Moyes saw United lose their place among Europe's elite and if Van Gaal can right that wrong, then that's a significant improvement.

This was backed by a poll in the Manchester Evening News which found 81 per cent of supporters approved of Van Gaal's first season in charge, 12 weeks ahead of the May finish.

When put to the manager, he said, tongue in cheek: 'Over 80 per cent? Unbelievable. In spite of your [the media’s] criticism, fantastic. Thank you. I can repeat it, more than 80 per cent.'

Fail to qualify for the Champions League, however, and watch that number spiral.

United have lost just four games in the Premier League this season, and are on a run of one defeat in 19 games. Yet their results, without a doubt, have been better than the performances. 

Take, for example, their latest Premier League win. A 3-1 victory against second-bottom Burnley on February 11 was expected, but flattering to say the least. As was their 2-1 win over Arsenal on November 22 and their 2-1 win over Southampton on December 8, among others.

Offer supporters one defeat in 19 games, a place in the FA Cup quarter-finals and  third in the Premier League before that Swansea opener, however, and  most would snap your hands off.

The ends are justifying the means, yet  there has not been a game this year where rival supporters, namely those at the Etihad, sit back and think: 'Uh oh, they're back.' 

Even Paul Scholes reckons it's been miserable.

Supporters pay good money to be entertained, to watch attacking, creative, free-flowing football, not to be on edge. As the reverse Swansea fixture arrives, this has been in short supply.

Even with the £153million influx of Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo, Angel Di Maria, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera, and, for one season, Radamel Falcao.

In trying to establish United as the monster they once were under Sir Alex Ferguson, questions have been thrown Van Gaal's way, just as they were when he was manager of Barcelona between 1997 and 2000.

His three-year reign in Spain was filled with skepticism about his tactics, decisions and philosophy. At the Nou Camp he dropped Rivaldo – a Brazilian genius and 1999 Ballon d'Or winner – and was hounded about it  by the Barcelona media. A friction that ultimately led him to the exit.

It hasn't been all too different in Manchester. The questions keep arriving.

Why, for example, waste Wayne Rooney in midfield? Are you finished with the partnership of Robin van Persie and Falcao? What's happened to Herrera – your first purchase at £29m? Why persist with the 3-5-2 formation? Is your relentless side-to-side football limiting Di Maria's influence? And so on. 

Yet there appears method in Van Gaal's madness. Their extraordinary run of having only lost against Southampton since November 3 is no fluke. Luck does not carry a team that far, and it will worry  Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Southampton and Liverpool to see a side playing average but winning.

On Saturday, in Swansea, Van Gaal can exact revenge for that August 16 defeat.

'We shouldn't forget a lot of my players in the first match were not there. Marcos Rojo wasn't there, Daley Blind was not there, Angel Di Maria was not there, Luke Shaw was not playing,' he says in mitigation. 'It's another match.'

That it is. It may not be to keep them in the running for the Premier League title with Chelsea and Manchester City, but Van Gaal can ill afford to miss out on Champions League qualification. 

Progress under their new manager is being made but time waits for no man, not even him.
