Happy World Menopause Day! There won't be a parade and there isn't a fun dress code but the World Health Organisation has designated October 18th as World Menopause Day in a bid to inform more women about menopause and its impact.

Our ageing population means that more women than ever are entering menopause and suffering the effects, often in silence because of embarrassment or a lack of information..

62-year-old Kathryn Colas suffered from Vaginal Atrophy in silence for years and said it almost destroyed her marriage

One of the most common and debilitating side effects of menopause is Vaginal
Atrophy (VA) - also known as vaginal dryness. A survey commissioned by 
the British Menopause Society has revealed that 45% of women who have 
reached the menopause have suffered from VA and 70% of those women say that their sex life has suffered drastically as a result.

VA can have disastrous consequences for sex lives, relationships 
and marriages as well as the physical and mental health of women and although treatment is easy diagnosis remains tricky because it is such a taboo subject for many doctors and their patients.

Today on This Morning 62-year-old Kathryn Colas appeared on the sofa with the show's resident doctor Dr. Chris Steele to talk about the impact VA had on her life, and try and help raise awareness.

She said: 'It started in my 40s when using tampons became painful.

'Gradually sex was very painful, it was like a carpet burn.

'I was always too embarrassed to talk to my husband and he started to say it was like sleeping with a stranger. He felt very isolated and we started rowing about it.

'I was too embarrassed to go to the doctor too.

'I did my own research and found out that what I was feeling had a name, it was Vaginal Atrophy, I thought "that is me"!'It is life changing, going from being a 
jibbering idiot thinking there is something very wrong with me to finding out
that this is just a symptom of the menopause.

'And the remedy is so very simple. It is magic. It is transforming.

'My husband used to say "I just want my wife back," I used to say "I just want my life back!".'

The graphic by Novo Nordisk shows how Vaginal Atrophy affects both men and women, it was created as a result of a survey of 4000 women of menopausal age

WHAT IS VAGINAL ATROPHY

Before
the menopause the skin and tissues around the vagina are kept supple 
and moist by fluids and mucus. These are made by glands at the neck of 
the womb. Oestrogen (the female hormone) affects these glands. Oestrogen
also affects the tissues in and around the vagina, causing the lining 
of the vagina to be thicker and more elastic. Oestrogen also stimulates 
the cells that line the vagina to produce glycogen, a compound which 
encourages the presence of helpful bacteria which protect the vagina 
from infection.After the menopause the ovaries make less 
oestrogen. The lack of oestrogen leads to thinning of the tissues around
the vagina and a reduction in the number of glands that make mucus. You
also lose some fat tissue from around the genital area. This may make 
the area also look slightly different than before the menopause.In
summary, the hormonal changes make the vagina shorter, less elastic and
drier. The genital skin also looks paler. These changes usually take 
months or years to develop after the menopause and vary from woman to 
woman. Atrophic vaginitis is the medical term for the condition when 
these changes produce troublesome symptoms.

THE SYMPTONS OF VAGINAL ATROPHY

The
changes described above can occur without causing any symptoms or 
discomfort. However, some of the following symptoms may develop in some 
women.

HOW TO TREAT IT

Not
all women have all of the above symptoms. Treatment may depend on which
symptoms are the most troublesome. Because the problem is mainly due to
a lack of oestrogen, it can be helped by replacing the oestrogen in the
tissues.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)This
means taking oestrogen in the form of a tablet, gel, implant or 
patches. This may be the best treatment for relieving the symptoms, but 
some women don't like the idea of taking HRT. There are advantages and 
disadvantages of using HRT. See separate leaflet called 'Menopause and 
HRT' for more detail.

Oestrogen creamsSometimes
a cream, pessary or vaginal ring containing oestrogen is prescribed. 
This restores oestrogen to the vagina and surrounding tissues without 
giving oestrogen to the whole body. Usually the treatment is used every 
day for about two weeks, and then twice a week for a further three 
months. After this the effect of the treatment may be assessed by your 
doctor. This treatment usually works well but the symptoms may recur 
some time after stopping the treatment. Repeated courses of treatment 
are often necessary. It is important to follow the instructions about 
the amount of cream to use.

Lubricating gelsIf
vaginal dryness is the only problem, or hormone creams are not 
recommended because of other medical problems, lubricating gels may 
help. There are two gels which are available in the UK that are 
specifically designed to help the problem of vaginal dryness. They 
replace moisture. They are Replens® and Sylk®. You can buy these from 
the pharmacy and your pharmacist should be able to advise you.
