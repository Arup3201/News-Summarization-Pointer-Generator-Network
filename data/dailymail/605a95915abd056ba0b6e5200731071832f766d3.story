Consumers are mistakenly buying cheese made from imported milk because of confusing labelling, the Environment Secretary is warning.

Elizabeth Truss said current rules meant shoppers could be misled into believing they are supporting farmers in this country by choosing dairy products made from British milk.

In fact, cheap milk is often brought in from other countries and simply processed here.

EU rules are allowing cheap-skate manufacturers to import cut price foreign milk before processing it into cheese in this country, then labelling it with a Union Jack giving the impression it is a British product

Miss Truss said she was demanding a change to EU rules which allow Union Jacks and other branding suggesting products are homegrown to be displayed on such products.

‘People place a premium on buying British food, but at the moment you can’t always be sure the cheddar you’re buying is made from British milk – even if it looks like it was,’ the Cabinet minister said.

‘That’s why I want to introduce better country of origin labelling for dairy products so people can be reassured that when they buy British cheese it’s made from British milk.

‘I want to see more British dairy products on our shelves. We currently import two-thirds of our cheese, much of it Cheddar that could be produced here.’

Farmers have complained about Lidl’s Valley Spire cheese – saying both British and imported cheeses are packaged with the same branding and sold at the same price.

Another widely-sold product, with the British-sounding name Pilgrim’s Choice, is made from milk produced in the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.

Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said the rules were confusing consumers and is calling for a change in the law

Britain has had a voluntary industry scheme for labelling since 2010.

But at the moment there are no mandatory country of origin rules, and only around two thirds of milk, cream, butter and cheese products are produced in compliance with the voluntary code.

The Environment Secretary has had meetings with EU Commissioners to press for a change to labelling rules. A Brussels report is due to be produced within months on a change in the law.

The Government is also encouraging firms to volunteer the origin of the liquid milk used in dairy products so consumers are being given clear information about where a product originates.

Britain’s dairy industry is in desperate need of consumer support, with dozens of farmers quitting the industry each month.

Milk prices around the world have fallen by more than 50 per cent over the past 12 months, as producers in the US and New Zealand have been ramping up production.

In the UK, the big supermarkets have launched a price war, which has led to the price of a four-pint carton of milk tumbling from around £1.39 to £1 in Tesco and Sainsbury’s. Stores insist that recent price cuts do not affect the price they pay farmers.

The National Farmers Union says the number of dairy farmers had dipped below 10,000 for the first time, a 50 per cent fall since 2002.

It forecasts that fewer than 5,000 dairy farmers could be left in the UK by 2025, if current rates of decline continue.

The union said: ‘It should be easy for the consumer to identify and buy British cheese made with assured British milk.’
