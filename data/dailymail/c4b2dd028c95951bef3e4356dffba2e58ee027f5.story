A Canadian mother says she is 'humbled' by the fact that thousands of people around the world claim she inspired them to vaccinate their children.

Jennifer Hibben-White wrote a diatribe against vaccine-hesitant parents last week after a hospital said her 15-day-old son had been exposed to measles as he waited for a check-up on January 27. 

Tomorrow a doctor is expected to give baby Griffin the all-clear, DailyMail.com has learned.

During the tense four-week wait, Mrs Hibben-White took to Facebook, slamming 'misinformed' parents for 'twisting science', adding: 'I am angry as hell.'

The post, which systematically lists and debunks the various myths surrounding vaccinations, has been shared more than 270,000 times since February 10 - and thousands of parents from as far as New Zealand, Australia and the Netherlands have been moved to reassess their stance.

Speaking to DailyMail.com from her home in Pilkington, Ontario, Mrs Hibben-White said: 'It has been quite overwhelming. I had to stop reading the messages by the time it passed 200. I've now had thousands.

Furious: Jennifer Hibben-White and her husband Glenn are furious after being told 15-day-old Griffin could have been exposed to measles while waiting for a routine check-up at an Ontario hospital last month

'People all over the world who were on the fence emailed me saying they saw my post and it made them look at the data for themselves, make an informed decision, and vaccinate their children.

'I never expected it to go around the world like it did. 

'It was a very upsetting and stressful tome and I think I'd just kind of had it at that point.'

Mrs Hibben-White, a vice-president of marketing at a private school, and her husband, Glenn White, have rebuilt their lives since their five-year-old daughter Olivia unexpectedly died in her sleep three years ago. 

Tests showed she suffered from a rare blood infection. 

Describing the ordeal to DailyMail.com, Mrs Hibben-White said the phone call from York Region Public Health about Griffin was the last straw. 

'We have gone through a lot as a family over the last few years. 

'This was a tipping point where I felt that the responsibility of people had to be addressed.'

But despite the positive reactions she has had, the fear surrounding vaccinations does not appear to be waning.

'I have heard so much misinformation over the past few days that it is really frightening. 

'I am talking about celebrities who make connections between vaccinations and autism. We need to start being smarter. 

'It is a simple case of education; talking to the right people such as the family doctor, reading established peer-reviewed sources such as those from the World Health Organization. It's all about mitigating risk. 

'What would happen in an epidemic? Now it's measles. What about mumps? Polio?'  

After a tense four-week wait, the family will visit a doctor tomorrow to find out if baby Griffin is measles free.  

In the post Mrs Hibben-White wrote:

Agonizing wait: The family has to wait three more days to hear if Griffin is infected with the disease

Further fears: Their three-year-old daughter Aurelia only has one MMR jab which they hope will protect her

'You think you are protecting them by letting them eat their shovel full of dirt and reducing antibiotics and eating organic? You aren't,' she wrote. 

'And you would be the first to line up if you had an inkling of what the death of a child feels like. 

'You would be crawling through the streets on your hands and knees, begging, BEGGING to get that vaccine into your precious babies.'

She continued: 'You think you are protecting them through extracts and homeopathy and positive thoughts and Laws of Attraction and dancing by candlelight on a full moon? You aren't. 

'I PROTECT YOUR CHILD. We protect your child. By being concerned world citizens who care about ourselves, our fellow man, and our most vulnerable. So we vaccinate ourselves and our children.' 

More than 100 people in California and others in several states and Mexico have been infected with measles since an outbreak traced to Disneyland was first reported in December.  

A Center for Disease Control statement said that it has been dealing with a large, ongoing multi-state outbreak since the beginning of the year.

Though the vast majority of cases are in California, 18 states and Washington DC had seen cases as of Tuesday.

Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington have seen patients with measles.

Political figures have weighed in on the issue of vaccination, with President Barack Obama saying that there is 'no reason' for all parents not to have their children immunized.

The year 2014 saw a record number of measles cases, with 644 patients across 27 states.

Last year had one major outbreak that consisted of 383 cases in the unvaccinated Ohio Amish community.

The US normally sees less than 100 measles cases a year. 

This is my son Griffin, and he may have measles.

On February 9th, I received a phone call from York Region Public Health, informing me that Griffin, alongside my mother and I, was potentially exposed to the measles virus while attending a newborn weigh-in appointment at my doctor's office in Markham on January 27th.

Griffin was 15 days old at the time.

I was informed that someone who later developed measles sat in the doctor's waiting room between 1 hour before and 30 minutes before we arrived. I was also informed that measles is regarded as 'airborne' and can stay in the air and on surfaces up to 2 hours after the infected person has left.

I was then asked if I had had the measles vaccine. I had.

Griffin. Griffin had not. Can not.

I was advised to not be around small children. If I worked in such an environment I would be written off work. I do work in such an environment; my home. Where I now sit with Griffin and my 3 year old, Aurelia, who has only been able to get one MMR vaccine so far. She is now, technically, exposed too. 

We are to sit tight and watch for symptoms: fever, cough, runny nose. If we develop any of these we are to call my doctor and arrange to come in under official medical precautions. We are to wait at home, in isolation, until February 17th, after which the 21 days of possible incubation will have passed and we are clear.

So, Griffin is now Schrödinger's baby. Simultaneously with measles, and without it. Until he develops symptoms, or until a further 7 days pass. One or other.

And I'm angry. Angry as hell.

I won't get angry at or blame the person in the waiting room. I would have likely done the same thing...you get sick, you go to the doctor. I have no idea what their story is and I will never know. But I do know one thing:

If you have chosen to not vaccinate yourself or your child, I blame you.

I blame you.

You have stood on the shoulders of our collective protection for too long. From that high height, we have given you the PRIVILEGE of our protection, for free. And in return, you gave me this week. A week from hell. Wherein I don't know if my BABY will develop something that has DEATH as a potential outcome.

DEATH.

Now, let's unpack this shall we. All out on the table.

You have NO IDEA what this 'potential outcome' means. NO IDEA. I do. Unfortunately, I do.

You think you are protecting your children from thimerosal? You aren't. It's not in their vaccine.

You think you are protecting them from autism? You aren't. There is no, none, nada, nothing in science that proves this. If you want to use google instead of science to 'prove me wrong' then I am happy to call you an imbecile as well as misinformed.

You think you are protecting them through extracts and homeopathy and positive thoughts and Laws of Attraction and dancing by candlelight on a full moon? You aren't. I PROTECT YOUR CHILD. We protect your child. By being concerned world citizens who care about ourselves, our fellow man, and our most vulnerable. So we vaccinate ourselves and our children.

You think you are protecting them by letting them eat their shovel full of dirt and reducing antibiotics and eating organic? You aren't. As an unvaccinated person you are only protected by our good graces. WE LET YOU BE SO PRIVILEGED thanks to our willingness to vaccinate ourselves and our children.

You know what vaccines protect your children from? Pain. Suffering. Irreparable harm. Death.

And you would be the first to line up if you had an inkling of what the death of a child feels like. You would be crawling through the streets on your hands and knees, begging, BEGGING to get that vaccine into your precious babies because that is what I would have done, if I could, to save my daughter.

The fact is, there was no vaccine for her. Not for her illness. And she died. She died at age five and a half, and she is gone.

And I watch these arguments trotted out on Facebook and twitter citing false science and long discredited'studies' that just won't stop and Jenny McCarthy quotes and 'it's MY choice' to not vaccinate...and I think...what would you have done if your child lay dying? Would you give them a scientifically proven, safe and effective vaccine and risk the minuscule likelihood of a side effect? Or would you let them go, knowing that at least they won't develop autism (which they wouldn't even develop anyway because SCIENCE)?

And don't you DARE tell me that you wouldn't vaccinate them then. Don't you dare. You have no idea what it feels like to go through what we went through.

So, look at Griffin. Tell me why he gets to bear the brunt of your stupidity and reckless abuse of our protection? Tell me.

Seven more days until I know that my baby is safe. Seven more days.

How is your week going, anti-vaxxers?
