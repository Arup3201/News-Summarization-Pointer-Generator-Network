Francesco Totti was given an unexpected gift as his Roma side beat AEK Athens on Saturday. Unforunately, he broke it.

The 37-year-old was handed a glass plaque by the Greek side in a pre-season friendly between the two teams.

But as the legendary playmaker accepted the gift, he dropped it onto the floor.

Uh-oh: The Roma star fumbles with the gift ahead of the 2-1 victory

Smash: Totti drops the glass plaque onto the floor

Roma beat AEK Athens 2-1 and the plaque was to celebrate Totti's glittering career in Italy.

It was last year's Serie A runner's up's final friendly before the domestic season started.

They will be hoping Totti's eye is far more on the ball come Saturday evening, when they host Fiorentina at the Stadio Olimpico.
