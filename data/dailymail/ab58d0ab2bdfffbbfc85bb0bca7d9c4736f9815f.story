The mother of a teenage girl knocked down by a car and killed alongside her best friend has described how she cradled her daughter for hours after the crash, looking into her eyes and calling her 'my angel'.

Jasmine Allsop, 14, died alongside 16-year-old Olivia Lewry outside her home in Gosport, Hampshire, in the early hours of Sunday morning.

A 20-year-old man - whose identity has not been confirmed by police - is believed to have been in a relationship with Olivia. He was arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently being questioned by police.

Last night Jasmine's mother Rose revealed the moment she ran out of her house to see her daughter lying in the road, before picking her up and saying her final goodbye.

Friends of the girls say that the 
20-year-old suspected of killing them went to a nearby petrol station to
get help and then passed out, shortly before being arrested by police.

The man, who was initially arrested on
suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving before officers 
launched a murder inquiry, remains in police custody.

Detectives were last night given a further 24 hours to continue quizzing the man on suspicion of the double murder.

A
Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'We have been granted further time by 
the courts to continue questioning a 20-year-old man on suspicion of 
murder after a fatal road traffic collision in Gosport on Sunday, 
November 3, 2013.

'I can't believe she's gone': Rosemary Allsop is comforted by a well-wisher as she looks at the floral tributes left by her daughter's friends

'The suspect can remain in police custody for interviewing now until tomorrow evening.'

One friend, who did not want to be named, said: 'I heard Olivia was going out with the guy who has been arrested.'

The
girls were apparently hit by a green Honda Civic around 20 yards from 
Jasmine's terraced house as they walked home at about 4.15am.

Jasmine – known as Jas – died at the scene, while Olivia was taken to hospital with severe injuries but died later on Sunday.

Jasmine's mother yesterday spoke outside her 
home where she described the heart-rending moment she visited her 
daughter in a hospital mortuary.

I've
only just been to see her body. I can't believe she's gone,' said Ms Allsop, 37

'She would 
have loved to see all these flowers and to see how much she meant to 
everybody.

'It's harder for me that she died right outside my house.

'I
didn't let her go for four hours when it happened.

'I was just kissing 
her and holding her in the road - I couldn't bear to let her go.

'I looked into her big blue eyes and told her she had always been my angel and I had always loved her.'

She added: 'She had hundreds of friends and they've all been here to pay their respects.

'Tonight her friends are all heading to the local park to light lanterns, play music and just remember the girls.

'I don't know if we'll go along - it was all a bit too much last night when they did something similar.

'There must have been 200 people there, even though it was pouring with rain.

'At school today they even held an assembly for Jasmine and Olivia and the school sent flowers to us too, which was lovely.

'The response from everyone has been amazing.

'Now I just feel empty. It's awful, because I keep expecting her to walk back through the front door.'

Tributes: Friends have left bunches of flowers at the scene of the two girls' death, and have gathered to remember the teenagers

'Sleep tight': One friend's heartfelt tribute to Olivia, who has died at the age of just 16

Ms
Allsop said earlier that she had been enjoying a 'girly night' watching 
horror films with the teenagers. Emergency services had woken her in the 
middle of the night.

'It
was just all a blur,' she said. 'I cannot remember what happened. I had
gone to bed. I didn't see anything. I just thought they were playing 
CDs and talking about boys and make-up.

'I
went out and then a neighbour covered me in a blanket. I kissed her - 
it was four hours before they took her body away because I did not want 
to let her go.

'I told her she was my angel and I'd loved her since the day she was born. I can remember her big blue eyes staring.'

She added: 'I'm empty inside and lost. I keep expecting her to come through the door.

'We
had a girls' night in. Jasmine was straightening my hair and plucking 
my eyebrows and Olivia was here. Jasmine was a gorgeous, lovely, bubbly 
character - they were best friends.'

Mourners: Two friends carry flowers to the scene, which is still cordoned off as police continue their investigation

Jasmine's
father Kevin MacLaughlan, 58, also paid tribute to his daughter, 
saying: 'She was beautiful. The most beautiful, bubbly natured girl - 
outgoing and affectionate, very caring and bubbly.'

The 14-year-old was studying at Brune Park Community School, where Olivia used to be a pupil.

Head
teacher Richard Kelly said: 'They were both independent, strong-minded 
individuals who lived their lives to the full with confidence and a 
sense of humour and a sense of fun.

'We
will miss them both immensely and the unique talents which they 
displayed. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families at this 
dreadful time.'

Di 
Lloyd, principal of St Vincent College where the older girl was studying
at the time of her death, said: 'We're sending our sincere condolences 
to Olivia's family.

'We're
very shocked and saddened. At the moment everyone is coming to terms 
with it and preparing to support the students who are coming in today.'

Continuing investigation: Both girls were struck by a green Honda Civic in this suburban street. A man was arrested by police after he collapsed at a nearby petrol station

Call for witnesses: Police officers put up a sign urging people to come forward if they have any information about events leading up to the incident

Friends
have paid tribute to the popular schoolgirls, but Hampshire 
Constabulary was forced to delete hundreds of Facebook posts amidst 
fears they could jeopardise the police investigation.

Officers
wrote: 'Please DO NOT post comments which could have a detrimental 
effect on this investigation or that speculate on the circumstances.

'Remember there are grieving families who have just lost loved ones.'

Detective
Superintendent Dick Pearson, from Hampshire Constabulary, said today: 
'I would like to thank members of the public for their substantial 
co-operation and assistance with our investigation so far.

'A
dedicated team of officers and staff from a range of departments are 
working closely together to analyse leads from witnesses and forensics.

'They were best friends and were always together. It’s so sad. Everyone is shocked and I don’t think anyone can believe what has happened. They were good girls and easy to get along with. They didn’t have any enemies. They were loved by everyone. There will be a lot of tears’

- Jazmine Bates, friend

'The green Honda Civic is the subject of further examinations to ensure all potential evidence has been gathered and preserved.'

Friends
and neighbours gathered yesterday near the scene of the tragedy to 
mourn the pair. Jazmine Bates, 16, said: ‘They were lovely, bubbly girls
and everyone around here knew them.

‘They
were best friends and were always together. It’s so sad. Everyone is 
shocked and I don’t think anyone can believe what has happened.

‘They
were good girls and easy to get along with. They didn’t have any 
enemies. They were loved by everyone. There will be a lot of tears.’

Sasha Ewing, also 16, said: ‘They were happy girls who were always out with mates and having a good time. It’s
such a shock - one minute they were here and now they are not.’

Damien
Bannon, 19, who knew both girls, said: ‘I believe the girls had been to
a party and were standing outside the house talking when the car hit 
them. The driver was a friend of theirs. ‘I still can’t believe it. It’s
such a tragedy.’

Mr Bannon,
a decorator, said Jasmine’s older brother Reece was ‘distraught and 
angry’ at her death. ‘He was very fond and protective of his little 
sister,’ he added.

Schoolfriends who 
asked not to be named described the girls as ‘bubbly, outgoing, and 
extremely popular.’ One said: ‘They loved being the centre of attention 
and were very sociable. They were always listening to popular chart 
music or dubstep.’

Meanwhile devastated neighbours laid flowers at the scene and spoke of their shock.

A
message on one bunch said: ‘In love and memory of Olivia and Jaz. 
Thinking of you. Lots of love Regan, Taylor, Kayleigh and Tom.’

Family 
friend Victoria Berry, 45, who lived opposite Jasmine’s former Gosport 
address, described the teenager as an ‘absolutely gorgeous girl’.

She 
added: ‘What has happened to her and her friend is an absolute tragedy 
and a huge loss to all that knew and loved her.

‘It’s hard to believe that I’ll never see her again.’

The
street was cordoned off by police yesterday as scene of crime officers 
in white overalls examined the scene, marked with yellow and red cones.
