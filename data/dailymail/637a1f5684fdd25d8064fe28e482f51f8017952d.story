Arrested: Stevie McMullen, 31, was caught this afternoon, having been on the run since Tuesday

A man who went on the run after he was freed from a prison van on his way to trial has been arrested, police confirmed tonight.

Stevie McMullen, 31, was being taken to court alongside Ryan MacDonald, 20, when three masked men armed with guns attacked the GEOAmey prison transport vehicle in Salford on Tuesday.

Police caught McMullen this afternoon, travelling in a car with two other men on the A6, near Lancaster University, Greater Manchester Police said.

‘Dangerous’ MacDonald is still at large and there is a £10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.

At the time of the escape, McMullen 
was due to appear on trial for conspiracies to kidnap, rob, commit arson
and possess a firearm.

He has now been arrested on suspicion of escaping from lawful custody.

The other two men, aged 27 and 25, 
were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. They have been 
taken into police custody for questioning.

Assistant Chief Constable Steve 
Heywood said: ‘Since two prisoners were sprung from a GEOAmey prison van
on Tuesday, our officers have been working round-the-clock to trace 
these fugitives and bring them back into custody.

‘This afternoon, we have arrested a 
31-year-old man in the Lancashire area as part of this operation, but 
our efforts will continue to trace 20-year-old Ryan MacDonald, who is 
still wanted by police.'

‘On Friday, a £10,000 reward was put 
forward for information leading to the capture of these two men.

This 
full £10,000 reward still stands for anyone who gives us information 
that leads to MacDonald's arrest and will be paid when he is back behind
bars.

Investigation: The GEOAmey prison van was on Regent Road with its side door open and glass all over the road

Looking: A police officer stands guard at the crime scene where two men escaped from a prison van in Salford

Probe: A forensic officer retrieves evidence at the crime scene where two men escaped from a prison van

‘I would ask members of the public not
to approach this man due to the potential danger he poses, but if you 
see him then please call the police immediately.

‘We continue to follow up on a number 
of leads but I would also like to offer MacDonald the opportunity to 
hand himself in, which he can do either by calling police himself, or by
contacting a trusted family member, friend or his solicitor.’

Still at large: Ryan MacDonald, 20, who has now been sentenced in his absence, is still on the run

Shortly after 9am on Tuesday, a prison
van carrying prisoners from HMP Altcourse to Manchester Crown Square 
was attacked on Regent Road, Salford, by at least three men wearing dark
clothing and balaclavas.

The men had arrived at the location in a dark coloured Saab and threatened staff transporting the prisoners with a shotgun.

Five men - believed to be three 
offenders and the two escaped prisoners - then got back into the Saab, 
which was driven a short distance and abandoned.

It is believed three ran towards a nearby estate and two may have further escaped on a motorbike that was later found abandoned.

On Tuesday, April 30 a 28-year-old 
woman and 24-year-old man were detained at a house on the Ordsall 
estate, Salford on suspicion of being involved in assisting an offender.

They have been released on bail pending further inquiries until June 
26.

MacDonald was due to be sentenced for conspiracy to commit robbery and aggravated vehicle taking when he escaped.

His delayed hearing was held on Friday at Manchester Crown Court as he was jailed for seven years and 10 months.

The 20-year-old defendant had pleaded guilty to the offences at an earlier hearing.

MacDonald was part of a gang who 
targeted pawnbrokers in Manchester and Salford where jewellery was 
stolen in daylight smash-and-grab raids.

Dangerous: Police warn that 20-year-old Ryan McDonald, of Salford, is still at large and should not be approached

Response: Two inmates escaped after a prison van was attacked on a road in Salford, Greater Manchester

Chief Superintendent Kevin Mulligan 
said on Friday: ‘It is unfortunate that MacDonald wasn't present today 
to see this sentence being passed down but we will track him down and 
find him to ensure that he does get his day in the dock.

‘The offences for which he has been 
sentenced today only underline just how dangerous he is. So I would like
to continue my plea to anyone who has information on his whereabouts to
call us.

‘This man has no place on our streets 
and will not be allowed to undermine the work we have done in Salford to
help make people feel safe.

‘Anyone who sees MacDonald is not to approach him but call the police.’

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 0161 856 5237, Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or, in an emergency, call 999.
