David Cameron announced on Tuesday
that every householder connected to the internet will have their access to 
online porn blocked unless they ask to receive it.

And while many people are heralding the 'opt-in' porn restrictions as a success, Dr Brooke Magnanti- research scientist, and writer, who, until her identity was revealed in November 2009, was known by the pen name Belle de Jour - has shed some interesting light on the new development.

Writing on The Telegraph, she said: 'One big assumption seems to be that only blokes will opt-in to porn, because the widespread myth is that only men watch it. But women seek out hardcore content too.'

Belle De Jour writer Dr Brooke Magnanti says Cameron's internet porn 'opt-in' system won't stop women watching sex online

She goes on to explain that women don't just seek hardcore content in erotic fiction such as Fifty Shades Of Grey but also online.

She revealed that Google search terms such as 'porn,' and 'Playboy' are more likely to be entered by men than by women, however, generic words such as 'sex,' are equally as likely to be entered by women and they are actually more likely to type 'adult sex,' 'free sex,' and 'cyber sex' than men are.

She maintains that the searches demonstrate the extent to which the internet has helped remove stigma for women who seek out porn.

'The fact that women are porn consumers too is not something you hear a lot about - you're far more likely to hear shock stats about the number of 12 year-olds looking at porn than adult women, even though the latter category hugely outnumbers the former,' she adds.

Dr Brooke Magnanti - research scientist, and writer, who, until her identity was revealed in November 2009, was known by the pen name Belle de Jour- found that many women watch porn online, too

Dr Magnanti was writing in response to David Cameron's unveiling of a raft of reforms to shield children from 'poisonous' websites that are 'corroding childhood'.

By the end of next year, all 19million 
UK homes currently connected to the net will be contacted by service 
providers and told they must say whether family-friendly filters that 
block all porn sites should be switched on or off.

From the end of this year, all new 
customers setting up a broadband account or switching provider will have
 the filters automatically switched on unless they opt to disable them 
to allow sites with ‘adult content’.

But Dr Magnanti outlines her concern that the new regulations conflate 'the adult and consensual with the obviously deviant and criminal'. 

In light of the news. she concludes: 'And for the silent majority out there of women who have watched porn and probably would do so again, will this herald a surge in signups to private browsing services? Possibly.

'But my guess is that lots of ladies will simply go back to that old faithful, lo-fi option: the paperback rack.'
