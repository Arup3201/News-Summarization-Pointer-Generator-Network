The highlight of Royal couturier David Emanuel’s life was not – as you might think – watching Lady Diana Spencer emerge from her wedding carriage wearing the dress he created in 1981.

It took place in a hospital office in Berkshire on February 4 this year. That is the day a Macmillan nurse showed him the blood-test result that proved he was free from prostate cancer.

Every year, more than 40,000 men are diagnosed with the condition. Last year it killed 11,000.

David, who has also dressed Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Collins, Jane Seymour and Bianca Jagger, has opened up about his experience to encourage other men to be tested.

Although some men experience symptoms – such as frequent night urination, problems starting and stopping urinating, or pain – many, including David, do not.

Indeed, it was only thanks to his friend, theatre impresario Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, that he had his prostate investigated at all.

‘I had read about prostate cancer for years but, like so many men, ignored it. Andrew, with whom I have worked many times, spoke out about his experience with prostate cancer back in 2009. Before that, he had kept it a secret from everyone. I wrote to him immediately.’

The second reason was his imminent 60th birthday. ‘Then my stepmother phoned saying that my father might have a prostate problem. So last November, I made an appointment with my GP.’

He was given a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test, which looks for a protein produced by the cells of the prostate, the male gland surrounding the neck of the bladder, and which releases a fluid component of semen. Elevated PSA levels may indicate a problem with the prostate.

David’s level was 6.9, so his GP referred him to consultant urologist Marc Laniado at Heatherwood Hospital in Ascot, near David’s home. ‘Ideally a PSA reading ought to be under five,’ says Mr Laniado.

If cancer is suspected, a variety of tests are performed. A second blood test showed that David’s PSA had gone up a little further – to 7.3.

Mr Laniado also recommended he have a multiparametric MRI, with which radiologists are now able to differentiate cancerous from benign tissue.

He also used the Gleason Score system, which grades cancer from one to five, with five being the most serious.

The final test was a biopsy – where samples of tissue (or cores) from the rectum were removed under local anaesthetic to ascertain how much cancer is present.

Unfortunately the tests concluded that David had an aggressive form of prostate cancer. ‘There was a lot apparent in the MRI, his Gleason Score was high, and most of the biopsy cores had cancer present,’ says Mr Laniado.

‘I was called into Marc’s office and just froze,’ says David. ‘I know he was talking, but I’m not sure what he said.’

‘This numb reaction is quite common,’
points out Mr Laniado. A Macmillan nurse was in the room at the time 
for support. ‘That’s when I realised it was serious,’ says David.

Controversy exists over whether certain forms of prostate cancer ought to be treated. ‘In many cases the risk of side effects from treatment – such as impotence – outweigh the benefits.

Prostate cancer often grows very slowly. If it is unlikely to kill the patient within their lifetime, then watching and waiting may be the right approach.’

Two-thirds of those with low-risk cancer won’t have aggressive treatment.

But David had very high-risk cancer – where the PSA changes fast. Mr Laniado recommended keyhole surgery to remove the prostate.

‘These days it’s possible to be very focused in removal,’ he says.

David was adamant that he wanted to go ahead as soon as possible. ‘I wasn’t too worried about side effects. I told Marc that I had read what Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote. He described his impotence with great courage.

'I am one of 11, but I didn’t mention it to my nine brothers. I told my sister Margaret just before I went into the Wrexham Park Hospital on December 13, and my children Oliver and Eloise came to look after me.’

The prostate is between 2.5cm and 7cm long. Mr Laniado used a robot to help him perform the surgery.

A 2.5cm incision is made just above the belly button, through which the prostate is removed, and then five small incisions – about 8mm long – above the genitals, through which the instruments are passed.

‘Cutting away the prostate is a delicate operation,’ he says. ‘But we are able to be very specific in separating it from the nerves that allow erection and stop incontinence.’

A rare complication – a minute leak from the bladder into the bloodstream – meant that David had to have a catheter for weeks afterwards.

From the moment he was given the all-clear, he threw himself into his recovery. ‘I felt that I wanted to take charge and decided to be very healthy. I now swim outdoors at home every day – for about 20 minutes.’

He also drinks a rather alarming green concoction. ‘I make up huge juices out of fruit and vegetables –apple, sometimes ginger, cucumber, and some spirulina. I have a couple of these every day.’

The surgery was a huge success. ‘I had to do pelvic-floor exercises – spending a lot of time with a catheter means that you lose muscle tone,’ he explains.

He also had a procedure to correct minor incontinence. But otherwise, he has not suffered any side effects. ‘This is like a second chance. And I’ve told my brothers to get tested immediately.’
