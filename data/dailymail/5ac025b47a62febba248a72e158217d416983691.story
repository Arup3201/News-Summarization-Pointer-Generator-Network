Marouane Fellaini says it is 'nonsense' to suggest that Manchester United are turning into a route-one team by taking advantage of his height and power.

Louis van Gaal has benefitted from using the 6ft 4in Belgium midfielder in a more advanced role as a target man behind the main striker, and it proved effective once again when United won 2-1 at Liverpool on Sunday to go five points clear of their great rivals in the race for a Champions League place.

It has also led to criticism of United's tactics, with even West Ham boss Sam Allardyce labelling Van Gaal's team 'Long Ball United' after Fellaini's physical presence helped snatch a 1-1 draw at Upton Park last month.

Louis van Gaal's tactics have been heavily criticised during his debut Premier League season

But Fellaini said: 'It is nonsense that our game system is based on me. Our system is based on many good players.

'We play a beautiful football. We play forward, scoring, putting on pressure. There are great players around.'

Fellaini came under fire for his performances as a defensive midfielder under David Moyes last season after following his old Everton boss to United in a £27.5million deal, but can also play as a box-to-box midfielder.

The 27-year-old admits it would be easier to pin down one position but is just grateful to be playing after a difficult start to life at Old Trafford.

'Fellaini is at his best when he plays,' he added. 'It does not matter where. This season we have played many different tactics: 3-5-2, 5-3-2, 4-2-2-2, 4-3-3. Of course, it would be easier to play in one position, but you have to always adjust to the coach. I play, that's the main thing.

'I can play in different positions. Number six, number eight or as a second striker. At eight, I can go back and forth and arrive in the box. Second striker I played at Everton. At United it's different because I play in a triangle in midfield. It's simple: I adjust myself to the system of the coach.'

Fellaini admits that strict disciplinarian Van Gaal is exactly the kind of character United needed to knock them into shape after they finished seventh in the Premier League under Moyes last season.

It looked as though Fellaini would be one of the first players out of the exit, but Van Gaal reassured him that he could still have a future at United when he arrived last summer.

'He told me "prove yourself and we'll see". Now they are counting on me. There were never any real doubts. I was injured at the beginning of the season and then returned.

'The coach gave me confidence and I proved myself in a few matches. After that, I was injured and I got sick again. For three weeks I was on antibiotics. It took a while, but now I can finally enjoy.

'The coach is very strict, but that's good. We needed such a coach. Last season we had a bad season. We even missed European qualification. We needed a coach who would put some players' feet back on the ground.

Fellaini also backed Belgium team-mate Adnan Januzaj (far right) to make an impact at Old Trafford

'If he says something, you should do it. Otherwise you'll fly out of it. If he has to take you off the pitch when the game hasn't been going on for more than 30 minutes he'll do it. Or during half-time. Fortunately, it hasn't happened to me yet.'

Fellaini had some words of encouragement for his Belgian compatriot Adnan Januzaj who has struggled to make an impact under Van Gaal. The 20-year-old's lack of opportunities has also cost him a place in the Belgium squad for the forthcoming games against Cyprus and Israel.

'He has accepted his current situation,' said Fellaini. 'I try to help him. He knows he must play if he wants to come back for Belgium. It is part of growing up. He will now work harder to try to come back to the national team.'
