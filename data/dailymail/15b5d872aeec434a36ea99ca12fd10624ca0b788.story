Australians are being urged to take extra care with their personal online details as the largest known collection of internet user names and passwords have been hacked by a Russian crime ring.

The records includes an astounding 1.2 billion user name and password combinations and more than 500 million email addresses gathered from 420,000 websites including household names and small internet sites.

Milwaukee firm, Hold Security, discovered the massive scam and the company’s founder Alex Holden said the hackers did not just target American companies with the fraud stretching out across the globe.

‘They targeted any website they could get, ranging from Fortune 500 companies to very small websites,’Mr Holden told The New York Times. ‘And most of these sites are still vulnerable.

Lyonswood Investigations & Forensic Group managing director Lachlan Jarvis warned there was a very low level of control of your information when it was placed online.

‘It’s virtually impossible for you to be entirely secure with your personal data - I don’t think anyone really has the time, the know-how and the resources to ensure such a level of security,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.

‘But you can maximise your security in terms of your computer usage, especially for people without much computer knowledge.’

Mr Jarvis said there are endless ways which personal data can be snapped up using hacking techniques to get passwords for accounts including social media or emails.

‘It’s quite incredible to see the ingenuity of the scams that people come up with,’ he said.

‘If anyone who thinks they are too smart to be scammed they are probably fooling themselves.’

But he did say that educating yourself about possible online scams, using your common sense when it came to providing your personal details and understanding how you can be left vulnerable when online would help.

‘You should be aware of not clicking on spam emails or attachments but protecting your email address was hard,’ he conceded.

‘But most hacking of these types of things are random unlike social engineering which is usually targeted.’
