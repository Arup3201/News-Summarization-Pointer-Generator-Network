The man suspected of abducting University of Virginia student Hannah Graham will be considered for a psychiatric evaluation.

Jesse Matthew, 32, appeared in Fairfax County Circuit Court today via video link for an unrelated rape case dating back to 2005.

Addressing the prosecutor, his attorney James Camblos said he had reason to question Matthew's sanity.

Psychiatric evaluation? Jesse Matthew will be considered for a sanity test as he faces sexual assault charges in a 2005 case. He is charged with intent to defile 18-year-old University of Virginia student Hannah Graham

The judge took no immediate action on Camblos' request for a psychiatric evaluation at the arraignment on Friday morning but will address it at a later date.

Matthew is charged in Fairfax with abduction with intent to defile, attempted capital murder and sexual penetration in connection with a September 2005 assault on a 26-year-old woman in Fairfax City. 

He is charged in Charlottesville with the abduction of Graham with the intent to defile, but is not yet facing murder charges.

Authorities say they also have forensic evidence linking him to the 2009 disappearance and death of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington. 

Most of Friday's hearing, in which Matthew appeared via video hookup from the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, concerned who would represent Matthew. 

The judge appointed both the Fairfax County public defender and Camblos to represent Matthew as co-counsel, over the objections of Camblos and Fairfax County Commonwealth's Attorney Ray Morrogh.

Matthew requested that Camblos, who is representing Matthew in the Graham case, be appointed to handle the Fairfax case as well.

'I would prefer Mr Camblos to be my attorney, if possible. I've built a relationship with him,' Matthew said, with Camblos at his side at the Charlottesville-area jail.

Camblos objected to the idea of serving as co-counsel with the Fairfax public defenders, saying it would amount to 'two chiefs, not enough Indians.' 

Morrogh objected on the basis that it would be a waste of taxpayers' money to have both appointed. 

But the judge, Dennis Smith, said the two ought to be able to work together, and bringing both onto the case should ensure that the trial is not delayed. 

He said the law requires the public defender be appointed except in unusual circumstances.

There was clearly some tension between Camblos and the public defender's office — after both were appointed, Camblos told the judge Chief Public Defender Todd Petit had offered to allow Camblos to serve as lead counsel in the event both were appointed. 

Petit told the judge he had indeed made such an offer, but Camblos had rejected it and Petit now wanted his deputy, Dawn Butorac, to serve as lead counsel. The judge said he would leave the two of them to decide who would be lead.

Search: The search for the 18-year-old went state-wide with multiple law enforcement agencies

Butorac declined comment after Friday's hearing.

Another hearing was set for November 14 to set a trial date.

After Friday's hearing, Morrogh said he will continue to consult with prosecutors in the Charlottesville area to determine which case should go to trial first, and that he is prepared to go first or last. He said that, ideally, he'd like the trial to be able to go forward within six months.

He said the victim in the 2005 assault is no longer in the country, but is cooperating with investigators and will be available to testify at trial.

Graham, an 18-year-old sophomore, went missing in Charlottesville September 13. 

After a month-long search, her remains were found in mid-October.
