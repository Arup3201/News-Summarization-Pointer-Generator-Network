Two bungling teenagers stole a a £100,000 Lamborghini during a break-in only to crash it two miles later.

Connor Smart, 18, and friend Jason Grant, 17, had broken into the the Aberdeen home in the middle of the night where they stole three sets of car keys.

The pair made off with the Lamborghini Gallardo and a BMW X5, worth £60,000, as well as four mobile phones, an iPad, a TV and £500 cash.

But the car thieves lost control of the high powered Lamborghini and crashed into a van just two miles away.

Officers were then led directly to Smart's family home after the car owner used an app to track down one of the stolen iphones.

The pair denied the offences but a jury of eight men and seven women took just 40 minutes to find them guilty at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.

Car owner Colin Crighton and his partner woke up in the early hours of the morning to find his cars had gone along with the keys for his Aston Martin Vanquish.

Grant and Smart also took at BMW X5, worth £60,000, as well as four mobile phones, an iPad, a TV, wallet, handbag and £500 from the property in the west end of Aberdeen

Police were called out to reports of a car crash on the city's Lewis Road at about 3:09am.

When officers arrived at the collision scene, they found the damaged Lamborghini and a van lying on its side on a pavement. The driver had left the scene.

Neighbour Kimberley Murdoch told the court she had seen Grant driving the Lamborghini in the early hours of August 4 after hearing loud revving coming from outside her bedroom window. 

Kimberley Murdoch, 26, said there were lots of high performance cars in her neighbourhood and thought it was a strange time of the morning for her neighbour to be out.

'I heard the revving of what sounded like a super car,' said the medical student. 'It was approximately three o'clock in the morning.'

The 26-year-old said she initially thought it might be her neighbour's Bentley or Aston Martin but when she looked out of her bedroom window, she noticed both cars were still parked outside.

 The pair had tried to deny the offences but the jury of eight men and seven women took just 40 minutes to find them guilty at Aberdeen Sheriff Court (pictured)

Ms Murdoch then saw a white Lamborghini drive past her window a few minutes later.

She said: 'I saw that there was one occupant in the car. It was a male.

'It appeared that the driver wasn't familiar with driving that type of vehicle.

'The revving was extremely loud for the speed that the car was trying to go at.'

Sheriff Graeme Buchanan remanded both teenagers, who live in Aberdeen, in custody and deferred sentence until next month for background reports.

He also instructed the fiscal to carry out investigations after one of the jurors complained about an alleged obscenity being shouted by one of the teenagers as they were led away from the dock.
