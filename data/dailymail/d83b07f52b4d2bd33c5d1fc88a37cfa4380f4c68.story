The remarkable ability of pigeons to navigate with pinpoint accuracy has baffled scientists for centuries.

But now researchers think they may have part of the answer - the birds follow hedges.

Scientists from Oxford University found that homing pigeons' ability to remember routes depends on the complexity of the landscape below.

Complex: As well as using hedges, pigeons are believed to be able to orient homeward from distant unfamiliar places using a mysterious system thought to involve smells and an inbuilt solar compass

While open fields are devoid of landmarks, and cities are too crowded, hedges provide ideal landmarks for navigation, they found.

The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Biology Letters, released 31 pigeons from four sites around Oxford for an average of 20 flights each.

Dr Richard Mann, who has since moved from Oxford to Uppsala University in Sweden, said: 'Looking at how quickly they memorise different routes, we see that that visual landmarks play a key role.

'Pigeons have a harder time remembering routes when the landscape is too bland like a field or too busy like a forest or dense urban area.

'The sweet spot is somewhere in between - relatively open areas with hedges, trees or buildings dotted about.

'Boundaries between rural and urban areas are also good.' Scientists are fascinated about how pigeons learn to find their way because the birds have such small brains.

Urban: Despite being home to the majority of the UK's pigeons, cities such as London (pictured) are actually too bustling and full of landmarks for the birds to be able to navigate to the best of their ability

Whatever method they use makes highly efficient use of their limited mental processing power.

Memorising the route, however, is only part of the process.

Pigeons are also able to orient homeward from distant unfamiliar places, using a mysterious system thought to involve smells and an inbuilt solar compass.

Cracking the mystery could allow the same processes to be installed in machines and robots.

Tim Guilford, professor of animal behaviour at Oxford University, said: 'There may be certain rules that free-flying birds use to structure information that enable them to map the environment using their limited brain power.

'Fundamentally understanding how they do this will tell us more about their abilities and limitations, and could reveal methods that robots with limited processing power might use to navigate.'

He added: 'We mainly use pigeons for studies like this because we can be confident that they will bring back the GPS devices with the data. With wild birds, there is a real risk that we won't get the equipment and data back, but fundamentally we expect them to use similar navigational methods.'
