Outspoken: Stephen Fry has never been shy about his opinions or his sexuality and wrote and open letter to number 10 claiming Putin was making scapegoats of gay people

David Cameron had a secret pub summit with Stephen Fry after  the actor called for a boycott of the Winter Olympics in Russia over its treatment of gay people.

The two men met in a pub in London’s East End which is co-owned by Mr Fry’s fellow actor and gay rights campaigner Sir Ian McKellen.

Mr Fry, a self-proclaimed bitter opponent of the Tories, challenged Mr Cameron after the Prime Minister said it was vital that Britain attend the Games in Sochi to make the  case for more gay rights in Russia.

Well-placed sources said that at the end of the meeting – which took place in a private room at the back of The Grapes pub in trendy Limehouse – Mr Fry said he had a better understanding of Mr Cameron’s argument and thanked him for his assurances.

‘They had a very pleasant discussion,’ said one source. ‘Mr Cameron explained in detail why he thought we should attend the Games.

‘Mr Fry asked him how Britain would use its attendance to make the case for gay rights and seemed pleased at the replies he received.’

The extraordinary ‘gay rights pub summit’ between the actor and the Prime Minister on Monday evening came days after Mr Fry had written an open letter to No 10. He claimed that Russia’s

President Putin was making scapegoats of gay people, just as Hitler did with the Jews.  Mr Fry had made no attempt to conceal his lifelong disdain for  the Tories, although he praised the Prime Minister’s stance on gay rights in the UK.

He had ‘instinctively disliked’ the Conservatives for most of his life, said Mr Fry.

But he said that he had the ‘utmost respect’ for Mr Cameron’s support for gay marriage. ‘For that  I will always admire you, whatever other differences may lie between us,’ he wrote.

‘In the end I believe you know when a thing is wrong or right. Please act on that instinct now.’

He continued: ‘At all costs Putin cannot be seen to have the approval of the civilised world. The Summer Olympics of 2012 were one of the most glorious moments of my life and the life of my country.

'For  there to be a Russian Winter Olympics would stain the movement  for ever and wipe away any of  that glory.’

But he was rebuffed in a series  of tweets by the Prime Minister: ‘Thank you for your note @stephenfry. I share your deep concern about the abuse of gay people in Russia.

‘However, I believe we can better challenge prejudice as we attend, rather than boycotting the Winter Olympics. DC.’

Newspaper publisher Evgeny Lebedev, co-owner of The Grapes, invited Mr Fry to join him and Mr Cameron at the pub on Monday to thrash out their differences over a drink in a private room.

Asked why Mr Cameron had agreed to meet  the actor, a No 10 source said: ‘The PM meets all sorts of people all the time. There is nothing unusual in him meeting Stephen Fry.

‘He was having dinner at the pub with Mr Lebedev who suggested  Mr Fry join them for drinks. The PM was happy to agree. It wasn’t a negotiation, it was a friendly discussion.’

Mr Fry also called on members of the public to back an anti-Russian gay rights protest in London planned for yesterday.

‘Lots of people popping down to Whitehall to make their feelings known. What to wear, what to  wear?’ he wrote on a social networking site.
