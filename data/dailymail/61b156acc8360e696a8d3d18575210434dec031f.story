A video of a naked man riding his motorbike through the streets of Germany - in broad daylight - has become the latest internet sensation.

The footage starts innocently enough with a close-up of a sleek black R6 bike. So far, so good.

But then the camera pans across to the rider as a 'Baller Boyz' sticker is put on his bare chest.

Baller Boyz then proceeds to take off his boxer shorts, leaving him stark naked - apart from his boots, gloves and helmet.

At least he's got a helmet: Naked biker Baller Boyz is seen here roaring through Munster city centre in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany

Baller Boyz apparently carried out the stunt as a result of a Facebook bet, in which he claimed he'd do it if a picture he posted on the networking site got 1,000 'Likes'

As if he didn't get enough attention already, Baller Boyz even stopped to rev the engine - very loudly - and created smoke by 'burning rubber'

He may have no shame but he's clearly a stickler for 'elf and safety.

And finally he's off - streaking through Munster, north Rhine-Westphalia, on his trusty steed as shocked Christmas shoppers look on.

Birgit Weusthoff-Schulze was one of many people in the upmarket city centre who could not fail to notice the unusual spectacle.

'It was not unappetising to watch,' she told the newspaper, WestfÃ¤lische Nachrichten.

And she is not alone.

Since it was uploaded on December 15, the footage has had nearly 200,000 hits.

The mystery rider's cheeky journey seemed to be the result of a Facebook bet.

He had put a photo on the social networking site, saying he would ride naked through Munster's Christmas market if the picture got 1,000 'Likes'.

However, not everyone was impressed by his antics, and the police are now investigating the incident.

'We think it was a petty offence,' police spokesman Andreas Bode told thelocal.de.

Bode added that although Baller Boyz's real identity could be difficult to establish, as he kept the helmet visor down throughout, the police 'would be looking into it regardless'.

How it all began... Completed relaxed, he patiently waits to make his grand entrance
