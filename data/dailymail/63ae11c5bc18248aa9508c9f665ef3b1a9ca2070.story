The model girlfriend of a British ex-public schoolboy killed after trying to escape armed thugs in Kenya has spoken of the terrifying moments before he plunged to his death from a third-floor balcony.

Diana Nekoye Sifuna, 24, told how she was forced to wrestle gunmen who called at her home and demanded to see her photographer lover Charlie Grieves-Cook.

Fleeing via a back room, Mr Grieves-Cook, 36, desperately clung on to the balcony’s metal rail, dangling perilously 40ft above ground for 10 minutes, while the intruders fired shots into the apartment.

In the first full account of the bungled raid, Miss Sifuna described in dramatic detail how she screamed at her lover to run as she fought for her life.

Lovers: Diana Sifuna and Charlie Grieves-Cook. Mr Grieves-Cook fell to his death from a balcony after two intruders forced their way into her apartment

The striking model, who is renowned in her home country as a former Face of Africa beauty contestant, told how the couple were watching a film on the evening of March 3 when the doorbell rang at her apartment close to the Kibera township, one of Kenya’s largest slums.

Thinking it was a rubbish collector, she fetched the equivalent of £3 to give as a tip before opening the door to find two youths wearing tracksuits, one of whom demanded to see ‘the mazungu, the white man’.

She said: ‘I asked him to give the name of the white man, but he was unable to say. When I told him he was at the wrong house, I saw him removing a small gun from his waist and he pointed it towards me.

‘I thought it was a toy pistol, so I 
grabbed it. I struggled with him while I was still holding the gun, but 
it went off. I was holding it and at the same time screaming, telling 
Charlie to run away.

‘The
 neighbours started locking their houses. I pushed him outside, where I 
kept on struggling with him, trying to wrestle the gun from him, and it 
fired again.

Terrifying ordeal: Model Diana Sifuna's police statement

‘When the
 gun fired, I released my hand from the gun and went to the next door at
 a corner. I tried banging my neighbour’s door but nobody opened the 
door for me.

‘The boy 
started running while still firing at me. I heard another gunshot 
downstairs, which I later learned hit the watchman of our apartment on 
his hand.

‘When they 
had gone, I entered my house and heard Charlie calling me. I found him 
hanging, having gripped the sides of the balcony.’

In a police statement, which has been shown to The Mail on Sunday, Miss Sifuna told how Mr Grieves-Cook tragically lost his grip and fell on to a concrete ledge before she could fetch a rope to pull him to safety. She said: ‘When I held his hand and tried to pull him up, he advised me to go to the house to get a rope. I went but when I got back I saw him falling down.’

Police yesterday confirmed they had retrieved used gun cartridges, and were carrying out forensic tests on them and on the doorbell.

There was no doctor on duty at the local medical centre, so Miss Sifuna had to take Mr Grieves-Cook to another hospital. They were then refused treatment until one of his friends paid over the phone by credit card so that he could be taken to the intensive-care unit. He later died of his injuries. The detailed account comes after detectives in Nairobi said they believe Mr Grieves-Cook may have been targeted by a jealous love rival. Officers are now planning to question Miss Sifuna about any male friends who may have hired hitmen to kill her lover.

They are trying to piece together the events that brought Mr Grieves-Cook, who comes from one of Kenya’s most prominent white families, to the notoriously crime-ridden area of the capital city where he met his death. Nothing was stolen from Miss Sifuna’s home, leading police to question why the thugs targeted the apartment.

Police commander David Rono Bonei said yesterday: ‘We believe this lady may have had two or three other boyfriends. Men get very jealous. It is only human.

‘Miss Sifuna has a lot more questions to answer. She has been very traumatised and upset, but now it is time to tell us a lot more about her love life.’

Mr Grieves-Cook was born and raised in Kenya before being educated at the £30,000-a-year Hurstpierpoint College, a prominent boarding school in West Sussex. After leaving school, he trained as a chef and worked at some of London’s Michelin-starred restaurants.

He returned to Kenya in 1998 and built a
 successful career in photography. Mr Grieves-Cook met Miss Sifuna a 
year ago during a photo shoot. Despite owning his own home in the 
affluent suburb of Lavington, he was a regular visitor to her apartment 
in a rundown area of Langata.

Around one million people live in 
dilapidated shacks made of plastic sheeting and corrugated iron in 
nearby Kibera, many of them sleeping on dirt floors. One 
hole-in-the-ground latrine services 50 shacks and the open sewers lead 
to epidemics of cholera and enteritis.

Unemployment stands at 50 per cent, there is widespread dependence on the often-lethal home-brewed chang’aa liquor, and social deprivation is rife. Rape and murder rates are high.

Police reluctance to enter Kibera has led to protection rackets that rule the slums.

Senior detective James Manuni said: ‘Diana Nekoye Sifuna is one of the biggest names in the fashion media and she could afford to live somewhere safer. Charlie Grieves-Cook was playing with fire by going to that part of Langata at night, so close to Kibera.’

He said police inquiries showed that other male friends were regular visitors to the Desert Rose apartments and that Mr Grieves-Cook may have become a target.

Four hundred mourners attended a memorial service at Nairobi’s Muthaiga Country Club on Friday, following a funeral service and cremation for family members only.

Charlie’s father Jake, former chairman of Kenya’s Tourist Board and managing director of Gamewatchers Safaris, said he believed the thugs may have followed his son to Miss Sifuna’s apartment, but he would await the findings of the inquiry.

He said: ‘In the meantime, we do not wish to speculate on their motives other than the probability that it was a bungled robbery attempt which had tragic circumstances.

‘We are all devastated at the loss of my son and it is heart-breaking for his family and friends. Charlie was an extraordinary young man with enormous talent who was loved by all who knew him.’
