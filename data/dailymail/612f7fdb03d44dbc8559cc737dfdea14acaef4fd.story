Thief: Amy Luck, 23, lied about being mugged after stealing £10,000 from her own grandfather

A young mother pretended she was mugged to steal £10,000 from her grandfather. 

Amy Luck, 23, from Cadishead, Greater Manchester, couldn't 'resist the temptation' to take the money after being asked to cash in £10,000 Premium Bonds for her grandfather Barry Smith.

She secretly handed the money over to her boyfriend Jonathan Stevens, 21, who buried it in his step-father's garden.

The pair planned to spend it on themselves, Manchester Crown Court heard.

Pregnant mother-of-one Luck and Stevens stood sobbing in the dock together at a sentencing hearing where their behaviour was slammed.

But the thieving pair avoided jail by what the judge described as the 'skin of their teeth'.

Mr Smith kept £10,000 in premium bonds in his granddaughter's name, the court heard.

In May this year, he decided he wanted the money - and so asked Luck to cash them in.

The night before she was due to go to the bank, Luck hatched a plan to keep the money to herself and pretend that she had been mugged.

Stephens originally laughed off the idea before agreeing to take part.

At 10.30am on the morning of May 15 police received a report of a robbery at Union Road, Eccles, from Mr Smith, who had been told by his granddaughter that she had been pounced on returning from Halifax bank.

Luck went on to make a seven-page statement which made police suspicious with its vagueness. 

Verdict: Amy Luck and Jonathan Stephens leave Manchester Crown Court. The thieving pair avoided jail by what the judge described as the 'skin of their teeth'

Luck also claimed to have been robbed of an iPhone 5, but was reluctant for officers to use the 'Find My iPhone' app to trace it.

'It's so hard having that much money put in my bank account when I don't have a pot to p*** in'

After wasting three hours of police time, Luck finally admitted she had taken the money. In a handwritten statement she said: 'It's so hard having that much money put in my bank account when I don't have a pot to **** in. I can get the money back, I'm sorry I wasn't robbed, it was all lies.'

After collecting it from the bank, Luck had thrown it in her boyfriend's car, before he hid it under a flower-bed at an address in Sale.

Richard Littler, defending, said of Luck: 'She'd never seen that amount of money before. She comes from a respectable family and is ordinarily hard-working. Her and her partner are trying to build a car sales business and get away from the benefit system.'

Sentencing, Mr Recorder Driver described the crime as a 'severe breach of trust'.

He ordered Luck, who admitted theft and perverting the course of justice, to serve a year-long sentence, suspended for two years, with a three-month curfew.

Stevens, who admitted theft, was given an eight-month sentence suspended for two years, and 70 hours unpaid work.

The court heard that Luck's grandfather did not support the prosecution.

The judge told them: 'Consider yourselves very lucky - you have stayed out of jail by the skin of your teeth.'
