The parents of a woman who died during childbirth having lost her unborn child have agreed a five-figure settlement with the hospital they blame for her death.

Carly Harper, from West Kirby, Merseyside, died in May 2012 days after she was admitted to Arrowe Park Hospital.

She was just 24 weeks pregnant when her waters broke.

The hairdresser was expecting her first child with boyfriend Alex Dearden, when she developed severe sepsis - a life-threatening blood infection.

Her family have today agreed a settlement ahead of the inquest into the 26-year-old's death, which opened today at Wirral Coroner's Court.  

She told staff at Arrowe Park Hospital, Wirral, she was in pain on the morning of May 19, apparently indicating her contractions had started early.

Carly Harper, from West Kirby, Merseyside, died in May 2012 days after she was admitted to Arrowe Park Hospital. She was just 24 weeks pregnant when her waters broke and she gave birth to a stillborn son

Miss Harper went into hospital on May 19, 2012. An ultrasound scan showed her baby boy was dying and doctors decided to induce the birth

At 3.15pm on May 19, when an utlrasound scan showed Miss Harper’s baby boy was dying, doctors chose to induce the birth.

But her family claim staff delayed inducing the labour and did not act quickly enough over signs that Miss Harper had a severe infection.

It was not until 9.28pm that evening – more than six hours after the scan – that she gave birth to the stillborn boy.

She was taken straight to intensive care and placed on a ventilator, but died of multiple organ failure at 9.10am the next day, with her family at her bedside.   

Her family claim the hospital, run by Wirral University Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, were negligent in caring for Miss Harper.

Their lawyer James Thompson, of Simpson Millar solicitors, said: 'The family remains adamant that the admitted negligent obstetric treatment provided to Carly during the premature labour of her first child was to blame for her death.

'The family feels very strongly that it was a failure from staff at Arrowe Park Hospital to recognise, manage and treat the severe sepsis which led to Carly's death after she went into premature labour.

'The trust produced a Serious Incident Review Report, which recognised a number of failings in the care provided to Carly - including the failure of the obstetric team to respond with sufficient urgency to the seriousness of her condition.  

'The window of time when Carly's life might have been saved was wasted and her family are now living with the consequences.

'The very least they deserve is absolute clarity about what happened on that fatal day, and to be reassured that steps are taken to prevent the senseless loss of such young lives again in the future.

The trust admitted that 'there was a delay in delivering the deceased's foetus and in administering the second antibiotic as per Trust policy'. However, they did not accept their failings contributed to Miss Harper's death

The 26-year-old's family have today agreed a settlement ahead of the inquest into the 26-year-old's death, which opened today at Wirral Coroner's Court

'It is Mr and Mrs Harper's firm belief that Carly died as a consequence of negligent medical treatment. And there was little involvement from the consultant until it was too late.'

Robert Harper, who lives with Carly's mother Christine, said: 'When Carly began feeling unwell we became extremely worried.

'The evening of May 19, Christine stayed with her in hospital and I went home - my wife called me later on to say that it wasn't looking good but told me to stay at home.

'But at 1.30am that night, she called again and said you better get here fast.

'When I saw Carly in the ICU my first words were "my god, what have they done to her". I just couldn't understand what had happened.

'I phoned Carly's sister Kimberley and she brought her brother Tommy down to the hospital straight away. Matthew was away training with the army and he didn't make it in time.'

In reaching a settlement with Mr and Mrs Harper, the trust admitted that "there was a delay in delivering the deceased's foetus and in administering the second antibiotic as per Trust policy".

However, they did not accept that their failings contributed to Carly's death.

The inquest into her death is due to be held over three days before coroner David Lewis who will hear evidence from clinicians that were responsible for Miss Harper's care.
