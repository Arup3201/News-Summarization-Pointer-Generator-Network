Just three years ago, Zahia Dehar was thrown into the spotlight as the underage escort at the centre of a scandal involving France's star footballers.

Now the Algerian beauty has become a fashion muse to top designers including Karl Lagerfield, regularly treading the catwalk in high-profile shows and making front covers of glossy magazines.

Miss Dehar, now 20, has used the scandal to catapult herself to fame, while Bayern Munich player Franck Ribery is facing jail and a hefty fine for spending £5,000 flying her from Paris to a five-star German hotel for sex as a 'birthday present' to himself.

Two other players were also said to have paid £1,500-a-night to sleep with the young call girl, although they all claimed to have believed she was 18 - the legal age for prositution in France.

Just months after having sex with the married father of two,  who is worth £40million, Miss Dehar got an agent and began being photographed for Italian publications V magazine and Vanity Fair Italy as well as popular French magazines.

Smitten Chanel designer Lagerfeld described her as the idealised vision of a French courtesan and even photographed her debut look book himself.

'She is fascinating,' he said. 'She reminds me of the mistresses of the rich and powerful in 18th-Century France.

'And she has the most amazing body. It is an incredible shape.

'I will never tire of photographing her.'

Trading on her notoriety as a sex 
symbol, Miss Dehar reinvented herself as a lingerie designer, showing 
her first collection on the Paris catwalks in January of this year.

The blonde former escort showcased her 
second collection of lingerie at Paris Couture Week in July, and models 
much of the skimpiest underwear herself. She has her own website and 
French sculptor David LaChapelle is exhibiting a metal mould of her 
body.

Although the charges against Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema, 22, and Lyon's Sidney Govou, 30, have never been proven, the three men may never live down the disgrace of their alleged indiscretion.

For Miss Dehar, on the other hand, the shocking story has lifted her from underage call girl working at a French brothel to international stardom.

She moved to France from Algeria when she was 10 and grew up on a crime-ridden housing estate in the Paris suburbs with her mother and two brothers.

Her father walked out on the family when she was 14 and she began bunking off school, meeting wealthy men in expensive bars along the Champs-Elysees.

She told Paris Match at the time of the scandal that she turned to prostitution shortly after her 16th birthday.

'The first time I did it was also to celebrate a man's birthday,' she said.

'I've always looked older than I am, and when I began to understand that I was pleasing to men, I thought: "Why not take advantage of it?"

'I asked for 2,000 ­euros a night or just 500 euros for what I called a brief moment of pleasure.

'I have had encounters with all kinds of people from the world's of sport and showbiz. They proposition me and I make myself available.

'But I have no pimp and I don't give the money I make to anyone.

'I only have paid sexual relations with people that I choose to. No one forces me to do anything and when I don't want to do something, I don't.

'I consider myself to be a call-girl, but not a prostitute.'

In 2010, she was one of 18 girls questioned in a police raid on Paris brothel Cafe Zaman, used by some of France's best footballers, in a scandal that threatened to engulf the country's World Cup campaign.

She said Ribery had hired her for a single night on his 26th birthday, but did not know she was underage, and she refused to give evidence at his trial.

'Franck approached me in a Paris club,' she said. 'He made reservations at a luxury hotel in Munich. We had sex and he paid me. I was a lovely little present, wasn't I?'

Veteran French actress Isabell Adjani is now planning to make a documentary about her rags-to-riches life story.

But critics have described her as 'just a prostitute' with others painting her as a cynical moneymaker for whom self-promotion is the only objective.

Whatever her motivations, life has truly changed for Zahia Dehar.
