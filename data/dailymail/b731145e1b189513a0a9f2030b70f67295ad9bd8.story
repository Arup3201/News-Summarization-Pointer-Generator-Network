Legal brief: John McCririck, 72,  is to sue Channel 4 for £3million over claims he was sacked because of his age

John McCririck has launched legal proceedings against Channel 4 seeking damages totalling £3million after his axing from the station’s new racing output.

McCririck, who was arguably the best known face on C4 racing with appeal reaching far beyond the normal boundaries of the sport, was one of several familiar faces not retained when C4 changed the company producing their racing output from Highflyer to IMG Sports Media.

Others who lost out included John Francome, Alastair Down, Derek Thompson and Mike Cattermole.

But the 72-year-old, who became famous for reporting from the betting ring in his own unique style, has taken his removal hard, alleging the decision announced in October was ageist and that he has suffered public humiliation.

In a statement, McCririck, whose appearances outside the racing world have included Celebrity Big Brother and Wife Swap, said: ‘Channel 4 and production company IMG Sports Media were yesterday each served a letter before action for age discrimination.

‘After 29 years with Channel 4 Racing, on a rolling annual contract, I have been sacked without any consultation or cogent explanation. I am 72.

'I am no longer a member of the group.'

'In
the last couple of days before the deadline was extended I would have 
said it was in the death throes and time for the last rites. Now it is 
on life support with a bit of blinking going on.'

‘For loss of future earnings, unfair career damaging, public humiliation, stress and mental anguish, I will be seeking £500,000.

‘Ageism is illegal. For tens of 
thousands of employees it has become the feared scourge of our society. 
This litigation should prove to be a watershed.

‘There's no upper limit to the amount of damages employment tribunals can award under the Equality Act 2010.

‘I am seeking a further exemplary, 
punitive £2.5m, part of which will be donated to charitable 
organisations helping to prevent negative prejudice in the workplace.’

McCririck said he was being represented on a no-win no-fee basis by 
employment and sports law specialist solicitor Stephen Beverley, of the 
London West End Cavendish Legal Group.

He said his solicitor had 
served papers on the executives he says are responsible for his sacking 
 He alleged they are Channel 4's chief executive David Abraham, 
the broadcaster's creative officer Jay Hunt, sports editor Jamie 
Aitchison and Carl Hicks, executive producer of IMG Sports Media.

He added: ‘Mr Beverley is insisting 
on full disclosure of all documents, phone records and emails up to the 
present day that led to, and followed, my dismissal.

My legal team will also be calling 
past and present Channel 4 Racing presenters and production staff, media
executives, journalists and others to be cross-examined in public by my
QC, who is also acting no-win no-fee.’

McCririck runs the risk of further 
humiliation by launching the action. He will have supporters but others 
will question his judgment.

He acknowledged: ‘It won't be 
pleasant, the vitriol will hurt, Some is bound to stick and further 
threaten my future prospects. But that is the inevitable price when 
asserting what is right against entrenched powerful interests.

‘Along with my legal team, I believe 
this landmark action will be a beacon to motivate numerous workers still
productive as ever, but now living in dread of being unjustly axed.

‘McCririck said he would drop the legal action if he is "fully" reinstated, receives an apology and all his costs are met.'

A Channel 4 spokeswoman said: 'We are grateful to John McCririck for his contribution towards the success of Channel 4 Racing over many years.

‘However, we reject the suggestion that discrimination on the basis of age played any part in the decision not to renew his freelance contract and we will be vigorously defending this claim.'
