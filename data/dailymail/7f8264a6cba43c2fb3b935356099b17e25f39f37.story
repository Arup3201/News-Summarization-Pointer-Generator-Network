Doctors have successfully removed a baby's extra limbs after it was born with four hands and four feet.

The child is now in a stable condition at a hospital in China's southern Guangdong province four days after the surgery.

The 13-day-old boy, from Huizhou, was born joined to a headless parasitic twin joined at the torso on April 2. That has now been removed.

Yu Jiakang, chief surgeon at Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center said: 'They were supposed to be twins, but one had underdeveloped and became deformed.'

The conjoined twins weighed just over 3kg before surgery, with the removed parasitic foetus weighing 0.6kg.

According to the Global Times, the 
baby was diagnosed with pneumonia and congenital heart 
disease, which is common among children in China, before surgery.

His father, named only as Mr Chen, said he had 
taken his son to many hospitals near his home but none have been able to give him 
reasons for the deformity.

Identical twins form when a single egg splits during fertilisation - as opposed to two eggs both being fertilised.

Conjoined
 twins form when a split egg fails to fully separate. A ‘parasite’ 
conjoined twin can survive but not when one absorbs the other.

In 2012 surgeons in Peru operated on a three year old boy to remove a 9in-long parasitic twin weighing a pound and a half.

In 2008 doctors had to remove a 2in embryo from the body of a nine-year-old girl in Greece.

The
 brain, lungs and heart are some of the last parts of the body to 
develop. Removing a parasitic twin is usually easier than attempting to 
separate conjoined twins.

Mr Chen said he blamed himself for not taking good care of his wife and son during pregnancy.

'I only cared about my work. I just thought of making money instead of taking her to hospital for a medical checkup.'

In August last year it was revealed an eight-month-old baby who grew a second 'head' had undergone surgery to have it removed.

Doctors in India said the second head was a 'parasitic twin', weighed almost a kilo and had brain tissue within it.

The child, known as Tofajjal, was suffering from a rare disease called encephalomeningocele, said to affect one in 40,000 to 45,000 
babies.

A similar case happened with a baby in Pakistan two years ago.

A doctor at the National Institute of Child Health in Karachi said that the abnormal birth was the result of a genetic disease which affects only one in a million or so babies.
