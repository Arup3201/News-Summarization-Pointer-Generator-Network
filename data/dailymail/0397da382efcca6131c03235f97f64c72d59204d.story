Sam Champion has officially switched over to the competition as he made his first appearance on longtime morning show rival, the Today Show.

The former Good Morning America weatherman left the ABC morning show to become the managing editor of The Weather Channel where he will anchor his own three-hour show.

Since The Weather Channel is owned by NBC, he went on The Today Show briefly Thursday morning to tease his new show where he was welcomed with open arms and stories of his longtime friendship with Al Roker.

Joining the other team: Sam Champion was an unusual sight on the Today Show this morning after being the weatherman for rival Good Morning America for years

'This is a weather vortex!' co-anchor Savannah Guthrie joked about having both Roker and Champion in the same place after being on competing channels for so long

The scene would have been a difficult one for his former colleagues at Good Morning America to stomach, as media critics regularly attributed their record-breaking ratings coup over the Today Show to the easy chemistry that the GMA cast shared.

The Today Show crew were clearly trying to mimic it with Champion's appearance this morning.

The show's Twitter feed was quick to publicize the visit, posting a picture of the smiling anchors on set.

Warm front moving in: Champion is now running his own three-hour morning show on The Weather Channel which is owned by NBCUniversal as is The Today Show

Excited: Champion said that the goal is to have more people watch The Weather Channel for longer as opposed to their regular consumption habits of tuning in quickly and leaving

Longtime pals: Champion said that Al Roker was his first friend when he moved to New York 25 years ago

The segment only lasted less than three minutes, but Champion used it as a way to show his longtime ties to the network through Roker and his plans for the yet-untitled Weather Channel morning show.

'This is awesome because everyone watches the Weather Channel in the morning- they dip in and they dip out,' Champion explained. 

'We're going to present a really good, focused weather cast with a lot of live events and a lot of pictures from all over the planet of what's going on in the weather that morning. We want people- you know, folks who are interested in the weather- we want them to get that full compliment in the morning.'

Still close: He clearly isn't forgetting his ABC pals as he posted this picture with Josh Elliott just two days ago

While no logistical details about the show have been announced, it is extremely unlikely that Al Roker will be leaving his work on The Today Show to be alongside Champion, but the fact that they are both under the same parent corporation appears to have come as a welcome fact to the ABC transplant.

'We've known each other for 25 years and this is the first chance we've had to actually work together,' Champion said of Roker this morning.

'Do you know when I got to New York and started local news- my very first live shot, I don't know if you remember this- but it was a circus was in town. You were the first person and my first friend in New York because when I moved here, I didn't know anyone, and Al came up and we made friends during that live shot.'
