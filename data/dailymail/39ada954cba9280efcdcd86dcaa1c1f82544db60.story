Prosecutors say a financial fraudster used backers' money to have his wife's body cryogenically frozen before fleeing New York for South America.

That's among allegations in a federal indictment unveiled Friday against Whileon Chay.

Manhattan federal prosecutors say the 38-year-old solicited more than $5 million from people for investment pools, misused and lost the money and bolstered his deceit with bogus account statements.

They say he used some of the money to buy himself luxury cars, among other things.

Cryogenics: Fugitive fraudster Whileon Chay, who scammed 19 victims out of the money in a Ponzi scheme, was upset at the death of his wife, and so had her frozen using money he'd embezzled 

Over $150,000 of the money was used to have his 52-year-old wife frozen after her 2009 death.

It is not known where her body is. 

Prosecutors say Chay fled to Lima, Peru, while under investigation in 2011. 

Neither he nor any lawyer responded to a related 2013 civil case.

There was no immediate response Saturday to a message at a phone number possibly once associated with him.

Because of the indictment, authorities are now able to go after Chay as a criminal fugitive.

The United States has an extradition treaty with Peru. 

Chay's sister told The New York Post her brother just vanished and that she hasn't seen or heard from him in years.

Chay told his clients that he was an expert in foreign exchange, gold and commodities markets.

He promised them a huge 36 percent return and fabricated earnings reports.

He managed to scam 19 investors between 2007 and 2011.
