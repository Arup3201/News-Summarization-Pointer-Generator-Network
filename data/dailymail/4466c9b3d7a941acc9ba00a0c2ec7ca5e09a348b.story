A collection of letters and plans, which chart the construction and design of former US President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie's home in northern Virginia, is set to go under the hammer later this month.

The unique 400-piece archive includes ten letters sent by Jackie to the property's architect, detailing her exact thoughts on what the home should look like - and her delight at the finished product.

'You have done the most fantastic job and everyone agrees,' the then-First Lady wrote in one letter, believed to have been sent shortly after construction on Wexford House was completed in 1963, just a few months before JFK's assassination on November 22.

Family home: Construction on the Kennedys' home in northern Virginia was completed in 1963. Here, the couple is pictured at the property in an archive image from the White House

The finished product: Jackie was determined to make Wexford House the perfect home for her family

Perfection: In her letters to the family's architect, Jackie expressed her thanks for the way in which they completed the house

'That house is really a dream. One could not wish for anything more perfect - if only we could live in it all year long! And Jack [JFK] loves it - so bravo.'

Jackie went on to explain that she had included some images of the property so that the architect could see the finished result, however she added that she would send a further set of photographs in the fall, 'when everything is in place'.

She signs of the letter by saying: 'A million thanks - you can always get me on the phone. Love Jackie.'

Earlier letters included in the collection also provide a glimpse into Jackie's relationship with her beloved husband JFK - who was known to his nearest and dearest as Jack. 

'This house may not be perfectly proportioned - but it has everything,' she wrote in one letter. 'All the places we need to get away from each other. 

'It has everything': The then-First Lady joked that the home had all the space that the family needed 'to get away from each other'

Interior design dreams: The property was designed and furnished to Jackie's exact specifications

Home is where the heart is: Tragically, the Kennedys were only able to spend three weekends together at the property before JFK was assassinated in November 1963

'So husband can have meetings, children watch TV, wife paint or work at desk, nurse [can have] her own room, [the] help a place to sit, all things so [many] bigger houses don't have. I think it's brilliant!'

And while the majority of her correspondence was handwritten on lined yellow notepaper, there are also three letters printed on official White House stationary included in the collection, one of which addresses speculation about when the couple actually planned to move into the property.

It seems that there was great speculation at the time about whether the Kennedys would make the final move into their new home, with Jackie explaining to her architect that they would not be able to visit the property until mid-October, after she had returned from a planned vacation in Greece.

'I cannot wait to see the place in October!' Jackie wrote. 'We will come there the minute I get back from Greece.

'It isn't true at all that we are planning to rent it for another month; I don't know where that rumor started.'

Tranquil: The property was tucked out of the way, far from any prying eyes

Love, Jackie: Some of the letters sent were typed on headed White House stationary 

A suggestion: Along with her letters, Jackie also sent magazine clippings, complete with annotations about which aspect of the design she liked the most

The letter was dated September 30, 1963, meaning it was sent less than two months before Jackie's husband was assassinated while on a political trip in Dallas, Texas. According to reports, the couple were only able to spend three weekends at their new Virginia-based property before he died. 

In addition to her letters, the collection also includes a number of magazine clippings, complete with annotations and notes, which Jackie sent along with her correspondence.

On each cutting she pointed out a design element which she felt would suit their own home - and, perhaps surprisingly, indicated her ongoing desire to keep the budget as small as possible. 

For example, on one picture of what appears to be a living room layout, she wrote: 'This kind of long window [would be] nice for [the] master bedrooms - unless too expensive.

'It makes a good balance opposite a window-door.'

A second cutting even includes a small drawing, indicating how Jackie wanted the sink in her bathroom to look. 

Tight budget: Jackie indicated through her notes that she was mindful about keeping the costs of building the property to a minimum

Personal touch: Jackie even included a few of her own drawings in order to illustrate her ideas

The ideal escape: It seems as though the home was intended as a kind of oasis for the Kennedys

'For my bath - this this kind of sink arrangement. One sink, but space underneath for [a] stool so it can double as a dressing table. Doesn't have to be this fancy marble and woodwork etc.' 

This unique collection of plans and correspondence is due to go under the hammer at the Boston-based RR Auction House on February 19, alongside an assortment of other Kennedy memorabilia, including a selection of photos of JFK and Jackie enjoying a relaxed vacation in Cape Cod with their close friends and family.

The candid images were taken by Washington Post heiress Katharine Graham at Listerine heiress Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon's Cape Cod beach shack in August 1961, just two years before JFK's assassination.

In the images, both Jackie and JFK can be seen relaxing in the company of their holiday companions, including Mrs Mellon and her banker husband Paul, JFK's closest sister Eunice, artist William Walton, Katherine Graham's husband Philip, and three of the Grahams' four children.

In one series of photos, JFK can be seen eating a relaxed meal outside on the deck, while deep in conversation with his host Mrs Mellon. His wife is pictured just a few meters away, seated alongside Mr Mellon.

Intricate detail: The auction lot also includes the final design plans for the property

Every aspect: The plans and designs detail all the different areas of the home

Architectural genius: Jackie was incredibly happy with the final result and added that 'Jack loves it too'

Another set of images shows the then-44-year-old former President enjoying a swim in the bay alongside a male companion, before climbing up out of the water and onto what appears to be a dock, while reaching for a towel. 

According to Pamela Keogh, author of Jackie Style, the images offer an incredibly rare glimpse into the private lives of the Kennedys. 

'They're amazing pictures,' she told People. 

'These were the masters of the universe in their downtime, sitting on beach chairs, smoking and eating clam chowder.

'[JFK] is not in perfect shape and Jackie's wearing a bathing suit your mother might have worn.

'This is not Jackie in French couture. They don't even look like they know they were being photographed.' 

Rare glimpse: Alongside the Wexford House collection, RR Auction House will also be taking bids for a selection of images taken of the Kennedys while they were vacationing in Cape Cod

A rare moment of calm: The photographs include this image of JFK on the dock in Cape Cod

RR Auction House's vice president Bobby Livingston added that images show an entirely different side to the Kennedys - showing them at their most relaxed and happy, and offering a rare glimpse into their lives away from any public scrutiny.

'We've sold many White House photos of the family but they are always posed,' Mr Livingston said. 'You rarely see candid photos of the Kennedys like this.' 

RR Auction House's new collections are just the latest in a long line of memorabilia to go under the hammer.

In October last year, a set of 13 wedding negatives from the Kennedys' spectacular wedding ceremony and celebration fetched $34,000 at auction, while in 2013, a Polaroid picture depicting the exact moment in which JFK was shot went under the hammer in Cincinnati.

Surprisingly, the image, which was predicted to sell for up to $75,000 failed to attract a buyer, but is believed to have later been sold privately.
