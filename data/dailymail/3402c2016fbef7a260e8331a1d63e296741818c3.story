Feeling a bit washed out? You’re not alone – and it could be thanks to low vitamin D levels after our run of gloomy weather, according to research.

Scientists found the ‘sunshine vitamin’ charges up our mitochondria – the batteries of the cells.

An estimated 60 per cent of the population suffer from vitamin D deficiency. But a spell of sunshine lets us produce the vitamin, which helps our muscles work more efficiently.

Benefits: A spell in the sun can top up your batteries and leave you feeling more energetic

Scientists say about 90 per cent of our vitamin D intake comes from sunlight.

And a team of researchers saw exhausted patients report a dramatic rise in energy levels when they started taking vitamin D supplements.

Dr Akash Sinha, who led the study, said: ‘We have proved for the first time a link between vitamin D and mitochondria function.

‘Of the patients I see, around 60 per cent are vitamin D deficient.

Lacklustre: Working indoors all day with little chance of seeing sunshine can create muscle fatigue

Rich source: Vitamin D can also be found in egg yolks, fish and supplements

'Most people living north of Manchester will struggle to process enough vitamin D from sunlight alone.

‘However a simple vitamin D tablet could help to boost your energy levels - from within the cells.’

While it has a well-established association with helping in bone formation and a deficiency can lead to rickets, its role in other health issues is just emerging.

As well as poor bone health, muscle 
fatigue is a common symptom of a lack of vitamin D, which could be due 
to reduced efficiency of the mitochondria.

It is thought around 60% of people in 
the UK are vitamin D deficient, with children under five, people with 
dark skin and the elderly being particularly vulnerable.
