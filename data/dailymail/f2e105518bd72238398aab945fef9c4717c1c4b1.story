For those following brutal low-carb diet plans such as Atkins or Dukan, the holy mantra of comestibles has often been 'bread and pasta are the enemy'.

But spaghetti bolognese might, at long last, be returning to the menu, thanks to the arrival of a supremely high-protein pasta containing half the carbohydrates of regular wheaty brands.

Made from just 
three natural ingredients - pea protein isolate, durum wheat semolina, and fresh eggs - Dr Zak's Protein Foods pasta contains 50g of protein per 100g serving, 309.8 per cent higher than the leading supermarket brand.

It
also has fewer than half the carbohydrates found in traditional pasta - 31g rather than 62g per 100g - so will keep you fuller for longer.

Available exclusively through high protein retailer musclefood.com, the pasta costs £4.95 per 400g and will stay fresh for six months.

Dr Zak released a high-protein bread earlier in the year, with 30.4g of protein per two-slice serving, so carb-deniers are now ever more able to stock their larders as the rest of the population does.

Each 400g pack of low-carb, high-protein pasta, left, costs £4.95, while Dr Zak's high-protein bread, right, costs £4.49 per pack

People who have sampled the pasta and left comments on Muscle Food's website have reported back positively.

User Jo remarked that it is a 'great product and tastes nice too', while Big Dan said: 'I just had 150g serving with diced chicken breasts mixed with sun dried tomato sauce. Wow it went down so easy!

'On top of that it was 125g of total protein in one meal! For someone like me who is 130kg, getting food with such dense nutrition makes life much easier, alongside it tasting lovely means this is a winner!'

Barny wrote: 'This protein pasta is absolutely awesome. In taste and texture it is halfway between white and wholegrain pasta, but has low carbs and high protein. Perfect for the vegetarian in your life!'

High-protein bread means anyone following low-carb diet plans can finally enjoy a sandwich

Darren Beale, managing director of musclefood.com commented: 'Everyone who is trying to lose weight and build muscle knows that a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet is essential.

'However, it's never easy to avoid carbs, especially pasta. For years, dieters and those passionate about fitness have had to forgo of some of their favourite Italian dishes. But now, pasta is back on the menu.

'With its low-carb, high-protein structure, the new pasta releases its energy slowly, keeping you going for longer.

'So a simple chicken and protein pasta meal will provide you with 80g to 100g of healthy, natural protein.

'The pasta is already receiving excellent reviews from customers, with many commenting on the quality of its taste and texture.

'It has an amazing flavour, and is almost indistinguishable from the real thing - because it is the real thing, just better.

'So far the demand for the product has astounded us, we have had thousands of pre-orders prior to launch and we really think it could lead to change in attitude towards weight-loss and muscle-building because pasta is now no longer a nutritional no-no.'
