Child benefit could be docked from almost 20,000 parents every year whose children truant, leaked Tory plans reveal.

Penalties of £60 issued by schools to families whose children are persistently absent would be doubled and taken from welfare payments.

Education Secretary Michael Gove is drawing up the scheme, which is designed to reinforce the legal responsibility of parents to ensure their children attend school from five to 16.

The plan is expected to be included 
in the Conservatives’ election manifesto next year, having been blocked 
in coalition by the Liberal Democrats, although a final decision has not
 yet been made.

The 
proposal is expected to garner strong support, with surveys showing 64 
per cent of voters in favour and only 25 per cent against.

Among
 Conservative voters, 80 per cent say they back the idea. The Department
 for Education defines persistent absence as missing at least 15 per 
cent of school.

Some 41,224
 penalty notices for non-attendance at school were issued in the 
academic year ending in summer 2012 – the latest for which figures are 
available – of which just 22,043 were paid within the time limit of 28 
days.

Under the plan 
proposed by Mr Gove, the penalty for the remaining 19,181 families would
 have been doubled to £120 and automatically docked from their child 
benefit.

Although 
£1.3million a year is raised from truancy fines, ministers say there is a
 problem with their enforcement. Around 82,000 fines – almost half the 
total issued since 2004 – are unpaid.

They lapse if they are not paid in 42 days, forcing local authorities to prosecute.

But 60 per cent of those who fail to pay are never taken to court. 
Charlie Taylor, a head teacher who advised the Government on discipline,
 said taking a parent to court was  ‘cumbersome and expensive’.

Tough: Education Secretary Michael Gove is trying to persuade Tory colleagues to allow the fines imposed on parents of persistent truants to be taken from their child benefit

He
 added: ‘During my review, when I met magistrates, schools and education
 welfare officers, they frequently expressed frustration with a system 
that takes up to six months to get a parent to court.

One
 magistrate explained how parents could exploit the system by pleading 
not guilty, then failing to attend court when they were summoned and 
finally not paying any fine imposed by the magistrate.

‘Parents who allow their child to miss too much school should receive a fine of £60.

If
 they fail to pay in 28 days, the fine should double to £120 and the 
money should be recovered directly through child benefit.

Persistent
 failure to send children to school is a clear sign of neglect and that 
children’s social care services should work with schools to address 
underlying difficulties.

‘The
 best schools work with parents to improve attendance. Fining parents or
 taking them to court is a last resort. However, the system must be 
effective.’ 

The plan is 
thought to have broad support from most Tory Cabinet ministers, although
 some involved in drawing up the manifesto are understood to have 
insisted that vulnerable families were not unduly affected.

It
 is up to local authorities to set the criteria for issuing fines in 
their area. It is also ultimately up to the head teacher to decide 
whether to issue a fine. If a pupil has a medical condition that forces 
them to miss lessons, the school can use its discretion.
