A little girl has gone from foster care to fairy tales as she lives out her fantasies through her dressing up box.

Alice Lewis', 10 from Atlanta, Georgia, dreams became a reality after she was adopted by a photography couple who have encouraged their daughter's penchant for dressing up.

Alice has assumed the identity of Alice in Wonderland, Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz and Joan of Arc, thanks to her photographer mum and cosplay, a performance art which uses costumes and fashion accessories.

Alice Lewis was adopted by photography couple Kelly and James who encouraged their daughter to live out her fantasies through the dressing up box

For years Alice played make-believe while she dreamed of having her own happily ever after with a family, which she found, aged 7, when she was adopted by James and Kelly Lewis.

The mother and daughter began cosplaying almost immediately with the pair first dressing up just two weeks after Alice moved in with her new parents.

Kelly and Alice were shopping when the young girl spotted a Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz dress and her mum asked if she wanted to buy the outfit and pose for a photo shoot in character.

It wasn't just her appearance that Alice wanted to change. With her new life the 10-year-old decided to reinvent herself by changing both her first and last name after joining the family in July 2012. 

Originally named Destiny by her birth mother, Alice thought long and hard about a new name. Kelly, 33, explains that choosing a new name was not a decision that Alice took lightly.

'Once we had an adoption hearing scheduled Alice started practicing her new last name. She then asked us if she could have a new first name as well.

The ten-year-old was originally called 'Destiny' by her birth mother but decided to change her name once she was adopted

'We spent weeks of sifting through the names of various Disney princesses before Alice decided that she wanted to be Alice, after Lewis Carroll's beloved character.

'Alice asked to take on my middle name, as I was now her mother forever, and so she became Alice Elizabeth Lewis.'

Alice says that she finally settled on the storybook name as she saw some of herself in that character.

'I love the character of Alice because she's curious and clumsy. I like it when she is asking herself questions while she's falling down the rabbit hole.'

In celebration of her new name, Alice dressed up as Alice in Wonderland and enjoyed a cosplay photo shoot for her 8th birthday on November 8th 2012.

'We both really enjoy buying the little dresses and props from thrift shops for our shoots.' Says Kelly.

Kelly says that Wonder Woman was Alice's favourite shoot as she was able to wear a wig and do the superhero pose 

'We took the Alice in Wonderland shots in several locations over a few days.

'The photographs of Alice in the room with the checkerboard floor were actually shot in the courthouse where she was adopted.'

Kelly added that she believes that Alice's love of dressing up has enabled her to overcome her painful past. 

'Alice is a very imaginative child. Playing make-believe is how she coped with all of the abuse, neglect, and rejection she's lived through.

Alice's family are very open about her adoption and hope that their story will inspire others

'Cosplaying gives her a creative outlet to express herself and be whoever she wants to be. It's her dream to become an actress.' 

Since the Alice in Wonderland adventure, the mother and daughter have enjoyed many other cosplay photo shoots, where Alice has posed as a variety of characters, including Marie Antoinette, Edward Scissorhands,  and Wonder Woman, which was a particular highlight for the 10-year-old.

'Wonder Woman was Alice's favourite cosplay because she got to wear a wig and do the superhero pose' says her mother.

As photography was a part of Kelly's life before Alice arrived, she already owns plenty of props and outfits that come in handy when cosplaying.

Kelly says that she hopes that Alice's story will help other couples who are thinking about adopting. 

'We're very open about Alice's adoption and she's proud of it.

'If one person is inspired to adopt a child after reading or hearing about Alice's story then it's worth every negative comment from people who don't understand.'

Kelly added that Alice herself is also hopeful that her story will encourage others to adopt.  

'Alice is very passionate about kids in foster care. She independently started writing and illustrating her adoption story because she wants kids to know how great adoption can be.'
