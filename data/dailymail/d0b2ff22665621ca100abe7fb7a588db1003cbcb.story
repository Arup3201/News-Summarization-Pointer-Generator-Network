Nicole Scherzinger expressed her surprise at news Cowell was expecting a child with socialite Lauren Silverman as the show returned to ITV last night

X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger has labelled Simon Cowell’s impending fatherhood ‘crazy’ and said of the mother-to-be: ‘But isn’t she married?’

The 35-year-old pop beauty expressed her surprise at news Cowell was expecting a child with socialite Lauren Silverman as the show returned to ITV last night.

She took her place on the judging panel alongside Take That star Gary Barlow, Louis Walsh and Sharon Osbourne, who reclaimed her seat after a five-year absence.

But Walsh, 61, who says he will leave at the end of this series – his tenth – was more positive about 53-year-old Cowell’s news after spending an evening with him

He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I’ve met Lauren and she is a lovely girl, she is gorgeous. I think it is going to change him in a really good way, it’s going to level him. I went out with him last night and he went home early. He wasn’t drinking, he went back with Lauren.

‘It’s a great reality check for him because he’s a workaholic and Lauren is chilled-out. She is going to be a great influence on him.’

Asked about 36-year-old Lauren’s marriage status, Walsh corrected Nicole adding: ‘No, not any more. She’s great fun and I think she makes him feel younger, that’s what has kept him interested.’

The hit singing competition returned with star performers including 35-year-old female prison officer Sam Bailey, who stunned the audience with her powerful vocals.

Louis also revealed that the show’s judging panel were enjoying the show more after former judge Tulisa Contostavlos was replaced by Sharon.

He added: ‘The atmosphere is much better. Sharon has brought something extra to the show, I can’t explain what it is but she is fun and she is feisty.

‘We all get on incredibly well. She is the catalyst for fun on the show. The atmosphere was quite serious last year. Sharon has brought an amazing difference to the show and we all love her.

‘It’s better when it’s more light hearted, it’s a family show and it’s not all about the singing.’

And he warned Tulisa, who is on police bail after being caught up in an alleged drugs scandal, that she had ‘lost her way’ and been overdoing the partying in recent months – but believed she would rebuild her reputation.
