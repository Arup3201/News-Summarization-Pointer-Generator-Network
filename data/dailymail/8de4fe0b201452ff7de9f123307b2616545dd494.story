It was the age when conservation became a fashionable cause among the middle classes. Indeed, in 1880 many wild birds were granted the protection of the law.

So when Queen Victoria’s eldest son Edward was accused of blasting an owl out of the sky it is perhaps not surprising that he took umbrage.

In fact, he did his very best to hush the matter up, sending an imperious rebuke to the well-meaning individual who had dared to suggest he had shot the protected bird of prey.

The apparent cover-up has only just become known after the letters came up for auction, more than 100 years after they were written.

After King Edward VII is said to have shot a protected owl, well-meaning society snapper John Phillips sent this photograph of the stuffed bird to the Prince of Wales, which includes the inscription: 'Shot by HRH Prince of Wales on the 23rd Sept 1896 at Wynyard Park'

The prince, who was later to become King Edward VII, is said to have killed the owl at a royal shoot in 1896 in County Durham.

Society photographer John Phillips took 
the bird away, stuffed it and sent him a picture of it.

Beneath the bird
was a plaque which read: ‘Shot by HRH Prince of Wales on the 23rd Sept 
1896 at Wynyard Park.’

Rebuke: On Sandringham-headed note paper, the prince got his private secretary to angrily rebuke Mr Phillips and accuse him of inventing the story

Back came a stinging letter from Edward’s private
secretary on Sandringham note paper.
Sent to the estate manager at Wynyard, it read: ‘The Prince… is rather 
annoyed at Mr Phillips.

HRH desires me to point out that he was not at 
Wynyard and also to say that he has not shot an owl for the last 25 
years.

‘Would you mind very kindly asking Mr Phillips what he means by inventing such a story?’

A mortified Mr Phillips, from Belfast, replied: ‘I am extremely sorry to
have caused any dissatisfaction or annoyance to HR Highness. Indeed I 
sent the photo thinking it would be a pleasant surprise and that it 
would meet with HR Highness’s approval.’

Edward’s response was unforgiving: ‘HRH does not quite understand how he
[Mr Phillips] shows his loyalty by inventing something about him.’

At the time, the persecution  of wild birds was also becoming 
increasingly unpopular with the public and was one of the reasons why the RSPB was founded five years later. The Wild Bird Protection Act was
passed in 1880. This might be why Edward denied the claim.

The photos and letters, valued at around £600, go on sale on February 26 with Sworders auctioneers of Essex.

Album: The photographs and letters were made up into an album which was called 'The Wynyard Park Owl and HRH Prince of Wales Oct 23 1896'
