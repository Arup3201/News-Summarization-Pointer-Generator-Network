Arsenal have been given the green light to proceed with a major expansion of their London Colney training ground.

Following a recent Hertsmere borough council planning committee, the Premier League club was granted permission to demolish an equipment store and build a two-storey extension at the club's Green Belt grounds in Bell Lane.

A club spokesman told the Herts Advertiser: 'The plans have to be presented to the Arsenal board for approval. If the scheme goes ahead it will transform our existing training facilities.'

Their bid, which has been supported by Sport England, has been proposed to accommodate first team facilities 'such as space for pilates, yoga and stretching'.

Although relocation of the equipment shed will involve the removal of 140 trees, 280 replacement trees will be planted to cover the loss.

The committee had been advised to approve the scheme due to 'very special circumstances', which include Arsenal's contribution to the local community and providing sporting activities for young people as well as their needs as a professional football club.  

The current buildings  'fail to provide sufficient facilities for strength and conditioning and analytical research which are essential for teams competing at the top level of European football,' a council officer's report said.
