Ivory Coast defender Serge Aurier was hospitalised after a head injury left him convulsing during his side’s 4-1 African Nations Cup defeat by Cameroon.

The PSG full-back knocked his head in a challenge with home captain Stephane Mbia and was then seen convulsing on the ground as both sets of players called for help.

There was no immediate news regarding his situation but manager Herve Renard said: 'It (the injury) is not serious.'

Vincent Aboubakar and Clinton Njie both scored twice in the win at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium as Cameroon continued their rehabilitation after a dismal World Cup.

Despite missing the influence of now-retired captain Samuel Eto’o, Cameroon went top of the Group D standings after starting their campaign last Saturday with a 2-0 away win over the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The Indomitable Lions had returned home in disgrace from Brazil after losing all three games at the World Cup and being involved in unseemly on-field fighting and off-field disputes over money.

Njie scored the opener, as he had on his debut on Saturday, before Yaya Toure equalised but Aboubakar’s 38th-minute effort put Cameroon back in front.

Aboubakar added a second 10 minutes after the break and then in the 75th minute set up Njie for a delightful goal. Njie sprinted on to Aboubakar’s pass, chested the ball and hit a full volley into the net.

The Ivorians, minus the retired Didier Drogba, had to come from behind to beat Sierra Leone at home in their opening qualifier on Saturday.

Ivory Coast captain Yaya Toure said: 'We need to win the remaining four games to go through and that's what we shall work towards achieving.' 

Newcastle's Cheikh Tiote and Swansea's Wilfried Bony also featured in the defeat.

In the other qualifiers, Republic of Congo followed up its surprise victory over defending champion Nigeria with a 2-0 win over Sudan to take charge of Group A. South Africa and Nigeria drew 0-0.

Everton midfielder Christian Atsu’s scored in the 85th minute to lift Ghana to a 3-2 win in Togo, but Uganda is still the surprise leader on goal difference in Group E after it beat Guinea 2-0 at home.

Cape Verde put itself in a good position to reach the African Cup next year in Morocco after a second straight win, this time over 2012 Cup of Nations winner Zambia.

Egypt, the record seven-time African champion, lost 1-0 at home to north African rival Tunisia.
