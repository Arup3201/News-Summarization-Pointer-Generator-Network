Once upon a time, when telegrams were a popular means of communication, Fulham Football Club boasted their own telegraphic address: ‘Fulhamish —  London SW6’.

The years passed and telegrams fell from favour, yet still they clung to the same distinctive title. It seemed a snug fit for that raffish enclave on the Thames; a haven in which success was relished, failure was tolerated and laughter was guaranteed. Not so much an address, more a state of mind. 

Fulham is the place where they erected a preposterous statue to Michael Jackson because he was a chum of the last chairman.

It is the club where, long ago, a blissfully under-talented winger named Tosh Chamberlain was booked for swearing at his captain, the great Johnny Haynes. Tosh was not happy. ‘But he’s on my side!’ he complained. ‘I can call him anything I bleeding like!’

Quite recently, a fans’ forum was asked to define ‘Fulhamish’. One contributor suggested: ‘The ability to mock one’s own and to find humour in shameful circumstances.’ Another offered: ‘In the Hammersmith Road End at Craven Cottage, singing “Let’s all cheer for Torquay” because they’d only brought 20 fans. Then, naturally, Torquay scored. Fulhamish.’

But one fan expressed his fears with considerable candour: ‘Perhaps we have drifted from being Fulhamish to rubbish-ish,’ he said.

What Felix Magath makes of it all, I really cannot imagine. Herr Magath is the third manager Fulham have tried this season, the last one, Rene Meulensteen, having lasted 75 days and 17 games. The new man came wading through carnage at the Cottage, following the dismissals of the coaches Alan Curbishley, Ray Wilkins, Mick Priest and Jonathan Hill. 

Show of emotion: Felix Magath was put through the mill on his first match as Fulham boss

The chairman, Shahid Khan, owns an American Football team called the Jacksonville Jaguars. He paid tribute to the departed quintet in these words: ‘I’m very grateful to Rene, Alan and Ray, as well as Mick and Jonathan, for their commitment to Fulham. Their efforts were admirable and appreciated and I wish them the best.’ It was a classic of effortless insincerity.

The appointment of Magath, who has not worked in management since October 2012, represents Khan’s final shot at getting it right. The mass sackings, and consequent compensation bills, were gestures which only a billionaire could afford. Some of his surviving senior employees may have privately  queried the wisdom of allowing Meulensteen to buy five players on deadline day, including an £11million Greek striker, then firing the manager three weeks later. But, since Khan pays the bills, they never raised their voices.

And anyway, the future belongs to Felix. This is a man who, in the course of a substantial managerial career, has acquired a reputation for being a pitiless trainer; drive them hard, success through sweat. It is a notion he does not discourage. A few of Fulham’s underachievers will have winced at his much-quoted justification: ‘Until now, everyone has lived through my training. No one died.’ 

Pedigree: Magath won the German cup during his stint with Bayern

He is doubtless aware that such an attitude will win him public favour, since the public perceives footballers as being both overpaid and underworked.

And yet Magath needs to be much more than a martinet if Fulham’s survival is to be achieved. Just about every gym in the country contains people capable of pushing athletes to their limits; it takes the talents of a teacher, an educator, an innovative coach to improve the skills which deliver results.

Soon, we shall discover if Magath possesses those qualities, or if his hard-driving reputation represents the real man. The evidence is conflicting. ‘I’m a nice guy. I’m very nice,’ he insisted, with the smirk of a pantomime villain.

Stephane Henchoz, one of his former players, said: ‘I understand where his critics are coming from but to call him Saddam Hussein is a bit strong,’ which is possibly not quite the compliment he intended.

But the recent remark of Uli Hoeness, the renowned German international forward and current president of Bayern Munich, remains curiously disturbing. Hoeness, who once worked with Magath at Bayern, said: ‘I would never want to treat human beings the way he does.’

Time will tell. By the middle of May, they could be raising a statue to Felix in the place where Jacko once stood. Or the chap from the Jacksonville Jaguars could be forming a new firing squad.

Because of what the club have been and what they have meant to the English game, we must wish them well. But we must also be forgiven a small shudder at the behaviour of those who are in control.Ruthless, pragmatic, uncompromising methods may go down well in certain Premier League boardrooms. But they are neither humane nor admirable. And they are certainly not Fulhamish.

The most disturbing image of the sporting week was that of Manuel Pellegrini waving an imaginary card and frantically pleading for the booking of a Barcelona player.

At the time, Manchester City were being slaughtered by a side playing with style and flair and exhilarating freedom. Pellegrini looked like a man trying to open a brolly in a hurricane. Later, after City had been soundly beaten, he would launch into a ludicrous diatribe against the referee. He was ‘not impartial’. He was inexperienced. Worst of all, he was Swedish.

‘It was not a good idea to put a referee from Sweden in charge of such an important match,’ said Pellegrini, with the desperate air of one who does not really expect to be taken seriously. Now, this is standard behaviour for the managerial tribe, whose members stagger along that fine line between sanity and chaos.

Even Arsene Wenger, the very best of them, can succumb to hand-fluttering outrage, as he did when losing his goalkeeper to a stern but defensible decision in Arsenal’s tie with Bayern Munich. Yet Pellegrini’s tantrum was particularly disturbing, since it hinted at an unsuspected weakness in  a substantial man.

Sixty years old, a graduate in civil engineering, he retired from a distinguished playing career to work in reconstruction projects in the Chilean earthquake zone. His subsequent managerial journey took him to some of the biggest clubs in Argentina, Chile and Spain. He is a proper coach who builds proper teams. And yet, just a few weeks back, he seemed rattled by the puerile provocations of Jose Mourinho.

It was unclear why this formidable man should be affected by the taunts of such a tedious troll but Chelsea’s League victory at the Etihad created the kind of tremulous uncertainty that even City’s subsequent FA Cup success could not erase.

Of course, he has time to demonstrate that the card-waving was not a trend but a lapse. Yet it remains an unsettling image.

We had hoped that Pellegrini was immune to that kind of nonsense. We now know that he is as mad as all the rest.

Graeme Swann is to join Test Match Special for England’s forthcoming tour of the West Indies.

The mantle of John Arlott and Christopher Martin-Jenkins thus falls upon a former spinner and full-time ‘character’ who deserted the England team after they lost the first three Tests of the Ashes tour.

A BBC executive promises: ‘Graeme will bring genuine insight to the audience… as well as his trademark sense of humour.’

The idea of inflicting that ‘trademark sense of humour’ upon TMS listeners is truly dispiriting.

Still, there is always the chance that, after three matches, he will be on his way.

Now on their third manager of the season, will Fulham erect a statue of Felix Magath come May?
