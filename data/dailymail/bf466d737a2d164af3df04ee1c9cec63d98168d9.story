A woman with eyes like 'fireballs' was locked up today after stabbing her boyfriend six times in a drink-fuelled frenzy.

Caroline Humphries, 48, from Homerton, East London, was jailed for 16 years after she plunged a knife into Chris O’Connor’s side and back.

He desperately tried to protect himself but he was left lying in a pool of blood in the unprovoked attack at her home, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

Humphries, who has been locked up 
twice before after attacking her lovers, denied wounding Mr O'Connor 
with intent. She claimed she acted in self-defence.

Humphries was convicted by a jury on July 17. But she was cleared of two counts of causing actual bodily harm after two further alleged attacks on Mr O'Connor.

Jailing Humphries, Judge Martyn Zeidman QC, said: ‘In drink, you are a very, very dangerous woman and there is absolutely no doubt you need to be put away in prison for a very long time.'

‘That’s to punish you, to protect others and to demonstrate that domestic violence is not acceptable.'

‘There is no distinction between it being a man on a woman or a woman on a man. All domestic violence has to be taken very seriously.'

‘Your wrongdoing falls into the most serious category of offending.'

‘This was a sustained attack upon your boyfriend with a knife in which you stabbed him a number of times.'

‘As he said in his statement, you were out of control and your eyes were like fireballs.'

‘You made such a big error of judgement in pleading not guilty to this offence.'

‘There is no substance whatsoever in your dishonest suggestion of self-defence.'

‘Hurt and injury are not limited to physical matters - just think what you have done to this man.'

‘He says he feels his life has changed for the worse and he has flashbacks. This has also exacerbated his drinking problem very severely.'

‘The most significant aggravating feature is you have previous convictions for violence that are in a worryingly similar context.’

Humphries has been jailed twice before for stabbing lovers, Snaresbrook Crown Court, pictured, heard

In 2004, Humphries was sent to jail for 30 months after stabbing her partner Paul Owen. A year later, she was sentenced to three years after puncturing her former lover Robert Irvin’s chest and slashing his face.

Humphries was also charged with attempted murder in 1999 after she allegedly stabbed another lover three times in the neck, the court heard.

But the charges were dropped after he claimed he had ‘fallen against a fence’.

Judge Zeidman warned Humphries: ‘The risk of you offending is so high in relation to serious offences that you do qualify for an indeterminate sentence.'

‘But I have reached the conclusion that if the sentence is long enough, there will be a long period of licence that will be sufficient to protect the public on your release.'

‘There will be a sentence of 16 years in prison, it means you will serve eight years then be released on licence.'

‘But if you put a foot wrong, you will be straight back inside.’

'If you ever do this again you are likely to receive a life sentence.’
