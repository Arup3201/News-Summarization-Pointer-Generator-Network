The son of notorious mob boss John Gotti walked into a Long Island hospital bleeding claiming that he had broken up a fight in a convenience store parking lot.

John Gotti Jr., 49, took over the Gambino crime family but now says that he is no longer involved with organized crime, but he refused to tell police about the fight that he reportedly broke up on Sunday night that led to him being stabbed.

The New York Post reports that he was calm and polite when he walked into Syosset Hospital asking for a doctor.

Shady circumstances: John Gotti Jr (pictured here in 2011) was stabbed over the weekend and when he sought medical treatment, he said it was from trying to break up a fight

He initially said that he was injured while trying to stop a fight between two strangers in a CVS parking lot. 

'He's being very uncooperative. He says these guys were fighting and he jumps in and is this big savior and he gets stabbed in the stomach,' and unidentified official told ABC News.

No details have been released about his condition or the specific injuries he sustained, but the Daily News reports that they were serious enough for him to be transferred to North Shore University Hospital.

He stopped revealing any details as soon as police arrived, putting an end to one information stream.

'He didn’t say anything to us so there was really no lead to track down at that point,' an unidentified police source told The Post.

Out of the racket: Gotti Jr was the subject of four federal trials between 2005 and 2009 but all ended in mistrials and he said he now no longer participates in the Gambino crime family (pictured in 2006)

Gotti has not only clammed up when it comes to law enforcement, but also to his own lawyer as attorney Charles Carnesi told the paper that he had not heard from his infamous client about the incident.

With the limited leads that they have to pursue, police are now left looking for surveillance footage and speaking to CVS employees to see if there will be any charges.

Gotti has been tried four times since 2005 for racketeering. Each trial ended in a hung jury, leading many to say that he was following in his father's footsteps since John Gotti senior earned the nickname 'Teflon Don' after being acquitted in numerous trials.

'Junior' said he left organized crime in 1999.

All in the family: John Jr and his sister Victoria turned to television after Victoria launched a reality show

Of all the Gotti children, John Jr. is the only one to follow his father into a life of crime. By 1982, John Jr. already had become a Gambino Family 'associate,' and by 1990 he had been named a 'capo' in the organization.

In regards to her son's career with the mob, Victoria Gotti told the New York Daily News in 2006 that she felt 'betrayed' that her husband had dragged their son into a life of crime.

'I pretty much raised my children alone with Johnny being away for years at a time, so it broke my heart. I felt betrayed, the worst betrayal. I would rather have dealt with other women,' she told the paper.

The Gottis' daughter Victoria starred in the A&E reality TV series Growing Up Gotti, which chronicled the lives of the former mafia don's grandchildren Carmine, John and Frank. The series was canceled in 2005 after 41 episodes.
