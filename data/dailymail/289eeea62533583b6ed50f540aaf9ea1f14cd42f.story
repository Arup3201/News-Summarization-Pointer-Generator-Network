An American astronaut has offered a rare look inside the International Space Station, with a unique video tour showing viewers his intergalactic workplace.

Beginning at one end of the ISS, Reid Wiseman, from Baltimore, Maryland,Â floats through the station in just over a minute and a half as he explains its different rooms.

As he enters one area, Russian religious icons can be seen on the wall behind him, offering a glimpse of a rare personal touch in the highly-functional station.

A narrow tube-shaped hallway connects the station's laboratory, crew quarters and dining area.

Mr Wiseman is greeted by Russian cosmonaut Maxim Surayev in the dining area, which resembles most of the other sections of the station.

The tour also offers a glimpse at the close-quarter manoeuvres astronauts must adopt to function inside the ISS, which travels at a rate of 18,000 mph.

Breathtaking: Wiseman's photos from the space station have proved hugely popular on Twitter

'Butch, go high,' Mr Wiseman says as he floats beneath his fellow ISS resident, making sure the two don't crash into each other.

He ends the brief tour on the front side of the station, roughly 200ft from the back end.

Mr Wiseman has become a Twitter sensation since he joined the ISS crew. He has shared hundreds of photos of Earth from outer space and now has 361,000 followers.

His photos have frequently been used on NASA's official website as their 'photo of the day'.

He is due to return to Earth this weekend after spending 165 days orbiting the planet.
