'Light touch': Theresa May has secretly abolished passport checks for foreigners entering the UK on certain flights

A second relaxation of border controls authorised by Theresa May has allowed thousands to enter Britain without passport checks, it emerged today.

The 'smart zone' system was quietly introduced at Luton, Gatwick, Birmingham and Leeds/Bradford  airports last year.

It means some passengers are security-screened before take-off and face only a 'light touch' inspection on their arrival.

The minimal checks have resulted in those on 'low risk' routes into the UK passing through border control in half the time previously taken.

The system makes it easier for illegal immigrants, criminals and terrorists to enter the country unchallenged.

The new rules were revealed by the Daily Telegraph with the Home Secretary already under fire for a separate, secret move in the summer to relax passport checks at all airports.

'Smart zone allows us to pre-check people on low-risk routes and, 
therefore, to provide a faster, lighter-touch, screening of passengers 
at the port,' said the UK Border Agency, in a report seen by the newspaper.

'This is better for passengers and allows
us to use our staff’s expertise at spotting the unknown risk, rather 
than routinely processing documents.'

The report shows the Home Office are putting an end to the processing of passports and other travel documents for selected 
flights, the newspaper said.

Insiders claim the tactics could pave the way for full-blown profiling of travellers based on race, according to the Telegraph.

Further trials of the system are planned for Bristol, Liverpool and Manchester airports, and some coach parties arriving from Calais have been ushered in under the relaxed new policy.

The French coastal city is a notorious entry route used by people-trafficking networks, who have been known to charge migrants up to £5,000 to smuggle them into Britain.

Mrs May faced three days of grilling this week over her involvement in disgraced ex-border chief Brodie Clark's reckless relaxation of passport checks.

The Home Secretary admitted she authorised a pilot scheme relaxing checks on EU nationals, but insisted Mr Clark had gone much further without her knowledge.

Fighting back: Border chief Brodie Clark is suing the Home Secretary for constructive dismissal, as he claims she knew all about his relaxations of security controls

Mr Clark, who is bringing a six-figure lawsuit against Mrs May for constructive dismissal, argued that Mrs May was aware of all his actions.

Over the summer, he allegedly allowed the
suspension of checks on non-EU nationals, and let staff stop checking 
against a warning index of terror suspects and illegal immigrants.

During tense exchanges in the Commons on Wednesday, Mrs May admitted that an internal Border Agency document leaked on Monday did ‘reflect government policy’.

It showed that staff were told to ‘cease routinely opening the chip’ within biometric passports from EU nations.

She also agreed to suspend so-called warning index checks for children travelling with an EU passport with their family or on a school trip, sparking fears that a trafficked child could slip through the net.

Mr Clark will give evidence to MPs next week which could cause further trouble for Mrs May following calls for her resignation this week.

Labour MP Simon Danczuk yesterday asked Sir Gus O’Donnell, the head 
of the Civil Service, to investigate the conduct of Mrs May’s aides in 
relation to Mr Clark.

Damian Green, the immigration minister, said in parliament that UKBA was reviewing its processes.

He said: 'Smart zones are one part of this and operate by using information 
gathered through the e-Borders system [a programme that collects electronic records of everyone entering and leaving the country] to conduct enhanced watch-list 
checks in advance of arrival.'

'Passengers are then directed through a designated smart zone where the 
appropriate level of checks can be made on arrival. This has the 
potential to remove duplication of detailed checks at the border, improving the passenger experience while maintaining border security.'

A Home Office evaluation of the smart zone scheme is due next month. 
Whitehall officials said feedback from UKBA staff, airlines and 
passengers had been positive.

UKBA was unable to comment today.
