When they moved into their purpose-built £50million offices, the council staff of Rochdale had high hopes for the lavatories.

Instead, the new facilities caused a revolt – because they are unisex.

Some workers at the new headquarters were aggrieved at the idea of men and women using the same cubicles.

Now, the gender ratio on each floor of the building will be analysed before individual toilets are allocated proportionately as either male or female.

Flashy: But Rochdale council's new building is only equipped with unisex bathrooms, leading to staff anger

It all adds up to the town’s biggest 
toilet fiasco since its shopping mall introduced squat loos in the name 
of cultural sensitivity three years ago.

The new offices, named Number One Riverside, were built to accommodate 2,000 council staff.

Boss: Rochdale council's new building was overseen by chief executive Jim Taylor

However, the first batch of workers to transfer to the new building were shocked to find it lacked  separate toilet facilities.

Helen Harrison, Unison’s Rochdale branch secretary, said council staff have raised concerns.
‘People do have different views on it but there are a number of people who are upset about the unisex issue,’ she said.

‘I think what the council is looking at doing now is tallying up the 
ratio of male and female workers on each floor and will split up the 
toilets that way.’ Each floor of the building has around eight toilet 
cubicles opening off a corridor, all currently with male and female 
symbols on the door.

'They are fully enclosed with their own washing and drying facilities, rather than communal ones.

Nevertheless some staff have apparently baulked at the idea of using cubicles frequented by members of the opposite sex.

Last night Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance,
said: ‘It’s bizarre that council bosses pressed ahead with unisex loos 
despite a clear lack of demand for them.

‘This is a perfect example of politically correct thinking trumping common sense at the expense of everyone else.’

Unisex toilets first entered the public consciousness in the 1990s 
American TV series Ally McBeal where they were the setting for gossip 
and romantic encounters between her lawyer colleagues.

As a compromise, cubicles at Rochdale council’s building will now be allocated as male or female.

Operational services director Mark Widdup said: ‘The building was 
intended to have unisex toilets on the office floors, as is the norm in 
many modern buildings.

Controversy: The building was only equipped with unisex toilets rather than men's and women's

‘However, based on staff feedback who have been based in the building 
for several weeks and discussions with the unions, we’ve decided to 
review these facilities.’

The building also houses the town’s new library and has space for 
private firms. The council says it will save £1million a year by having 
workers in one modern location as well as giving a better service to 
local people.

In 2010 there was amazement when Rochdale’s Exchange mall installed two 
squat toilets after bosses were told some of the town’s Asian and 
Eastern European communities preferred them.

Rochdale is far from the only council to have wasted taxpayers' money on perks which turned out to be useless.

Last month, Banbury council came under fire for spending £10,000 on a replica of the mayor's ceremonial gold chain.

Eight
months ago, Crawley council in Sussex paid £630 to translate its 
newsletter into Urdu for the benefit of just one resident who complained
about not understanding the promotional document.

And
in 2011, workers at Ashford council were treated to a day out at a 
high-wire adventure course, with taxpayers shouldering the £750 bill
