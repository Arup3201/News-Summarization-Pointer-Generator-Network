Pupils at one of London's top pre-prep schools have been banned from having nuts for breakfast at home in cases it triggers a reaction in fellow classmates.

Eaton House Belgravia School in London, which has tuition fees of £13,320-a-year, sent a letter to parents saying children must not have peanut butter or cereals with nuts during the week.

The strict policy has been put in place because the school claims some pupils have 'extreme allergies' where even the smell could trigger a severe reaction.

Rules: Eaton House Belgravia School in London has told parents not to let their children eat anything containing nuts for breakfast because the smell could trigger an allergic reaction

The private school, which takes boys between the ages of four and eight, has also asked children not to bring in sandwiches or yoghurt for their break because they could be 'messy' in the classroom.

Headmistress Miss Lucy Watts said in her welcome letter at the start of the year: 'Owing to some extreme allergies, please do not give your son anything like peanut butter or cereals containing nuts for breakfast during the week as this can have an effect on boys with allergies.'

Many schools in the UK have already prohibited children from bringing products containing nuts into schools, but Eaton House has gone one step further, extending the ban to morning meals at home.

A charity which supports people with 
severe allergies is against such bans in schools because it threatens to give children a 'false sense of security'.

The Anaphylaxis Campaign said: 'There is a strong case for arguing that food-allergic children will gain a better awareeness of their allergies, and learn avoidance strategies, if they move in an environment where allergies may turn up unexpectedly'

Miss Watts said she had received no complaints from parents since the stringent policy was introduced.

She told The Daily Telegraph: 'We've had boys with allergies so severe that, even if they're sitting next to someone who has eaten something like nuts or dairy, that can cause a reaction.'

Facts: Around one in 100 people in the UK suffer from a nut allergy, with most being children

Peanuts are among the most common allergy-causing foods and affect around one in every 100 people in the UK.

Although a small amount of peanut protein can set off a severe reaction, it is rare for a reaction to be triggered just from breathing in small particles of nuts or peanuts.

Most foods containing peanuts do not allow enough protein to escape into the air to cause a reaction and, according to website TeensHealth, just the smell of foods containing peanuts won't produce a reaction because the scent does not contain the protein.

The allergy to peanut and tree nuts is the most common found in adults and children.

However, since most children start eating other foods first, allergies to other foods such as egg and cows' milk protein typically present before nut allergies.

While children often grow out of other allergies, only around 20% of children with nut allergies resolve.

This means that 4 out of 5 children with nut allergies will continue to have these allergies as an adult. In some people, the allergy may become less severe with age, but in 20%, it can become worse with time.
