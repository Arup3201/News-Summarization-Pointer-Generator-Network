As one of the biggest red carpet moments of an A-lister's career, getting it right at the Oscars is enough to make anyone break out in a sweat.

So it's no surprise those celestial, designer-dress-adorned bodies are the product of intense and gruelling workouts in the months running up to the star-studded event.

Ever wondered how they do it? Women's Health magazine quizzed the personal trainers behind previous Oscar winners' honed physiques.

Reese found her 1955 vintage Dior dress in a Paris boutique, but even she worried about going sleeveless, so her trainer Matthew Reyes helped her target her shoulders, upper arms and obliques.

'The one body part women fear is a flabby underarm. A dress like Reese's required focus on the triceps, biceps, shoulders and waist,' her trainer Matthew Reyes told the magazine.

Reese got red carpet-ready with a 5km jog three times a week, and by heading to Matthew's YogaHop class.

'It's a 60-minute class that combines yoga moves with cardio and body-weight strength training,' he explains. 'It works all your major muscle groups.'

Sandra's dazzling lace and satin Marchesa number left no margin for error.

It was all about the side profile, so her trainer Simone De La Rue helped her work on her arms and hips.

'The best moves for achieving a sleek silhouette are a combination of strength training and cardio,' said Simone, who uses a fusion of Pilates, strength training and cardio dance moves to get her clients into shape.

'The strength training tones and sculpts the muscles, while cardio strips the outer layer of fat.

'Just 10 minutes of interval training elevates your metabolism. To maximise muscle gain, eat some carbs and protein an hour before you work out,' she advises.

Smouldering in her Valentino gown, Julia had to work hard to ensure she was honed for the smaller vintage sizes.

She called on Kathy Kaehler - who she's trained with for 20 years - to help her work on her shoulders, arms and hips.

'In the lead-up to that day, we did a lot of push-ups and planks,' reveals Kaehler, working her shoulders, chest and upper arms.

'They're the best moves for upper body conditioning if you don't want to bulk up. We also worked out in her pool to mix it up a bit,' says Kathy.

Halle's Burgundy Elie Saab gown with sheer bodice was a daring move, one which required focus on abs, back and shoulders.

But, of course, she pulled it off with aplomb - and it only took five minutes a day, according to her long-time trainer, Harley Pasternak.

'She was my inspiration for the five-factor training method. We worked out five times a week for 25 minutes, each day working a different part of the core.

'At home, spend one day working the upper abs, then the lower abs the next day, then the obliques, then the lower back.

'Stability exercises strengthen the major parts of our core and improve the way we look by creating a longer, leaner silhouette.'
