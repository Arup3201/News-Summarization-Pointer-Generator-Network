Cristiano Ronaldo's Mykonos getaway is over after the forward was spotted at the Greek island's airport.

The 29-year-old had spent some time on the Mediterranean tropic with friends as he looked to take his mind off his country's disappointing World Cup campaign.

The Portugal captain was unable to inspire his side beyond the group stages of this summer's showpiece in Brazil as Paulo Bento's side finished below Germany and the USA in their group.

The former Manchester United man has some time off to relax and recuperate from the knee injury that troubled him throughout the tournament in Brazil before heading back to Madrid for pre season training.

And he looked in good spirits on Wednesday night, posing for photos with a smile that fans rarely got to see on Portugal duty this summer.

Ronaldo will be hoping to fully recover from his injuries in time to start the season with Real in late August.
