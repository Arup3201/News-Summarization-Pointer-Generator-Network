A shocking video has emerged showing dozens of football hooligans fighting in the street near the Etihad Stadium after Sunday's Manchester derby.

The violence occurred an hour-and-a-half after Manchester City's 1-0 victory when a group of United fans threw bottles and a red smoke flare at Blues fans drinking at The Eastlands Bar.

Some City fans on a terrace at the back of the bar, on Albert Street in Beswick, ran out to confront the United mob with both sides throwing chairs and other missiles.

The rival fans kicked and punched each other, with up to 100 involved, as sickening insults were exchanged.

The clash was captured on a two-minute long video by a City fan and posted on YouTube.

A 48-year-old man, believed to be a City fan, was left with a broken nose, cuts and head injuries after being punched and kicked while on the ground. Paramedics attended but he declined hospital treatment. 

Police arrived shortly after the fight and arrested one man using a chair as a weapon. Four others were arrested nearby and all five have been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police confirmed the incident happened at 4.45pm, about 90 minutes after the match ended, and that officers attended Stanley Road in Beswick.

Police had issued 35 'dispersal orders' ahead of the match to prevent known trouble-makers attending.

City won the match courtesy of Sergio Aguero's second-half goal after United's Chris Smalling had been sent off.
