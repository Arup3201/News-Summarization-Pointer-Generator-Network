A huge collection of First World War memorabilia has been
discovered stashed away at the home of a real-life ‘Miss Havisham’ who died two
years ago.

Vervia Todd died aged 92, in November 2012, in the house she
was born in - leaving behind an Aladdin’s Cave of dresses, hats and shoes worth
£100,000.

Her home had been in the family for 200 years and, when she
died, it was found virtually untouched and packed with antiques and curios
dating back decades.

Sheila Ellis, a local historian who was Vervia Todd's best friend, discovered the hoard of First World War memorabilia in the attic of the three-storey County Durham house

Historian Sheila Ellis said: 'We found piles of boxes containing war memorabilia - there's everything from magazines to tin hats with bullet holes in. If people want to know what their grandparents and great-grandparents went through in the 20th century, they should have a look in here'

Vervia Todd's house, which is filled with dust-covered antique furniture, has been turned into a workshop over the past year after the collection of vintage clothing worth £100,000 was discovered

It was thought all the antiques and items of vintage clothing, which went on to be sold, had been discovered but historians have now uncovered a secret hoard of war memorabilia.

Local historian and best friend Sheila Ellis made the discovery after finding an undiscovered loft area of the 12-room house.

Sheila discovered piles of boxes containing German propaganda, war-time copies of newspapers, postcards sent from the trenches, tin hats and war time rations.

It is thought all the goods were collected by Vervia’s dental surgeon father, Sam.

The goods will now be catalogued and put on display ahead of the home being sold, although it is not yet known what will happen to the treasure trove of items inside.

Sheila said: ‘It’s a big house and it has taken a lot of sorting out. It all has to be cleared and to be honest we though we’d found it all.

Vervia's father's First World War service cap complete with a Medical Corps badge was one of the items found in the First World War memorabilia hoard. Vervia lived alone after her fiance and father both passed away

The huge collection was discovered in the loft of the twelve-bedroom house belonging to Vervia Todd. It reveals she invested a lot of time gathering and collecting First World War memorabilia including artifacts of that era, right, and dozens of war-time copies of newspapers, right

The huge hoard is so extensive it even features a First World War trench scene, left, and numerous artifacts specific to the war

One of the items discovered in the hoard in the wake of her death included a framed picture of Vervia taken during the Second World War

‘But in a loft area we found piles of boxes contains war memorabilia - there’s everything from magazines to tin hats with bullet holes in.

‘I think Vervia would be chuffed to bits and thoroughly enjoying it.

‘The house was always full of people and she was very generous. We could have put on an exhibition four or five times as big.

Vervia, who was 92 when she died last November, was born in the three-storey house in Houghton Le-Spring, County Durham.

She had developed a secret obsession with fine clothing after the death of her fiancé during the Second World War.

Last year, a huge amount of vintage dresses were discovered at Vervia Todd's home in County Durham. The vast collection, which no one realised existed, took 13 months to organise and the dresses were eventually sold on

She travelled abroad each year to develop her collection, but kept her amazing wardrobe a secret.

The house gradually fell into disarray - stuck in an eerie time capsule reminiscent of Miss Havisham’s decaying mansion in the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations.

The doors of the house are now open to the public, who have already flocked there for two vintage sales, to snap up Vervia’s collection of dresses, hats and shoes.

Vintage dealer Paula Donaldson, who has been working with vintage clothing for around ten years, had never come across such a colossal collection when she was shown Vervia's array of clothing and shoes
