The bodies of a newborn and another 'mummified' stillborn have been discovered hidden in a box in the ceiling of an Indiana funeral home.

The gruesome discovery was made at Smith, Bizzell & Warner Funeral Home, in Gary, on Wednesday.

It is thought babies had been stashed in the ceiling of the home's morgue for years - although it is unclear why, and police say foul play is not suspected.

The stillborn may have been concealed for almost two decades, as papers found with it suggest it was born in March 1996, according to the Chicago Tribune.

The identity of a woman is also said to have been revealed in the papers. 

The other baby - a boy, according to Eyewitness News - is thought to have been born in March 2012, according to a hospital bracelet it was wearing.

It may have died when it was a few months old. 

Police have emphasized they are still investigating the circumstances surrounding how the babies came to be hidden above the ceiling tiles.

But a spokeswoman for Concord Family Services, which has owned Smith and Bizzell since 2005, denied they had been hidden in the ceiling. 

She told the Tribune the babies were stored 'in the morgue', and the home had simply been trying to ensure they had a proper final resting place.

The spokeswoman went on to tell Eyewitness News that both babies - which she described as 'unclaimed fetuses' - had been at the home since before Concord Family Services purchased the business.

According to its website, Smith, Bizzell & Warner has been 'serving the community' for more than 90 years, and boasts it is the only funeral home in Gary which is a member of the Order of the Golden Rule'.

'Membership of the "Order of the Golden Rule" simply put, says you are the "best of the best" in funeral service,' the website explains.
