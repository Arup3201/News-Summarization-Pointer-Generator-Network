The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has so far killed more than 9,300 people

It is a debate that has been raging since the Ebola epidemic reached crisis point last year.

Will the vicious disease, which has killed more than 9,300 people, mutate to become an airborne virus potentially making it infinitely more deadly?

Health experts have firmly proclaimed Ebola viruses are not airborne and can only be transmitted through direct contact with infected bodily fluids. 

But an international team of scientists have now thrown that assertion into doubt.

In an opinion piece published in mBio, the journal of the American Society for Microbiology, the team make their case.

They reviewed past studies examining past outbreaks of Ebola within human populations, as well as animal studies.

Their aim? To establish what is known and what is not known about how the virus spreads.

And their findings conclude, that while current knowledge is nowhere near complete, airborne infectious Ebola particles are likely to play some role in transmission. 

'It is very likely that at least some degree of Ebola virus transmission currently occurs via infectious aerosols generated from the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract, or medical procedures, although this has been difficult to definitively demonstrate or rule out, since those exposed to infectious aerosols also are most likely to be in close proximity to and in direct contact with an infected case,' they wrote.

They go on to suggest that Ebola viruses do have the potential to evolve in the future into airborne pathogens, 'particularly if extensive ongoing human transmission results in selective virus evolution'. 

But Professor Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Reading told MailOnline Ebola remains a blood borne infection and as a result is very unlikely to spread through airborne particles.

He said he has 'absolutely no issue at all' that if you were to generate some droplets contaminated with Ebola, they could be a potential source of infection, because of the route the virus takes via mucus membranes. 

But, he cautioned, it is a 'leap of faith' to suggest the virus can therefore be transmitted via an airborne route.

'The reality is that this virus ends up in the blood stream, that's where most replication happens,' Professor Ball told MailOnline. 'It is a blood borne virus, therefore it is difficult to say how the virus could set up the lung associated infections which would generate the symptoms associated with respiratory transmission, through sneezes and coughs.

'The bottom line is if you say airborne to the general public they start to immediately think the virus could be spread through someone coughing.

'The reality is there is no evidence it is changing the way it behaves.' 

Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading agreed.

He said the possibility Ebola might travel through the air is 'interesting from scientific perspective', but he warned 'talking about it as if it is actually happening in Africa right now would be irresponsible speculation'. 

He told MailOnline: 'The study in question poses some interesting "what if" questions for researchers to ponder, and we shouldn't get carried away. 

'Ebola is just not well adapted to spreading except by contact with bodily fluids.'

As part of their analysis Dr Osterholm and colleagues noted a few animal studies have pointed to the possibility that Ebola could potentially spread via aerosols.

One piece of research revealed two monkeys developed the virus 10 and 11 days after the death of infected monkeys kept in an enclosure three meters away.

Those infected with the disease were housed in the same room but efforts were made to ensure they were separated from the control group of three monkeys.

The researchers suggested the two control monkeys had been infected through aerosol, oral or conjunctival exposure to droplets carrying the virus.

They added that studies of the dead monkey's lung tissue supported the theory they had become infected via airborne particles.

Similarly in another study, four caged macaques monkeys became infected with Ebola after being placed close to six infected piglets.

The animals were separated by a wire barrier, and the piglets were kept at least 20cm from the macaques' cages at all times.

The researchers concluded that while the virus could have spread through airborne particles, other routes were also possible, including droplets landing on items in the cages. 

Experts assessing past studies looking at how the virus spreads, have concluded that airborne transmission of the virus is 'very likely at some degree'

But, in contrast, Dr Osterholm and his team did also note another study where two monkeys did not contract Ebola despite being placed next to two infected animals in open-barred cages for several days. 

The team's argument hinges on the need, they believe, for a revision of the traditional ideas around how viruses are transmitted.

Currently it is accepted that transmission happens in one of two ways.

A new test that can diagnose Ebola in just 15 minutes has been approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

The ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test Kit is based on detection of the Ebola protein in the blood.  

WHO said the test is rapid, easy to perform and does not require electricity.

'It can therefore be used at lower health care facilities or in mobile units for patients in remote settings,' the UN health agency added. 

The new method is less accurate than the Nucleic acid tests (NATs) that have previously been used but offers a far quicker way of identifying the disease.

The agency said NATs require established laboratories and fully trained personnel and can take between 12 and 24 hours.

When compared with the results of an NAT previously listed by WHO and currently being used in the field, the new test was able to identify about 92 per cent of Ebola infected patients and 85 per cent of those who were not infected with the virus.

The agency said it is therefore recommending that where possible, results should be confirmed by using an NAT as well.

Dr Ben Neuman, lecturer in virology at the University of Reading, said: 'The new antigen test is not a game-changer, but it is another useful tool in the fight against Ebola.

'The new test is small, cheap and portable, but is less sensitive than the gold-standard test that is used to diagnose early-stage Ebola in the clinics now. 

'The new test could help to quickly confirm outbreaks in remote areas without the need to send samples to a testing clinic and wait for results. 

'The new test isn't about saving the lives of infected people, but it can help in the long run by making it easier and quicker to detect Ebola outbreaks.'

Either large droplets make direct contact with the skin or a mucus membrane, or a person becomes infected with a virus by inhaling small airborne particles at a distance from the source. 

But the authors say these models fail to recognise that infectious aerosols 'include suspended particles in a wide range of particle sizes that are easily inhaled by someone standing near the point of generation.

'Thus, aerosol inhalation can occur both near and far from an infectious source'. 

They note that vomiting caused by norovirus is known to produce infectious aerosols that cause the illness to spread.

But add, norovirus is not thought of as a respiratory virus.

They believe that could also be the case for Ebola, because infectious suspended particles may be generated by vomiting, diarrhoea and coughing.  

To test their theory, Dr Osterholm and his colleagues created Ebola virus aerosols and sought to find out their decay rates.

Their findings estimate that the Zaire strain, that triggered the epidemic in West Africa, can survive in suspended airborne particles for around 100 minutes. 

Despite their assertion that Ebola could already be airborne, Dr Osterholm and his colleagues acknowledged direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected patient remains the primary way the virus spreads.

They noted the virus has been found in saliva, breast milk, urine, and the semen of sufferers.

Meanwhile they also found viral DNA has been found in sweat, tears and stools, as well as in rectal, conjunctival, vaginal and skin swabs.

And the authors note that the available data on how Ebola spreads is very limited, leaving their findings uncertain. 

They said the evidence available currently does not show the disease to be a primary lung infection.

But they add it is worth asking whether this could happen in the future, noting it could be possible because the virus can be isolated from saliva and can infected cells found in the respiratory system. 

Dr Osterholm and colleagues ultimately agree with the recognised advice that airborne transmission of Ebola is unlikely because it would require the virus to mutate significantly.

But, they add, 'with phenotypic changes (physical or biochemical characteristics of the organism) in the virus, aerosol transmission... involving droplets of various sizes from cases in relatively close proximity to uninfected persons remains plausible'.

Admitting the epidemic still ever present in West Africa took public health officials by surprise, they warned 'we should not assume that Ebola viruses are not capable of surprising us again at some point in the future'. 

In October the World Health Organisation stated Ebola is not an airborne infection and added it is not likely to become one. In a statement officials said airborne transmission 'has not been observed during extensive studies of the Ebola virus over several decades'

Dr Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, sparked the debate last September, in an opinion piece in the New York Times.

He put forward the idea that Ebola viruses could mutate to become transmissible through the air.

Acknowledging that public health experts were talking of the possibilty behind closed doors, for fear of generating hysteria, Dr Osterholm warned 'the risk is real, and until we consider it, the world will not be prepared to do what is necessary to end the epidemic'. 

Such was the level of concern, that the World Health Organisation, responded.

The agency said Ebola is not an airborne infection and was not likely to become one.  

'Airborne spread among humans implies inhalation of an infectious dose of virus from a suspended cloud of small dried droplets,' a  statement said.

'This mode of transmission has not been observed during extensive studies of the Ebola virus over several decades.' 

Dr Osterholm, from the University of Minnesota, worked with experts from other US academic institutions, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Doctors Without Borders, and the WHO.
