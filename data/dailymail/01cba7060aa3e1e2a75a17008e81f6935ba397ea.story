Wigan boss Uwe Rosler has praised Jack Collison's Premier League experience after signing the midfielder on loan from West Ham.

As Sportsmail revealed on Monday, the Wales international has joined the Championship side until the end of the season and he is eligible to feature in the Latics' FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal next month.

Collison will bolster Rosler's squad ahead of their Wembley showdown with the Gunners and their attempts to secure promotion back into the Barclays Premier League.

Rosler said: 'After we lost Ben (Watson), Chris (McCann) and Roger (Espinoza), we have now brought in two great signings in Ryan Tunnicliffe and Jack Collison.

'Jack is exactly what we needed, he can play in a few different positions, has terrific experience of both the Premier League and the Championship and will heighten competition for places as we move into the crucial last few weeks of the season.'

Collison is Rosler's sixth signing, joining Ryan Tunnicliffe, Martyn Waghorn, Nicky Maynard, Josh McEachran and Markus Holgersson at the north-west club.
