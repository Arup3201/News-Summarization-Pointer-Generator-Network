A distraught truck driver has lost a legal battle with his doctor, who he claimed amputated part of his penis without his consent.

A U.S. jury has ruled in favour of Dr John Patterson, who removed part of the organ after finding potentially-deadly cancer during surgery in 2007.

Philip Seaton, 64, and his wife, Deborah, were given the verdict by a jury today after filing the lawsuit in Shelby County Circuit Court in Kentucky.

The jury ruled against claims that Dr

consented to the amputation.

'Everyone agrees that Phillip Seaton (has) the right to decide what is going to happen to his penis'

Dr Patterson had gone into the 
surgery intending to perform a circumcision but decided to remove part of the organ.

Mr Seaton had been seeking up to $16million in damages for ‘loss of service, love and affection’ after his ‘manhood was taken’.

‘Phillip has changed,’ his lawyer Kevin George, said in closing arguments. ‘He was mutilated. His manhood was taken.

'Everyone agrees that Phillip Seaton (has) the right to decide what is going to happen to his penis.'

Evidence: Hundreds of medical documents were filed with the court and the jury saw graphic pictures during the case before a verdict was reached

He plans to appeal the decision on 
the grounds that a doctor can change consent for surgery only if there 
is a danger of imminent death.

'I pulled the dressing down, and I 
didn't see nothing. Then I came out of the restroom 
and I said: "I'm getting the hell out of this damn hospital”'

‘There was no emergency, no reason to do it,’ Mr George claimed.

Dr Patterson said after the 
verdict that he was ‘feeling pretty good’ and his lawyer, Clay Robinson,
said they felt ‘justice was done’.

Dr Patterson claimed he saved the 
man’s life. 'What I saw was not a penis,' he said
during an earlier hearing. 'What I saw was cancer.'

He removed less than an inch of Mr 
Seaton's penis, but the rest of the penis was later amputated by another 
doctor, the defence told the court.

However, Mr Seaton said he was appalled at 
the doctor's decision to amputate without consulting him, or giving him 
the opportunity to seek a second opinion.

In earlier testimony, Mr Seaton described the moments after being told part of his penis had been removed.

'I pulled the dressing down, and I 
didn't see nothing,' said Mr Seaton.

'Then I came out of the restroom 
and I said: "I'm getting the hell out of this damn hospital”.’

Dr Patterson testified that the cancer prevented him from inserting a catheter into Mr Seaton's urethra.

He was concerned about the possibility of kidney damage from urinary retention.

Mrs Seaton testified that if the 
doctor had consulted her after finding the cancer, she would have told 
him to halt the surgery and wake him up.

'It's his body,' she told the court. 'He should have a say in it.'

The jury was shown graphic images and Mr George told them that Mr Seaton 'doesn't feel like a man' anymore.
