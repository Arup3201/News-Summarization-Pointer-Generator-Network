Manchester United supporters flew their 'COME HOME RONALDO' banner over Villarreal’s El Madrigal stadium but the Real Madrid striker only had eyes for goal as he scored his 10th league goal of the season in a 2-0 win.

Ronaldo is the first player to reach double figures inside the first six weeks of the season in the last 60 years of La Liga. With 187 league goals for Real Madrid he also enters their top 10 league scorers list in just five seasons at the club.

It was as the biplane circled over-head with that message for Ronaldo that the Portuguese striker got Real Madrid’s second goals.

And it was the killer blow to break Villarreal’s resolve. Luka Modric had scored the first on 32 minutes with a shot from outside the area but the home side had plenty of chances to still be in the contest until Ronaldo grabbed the second from a fine counter-attacking run and pass from Karim Benzema.

Casillas saved a Manu Trigueros shot and Uche blazed the rebound embarrassingly over with the goal gaping. The offside flag had been raised but the Nigerian striker had not seen it and it was a miss that summed up Villarreal’s first half.

Young Argentine striker Luciano Vietto was always a threat but he just couldn’t find a finish as Villarreal played passes around Real Madrid’s defence but lacked the lethal penetration that the visitors showed at the other end.

Real Madrid had come into the game on a run of scoring 18 goals in three games and they had Gareth Bale up against Brazilian Gabriel playing out of position at left back because of the absence of Juame Costa and Jokic.

The game marked the former Tottenham man’s return to the scene of his debut 377 days before.  

Gabriel blasted over with the first attack of the second half and when former Barcelona youth-teamer Jonathan Dos Santos came on he tested Casillas with a long shot from distance but there was no way through for Villarreal even with the introduction of Giovani Dos Santos.

Villarreal were without Denis Cheryshev. The talented Russian left winger is on loan from Real Madrid and they would have had to pay 250,000 euros to name him against his parent club. 

That didn’t help their cause going forward and they had been made to pay for their lack of a finisher. Real Madrid have theirs, and his relentless march up the club’s all-time scorers table just goes on and on.
