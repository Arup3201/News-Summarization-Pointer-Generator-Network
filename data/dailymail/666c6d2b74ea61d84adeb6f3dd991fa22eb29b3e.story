Frantic: The nine-year-old boy can be heard screaming down the phone for help from his home in Manchester while his mother is beaten in the background (file picture)

The harrowing moment a nine-year-old child calls 999 - begging for help as his mother is beaten by her partner - has been released by police.

Agonising screams can be heard by the youngster's mother as the boy frantically pleads with the call-handler in Manchester to send help.

He can be heard shouting 'please, please send the police' while another child cries uncontrollably in the background.

On the other end of the phone, the operator keeps asking the scared youngster: 'Does your mum need an ambulance?'

Officers then went to the scene but neither parent would give any information 
about the incident and said they did not want any police involvement.

Greater Manchester Police have released the recording of the horrifying call as part of major campaign against domestic violence before the World Cup starts.

In another call, a distressed women tells the operator how her husband threw her up against the wall, 'trashed' her television and threatened to take her son away.

When England got knocked out of the tournament four years ago, the force saw a 40 per cent increase in 999 calls - many for domestic violence.

And they are warning offenders that extra officers are being drafted in to crack down on violence - as well as urging victims to get help.

A recent study has shown domestic incidents increase by more than a third 
when England loses a World Cup match - but also rise by 26 per cent when
 the team wins.

As a result forces across Britain are drafting in 
extra resources, launching hard-hitting poster campaigns and even paying
 personal visits to known offenders.

In Essex 117 fans, seven of them 
women, will reportedly be handed warnings after officers analysed their 
history of domestic and footballing crime.

A
 similar tactic is being employed in Northumbria, where officers warn 
they will be paying 'special attention' to people who are known to be a 
risk.

Officers are also set to visit known domestic abusers this week with ‘yellow cards’ given out warning them against violence.

They will also be speaking to previous victims urging them to get help if violence flares again with extra officers on duty while England matches are on.

Chief Superintendant Vanessa Jardine from Greater Manchester Police said: 'We know historically there is a big increase in domestic abuse incidents [during the World Cup].

'When England got knocked out four years ago we had 350 999 calls made - a 40 per cent increase - and many of those were regarding domestic violence.

'There will be people living in fear, dreading the World Cup starting because of this and that’s a dreadful way to live.

'We know victims often suffer in silence but there is help out there and we would urge people to give us a call.'
