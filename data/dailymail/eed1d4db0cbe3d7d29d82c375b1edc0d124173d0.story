A prisoner who murdered a Good Samaritan while on day release was allowed to walk out of the open jail without a proper review due to a number of security blunders, it has emerged.

Ian McLoughlin, 55, butchered Graham Buck, 66, while on day release from HMP Springhill in Grendon Underwood, Buckinghamshire, where he was serving a 25-year jail term for murder.

He had also already served a long sentence for manslaughter prior to his latest killing in July last year, which came after prison staff allowed him to be ‘released on temporary licence’.

Nick Hardwick, the chief inspector of prisons, said a number of ‘procedural’ failings resulted in the criminal being allowed out as part of preparations for his eventual release.

He said there had been a ‘failure to undertake a formal risk assessment’ of the killer and told the justice secretary that it was not appropriate for him to have been released.

An inquiry into his release found that staff did not review his offender assessment system on his arrival at the Category D prison and concluded that staff should have considered his criminal past before allowing his temporary 12-hour unsupervised release.

McLoughlin killed Mr Buck on July 13 last year - the first day he was eligible for day release during his sentence for murder.

Within hours of hitching a lift from the prison, McLoughlin went straight to the house of Francis Cory-Wright, 87, an Old Etonian he met in prison two years earlier while Cory-Wright was serving a 30-month sentence for indecently assaulting a ten-year-old boy.

As McLoughlin filled a pillowcase with family heirlooms and cash from the victim’s £1million Hertfordshire home, Cory-Wright shouted for help from a window. 

Mr Buck went over to investigate and was confronted by McLoughlin, who dragged him inside the house and slashed his throat.

He committed the crime while already serving a jail sentence for murder, after he stabbed his Brighton landlord Peter Halls to death in 1992.

It was only 17 months prior to that killing that he had been released from prison, having been jailed for ten years for manslaughter in 1984. 

Aged 25, he admitted admitted to police he had done a ‘bad thing’ after crashing a car while drunk.

Officers then went to the home of Len Delgatty, 49, from Stoke Newington, North London, and found his body upside down in a cupboard, with his skull smashed in seven times with a hammer. The house had been ransacked for cash.

McLoughlin was charged with murder but was found guilty of manslaughter, after he claimed he had attacked Delgatty – who had served time for having sex with teenage boys – only after he told him of a fantasy for under-age sex. He was released after five years after behaving as a ‘model prisoner’.

The full report into his release and those of two other offenders at different prisons will be published in full when an ongoing trial involving one of the men has concluded.

Ian John McLoughlin, also known as Ian John Baker, has been described as ‘astonishingly bright’, with an IQ of 140.

Born in Lancashire in 1958, he spent much of his youth in care homes and picked up a string of convictions for petty theft and burglary.

By his early 20s he was a drifter, reportedly earning money as a rent boy and sleeping rough when his cash ran out.

He briefly married at 25, but his marriage collapsed under the strain of his heavy drinking and his continued involvement in crime and prostitution.

In October 1983, he was stopped by police after crashing a stolen car in London while drunk.

Kept in a cell to sober up, he demanded to see the custody sergeant and told him: ‘I’ve done a bad thing.’

McLoughlin had killed a gay man, Len Delgatty, smashing his skull seven times with a hammer before strangling him with a towel.

At his trial, McLoughlin told the jury that Delgatty, 49, – who had previous convictions for sexually abusing teenage boys – had played him an audio tape describing a graphic sexual fantasy of having under-age sex with a teenage boy.

McLoughlin claimed he had ‘panicked’ and repeatedly struck out at Delgatty. He said he had thrown the tape away.

The jury convicted him of manslaughter, not murder, and he was sentenced to 13 years, reduced to eight on appeal. He was released in 1989 after serving only five years.

Just 17 months later he stabbed gay barman Peter Halls, 55, through the neck at his home in Brighton.

In July 1992, he was convicted of murder and given a life sentence, with a minimum tariff of 25 years.

McLoughlin’s 25-year minimum term would have meant he was eligible for release on licence in 2017 but he was moved to a Category D ‘open resettlement prison’ so he could prepare for life outside.
