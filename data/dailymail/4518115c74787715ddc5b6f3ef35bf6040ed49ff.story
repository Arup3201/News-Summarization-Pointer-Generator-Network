Joshua Dean Wilson, 23, of Harrogate, is wanted by North Yorkshire Police as they believe he may have information about the student's death

Police are looking for a man after a female university student was found dead.

Officers say they want to speak to 23-year-old Joshua Dean Wilson after the body of a 24-year-old woman was discovered in an upmarket spa town.

Harrogate police were called to the rear of a semi-detached house where they found a body.

Today officers said they needed to speak to Mr Wilson, who lives in the town, who they believe saw the woman shortly before she died.

Post-mortem results have so far proved inconclusive and they are treating the death of as unexplained.

The young woman is believed to have been a student at Leeds University.

Detective Chief Inspector Andrea Kell, said: 'We are treating the woman's death as unexplained at this time and it is vital that we piece together her final movements.

'Our investigations so far reveal that Mr Wilson was one of the last people to see her alive and it is vital that he gets in touch with us.

'I am appealing to Mr Wilson to contact us without delay along with anyone who knows of his current whereabouts or has any information which could help our investigation.'

The woman's body was found behind Brandon Lodge, a house of six flats in Harrogate's Lancaster Park road.  The house is said by neighbours to be owned by a local housing association, where residents tend not to stay too long.

One neighbour said he saw a policeman 'on a mission' running towards the stone property on Wednesday, the day the body was discovered.

He told MailOnline: 'We saw one policeman running like mad, his helmet under his arm, going down our street and trying to get through to the back of Brandon Lodge.

'I said to my family "He looks like he's on a mission", and the next we knew all hell broke loose, with police cars, an ambulance, and the house being cordoned off.'

Police found the body of a 24-year-old female student behind this building in the leafy spa town of Harrogate on Wednesday

He said the property caused endless problems in an otherwise smart street.

'Just at the weekend there were 
people from inside chasing each other with a fire extinguisher, and 
we've had an arsonist, a flasher, a prostitute and endless drugs 
problems - not a week goes by without the police visiting the house.

'If a private landlord ran their property like that, they'd be closed down.  It's scandalous.'

A police spokesperson said: 'We are not yet in a position to release the name of the deceased, however she is believed to be a student from Leeds University.'

A spokesman for Leeds University said he was still trying to corroborate the report that the young woman was a student there, but he said there were no university buildings or lodgings in Harrogate.
