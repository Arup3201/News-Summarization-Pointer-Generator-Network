A woman whose husband died after being locked in a store cupboard in a burning building has admitted his killing on the second day of her murder trial.

Julie Dixon had originally denied killing popular businessman David Twigg, 46, during a fire at a workshop in Burgh Le Marsh, Lincolnshire in March last year.

But yesterday afternoon, on the second
day of her trial at Lincoln Crown Court, she admitted killing him, a 
spokeswoman for Lincolnshire Police said.

Killer: Julie Dixon has admitted murdering David Twigg after he died in a fire at a workshop after she locked him in a cupboard

Dixon had previously told police that the couple were attacked by masked intruders at Mr Twigg's bespoke joinery business.

She later changed her story and told police her partner had died following a failed joint suicide pact on March 13 at Mr Twigg's workshop.

Following the plea change, Dixon will now appear at the court for a Newton hearing.

A Newton hearing occurs when the defendant has pleaded guilty to the offence, but on the basis of a different version of facts from that of the prosecution.

Mr Twigg died after inhaling smoke from the intense fire at the workshop, which was located next to his home.

The court had previously heard that 43-year-old Ms Dixon had concealed huge debts and eventual bankruptcy from Mr Twigg.

She was responsible for looking after the books and paperwork at the couple's joinery business which Mr Twigg had worked 'tirelessly' to make a success.

When the business began to fail she kept the full extent of the problems from him, the court heard.

After her arrest on suspicion of murder in June prosecutor Gordon Aspden said she gave a statement to police in which she said she and Mr Twigg had formulated a joint suicide pact but she had lost her nerve at the last moment when the fire started.
