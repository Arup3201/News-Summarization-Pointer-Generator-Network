Germany have suffered a blow ahead of their World Cup quarter final clash with France after it was revealed a number of the squad have been hit by illness.

Seven members of Germany’s squad are reported to be suffering from flu, coach Joachim Low confirmed that the players were ‘slightly ill’.

Low attempted to play the issue down, betraying only that most of the affected players had ‘sore throats’.

‘It’s not that bad at the moment,’ he said, ‘I don’t want to over-dramatise it.’

But given the number of players it has affected, there are concerns that the issue may be more serious than Low is letting on.

Mats Hummels and Christoph Kramer are considered to be among those suffering after Hummels missed Germany’s second round tie against Algeria, while Kramer sat out an entire day of training this week.

Hummels, certainly, was hit by more than a sore throat, with Low admitting that the Dortmund star was bed ridden for the Algeria match, his condition having worsened the night before.

Thomas Muller is also suspected to be among those affected. His coach admitted that the Bayern forward had shown 'symptoms of the flu' even before Germany’s last game.

As for the reasons for the sudden plague, Low blames the climate in Brazil, and the constant necessity to travel.

‘We’re constantly having to travel 
between different climate zones,’ the Germany boss complained.

'It’s 
understandable that the guys get a bit under the weather, and that it 
starts to spread.'

Germany have certainly seen some extreme weather during their stay in Brazil. For their opening game against Portugal, they were forced to endure thirty degree heat, while their win over the USA was played out in the flooded city of Recife.

It is a particularly sensitive issue for this German team, given that fitness has been one of the major issues surrounding their World Cup campaign.

Several of their key players, including Sami Khedira, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Miroslav Klose, arrived in Brazil having only just returned from long term injury.

With Shkodran Mustafi ruled out of the rest of the tournament, and seven other players gripped by what the Germans call ‘Grippe’, Low’s hopes of having a team at 100 per cent physical fitness are now little more than a pipe dream.
