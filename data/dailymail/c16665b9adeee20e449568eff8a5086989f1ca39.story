It was a tale of our times played out on the pages of social  networking sites.

Kelsey Shaw was 12 and Callum Willcocks 14 when they started going out together.

Within two years they had a child and  their relationship was already scarred by drug abuse, binge drinking and allegations of infidelity.

Teenage mother: Kelsey Marie Shaw, killed by boyfriend Callum Wilcocks, and her 3 year old baby Caitlin

And by the time Kelsey was 17 she was dead – strangled by Willcocks in an  alcohol-fuelled row over claims of  sleeping around.

In the words of his barrister, ‘they 
were much too young, both of them’. Stuart Driver QC added: ‘It was a 
disastrous cocktail, because they had powerful adult feelings but the 
immaturity of children.’

Yesterday at Chester Crown Court, Willcocks was jailed for a minimum of 16 years after being convicted of murder.

The jury rejected his claim of 
diminished responsibility as a result of borderline personality 
disorder. Defence experts claimed this explained his disruptive 
behaviour at the many schools he passed through and propensity for 
starting fires and reckless driving.

Wilcocks and Kelsey were described as having a volatile relationship

However a psychologist called by the 
prosecution said his state of mind had more to do with his 
self-confessed consumption of a bottle of spirits a day and £1,000 worth
of cocaine every weekend.

Willcocks met Kelsey in Speke, 
Liverpool, only a year after she had started secondary school, and 
within 12 months he had made her pregnant. He was already a heavy 
drinker and had been thrown out of ten schools which could not cope with
his ‘extreme anger problems’.

Their daughter Caitlin was born in 2008 when Kelsey was 14 and Willcocks 16.

A few months later, Kelsey wrote on 
MySpace how she could not wait to leave school and enjoyed ‘goin out 
with tha girls drinkin n all tha’. Telling how she adored their 
daughter, she added: ‘love my callum 2 bits as well there both amazin.’

By now, Willcocks had dropped out of 
the education system and was using cocaine and high-strength cannabis, 
paid for by car theft and burglary.

In 2008 he was given three years’ 
detention for supplying crack cocaine and heroin, a separation which 
fuelled what would be  persistent and overwhelming  suspicion that 
Kelsey was unfaithful to him.

Saying he could not face their child 
being raised by another man, he wrote on MySpace that he hoped she would
have a nice Christmas ‘cus i no i wil of bin away n kiled meself by 
then’.

He attempted to take a drug overdose and later tried to hang himself with his bedsheets, but was rescued by prison staff.

On his release in 2010, to the alarm 
of Kelsey’s family, the relationship resumed and Willcocks got a job at a
skip hire firm. But far from bringing him stability, it helped him 
afford a drug habit which had spiralled to spending £1,600 on cocaine 
every weekend with friends.

Not surprisingly, the relationship remained chaotic.

‘When it was good it was brilliant, 
but when it was bad it was absolutely terrible,’ Willcocks told the 
court, admitting he had slept with Kelsey’s cousin.

Kelsey Shaw had told Callum Wilcocks their daughter wasn't his during a heated argument

‘We often had fights, hitting each other. There have been times when we have both called the police on each other.’

Kelsey – who had gone on to college –
became pregnant by him again, but in the spring of this year she had an
abortion, saying she was seeing a man called Roy and wanted to break 
up.

Willcocks called her to say he was 
about to hang himself by the River Mersey, but after she pleaded with 
him he came home. On April 28, the eve of Prince William’s wedding to 
Kate Middleton, they spent the evening at a friend’s flat in Widnes. 
Kelsey was drinking alcopops while Willcocks downed vodka on top of 
around eight cans of Stella Artois lager he had drunk earlier in the 
day.

The following day, he told the court, she accused him of being an ‘alkie’ and he held her neck until she passed out.

When she came round, he said she 
taunted him, saying neither their daughter nor her aborted baby had been
his and telling him: ‘You are a s*** sh*g, Roy is ten times better’.

‘I was filling up with anger and I couldn’t hold it any more,’ he told the court.

‘I just exploded.’ He strangled her again, leaving her lying unconscious, and she died in hospital the following day.

'They had powerful adult feelings but had the immaturity of children' the court was told

He told police: ‘I wanted her to die.
I felt she had to get out of my life. If I was sober it probably 
wouldn’t have even entered my mind. But I was off my head big time.’ The
jury took just an hour to reject the 19-year-old’s plea of manslaughter
on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Kelsey’s mother Patricia, who is 
looking after Caitlin, said she accepted the sentence, adding: ‘All I 
know is he can never hurt my beautiful girl any more.’

She went on: ‘Kelsey’s death 
devastated the whole family and has left a huge hole in our lives. To 
have her taken away from us so suddenly is something we have all 
struggled to deal with, but we have had to stay strong for her little 
girl  who has been left without a mummy.’

On Facebook, a friend of Kelsey 
wrote: ‘CALLUM WILCOX u sik evil twistd t***, how cud u murder the 
mother of ur bby girl now she has to grow up noin her daddy killed her 
mummy!!

‘RIP KELSEY shud be plannin ur 18th 
not ur funreal! u wer so young an guwjus everyones thinkin of u my heart
gose out to ur family n babby girl RIP xxxx.’
