Alex writes open letter to Kieran, urging him to never buy the model 'cheap necklaces' and 'grow a thick skin'

Leandro claims he never proposed, only agreed a ring he had bought the model was 'engagement ring' to stop her crying

They've remained unusually quiet since their ex-love Katie Price wed Kieran Hayler two weeks ago after only a month of dating.

However, the glamour model's ex-husband Alex Reid and ex-fiance Leandro Penna have both broken their silence with their opinions on her shock marriage.

Argentine model Leandro, who only ended his engagement with Katie in October 2012, believes his ex-fiancee is 'insecure' and claims she rushes into relationships in a bid to make her feel settled.

Like Alex, Leandro was unaware of Katie's marriage to Kieran on January 16 in the Bahamas until he read about it in the newspapers.

Leandro, 27, told this week's Now magazine: 'I wasn't upset. But I was, I think the world is, flabbergasted.

'Katie's a very insecure person. I think she feels more secure and safe in a marriage.'

Meanwhile, Alex, 37, has written an open letter to Kieran in the same magazine, urging him to not get too used to his newfound fame and to keep his old friends.

The cagefighter claims his 11-month marriage to Katie left his confidence destroyed, alleging she regularly belittled him and tried to tell him how to dress.

He writes: 'We had a fight and then she said: "It isn't all about you. You'll never be as famous as me."

'She didn't like my clothes... Katie can switch things on and off. Being with Katie is like Jekyll and Hyde.'

Alex also urged Kieran to 'grow a thick skin' and 'don't trust anyone at all'.

But after the two page letter, the father-of-one insisted he 'genuinely' wished Kieran, 25, and Katie, 34, all the best in their marriage.

Meanwhile, Leandro claims he never properly proposed to Katie, insisting he only said they could get engaged after she grew emotional.

He claimed he bought Katie a Â£10,000 promise ring from Harrods and when she accepted it, she asked if it was an engagement.

He said: 'I said it wasn't and she asked again. She had tears in her eyes... I didn't want to upset her, so I agreed.' But I never got down on one knee or asked her: "Will you marry me?"'

Katie and Kieran only went public as a couple on December 18 when the part-time stripper published a photo of the couple kissing at Bluewater shopping centre in Kent on his Twitter page.

Although Katie claims she knew Kieran for a year before they started dating two months ago, Leandro says he had never heard or seen him during his 20 month on/off romance with the ex-Page 3 girl.
