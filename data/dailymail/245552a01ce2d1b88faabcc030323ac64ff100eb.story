The names of alleged student rapists at Columbia University have been shared by students in on-campus bathrooms - less than a month after 23 students collectively filed federal complaints against the university for mishandling sexual assault cases.

Four students' names were written inside a Hamilton Hall bathroom stall and leaked to the Columbia Lion last Thursday by a tipster. The paper says that those names were listed in 'four distinct styles of handwriting, which suggests multiple authors.'

The alleged rapists' names were quickly removed by facilities staff, who deemed it 'graffiti,' according to the report.

However, the same names were found written in a Lerner Hall bathroom stall on Monday that appeared to be written by only one person, the Lion reports. Though a tipster sent in an image of the list at 5:30pm, the names had been removed within the hour.

Less than 24 hours later, an identical list of alleged rapists' names appeared inside women's bathrooms on both the second and sixth floors of Butler Hall, the Lion reports. The sixth floor Butler Hall list was reportedly written in the same silver marker as the Lerner Hall list.

As of this writing, the names are reportedly visible in the sixth-floor stall.

Flyers of the rapists' names were also distributed in toilet paper containers and photos of them were leaked to Jezebel.

The flyers list one 'serial rapist,' as well as three rapists 'found "responsible" by the University.'

The students include 'a musician, a prominent writer for a campus publication, and a varsity athlete' and are current students, Jezebel says.

Jezebel's information coincides with a statement that campus news site Bwog released Monday, which says a member of their editorial staff agreed to resign over allegations.

'On May 7, allegations that a member of our staff had violated Columbia University’s Gender Based Misconduct policy were brought to our attention by an anonymous tip,' it says.

'As a reiteration of our continued work against rape culture, we have taken steps to ensure that the makeup of Bwog’s staff, without question, reflects this. Accordingly, we asked this staffer to permanently and immediately resign from their position, and they agreed.'

The lists come just weeks after 23 Columbia and Barnard students filed a 100-page federal complaint against the University on April 24, citing Title IX, Title II and Clery Act violations, the Columbia Spectator reported at the time. 

In the wake of the allegations, nearly 100 faculty and staff members signed a letter on Bwog that supported the students' complaints.
