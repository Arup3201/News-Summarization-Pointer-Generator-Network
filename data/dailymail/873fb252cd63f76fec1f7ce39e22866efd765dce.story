He enjoyed this one. Beaming smile, arms outstretched and sliding on his knees into the corner flag, revelling in the adulation that was showered upon him.

Steven Gerrard had scored 176 goals for Liverpool before Tuesday night, including strikes that defined European and domestic finals, but No 177 seemed different, sweeter almost. It was, perhaps, a reminder of his ability to produce just when it matters.

With all the speculation surrounding his contract, all the conjecture about whether he will stay at Anfield or pursue a fresh challenge next year, Gerrard could not have provided a more telling riposte when he burst into Leicester City’s area in the 54th minute to settle a game Liverpool needed to win.

Can they ever be without him? In a word, no. Gerrard may be in the autumn of his career but he was a towering presence at The King Power Stadium, driving his team forward relentlessly. Without him here, another two points would have been squandered.

‘It’s not about me,’ he pointed out. ‘It should be about a great team performance.’

Gerrard can argue the praise should be spread but Liverpool are unbeaten in three games – their best sequence of the campaign – thanks to him, his goal sandwiched by strikes from Adam Lallana and Jordan Henderson after Leonardo Ulloa raised the prospect of a shock.

This is exactly what Brendan Rodgers – and his captain – required. Restored, as expected, to the starting line-up after a weekend break, he was left in no doubt by the fans in the visiting section over his place in their affections.

His name was sung loudly and frequently, the songs drowning out barbs from Leicester’s supporters: do no doubt the vast majority of Liverpudlians want him to prolong the relationship they have shared into a seventeenth campaign.

Liverpool’s ambitions, though, should not be so intrinsically linked to Gerrard. At 34, he should not be carrying the team. Others have to take responsibility, not least the expensive acquisitions who arrived during the summer as part of the restructuring programme. 

That is why Rodgers will have been satisfied to see Lallana score Liverpool’s opener. Things may not have not been smooth since he left Southampton but this was more like it, his second goal of the campaign coming at just the right time.

Crisp and instant, it was a terrific left-foot finish, drilled in after Wes Morgan headed Lucas Leiva’s high-ball into his path. There looked to be some fury in his fist-jabbing celebration but, on the bench, Rodgers only briefly acknowledged it. What had happened five minutes prior had dulled his mood.

A significant part of Liverpool’s troubles so far have stemmed from an inability to keep clean sheets and – more accurately – their bewildering ability to give away cheap goals. Never was this more evident than here.

Rodgers’ idea is to have a goalkeeper who is comfortable with the ball at his feet and give assurance to his defence but Mignolet is doing nothing of the sort at present, his performances a constant worry to his manager and team-mates.

He had been ordered to go back to basics in the 1-0 win against Stoke – make saves, give it simple – but none of those instructions were carried over and a ridiculous error in the 19th minute almost handed Leicester the lead, when Mignolet gave the ball straight to Esteban Cambiasso.

The Argentine could not make him pay, his left foot shot zipping fractionally wide, but the reprieve was only temporary as in the next attack Leicester had the lead. Liverpool, farcically, failed to clear their lines when defending a counterattack. 

Jamie Vardy caused the trouble, sprinting at Liverpool’s back four. Mignolet was weak and needed Martin Skrtel to head Vardy’s shot off the line but he couldn’t gather the rebound and Ulloa profited, his left-foot drive ending in the net via rebounds off the post and the back of the Belgian’s head.

Shaking his head in disbelief, Mignolet stood with his hands on his hips, smiling ruefully. This, however, was no laughing matter. The longer he continues to be found wanting, the more vulnerable his side will be. It is an issue Liverpool must address.

On this occasion, it didn’t prove costly. High on endeavour and brimming with determination, Leicester did not play like the worst team in the Barclays Premier League but every error they make is being ruthlessly punished.

Nobody knows that better than Morgan. Having teed up Lallana, he provided the ‘assist’ for Gerrard to gleefully smash home in the 54th minute, after he tried to cut out a centre from Sterling after Lallana and Henderson had combined. It was his first goal in open play since January 28.

Morgan’s night reached its nadir on the hour when his weak back pass allowed Rickie Lambert a free run at goal. Floundering, Morgan yanked Lambert’s arm back and sent him sprawling and gave referee Lee Mason a simple decision. Red card, game over.

Leicester should have been down to nine when Kasper Schmeichel collided with Gerrard but frustrations were only temporary. Schmeichel erred in the 84th minute, Sterling cut the ball back and Henderson swept in. Gerrard, fittingly, celebrated that one with relish, too.
