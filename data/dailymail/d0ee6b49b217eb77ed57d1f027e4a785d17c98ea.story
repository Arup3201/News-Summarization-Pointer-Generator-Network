Didier Drogba has backed Chelsea's new boys to fire Jose Mourinho's side to glory this season.

The Ivorian completed an emotional return to Stamford Bridge last week after two seasons away from the club and trained for the first time with his team-mates new and old at their Papendallaan training base in Arnhem, Holland on Tuesday.

And despite former partners-in-crime Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole no longer being around, Drogba believes summer signings Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa and Filipe Luis can herald a new era for the Blues after going through the motions with them on the latest leg of the club's pre season tour.

'It was very important for us to buy these players, they are all good signings,' Drogba told the club's official website.

'To have Cesc with us, I think he’ll understand it’s better to be with 
us than against us. They are good players and I hope they will bring 
their talent and experience to the team.

'I’ve been watching Diego play over the last few years and the first time I saw him I really liked him as a player.

'I like his character, he’s solid, he can score goals and he’s also 
technically gifted. He likes people to respect him and that’s 
important.'

The hitman also made a point of paying 
tribute to his departed former team-mates, admitting he owed a lot of 
his success in his first spell in west London to Lampard.

'This is the first time I’ve had a chance to speak about those two players that left,' Drogba said.

'Ash
 was the best left back in the world and I was lucky to have him in my 
team because when he was at Arsenal he was a difficult player to play 
against. He became a better player when he came to Chelsea.

'Everyone
 knows exactly what Frank meant to me. People say I scored a lot of 
goals but he was involved in almost all of them. The partnership with 
him was incredible and he’s a legend at this club. I know he will also 
come back one day because he belongs to the Blues.'
