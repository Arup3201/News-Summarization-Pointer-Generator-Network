A disabled man crashed his car into a wall while twice the drink drive limit then left the scene in his wheelchair.

Neil Pearce, 32, was caught by the tracks he left behind despite contacting police to tell them that his VW Golf had been stolen by a gang of youths.

His DNA was discovered on the driver's airbag and was convicted along with Sam Marshall, 19, and Andrew Watts for perverting the course of justice.

Pearce had been drinking in The Brush and Easel pub in Flanderwell, Rotherham, on the night of the collision in June last year

Prosecutor Carl Fitch told Sheffield Crown Court that the trio had been drinking in The Brush and Easel pub in Flanderwell, Rotherham, on the night of the collision in June last year.

At 2.19am police received reports a black VW had crashed into a garden wall in Northfield Lane, Wickersley.

Between 2.21am and 2.53am police received three calls from Pearce, of The Wellway, Rotherham, who said his car had been stolen.

'The car had collided with railings before colliding with a wall in the garden of a nearby house,' said Mr Fitch.

'A cushion and a driving aid were attached to the driver's seat.

Mr Fitch said Pearce was registered disabled and a wheelchair user.

All three men were arrested and Pearce failed a breath test.
