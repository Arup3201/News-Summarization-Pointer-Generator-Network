Disgraced cycling champion Lance Armstrong has been spotted for the first time since coming clean about his years of using performance-enhancing drugs in an explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey last week.

Hiding beneath a pair of sunglasses and a dark baseball cap, Armstrong was seen boarding a private plane in Hawaii with his girlfriend, 31-year-old Anna Hansen, and their two young children.

Armstrong, 41, kept his head down as he carried luggage from his car and hugged friends farewell, while Hansen looked relaxed and even flashed a smile.

Armstrong, who was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles as the revelations about his drug use emerged, was also joined by the youngest two of his five children, Maxwell, 3, and Olivia, 2.

The family is believed to have been staying in a luxury private home in the district of Kona to hide from growing speculation over Armstrong's use of doping.

'Lance did not want to be seen and was keeping a very low profile when he arrived at the airport,' one onlooker said. 'They arrived in a large SUV and he and Anna were both trying to be low key.

'She had leggings on and wore sunglasses 
while Lance also looked like an ordinary member of the public dressed 
down in jeans and a T-shirt.'

Hansen, whom Armstrong met through his 
charity work for cancer, fell pregnant with Maxwell in 2008 - even 
though it was believed Armstrong could no longer have children after 
undergoing chemotherapy for testicular cancer.

Amstrong also has three older children, Luke and twins Isabella and Grace, with his ex-wife Kristin, from whom he separated in 2003.

His
 appearance is the first since his explosive interview with Oprah 
Winfrey, in which he finally admitted to using performance-enhancing 
substances.

'I view this situation as one big lie
 that I repeated a lot of times,' he said in an televised interview with
 Winfrey screened on January 17.

He admitted that he doped in some 
form for each of his seven Tour de France victories, though he 
maintained that the last time that he 'crossed that line' was in 2005.

The distinction of before and after 
2005 is important as that was the last year that capped off his 
incredible seven-year winning streak at the Tour de France.

On top of the outright confession, he 
said that part of the reason why it carried on for as long as it did was
 because he 'didn't feel like' he was cheating.

'The definition of cheat is to gain 
an advantage on a rival or foe that they didn't have. I didn't view it 
that way. I viewed it as a level playing field,' he said.

He described the elaborate doping ring
 that he and his teammates developed was not quite as legendary as the 
investigatory commissions described it.

'It was definitely professional and 
it was definitely smart if you can call it that but it was very 
conservative, very risk averse, and very aware of what mattered,' he 
said.

'While I've lived through this process ... I know the truth the truth isn’t what is out there, the truth isn't what I said.

'I didn't invent the culture but I 
didn't try to stop the culture and that's my mistake. The sport is now 
paying the price for that, and I am sorry for that.

'This story was so perfect for so 
long- and I mean that as I try to take myself out of this situation- 
it’s this mythic, perfect story and that wasn't true, on a lot of 
levels.'

While he admitted in the interview that his seven Tour de France titles between 1999 and 2005 were drug-fuelled, he denied that he was still doping in his comeback 2009 and 2010 Tours.

But John Fahey, head of the World Anti-Doping Agency, claimed this is a lie.

Shamed: Armstrong told Oprah that he never tried to stop or change the culture of drug use in the sport

'The evidence from 
USADA is that Armstrong's blood tests show with absolute certainty that 
he was doping after 2005,' he said within hours of the interview being 
aired.

'It struck me that 
the statute of limitations under U.S. law might be relevant and 
Armstrong would not want to admit to anything in regards to his comeback
 that could be picked up under the US criminal code. This bloke is a 
cheat. Did my view change after watching the interview? No.'

In light of the confession, two men 
this week filed a lawsuit against Armstrong and his book publishers, 
charging that they were duped by the disgraced cyclist's deceptions.

Rob Stutzman and Jonathan 
Wheeler, both of California, claim that the pages of Armstrong's 
best-selling memoirs are nothing but lies after he confessed last week 
to systematic doping in a landmark interview with Queen of Talk Oprah 
Winfrey.

In the spotlight: Armstrong's ex-fiancee Sheryl Crow jets out of Los Angeles this morning, days after she revealed that she felt bad for her former flame and the people he had deceived

The class-action complaint was filed in federal court in Sacramento, California on Tuesday.

Mr Stutzman is a public relations 
executive who served as a deputy chief of staff for former California 
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Mr Wheeler is a chef and amateur 
cyclist.

They said they 
bought the books 'It's Not About the Bike' and 'Every Second Counts' 
because they believed in Armstrong and his story of returning without 
drug assistance to the Tour de France after a nearly fatal bout with 
testicular cancer.

Following
 Armstrong's doping confession, however, Stutzman and Wheeler said they 
felt 'duped,' 'cheated' and 'betrayed' by the realization that the 
books, marketed as inspirational true-life memoirs, were replete with 
fabrications.

Their lawsuit
 accuses Armstrong and his publishers, Penguin and Random House, of 
violating consumer protection laws on false advertising and fraud by 
selling the books as works of non-fiction.

Lawyers for the purported class of 
Armstrong book buyers say readers are entitled to restitution and 
possibly statutory and punitive damages for deceptions.

They
 say the publishers should have detected these, even though Armstrong 
passed drug screenings for various international cycling competitions.

A
 similar lawsuit was filed in 2011 against Greg Mortenson, co-author of 
the best seller Three Cups of Tea, accusing him of fabricating much of 
his story about promoting education for impoverished girls in Pakistan 
and Afghanistan.

That suit, which alleged fraud and unjust enrichment, was dismissed last year by a federal judge in Montana.

Penguin
 will be represented in the Armstrong suit by the firm Dorsey & 
Whitney, which won the Mortenson case for his publisher.

Dorsey partner Jonathan Herman 
declined to comment on how the publisher will respond to the Armstrong 
complaint's California-law claims but said, 'As far as we're concerned, 
this is also a case that should be dismissed.'

Also this week, an Australian bookstore made headlines after it announced it would begin moving Armstrong's books into the fiction section.

Legal battles: Armstrong has been sued by a Dallas-based SCA Promotions to recover more than $12million in bonuses and by The Sunday Times in London to recover a libel judgment that Armstrong won

'All
 non-fiction Lance Armstrong titles, including Lance Armstrong: Images 
Of A Champion, The Lance Armstrong Performance Program and Lance 
Armstrong: World's Greatest Champion, will soon be moved to the fiction 
section,' says a sign in Sydney's Manly library.

Wendy Ford, Manly Librarian Wendy Ford told the Herald Sun the sign was put up 'as a bit of a joke' by a university student who works weekends at the library.

'This person just works a few hours on the weekend and he didn't have any authority to make a statement on behalf of the library,' she said.
