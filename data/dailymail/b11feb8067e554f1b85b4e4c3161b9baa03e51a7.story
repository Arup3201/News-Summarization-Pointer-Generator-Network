The dream home of a respected architect hangs in the balance today as a judge decides whether it is too modern for its historic neighborhood and should be torn down. 

Attorneys for architect Louis Cherry and his wife Marsha Gordon, along with a council board backed by some of their neighbors, presented closing arguments to Superior Court Judge Elaine Bushfan on Tuesday.

Mr Cherry had been given approval to build their sleek two-story home in the Historic Oakwood neighborhood of Raleigh, North Carolina almost a year ago.

However six months into the project, the council revoked their permission after complaints that the design was ruining the look of the surrounding area.

Architect Louis Cherry and his wife, Marsha Gordon, stand in front of their home in the Historic Oakwood neighborhood of Raleigh, N.C. in March. A decision on whether the couple may have to demolish the unfinished home because of a neighbor's challenge that it doesn't meet guidelines for the historic district is expected shortly

The final word rests with Superior Court Judge Elaine Bushfan. It is not clear when her decision will be made but when it comes, it will be the end of months of bitter fighting in the moneyed streets. 

If the judge favors the Historic Development Commission, Mr Cherry and Ms Gordon can complete their unfinished home, according to newsobserver.com.

However if she upholds the Board of Adjustment’s later reversal of that decision, the house will be torn down.   

The couple have been unable to continue with the project, and money that could have been spent on finishing their dream home was swallowed up by legal fees. 

'It was very much our intention to design and build a house that people would really like and accept,' Mr Cherry, who had already dug the foundation and spent more than $100,000 on building materials, said earlier this year.

'It was very surprising to us that there's been this reaction, as if this is some crazy, modernist intervention.'

Mr Cherry's dream home (pictured here) is under threat after town planners in Raleigh, North Carolina said its design was too radically different from the surrounding neighborhood

Out of options: Nearly six months into construction, with the home roughly finished, Mr Cherry and wife Marsha Gordon faced the possibility that they might have to tear down their dream house

The dispute began last September, when the Raleigh Historic Development Commission issued a certificate of appropriateness, or COA, for the proposed 2,100sq ft house.

A few days later, Gail Wiesner, who lives across the street, filed a notice of intent to appeal against the house, that could be valued at as much as $500,000 when finished.

But Mr Cherry and Ms Gordon proceeded with construction, saying the city advised them the appeal was merely 'procedural'. 

Ms Wiesner, a real estate agent, argued that the commission's COA-panel violated several procedures.

She called the design 'garishly inappropriate' and said the couple had 'failed to meet their burden of producing competent, material, and substantial testimony and evidence to show that their proposed project preserves the special character of the Oakwood Historic District'.

'The structure as proposed is incongruous to the Oakwood Historic District,' Ms Wiesner, whose home was built in 2008, wrote.

'It will harm the character of the neighborhood and contribute to erosion of the neighborhood's value as an asset to its residents, to the surrounding communities, to the businesses it supports, to in-town and out-of-town visitors, and to the city as a whole.'

Oakwood is an eclectic mix of 19th and early 20th century architectural styles - from ornate Italianate mansions and mansard-roofed Victorians, to quaint bungalows and brightly-painted shotgun houses.

Houses in the area sell for about $450,000 and the historic district was created in the 1970s, when residents banded together to stop a proposed highway that would have cut through its center.

Although Mr Cherry has built a career out of modern architecture, he says his Oakwood home was sympathetic to the surrounding neighborhood, and was simple in design.

'Cherry’s house is an example of modern architecture trying hard, very hard, to be on its best manners - in essence, to be a good neighbor,' Vanity Fair reported.

September 2013: The subcommittee of the Raleigh Historic Development Commission votes 3-1 to approve Louis Cherry and Marsha Gordon's new build.

The commission, which is appointed by the Raleigh City Council is supposed to judge whether new homes meet the historical guidelines architecturally. Construction started in October 2013.

February 2014: Neighbor Gail Wiesner appeals to the Board of Adjustment and it votes 3-2 to revoke the approval for the house.

Their justification is that the commission failed in their duty to apply the proper guidelines.

The secretive board usually handles permits for day-care centers and minor city code violations.

August 2014: If Cherry and Gordon do not win their appeal - their $500,000 home will be torn down.

In February, the city's Board of Adjustment voted 3-2 to overturn the certificate of appropriateness. The panel sent word to city hall to issue a 'stop work' order. 

Word soon spread beyond Oakwood's borders. In early March, Oakwood Modern House launched its own Twitter account, which has more than 2,000 followers.

Its raison d'etre reads: 'I'm a modern house fighting for my life in a Victorian neighborhood.' 

'Nails hurt. But no love hurts worse,' one tweet read.

'Why does that ugly green house keep staring at me? Stop it,' another said, in reference to Ms Wiesner's home.

More recently messages have become even snarkier. 

'You'd think neighbors would have something better to do than complain about me, but I guess thinking doesn't always get you far in Oakwood,' one tweet read.

'In the future, every house will be famous for 15 minutes,' another reads. 

'I like big [moving] trucks and I cannot lie', it went on, along with: 'I would use this courtroom recess to take a bathroom break, but indoor plumbing is a modern infrastructure yet to be approved in Oakwood.'

Will Hillebrenner, an engineer who has been restoring his First World War-era bungalow, is one of many Oakwood residents who believe the historic development commission failed to stick to its own standards.

'The guidelines clearly state that any home, any new construction in the historic district should blend in and not stand out,' he said. 'And a home whose very intent is a living piece of art is intended to stand out.'

Many of the architect's neighbors have complained because they feel his modern home does not sit well with their period homes

Mary Iverson, who owns four historic homes in the neighborhood, says the Cherry house is beautiful, but it doesn't belong in Oakwood.

'That is a leap of 100 years of design architecture,' she said. 'So that's not an evolution. That's a, ''So let's go to another planet.'''

Gene Conti, whose 1875 Victorian was in the path of the proposed highway, likes the modern house but hates what this fight is doing to Oakwood.

'I think it's been unfortunate ... to have this kind of acrimony all across the neighborhood and have people arguing one side or the other in a very mean-spirited way,' he said.

'Oakwood is a historic neighborhood by designation. But it doesn't mean all the houses are frozen in time.'

Ms Gordon and Mr Cherry said that what is happening to them is a violation of Oakwood's spirit.

'You can't build an old home,' Louis Cherry said. 'Forty years of preservation wisdom show that building copycat homes diminishes the value of historic homes. It doesn't really honor them.'

'And it creates a Disneyland kind of community, which is not what Oakwood is,' Ms Gordon said.

The posts have become snarkier as the neighborhood gripes gathered steam over the past year ending up in a courtroom battle
