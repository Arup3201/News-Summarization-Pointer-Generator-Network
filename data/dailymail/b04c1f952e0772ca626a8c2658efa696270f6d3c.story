Swansea are increasingly confident of signing Napoli defender Federico Fernandez in time for the start of the premier league season.

Napoli have accepted their £8m offer for the Argentina defender and the player is happy with the terms all that remains to be sorted is a work permit.

Fernandez was part of Argentina's World Cup squad but has not played the quota of internationals required due to injury.

Experience: Federico Fernandez would bring quality and experience to the Swansea defence

Target: Napoli defender Fernandez played four times in Brazil for Argentina as they reached the final

Meanwhile, Napoli are threatening QPR's move for midfielder Jonathan de Guzman.

The Dutch international was on loan at swansea from Villarreal last season and QPR are willing to offer £7m. 

However, Napoli have now shown an interest and could prove more attractive than the Loftus Road club.
