Apple have opened the doors to their Chinese 'sweatshop' factories where employees are paid as little as £1.12 an hour.

Many of the staff perform monotonous tasks like wiping down screens or shaving aluminium from the edge of the Apple logo for ten tedious hours at a time.

And now the conditions inside the factory in Shenzhen - where 18 employees have killed themselves - can be seen, after ABC TV network were given exclusive access.

Monotonous tasks: Workers, paid as little as £1.12 an hour, work on the production line at Foxconn factory

Workforce: Wages have risen at the factory in recent weeks and staff were happy a probe found - although bored by the work

The broadcaster revealed that the entry-level salary of just £180 
per month is so low that it would take more than two months salary to 
pay for the cheapest iPad.

Even if the lowest earners do the maximum available overtime of 80 hours per month, they still do not earn enough to pay tax.

Previous reports have claimed that some of the workers were doing 24 hours at a time, while others were forced to stand for their entire shifts.

While the Nightline documentary knocks down those suggestions, it does show the suicide nets covering the whole site, in place to stop over-worked and stressed employees leaping to their deaths.

Managers ordered asked for the nets to 
be put up two years ago after nine workers committed suicide in the 
space of three months.

Finishing touches: An employee works on an Apple product at one factory. Pay is so low that an iPad would be more than two months wages for the lowest paid

Apple - the world's most valuable 
technology company - have faced claims that their contractors are forcing staff to do overtime involuntarily and 
employing underage workers at the factory.

It was in response to these attacks that Apple threw open their doors at the Foxconn City plant in Shenzhen, China.

Foxconn City is a unit of Taiwan’s Hon 
Hai Precision Industry Company which employs up to 1.1million people in a
 series of huge factory complexes in China.

Liang Juan, 26, told ABC News that management is 'strict'.

Wearing a white boiler-suit in the spotless factory, it is her job to flip over camera lenses with a tiny pair of tweezers.

Asked what she thinks about when performing the dull task, she said: 'I don't think much about other things because the management is strict and we're busy working and have no time to think about other things.'

Queue: Chinese people line-up for jobs at the factory. Most of the employees are aged between 16 and their mid 20s

Despite the boring jobs unemployed young Chinese workers queue up for work - and employees say that working conditions are much better than at other factories.

An estimated 3,000 people were queuing at the gates to find work on one day when ABC News were there.

Workers are charged around £11 per month to share a dormitory with seven other people and pay around 50 pence for a rice dish in the cafeteria.

Apple have also allowed independent examiners from the Washington-based Fair Labour Association in to carry out inspections.

Hard at work: Staff typically do long shifts for low pay at the factory in China

July 2009: A Foxconn employee fell from apartment building after losing iPhone prototype. 18 more workers try to commit suicide over next two years.

2010: 137 workers at Suzhou facility, owned by Apple suppliers Wintek, injured by poisonous chemical, n-hexane, used to clean iPhone screens because it dried faster.

May 2011: Four workers dead and 18  injured in dust explosion at Foxconn factory in Chengdu, which produces iPad parts.

December 2011: 61 workers injured in gas explosion at Riteng Computer Accessory Co factory in Shanghai, which was trialling aluminium iPad 2 back panels.

The Foxconn City complex of factories, run by Foxconn Technology Group, employ 235,000 workers and Microsoft, Dell and Hewlett Packard projects are also built on the site.

In 2009, a Foxconn employee fell or jumped from an apartment building after losing an iPhone prototype.

Over the next two years, at least 18 other Foxconn workers were linked to attempted suicides.

Despite claims to the contrary, the abuses appear to have continued.

With demand for the firm's products 
soaring the factory is forced to churn out products in growing numbers. 
Last year they sold 93million iPhones, 40million iPads, 38million iPods 
and 17million computers.

The ABC journalists given unrestricted access to the site and freedom to talk to anyone found that staff were paid above the minimum wage - and no-one worked there below the age of 16.

Apple said 60,000 workers have been sent on college courses for free and they have informed one million staff of their legal rights.

Insight: It was the first time that Apple had allowed camera crews inside their factory

Chief-executive Tim Cook said that they were working hard to improve conditions for workers.

'No one in our industry is doing more' to improve the live of employees,' he said, PC Mag reported.

He added: 'We are constantly auditing facilities, going deep into the supply chain, looking for problems, finding problems, and fixing problems, and we report everything because we believe that transparency is so very important in this area.'

However, concerns about the factory remain - and ABC News suggested that managers were warned in advance of their visit.

Last month, 150 Foxconn employees 
threatened to leap from a three-story building after claiming of poor 
pay and pressurised working conditions.
