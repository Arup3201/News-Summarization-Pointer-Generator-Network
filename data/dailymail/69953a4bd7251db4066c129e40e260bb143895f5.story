These incredible pictures show an unlucky man who got too close to a testerone-fuelled stag and was forced to take refuge up a tree.

The farcial scene took place at Bushy Park in West London and was captured on mobile phone by passer-by Lisa Acremom.

The man was trapped after he wandered too close to two stags facing each other down, prompting one to break off from his showdown and chase him.

Oh deer!: The man keeps the fenced-off tree between himself and the stag, which is currently full of testosterone for mating season.

Stand-off: The black-clad pedestrian had to circle the tree as the aggressive stag jockeyed for position

It is currently mating season for the magnificent red deer, when the stags and bucks compete for females.

At this time, the large males roar, bark and clash antlers in a spectacular way in an attempt to fight off rivals and attract as many females as possible.

The footage shows the panicked man deperately trying to keep a fenced-off tree between him and the enraged, powerful beast's antlers.

The pair jockey for position in a tense game of cat-and-mouse before the man calls out: 'I need some help here!' 

I give up: The stag at one point appears to get frustrated with the battle of wits and walks away...

...only to suddenly resume its offensive against the beleaguered man

At one point the stag, one of around 125 red deer that live in the park, appears to lose interest and trot away, only to suddenly wheel about and launch itself at his quarry, who once again moves into cover.

Lisa, speaking to The Guardian, said: 'There were two stags parallel going to have a fight and all of a sudden a man has got too close and was chased by a stag, who was hopped up for rutting season.

'He was just walking along the path and stopped as he thought the stag was going to cross and it took its choice and went after the bloke instead of the other stag.'

Desperate: The man is forced to take desperate measures as the stag is unwilling to let him get away

Can't follow me: The man climbs into the tree using the barrier, which wobbled alarmingly as he made his way to safety

Eventually the bearded man clambers up the rickety fence and into the tree to escape his bellowing tormentor.

'Nobody could get close to the bloke to help so when he went up the tree I dialled 101 and phoned the police,' Lisa added.

With his prey out of sight, the deer moves on and police assisted the man out of his hiding place.

Chiefs at The Royal Parks, the organisation which manages Bushy Park, are urging walkers, especially those with dogs, to take care during mating season, which takes place between September and October, as deer are wild animals and can behave unpredictably.

Safety at last: The beast accepts defeat and walks away. Police later ensured the man was OK

Bill Swan, Bushy Park Assistant Manager, said: 'We are aware that this morning police assisted a man down from a tree where he had taken refuge after feeling threatened by a deer.

'During the deer mating season the male deer will be protecting their territory from rivals whilst rounding up  groups of female deer.

'The deer will be far more active than usual, running and behaving spontaneously and defensively.  It is safest to keep as distant as possible from them within the park during this time.  They are very strong and fast wild animals following powerful instincts.

'The Royal Parks have new signs on every gate and around the car parks warning of this and has used local media to remind visitors to the park that at all times and particularly during the deer mating season, it is important to be alert to your surroundings and maintain a minimum distance of 50m from deer. Never get in between the deer, never feed the deer and never photograph them at close range.'

Deer have roamed freely in The Royal Parks since 1529. There are two million deer throughout Britain, more than at any time since the Norman Conquest, despite an annual cull of up to 350,000 animals.
