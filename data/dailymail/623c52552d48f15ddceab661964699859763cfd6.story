Novak Djokovic and Petra Kvitova swapped their tennis gear for formal wear on Sunday night when they attended the traditional Wimbledon Champions' Dinner.

The 27-year-old Serb, fresh from his five-set victory over Roger Federer in the men's singles final, was joined by coach Boris Becker and wore a black suit as he arrived at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden.

Kvitova was also in attendance following her 6-3, 6-0 victory over Canadian Eugenie Bouchard on Saturday afternoon at the All England Club.

Both Djokovic and Kvitova won their second Wimbledon titles having first tasted glory on the lawns of SW19 three years ago in 2011.

Djokovic admitted doubting himself before securing his second Wimbledon title and the seventh grand slam of his career.

The 
Serbian denied Federer a record eighth Wimbledon crown, but conceded he 
feared the match might slip away after failing to convert a match point 
in the fourth set.

'Congratulations to Roger, he proved what a great champion he is once again here this year,' said Djokovic.

'I respect
 your career and everything you've done Roger - thank you for letting me
 win today! After dropping a fourth set it wasn't easy to regroup. I 
tried to compose myself and find the necessary energy to win the fifth. I
 don't know how I managed to do it.

'This is the tournament I always dreamed of winning. This is the best tournament in the world, the most valuable one.'

After 
thanking his family and his camp, Djokovic added: 'Last but not least, I
 would like to dedicate this title to my first coach who taught me all 
the basics of tennis shots and behaviour and everything I know about 
tennis - Jelena Gencic - and she passed away last year, and this is for 
her.'

Djokovic knelt to the turf to eat some of the famous All England Club grass to greet his victory - just as in 2011.

'The last time I won here was part of a fantastic year, and it's just amazing for it to happen again,' he said.
