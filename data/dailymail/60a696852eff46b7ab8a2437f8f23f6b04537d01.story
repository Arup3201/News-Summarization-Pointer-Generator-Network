More cycles of IVF were undertaken in the UK last year than ever before - but there has been no rise in the success rate, figures released today show. 

They reveal more than two-thirds of women undergoing treatment are aged 37 and under, while the average age for treatment remains static at 35. 

Women over 40 represent the minority of all patients treated, with women aged over 45 accounting for just two per cent of treatment.

The report, from the UK's fertility watchdog, also shows that the majority of these older women are using donor eggs rather than their own when trying to conceive. 

Nearly 50,000 women underwent a total of 64,600 cycles of IVF in the UK last year, new figures show 

In 2013, 49,636 women had a total of 64,600 cycles of IVF, more than ever before.

And a further 2,379 women had a total of 4,611 cycles of donor insemination - also up from the previous year.

However the overall success rate has remained constant at around 25 per cent, according to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).

The new figures also reflect changes in society.

The number of IVF treatment cycles involving same-sex female couples has increased by nearly 20 per cent year-on-year, rising from 766 treatments in 2011 to 902 in 2012. 

Meanwhile, donor insemination cycles involving same-sex couples rose by nearly 15 per cent, from 1,271 in 2011 to 1,458 in 2012. 

However these amount to a minority of all treatments undertaken, the HFEA said. 

The report also shows that the number of IVF treatment cycles using both donor eggs and donor sperm has doubled over the last five years, while the use of frozen embryos is now involved in more than 20 per cent of all treatments.  

Elsewhere, the campaign to reduce multiple births is shown to have had good impact, with numbers declining.

Having a multiple birth (twins, triplets or more) is the single greatest health risk associated with fertility treatment, so guidelines now state only a single embryo can be transferred at a time.

Multiple births carry risks to both the health of the mother and to the health of the unborn babies, with twins or triplets more likely to be premature and to have a below-normal birth weight.

The report shows that multiple births occurred in 16.9 per cent of treatment cycles in 2012, down from 18.8 per cent in 2011. 

Sally Cheshire, Chair of the HFEA, said: 'This report offers unrivalled insight into one of the world's most advanced IVF sectors, helping to inform the decisions of patients and clinicians alike.

'We are very pleased to see that outcomes in most categories are improving each year, and are particularly heartened by the continuing downward trend in multiple births, something we've worked hard with professionals to achieve.

'But as well as providing data, over time these reports offer us a unique insight into the changing nature of social norms, whether that is same-sex parenting or older mums. 

'In that sense they have become a fascinating resource not just for patients and clinicians, but for everyone.' 

Today's report also revealed the campaign to reduce multiple births is having a good impact, with the numbers declining. Multiple births carry risks to both the health of the mother and to the health of the unborn babies, with twins or triplets more likely to be premature and to have a below-normal birth weight

Commenting on the figures, Professor Sheena Lewis, Chair of the British Andrology Society, and Professor of Reproductive Medicine, Queen's University Belfast (QUB), said: 'It is very disappointing that success rates have not improved, yet again. 

'In my opinion, one of the reasons for the low success rate is an unsatisfactory diagnosis of the male partner. 

'We should test the man's sperm at a molecular level, looking at his sperm DNA quality to help guide couples to the best treatment for them.'

Dr Allan Pacey, a fertility expert from the University of Sheffield, added: 'The data shows that treatments such as IVF are now very much in the mainstream of UK medical practice.

'IVF is now performed more frequently than other well-know procedures such as having tonsils removed (there were 47,141 of those in the NHS in 2012-13). 

'Therefore, it remains disappointing that in many parts of the NHS Assisted Conception is still a Cinderella Service with the NICE funding guidance being ignored and many patients having to pay for their own treatment.'

However he said the report also shows the continued coordinated efforts of professionals to reduce the number of multiple births.

'While twins and triplets may seem like an instant family, health outcomes for children are better if they are born 'one at a time',' he explained.
