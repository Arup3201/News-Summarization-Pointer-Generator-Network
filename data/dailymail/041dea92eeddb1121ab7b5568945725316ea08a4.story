Nearly half - 44 per cent - of UK children aged 8-12 years-old use Facebook, according to a survey. In the U.S., the figure is 39 per cent.

Across both countries, 23 per cent of eight-year-old children access Facebook - most lured by games on the social network.

Facebook bars children under the age of 13 from using the site, but it remains highly popular with children, some of whom access it through internet-enabled smartphones.

Facebook: The vast majority of children NOT on the social network said they stayed away because they¿re not allowed to sign up, not because they¿re not interested

Ten per cent access the site first via a parents account.

Even children as young as six are aware of the 
social network - 66 per cent of six-year-olds say they have heard 
of Facebook.

By the age of 12 -a year under Facebook’s minimum age of 13 - 58 per cent
of children in America and the UK have their own account.

The vast majority of children NOT on the social network said they stayed away because they’re not allowed to sign-up, 
not because they’re not interested.

Ian Douthwaite, CEO of Dubit, which conducted the reserach said: 'There is a current danger on Facebook that if children
lie about their age and don’t register a correct date of birth that 
they will be getting served advertising that is not appropriate for 
their age.'

Fifty three per cent of children - in both the U.S. and the UK - said they would be interested in a social network which allowed children.

'Our research shows that games are one of the main reasons for children joining social networks -36 per cent of 6-14 year-olds have played games on Facebook in the last month. It emphasises the importance games play in attracting children to social networks.'
