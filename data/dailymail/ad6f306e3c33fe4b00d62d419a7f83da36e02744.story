The cost of equipping a child for school has more than doubled since the 1980s, new research has revealed.

Including books, uniform, stationary and gadgets such as iPads and mobile phones, the average schoolchild will boast a haul worth £550.80 when they return to school in September.

By contrast, the parents of children starting school in the 1980s paid £252.40 while those in the 1960s paid the equivalent of £231.20 in modern money.

Expensive: Equipping a child for school now costs more than £550 after uniforms and gadgets are included

1. Pencil case with pens and pencils - £4.50

2. Three exercise books - £1.80

3. Drink - 90p

4. Two text books - £39.00

5. Calculator - £8.70

6. Smartphone - £362.10

7. Plastic shatterproof ruler - 80p

8. Two snacks - £2.50

9. Lunch box - £4.20

10. Headphones - £5.80 

Modern parents spend an average of £19.70 on satchels, £362.10 on smartphones and £40.80 on school books, with another £7.60 on food and drink and £14 on stationary.

Headphones, which are carried by most children, are worth £5.80 per pair on average. School uniforms increase the bill by a whopping £100.80.

The research, carried out by department store John Lewis, also found that almost half of all secondary school children now take a smartphone to school.The new phones cost on average 362.10 pounds, the study of 2,000 parents found. A tech-savvy five per cent even carry a tablet or laptop in their school bag, while two per cent have an eReader.

More than a third take their headphones to school, while one in five can’t handle a day without music and take an MP3 player.

Unsurprisingly, cash-strapped parents are questioning why gadgets are necessary. Mother of three Maria Dawson, 42, from Southampton said: 'Two of my 
children have smartphones and that means they are taking hundreds of 
pounds worth of equipment to school.

Change: Half of all schoolchildren now own smartphones, but 1980s children had to make do with pencils

'All of their friends had them and, 
children being children, that meant they were constantly asking for them
so they would be up to date.

'In all honesty, I’m not sure why 
children aged 12 and 13 need to take a phone worth hundreds of pounds to
school - I do worry about them getting lost or stolen.'

But it’s not all doom and gloom for parents as they add up the costs of sending their children to school.

The cost of books, lunchboxes and stationary has actually fallen. Three exercise books in the 1980s would have cost parents £2.40, while today they cost 60p less at £1.80.

Lunchboxes are now £1.40 cheaper, costing £4.20, while a calculator now costs £8.70, compared to £11.60 in the 1980s.

A John Lewis spokesman said: 'The good old fashioned exercise book and pencils have made it into the top three must-have school bag items for the last 50 years.

'But there’s no shying away from the fact that technology is making its way into the school bag and classroom.

'Technology is evolving at such a rate that we predict in another 10 years’ time the top 10 school bag list will be unrecognisable as today’s digital natives grow up and become parents themselves.

'In the run up to back-to-school we’re predicting we’ll sell a computing device every two minutes during the two weeks over Bank Holiday.'
