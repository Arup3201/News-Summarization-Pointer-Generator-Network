The daughter of one of America's most notorious serial killers is attacking Stephen King for using her father as the inspiration for his new film.

Kerri Rawson, the daughter of Wichita, Kansas, BTK (Bind, Torture, Kill) serial killer Dennis Rader, has said King is 'exploiting' the people her father killed, and her own family ,with his new film, A Good Marriage.

The movie, which is set to hit theaters October 3, is about a woman who is unaware her husband is a serial killer.

It is based on a short story the author wrote in 2010, which he then adapted for the screen.

Coming soon: The film is set to hit theaters next Friday, and Rawson is hoping that King will donate the money he makes to 'abused children, battered wives, or police'

While promoting the film, King has said on programs like The View that he was inspired by the BTK killer when he came up with the idea for the story, about a man whose own family was unaware of the horrible atrocities he had committed. 

Rawson, 36, and her family were also unaware her father was a killer. 

'He’s exploiting my father’s 10 victims and their families,' Rawson told the The Kansas City Star. 

She then said of her father, 'He is not worth all the books and the news stories and all the attention.'

Rader was arrested in 2005 and charged with 10 murders which occurred between 1974 and 1991. He received the nickname the BTK killer for the way in which he would bind and torture his victims before eventually killing them.

He was caught after he sent a floppy disc to police, which they were able to trace back to him.

He is currently serving 10 consecutive life sentences.

'He’s just going to give my father a big head, and he absolutely does not need that,' Rawson added.

'Great – now Stephen King is giving my father a big head. Thanks for that. That’s the last thing my dad should get.'

She does think there is one way however King could do the right thing after the film, which stars Joan Allen and Anthony LaPaglia, opens next week.

'Any money King makes off this story should go either to abused children, battered wives, or police.'

In the meantime, she said she is never reading one of King's novels again.
