A bizarre sighting near JFK Airport has led to a federal investigation after a pilot spotted an unidentified flying object as he landed a commercial jet Monday.

The Alitalia pilot was in his final approach into JFK over Brooklyn, New York, just after 1pm when he saw something hovering about 200 feet away.

Despite the aircraft's sudden appearance in the sky, it was not in the pilot's way, and he was able to land the commercial jet safely.

Trouble in the skies? An investigation is underway after an Alitalia pilot spotted what he said was a small drone as he prepared to land at John F. Kennedy International Airport, pictured

Sources told the New York Post that the 'drone' was black in color, and had helicopter rotors on its corners.

In an audio recording released last night, the pilot can be heard saying: 'We saw a drone, a drone aircraft.'

In response, the tower warns other pilots, telling one: 'Delta 1368, use caution. There was a report of a drone aircraft on about a 5-mile funnel 1,500 feet.'

Authorities are now seeking the public's help to find whoever was controlling the aircraft.

Special
 Agent in Charge John Giacalone said in a statement: 'The FBI is asking 
anyone with information about the unmanned aircraft or the operator to 
contact us.

'Our paramount concern is the safety of aircraft passengers and crew.'

Anyone with information is urged to call the FBI at 212-384-1000. Callers may remain anonymous.

The
 FAA said that all flights landed without incident, and the agency is 
currently investigating. The Post reported that the Joint Terrorism Task
 Force is also taking a look into the sighting.

In a statement to CNN
 yesterday, FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said: 'The FAA is investigating a
 report... He saw a small, unmanned or remote-controlled aircraft while 
on final approach to Runway 31 Right.'

While other flights in the area were cautioned about the drone sighting, no other pilots witnessed the unexplained aircraft.

Investigators are looking into the fact that the 'drone' may have been radio-controlled model aircraft that wandered into commercial airspace.

Under FAA safe operating rules, model aircraft are prohibited from flying higher than 400 feet above ground and no closer to an airport than 3 miles, unless airport authorities have been notified.

There are two model aircraft fields in Brooklyn - both within 17 miles of the airport - according to the New York City Parks Department.

Regulated: Radio-controlled model aircraft drones are not allowed within three miles of an airport without its operator first notifying air traffic controllers
