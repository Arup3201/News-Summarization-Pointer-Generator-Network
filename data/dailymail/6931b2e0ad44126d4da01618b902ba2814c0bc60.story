Aaron Ramsey has hit out at the horror pitch in Andorra that has left him fighting for fitness ahead of Arsenal’s key clash with Manchester City on Saturday. 

The midfielder will undergo medical tests at Arsenal on Wednesday afternoon after sustaining an ankle injury playing for Wales against Andorra on Tuesday.

The Gunners star will return to the club's London Colney HQ  following the international break and will immediately undergo a scan  to determine the extent of the injury.

Ramsey is touch and go to make a return for Arsenal's showdown with Manchester City on Saturday, but the club do not fear it is a serious injury.

The midfielder suffered the injury to his right ankle after falling awkwardly on the artificial 3G surface following a late challenge and faces an anxious wait on the results of medical tests.

Ramsey struggled for Wales during their 2-1 victory at the Estadi Nacional that was sealed by Gareth Bale’s brace but revealed the difficulties with playing on plastic and said he cannot wait to return to grass.

He flew back to the UK with Chris Coleman’s squad on Wednesday afternoon and now has two days to recover for the visit of champions City to the Emirates.

‘The pitch was very hard, there was no give in it,’ said Ramsey. ‘I rolled my ankle late on. I could feel it.

‘I hope I'll be available for Saturday. Manchester City at home, those are the games you want to play.’

The new pitch was only certified by UEFA last week after initial tests showed the ball rolled too quickly but the extra black rubber pellets laid down produced awkward bounces and made movement tricky.

‘I just don't know how you're meant to play football on that pitch to be honest,’ Ramsey added. ‘It was very frustrating, you couldn't play the ball quickly. It was very difficult.

‘Due to the pitch we couldn't get into our stride. Normally we play quick, keep it on the floor, play around teams. We just couldn't do that, we had to take the extra touch, it was bobbling.

‘I hope that's the last time I play on a plastic pitch. It was a great free-kick to win it for us, we're delighted with the points, now we move on and hopefully play on some grass next time.’

When fit Ramsey’s passing ability should exploit the speed that new £16million striker Danny Welbeck will bring to the Arsenal team. ‘He showed for England what a good player he is with those two goals,’ said Ramsey.

‘He's a player who is very good technically, can get in behind teams and score goals. Hopefully he'll do well for us.

‘He brings runs in behind, pace, and power and his finishing will benefit us for the rest of the season.’
