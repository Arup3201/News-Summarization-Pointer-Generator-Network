Maybe the guest filming this should have just got out, but a dramatic video was taken of a hotel ceiling collapsing during serious flash flooding.

Erik Slemon and his dad Allan Goldberg, of Miami, Florida, were staying at Embassy Suites in Charlotte, North Carolina, when the incident happened.

A drainage pipe, which takes water from the roof and runs through the lobby’s ceiling, burst causing the space to flood with water.

Erik Slemon and Allan Goldberg, of Miami, Florida, were staying at Embassy Suites in North Carolina, when they watched the hotel begin to flood...

But the most dramatic part was when a large chunk of the roof collapsed and fell to the ground while the lights and television remained on.

‘In a matter of seconds it got a little stronger,’ Mr Slemon told WCNC.

‘I pulled out my phone and I shot it and the whole ceiling just came down. The whole lobby was flooded in a matter of five seconds.’

Firemen were called after heavy rains caused the pipe to burst as flash flooding caused havoc across the area, reported WCNC.

People were in McMullen Creek, swollen because of the rains, and while one person climbed out, one died and another is missing, authorities said.

The emergency services also rescued stranded motorists and evacuated a few neighbourhoods as heavy rain flooded the city’s roads.

Rescuers helped more than a dozen motorists stranded in cars because of high water, a fire service spokesman said.

They also evacuated people from two neighbourhoods when creeks spilled over their banks.

The flash flooding was trigged by heavy showers and thunderstorms, and as much as six inches of rain fell in a few hours in some areas.

‘We still getting reports from around the
city. We had a lot of people trapped 
and we've been busy all afternoon'

Fire service spokesman

Firemen said many of the rescues were necessary because motorists drove through high water on city streets instead of turning around.

The fire department used boats to rescue some of the people trapped in their homes.

‘We still getting reports from around the city,’ a fire service spokesman said. ‘We had a lot of people trapped and we've been busy all afternoon.'

Heavy rain also seeped through roofs in other neighbourhoods and flooded the inside of homes and businesses.
