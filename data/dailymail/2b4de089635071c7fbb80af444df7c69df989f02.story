A Texas mom had to cut short a day trip after security guards at the George W Bush Presidential Library told her she could only nurse her five-week-old baby in a public bathroom.

Vanessa Baily had been visiting the Dallas library with her family last weekend, who were visiting Texas for the christening of her son, Desmond.

When the newborn started to get hungry, Ms Baily asked for directions to a room where she could feed him, and was directed to the women's restroom.

Shocked: Vanessa Baily, with her five-week-old son Desmond, had to leave the GW Bush library after being told to nurse her baby in a public restroom

'We had exhausted all of the pumped milk
 available and formula that we had brought,' Ms Bailey told Fox 4.

'I found that 
guard and asked her where it would be acceptable to nurse my son, and 
she directed me to the bathroom stall…that's what they said was the 
policy.'

Refusing to feed her baby in a public bathroom, Ms Baily and her family ended their tour early and left for home.

Ms Baily said that her trip had been problematic from the start, when security noticed all the bottles of expressed milk she was carrying when she arrived at the library. 

Describing her baby as a 'constant 
eater', Ms Baily said that she traveled prepared for the likelihood that
 she would need to nurse and bottle feed Desmond a lot to keep him 
content.

Campaign: Vanessa tweeted about her experience and hopes that it will help raise awareness about nursing mothers' needs and rights

After spotting the bottles, security staff at the front desk told Ms Baily that although she would be able to bottle feed in the lobby, if she needed to nurse her son she would have to ask for access to a private room.

A female security guard was pointed out to the family as being the best person to contact if needed, Ms Baily told WFAA.

When Desmond needed to be nursed however, the guard directed Ms Baily to the women's restroom.

'She did say I could use the handicap stall, but any mom knows that a bathroom is not a place for young babies to be eating.' Ms Baily said. 'It's not hygienic or legally what the law requires.'

She said 
that although the library had apologized, other mothers have since come forward to say
 they had a similar experience.

Ms
 Baily is hoping her experience, and the reaction to it on social media 
sites, will encourage more people to realize breastfeeding is natural, 
and that mothers should not be forced to feed babies in toilets.

Apology: The Bush Presidential Library has contacted the Baily family and reminded staff that nursing mothers should not be directed to the bathrooms

'It’s time to normalize it. Women who nurse are not exhibitionists,' Ms Baily, who uses a nursing shawl for privacy while feeding her son in public, said.

Since the mother-of-two had to abandon her trip, the library director has contacted her to apologize. She is still waiting to hear if the $100 admission fee they paid will be refunded.

A statement issued by the library said: 'This action by the security guard was inconsistent with the official policy at the George W. Bush Library and Museum which supports federal law defining a mother's rights to feed her child in any location she is allowed to be as guest.'

Staff and security guards at the museum have been reminded of the breastfeeding policy there.

'The George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum supports the mother's right to breastfeed in any location they are allowed to be as guest,' a spokesman said.
