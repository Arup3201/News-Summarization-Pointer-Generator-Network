A medical examiner who failed to inform police that the carbon monoxide gas that killed an elderly couple in their hotel bed could strike again, has resigned.

Dr. Brent Hall, Watauga County Medical Examiner in North Carolina, had a medical report on his desk that explained the reasons for Daryl and Shirley Jenkins deaths, however their toxicology reports did not make it to Boone police until after an 11-year-old boy died in the exact same room two months later.

Jeffrey Williams was found dead last week at the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza hotel. His mother was also found seriously ill.

Resigned: Dr. Brent Hall, Watauga County Medical Examiner in North Carolina left his post suddenly on Friday. He has not spoken about the case or when he received the toxicology resutls

Poisoned by Carbon Monoxide: Jeffrey Williams, 11, was found dead in room 225 of the Best Western Hotel because of a faulty pool water heater

Just two months earlier, an elderly couple died in room 225, but it appears the state toxicology reports were never put at the top of a priority list.

'I don't know why they didn't expedite them, but the thinking at the time was that it was not carbon monoxide,' said Chief Police Officer Dana Crawford.

Daryl and Shirley Jenkins died on April 16 and although the state completed its toxicology report proving carbon monoxide killed her on June 1st, the delay ended up becoming deadly.

Police officers did not receive the results from the report for another ten days, but by then another person had died in the same room – 11-year-old Jeffrey Williams.

Deadly delay: Boone police were not given the result from toxicology tests that revealed carbon monoxide was to blame for ten days. It meant guests were still staying in the room and Jeffrey Williams,11, lost his life as a result

Toxicology tests have confirmed that the deaths of Daryl Dean Jenkins, 73, and Shirley Mae Jenkins, 72, were both due to carbon monoxide poisoning

When Jeffrey and his mother checked into the hotel, they did not know about the previous victims — nor did the police.

The state said Medical Examiner Dr. Brent Hall had received the toxicology report the week before Jeffrey Williams died, but Hall failed to share those results with Watauga County authorities who could have shut down the motel.

Dr. Hall suddenly resigned on Friday, but he has not answered questions about when he received the results.

Three people have died in the last couple of months after staying in room 225 at the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza in Boone, North Carolina

'I can’t speculate as to why we 
didn’t get them,' Police Chief Dana Crawford said, according to WSOC. 
Ms. Crawford said those documents could have saved Williams’ life.

'I would like to think we would have 
been able to conclude and find the source of that carbon monoxide, and 
with that information, been able to rectify that whole situation before 
this happened,'

Ms. Crawford said if her department knew 
there was a carbon monoxide death in the room, they would have worked 
with fire officials to find the leak.

He said it took investigators just hours to trace it back to a pool water heater after Williams’ death.

On Saturday, the state released a 
statement, 'These deaths were a tragedy that should have never happened.
The Department of Health and Human Services is continuing to gather the
facts.'

The 11-year-old boy who died was laid to rest today.
