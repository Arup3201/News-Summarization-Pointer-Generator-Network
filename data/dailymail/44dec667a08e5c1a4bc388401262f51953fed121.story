New advert for organic Botox cream has been met with criticism

Shows a leather-clad 52-year-old smashing up pensioner's belongings

TV presenter and make-up artist Sue Moxley has swapped light-hearted beauty shows for a role as a femme fatale in a gangster-style promotional clip ... and she's coming under fire from the grey rinse brigade.

The blonde beauty guru is the star of director Nick Moran's new advert for organic Botox cream which pokes fun at the elderly and has been blasted on social networking sites for its inappropriate references to old age.

The video, which promotes Botox alternative cream Natox, shows Sue - who has made a career out of staying glamourous while women the same age as her let it all go - smashing a pair of pensioner's reading glasses with her heeled boots.

She then fires a gun at false teeth 
before throwing a mobility scooter from a building and setting fire to a
 shopping trolley and bus pass.

Destruction:  A leather-clad Sue Moxley can be seen setting fire to old age pensioner's belongings in a controversial new advert for a face cream

Message: The advert ends with this powerful message which has received a lot of complaints

After setting fire to various pensioner's objects, Sue walks away as the phrase: 'Up yours to old age' flashes on the screen before a pack shot of the Natox cream is shown.

Sue certainly looks the part in her thigh-high black leather boots, gold leather jacket and bright red lipstick, but the wife of Dollar singer David Van Day has been criticised for her role, despite being 52-years-old herself and admitting to using the cream as well as Botox in the past.

One posted on YouTube: 'It’s no 
laughing matter, FACT! How is this fun or a laugh? If you have to push 
your terminally-ill mother round in a wheelchair, you might understand! 
Ads like this should be banned, FACT!'

However,
 one Twitter user rushed to support the presenter saying: 'Look how 
utterly amazing @Suemoxley looks in her new advert for Natox!It might be
 controversial, but she looks gorgeous!'

Defending herself Sue told MailOnline: 'I look good for my age, I have looked after myself and now I don't even use Botox as I use the cream instead.

Hell for leather: Sue is glamorously decked out in leather but has been met with much criticism

'I love having a frown free face. Why should I worry about what people think of my age so no more fibbing about it!

'There has been quite a lot of people
 getting angry about the advert but no harm was meant; I mean come on, 
I'll have my real bus pass soon!'

On Natox's website, the £89.99 product is described as an alternative to Botox. It says: 'This natural Botox alternative still works in much the same way as traditional Botox. However, its application does not require the use of needles to inject a toxic component into the body.

'It gives the effect of Botox by stimulating the muscles and nerves to clear the effect of lines and wrinkles and prevent them from re-appearing.

'It contains microscopic electromagnetically charged particles to stimulate and relax nerves and muscles.

'There is less chance of encountering problems when using the product as it is produced with completely natural ingredients.'

Speaking about the product Sue said: 'I immediately saw a difference in the deep horizontal lines in my forehead, my skin is so tight and vibrant,

'I just can’t get enough of this stuff!'
