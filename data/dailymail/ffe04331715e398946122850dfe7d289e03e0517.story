She was made redundant from the Nine Network in December due to cost-cutting measures.

And now Emma Freedman, 25, has opened up about how the heartbreaking ordeal left her in a flood of tears and bed-ridden for a few days afterwards. 

Speaking in an interview with News.com.au, she explained: 'I just cried all day. I didn’t get out of bed for a few days. It’s pretty gut wrenching … I put a lot of myself into that job and maybe that’s a lesson learned to not be so personally invested in something.'

However, it wasn't just Emma who had been left angry following the axe as her famous father, horse-racing champ Lee Freedman, took to his Twitter account at the time to vent his frustration over his daughter's sudden boot from the small screen.

The blonde beauty wasn't aware her dad had made such a public outburst until afterwards.

But she believes he did it because he was disgusted with the way she'd been treated by the firm, despite her many years of commitment to the network.

She explained: 'He’s proud of what I’ve achieved … and was upset that someone who’s given so much and has been such a loyal company person could have that happen to them for a reason that couldn’t really be defined.'

Taking to the social networking site at the time, Lee, 58, let his protective instincts as a father shine through, as he tweeted to his followers: 'Congratulations to CH 9 for firing Emma Freedman in a cost cutting measure. Wonder what they’ll do to the ones with no talent? #shot (sic).'

Emma joined the Nine Network many years ago as a contributor to provide the coverage of the Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival due to her family history in the horse racing industry.

In 2010, she became a weather girl for Weekend Today and proved she could endure the unpredictable climatic conditions as she did live crosses  in the snow, scorching temperatures and torrential downpour.

She was also a regular sports presenter on Wide World of Sports and Weekend Today.

Meanwhile, the Australian star hasn't let her recent redundancy dampen her spirits as she's bounced back with a new project. 

Last month, it was announced the presenter would be swapping morning television for a fun-filled job hitting the radio airwaves as she joins Jules Lund on the Today Network's Scoopla program.

The bubbly babe kick-started her new job, which sees her reporting on hot celebrity gossip every weekday in the 6pm time slot nationally, on February 2.
