Luxury African holiday: JP Morgan banker Martin-Artajo in Zimbabwe, where he and his wife spent an extended holiday while FBI investigators were searching for him

Raising a glass of champagne on a luxurious African holiday, this is the London-based banker wanted by the US over a £4billion trading scandal.

Javier Martin-Artajo Rueda, 49, had apparently gone ‘missing’ while the FBI sought to question him over alleged offences by his team at banking giant JP Morgan.

But while investigators sought to bring him to justice earlier this year, he and British wife Sara Berrow, 50, were apparently enjoying the high life on an extended holiday in dictator Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe.

Last night, however, the authorities finally caught up with the £8million-a-year high-flier in his native Madrid.

He was arrested after turning himself in at a police station and a Spanish judge will now rule on  extradition to the US, where he could face up to 25 years in jail.

Major City figure Martin-Artajo is being named as the key suspect in the ‘London Whale’ trading scandal which severely damaged JP Morgan and was the latest in a series of blows to the banking industry when it emerged last year.

Shares in the American lender and British banks fell after it was revealed that JP Morgan trader Bruno Iksil, nicknamed ‘the London Whale’ because of his huge spending power, had made a series of bad bets on the international markets.

The Frenchman has been granted immunity from prosecution in return for assisting investigators, who this month announced that  his boss Martin-Artajo was instead suspected of covering up the mammoth loss-making deals over an extended period.

The huge trading losses caused a storm in Washington, prompting a Senate investigation.

But when the FBI began seeking Martin-Artajo, he was not to be found either at his £2.5million country mansion in Church Westcote near David Cameron’s home in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, or at his house in Chelsea, London.

Photographs have now emerged showing the 
banker and his wife in March at the five star Bumi Hills safari hotel 
beside Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe.

Break: The photos of Martin-Artajo's extended holiday were taken in March 2013, around the time the warrant for his arrest was issued in the U.S.

Enjoying himself with boating trips and posing happily for pictures, he appeared to show little concern about the case being mounted against him in America.

Along with trader Julien Grout, a Frenchman also based in London,  he faces four charges of conspiracy, wire fraud and making false filings to US regulators.

Miss Berrow – who married the banker in Chelsea 12 years ago and has a nine-year-old son by him – refused to comment last night.
