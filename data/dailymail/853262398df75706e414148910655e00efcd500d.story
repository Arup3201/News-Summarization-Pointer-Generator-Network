A 63-year-old man in Houston, Texas is on trial for allegedly luring several teenage girls to his home in Friendswood where he paid them hundreds of dollars to perform sexual favors.

Michael Wayne McIntosh - known to his victims as 'Money Mike' - faces three charges of sexual assault of a child, and could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. 

In opening arguments on Tuesday, McIntosh's defense attorney Charles Thompson took a bold stand in telling the jury that the eight victims are not to be trusted.  

'At the end of the day you are not going to find any of these women credible,' Thompson said on the first day of the trial.

Ring leader: Michael Wayne McIntosh - known as 'Money Mike' to his victims - appears in court on Tuesday as he stands trial for three counts of sexual assault of a child

Den of prostitution: Prosecutors say the 63-year-old man lured high school girls to his home in Friendswood, Texas where he paid them hundreds of dollars to perform sexual favors. Above, the address connected to McIntosh according to public records

He explained that one of the girls, initially arrested for allegedly helping arrange the dates between her friends and McIntosh, is only testifying because the prosecution agreed to drop the charges against her. 

'They have cut a deal where she doesn't get into trouble in order win this case,' he said. 

The prosecution admits that they did agree not to pursue the charges, but that they made no binding agreement.

And two of the other victims are currently in the midst of civil lawsuits against McIntosh, with their families seeking $2.5million for emotional damage. 

'They thought there was going to be a payday for this, like prostitutes do,' Thompson told jurors.

That harsh portrayal was not echoed on the stand when one of the girls testified yesterday. 

A girl identified as 'Stephanie' said she was 15 at the time when she first met McIntosh in the summer of 2013 through a friend at Ojos Locos Restaurant, and her eyes welled with tears as she was asked to point out in court the grey-haired man in a dark blue suit.  

Meeting place: One of the girls who took the stand on Tuesday says she met McIntosh through a friend at this restaurant in southeast Houston. She says she later performed oral sex on him in exchange for $300 for books

She said after meeting at the restaurant, she and her four friends reconvened with McIntosh at a gas station where he fueled up their car. 

They then went over to his house for about an hour, during which he gave all four girls $100. 

Following a known method by pedophiles, McIntosh did not try to initiate sexual contact with the girls that night. 

It was only later, when she texted him asking for $300 dollars for books, that he asked her to do him a favor in return. 

Stephanie says her boyfriend drover her over to McIntosh's house, and waited outside while she went in to meet the old man. 

He took her into a bedroom and asked her to perform oral sex. She says she remained fully clothed during the brief encounter and quickly made an excuse to leave with her money when it was over. 

McIntosh allegedly started the ring after becoming close with a 16-year-old girl he met at a local restaurant. 

Heavy charges: McIntosh faces 20 years in prison if convicted. Pictured above entering court on Tuesday 

After befriending her by leaving several large tips of $100 or more, he invited her over to his house, and convinced her to bring her 'easily manipulated' friends. She recruited these girls, between the ages of 14 and 17, from Clear Springs High School and Clear Creek High School. 

When the meetings turned sexual, McIntosh would pay the girls thousands of dollars, and the girl allegedly took her cut of the cash. 

When a prosecutor asked one of the victims how she spent her money, she said she used it on food, purses, jeans and a tanning membership. 

One of the questions that has been charging through this case is how the girls were able to spend so much time at McIntosh's house without raising an alarm with their parents. 

Some of the victims said they simply lied about where they were. Other aspects of the ring were much harder to conceal.

'There was a time I fell asleep and my mom went through my purse and found a thousand dollars and questioned me about it. I told her I was holding the money for my friend,' said one witness.
