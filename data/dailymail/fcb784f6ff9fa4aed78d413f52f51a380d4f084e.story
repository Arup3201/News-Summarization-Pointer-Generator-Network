A police officer who was told she could have appendicitis was shocked to discover her stomach pains were actually due to a tumour the size of a rugby ball.

Emma Brown had gone into her local GP surgery suffering from a cough and pain in her lower right abdomen.

Doctors suspected appendicitis and the 40-year-old was immediately sent to hospital for tests.

But she was shocked when scans came back to reveal the huge growth on her right ovary, measuring 173.6mm by 160.3mm – roughly the same size and shape as a rugby ball.

Emma Brown had originally gone in to her local GP with a stomach complaint only to be told it could be appendicitis but she was sent to hospital where scans revealed the massive rugby-balled size growth

Response officer Emma, from Marlborough, Wiltshire, admitted she had felt scared when she heard the cancer diagnosis.

'Initially they didn't show us the pictures so it didn't really make sense. I had lived with it,' she said.

'It was only when I saw the scan pictures that I was taken aback. Seeing this mass really shocked me.

'I was scared but I decided to face it with a smile and as much courage as I could muster.'

Doctors later told the response officer for Wiltshire Police that the growth was cancerous

The hospital scans showed the giant tumor, which had grown to 173.6mm by 160.3mm on her right ovary - roughly the same size as a rugby ball

She added: 'Watching programmes you think, 'how would you react to that?

'I was obviously surprised that there was this mass in my stomach and that I didn't know about it.

'To begin with, I was very matter of fact about it all. Then within a couple of hours that changed. I saw it as a journey. This was going to be my journey.'

Miss Brown, who joined Wiltshire Police 20 years ago as a special constable, underwent surgery to remove the tumour and ovary after the discovery last December. She also had a course of six chemotherapy treatments and has finally been given the all clear.

 'Once you are given the all clear, the journey doesn't stop. Life never becomes normal again. You will always be someone who has had cancer,' she added.

'I was blessed with fantastic family and friends. I have never been on my own. I have been carried through it. I know there are others who are less fortunate than me.

'My colleagues have been absolutely fantastic. I couldn't have asked for a better team. I can't put into words how brilliant they are.

'The hardest thing has probably been being off work and also having to explain to my family. I love what I do and being away from work has been really hard.'

Throughout her difficult journey, Miss Brown  fundraised for others affected by cancer. 

Although she didn't lose her hair through her treatment, she decided to shave her hair in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support.

'I was going to be having time off so I though what better opportunity would I have to do something good,' added the police officer who raised a total of £6,500.
