The only free ticket promised by Bob Arum for the richest fight of all time is for female UFC star Ronda Rousey, who he heard was preparing to spend all her career fight winnings thus far on a seat as close to ringside as that amount could buy.

As Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao prepare to touch gloves in the biggest fight of the century on May 2, the UFC women's bantamweight champion will be counting her lucky stars that Arum chose her to be the recipient of the golden ticket.

Boxing promoter Arum expressed that he was a huge fan of Rousey's and wanted to show his support by offering her such a prized asset for the Las Vegas bout.

Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao will battle it out in the most eagerly anticipated fight of a generation

Pacquiao is putting his WBO championship title on the line for his fight with Mayweather on May 2 

Rousey has continued to take the ultimate fighting world by storm and headlined UFC184 on Saturday when she took on the unbeaten Cat Zingano in Los Angeles.

The 28-year-old retained her bantamweight title, beating Zingano after a record-breaking 14 seconds with an armbar submission and continuing her unbeaten record to 11-0. 

'We were expecting that she might come out and do something flying at me right away,' Rousey said. 'That's not usually how you land an armbar at that angle, but it works. It was a lot like judo transitions, where you scramble the second you hit the ground.'
