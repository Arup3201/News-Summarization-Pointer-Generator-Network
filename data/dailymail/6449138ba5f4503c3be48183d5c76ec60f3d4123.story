She's more at home wearing neon high-vis jackets and steel capped wellies than ball gowns and heels, but that hasn't stopped Katie Stamps being crowned Miss Birmingham.

And now after scooping the top beauty gong the 5ft 9in model who works in construction is now heading to the Miss England finals.

Katie, 21, from Kidderminster in Worcester, beat off 19 other rivals to take the crown, sending her through to the finals next month.

She decided to enter herself in the pageant to bring a bit of glamour into her life after spending most of her days in temporary cabins on building sites.

She said: 'I’m always in hard hats and high-vis jackets. I really love construction and I want more girls to get into it.

'It’s a shame it’s seen as such a man’s world -- I find it very rewarding.

Katie beat 19 rivals to the title in her first ever beauty contest - and said
her colleagues had backed her to the hilt

'I stumbled across the application [For Miss Brimingham] online and thought it looked fun, and decided it would be a good confidence boost to swap my hard hat for high heels.

'I never expected to win. My other half is away a lot so I thought it would be good to do something for me.

'Obviously it was so different from what I am used to. Being in the construction industry isn’t very ladylike and not very glamorous.

So was she expecting to win? 'When my name was called I was so shocked I couldn’t move,' she admits.

'The other contestants had to push me back out to the stage. I couldn’t believe it.

'People had suggested I tried modelling because of my height but I never pursued it as I’m happy with my current job.

'The men at work have been great and were very supportive of me winning. They think it’s quite funny.

'I would be happy to take it all the way though, I have been automatically entered into Miss England in June so I will see what happens with that.'

Katie was crowned Miss Birmingham following a glitzy competition at the city’s Crescent Theatre.

The process involved fund-raising for her nominated charity Variety Children’s Club, and an interview where contestants had to say how they would use the role of Miss Birmingham.

The girls paraded on stage in four outfits: an eco-dress they had made themselves, sportswear, an evening gown and a party dress.

Katie was supported on the night by her mum, Alex, 41, and step-dad, Steve Hall, 41, who were in the audience with two friends.

Sadly, her boyfriend, Longbridge-based engineer Peter Gibbs, missed her big night because of childcare arrangements.

Since she was 17-years-old, Katie has been an office manager for construction company Stepnell.

From building site to beauty pageant: Katie wanted the chance to show her glamorous side

The beauty queen, who lives with boyfriend Peter, 33, added: ‘In my job I don’t have much opportunity to look very glamorous but I love being able to get my hair done - it makes a nice change from being on the building site.'

Miss England competition director Angie Beasley said: 'It's fantastic news that we're getting girls of this calibre through into the competition.

'I know when I was doing the competitions myself it was all about becoming a model.

'The fact the competition is attracting girls from all different backgrounds is great because is raises the competition and shows that girls want to so much more these days.'
