Women can now instantly find out where to get a gorgeous outfit they've spotted, thanks to a new app. 

The so-called Inspo tool can identify designer jewellery, handbags and clothing by matching a photograph with a huge database of items.

It scans the clothing a user has just seen on somebody else, and pairs it with the exact or closest matches. 

Inspo scans the clothing, and presents a link to an online store where it can be bought

The free app then presents a link to the online store(s) where the user can get connected to purchase it if they wish. 

The company behind the project currently has a database of around 10,000,000 products and links to over 600 online shops.

Inventor of the app Yvonne Tesch, 34, from Berlin, who has a team of 20 staff constantly updating and developing it, said it was being given away as a free app for mobile phones and tablets.

She said: 'We get paid every time a user clicks on a product and the online stores give us between 10 percent and 30 percent of each sale.'

It also works not just for real-life people spotted walking down the street, but also for photographs seen in magazines or even paintings.

You could find modern fashion items that are close matches to garments from decades ago - or even centuries.

So far, the service is only available for women - but it's still early days.
