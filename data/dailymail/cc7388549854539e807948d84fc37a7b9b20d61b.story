More than 7,000 firefighters were yesterday battling a California wildfire larger in size than Las Vegas, as the state faces one of its worst years for the blazes in recent memory.

The King Fire east of Sacramento remains only 35 per cent contained after burning about 140 square miles and destroying a dozen homes, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

Expected high winds up to 35 mph that could stoke the flames and send embers flying ahead of the blaze failed to materialize yesterday but could still come today.
