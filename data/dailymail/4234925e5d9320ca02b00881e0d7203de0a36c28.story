A novice bell-ringer caused become caught in her rope – and had to be winched 20ft to safety from the belfry.

Helen Springthorpe, 58, was beginning her weekly practice session at her church when she was lifted by the rope and fell, knocking herself unconscious.

Her horrified fellow bell-ringers called an ambulance, but because the bell tower could only be reached by a steep and narrow spiral staircase, paramedics could not carry her down on a stretcher.

A team of firefighters helped to rescue Helen Springthorpe from the top of the spiral staircase

The solution? A team of specialist 
firemen more used to rescuing climbers from cliff tops and rock faces – 
who embarked on an elaborate mission that involved opening a trap-door 
in the belfry floor and winching Mrs Springthorpe to the ground 20ft 
below.

Mrs Springthorpe, who works as a 
typist, said: ‘I don’t remember very much at all, I started pulling the 
bells and the next thing I knew I was looking at a paramedic.

‘I have no real memory of it at all.  I
have no memory of being caught up. I think I hit my head on the wall 
and then fell over and hit it on  the floor – it wasn’t that exciting. 
The exciting bit was being rescued by all the firemen.

‘It’s just been quite a drama I think 
trying to get me out – the actual accident wasn’t much, but trying  to 
get me out of where I was was quite difficult.’

Paramedics who arrived at St 
Nicholas’s Church in Bathampton, near Bath, initially thought Mrs 
Springthorpe had broken her hip and gave her morphine – but she received
a clean bill of health after a hospital examination.

Rescue: A total of 19 firefighters - including specialists more typically called out to rescue rock climbers in difficulty - attended the scene at the church in Bathampton

A trapdoor in the gallery floor was lifted out so firefighters could lower the 58-year-old through the gap to safety

Precarious: The bell-ringer was strapped to a stretcher and passed from the confined gallery at the top of the belfry to a waiting firefighter on a ladder

Mrs Springthorpe, from Bath,  has only
been bell-ringing for three months and took up the hobby after a 
neighbour suggested she come along to the weekly group sessions.

‘I just like the church bells, I’ve 
always liked hearing them, so I thought I’d have a go,’ she said, adding
she would ‘have to see’ whether she would be going back to the belfry 
any time soon.

Tower captain Peter Powell, 79, was one of five bell-ringers who were there when Mrs Springthorpe fell.

'I started pulling the bells and the next thing I knew I was looking up at a paramedic'

He said: ‘It all happened  so quickly.
She was unconscious for a while, and two  of our ringers, who are 
qualified medically, quickly got down with her and tried to revive her 
quickly and start talking to her.

‘At the same time the ambulance was 
called and then it was a case of keeping her warm on the floor, because 
she was very cold and the colour had drained from her face. Everybody 
was just sitting around very worried, not quite knowing what to do, but 
left the two that did know what they were doing to carry on.

‘She was learning to ring,  had just started, and then  this happened.’

Reverend Paul Burden said Mr Powell 
had been training bell-ringers for many years and that nothing like the 
incident on Monday evening had ever happened before.

Careful: Ms Springthorpe's stretcher was attached to specially designed ropes before being guided to the ground by firefighters, who spent over an hour getting the woman to safety

He said: ‘It’s not nice when it 
happens and it’s a reminder that bell-ringing is a very skilled hobby 
and there needs to be careful training on it.’

The clergyman added that he was pleased with how the rescue went and praised the emergency services for doing a ‘brilliant’ job.

He said: ‘Helen was only really aware of the number  of people involved when she got to the bottom and was wheeled out.’

The nine firemen from Bath who 
initially attended called in a specialist team of 11 from Bristol, who 
usually deal with rescues from rock faces.

Ms Springthorpe had been attending bell-ringing sessions for three months at the picturesque church

The typist joked that she may think twice about returning to bell-ringing after her experience

An Avon Fire and Rescue Service 
spokesman said: ‘The local woman took off with the rope and she got 
knocked around in the process.

‘There is a small trap  door and the 
only way she could have come down was through the trap door – the 
staircase was so narrow we wouldn’t have managed to bring her down 
through that on a stretcher.

‘The woman was safely lowered about 
20ft to the ground, where she was taken into the care of ambulance staff
who took her to hospital.’
