Sacked: Former Greenwich tourism chief Neil McCollum joked about crime in the borough

A tourism boss who slated an area he was paid £60,000 a year to promote has been sacked after a three month probe into his comments.

Neil McCollum was head of tourism for the London borough of Greenwich and responsible for the area's Olympic welcome strategy when he branded a nearby district 'unsafe' in a Twitter rant earlier this year.

His internet comments caused an outcry and despite having them removed from his account a blogger spread them sparking outrage.

Mr McCollum tweeted: 'Guest appearance in Woolwich today.  Wonder if it has changed. 'Mental note: Make sure wallet is not visible!'

The area is understood to have issues with low-level crime and has undergone several redevelopments.

Residents in the South East London borough quickly complained about Mr McCollum's jibe and the message was removed from his Twitter account.

After a three-month investigation, Greenwich Council chiefs have now dismissed Mr McCollum from his post.

Incriminating: Mr McCollum's facetious Twitter message, which backfired

Mr McCollum, who lives in Whitstable, Kent, had also been in charge of Greenwich's Olympic welcome strategy. Greenwich is hosting equestrian and shooting events next year.

Several residents backed the council's decision with messages posted on the internet.

One wrote: 'Regardless of the truth that Woolwich has a crime problem, his job was to paint the whole borough in the best possible light and in that he failed.'

But others criticised the council. One message said: 'He's an idiot for posting every thought that pops into his head on Twitter but what he said is correct.' 

Another added: 'This shows how we allow political correctness to take priority over honesty and common sense.'

Greenwich council confirmed a tourism officer had been dismissed.

Redevelopment: Woolwich has suffered with low-level crime in the past but it is being modernised

A council spokesman said he had lost his job for 'breaching our code of conduct and bringing the authority into disrepute.'

The spokesman added: 'The reason for this dismissal is that the individual brought the council into disrepute and breached the council’s rules of conduct.

'The individual has the right to appeal against this decision.'

Mr McCollum was previously tourism manager for Canterbury City Council.
