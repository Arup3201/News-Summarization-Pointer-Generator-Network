A two-year-old girl lost both of her feet and part of her hand after her father accidentally ran over her in a ride-on lawnmower and then dragged her the length of their driveway.

The girl, named Ireland Nugent, has undergone two surgeries and is due to have two more, but her parents have spoken out saying that this accident will not stop her going forward.

'She will continue to succeed. She will do great things in her life,' her mother Nicole told reporters at a press conference.

'This will not stop Ireland.'

Victim: Ireland Nugent, 2, lost both of her feet and part of an arm in the Wednesday accident

United front: After initially being treated for hysteria following the accident, Nicole and Jeremiah Nugent stood by each other during a press conference on Thursday

Police said the father, identified by police as 47-year-old Jeremiah Nugent, was going to park the mower into the garage at the family's Palm Harbor, Florida home at around 7 p.m. on Wednesday.

Accident: Jeremiah Nugent, 47, was pulling into his garage to park the ride-on lawnmower when he reversed after seeing his wife wave to tell him he was going to run over something

He is said to have not noticed that his daughter had tripped behind the machine, and he only realized that something may be wrong when he saw his wife was alerting him that he was about to drive over something.

The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office says the man responded by putting the mower in reverse, running over his daughter.

According to police, the father dragged the little girl down the driveway of their subdivision and onto the street before he realized what had happened.

Once he did, Mr Nugent immediately turned off the mower, and the woman called 911.

Authorities say the child's feet were severed above the ankles. Her left hand was injured but intact.

She was airlifted to Tampa General Hospital with her distraught parents where she is undergoing treatment.

'She suffered from immediate amputations to both legs below the knees and partial amputation on her hand,' Palm Harbor Fire Rescue said in a media release.Â 

Too late: Police said her father swaddled her with a blanket and immediately called 911

Horrific: A two-year-old girl lost both of her legs and part of her hand last night after her father accidentally ran over her in a ride-on lawnmower, pictured, and then dragged her the length of their drive way

Support: The family's pastor stood with them as they spoke to reporters outside of the Tampa hospital, telling how their neighbors have created a fund to pay for Ireland's prosthetic limbs

Police told ABC News that it will not be possible for the girl's limbs to be reattached, but her mother told a group of reporters on Thursday that their neighbors have banded together and begun raising funds so that the Nugents will be able to pay for prosthetic limbs for Ireland.

'Never in my life did I think this would happen to my child,' Mrs Nugent said according to NBC News.

She was taken to Tampa General Hospital, and her condition was unavailable Thursday.

The girl's parents were treated at the hospital for hysteria immediately after the incident, but showed a positive, united front alongside their family pastor during the press conference on Thursday.
