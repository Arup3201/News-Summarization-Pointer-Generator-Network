New Yorkers are set for a rare astronomical phenomenon tonight as an asteroid blacks out a star in the night sky.

163 Erigone,  a 45-mile (73-kilometer)-wide asteroid in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter will eclipse the brightest star in the Constellation Leo.

This so-called occultation will last no more than 14 seconds, around 2 a.m. EDT (0600 GMT).

Where to look: Looking southwest (90° to the right of the Moon) around 2 a.m. EDT on the morning of March 20th. Regulus will appear roughly as high as the Moon. It's the brightest star in the area.

Around 2 a.m. or a bit before, go out and face the Moon.

Extend your arms straight out to your sides.

Regulus will be straight above your right hand, roughly as high as the Moon is.

It's the brightest star in that area.

What makes this unusual is the brightness of Regulus and the potential viewing audience of around 20 million people.

Weather permitting, the eclipse should be visible with the naked eye from New York City and elsewhere along a populated swath in the U.S. Northeast and eastern Canada.

The star will vanish from sight for up to 14 seconds around 2:06 a.m. EDT on the morning of the 20th for New Yorkers, and a minute or two later farther north.

'Regulus shines right through moonlight and light pollution that's in the sky — even the light pollution over a city like New York," says Alan MacRobert, a senior editor at Sky & Telescope magazine.

'Just be sure to shield your eyes against any glary lights, and Regulus should be easy to find.

'Think of it as a space-rock eclipse of a star.'

Where it will be visible: The predicted occultation path. The blue lines show the outer edges of the zone where Regulus will be blacked out if the prediction is perfect.

Astronomers use the term occultation for these events, from the Latin word for 'hid'.

'I've been using a telescope to go after asteroid occultations of really faint stars for ages. I never thought we'd get one in my life for a star this bright and easy.'

This is the first time in history that an occultation of such a bright star by an asteroid has been predicted to cross such a heavily populated area.

Regulus will vanish behind the asteroid 163 Erigone for several seconds on the morning of March 20, 2014, for well-placed skywatchers.

Asteroid occultation timers — an elite specialty crowd among amateur astronomers — hope to enlist thousands of everyday folks in a citizen-science project to document this event more thoroughly than any asteroid occultation has been before.

You can participate with just your eyes, or with a DSLR camera in movie mode, or with better gear if you're into serious astronomy stuff.

This effort is being spearheaded by the International Occultation Timing Association (IOTA). Its website for the public telling all about the event and how to participate is occultations.org/Regulus2014.

Two past successes. The double asteroid Antiope and big, roundish Interamnia blotted out faint background stars on July 19, 2011, and March 23, 2003, respectively.

The goal is to see whether the star disappears as seen from your location, and for how long — especially if you can time the event to high precision.

From this data, astronomers hope to obtain a very precise profile of Erigone's size and shape, something that cannot be done any other way short of sending a spacecraft there.

This has been done for many asteroids in the past that have occulted fainter stars.
