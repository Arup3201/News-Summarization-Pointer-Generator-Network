Appearances: 3 (plus 2 off the bench)

Goals: 1 (against Everton in Premier League) 

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is already concerned that loan signing Radamel Falcao may not be physically capable of sustained action in the Barclays Premier League.

United signed the Colombia striker on loan from Monaco at the start of the season and already have the details of a permanent deal in place if he has a good spell at Old Trafford.

However, Falcao arrived having suffered a serious knee injury last season and has only started three league games.

The 28-year-old is nursing a thigh problem he picked up in training ahead of the game against Chelsea last month.

He has scored once this season and Van Gaal and his coaching staff know they will have to see a vast improvement on that return if Falcao is to justify his big wages between now and the summer.

United cannot afford to commit to a long-term contract that would cost them more than £1million a month in wages on a player who will be 29 in February unless they are sure he is up to it.

They are keen to recruit a world-class goalscorer in the summer, but will not have the budget to sign Falcao full-time and then pay big money for another centre forward.
