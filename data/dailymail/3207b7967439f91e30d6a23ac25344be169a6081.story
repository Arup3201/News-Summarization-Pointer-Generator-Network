An overweight British man won a landmark discrimination case against his employers, after a High Court judge ruled the effects of obesity can be classed as a disability.

John Walker, 49, weighed more than 21 stone when he was dismissed from his post as an IT manager at Sita Information Networking Computing UK. 

He was sacked after spending seven years off work with health problems linked to his size such as asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic fatigue and knee problems.

Mr Walker, from Bude in Cornwall, initially lost the case when it was ruled that he could not be categorised as disabled but that decision was overturned on appeal. 

It is understood that Mr Walker, who now weighs 19 stone, has since secured a six-figure settlement from a health insurance company.

His case echoes the ruling by the European Courts of Justice last week that although obesity itself was not deemed to be a disability protected under EU laws, it could be disabling in its effects.

It means that companies could now be obliged to provide bigger desks and special parking spaces to accommodate larger staff members.  

Karsten Kaltoft, a 25st Danish childminder, claimed he was fired because his weight affected his performance

The ECJ case was brought by Karsten Kaltoft, a 25st Danish childminder, who claimed he was fired because his weight affected his performance. 

The development was described as ‘regrettable’ by Tam Fry, a spokesman for the National Obesity Forum. 

He said: ‘Employers should be hugely concerned about this. They will face problems if employees insist that they are disabled, and need special furniture or wider access to fire exits, for example. 

‘But the biggest cost will be the amount of money they will have to spend in contesting cases made against them. Lawyers will be licking their lips over this ruling.’

He added that lack of clarity around what constitutes obesity would prove problematic.

‘In my opinion the [European] court was gravely in error not to put a definition on what they consider to be disabling obesity,’ he said.

‘They did not confirm the original ruling from July which indicated having a body mass index of 40 would be the cut-off point. Now, without that definition, every person over the World Health Organisation’s threshold of a BMI of 30 will feel that they can make a claim.’

He said in practice overweight people would face more discrimination and feel further singled out by sitting in ‘the office “fat-chair”’ or by being allocated a more desirable parking space ahead of their colleagues.

In Britain, 64 per cent of adults are overweight or obese, costing the NHS £5 billion a year.
