Paris Saint-Germain have held initial discussions over a possible move for Dinamo Kiev winger Andriy Yarmolenko.

The Ukraine flyer tormented Everton in their Europa League tie last month and has been watched by Liverpool in recent seasons.

PSG are weighing up options with Manchester United refusing to budge on Angel di Maria. Yarmolenko is represented by Mino Raiola who also looks after Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Romelu Lukaku, Mario Balotelli and another PSG target Paul Pogba of Juventus.

The 25-year-old was a target for West Ham and Stoke last summer with Kiev willing to sell for around £15million.

Yarmolenko has been in superb form for his club this season, scoring five goals in just 10 games. 

In November, he scored a hat-trick for Ukraine in a Euro 2016 qualifying match against Luxembourg.  

Yarmolenko lets fly with a stunning strike to give Dynamo Kiev the lead against Everton earlier this season
