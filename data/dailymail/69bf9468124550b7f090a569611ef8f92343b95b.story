She shocked audiences worldwide with her astonishing four-letter outburst this week - and now even her father has joking condemned Kim Sears' tirade, calling it 'disgraceful behaviour'.

Nigel Sears, a coach and pundit, was asked about his daughter's expletive-filled howl as she watched tennis playing fiancée Andy Murray overcome Thomas Berdych in a heated Australian Open semi-final on Thursday.

The 57-year-old joked 'she's always had a potty mouth - gets it from her mother of course' before expressing his surprise that Miss Sears' 'feisty' support had created such a furore.

Expletives: Kim Sears appeared to unleash a foul-mouthed tirade while watching tennis playing fiancée Andy Murray overcome Thomas Berdych in a heated Australian Open semi-final on Thursday

Joked: Kim's father Nigel Sears said his daughter must have learnt her bad language from her mother

Speaking to EuroSport, he said: 'Quite amazing how much has been made of this - but it's pretty emotional in that box when you're close to someone... and it was a feisty match.

'They've been together a long time, and it just goes with the territory. Andy's a huge figure in the game, so naturally her association with him means there's always going to be a certain spotlight on Kim.

'I think by and large she deals with it extremely well.I think people are reading a lot into this.' 

Miss Sears sent Twitter into meltdown after the usually poised 27-year-old appeared to hurl a string of expletives towards Czech player Tomas Berdych in one of several heated moments during the clash.

As tensions boiled over, the devoted supporter was caught on camera appearing to mouth 'F*****g have that, you Czech flash f***', or 'Take that, you flash f**k'.

The clip, which was recorded after the camera zoomed in on Ms Sears, sparked an online frenzy, with hundreds both amused and shocked by the outburst from Murray's usually-demure other half.

The tennis star quickly jumped to the defence of his fiancée and said the seemingly uncharacteristic episode was down to 'a lot of tension' whipped up before the match.

He told reporters: 'When there's a lot of tension surrounding something which you (the media) created, which you created, then it's completely normal.

'The whole first set, everyone was tight. My physical trainer, physio, I'm sure for Dani it was uncomfortable.

'Even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the court, there was tension there for him, as well. Yeah, in the heat of the moment you can say stuff that you regret. And, yeah, that's it.'

The dramatic outburst came as Murray won a tense baseline rally in the first set to claim a break back against world number 7.

Luckily, there were no microphones nearby to pick up her exact choice of colourful words - but it was evident Ms Sears was deeply invested in the match.

The highly-charged fixture was the first time Murray and Berdych had come head-to-head since the latter hired Murray's former trainer Dani Vallverdu. 

Mr Vallverdu helped Murray win his two grand slam titles and an Olympic gold before they stopped working together in November.

The dynamic dominated the pre-match build-up, despite both players trying to quietly play down tensions between the two camps.

But there was no doubt that it added a fiery edge to the match, with Murray admitting afterwards that there had been acrimonious mood around Melbourne Park.

Murray eventually beat the Czech in four sets, earning himself a spot in the coveted final this weekend. 

Speaking on court, he said: 'A lot was made of Dani working with him. We've been friends since we were 15 and I felt like that was a bit unfair and unnecessary.

'This is sport, there is more to life and I thought it was unfair and created a bit of extra tension.

'It was there definitely at the beginning but I think everyone calmed down after the start of the match.'

But the Scot also used his victory to heap praise on his coach, Amelie Mauresmo.

He said: 'A lot of people criticised me for working with her and I think so far this week we have showed women can be very good coaches as well. 

'Madison Keys, who reached the semi-finals here, is also coached by a woman in Lindsay Davenport and I see no reason why that can't keep moving forward so I am very thankful to Amelie for doing it.

'I would say it was a brave choice from her and hopefully I can repay her in a few days.'  

Meanwhile, on the sidelines, Ms Sears was facing a tennis WAG-off against Berdych's tanned model partner Ester Satorova for the second day running.

Much has been made of the rivalry between the two women, both of whom have recently got engaged to their tennis pros.

Murray and Berdych both proposed to their respective girlfriends  recently before presenting them with expensive diamond rings. 

The British No 1 proposed to Sears, his girlfriend of nine years last year with a 3.5 carat platinum diamond ring, which he is said to have selected himself.

Murray's engagement ring to Sears has been valued at around £250,000 while Berdych's love token is estimated to be worth around £225,000 

U.S television coverage further built up the so-called 'battle of the bling', with ESPN displaying another split screen of Sears and Satorova, with added captions at the bottom showing the estimated worth of their rings. 

A 50-50 split screen was shown of Sears and Berdych's fiancee Ester Satorova, after which Ms Sears appeared to mouth: 'Oh for f**k sake.'

Back on court, after coming out on top in a long exchange in the first set, Murray turned in the direction of Vallverdu, who sitting in his opponent's box, and let out a wild roar in celebration.

Berdych was clearly incensed, giving the Scot a long stare as both players walked back to their courtside chair. 

Then, as Murray sat down, he pumped his fist towards his own box, to which Sears responded with a fist pump of her own. 

Moments later, Berdych complained to umpire Pascal Maria about the quality of the tennis balls, to which Murray responded: 'He always does this.'

As Murray let out some expletives in annoyance at his own play, the big screens in Rod Laver Arena further added to the drama.
