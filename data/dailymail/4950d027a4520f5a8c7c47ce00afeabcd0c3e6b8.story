A German television drama about the Second World War has sparked outrage in Poland for allegedly trying to spread responsibility for the Holocaust.

'Our Mothers, Our Fathers', which follows the lives of five wartime Germans, shows members of Poland's resistance army shunning Jewish members and failing to help others heading for Auschwitz.

In one scene, a partisan boasts 'we drown Jews like rats'.

Controversial: Drama 'Our Mothers, Our Fathers' follows the lives of five wartime Germans

Criticism: The Polish ambassador to Berlin has slammed the depiction of Poles as hostile towards Jews in the programme

Changing history? The Polish ambassador said he was 'shocked' by the portrayal of his country's resistance army

Yesterday Poland's ambassador to 
Berlin, Jerzy Marganski, slammed the series in a letter sent to German 
public television station ZDF, which broadcast the 14 million-euro 
production.

'The image of Poland and the Polish 
resistance against the German occupiers as conveyed by this series is 
perceived by most Poles as extremely unjust and offensive,' Marganski 
wrote. 'I, too, am shocked.'

Among other criticisms, Marganski said
 viewers learn nothing of the Warsaw uprising, in which up to 200,000 
Polish civilians died, nor of the many Poles who helped Jews.

He said the programme gave the impression that more people 'were to blame for the destruction of Jews' than just the Germans.

Taduesz Filipkowski, spokesman for
 the International Home Army Association, a veterans' organisation, also
 criticised the German production.

'We are angry with this film's 
message,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'We believe it to be evil slander and an attempt to 
justify Nazi crimes by setting them against the alleged anti-Semitism 
that existed in Poland before the war. Our government should not ignore 
this attack on our reputation.'

Producer 
Nico Hofmann said the depictions of 'the Polish situation.... are based
 on historically vetted material' and there was no intention to defame 
the Poles.

Despite the criticism, 'Our Mothers, Our Fathers' has proved to be a hit in Germany with as many as seven million viewers tuning into the show.

Hofmann said one of his goals was to 
encourage a national debate among the generations 'to speak for the 
first time about the experience' of the war. He said the third and final
 episode drew a 20.5 percent market share among viewers aged 14-59 
years, which he described as 'extremely high' for ZDF.

Many critics have praised the series 
as a milestone in Germany's troubled reckoning with its past and an 
overdue examination of individual guilt in the war.

But the mixed reactions to the series 
underscore how, nearly 70 years after the Second World War, the conflict remains
 a source of bitterness in Europe, even for people born after the 
fighting ended.

Since the series aired, newspapers and
 online forums have been filled with comments by descendants of the war 
generation, with many saying their parents rarely, if ever, spoke of 
their experiences.

'I can imagine that in many families 
where there are survivors there will be conversations,' said Jens 
Wehner, a historian at the German Military Museum in Dresden.

'Soon nobody will be left who experienced
 (the war),' warned Frank Schirrmacher, publisher of the conservative 
daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. He praised the series 'for the 
earnestness, the love of detail and the unwillingness to compromise,' 
which allowed it to have 'what it takes to touch the soul of the 
country.'
