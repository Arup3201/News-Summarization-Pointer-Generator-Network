Knockout: John Applewhite, 34, was punched in Long Island by a man in a random attack, breaking his jaw

A Long Island resident has been arrested for attacking a volunteer utility worker from Florida who had travelled to New York to help restore power after Hurricane Sandy left the region largely without power.

Thomas Libretto, 34, was arrested outside of his Long Island home four days after allegedly beating up John Applewhite, also 34.

Applewhite had travelled to East Hempstead, Long Island from his home in Lakeland, Florida with 24 other electrical workers, and had just finished a 16-hour shift when a man yelled at him from across a parking lot.

Mr Applewhite said that the suspect got out of his black BMW, walked toward him, and punched him once in the face, breaking his jaw and fracturing several other bones in his face.

The electrical worker said that he had just finished a gruelling shift helping out the Long Island Power Authority and was heading to dinner at the Texas Roadhouse when a man in a BMW across the parking lot began yelling at him.

According to the Nassau County Police Department, the man parked his car and walked toward Mr Applewhite and fellow lineman John Barefoot.

Thinking the man had a question about power restoration, Mr Applewhite headed in the direction of the man, while Mr Barefoot stayed by the service vehicle.

‘Just as I got within arm’s reach, he decked me,’ Mr Applewhite told WTSP. The single punch broke his jaw, his cheekbone, and other facial bones. He also suffered a black eye.

When Mr Barefoot tried to intervene, the suspect allegedly bit him on the finger and then ran back to his BMW, driving away.

Mr Applewhite was rushed to Nassau Medical Center, but he was eventually flown back to Tampa.

The lineman said that his jaw has to be wired shut, and he faces reconstructive surgery to repair the broken bones in his face.

Despite the brutality of the attack, Mr Applewhite said that he still holds a good impression of the town, according to ABC Action News.

‘It was one heck of a punch,’ he told the station. ‘If nothing else, I would like to shake the guy’s hand. He got a heck of a jab.’

Mr Applewhite’s sister, Mary Anne, told WTSP that she is saddened by the attack. ‘John is such a sweet person and he certainly didn’t deserve this,’ she said, noting the difficulty her brother will face during the upcoming holidays.

But his father, Morris Applewhite, had a more practical solution. ‘If he has his jaw wired shut, we will just feed him through a straw, and he’ll enjoy it,’ he said.

In the dark: More than 70,000 customers of Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) were without electricity Monday, two weeks after Superstorm Sandy struck

Flooding: Sandy flooded many low-lying areas of Nassau County in Long Island, causing billions in damage

ABC 7 reports today that Libretto was arrested outside his Levittown, Long Island home and has been charged with third-degree assault. He is scheduled to appear at his arraignment on November 27.

Parts of Long Island were hard-hit by last month’s Superstorm Sandy, flooding homes, and leaving thousands without heat and power.

Disaster relief organizations like FEMA and the National Guard have been sent in, but many in the hardest-hit areas remain without power.

Volunteer workers like Mr Applewhite have been working with LIPA to help customers still stuck in the dark.
