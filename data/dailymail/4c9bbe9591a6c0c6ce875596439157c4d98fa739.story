Millions of workers are ‘too frightened’ about losing their job to take time off work when they are sick, even if they are very ill, a report reveals today.

The authoritative report says a culture of ‘presenteeism’ is sweeping Britain as workers decide to come into the office, rather than stay home in bed.

A third of bosses have seen an increase in the number of workers ‘who struggle into work when unwell’ over the last year, according to the report from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.

Overall, the average number of sick days taken by workers in both the public and private sector has dropped from an average of 7.7 days last year to 6.8 days this year.

In the private sector, the average number of sick days per worker has fallen from 6.5 per year in 2011 to 5.8 days this year.

And among State workers, who are the worst offenders for taking large numbers of sick days, it has dropped to 7.9, the lowest level for a decade.

Dr Jill Miller, a research adviser at the CIPD, said: ‘We are seeing employees struggling into work to demonstrate their commitment.

‘Presenteeism can be a sign of anxiety.’

The report, which polled nearly 670 bosses in Britain, reveals how many workers are terrified of losing their job during the long economic downturn.

It said: ‘Employees struggle to work while ill to demonstrate their commitment, particularly when their job security is threatened.’

One in two bosses say they use their worker’s ‘employee absence record’, which lists how many days they have taken off work, when working out who to make redundant.

Professor Cary Cooper, an expert in organisational psychology from the Lancaster University Management School, said the results are ‘worrying’.

He said: ‘People are so frightened that they are turning up to work when they are unwell.

‘At this time of such high job insecurity, would you want to be ill and off work? No.’

His own poll of 39,000 workers found nearly 30 per cent have suffered from ‘sickness presenteeism’ - that is, coming into work when ill - at some point over the last 12 months.

Stress is the most common cause of long-term sickness absence for white-collar as well as blue-collar workers, dubbed the ‘21st-century equivalent of the Black Death’, according to the CIPD.

Long-term absence is defined as taking four weeks or more off work at one time due to sickness.

The CIPD said coming into work when ill can have ‘a damaging effect’. Most importantly, it can spread the illness, such as flu, among other colleagues.

But is also means the worker is less effective than usual, is prone to make ‘costly mistakes’ and will take longer to recover from their illness.

In a sign of the extreme presenteeism culture in Britain, the news that the chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group was timing time off work due to exhaustion caused widespread shock.

Antonio Horta-Osorio, who returned to work in January, later described how he would ‘go to bed exhausted but could not get to sleep’, adding: ‘I could not switch off.’

The Portugese-born boss, who spent a week in the mental health clinic, the Priory, said the gruelling experience meant he now understood why sleep deprivation is used to torture prisoners.
