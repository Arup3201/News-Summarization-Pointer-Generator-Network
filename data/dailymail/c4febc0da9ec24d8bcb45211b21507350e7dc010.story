David Cameron risks splitting the Conservative party if he abandons the green agenda, senior MPs have warned.

The Prime Minister was confronted by more than 25 Tory ministers and MPs demanding he stick to his promises on the environment.

It follows reports he told aides to ‘get rid of all this green crap’ amid warnings that abandoning the modernisation of the Tory party will cost him the next election.

Pressure: David Cameron has been warned he risks splitting the Tory party if he abandons his modernisation programme

Mr Cameron has struck an increasingly strident tone on immigration, Europe and benefits, designed to appeal to Tory traditionalists who have defected to the UK Independence Party.

At the same time some of the flagship policies of his early leadership including the environment and the Big Society have been quietly dropped.

They want to hold Mr Cameron to his promise to lead the 'greenest government ever'.

At a showdown meeting on Friday afternoon, more than 25 Conservative MPs packed into the Prime Minister’s office in the House of Commons to voice their dismay at the direction of the party.

One MP who was there told The Times the meeting was an attempt to ‘flex our muscles’ in defiance at the higher profile right-wing of the party.

The meeting was organised by Laura Sandys, the MP for South Thanet who yesterday announced she will quit the Commons at the next election after being first elected in 2010.

She follows Louise Mensch, who left Parliament last year, and Lorraine Fullbrook who has also announced she will not contest the South Ribble seat again.

Downing Street expected at least half a dozen of the MPs elected in 2010 to quit, citing family pressures and frustrations at the way the party system works.

At Friday’s meeting normally loyal MPs made clear to Mr Cameron their growing anxiety about the direction of his leadership and the risk it poses to hopes of winning an outright majority in 2015.

It included energy minister Greg Barker, an early Cameroon, and strident green campaigner Zac Goldsmith.

Also there were former minister Charles Hendry and Oliver Colville, who was elected in 2010.

One MP said: ‘You could see that he was taken aback that this wasn't just half a dozen usual suspects but MPs representing many different wings of the party.’

Another person at the meeting said: ‘It got quite feisty, with some quite interesting interventions from people you don't normally see stepping out of line.

‘There were some MPs representing constituency interests saying that most of the jobs in their patch were green jobs and that his loose talk on the environment risked giving investors the jitters.’

Another MP said: ‘The real significance was that the “other side” those who are sceptical — have tended to act as a bloc and have been quite rebellious, while those of us who support the green agenda can and have been taken for granted. This was the first time we have flexed our muscles and that will have come as a shock.’

Chancellor George Osborne is expected to use next week’s Autumn Statement to announce cuts to the green levies imposed on energy bills, which would instead be funded from general taxation.

He will promise to save customers more than the £120 over two years promised by Ed Miliband’s freeze in bills which has seen Labour take the lead in the cost of living debate.
