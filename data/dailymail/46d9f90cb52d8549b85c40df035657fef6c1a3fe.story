After weeks of audition news, Sasheer Zamata has beat out a dozen other black comediennes to land a coveted spot on Saturday Night Live.

SNL creator Lorne Michaels decided to break tradition and hire a new cast member mid-season after facing criticism that his show lacked diversity for going six straight seasons without a woman of color.

A spokesman at NBC confirmed Zamata's hire on Monday. A stand-up comic, Zamata is also an alumna of Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, the improv comedy troupe founded by former-SNL star Amy Poehler.  She currently acts in the online web series 'Pursuit of Sexiness'.

Zamata will make her debut during the January 18 episode, which will be hosted by Drake.

Hired: It was announced on Monday that Sasheer Zamata will be the newest addition to Saturday Night Live, filling a black female cast member void created when Maya Rudolph left the show in 2007

She beat out NBC Universal Diversity Scholarship winner Natasha Rothwell and sketch-comic Kerry Coddett in the final round of auditions.

Zamata's competitor Coddett was one of the many critics of the show's lack of diversity, going to far as to write a scathing essay on the Huffington Post responding to a comment from black cast member Kenan Thompson who said the show often auditions black females but finds they're never 'ready'.

Coddett pointed to the show hosted by Kerry Washington in November, saying perhaps it was the white male dominated SNL writing room that wasn't ready to handle black female characters.

'The SNL writers showed what they could do with a "ready" black actress: pigeonhole her. They took an Emmy-nominated actress and made her play a nagging girlfriend; a sassy eye-rolling assistant; and a rage-filled Ugandan beauty queen,' Coddett wrote. 'Why can't they create interesting and funny characters outside race? How long will it take the SNL writers to learn that black is not a punch line?'

Rumors that a new player might be added 
to the cast started last month, when Gothamist reported that auditions 
were held earlier at the Groundlings theater for black 
female comediennes in LA.

The rumor was confirmed by SNL's creator and producer Lorne Michaels who told the New York Times that a black female cast member will join the cast in January - the first time Michaels can remember adding a cast member mid-season.

'All told we've seen about 25 people,'
 Michaels told the Times. 'A lot of people we saw are really good. 
Hopefully we'll come out of the process well.'

Michaels
 also revealed that he had vetted two black female players when he was 
initially hiring for the current season this past fall.

He
 saw the two women during a performance in Chicago, but their 
performances weren't as strong when they were invited to New York for 
the final auditions.

'Then when the deck got reshuffled and as we premiered we realized, it looks a different way,' he said.

That's when he started the unusual process of searching for a new cast member mid-season.

Michaels
 says he can't remember ever adding a new cast member in the middle of 
the season, but says he has added players in March or April to get them 
into the last episodes of the season.

While many have criticized the show 
for not having anyone to play prominent black females like first lady 
Michelle Obama, Beyonce or Oprah, Michaels says that has nothing to do 
with his hiring decision.

'That's a weird sort of way of looking at it because you don't judge comedy that way. Versatility is what we look for.'

This will be the first time since 2007 that SNL has had a woman of African-American heritage on the show.

Four black women: In its nearly 40 years on the air, Saturday Night live
 has hired just four black women. The first was Yvonne Hudson, right, and Danitra Vance, left, spent the 
1985-86 season on the show

No more: After Ellen Cleghorn, left, left the cast in 1995, there wouldn't be another black woman until Maya Rudolph in 2000. Rudolph left in 2007 and there hasn't been a black woman on the show since

The two current black cast members- Kenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah- were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag.

As a result, there have been no 
sketches on the weekly program featuring black females this season, excepting the episode which was hosted by Kerry Washington.

'SNL' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975, including Maya Rudolph who is biracial.

Done: Cast member Kenan Thompson announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women. He had played the likes of Whoopi Goldberg (right), Raven Symone and Aretha Franklin in the past

'It's not like it's not a priority for us,' Michaels said in an interview with The Associated Press in early November. 'It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.'

News of the invitation-only auditions that have been taking place in Los Angeles and Chicago broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet.

Actress Bresha Webb said she was 'honored' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance.

'It was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but, if you stay ready you ain't gotta get ready and we were READY!,' she told TheJasmineBrand.com.

'I can share that we all entered the Groundlings theater backstage having no idea what to expect. I had no clue who was apart of the showcase. Of course my comedienne friends (Tiffany Haddish, Beth Payne and Gabrielle Dennis) were there. And some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that I had never met,' she said.

It's happening: SNL's creator Lorne Michaels confirmed that a new black female comedienne will be added to the cast this January following reports that a 'secret' audition were held earlier this month in LA (those asked to audition pictured)

Simone Shepherd, Lekendra Tookes, Azie Dungey, Amber Ruffin, Damirra Brunson, Nicole Byer and Mistry Monroe also auditioned according to Jezebel.

'We were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness,' Ms Webb said.

'We were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot. We even held hands prayed after the showcase. It was refreshing. The show was also sold out. It was packed to the max.'

The timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to the high-profile departure of cast member and head Seth Meyers, who will leave in the New Year to host Late Night when Jimmy Fallon goes to The Tonight Show.
