John Terry could be asked to replace Roy Keane as an ITV World Cup pundit if the Irishman quits for a job at Aston Villa.

Chelsea captain Terry, who retired from international football in 2012, has been installed by bookmakers as the favourite to replace Keane.

Neither camp would confirm any approach but the possibility of Terry working at the World Cup is intriguing.

Brazil bound? John Terry could be heading to the World Cup as a pundit with ITV

On opposite sides: If ITV do sign Terry up then it would put him up against BBC's Rio Ferdinand

For starters, it would pitch him head-to-head against former England team-mate Rio Ferdinand, who is among the BBC pundits.

The pair fell out after Terry was charged with racially abusing Rio’s brother Anton during a game against QPR and although he was cleared in court he was banned by the FA.

As a former England captain, Terry has a chequered history with the World Cup. He lead a failed mutiny against Fabio Capello’s methods at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.

Meanwhile, Keane is expected to be named as Paul Lambert’s No 2 at Villa once he returns from two Ireland friendlies in the USA next week.

Keane’s decision to pull out of his role as an ITV pundit means he has more time to invest in a return to Premier League football.

Lambert has been on the lookout for a new assistant since Ian Culverhouse was suspended in April. Persuading Keane to join him would be a coup.

It had appeared Celtic would appoint the 42-year-old as their manager but it is understood a lack of transfer funds and the probable loss of England goalkeeper Fraser Forster swayed Keane’s mind.

Lambert, 44, has been in discussions with Keane for a number of days, and both men share a deep loyalty to the methods of Brian Clough.

Keane would be able to remain Ireland assistant if he took up the role on offer at Villa.
