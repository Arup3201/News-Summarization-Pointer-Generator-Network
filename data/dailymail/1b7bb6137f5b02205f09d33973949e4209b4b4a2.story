When the Duchess of Cambridge wore that sapphire
blue Issa dress for her engagement announcement in 2010, she sparked 
one of the first of many 'Kate Middleton' fashion frenzies.

The
£522 dress, a silk wrap design by Brazilian designer Daniella Helayel, 
was subsequently reproduced in the same shade and went on to 
sell out again and again on net-a-porter and in Harvey Nichols, as 'copy-Kates' rushed out to emulate their style icon.

Now, a more purse-friendly version has been unveiled as the star piece in the brand's new capsule collection for Banana Republic, which goes on sale next month.

That dress: The Duchess of Cambridge put Issa on the map when she donned their blue wrap dress for her engagement photographs, and now they are coming to a high-street near you

The £65 jersey dress is shorter but features ruched detail and a wrap waist like the original

The £65 jersey dress is a tad shorter than the original sell-out version but still features a wrap waist and ruched detailing. It's available in both navy and plum and another similar style features short sleeves and a deep V-neck.

The
collaboration was first announced back in April 2013, almost two years after 
Camilla Al Fayed bought a majority stake in the company and one month 
before founder and designer Daniella left the brand following rumours 
that both sides were unhappy.

The
40 piece collection promises that Kate Middleton's style 'will soon be 
within reach' thanks to a limited edition range that includes plenty of 
Duchess inspired wrap dresses as well as light knits, tops and 
accessories starting at £30.

There are several versions of the sell out engagement dress in the collection including a £75 sleeveless style (left) and a £65 short plum piece (right)

Speaking about the project earlier this year Simon
Kneen, Banana Republic's creative director and executive vice president
of design, told WWD: 'We always love animal prints such as zebra and 
giraffe stripes.

'Issa took that and modernised it. I love that the collection is our world and their world.'

Brazilian designer Daniella left the company after nine years, saying in May:'The time has come for me to move on to 
focus on my art, travel and other interests,' said Helayel in a statement released today.

'Creating Issa has been one
of the most rewarding things in my life. I may be leaving, but the Issa
girl will live forever in my heart.'

Camilla Al Fayed, daughter of ex-Harrods owner Mohammed Al Fayed, remains the majority shareholder as she oversees the company's global expansion.
