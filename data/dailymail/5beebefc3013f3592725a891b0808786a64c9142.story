The U.S. Department of Justice has offered major news organizations a chance to sit down with Eric Holder, the embattled attorney general, for a briefing a Q-and-A session about his agency's intrusive surveillance of reporters, but there is one catch: The entire session must be 'off the record,' meaning reporters couldn't write anything at all about it.

Most of the media outlets invited to the meeting have announced that they're boycotting it, including the Associated Press and Fox News - the two whose phone records and emails were secretly seized as part of DOJ investigations into national security leaks. And Brad Woodhouse, the communications director for the Democratic National Committee, is angry.

He tweeted Thursday that President Barack Obama asked Holder 'to review how leak investigations are done but some in the media refuse to meet with him.'

That, Woodhouse said, '[k]ind of forfeits your right [to] gripe.'

Cue the outrage, which came equally from journalists on the political right and left.

Brad Woodhouse, the Americans United for Change spokesman who now flacks for the Democratic National Committee, didn't make any friends in the media on Thursday

Woodhouse started the fracas by slamming the Associated Press, Fox News, the New York Times, the Huffington Post and other news outlets that refused to attend an 'off the record' briefing with Eric Holder, the embattled attorney general

Don Surber, an editorial writer at The Daily Mail - not this news organization's print edition in London, but a daily newspaper in Charleston, West Virginia - snarked in a tweeted reply that 'forfeits your right' is 'the motto of this administration.'

'Oh, and Brad Woodhouse,' Surber followed up in a later tweet, 'your rights come from God. You cannot forfeit them.'

Politico media reporter Dylan Byers was more succinct. 'Jesus, Brad,' he tweeted.

Gregg Keller, the executive director of the American Conservative Union, seemed to take joy in seeing the left-leaning Politico cross swords with the Democratic Party. His tweeted response consisted of one long guffaw: 'HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.'

Byers' news organization is among a list of very few that have said they will meet with the attorney general on his terms. Others include ABC News, the Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and the LA Times and Chicago Tribune, which share a Washington bureau chief in common.

Politico's Dylan Byers, who reports on the media, is on a first-name basis with the top Democratic communicator but didn't like what he heard

Buzzfeed's Andrew Kaczynski slapped back, referring to the Department of Justice's now-scandalous seizure of phone records and emails from AP and Fox News journalists

'TV's Andy Levy,' as he's introduced each night on the Fox News program 'Red Eye,' took a break from his daily yuk-fest to launch a serious barb in Woodhouse's direction

CNN, CBS News, Reuters, McClatchy, The New York Times and The Huffington Pot have joined Fox News and The Associated Press in refusing to attend.

The Washington Post's agreement to meet with Holder has raised eyebrows in the nation's capital, but Post executive editor Marty Baron defended his decision on his newspaper's media blog.

'I prefer that any meeting be on the record,' Baron said. But 'journalists routinely participate in off-the-record sessions, whether they prefer those conditions or not, and then continue to report on events.

'I am going to this meeting in order to represent our interests as journalists and to raise our concerns. I’ll also listen to what the Attorney General has to say. I trust that our journalists will report on this as vigorously as they would any other subject.

Ron Fournier, the editorial director at National Journal and a respected voice inside the DC beltway, took isdue with how Woodhouse suggested government should balance the press's First Amendment protections with national security issues

Is Woodhouse right? Journalists do meet with sources for 'off the record' conversations all the time ...

There's the rub: Reporters set the terms. Sources can't force journalists to listen -- something he thinks an experienced political spokesman should know

Andrew Kaczynski, a BuzzFeed Politics journalist who is a widely acknowledged master of reporting on political archival videos, connected the DOJ's request for secret meetings with its equally secretive snooping on the AP and Fox News.

If Holder and his staff want reactions from journalists, he tweeted, 'I suppose they can just find how they feel via subpoenaed email and phone records.'

The Daily Caller's house blogger, Sean Medlock - a conservative humorist who writes under the pseudonym 'Jim Treacher,' was quick to pour salt in Woodhouse's wounds.

'Notice how people on both sides of the aisle are pointing out how dumb that is?' he wrote. 'You must be doing all kinds of things right.'

Conservative partisans aplenty complemented journalists from left-leaning outlets like Politico and Buzzfeed. Surber is an editorial writer for that 'other' Daily Mail, the newspaper in Charleston, West Virginia

Josh Earnest, the White House's principal deputy press secretary, took questions from reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday, and the topic quickly turned to Holder's attempted charm offensive aimed at journalists.

'You can understand that a meeting about concerns journalists have about the First Amendment being off the record is sort of on its face hypocritical, don’t you?' asked one reporter, according to the White House's transcript.

'No,' Earnest replied. 'I don’t actually see that. ... I don’t think there's any doubting the seriousness with which the attorney general is pursuing what he has identified and what the president has identified as a genuine priority. And we are genuinely interested in the input, the opinion, the advice, the expertise of leaders of prominent media organizations.'

'Is the President at all concerned that Holder is just under so much scrutiny at this point that it might affect his ability to get his job done?' the reporter pressed Earnest?

'Not in the least,' came his reply.

New York Post columnist and Commentary magazine editor John Podhoretz sniped at the Democratic spokesman's tweet-grammar, among other thigns

The AIDS Policy Project took issue with Woodhouse and hat-tipped the New York Times for being among the first to show 'some spine' in turning the administration down flat

But reporters themselves - those who tweet, in any event - saw the White House as hypocritical and Woodhouse as foolish.

'Wow,' Fox News personality Andy Levy, a co-star of the nightly show Red Eye, tweeted at Woodhouse. 'It's hard to believe Americans are cynical about politics with people like you around.'

National Journal editorial editor director Ron Fournier, a former Associated Press bureau chief in Washington, checked his sarcasm at the door and engaged Woodhouse seriously.

'The balance between security/liberty deserves better than your spin,' he wrote.

There's 'lot of spin on both sides, Woodhouse wrote, in the his only tweeted reply to a reporter. 'Are journos not going saying they never meet with subjects off the record? Happens everyday.'

'On our terms,' Fournier snapped. 'Not the government's.'
