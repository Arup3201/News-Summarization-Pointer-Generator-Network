Australian children's health specialists say Prince George is an advanced baby with excellent developmental skills for a child of his age.

Sydney paediatricians who observed his responses in photographs and on television footage of his two public appearances say the nine-month-old is progressing well and his parents should be pleased their child is in the top range for his age.

'He looks like a very mobile baby who actively plays with toys and crawls around and he could be almost walking which is very good at nine months,' said Dr Antonia Milner of the Sydney Children's Hospital.

Between arriving in New Zealand (above, left) for the start of his parents' three week royal tour Down Under, and leaving Australia three weeks later (above, right) Prince George may have undergone a 'developmental growth spurt' in his skills. Certainly the Duke and Duchess said he was carrying an 'extra roll of fat' after being spoilt by his carers while his parents travelled

Prince George was delighted when he was presented with the giant plush toy wombat by Australia's Governor-General Peter Cosgrove at Admiralty House on the family's first day in Australia

'A mobile baby who will go after the toys he wants, and perhaps pulling himself up to stand, chucking a toy to the ground is all good.

"And if he's standing alone, waving bye bye and clapping or saying more than 'Mum' and "Dad" that would be very advanced.

'He looks like he might be about to walk. It's probably a little bit early for a nine-month-old. The fact he's playing with babies or small children, that's more likely than responding to adults who aren't his parents.

'But getting excited with the little animal in the zoo, that's pretty advanced. [The Duke and Duchess] do have a pet dog I know that, so he might have experience with animals through that.

'He's obviously aware of the world and interested in the world. It's lovely to see such an aware baby.'

Paediatrician and developmental specialist Dr Lee Sutton said she was impressed with Prince George's focus on the animal named after him at Taronga Zoo, the bilby.

Bilby keeper Paul Davies, who was up close to the baby and the bilby during the zoo encounter said he 'had never seen a little boy so excited about meeting a bilby. He had his hands on the glass and he was patting the glass. He did make a grab for the bilby's ears'.

'He does love it honestly,' said William as his son threw the toy bilby on the floor. The toy was presented to him on a visit to the Australian Nightlife enclosure last weekend. The infant Prince was given the soft toy by the zoo director who hoped the royal visit would help highlight efforts to conserve the country's native animals

Prince George is going through his 'oral phase; in which he sticks just about everything in his nouth - including this car sticker, which he proceeded to chew while flinging the toy bilby to the dirt

According to Sydney developmental paediatric specialist Dr Lee Sutton, Prince George's reaction in the bilby enclosure showed 'very good gross motor skills' and the fact he was 'standing up, holding onto the railing and he was pointing at the bilby was really nice because he's only nine months old'

Dr Sutton said Prince George's alertness and awareness of his surroundings was obvious and a key sign he had not only reached the normal milestones for a child his age, but may be slightly ahead of other babies.

'His gross motor skills are good,' Dr Sutton said, 'he's standing up, holding onto the railing and he was pointing at the bilby.

'That's really nice because he's only nine months old.'

The young prince was also seen to be reaching out to another animal - albeit a stuffed version, the wombat gift from Australian Governor General, Sir Peter Cosgrove, which Prince William later revealed George had taken to chewing 'lovingly'.

Dr Milner said it was normal for a nine-month-old to be chewing toys.

'It has nothing to do with development whether a child has several teeth at that age, or no teeth at all,' she said.

'They have teeth underneath and their gums are very firm and babies are going through that oral phase when they are good at chewing food.

'His [Prince George's] parents may have been feeding him mushed up stuff, it could still be very liquid, but he could be eating sandwiches.

Prince George displayed 'lovely development' and was 'quite social and engaging' said Sydney paediatrician Dr Lee Sutton, 'and he's crawling and pulling to stand. That's good'

'It depends on the parents, or the nanny. Many parents don't realise they can eat sandwiches and he would be really keen on feeding himself.

'Children that age are keen on holding food up to their mouths. He would be starting to become an independent toddler.'

The little prince - who the Palace has revealed has four or five teeth coming through at the moment - reached out chubby arms for the furry toy bilby he received at Taronga Zoo, chewed on it for a few 
moments, before throwing it to the floor and attempting to eat another gift, a yellow car sticker that read 'Wild child on board'.

At his earlier outing, in New Zealand, his very first official engagement at Government House in Wellington, Prince George managed to divide and rule - and still impress the experts.

The Prince was taken among ten babies, all of whom were born within a few weeks of his own birthday, on July 22 last year, and appeared already comparatively solid from head to foot and with chunky little legs.

At first the then eight-month-old was held by his mother, as she chatted with other parents.

Perhaps bored by this adult interaction, George waved his arms and kicked his legs, getting another baby's attention, after which he touched her face and then grabbed her toy wooden doll.

Given a blue plastic block by the Duchess as a substitute, he threw that to the floor and was eventually placed down on the carpet by his mother.

George immediately set off at a gallop grabbing toys indiscriminately including a toy tambourine, a drum and a spiral puzzle, with which he became very taken, holding it in the air and giggling as he played on the floor.

The Duchess of Cambridge has said this is her favourite photograph from the tour Down Under, of herself with a smiling Prince George on her shoulder in New Zealand. The royal couple can take heart that while they were collecting happy memories, the young prince was also making important developments and impressing local doctors with his skills and engagement

Dr Sutton said the toy throwing was an 'absolutely normal' stage known in child medicine as 'casting' .

'You still often see that stage happening at ten or eleven months old,' she said, 'and he's crawling and pulling to stand. that's good,' she said.

'I thought he showed lovely development and he was quite social and engaging.'

Dr Milner said the lively interaction with other young children was a good sign and perhaps the prince had undergone a string of developments while his parents were on tour.

'The funny thing about the way nine month olds develop is they have a little spurt - it's like a growth spourt, but it's developmental - when they have a few days over which they might start doing quite a few new things.'

Dr Milner said Prince George's parents were in for an exciting time with their son's development over the coming months.

'There will be more words coming and he'll start putting words together,' she said.

'He'll start showing his mother the particular things he's actually interested in and he'll start putting objects in and out of containers.

'Then he might play with dolls. It depends what his parents give them, but my son was playing with his teddy bear and pushing it round in a pram, just as little girls play with dolls and "feed' them and "put them to bed".'
