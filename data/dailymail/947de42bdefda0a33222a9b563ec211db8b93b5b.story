The daughter of an American tourist whose body was found stuffed into a suitcase at a luxury resort in Bali has been charged with her murder - and could face death by firing squad.

Under Indonesian law, Heather Lois Mack, 19, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, could face the grisly end for the killing of Sheila von Wiese-Mack. Both were charged on Friday.

'We have a great deal of evidence that, 
piece by piece, builds up to a picture that points very strongly to 
their guilt,' Chief Inspector General Albertus Mokalu said.

The body of Von Wiese Mack, 62, from Oak Park, 
Illinois, was found half naked inside a suitcase that had 
been wrapped in a garbage bag and put into a taxi outside the family's hotel on Tuesday.

Mack 
appeared panicked as the suitcase was placed in the car and told the 
driver that she was going to get her mother, witnesses 
said.

But
 when the couple left and did not return for two hours, the taxi driver 
called police and the blood-marked suitcase was recovered from outside 
the high-end St Regis Hotel in Denpasar.

Chief Inspector General Mokalu said the couple were charged after evidence began to mount up against them.

Among the evidence, surveillance footage showed Mack and her boyfriend arguing with her mother in 
the hotel lobby, while more security footage showed them all entering 
the room where Mrs Mack was allegedly bludgeoned to death.

He
 added that other evidence included fingerprints on the silver suitcase 
in which her body was found and the fact that the couple had fled out 
through the rear part of the hotel after depositing the suitcase in a 
waiting taxi.

Police
 allege the pair had also used Mrs Mackâ€™s credit card to pay for their 
room at the Risata Bali resort and spa, a short distance from the 
airport, where they were arrested on Wednesday.

Victim: Sheila von Wiese-Mack, pictured right with her daughter, was a wealthy academic from Chicago

The
 pair told investigators that von Wiese-Mack was killed by robbers while
 they managed to escape, the police chief for Bali's provincial capital 
of Denpasar, Col. Djoko Hari Utomo said.

But Utomo said that account contradicted testimonies by the taxi driver and hotel employees.

Before
 she was charged, Mack's Chicago-based lawyer, Michael Elkin, said the 
claims made about his client were untrue and that she was 'hysterical' 
when they spoke.

Elkin said he had met her a few times in Chicago and when she realized she needed an attorney she called him in tears. He said she sounded 'numb' when she called his office before her arrest.

'It appeared to me that she was trying to keep it together,' Elkin told a Chicago NBC affiliate. 'She needed assistance in getting to the embassy and how to go about it.'

Aldina Kahari, an associate in Elkin's office said when she spoke to Heather in Indonesia police had refused to leave the room despite her requests.

'During my 
brief conversation with Heather, I was made aware that a police guard 
was present in the room, even after I requested that I be able to speak 
to Heather without anyone being present,' Kahari said in a statement.

Kahari said Heather had initially been denied access to an attorney which she called 'quite disconcerting'.

Elkin said he is not representing Tommy Scahefer.

The police say they are looking to upgrade the charges to premeditated murder.

'Why premeditated? Because the victim was stuffed into a bag. It shows planning,' police chief Benny Mokalu told Fairfax Media.

It
 has also emerged that Mack told police she was pregnant and she was 
seen being taken to the obstetrics and gynecology section of a police 
hospital in Bali for tests on Friday, News Corp reported.

Both Mack and Schaefer are also undergoing psychological and other tests, police said.

Witnesses told police that Mrs von Weise-Mack, her daughter and Schaefer had a fight at the reception desk of St Regis Hotel before her body was taken from the hotel in the silver case.

Staff have told police the trio argued about who should pay the bill when they were due to check-out.

According 
to a staff reconstruction of the argument, Mrs von Weise-Mack was seen 
telling her daughter: 'I've paid for his flight here, so the two of you 
should pay for the hotel.'

Von
 Wiese-Mack's body was being autopsied at a hospital in Denpasar. Head 
of Forensics Ida Bagus Putu Alit said there were signs of violence on 
the body indicating the victim fought before she died.

'We found scars on both forearms and the broken left-hand fingernail,' Alit said following an external examination. 'That indicated a resistance in a fight.'

After leaving the lobby area, Mack and Schaefer arrived in the reception area with a large
 suitcase wrapped in a bed sheet, refusing to allow a porter to take it 
out to a waiting taxi.

According to reports from Bali, the suspects so far have refused to co-operate with investigators.

Videos have also emerged showing the couple partying hard in the hotel, allegedly after stealing Mrs Mack's credit card.

Back in the U.S., where all three lived in an upscale Chicago suburb, authorities examined records of 86 incidents in which police were called to the family's home.

The calls started in 2004 and ended in June 2013, around the time the family moved out, according to village of Oak Park spokesman David Powers.

The bulk of the calls were missing-person reports, and others included domestic problems and theft, but none resulted in arrests, he said.

He added there were a number of emergency 911 calls made from the residence in which the caller hung up, and, as is standard procedure, the police department sent a squad car to investigate.
