Zlatan Ibrahimovic isn't known for being shy and he was quick to show off the signed gift he was given following his impressive hat-trick in Paris Saint-Germain's 3-1 win over Lorient.

The Swedish international has had a difficult few weeks following his sending off against Chelsea in the Champions League and his foul-mouthed rant at the officials following the league defeat against Bordeaux.

Ibrahimovic took to Instagram where he posted the photo of his signed match ball.

He said: 'For those of you who are wondering where the ball is...'

PSG are just a point ahead of Lyon in Ligue 1, coming into the final matches of the campaign knowing that they can't afford to slip up if they want to retain the title.

With a Champions League quarter-final place and currently top of the table, the French champions have potential for a great season but will need their talisman to keep on firing.
