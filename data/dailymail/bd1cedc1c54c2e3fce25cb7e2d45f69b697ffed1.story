At the end of last year Apple overtook sales of Android devices for the first time since 2012. 

And in a bid to fuel this trend further, the Californian tech giant is reportedly planning to extend its recycling and trade-in scheme to include rival handsets. 

Reports claim Android, as well as BlackBerry and potentially Windows Phone customers, will be able to exchange their handsets for gift cards and credit towards Apple products.

Apple is reportedly planning to extend the recycling and trade-in scheme it launched in 2013 (pictured) to include rival handsets. Reports claim Android, as well as BlackBerry and potentially Windows Phone customers, will be able to exchange their handsets for gift cards and credit towards an Apple product

These reports first appeared on fan site 9to5Mac and came from unnamed sources. 

Apple launched its iPhone Reuse and Recycle trade-in scheme in 2013. 

It lets people take old handsets into a store and get credit to put towards the purchase of a new one.

These handsets can be recycled online too, and Apple offers an iPad version of the scheme.

The amount of credit depends on the device and its condition, and its likely that figures for Android handsets, which are typically much cheaper than Apple phones, will be low under the scheme.

Apple has not confirmed these plans but the report said the scheme could roll out 'in the coming weeks.' The latest smartphone sales data show that Apple’s share of sales grew last year thanks to the iPhone 6 (left). Samsung will be hoping to claw some of this back with its Galaxy S6 (right)

The latest smartphone sales data from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech show that Apple’s share of sales grew across the US, Europe and China during the fourth quarter of 2014.

In the US, Apple iOS overtook Android for the first time since 2012 albeit by 0.1%. 

Across Europe, Android’s share declined by 3.8% year-on-year to 66.1 per cent while iOS rose by 6.2%.

The UK had the biggest impact on the decline as iOS grew its share by  13.1% compared to this time last year with Samsung, LG and Sony all losing market share year-on-year.

Apple has not confirmed these plans, but the report continued employees in stores are being trained on the changes now and the scheme could roll out 'in the coming weeks.'
