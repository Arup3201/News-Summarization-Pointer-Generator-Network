As petrol becomes ever more expensive, car manufacturers are racing to develop vehicles that are fast, fuel-efficient and can run on biofuels.

Now a British manufacturer has launched a sports model that not only exceeds speeds of 190mph - it is said to be capable of driving from Land’s End to John O’Groats and back on a single tank of cooking oil.

Makers Trident claims its Iceni model is the world’s fastest and most fuel efficient sports car - and it's pretty good looking too.

Speedy: A British manufacturer called Trident has launched the Iceni sports car (pictured) that has a top speed of 190mph and can drive from Land's End to John O'Groats and back on a single tank of used cooking oil that can even be refined at home

Engine: 6.6 litre Turbo Diesel V8

Gearbox: 6 speed fully automatic

Power/Performance: 395brake horsepower with 700lbs ft of Torque.

Acceleration: 0-60mph in 3.7seconds

Top speed: Over 190mph.

Interior: 'Tilt and slide' steering column, air conditioning, electric windows, specially designed heated and electric seats trimmed in leather, a CD player and digital radio with MP3 and Bluetooth.

Fuel: Conventional diesel or pure biodiesel, such as cooking oil, virgin rapeseed, linseed palm, soya bean oil, kerosene and paraffin.

Price: From £96,000 ($161,578).

It can reportedly travel 2,000 miles on a single tank of mineral or bio-diesel and uses ‘torque multiplication technology’ to achieve its combination of speed, power and this fuel efficiency.

Prices start at £96,000 ($161,578) for the most basic version.

The Norfolk-based firm has unveiled three models - the Iceni Magna fastback and convertible as well as an estate version with a distinctive heart-shaped rear window, called the Iceni Venturer, all of which can go from 0 to 60 in just 3.7 seconds.

The models run on pure biodiesel, such as cooking oil, virgin rapeseed, linseed palm, soya bean oil, kerosene and paraffin.

Co-founder Phil Bevan told MailOnline that if the owner of one of his cars invested in refinery equipment - at a costs of £1,800 - they could make approximately 300litres of fuel a day by collecting used cooking oil from restaurants.

Efficient: Trident claims its Iceni model (pictured) is the world's fastest and most fuel efficient sports car. It can reportedly travel 2,000 miles on a single tank of mineral or bio-diesel and uses 'torque multiplication technology' to achieve its combination of speed, power and fuel efficiency

The cars also have enough room for four suitcases or even a set of golf clubs - essential for making the long trip from Cornwall to Scotland, which is 838miles by the most direct route.

‘The Trident cars deliver incredible speed and performance combined with outstanding fuel efficiency, achieved through our unique torque multiplication technology,’ said Phil Bevan, designer and founder of Trident.

'It is widely believed horsepower delivers power, speed and fuel efficiency, but it is torque that matters and ‘gets you off the line quickly,’ he told MailOnline.

Distinctive: The model is reminiscent of older sports cars and has 39 
bespoke components, including a clever roof so that a passenger can remain under cover even if the 
driver wants the roof down. The futuristic interior (left) and sports wheels (right) are pictured

Bevan claims Trident’s patented technology – a unique way of utilising torque multiplication to improve performance and efficiency - increases fuel efficiency by up to 20 per cent.  

The Iceni car ‘handles like a race car but rides like a saloon car and its shock absorbers are bespoke to give a grand touring feel,’ Bevan continued.

'It’s got a mid-front mounted engine, with everything is in the middle. It’s designed like a race car.’

British car makes use of fish and chips: The Iceni (pictured) can run on pure biodiesel, such as cooking oil from deep fat fryers, virgin rapeseed, linseed palm, soya bean oil, kerosene and paraffin

Thrice the fun: The Norfolk-based firm unveiled three models today - the Iceni Magna fastback, a convertible and an estate version with a distinctive heart-shaped rear window, called the Iceni Venturer (pictured), both of which can go from 0 to 60 in just 3.7 seconds

The models have a distinctive look, reminiscent of older sports cars and incorporate over 39 bespoke components, including independent control of each car seat and even the car’s roof.

This means a passenger can remain under cover even if the driver wants the roof down.

The company said its car can be built to suit customers’ specifications, and that prices start at £96,000 ($161,578).

Daniel Monaghan, co-founder of Trident added: ‘We have worked extremely hard to reach this point and the whole Trident team is thrilled to be bringing the world’s most fuel-efficient diesel sports cars to market.’
