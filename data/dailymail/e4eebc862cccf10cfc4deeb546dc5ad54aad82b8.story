An Army veteran has had his benefits slashed after he told Jobcentre staff that he had volunteered to sell poppies in honour of his former comrades.

Stephen Taylor, 60, was receiving £71.20 a week in Jobseeker's Allowance while searching for work after losing a previous job as a pub manager.

However, when he said he had been raising money for the Royal British Legion, they told him he was not doing enough to find a new job and withdrew the payment.

Anger: Army veteran Stephen Taylor had his benefits cut because he volunteered to sell poppies

Mr Taylor served as a Fusilier in Cuprus, Kenya and Northern Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s.

He volunteered to sell poppies outside an Asda in Bury, Greater Manchester, during the fortnight leading up to Remembrance Sunday this year, spending a total of 24 hours on the activity.

When he went to sign on and told workers about his volunteering, they stopped his Jobseekers' Allowance because they said he should be spending his time handing out CVs and applying for work.

Mr Taylor has now had to live without the payment for four weeks, and is increasingly struggling with his finances.

'The allowance is not very much, but when you don't have much, it means a lot,' the father of four said. 'It is all wrong. You volunteer and sell poppies to remember people and friends you have lost.'

He spent a total of 16 years in the military, serving with the 1st Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers and the Territorial Army from 1972 to 1988.

Good deed: Mr Taylor was raising money for the Royal British Legion in memory of his former comrades

Since then Mr Taylor has worked in a number of jobs, including managing pubs around the country, but he has not been employed since November last year.

He says he has applied for a number of jobs - including at the Asda store where he was volunteering - but has received just one response in the past 12 months.

'I have tried all sorts,' he said. 'There are no jobs going, but I am waiting for a call from one application.

'It is impossible. You can apply for every job that is going, but it is another thing actually getting one because there are that many people applying.'

The former soldier has had to seek financial support from the Bury Armed Forces Covenant group, but has nonetheless fallen behind with his rent.

Local councillor James Frith criticised the handling of Mr Taylor's case, saying: 'I was astonished. Any time I speak with Stephen you can tell that he has searching for work and has served his country throughout his life.

'For me, it is an issue of applying discretion and leniency in dealing with such sensitive issues.

'To treat somebody who has put himself in harm's way for the people of Bury and his country is unacceptable.'

A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: 'It's only right that people should do everything they can to find work in return for their benefits.

'We make it clear to people at the start of their claim what the rules are and that they risk losing their benefits if they don't play by them.

'Sanctions are only used as a last resort and people who are in genuine need can apply for hardship payments. If someone disagrees with a decision made on their claim, they can appeal.'
