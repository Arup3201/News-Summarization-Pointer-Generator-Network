Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Galatasaray and Benfica are the only two Champions League sides already out of every European competition at this point.

Arsenal have gone through the (1st) CL group stage for the fifteenth season in a row, the longest such run for an English club.

The Gunners could win the group with a victory if Borussia Dortmund lose against Anderlecht, or if the German side draw and Arsenal win by a six-goal margin.

Aaron Ramsey has scored four goals in five European appearances against Turkish opposition.

Burak Yilmaz has scored two of Galatasaray’s three CL goals this season, and their only goal against Arsenal earlier this campaign at the Emirates Stadium.

Yilmaz has scored 10 goals for the Turkish side in the Champions League, just three behind Hakan Sükür (13), Galatasaray’s top scorer in the competition.

Galatasaray have scored 99 goals in the Champions League.

Excluding penalty shootouts, Arsenal have never lost a European game against Turkish opposition (W6 D4), keeping a clean sheet in eight of these games.

In their last game against Borussia Dortmund, Arsenal kept their first clean sheet in a Champions League game since November 2013, after a run of seven games without one.

Santiago Cazorla assisted both Arsenal goals against Borussia Dortmund last week, being the first Gunner to assist more than one goal in a single CL game since Olivier Giroud against Montpellier at the Emirates (2-0, Nov 2012).

Galatasaray have not lost any of their last five European home games against English sides (W3 2D).
