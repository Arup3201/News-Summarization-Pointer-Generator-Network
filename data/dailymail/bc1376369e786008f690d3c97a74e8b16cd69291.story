When singer Tulisa Contostavlos rose from the sea like Ursula Andress in the Judges’ Houses section of X Factor, she showed off a super-toned body in a tiny bikini. 

The secret behind her trim new figure? It’s all down to yoga.

While she was going through the stress of a public court battle after a newspaper sting and establishing herself as a solo artist, Tulisa started training with London-based fitness instructor Peter Mac.

And nine months’ worth of downward dogs and chaturangas have clearly paid off. A typical session with Peter involves meditation to channel the reasons for working out, before moving on to a series of stretches. 

She’s also been working on her flexibility, using weighted bands around her ankles to increase the intensity.

A friend of the singer explains: ‘Tulisa’s really changed since starting yoga. Her figure’s incredible and she’s lost a lot of weight. Mentally, it’s given her a focus. She’s even slower to lose her temper.’

Perhaps her cousin and former N-Dubz bandmate Dappy should give it a go...

Children who skip breakfast 'more likely to be obese' 

Breakfast has long been labelled the most important meal of the day by nutritional experts. 

Now research published in the European Journal Of Clinical Nutrition from eight European countries has revealed that skipping breakfast can be detrimental to the health of children. 

Those who don’t eat breakfast at home have an increased chance of cardiovascular disease risk factors, according to the study involving more than 8,500 children between two and nine.

The study found that children who do not eat breakfast at home had a higher risk of being obese and of having abnormal cholesterol levels.

Children who breakfasted at home less frequently also engaged in less moderate-to-vigorous physical activity when compared with children eating a daily breakfast.

The UK is lagging behind Europe in treating heart valve disease, according to a report from the charity Heart Valve Voice. 

The charity has highlighted under-diagnosis and treatment gaps across the country for patients with the potentially fatal condition, which affects more than a million people over 65 in the UK. 

The report reveals that 59 per cent of people over the age of 60 do not have their heart checked with a stethoscope – the simplest way to identify heart valve disease. 

Fifty-four per cent of patients in some parts of the UK are not referred to a cardiac surgeon despite their diagnosis being confirmed, and many of those who are referred have already developed damage to the heart which can reduce the benefits of surgery. 

Thirty per cent of sufferers are left untreated despite options being available.

Need a reminder to calm down occasionally? 

A wearable stress sensor, the size of a small computer mouse and resembling a pebble, keeps tabs on your heart rate and breathing patterns, and sends you a message, via an app, with tips on how to calm down if it detects your stress levels rising.
