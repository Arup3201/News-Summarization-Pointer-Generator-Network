Arrest: Police in East Baton Rouge have arrested William Bouvay, 42, for making a bomb threat to the Louisiana State University's campus this week

An arrest has been made in the bomb threat that led to the evacuation of the LSU campus earlier this week while police don't believe he is connected to threats made against three other universities.

William Bouvay Jr., 42, of Baton Rouge was arrested on late Tuesday night after an investigation by multiple law enforcement agencies linked a cell phone having made the call to his neighbourhood, police report.

LSU Police Capt. Corey Lalonde said Bouvay was not an LSU student and appeared to have no connection to the campus. His Facebook profile depicts him as a religious man who became engaged earlier this year.

Capt Lalonde did not know what the suspect's motive might have been.

Investigators don't think Bouvay is connected to threats made last week at college campuses in Texas, North Dakota and Ohio.

'We don't believe at this point that there is any connection to the bomb threats at other universities,' Capt Lalonde said.

He said police tracked Bouvay down after determining the 911 call received Monday at 10.32 am CDT came from a deactivated cell phone that could only make emergency calls.

Motive: Bouvay was never an LSU student and appeared to have no connection to the campus with a motive for the bomb scare currently unknown

Personal details: Bouvay's Facebook photo is seen on his page which claims him being engaged to be married though little more about the suspect shown

Capt Lalonde said investigators were 
able to pinpoint the location of the cell phone on Tuesday and searched 
homes in the Baton Rouge neighbourhood before identifying Bouvay as a 
suspect.

'Upon questioning, he admitted to making the phone call,' Capt Lalonde said, adding that Bouvay has been cooperative.

Authorities said he will be charged with communicating false information of a planned bombing.

The threat set into motion a massive evacuation of the sprawling campus that sparked traffic jams as thousands left.

The caller didn't specify where on campus bombs might be planted, so bomb-squad officers with explosives-sniffing dogs were called in to search all buildings.

Closure: LSUPD spokesman Cory Lalonde is seen during a press conference on Wednesday, one day after classes resumed at the university and hours after an arrest was made

Efforts: Officers with a dog talk after searching one of the buildings on the LSU campus which had to be searched one-by-one with the bomb threat's caller not specifying a potential location

As with the threats made last week at the University of Texas, North Dakota State University and Hiram College, the search failed to turn up explosives.

Capt Lalonde said authorities believe Bouvay is the person who called the East Baton Rouge Parish 911 Center, claiming multiple bombs would detonate on campus within two hours.

The university was upbeat before Monday's threat after LSU rose to No. 2 in The Associated Press college football poll with a win over Idaho on Saturday.

Evacuation: Students are seen waiting for buses to take them off campus during the evacuation of an estimated 30,000 students, professors and employees

Officials believe a majority of the university's 30,000 students, professors and employees were on campus when the threat was made.

Students were allowed to return to dormitories late Monday night and classes resumed on Tuesday. An estimated 6,000 students live on campus.

Interim LSU President William Jenkins said he's pleased at how swiftly a suspect was identified and apprehended, but doesn't know why Bouvay targeted LSU.

'I'm very proud of our resilience, as disruptive and as harmful as this episode was. We're back at work and once again we're a productive, thriving university,' he said.
