A woman has been jailed after making a drunken 999 call to report that her dog had run away and her goldfish were dying.

Julie Jane Thompson, 54, from Cockermouth, Cumbria was previously given an ASBO ordering her not to make unnecessary 999 calls but she ignored this and called the emergency line while drunk in May.

She told the operator her dog had run away but was now back and her goldfish were dying. She went on to say that she was running out of tablets and was advised to call the out-of-hours GP service.

When police arrived Thompson said she had taken an overdose of paracetamol and an ambulance was called.

Later, after being taken to the police station, she took another overdose while waiting to be checked into custody.

She later admitted she was drunk at the time of the call and had not run out of medication.

Claire Kirkpatrick, Thompson's solicitor said: 'I think it's a case that she feels the need to talk to someone and she knows that at the end of the 999 service there will be someone.'

Judge Chalk sentenced Thompson to 70 days in prison for the breach with seven further days in lieu of outstanding fines. He said she had shown a 'total inability to deal with non-custodial sentences'.
