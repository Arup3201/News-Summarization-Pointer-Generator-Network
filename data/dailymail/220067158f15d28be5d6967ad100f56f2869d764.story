Suncream? Check. Parasol? Check. Towel? Check.

Now all you need is space to put them all.

That would have been a tall order at Southend-on-Sea yesterday, where these crowds proved that when Britain bakes the first destination on everyone’s mind is the beach.

As the mercury neared 30C (86F) in the
hottest spell of the year, these sunseekers were among the millions who
flocked to the coast to make the most of the sunshine. And the good 
news is that the glorious weather is set to last into next weekend and 
beyond.

The hottest parts of the country 
yesterday were Bournemouth and Heathrow, which at 29.7C (85.5F) were 
warmer than Ibiza and Istanbul.

The unbroken sunshine drew crowds of 
250,000 to Bournemouth alone, although there were complaints about the 
cans, bottles and other mess left behind at beaches in Brighton and 
Blackpool – and open spaces such as Richmond Park in south-west London.

Fiona Paterson wrote on Twitter: ‘Brighton beach is lovely but it is trashed! Please take rubbish away with you.’

The Met Office said dominant high 
pressure will keep the mercury high for the rest of the week in the best
July warm spell since 2006. Paul Mott at MeteoGroup added: ‘It will 
cool down a bit on Thursday, but next weekend it could be approaching 
30C (86F) again.’

Bookmaker William Hill has now cut the odds of a hosepipe ban from 7/1 to 5/1.

The fine weather resulted in tragedy 
on Saturday, when a boy died while swimming in a disused quarry near 
Malvern, Worcestershire.

In South Wales, a 14-year-old girl is still missing after getting into difficulty off Whitmore Bay, Barry Island.
