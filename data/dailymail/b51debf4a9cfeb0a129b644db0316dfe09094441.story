British Game of Thrones fans are paying up to £60 more than U.S. shoppers to get their hands on the same products.

Research comparing the price of merchandise on HBO's online store found the huge mark-ups stretch to jewellery, clothing and even toys.

A sterling silver Targaryen pendant costs £62.99 in the UK - but only £39.45 across the pond.

A bookend in the shape of the Iron Throne is nearly £20 more expensive if you order it in the UK while a letter opener is £8.95 more. 

Even shoppers interested in buying small figurines have to fork out £4.62 more in the UK - an increase of more than 25 per cent. 

UK shoppers also pay around 13 per cent more than some of their European counterparts, The Sun reported. 

Rob Davies, a 21-year-old fan of the show, said that fans 'should be treated equally'.

Another fan, Jess Lilley, said: 'I am outraged. They make so much from the show here even though it is produced by Americans.'   

Even shoppers interested in buying small figurines like Daenerys Targaryen (left as doll; right in show) have to fork out £4.62 more in the UK - an increase of  25 per cent from its £13.37 U.S. price tag

It comes after the fifth series of the HBO show premiered in London on Wednesday. 

The American fantasy drama - also shown on Sky in Britain - has attracted record viewers for the channel and created a lucrative opportunity for merchandise.

Top-end products, sold on HBO's U.S. site, include a life-size replica of the Iron Throne for $30,000 (around £20,000).

Successive British governments have complained about global firms consistently charging British consumers more.

Last year a Which? consumer survey found the price difference was particularly prevalent when it came to technology.

Amazon Prime was more than £20 cheaper in the US at £59, its survey found. 

And a 13-inch Apple Macbook Pro cost £1,144 instead of £1,499 in the UK, it said. 

Part of the price difference is due to the UK having a high VAT rate.

A HBO spokesman said: 'The majority of our licensees are outside Europe which creates additional layers of distribution and importation costs.'
