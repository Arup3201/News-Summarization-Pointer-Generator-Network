Buzz Aldrin called for the United States to concentrate on colonising Mars instead of its asteroid program

Buzz Aldrin has called for the United States to start colonizing Mars.

The second man to walk on the moon said Nasa should abandon a plan to bring an asteroid into lunar orbit and concentrate on the Red Planet, calling progress since his 1969 mission 'slow'.

Speaking at a space conference in Washington DC, Aldrin said: 'If we were moving outward from there and an asteroid is a good stopping point, then fine.

'But now it's turned into a whole planetary defense exercise at the cost of our outward exploration.'

The current plan would see a Nasa robotic mission 'capture' an asteroid and bring it back to the moon's orbit in the early 2020s.

Then a team of astronauts would fly to the asteroid to take samples and run tests.

Nasa's Curiosity Rover is currently exploring Mars, sending back pictures from the surface and collecting samples.

Aldrin, who was the lunar module pilot on Apollo 11, called for Nasa to 'commit to permanence on Mars', reports US News.

'We'd become a two-planet species,' he said.

'In Mars, we've been given a wonderful set of moons [...] where we can send continuous numbers of people.'

He agrees with Nasa and the Obama administration that the US should establish a settlement on Mars by 2030 to 2040, saying: 'The United States will be a beacon for the development of humanity,' reports AFP.

The one-way trips should begin with 
three people landing on the planet's moon Phobos, spending 18 months 
overseeing the robotic deployment of a base, he suggested.

Aldrin, promoting his book Mission to Mars: My Vision for Space Exploration, says Nasa should have spacecraft on a cycle to and from the planet, sending more and more humans to expand the colony.

Nasa administrator Charles Bolden told the conference at George Washington University that the asteroid plan was a step towards a Mars mission.

He said that Mars was 'the ultimate destination in our solar system and a priority for NASA' while the asteroid exploration was 'critical for future Mars journeys'.

Aldrin and Neil Armstrong became the first humans to walk on the moon on July 20, 1969.

'It's been 44 years since we stepped on the lunar surface, and I think the progress since then is a little slow,' he said.Â 

'I want the next generation to feel as we did back when I was privileged enough to be a part of Apollo program.'
