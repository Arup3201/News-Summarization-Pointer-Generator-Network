Women go on more diets than men but give up four weeks sooner, according to research.

The average diet for women lasts only 12 days before they give into temptation, while men persevere for around six weeks.

The majority of women have dieted at some point in their lives, with nearly three quarters admitting they had adopted a constructed eating plan and weight loss strategy, compared to just over half of men.

The study, by online pharmacy UKMedix.com, also found that women go on more diets than men.

The poll suggested that women are prolific dieters, trying an average of 17 during their lifetime, while men attempted just five.

Essex was revealed as the UK’s top dieting location for women, according to the research, while Newcastle was the top location for male dieters.

Experts said that these two areas may have come out on top because of influence from reality television shows based there.

The Only Way is Essex popularised the mantra ‘No carbs before Marbs’, as many of its stars went on strict low carbohydrate diets before holidays to Marbella in Spain.

Reality show Geordie Shore based in Newcastle upon Tyne is famous for its cast of sculpted males.

Brighton and London were the next two most common locations for female dieters among the respondents and men from Cardiff and Glasgow were also keen dieters.

1. Essex – 24%

2. Brighton – 15%

3. London – 13%

4. Manchester – 11%

5. Sheffield – 9%

1. Newcastle – 31%

2. Cardiff – 19%

3. Glasgow – 14%

4. Leeds – 12%

5. London – 8%

Sarah Bailey from UKMedix.com said: ‘The results showed that women tend to stick to their diets for an average of 12 days, whilst men tend to stick at them for much longer.

‘It would seem that women are more likely to give in to their cravings.

‘A lot of men treat fitness regimes as a chance to socialise, such as trips to the gym with friends.

‘They encourage each other to stay motivated and turn it into a competition.

‘Many women dream of the perfect body, so put themselves through strenuous dieting, only to realise they’re happier eating and drinking what they want and not being too strict on themselves.

‘Essex has gained a bit of a reputation in recent years as a glamorous and appearance-centred hot spot, so it’s no surprise that they are the UK’s top diet spot for women.

‘It’s also interesting that men from Newcastle are the UK’s biggest dieters, showing that maybe the high profile reality TV shows set in both has an impact on the residents.‘

The survey quizzed 2,841 men and women from across Britain between the ages 18 and 55.
