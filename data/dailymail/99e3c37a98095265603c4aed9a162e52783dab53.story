'People admire them and we’ve had so many compliments over the years but I never thought some jealous individual would steal them from us.

Mr Brana said: 'The police sent a community support officer to interview us - that was the last we heard.

'I’m upset because it’s not a teenage prank, we are clearly being targeted by this woman.'

South Wales Police said they are investigating and examining the video footage.
