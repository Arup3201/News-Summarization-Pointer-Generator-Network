Three women in their seventies who look decades younger have offered up their top tips for staying youthful at any age.

Mimi, 75, Annette, 72, and 71-year-old Linda appeared on the Steve Harvey show yesterday, where audience members guessed that they were in their forties and fifties. Unsurprisingly, jaws dropped when their actual ages were revealed.

Among their tips for maintaining a youthful appearance are getting sunshine, exercising every day, getting beauty sleep and periodically doing juice cleanses.

Mimi, whose long, flowing blonde hair makes her look even younger, credits her raw vegan diet for helping her maintain her fabulous skin and figure.

Having been a vegetarian for 40 years, the San Diego-based author converted to veganism six years ago and says the change eliminated her bad arthritis.

Her favorite raw vegan treat is a chocolate cardamom truffle made with cashew butter and cacao butter, which is high in magnesium and minerals.

What's more, the 75-year-old - whom audience members guessed was only 55 - does yoga four times a week, makes sure to get her beauty sleep, never overeats, 'laugh[s] as much as [she] can' and sometimes does a juice cleanse.

For 71-year-old Linda - who looks only 42, according to the audience - exercise has been the most important part of defying age. 'I do cardio just about every day,' she told the talk show host. 'Whether it's riding a bike or walking on a treadmill or elliptical.'

She even proves her impressive strength on the episode by lifting a 100lb dumbbell with a single arm - all while wearing a leopard print minidress.

Like Linda, 72-year-old Annette also believes in the health benefits of juicing, and she sometimes goes weeks without consuming solid food.

Mindful living: She stays teetotal, maintains a 'positive attitude' and gets eight miles of physical activity daily by walking everywhere and climbing up stairs

She says juicing, which she has done periodically for 45 years, gives her digestive system a rest and lets her absorb all the nutrients in fruits and vegetables, thereby upping her energy level.

Her favorite juice recipe consists of four carrots, two apples and two red peppers, making for a concoction high in vitamin B. She follows up the juice with a shot of homegrown wheatgrass.

Annette also stays teetotal, maintains a 'positive attitude' and gets eight miles of physical activity daily by walking everywhere and climbing up stairs.

The fresh-faced Miami native, whom Steve Harvey viewers thought was just 49, also advises: 'Get enough sunshine when you can.'
