Police have located a talented photographer after being impressed by the images found on a lost USB.

Officers from Melbourne North Police Station appealed for the owner of the mysterious USB stick to come forward after the lost USB was handed in on Wednesday morning.

They described it as 'containing stunning photographs' of India and a young man.

Sargent Steve Ridd told Daily Mail Australia that police didn't regularly treat seemingly mundane lost and found items with such high regard, however the USB stick appeared to be an item of high value.

'We've had a look at it and it contains a file called "exhibition". That's why we thought it needed to get back to the owner as soon as possible,' he said. 

One of the unique images shows a man rowing across a murky river, with an Indian city alight behind him – the colours reflecting across the water. 

Another, taken from behind a group of women walking amongst what appears to be street markets, celebrates the bright, colourful and distinctive head scarves worn by each person.

The third image released by police, shows a stark red heart-shaped balloon amidst a silhouetted group of people while the final image displays a close-up of an unknown young boy.

The USB was found at about 10.30am Elizabeth Street near the Ford dealership in North Melbourne on Wednesday before it was promptly handed in to police.

'Officers have made numerous enquiries to try and locate the owner but have so far been unsuccessful,' a statement from the station said.

Social media users have been split in opinion about the effort being made to locate the USB's owner, with some people suggesting police have nothing better to do with their time while others praise the public service.

Many other joked that had their own USB's been found, police would not be able to share the photographs it contained with the public.
