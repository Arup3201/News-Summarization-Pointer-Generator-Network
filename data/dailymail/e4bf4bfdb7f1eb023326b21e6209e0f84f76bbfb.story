Tragic: Sean Turner, aged three, on holiday in Spain, in August 2011, just before his fourth birthday

A senior nurse in charge of a 'shambolic' ward has admitted she cannot remember any events before a young boy almost died from a heart attack.

Sue Connor, who works at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, also told an inquest into the death of four-year-old Sean Turner she did not know whether she removed a tube administering fluid to the four-year-old.

The tube had become infected so it was removed and replaced but he died a month later from a brain haemorrhage.

His parents allege that the poor standard of nursing on the ward 'contributed to his death'.

Sean
 suffered the heart attack shortly after the line - which had become 
infected - was removed and replaced.

Mrs Connor said she believes colleagues who say she was there, but Sean's parents Steve, 47 and Yolanda, 45, claim she was not.

Hospital protocol states that two nurses must carry out the procedure while the patient is lying down.

But
 according to Mr and Mrs Turner, from Warminster, Wiltshire, Sean was 
sitting in his father's lap while the procedure carried out.

Yesterday
 the inquest heard that during his time on Ward 32 Sean had become so 
dehydrated that he sucked on wet wipes for the moisture.

It
 was also claimed that doctors missed a series of warning signs, 
including continuous vomiting, a high loss of fluid, huge blood clots 
and high blood pressure.

Hopeful: Sean, from Warminster, in Wiltshire, excitedly told friends that doctors were going to 'mend his heart'

Care: Sean, shown here on holiday in Spain, died in part due to poor nursing, according to his parents

Speaking to the inquest about the removal of the line, Mrs Conner said:'I can’t recall anything from that so I don’t know if I was involved in the removal of the line of not.

'But if someone says I was involved then I believe them.

'I
 don’t think I could forget and I don’t think I could remember because I
 take out quite a few of those lines during the course of my work.'

Condition: Sean suffered from heart complications after being born with the organ in the wrong side of his chest

When
 it became infected on February 16 doctors made the decision to remove 
and replace the line - but just 15 minutes later Sean suffered a heart 
attack.

Dehydration: His parents say that at one point Sean was sucking on tissues meant to cool his head in order to rehydrate himself

Mr Turner shook his head in disbelief as Mrs Conner insisted she was present at the removal - something he denies.

'I cannot recall being involved in the removal on the femoral line but I cannot say I was not either,' she said.

'I
 cannot recollect at all what happened. A femoral line can be taken out 
by just one nurse but it is usual that there are two people that do it.'

Adam
 Korn, acting for the family, asked Mrs Conner why Mr Turner’s version 
of events was different and why he remembered only one nurse taking out 
the line.

He said: 'If that is right, that would be in breach of protocol... would it not?'

She
 replied: 'You could take a femoral line out in a parent’s lap because 
we don’t know if the child was sat up at times or laid flat at times.'

Diane Barlow, another nurse on the ward, also gave her version of events, in which she admitted failing to create a seal in a chest drain on the first attempt.

She said: 'When changing the chest line I accept I made a mistake, I forgot to put the water in to create a seal and when I clamped it and looked down to check that the seal had been made I noticed the water was not there.'

Mrs
 Barlow also told the court she had assisted by Mrs Conner in removing 
the femoral line, although conceded no notes had been made on Sean’s 
charts to document this.

Grief: Yolanda Turner, 45 and her husband Steve, 47, who spoke yesterday at the inquest

'Dad was distracting Sean and stood next to him, I was holding his legs so he was still while Sue took the line out,' Mrs Barlow added.

The
 inquest also heard from the doctor in charge of Sean, Guido Pieles, who
said he 'did not have time' to supervise the procedure.

Dr Pieles said he had told the nurses to remove the line, but was not there at the time.

'I was not present during the whole of the procedure,' he said.

Remembering: Mr and Mrs Turner hold a photograph of their son in their Wiltshire home

Harrowing: Mr and Mrs Turner gave an account to the inquest of watching their son worsen and die

'I had gone to the nurses' station and I would have come back to check on Sean.

'There
 was clearly a deterioration in Sean’s condition... it was a busy time. I
 had to talk to my colleagues, arrange blood tests and arrange his care.

'I did not have the time to spend in detail at Sean’s bedside.

'My role was to delegate tasks and oversee tasks and to delegate. I would have not been present at the bedside.'

Inquest: Mr and Mrs Turner arriving yesterday at court for the inquest

Sean was born with his heart on the wrong side of his body and blocked arteries between his heart and lungs.

He underwent elective Fontan surgery - designed to help his heart work more efficiently - on January 24, 2012.

He
 was moved out of the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) after just 
18 hours when nurses told his parents his bed was needed and he was passed
between Ward 32 and PICU following other surgery.

Sean died of a brain haemorrhage, after suffering multiple blood clots, on March 15, 2012.

The inquest continues.
