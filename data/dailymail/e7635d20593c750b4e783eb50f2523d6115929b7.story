The bodies of three women who had been stabbed and had their throats cut were found at a home in Fort Worth, Texas, earlier today.

The women - two sisters and an adult daughter - were discovered by the husband of one of the victims when he got home from work after a night shift.

When the husband, James Serrano, called 911 just after 8am he yelled: 'They killed my family.'

The victims were named as Cynthia Serrano, 48, her 21-year-old daughter, April, and 35-year-old sister Cathy de Leon.

All of the women appeared to have died from stab wounds, and their throats had been cut.

Family and friends of the victims gathered outside the single-storey home in Fort Worth on Tuesday, as detectives and forensic experts gathered evidence.

Anthony de Leon, who was Mrs Serrano and Mrs de Leon's brother, was overcome with grief as he said: 'Three innocent women; three innocent women.'

'If there’s anybody, anything they know, please help us ... These three ladies didn’t deserve this,' he told the Fort Worth Star Telegraph.

He said that the women were alive and well when family members checked on them at about 10pm on Monday.

Calling the triple murder a 'mystery', Mr de Leon said their bodies were discovered by Mrs Serrano's husband when he got back from work.

Investigators believe the women were 
attacked at about 6.30am, but they have not released details about 
possible suspects or motives.

'Shortly after 8 o’clock this morning,
 Fort Worth police received a call about a possible homicide on the 500 
block of W. Felix Street.' Sergeant Raymond Bush, of Fort Worth Police, 
told CBS DFW.

'Upon arrival officers found multiple deceased persons inside the residence.'

Rosa Guerrero, whose aunt, Cynthia, was one of the victims, said: 'No one was expecting for this to happen to them.'

She described her aunt as religious, and said she always attended Mass on a Sunday.

The cries of the victims' family alerted neighbors to the tragedy. Lorena Hamilton, who lives a couple of houses away, said she heard police sirens and then a woman screaming.

'As I walked out here, I saw this woman screaming and crying, down on her knees,' Ms Hamilton said. 'She told me, "They killed her family".'

Investigation: Police tape is used to block off the street around the home where the three victims were found

Mrs Serrano's husband, who alerted police to the murder, is being questioned by police, a family member told AP.

Sergeant Bush told MailOnline was unable to confirm the nature of the injuries, or whether anyone was being questioned in the case.

He said: 'Homicide has taken lead in the investigation, and there are no new details.'

Sergeant Bush added that Tarrant County medical examiner's officer was expected to release details about the cause of death in the coming days.
