Sam Allardyce wants to do Liverpool a favour and wreck Manchester City's title party.

City need just one point against the Hammers to seal a second Premier League trophy in two years.

Manuel Pellegrini's side beat Aston Villa 4-0 on Wednesday night to capitalise on second-placed Liverpool allowing a 3-0 lead to slip at Crystal Palace to draw 3-3.

But while Allardyce recogises the lethal threat City face, he points out that his Hammers side can play with complete freedom.

'We all know Manchester City in full cry are very difficult to play against and we've got to go out there and give a fantastic effort to try to stop them grasping the title on that day,' he said.

'It will be hugely difficult: they're the best team at home in the league. Their goal record is fantastic and they've got great players.

'But every (West Ham) player can go and give his best because we know we're safe in the Premier League, so let's go and spoil Manchester City's party.'

The under-fire Hammers boss also wants to win to see Liverpool clinch a first title in 24 years, should they win their match against Newcastle.

He also revealed that he would like to see Anfield talisman Steven Gerrard lift the one trophy which has eluded him.

He said: 'I think at this moment in time, from a neutral's point of view, I think everybody would like to see Liverpool win it. From a personal point of view I'd like to see Steven Gerrard win it.

'It's the last thing he hasn't quite 
achieved for Liverpool, but obviously they've let it slip out of their 
hands. On form and where they are, Man City are the favourites.

'Huge
 credit to Manuel Pellegrini. It's his first season and if he does win the 
Premier League and the Capital One Cup means they've done the double.

'There's not much more you can ask from a manager, no matter how much 
money has been spent. Everyone knows this league is the hardest league 
to win in the world.'
