Gareth Bale has told Real Madrid fans they have still not seen the best of him as he looks to build on a fairytale first season at the Spanish giants.

Bale may have struggled with form and fitness on occasion following his world-record move from Tottenham last summer, but overall he will be delighted with how things have gone so far at the Bernabeu.

The Wales international scored 22 goals and claimed 11 assists in 44 matches for Madrid, including netting a stunning winner in the Copa del Rey final victory over Barcelona and a crucial goal in the Champions League final win against Atletico Madrid.

Impressive though those statistics are, Bale is already looking to do better next season.

He said in AS: 'I hope to improve those figures. I want more and more. I work hard to give my best for Madrid.

'I feel that I can improve more and I hope to continue getting better. I'm still young and I have room to improve in the future.'

Bale helped Madrid win two of the three major trophies they were competing for this season, with only the Primera Division title eluding them as they finished three points behind arch rivals Atletico Madrid.

The 24-year-old is now hoping his side can clinch all three titles next term, saying: '(I want) each and every trophy. Especially the league, which I still don't have.

'I'm also motivated to win the Champions League and the Copa del Rey again. The team will be even more competitive and could win everything.

'We want to be the first team to retain the Champions League. That is a motivation.'
