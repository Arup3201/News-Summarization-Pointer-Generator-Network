Radioactive material was found in the luggage of a passenger bound for Iran - at Moscow's Sheremetyevo international airport.

Russia's Federal Customs Service 'recently' found 18 pieces of radioactive metal packed in individual steel casing recently after the material triggered an alarm in the airport's radiation control system.

It comes as tension rises between Western powers and Iran after a UN nuclear watchdog report last month said it appeared to have worked on designing a nuclear weapon.

Discovery: Radioactive material found in the luggage of a passenger bound for Tehran was seized at Moscow's Sheremetyevo international airport

Tests showed the material found in the bag was a radioactive isotope which could be obtained only 'as a result of a nuclear reactor's operations'.

Radiation levels in the area were 20 times above normal. An airport customs spokesman said the material had been identified as sodium-22, which can be used in medical equipment, but gave no other details.

Sergei Novikov, spokesman for Rosatom nuclear agency, said the pieces were highly unlikely to have come from them.

And he said, contrary to the customs' service claim, the isotope was produced by particle accelerators, not by nuclear reactors.

Universities, research institutes and big medical centres can have the technology to produce it in Russia, he said.

And he also claimed Rosatom had never sold sodium-22 to Iran, but it had supplied it with other types of medical isotopes.

Claims: Iran, whose president is Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, denies Western allegations it is seeking to build nuclear weapons

Research director Lars-Erik De Geer, of the Swedish Defence Research Institute, added: 'There is no weapons aspect to this (material).'

The objects were sent to a Moscow prosecutor's office that deals with air and water transport, the service said in a statement.

Authorities have opened a criminal investigation, but the Iranian was not detained.

Spokeswoman Kseniya Grebenkina said the luggage had been seized some time ago, but could not specify when.

The announcement of the discovery came two days after the U.S. House of Representatives endorsed harsher sanctions against Iran aimed at derailing its suspected pursuit of nuclear weapons.

Iran denies Western allegations that it is seeking to build nuclear weapons.

Earlier this year, Atomstroiexport, a Rosatom subsidiary, launched Iran's first nuclear reactor in Bushehr.

Russian officials have insisted the deal with Iran is in line with international agreements and will oblige Tehran to ship all the spent fuel from the plant back to Russia for reprocessing to avoid a possibility of it being used in a covert weapons program.
