His beanie hat may be slightly askew but Joleon Lescott is talking straight. For the first time since leaving Manchester City last summer he opens up about his disappointment at the manner in which his successful five-year spell ended.

Lescott is still confused by decisions made by Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini to omit him from their line-ups, most crushingly from last season's Capital One Cup final, and how a lack of action hampered his chance of cementing an England place.

This is not to suggest he is gloomy. Chatting after training with West Bromwich Albion he is quite the opposite. Lescott is back playing regularly and enjoying the responsibility that comes from being an experienced figure in a side of humbler aspirations.

The defender began to grow accustomed to being sidelined towards the end of his Manchester City career

He has not given up that desire to play for his country again, either. 'I still feel I could have played more games last season but it wasn't to be,' he says. 'My decision was to go somewhere I could play more regularly and since I have been fit I have done that.'

The omens are good for West Brom’s Joleon Lescott on Monday night. It’s almost exactly three years to the day since the defender was in Manchester City’s team as they thrashed local rivals United 6-1 at Old Trafford. Lescott even set up a goal for Edin Dzeko.

Knee and calf niggles prohibited his involvement at the start of this campaign but he has been a source of strength in Alan Irvine's team for the past three games.

Manchester United provide the opposition on Monday and the prospect of facing Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria is enough to have any defender checking whether the hamstrings feel a bit tight.

Not Lescott. He relishes a duel with such adversaries. He was, after all, in the City side that won 6-1 at Old Trafford three years ago this week. Later that season he was also in the defence that secured a 1-0 win over United which had even greater significance.

If Lescott continues to play well in the lead up to the next England match he is confident he will get a call-up

A fortnight later Lescott lifted the Premier League trophy, having played 31 Premier League matches. He held the trophy again in May but this time after only 10 league appearances. 'I got a medal,' he says. 'It was still really enjoyable, it just didn't feel the same.' It is notable that Lescott's greater frustration came from being left out for the Capital One Cup final. 'I played every minute, captained the semi-final, then not playing (in the final) was the hardest part.'

Pellegrini did not explain why Martin Demichelis would be starting instead. 'He just read out the team and my name wasn't there', Lescott remembers. 'We won and then he explained why he didn't pick Joe (Hart). It was because Pantsy (Costel Pantilimon) had played more minutes. I was like, 'If that's the reason for him, why isn't that a reason for me?'

That bewilderment can be traced back to the summer after City won their first Premier League title. Lescott played every minute of England's Euro 2012 campaign, scoring against France, but returned to find Mancini questioning his mentality. 'I heard an interview with Roberto Mancini saying I had lost confidence,' recalls Lescott. 'I thought that was strange because we had won the league, I had gone to the Euros, scored, and I didn't think my confidence could get any higher.'

The former Manchester City defender has played against some of the best strikers in the world 

He went on to play 33 times that season but more frequently from the bench. Pellegrini took over and his trust in Demichelis, despite the Argentine's initial struggles, pushed Lescott further to the sidelines. 'A manager has no allegiance to a player they haven't bought,' says Lescott. 'They think, 'He's from the old team. If I don't pick him, he's not going to be seen as my mistake'.'

When it came to moving on, Lescott liked speaking to Hull City manager Steve Bruce but chose Irvine, with whom he worked at Everton. There was no £22million fee this time but there was pressure to perform nonetheless. 'When I was injured I was gutted for him (Irvine),' says Lescott. 'He said, 'Take your time. I don't want you 80 per cent fit sitting on the bench.' That was a weight off my shoulders. Now we're showing what he's been working on in training.'

Victories over Tottenham and Burnley preceded a narrow defeat at Liverpool. Lescott believes, at 32, he could get back into the England reckoning if this promising start grows. He was on the bench for a friendly in Brazil last year but has not been in Roy Hodgson's squad since.

The 32-year-old has won 26 caps for England since his debut in a 3-0 win against Estonia in October 2007 

Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka have been a regular partnership in Roy Hodgson's England selections

'After the Euros I got the feeling (Gary) Cahill was going to be the next focal point and it was an opportunity for someone to play alongside him. I felt it was mine to stake a claim but it was stop-start at City. I've only played three games this season (so) for me to say I should be back in the squad would be disrespectful. If I continue to play the same level up to the next international then hopefully I will be closer.'

Lescott also offers an interesting analysis of United's defensive troubles. 'Centre halves have to play together as a partnership,' he says. 'Van Persie and Falcao can play off the cuff and win the game. As a defender you can't. I can't suddenly just go into midfield and think, 'That was great' because my mate at the back could be being roasted. Once United get that unit playing regularly they will be fine.'

Lescott argues that against United it will be easier to defend because knowing the calibre of the opponent focuses the mind and guards against lapses. 'That side of it will be fun,' he smiles before denying that a repeat of Leicester City's 5-3 victory would be satisfactory — 'Even if we win, I wouldn't be happy conceding three.'
