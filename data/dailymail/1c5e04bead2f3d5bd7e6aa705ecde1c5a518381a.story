Families could be forced to recycle yet more of their rubbish under tough new waste directives proposed yesterday by Brussels.

Households are already forced to separate rubbish into various coloured bins, boxes and buckets as Britain attempts to hit a European target of recycling half our waste by 2020.

But the European Commission now wants us to recycle at least 70 per cent of municipal waste – most of which comes from homes – by 2030.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has called weekly bin collections a 'funadamental right' - because it stops rubbish building up like this in Liverpool

Other targets include recycling 80 per
 cent of packaging by the same year, tighter food waste reduction rules –
 and a ban by 2025 on sending anything to landfill that can be recycled.

The
 stricter targets could force councils to adopt more coercive methods to
 force households to recycle more, such as pay-as-you-throw bin taxes or
 fines for people who fail to sort their rubbish properly. Britain is 
currently struggling to hit the 50 per cent target by 2020, let alone 
the  proposed stricter ones.

In
 the 12 months to September last year England’s household recycling rate
 actually fell from 44.1 per cent to 43.9 per cent, and councils are 
already under pressure to bring in more ambitious compulsory recycling 
methods next year to get the figures up.

Communities
 Secretary Eric Pickles yesterday pledged to fight the new proposals. He
 said: ‘Hard-working families pay a lot of money in council tax and they
 deserve a proper rubbish and recycling collection in return.’

The
 Commission claims a so-called ‘circular economy’ with more recycling 
will boost the European economy and create 580,000 new jobs.

It
 said: ‘Keeping materials in productive use for longer, re-using them, 
and with improved efficiency, would also improve EU competitiveness on 
the  global stage.’

Rubbish 
recycling has been politically sensitive in Britain for the past decade 
after it became clear that Labour’s drive to increase recycling was 
unpopular.

Eric Pickles is considering making it a legal requirement for councils to collect black bin bags every week

Fortnighty rubbish collections, now used across more than half the country, proved vote losers in local elections.

The
 Coalition abandoned plans for taxes and fines for families who break 
strict wheelie bin rules and Mr Pickles pressed councils to bring back 
weekly collections.

The 
Communities Secretary added yesterday: ‘This Government has scrapped 
Labour’s bin bully approach – and we will fight attempts to re-impose 
bureaucracy via the back door of Europe.’ Environment department Defra 
also said Brussels had underestimated the costs, while Lib Dem 
Environment Minister Dan  Rogerson said the new target was out of reach.

The
 plans meant ‘putting more energy into chasing a principle without 
getting much back’, he told MPs at the Commons environmental audit 
committee.

The Local 
Government Association, which represents councils, said the Brussels 
scheme would be hugely expensive for local authorities – which have 
already more than doubled spending on waste and recycling since 2000.

Eurosceptic
 Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘The European Commission is recycling 
the same old policies put forward by the same technocrats.’

The
 most recent figures from EU statistics branch Eurostat reveal that 
Germany is the continent’s top recycler on 65 per cent. Britain is on 
43.9 per cent, while France recycles just 39 per cent. Romania recycles 
one per cent of its household waste.
