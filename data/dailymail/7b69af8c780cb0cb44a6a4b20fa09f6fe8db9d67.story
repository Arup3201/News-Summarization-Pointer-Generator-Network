Taxpayers may have to cover a multimillion-pound shortfall in compensation to victims of Jimmy Savile.

His £3.3million estate will be used by authorities to meet claims by hundreds of people who suffered his vile abuse, but any excess compensation will be funded by taxpayers.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said yesterday that the rogue DJ and TV presenter was a sickening sex abuser who ‘exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes’.

A High Court ruling earlier this year said victims could make claims of 
up to £60,000 from the estate, the NHS or the BBC, where Savile abused 
children in dressing rooms. Mr Hunt confirmed that compensation claims 
linked to NHS hospitals will be met by the public purse.

More than 500 victims have been identified by Scotland Yard and the 
NSPCC, meaning the total cost of claims could run into tens of millions 
of pounds.

In addition, many are represented by specialist lawyers who have run up 
substantial legal costs over the past 20 months.

In the 
Commons yesterday, Labour’s shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: 
‘Given what has been revealed, shouldn’t the government now consider 
allocating public finances to ensure all people damaged by Savile are 
properly supported and compensated.’

In
 response, Mr Hunt said: ‘The government will underwrite this so if 
there are any claims that are not able to be met by the estate we will 
finance that from the public purse.

‘But we do think the estate is the first place to start, for obvious reasons.’

Abuse: Jimmy Savile was given open access to hospitals all over Britain where he attacked hundreds of children, even when he was 82 and even took glass eyes from the dead and abused their bodies

Investigators discovered Savile had at least 60 victims at the Leeds hospital aged between five and 75

Savile investigators spoke to 60 people who gave accounts of their experiences at the hospital 33 of these people were hospital patients and 19 were hospital staff - all female

First case of abuse was reported in 1962 when Savile was 36. The most recent victim was in 2009 when he was aged 82

Forty three of the reported encounters took place in public areas such as wards, corridors and offices

Incidents ranged from lewd remarks and inappropriate touching to sexual assault and, in three cases, rape.

Nine victims told a member of staff about what happened - but none were reported to senior managers

Leeds probe interviewed more than 200 people and reviewed more than 1,300 documents over 50 years

He added it was not possible to bring in laws to stop ‘all criminal, 
vile activity’, with the Disclosure and Barring Service, formerly 
Criminal Records Bureau relying on a culture that ensures the public and
 patients feel able to speak out and are listened to.

Savile amassed his wealth during six decades of fame as a TV presenter, 
DJ and charity fundraiser. His estate was frozen following revelations 
about his activities as a predatory paedophile and sex attacker.

He
 died in October 2011, aged 84, before detailed claims of abuse against 
him were properly made public, despite rumours about his behaviour.

In April, the High Court ordered that adverts be published advising victims of Savile that they could claim compensation.

They were put in two national newspapers as well as on the Channel 
Islands, which he often visited. The claims scheme will stay open for a 
year.

Mr Hunt told a stunned House of Commons how ‘time and again’ victims were ignored because Savile was seen as a ‘somewhat eccentric national treasure.

In reality he was a sickening sex abuser who ‘exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes’,

Details of the later DJ’s reign of terror in NHS hospitals across the country were revealed in 28 reports released today.

The investigations discovered at least 60 victims aged between five and 75 at 28 institutions including Leeds, Broadmoor and Stoke Mandeville hospital.

Savile boasted about having sex with corpses and had jewellery made from glass eyes he removed from their bodies.

Mr Hunt said some of the accounts revealed in the ‘litany’ of abuse were ‘too horrific’ to repeat in the House of Commons.

Mr Hunt told MPs: ‘Today’s reports will shake this House and our country to the core.

‘Savile was a callous, opportunistic, wicked predator who abused and raped individuals, many of them patients and young people, who expected and had a right to expect to be safe. His actions span five decades – from the 1960s to 2010.

‘The family favourite loved by millions courted popularity and used it to perpetrate and cover up his own evil acts.’

During five decades of abuse, Savile used his celebrity to gain access to patients on wards and ‘inexplicably’ was even allowed to watch female patients stripped naked for bathing, Mr Hunt said.

‘As a nation at that time we held Savile in our affection as a somewhat eccentric national treasure with a strong commitment to charitable causes. ‘Today’s reports show that in reality he was a sickening and prolific sexual abuser who repeatedly exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes.’

Savile's victims at Leeds General Infirmary (LGI) ranged from five-years-old to pensioners and included men, women, boys and girls - including some who were dead Read more:

Even
 when victims did speak out, they were ignored by staff who either did 
not believe them or were afraid of the power Savile was able to wield.

Mr
 Hunt went on: ‘The systems in place to protect people were either too 
weak or were ignored. People and institutions turned a blind eye.

‘So
 today I want to apologise on behalf of the Government and the NHS to 
all the victims who were abused by Savile in NHS-run institutions.

‘We let them down badly and however long ago it may have been, many of them are still reliving the pain they went through.’

He
 urged MPs to remember Savile’s victims: ‘They were brave. They have 
been vindicated. Savile was a coward. He has been disgraced.

‘The system failed to prevent him from abusing. It failed to act when people spoke up. We must not allow this to happen again.’

Mr Hunt announced he was writing to every NHS leader in the country telling them to review their safeguarding arrangements ‘to ensure they are confident about patient safety’.

He stressed that the law has been toughened since Savile prowled the corridors of hospitals but the NHS still has ‘a long way to go’.

However, Mr Hunt insisted rules on protecting patients ‘must not hinder the extraordinary contribution’ of thousands of volunteers and fundraisers working in the NHS every day.

‘They are the opposite of Savile and we need to ensure their remarkable contribution is sustained,’ he added.
