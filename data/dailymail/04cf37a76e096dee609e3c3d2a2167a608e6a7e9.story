Two young boys who fell from an inflatable bounce house as it was swept skyward by gusty winds remained hospitalized in stable condition Wednesday, one in a medically induced coma with a head injury, according to police.

A girl, age 10, and the boys, ages 5 and 6, were playing in the 10-by-10-foot roofless nylon playhouse at a South Glens Falls, New York, townhouse community Monday afternoon when the 38-pound Little Tikes toy product broke loose from plastic anchoring stakes, local police said.

Commercial bounce houses rented for parties and other events are made of heavy vinyl, weigh 200 to 250 pounds and are secured by 18-inch steel stakes.

Dangerous: This May 13, 2014 photo provided by the South Glens Fall Police Department, shows a deflated bounce house that three children were playing in on Monday when it broke loose from plastic anchoring stakes and was swept skyward by gusty winds

The girl fell out immediately and suffered minor scrapes, but the boys didn't tumble out until the toy was 15 feet in the air.

Police Chief Kevin Judd told the Glens Falls Post Star that one boy hit a parked car and then the pavement as he fell and suffered a serious head injury.

The other suffered two broken arms, a broken jaw, broken facial orbital bone and possible ruptured spleen. The boys, who live in neighboring apartments nearby wher ethe incident happened, were airlifted to Albany Medical Center.

The chief said an investigation was continuing but no charges were likely to be filed. He called what happened a 'tragic accident.'

There have been other accidents involving windblown bounce houses.

In Scottsdale, Arizona, a bounce house outside a McDonald's restaurant was pushed into traffic by a gust of wind in March 2012. No injuries were reported.

Way up: The children had long since fallen out when they shocking photos were taken. The bouncy house flew an estimated 50 high and made it past a stretch of woods before finally drifting back to earth and landing behind a local school

In June 2011, strong winds tumbled 
three bounce houses with children inside them at a youth soccer 
tournament in Oceanside. Minor injuries were reported.

Witnesses
 watched in horror as the inflatable bounce house was swept into the air
 before dumping the boys back on the ground from 15 feet up.

In
 the nightmarish scene, the children were playing in the carnival staple
 when winds spun the bounce house around as if in a tornado before 
lifting it up.

The boys were hospitalized Monday afternoon with serious injuries.

'It was like a horror movie,' complex resident Taylor Seymour told the Post-Star. 'It just kept going up and up. It cleared our building and the trees.'

It was on Seymour's car that one of the children landed.

The structure went on to blow a full 50 feet into the air and one witness snapped a shocking picture of it hovering above.

Dangerous: The structure was similar to the one pictured and was owned by a resident of the apartment complex in South Glens Falls, New York where the incident occurred. A third child, a 10-year-old little girl, manged to escape just as the structure took off and received only minor injuries

The mother of the little girl agreed.

'My older daughters witnessed it and said it was just horrible,' she said, without giving her name. 'A big gust of wind just blew it right off the ground with the kids in it. It's just sickening.'

'The witnesses said it was a sudden burst of wind and it just lifted off the ground,' Patrolman David Gifford told the Post-Star. 'It was just a freak accident.'

Gifford and the little girl's mother said the bounce house was tethered to the ground with stakes but that it was blown loose.

The structure was owned by a resident of the complex. It landed behind a nearby school after clearing a stretch of woods.

The owner told the Post-Star that she'd set up the Little Tikes brand toy several times in the two years she'd owned it.

The mother of the lucky little girl, at least, wasn't not pointing fingers anyway.

'I don't think people know that this can happen when it's windy,' she said.
