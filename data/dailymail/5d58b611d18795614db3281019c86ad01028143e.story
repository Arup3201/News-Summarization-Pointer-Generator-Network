A piglet who suffered a broken pelvis when his mother fell on him has been given a custom-built cart to help him get around while he recovers.

Little Leon Trotsky was just two weeks old when his mother toppled on top of him, shattering his pelvis and breaking and dislocating his femur.

A kindly soul took the injured animal to Edgar's Mission, a non-profit Farm Sanctuary in Kilmore, Australia where, despite his injuries, Leon has gone from 
strength to strength thanks to the care he has received.

But working with tiny bones and fragile piglets is never easy and Leon proved way too small for the tiniest of carts that would have 
otherwise taken the pressure off his compromised limbs.

However, staff at the sanctuary refused to give up and built a special cart to take the strain off Leon's limbs as they mend.
