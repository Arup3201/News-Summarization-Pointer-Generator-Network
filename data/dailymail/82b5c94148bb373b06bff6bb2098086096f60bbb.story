A man wielding a machete allegedly attacked a 24-year-old shopper after storming the aisles of a Tesco supermarket in what appeared to be a racially-motivated assault.

Shoppers were forced to flee the store in Mold, Flintshire, yesterday afternoon, when the man entered carrying a machete in one hand and a hammer in the other, according to witnesses.

He was said to be shouting 'white power' before allegedly targeting the victim near the entrance to the shop. The victim suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital.

Police arrested a 25-year-old man on suspicion of attempted murder after the attack and said they are not looking for any other suspects. The suspect, who lives locally, has not been charged.

Police said they hope to release further information later today. 

Witnesses said that a man entered the store shouting 'white power' while carrying a large knife - possibly a machete - in one hand, and what looked like a hammer in the other. 

The store was closed by police yesterday as officers investigated the incident but has since reopened.

Rich Fay, 20, of Eryrys, near Mold, was in the store with his father Dave at 1.40pm yesterday, when the attack took place.

Mr Fay said: 'The incident took place in the aisle immediately in front of the front door.'

'We were in the magazine aisle and heard a loud scream which we thought, given the time, might have been some school kids or something. 

'We hung around for a while and then heard someone shout "white power".

'As we went around the corner, we saw a man with a knife in one hand and something that looked like a hammer in the other that still had the tags on them.

'Then he was being reprimanded by somebody who tried to grab a hold of him. He was dragged out of the store.'

Police occupied the car park and blocked off all entrances to and from the store shortly after the incident.

People were warned not to go near Tesco and the vicinity of the shop was cordoned off.

Mr Fay said: 'It was chaotic. The staff told everyone to get out of the store.

'Everyone was bewildered, quite a few shoppers didn't realise what had gone on, it was surreal.'

Michael Ball, from Mold, was walking past the store at Ponterwyl with his partner as the scenes were unfolding.

He said: 'We spoke to staff and shoppers who said two men were running around the store, one chasing another, with a hammer and a long curved blade.

'Some described it as a machete, one man was heard to be shouting "white power".'

Another witness, who asked not to be named, said: 'We approached the door and everybody was rushing out panicking and we heard a man was in the store with a knife and a hammer and they were trying to calm him down.' 

A police spokesman said: 'North Wales Police and other emergency services responded to the report of a serious assault that had taken place in Tesco's store in Mold, Flintshire.

'A 25-year-old local man was arrested inside the store on suspicion of attempted murder and has been taken to a local police station.

'No one else was injured during the course of the attack but the store has been closed while crime scene investigators secure and gather evidence and officers speak with witnesses.'

DCI Alun Oldfield, of Wrexham CID, who is leading the investigation said from the scene yesterday: 'At 1.40pm this afternoon a 24-year-old man was shopping in the store when he was attacked. 

'As a result the man sustained serious but not life threatening injuries and was conveyed to a local hospital.

'Initial indications are this is a racially motivated attack and as such management of the community impact will feature significantly in order to provide public reassurance.

He added: 'I understand speculation is circulating via social media but this will not help our investigation and is distressing to family and friends of the victim and so I'd ask for due consideration whilst investigators speak with witnesses to ascertain the full circumstances of this incident.

A police van was photographed parked outside the supermarket yesterday as police investigated the scene

'North Wales Police are treating the matter as attempted murder and if you witnessed the attack please contact Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and quote reference S006316.

'Police want to provide reassurance to the public that incidents of this nature are rare in North Wales.'

A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesman confirmed a man with serious injuries was taken to an undisclosed hospital.

A Tesco spokesman confirmed they were assisting police with their inquiries and the store and petrol station would be closed for 'up to 24 hours'.

Delyn MP David Hanson expressed his shock in the aftermath of the attack.

He said: 'The news of the attack on an individual in Mold is truly appalling and my thoughts go with the victim and his family. It is terrible and shocking.'
