Ryanair has dismissed one of its longest-serving pilots for blowing the whistle on alleged safety concerns at the budget airline.

John Goss was sacked with ‘immediate effect’ and the airline issued legal proceedings against him after he appeared in a documentary about its safety policy.

Ryanair said Captain Goss, who was with the firm for 27 years, had been dismissed for ‘gross misconduct’.

Senior Labour MP Barry Sheerman today called for an urgent investigation into safety at the airline in the light of the revelations.

Ryanair yesterday said it was dismissing Mr Goss - an experienced pilot who was due to retire in October – for ‘gross misconduct’.

Last night chairman of the Ryanair Pilot Group Evert van Zwol said: ‘This is a particularly difficult time for John and his family.’

The representative added: ‘We will provide every support possible to enable John to deal with this challenging situation.

‘I am sure you will understand his first priority is to look after his family and to seek legal advice on his options.’

Captain Goss had also recently received a warning from Ryanair after he gave a newspaper interview about safety issues.

And in 2005 he was involved in a High Court case against Ryanair after it tried to bring disciplinary proceedings against him.

The case was later settled and the pilot continued to work for Ryanair up until this week.

The survey featured in Dispatches was organised by an interim council of the Ryanair Pilots Group, which includes KLM, Aer Lingus, Southwest and Air France pilots.

Of 1,000 Ryanair pilots – 94 per cent wanted regulators to conduct an inquiry into the impact of employment practices on safety.

However, the Irish Airline Authority has denied all the allegations in the documentary and the authority says that Ryanair has always complied with safety requirements.

But MPs called on the Civil Aviation Authority to launch an investigation.

Mr Sheerman, the chairman of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety, told MainOnline: 'I have been in touch with the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority and said I want an immediate inquiry into Ryanair’s safety record.

'This is serious stuff. We have got a bit complacent on air safety in this country. We have got to be vigilant.

'What Ryanair appears to be up to isn’t the way to treat staff or safety. It is not right to be sweeping safety under the carpet.’

Although a number of pilots had contributed to the programme, Captain Goss was the only one identified. 

A Ryanair spokesman said the company had been ‘independently confirmed’ as one of the safest airlines in Europe.

‘We will not allow a Ryanair employee to defame our safety on national television just three weeks after he confirmed in writing to Ryanair that he had no concerns with safety,’ the carrier stated.

‘We look forward to correcting Mr Goss’s defamatory claims in court in due course, but will not be commenting further.’

Captain van Zwol said the dismissal shows the ‘hollowness’ of Ryanair’s promise to legally protect the pilots who took part in the Dispatches programme, if those pilots revealed their identities.

‘The very pilot who freely identified himself on the programme, and spoke about the general lack of confidence by pilots in the broader regulatory system, has suffered instant dismissal,’ he said.

The IAA insisted that Ryanair’s fuel policy is in line with EU regulations.

It said: ‘The IAA is disappointed that once again Channel 4 Dispatches has decided to engage in a misguided attack on the regulation of a low-cost carrier, based upon false and misleading information, which may undermine the travelling public’s confidence in civil air transport in Europe.’

Last night Socialist TD Clare Daly called for urgent legislation to protect whistleblowers.
