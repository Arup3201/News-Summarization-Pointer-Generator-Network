European Union migrants could be refused entry to France if their ‘personal behaviour’ is considered a threat to ‘security or public order’.

The vaguely worded measure could be used to stop all kinds of undesirables entering the country, from those with criminal records to communities considered unable to integrate. Critics also believe it could be manipulated to stop almost any foreigner entering France, even those with EU passports.

It comes after the European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, warned Britain that a cap on migrants arriving from neighbouring countries would be illegal.

France’s increasingly reactionary Socialist government has introduced legislation clearly aimed at stopping undesirables, whether Roma gypsies or known eastern European gangsters.

Clauses on new immigration and anti-terrorism measures are aimed at ‘any national of an EU member-state or any member of the family of such an individual’ who is likely to cause trouble.

The proposed legislation reads that all should ‘be banned from entering French territory if their presence would constitute a real, current and sufficiently serious threat’.

It is all aimed at protecting the ‘fundamental interest of society, in terms of public order or security’ against their ‘personal behaviour’.

Despite the EU principle of freedom of movement, Prime Minister Manuel Valls has made it clear that he wants to keep undesirables out.

Mr Valls said he stands by remarks calling for the expulsion of France’s Roma communities, despite the fact that most are from the EU countries of Bulgaria and Romania.

Outgoing European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso warned Britain it would not be able to introduce immigration caps

He said few could ever integrate into French society and ‘the majority’ should be ‘sent back to the borders’ because of their association with crimes ranging from robbery to muggings and aggressive begging.

France has move increasingly to the far right this year, with the anti-immigration and anti-EU National Front party riding high in opinion polls.

Meanwhile, Mr Valls has been criticised by human rights campaigners, the European Commission and and left-wing cabinet colleagues.

Similar groups have attacked the new legal measures, one of which was approved as a clause as part of an anti-terrorism bill in the Senate last week.

The EU executive has not yet commented on the proposed French laws, but human rights groups say it will be used to keep legitimate immigrants out.

A spokesman for the Paris-based Immigrants' Information and Support Group said:

‘We are particularly worried about the possible use of this measure against Roma from Romania and Bulgaria.’

The broad definition of terms such as ‘security threat’ and ‘personal behaviour’ could all be used to refuse entry, such groups believe.

But a spokesman for the Interior Ministry in Paris said that each case would be considered ‘on its own merits’, and the legislation was ‘by no means’ aimed at specific EU communities like the Roma.

Amnesty International are among groups who have called for a ban on forced evictions which saw more than 10,000 Roma evicted from temporary camps in the first half of this year.

Their caravans and illegal shelters are regularly razed to the ground, with Mr Valls saying : ‘The majority of Roma should be delivered back to the borders. We are not here to welcome these people…It's not France's job to deal with the misery of the whole world.’

Last week, EC president Mr Barrosa said David Cameron’s attempt to control EU migration was doomed to failure because freedom of movement is ‘an essential principle’.
