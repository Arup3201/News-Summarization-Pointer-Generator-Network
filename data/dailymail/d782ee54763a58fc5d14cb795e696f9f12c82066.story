Two 13-year-old cousins have died after jumping into New York City's Bronx River on Friday to cool off during a 79-degree day.

Wellington Gavin and Erickson Villa left school Friday afternoon to play in Starlight Park when the tragic accident happened.

Villa was allegedly the first to jump in, and didn't know how to swim. His cousin jumped after to help him, but struggled in the currents as well.

Emergency responders arrived on the scene around 3:14pm, at which point the boys had been in the water for roughly 30 minutes.

One boy was removed at 3:37pm, followed by the other nearly an hour later.

Both were unconscious when they were pulled from the water. Villa died that day while Gavin initially improved at Children's Center Montefiore Hospital.

However, by Sunday his conditioned worsened so much that his mother was preparing to take him off life support.

Gavin's heart stopped on its own before life support was taken away.

Gavin's family have been speaking to the public through their church pastor, Rev Joel Bauza.

On Sunday, Rev Bauza announced Gavin's untimely passing and said they his family had decided to donate his organs to science as a tribute to his 'act of heroism'.

Rev Bauza also said the family hopes top protect other children from falling prey to the river.

While there are signs showing that swimming is prohibited in that part of the park, new boat docks have become a favorite gathering spot of the neighborhood's children.

'The family has a lot of concerns about the park safety and they want to address that,' Rev Bauza said.

The family of the two young men are currently fundraising to send Gavin and Villa's bodies back to their native Dominican Republic.
