Mario Balotelli didn't just have the eyes of a nation on him, as his fiancee Fanny Neguesha was also in the crowd for Italy's World Cup Group D opener against England.

The Belgian beauty was spotted in Manaus' Arena Amazonia wearing an Azzurri shirt with Balotelli's name and number.

Neguesha would have been all smiles as Balotelli scored in the match with an early second-half header to give Italy a 2-1 lead.

On Monday,
 23-year-old AC Milan forward Balotelli took to his Instagram account to
 reveal their engagement with the caption: 'She said yes.. The most 
important yes in my life. That was the place of my question! I Love you 
and happy birthday too! Je t'aime my WIFE'.

Despite
 the fact Belgium are also in this summer's showpiece it seems clear 
that Neguesha will be hoping her fiancee can help Italy win a fifth 
World Cup.

Balotelli
 started upfront in a lone role for the Italians as coach Cesare 
Prandelli was forced to alter his tactics just hours before kick-off 
with news that captain Gianluigi Buffon wasn't fit to start.

The 36-year-old Juventus keeper's World Cup could be over before it begins after he suffered a twisted ankle in training.

Buffon in a race to be fit to for Italy's final Group D game against 
Uruguay on June 24.
