The mother of a young girl who was allegedly assaulted by two young women last month said footage of the wild brawl made her cry.

Two young women will face a children's court tomorrow after disturbing video of the alleged incident, which occurred on the NSW Central Coast, went viral late last month.

In the footage, the blonde victim, 15, is seen being dragged to the ground and repeatedly kicked and punched as a man is heard egging them on. 

'Honestly, I just I cried,' the devastated mother told Daily Mail Australia on Monday. 'I never imagined having to see my daughter go through that brutality.'

'It was horrifying, it was devastating.'

The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is seen being set upon by a woman as soon as she arrived at a car park at Lake Haven.

She was pushed to the ground but quickly managed to regain the upper hand - despite the verbal abuse of several bystanders. 

Another girl then joined in the fighting, attacking the blonde victim and forcing her to the ground.  

One of the two attackers then held the victim by the hair and landed more than a dozen blows to the back of her head.

As the victim fled to her car, one of the alleged attackers was heard shouting 'don't talk s*** again' and then charged at the car.

As the fuming assailant stormed off, she was complimented by a male friend dressed in football shorts. 'That's how it's done, babe,' he said.

The victim's mother told Daily Mail Australia she had not realised how severe the attack was when her daughter initially rang her from the car afterwards.

'She called me the minute after she got back into the car in hysterics, telling me that she'd been bashed. 

'Obviously I didn't understand the severity of it. I was trying to tell her go home. 

'That's what we did - and we had the beautiful opportunity to watch the video and realise the severity of it.'

Mother and daughter then reported the incident to the police station. 

The mother told Daily Mail Australia her daughter was asked to come up to the local skate park before the attack.  

A 14-year-old girl and a 16-year-old girl were charged with affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm and will appear in Wyong Children's Court tomorrow morning.
