When you gotta go, you gotta go - very, very fast.

Authorities in Pekin, Illinois, say a man who was clocked driving his motorcycle nearly 150 mph earlier this week had an excuse: he had to pee.

Adam Lester, 26, was spotted doing about 140 mph on the McNaughton Bridge on Tuesday night and arrested.

When the arresting officer told Mr. Lester to put his hands behind his back so he could be handcuffed, he told the officer he 'had to pee.'

Unfortunately for Mr. Lester, he had to wait until he was in custody and taken to a police precinct to hit the head. 

Mr. Lester was busted by a city police officer conducting speed checks at the nearly one-mile-long bridge at about 7:30 p.m. The speed limit on the bridge is 55 mph.

As Mr. Lester passed the officer, he was clocked doing nearly 100 mph over the posted speed limit.

'The officer said he even checked (the gun) twice' to verify its 140-mph reading, a department spokesman told the Pekin Times.

The officer quickly began to pursue Mr. Lester and watched as he began to slow down. However, he still watched him 'blow through' a red light after he crossed the bridge.

The officer then lost sight of him.

Shortly after, the officer spotted Mr. Lester again - stopped between two vehicles that were parked between two buildings. The officer got out of his cruiser and 'snuck up' on Mr. Lester and a woman who also was on the bike. 

Mr. Lester's female passenger later told police that he knew the officer was chasing him, which is why he ran through the red light in an attempt to avoid authorities.

The woman also said that after they'd stopped, Mr. Lester told her to switch jackets with him.

Court records show that Mr. Lester has been cited three times in the past month for speeding. He's also been convicted of speeding three times between 2008 and 2010. He's also been convicted of other traffic violations. 

For Tuesday's joyride, Mr. Lester has been charged with speeding more than 40 mph over the limit and fleeing and attempting to elude police, both misdemeanors, as well as other traffic violations.

Additionally, he was charged with endangering the welfare of a minor because his female passenger is only 16 years old. That charge, however, was not included in the charges filed by prosecutors on Wednesday.

Mr. Lester posted $200 bond. His next court appearance is scheduled for November 4.
