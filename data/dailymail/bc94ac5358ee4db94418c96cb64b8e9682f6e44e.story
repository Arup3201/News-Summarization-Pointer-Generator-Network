For the 250,000 people who lined London's streets to celebrate the New Year, the resolution at the top of their list for 2014 should be to put litter in bins.

A quarter of a million people packed the banks of the River Thames on Tuesday night to enjoy what was billed as the 'world's first multi-sensory fireworks display'.

But as soon as the pyrotechnic spectacular was over and the crowds began to head for home, a mammoth clean-up operation was launched.

Mess: Operation Clean Up was launched in the early hours of New Years Day after more than 250,000 people packed the streets of London to watch the fireworks

Piled high: Council workers faced mountains of rubbish across central London. An estimated 85 tonnes of waste was collected, including 15,000 champagne bottles

Clean team: The council said 119 members of staff were deployed in central London to tackle the mountains of rubbish left by the crowds

Wreckage: Rubbish was strewn across the pavement and main road along London's Embankment, after people waited for hours to get the prime viewing spot opposite the London Eye

Teams of refuse workers moved in to return London to its best ahead of the New Year's Day parade.

Westminster Council deployed 52 vehicles and 119 members of staff throughout the night's festivities to ensure the streets were cleared in time for the annual pageant, which started at noon.

But they were faced with mountains of rubbish with the crowds creating an estimated 85 tonnes of waste, including around 15,000 champagne bottles discarded in central London.

Nearly 100 people were arrested as an estimated quarter of a million people lined the banks of the River Thames as the chimes of Big Ben rang in 2014. Elsewhere revellers committed a litany of typical night-out offences.

The Metropolitan Police said officers arrested 39 people for drunk and disorderly behaviour, 21 for assault, 16 for affray, six for drug related offences, six for public order offences and four others.

Hard at work: As the revellers headed home, refuse teams were out in force to clear up the mess left behind

Efficient: One council employee carries a broom, gets straight to work close to the Houses of Parliament as the crowds begin to clear

Party spirit: A reveller stops to speak to a member of the team clearing up after the party came to an end near Parliament

The force had 3,800 officers on 
duty for fireworks alone, while London Ambulance Service received 1,100 
calls between 7pm and midnight, and 469 in the first hour of 2014.

Chief
 Inspector Robyn Williams said: 'Visitors were not put off by the threat
 of wind and rain and the viewing areas filled up quicker than ever 
before.

'Officers worked 
hard, alongside stewards, to keep people safe during the event and 
ensure that everyone who came into central London was able to make their
 way home at the end of the night.

'Crowds were good natured and there were no major issues reported to police.'

Working through the night: Fifty-nine refuse lorries were sent out on to the streets to aid the clean-up mission

The teams faced a race against the clock to get the streets clear in time for the start of the annual New Year's Day pageant, which began at noon

An arduous task: The scale of the job is clear as rubbish stretches as far as the eye can see

Lone sweeper: One worker tackles a vast stretch of road as the last of the revellers head home after a night of celebrating

Never ending: Teams make in roads into the rubbish left all over the pavement. But their job is only half done as one moves on to tackle the waste left in the middle of the main road

A messy night: For the refuse teams in London, New Year's Eve proved to be a long night's work

Events attracted party-goers across the country with 80,000 descending on Edinburgh for its famous Hogmanay street party and firework displays in Cardiff and Belfast.

Thousands of revellers in London braved the threat of rain to enjoy the spectacular fireworks display, when peach snow and orange-scented bubbles descended on a section of the crowd.

London mayor Boris Johnson said there was 'no better way to celebrate the highs of 2013 and the start of an exciting new year' than enjoying 'one of the world's most dazzling fireworks displays'.

Party time: A group of friends celebrate the start of 2014 in Soho, dressed as superheroes

The Met Police said officers arrested 39 people for drunk and disorderly behaviour, 21 for assault, 16 for affray, six for drug related offences, six for public order offences during the course of the night. A group of party-goers chat with police officers on their way home

Worse for wear: For many the start of 2014 was welcomed with a headache after the festivities the night before

A burst of colour erupted from the London Eye on the Southbank as midnight struck and the crowds celebrated the start of 2014
