Saido Berahino scored four times in a West Bromwich Albion rout — but you wouldn’t have guessed it by his grumpy expression.

The in-demand striker refused to celebrate any of his four goals in this majestic victory.

Luckily, new boss Tony Pulis has an impressive record with ‘problem’ players, which may come in handy when dealing with the troubled Berahino.

Not that Berahino saw any problem with his celebration, insisting he was 'acting professionally.' 

‘I was just handling business and acting professionally and that’s it,’ said Berahino. ‘There’s no need for me to explain myself on not celebrating goals. It is what it is.’ Asked if his lack of celebration was out of respect to Gateshead, he said: ‘No. I just didn’t want to celebrate and that was it. I was just acting professionally.’

Pulis has the dual challenge of keeping the 21-year-old at the club, amid interest from Liverpool and Tottenham, while also giving him something to smile about.

‘He won’t be the first boy to have problems off the pitch,’ said Pulis. ‘I have signed players who have had massive problems off the pitch and worked with them and got the best out of them. ‘We are all different. I have had players turn up late and had players not turn up at times. I have had players do things that would make your hair curl. But I have dealt with it and that is what management is about. 

Interpret the Berahino show in any way that you wish. Pulis will no doubt have taken pleasure in four beautifully-taken goals, including two sublime, curling finishes that are rapidly becoming his trademark.

But the striker adopted the same grumpy expression after each goal, offering the impression that his art-form was a chore. 

He has been linked with a January move while contract talks have been shelved. West Brom insist that they do not need to sell their star forward to strengthen, although Pulis did accept that it would allow him to ‘buy a lot more’.

New manager Tony Pulis insistshe has experience in sorting out troubled players

The new manager can, at least, reflect on a first fence successfully cleared in his first match in charge. Yet as peculiar as it may sound, West Brom were pretty dire until the 42nd-minute breakthrough. Eventually they cut the visitors apart with Victor Anichebe, James Morrison and Chris Brunt adding to Berahino’s four.

As Pulis recognises, sterner challenges await with Hull City’s visit in the Premier League on Saturday.
