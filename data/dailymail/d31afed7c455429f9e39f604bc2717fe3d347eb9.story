An Australian man who was killed after being 'smashed' by a huge wave on a remote Indonesian beach has been described as a passionate and talented sportsman.

Peter Luke, 27, was surfing five-metre waves off Jelenga Beach in West Sumbawa on Tuesday when he went missing.

Police in Indonesia said Mr Luke's body was recovered from a reef by his two friends who were looking for him after he went missing.

Kes Mccrindle, a friend believed to be in Indonesia with Mr Luke when he died, took to Facebook to pay tribute to him.

'We made his last week an absolute ripper. I was with him in the line up just before it happened and he was so happy,' he wrote.

Another friend Levi Muddle said the Australian teacher's 'bright aura' and passion for life were contagious.

Mitch Roberts posted: 'He went doing what he loved. Saw and did a lot more in his short life than most people will do in a full one. LEDEND.'

West Sumbawa police chief Teddy Hendyawan Syarif said the surf at the spot known as Scar Reef was huge at the time Mr Luke was killed.

'The victim's death was caused by a wave smashing into him, which at that time was massive, up to five metres high,' he told reporters.

Indonesian police are co-ordinating with Australian authorities to repatriate Mr Luke's body.

Friends and family have flocked to social media to pay their respects to the 27-year-old

Mr Luke grew up in Warrnambool, on the south-western coast in Victoria.

He moved to NSW after finishing high school at Warrnambool College to study at Southern Cross University.

In recent years he was living in Byron Bay, before heading overseas where it is believed he worked at a ski resort at Whistler in Canada.

Warrnambool Surf Life Saving Club president Michael Owen said Mr Luke was a talented member of the local surf life saving club and started out as a nipper.

'He was a really strong club member who started as a talented junior and went on to a full-time summer lifeguard,' Mr Owen told the Warrnambool Standard.

'Peter did a lot of voluntary work as a lifesaver and had a big impact on our club.

'Heâ€™ll be remembered as an approachable and happy man who also loved surfing.'

A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said: 'Consular officials are providing assistance to the family of an Australian man who has died in Indonesia.'

Mr Luke is survived by his sister Laura and parents Allan and Mary.

The island of Sumbawa lies to the east of better-known islands Lombok and Bali, but its waves lure surfers who are willing to make the trek.
