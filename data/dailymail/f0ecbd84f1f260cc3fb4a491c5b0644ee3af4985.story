An Indonesian grave robber has admitted stealing the bones of twin babies for black magic spells which he believed would enable him to fly and be invisible, police said today.

Police detained Resi Rokhis Suhana, 27, in the south of the main island of Java on Sunday, following reports that bones had been stolen from graves. 

He was arrested in a banana plantation in Cilacap district in possession of bones, ripped white shrouds of the type used in Muslim burials, women's underwear and a sickle, police said.

Local police chief Andry Triaspoetra said: ‘In preliminary questioning, he admitted robbing the graves to perfect a magical power called “Ultimate Magical Knight”.’

Following his arrest, Suhana was admitted to hospital to evaluate his mental health.

Some still believe in black magic in Muslim-majority Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago of more than 17,000 islands inhabited by a kaleidoscope of different peoples.

In 2003, a man was arrested for eating the flesh of a freshly buried old woman in what he believed was part of a ritual to make him invincible.

Earlier this year the justice ministry proposed banning ‘black magic’ that causes death or suffering, an offence which would carry a five-year prison sentence.

‘Black magic’ is thought to be still practiced widely in Indonesia and rituals vary from incantations to ward off a common cold, to murder and grave robbing to access body parts to enhance supernatural powers.

There have been various cases of grave robbers stealing the bodies of children. Dead virgin teenage girls are particularly sought after and many families guard their children’s bodies for 40 days after the burial to protect their graves. On an auspicious day in the Javanese calendar, babies have been known to be kidnapped and beheaded by sorcerers who believe that burying the head in front of their house will bring their families wealth and luck.

To bring good fortune: A British citizen was arrested in Bangkok last year trying to smuggle foetuses, which had been dry roasted and painted in gold leaf, into Taiwan to sell to wealthy customers online

Local witch doctors, known as ‘dukuns’ are often hired to control the weather especially to stop rain during weddings and big public ceremonies. Magical talisman, spells, oils and clothes with magical properties can be found at local markets.

Black magic is practiced in other parts of Indonesia and Asia as well. Last year British citizen Hok Kuen Chow was arrested in Bangkok after six foetuses were found stuffed into travel bags.

Chow, 28, a Briton born in Hong Kong of Taiwanese parents, was held in the city’s Yaowarat area after police received a tip-off.

He
 is suspected of trying to smuggle the foetuses – from two to seven 
months – back to Taiwan to sell to wealthy customers online.

Chow has reportedly admitted buying the bodies, which had been roasted dry and painted in gold leaf, for 200,000 baht (£4,040).

Back
 in Taiwan he could have sold them for six times that amount to rich 
clients who believe the foetuses will bring them good fortune. ‘The 
bodies are between the ages of two and seven months,’ said Wiwat 
Kumchumnan, of the police’s children and women protection unit.
