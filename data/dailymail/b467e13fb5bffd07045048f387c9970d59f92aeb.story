A total of 83 percent of those interviewed so far (15 of 18 people) said they had recently eaten caramel-coated apples.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged consumers in the United States not to eat commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples until further notice.

'Out of an abundance of caution, CDC recommends that US consumers do not eat any commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples, including plain caramel apples as well as those containing nuts, sprinkles, chocolate, or other toppings, until more specific guidance can be provided,' the CDC said in a statement.

Of the 28 infected, 26 were hospitalized and five people died.

'Listeriosis contributed to at least four of these deaths,' said the CDC.

Nine of the cases were pregnancy-related and involved either mothers-to-be or their newborn infants.
