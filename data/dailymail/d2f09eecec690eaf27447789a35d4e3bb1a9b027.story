Melting ice from the poles could make sea levels rise by up to three feet by the end of the century, scientists claim.

They claim there is a one in 20 chance that ocean levels around the British coast could be around a metre higher by 2100 as a result of climate change.

If such rises were to take place, London’s current sea defences would struggle to cope, with the capital at risk of flooding once a decade.

How the South East could be hit: Researchers say the areas in red would be completely underwater, and believe the Thames Barrier would struggle to cope, with the capital at risk of flooding once a decade

Using a model of ‘medium’ climate 
change, they expect ice melt will contribute between 3.5cm (1.4 in) and 
36.8cm (14in) to average global sea levels by 2100.

Warming
temperatures also cause the sea to expand, in effect doubling the 
increase from ice melt.

Once this is taken into account, alongside storm
surges and weather patterns, the team say the ‘best guess’ for overall 
rise in sea levels globally could be from 6cm (2.4in) up to 69cm (27in).

The team of scientists from the European Ice2sea programme, including academics from the British Antarctic Survey and University of Bristol, are the first to try and accurately predict how polar ice melt will contribute to rises in future sea levels.

The authors say the report is the most detailed yet into the loss of ice from Greenland, Antarctica and glaciers.

Rises at the more extreme end of the scale would spell disaster for small Pacific island states like Tuvalu, and other low-lying nations such as the Maldives.

Cities inhabited by millions, including London and New York, will also have to have to build up defences.

The Thames Barrier would struggle to cope with predicted storm surges, experts say, leaving London at risk of 'great floods'

Current defences are only adequate to provide protection to the one-in-one thousand years, shown by the dark black line. This would be substantially reduced with a change in regional sea level to approximately once in 12 years with a metre rise, the researchers say.

Professor David Vaughan, of the British Antarctic Survey who is coordinating the programme, said: ‘Today as the glaciers and ice sheets lose their ice, the water that they once held has melted and flowed in to rivers and seas, increasing their volume and raising global sea levels.

‘Current rates of sea level rise are already having impacts on the most vulnerable communities and ecosystems.

‘It is likely some future ice loss and sea level rise is now unavoidable.

Ice2sea projections of regional variations in sea-level rise to 2100: The top image shows the 'mid-range' scenario of ice loss, and bottom the 'high-end' scenario. These scenarios were developed from ice2sea projections and take account of uncertainty in emissions, global climate, and glacial
projections. The black lines show the contour of mean global sea-level rise due to continental ice-loss, thermal expansion of the oceans.

'But nevertheless, understanding why changes are occurring today and how they could increase in the future is the first step in maintaining the security of our coastal regions for future generations.’

The researchers said if climate change continued to accelerate, it would lead to bigger sea level rises and more extreme storm surges.

And they said rises in sea levels would not stop after 2100, with increases between 2100 and 2200 likely to be much greater than during the 21st century.

Capitals around the world would be hit.

The team predict the rises could entirely wipe out the Maldives

Floods like brought by Superstorm Sandy could begin to devastate New York City every two years as sea levels rise by five feet by the year 2100, according to the startling new predictions released by climate scientists.

The sea level projections mean that much smaller floods will produce more catastrophic effects on the city. New York was proven to be extremely vulnerable by the 11-foot storm surge that battered the city in October.

The new data could reignite debate over whether the city should construct a $17billion system of flood barriers and spend another $12billion shoring up outlying areas of the city like the Rockaway Peninsula.
