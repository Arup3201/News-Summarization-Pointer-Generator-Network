An Alaskan judge has recommended that a medical custody order that has kept a 27-year-old insomniac in hospital for seven months should be lifted.

Hunting guide Bret Bohn was taken to hospital in October last year after he started to hallucinate after not sleeping for 11 days.

But in November Bohn was put into protective custody after his parents, Lorraine and Glen Bohn, and the doctors treating him disagreed about the medication he was being prescribed.

Hope: Bret Bohn could soon be free of a medical custody order which his family claim has led to him being given strong medication

Change: Bret Bohn was working as a hunting guide when he suffered insomnia brought on by steroids he had been prescribed

When Bohn's condition deteriorated, his parents wanted to have power of attorney but a court ruled in favor of the state having protective custody.

The resulting state guardianship order, which was put into place on November 15, led to an anxious and lengthy legal battle by his family to gain access to him and have a say in his treatment.

If the recommendation to end the protective order is agreed by a superior judge, Bohn will once again have the right to make his own decisions about his medical treatment, as well as personal and financial choices.

''He can be his own man again,' the family's attorney, Mario Bird, told the Alaska Dispatch, adding that Bohn would be released from the care of his state-appointed guardian.

The 27-year-old, who worked as a guide in Wasilla, had fallen sick during a hunting trip on October 11. He was prescribed anti-anxiety drugs and medication for insomnia, but within a few days he had become unresponsive.

It is thought his original case of insomnia was a side effect of steroids he had been prescribed while recovering from an operation.

By January, doctors said he was suffering from autoimmune encephalitis, in which his immune system was attacking his brain.

When his parents clashed with doctors over complaints that the drugs he was prescribed were causing him to deteriorate, they had their visits limited to just one hour a day.

Friends of Bohn described how the practical joker who loved the outdoors quickly became a shell of a man, unable to get up or hold a conversation.

A picture posted of on the Free Bret Bohn Facebook page in April showed the once fit young man with a face swollen from medication.

'A picture tells alot! Bret is definately declining on all these drugs,' the accompanying caption read.

The situation came to a head shortly after that picture was taken. As a hospital worker tried to take Bohn back to a locked ward in his wheelchair, the young man's mother, Lorraine Philips-Bohn, intervened.

She allegedly pushed the hospital employee aside and fled with her son, according to court documents.

Progress: The courts have recommended that Bohn should be allowed to make his own decisions again

When Mrs Bohn was arrested at a medical clinic in Seattle for kidnapping, she told police she had just wanted a second opinion on her son's condition, the Daily News reported.

No formal charges were made against her.

Bohn wasn't present at his hearing on Friday, but he listened into the proceedings on a telephone. He is currently staying with family in Idaho.

After the hearing, his attorney, Mr Bird said: 'I think all the parties have come to the agreement that Bret Bohn has regained capacity - thanks be to God - and he is now ready to reenter society as the young man he was before he had a guardian placed over him last fall.'

Bohn's mother added that her son was happy to have his rights back, and said: 'He's doing great, able to make his own decisions ... Iâ€™m just happy, really happy.'
