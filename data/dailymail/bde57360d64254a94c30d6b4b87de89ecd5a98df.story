With more than 50,000 operations performed each year according to the The British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons, cosmetic surgery is more popular than ever before.

But going under the knife to fix bodily woes doesn't always pay off, with new research revealing that two thirds of those who have had surgery say they wish they hadn't.

Of the 2,638 people surveyed, 65 per cent said they regretted the operation and a third confessed that the results weren't what they hoped for, with just 28 per cent declaring themselves pleased.

Under the knife: 65 per cent, of the 2,638 people aged 18 and over from around the UK, who have had plastic surgery in the past five years, said they regretted it

Second thoughts: Katie Price, pictured here in 2011, has spoken of her regret at having too much plastic surgery

Of the men and women polled, 31 per cent had had breast implants, 27 per cent a nose job and 24 per cent liposuction.

Common complaints included complications, which were cited by almost a quarter of respondents, while 17 per cent were angry that side-effects weren't fully explained.

So disastrous were the experiences of 13 per cent of those surveyed, they actually felt less confident after the surgery.

Another eight per cent revealed that the cost of the operation had left them in dire financial straits.

The perils of surgery are well-documented thanks to the well-publicised disaster stories featured on TV shows such as Channel 5's Botched Up Bodies and TLC's Extreme Beauty Disasters.

Others to speak out about the risks of going under the knife include the surgically enhanced Katie Price, who in 2011, revealed that she regretted some of the choices she had made.

'There was a time when I went mad and my
 lips were ­hideous and I looked like a duck,' she told the Sunday Mirror.

'I look at old ­pictures 
and I'm scared at what I did to myself. I'm not happy with my boobs at all. I had them reduced because I 
had huge boobs. They were ridiculous.'

Although Price is yet to rule out having more surgery, the majority of respondents to the new poll, which was conducted by solicitors Medical Accident Group, said they wouldn't repeat the experience.

Of the 17 per cent who would consider having more cosmetic surgery, half of those would want to repeat same cosmetic procedure as before.

Speaking about the results, Ally Taft, a partner at Medical Accident Group, said: ‘There are many risks associated with what are often major operations and, unfortunately, we see the ones that go wrong.

'The cosmetic surgery sector is not particularly well-regulated so it is important that people consider whether to go through with a procedure very carefully and carry out thorough research into their surgeon or clinic.'
