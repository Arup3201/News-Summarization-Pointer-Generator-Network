A passenger plane with a suspected flat tyre was forced to circle over Norway for nearly three hours before making an emergency landing at the capital's main airport.

The plane circled the skies to burn off fuel before attempting the landing at Oslo Airport in Gardermoen.

The Novair Airbus A321 was carrying almost 200 passengers and crew when it landed safely on Sunday night.

A tyre may have been punctured when the plane was taking off while en route to Chania on the Greek island of Crete.

The flight crew declared an emergency and the airport activated a full alert, The Local reported. 

The plane was carrying mostly Norwegian citizens who were heading to Greece for their holidays.

After the plane landed, Lasse André Vangstein, press officer at Oslo airport, told the Norwegian News Agency (NTB): 'It went very well. The plane landed normally without any indications of any errors.

'It is too early to say whether there really was a puncture or just an [instrument] indication of a puncture.'

Worried mother Jane Andersen, whose 11-year-old son, Magnus, was on the plane with his father, rushed to the airport when she learned of the emergency landing.

She heard the plane landed safely while she was en route to see him: 'It was a relief. Now the only thing I want to do is just give [Magnus] a hug.'

The passengers were offered hotel rooms and were scheduled to make the four-hour flight to Chania on Monday morning.
