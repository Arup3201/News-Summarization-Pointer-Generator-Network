It seems there are more uses for Vegemite than spreading it on toast.

Julie Gould, from Sunshine Coast in Queensland,  prefers her classic Aussie spread on canvas.

The 48-year-old artist has been using the popular breakfast spread to paint life-like portraits of celebrities since 1985 when she was an art student.

Julie Gould is one clever Vegemite and prefers her yeasty spread on canvas

'I was completing my commercial arts certificate and we had to use any medium other than painting materials to work with,' Ms Gould told Daily Mail Australia.

'We had to find something organic to work with so it could be blueberries, make up, licorice and even chocolate but I went with Vegemite.'

The busy mother spends between three to four days to paint a complete portrait of someone.

'I'm a perfectionist,' she said.

'I put a lot of time and solid effort into it and I can't stop myself from looking at it because I'm changing it all the time.'

Gould has painted almost 30 portraits and her collection includes Dame Edna (pictured)

She has painted almost 30 portraits and her collection includes Dame Edna, Crocodile Dundee, Oprah Winfrey, Prince Harry and Vegemite founder Fred Walker.

'I have a lot more in progress like Hugh Jackman and Mel Gibson but I won't show them until they're completely finished.

The secret to Ms Gould's technique is to add hot boiling water.

'There are other secrets but I keep them to myself,' she said.

Ms Gould has taken her obsession with a classic Aussie spread to the
 extreme creating amazing artworks

'I use roughly one tube for each portrait and I always use hot water to turn it into a paste.

'You can't use cold water because it clots up and won't give you that air brush effect.

'I also paint layers for light and dark shades. You can't get black from Vegemite so I have to paint layers and let it dry so I can build it up to get it dark.' 

Ms Gould said her artworks last a lifetime - saying it 'darkens with age'.

'Vegemite is high in salt so it doesn't rot and I spray on sealant as well so it lasts a really long time.

'You can tell when they're freshly made because they have that gingery looking effect.'

Her masterpieces will feature at the Aussie Icons and Inventions exhibition in Yamba, northern New South Wales starting from December 6

She added: 'It looks like an old sepia photograph when it's finished.' 

'I love it and I love that people like my artworks because I'm really critical with my artworks and I wouldn't show them if they didn't look like someone.
