Jimmy Savile's former driver was arrested last night over allegations that he raped a teenage girl while working as a DJ in the 1960s.

Ray Teret, 71, was being held by police in Manchester along with his lodger, 61-year-old Alan Ledger and both have now been released on bail.

Teret faces three separate sex abuse allegations, all reported following the shaming of the late TV presenter, but police have stressed the claims are not connected to his friendship with Savile.

Teret was photographed with the Beatles in his 1960s heyday when he was Savile's support DJ, chauffeur and sidekick.

They shared a flat in Salford. Teret 
later became a DJ for Radio Caroline. He was arrested yesterday along 
with Ledger at a dilapidated six-bedroom house in Altrincham, Greater 
Manchester.

Police said a 71-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of rape after three separate allegations.

The 61-year-old man was being held on suspicion of rape in connection with one of the complaints.

'Father' and 'son': Savile (pictured left with Teret, left, and another man) referred to his chauffeur as 'my son,' and in response Teret said called him 'father'

Detective
 Inspector Simon Davies, of the Serious Sexual Offences Unit, said: 'I 
want to make it absolutely clear that this is not an investigation into 
the late Jimmy Savile, nor do any of the allegations relate to any 
involvement by Savile.

'The victims who have come forward have shown tremendous courage. We have a duty to investigate their complaints thoroughly.'

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman
 said today: 'A 71-year-old man and a 61-year-old man arrested on 
suspicion of rape yesterday have been bailed until November 29 pending 
further inquiries.'

In a previous interview, Teret 
discussed his time living with the TV star, saying: ‘There were so many 
[girls] around.

What Jimmy liked: Teret said: 'I think Jim, preferred girly girls rather than smart girls... Not the ones that go to work and be dead straight and sensible'

Arrested: DJ Ray Teret, right being presented with an award at St Winifreds School, is facing three allegations but police have stressed the claims are not connected to his friendship with Savile. It comes after he was jailed for six months in 1999 (left) for seducing and bedding a 15-year-old schoolgirl

'The Sixties were the sex years. All the girls wanted to 
try sex and all the boys wanted to be into sex.

‘He was a pop star. When you’re in that business they’re always there in front of you.'

When asked what sort of girls Jimmy 
liked, Teret said: ‘I think Jim, preferred girly girls rather than smart
 girls... girls who are prepared to do a cartwheel and jump and dance 
and have a giggle and a laugh.

‘Not the ones that go to work and be dead straight and sensible. He liked fun girls, show girls.'

He recalled that Jimmy referred to him
 as ‘My son’, to which he  dutifully responded by calling him ‘Father’.

Jimmy’s protege went on to become a DJ for Radio Caroline, at which 
point they parted company.

In March 1999, Teret, then 57, was jailed for six months for seducing and bedding a 15-year- old schoolgirl.

On bail: A policeman waits outside the front door as they remove evidence from the house where Teret lives. Both he and Ledger were released on bail today

Meanwhile Savile's nephew Guy Marsden backed calls for the body of the Top of the Pops presenter to be exhumed and cremated.

He said on Wednesday that he '100 per
 cent' supported families who called for Savile's body to be moved away 
from the graves of their loved ones in Scarborough's Woodlands Cemetery 
following claims that Savile abused 300 people over six decades.

Mr Marsden, from Leeds, said: 'If it 
was one of mine who was buried there, I wouldn't like it if someone like
 Jimmy was in the same place.'

Teret also acted as a chauffeur for Jimmy Savile, pictured with his famous Rolls-Royce in 1966, as well as being his support DJ
