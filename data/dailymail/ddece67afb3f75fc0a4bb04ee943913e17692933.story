The Austrian Grand Prix stewards will re-open the investigation into Felipe Massa's 190mph crash with Sergio Perez on Friday.

Perez was dealt a five-place grid penalty for this weekend's race in Austria following the dramatic last-lap collision at the Canadian Grand Prix.

Both Perez and Massa were taken to hospital after the accident, with Massa blasting the actions of the Force India driver.

'I spoke to him at the medical centre,' said the Brazilian after both drivers were released from hispital following a series of precautionary checks.

'I was so disappointed with him. I said he needs to learn. I wanted him to put himself in my place. I had a huge crash.

'It's not the first time he had turned into somebody under braking. He has done this many times but he didn't say anything. He just turned left.'

Perez however, has since maintained his innocence in the crash, and Force India will now present new evidence to the stewards at their hearing at 9am on Friday.

Championship leader Nico Rosberg refused to apportion blame on either driver, instead praising the safety standards within Formula One.

'I saw the replays after the race, but I don't really want to judge what happened,' said Rosberg. 'I trust that the stewards looked at it in great detail and came to the right conclusion.

'It shows the safety of these cars, and where we have come to. At the same time, it was also evident of the speeds in which we are going round at, too.'
