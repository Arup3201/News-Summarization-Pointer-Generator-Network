The final printed issue of the UK’s 
longest-running children’s comic will be released on its 75th birthday 
in December, its publishers have said.

The Dandy, best known for cartoon 
character Desperate Dan, is being pulled from shelves following a drop 
in circulation in recent years.

Dundee-based publisher DC Thomson 
said the comic will still be available online and it has 'exciting 
plans in the pipeline' to take it in a 'different direction'.

Ellis Watson, chief executive of the 
company’s newspaper and magazine publishing operations, said: 'Dan has 
certainly not eaten his last cow pie.

'Struggled in digital age': The very first The Dandy comic (left) was published on December 4, 1937, and the brand was still going strong nearly ten years later (right), but has suffered a serious slump in modern times

Dundee-based publisher DC Thomson 
said the comic will still be available online and they have 'exciting 
plans in the pipeline' to take it in a 'different direction'

'All of The Dandy’s characters are just 110 days away from a new lease of life.'

The decision comes after DC Thomson 
announced it was carrying out a review of all of its magazine titles due
to 'challenges' being faced by the publishing industry.

It was prompted by falling 
circulation numbers, with only about 8,000 copies of The Dandy being 
sold a week, down from more than 2million during its peak in the 
1950s.

The Dandy, which launched in 1937, 
has featured characters such as Bananaman, Korky the Cat, Cuddles and 
Dimples, and Beryl the Peril.

The last edition of the comic will be
released at the beginning of December to mark its official 75th 
anniversary and will include a reprint of the first edition of The 
Dandy.

Mr Watson said: 'On December 4, we’ll
publish our 75th anniversary edition - and now that the cat’s out of 
the bag - I can confirm that this will be our last print edition.

'It’s what comes online then that will set the tone for the next 75 years and that’s why I’m so livid these plans nearly leaked.

'I’m absolutely livid that we’ve had an internal leak about what’s in the pipeline for one of our most popular titles.

'We’re counting down 110 days until the big 75th anniversary bash and we’re working on some tremendously exciting things.

'I’ve closed down loopholes to ensure much tighter internal security.

'We’ve heard about people trying to 
find out the plans by hacking into www.dandy.com so we’ve taken it all 
offline and moved into core project offices. We’re in lockdown.'

DC Thomson said the Dandy Annual will continue to be printed and the 2013 edition is already on the shelves.

A book celebrating the 75th 
anniversary of The Dandy was launched at the Edinburgh International 
Book Festival this week and the comic will also feature in exhibitions 
at the National Library of Scotland and the Cartoon Museum.

A series of re-launches has failed to regenerate the comic's sales; right, the Dandy's long-time rival and sister title, The Beano

stands in Dundee city centre, alongside Minnie the Minx, from The 
Dandy’s sister title The Beano.

A spokesman for the Dundee-based 
publisher said: ‘There are many challenges within the industry at 
present, but we’re excited that the digital revolution has also given us
an opportunity to innovate and develop.

‘We’re confident that future generations will continue to enjoy our much-loved products and characters.’

Despite outlasting other once-popular 
comics, including The Beezer and The Topper, a series of recent 
relaunches have failed to regenerate The Dandy’s sales.

In 2007, it was rebranded as Dandy 
Xtreme, a fortnightly version of the comic, and in 2010 its creators 
introduced celebrity-themed strips starring well-known figures such as 
Simon Cowell and Jeremy Clarkson.

But sales continued to fall, dropping by 50 per cent between 2010 and 2011.

Britain’s
most popular comic The Beano has also struggled in recent years.  
According to the most recent figures, its circulation was only 38,000 at 
end of 2011.

Anita O’Brien, curator of the Cartoon Museum in London, said comics have struggled to keep up in the digital age.

She said: ‘Kids have other things to spend their time and money on these days like playing computer games and things like that.

‘We
do workshops and lots of kids want to create their own stories and do 
enjoy reading them, but there are definitely challenges.’
