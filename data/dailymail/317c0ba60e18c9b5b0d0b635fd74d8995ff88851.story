When 20-year-old Sophiia-Marie de Faia noticed she was suddenly gaining weight, she visited her doctor to see if anything was wrong.

Told it was 'just stress', Sophiia, who lives in Southampton, was sent away. And she was repeatedly dispatched with the same diagnosis when she returned again and again over the next few months to ask what was happening to her body.

It was not until March, when she had been in labour for four days, that it finally dawned on doctors and Sophiia herself that she was - despite taking the Pill religiously - pregnant.

Surprise, surprise: Sophiia-Marie de Faia and baby Michael on the day he was born, which was also the first time Sophiia realised she was pregnant

'I'd been feeling incredibly sick 
since 
late June, which [my partner Liam and I have] worked out is most likely 
when we conceived,' Sophiia told MailOnline. 
'I
went to my doctor multiple times and he just said it was stress.

'Towards the end, from around 
February, I started to fully feel kicking. I didn't know what that felt 
like, and I'd heard from someone 
with IBS that she felt little bubble-like sensations all the time and 
her tummy felt hard because of that, so I brushed it off.'

Sophiia continued: 'It started to 
really annoy me early March, so I got an emergency appointment at my 
doctor's surgery.

'The woman we saw didn't seem to want to help in any 
way at all. She told me that she could't do anything for me as 
emergency appointments were reserved for emergencies. She didn' even 
offer me advice.

'She felt my stomach, and said nothing. I heard from the
midwives at the hospital that she'd written in my notes that my stomach
felt hard, but she didn't do anything about it, or even suggest the 
obvious - that I was pregnant - even though I'd also complained of feeling pressure 
throughout my abdomen.'

Mother and son: Sophiia, 20, says Michael, now four months, is the best thing that has ever happened to her and boyfriend Liam, 18

But the riddle was solved in March, when early one morning Sophiia found herself in agony, unable to sit, stand or lie down.

'I was in early labour for a good 
couple of days, but I thought it was just period pain! It got really bad
the night before he was born - I couldn’t sit or lay down, and standing
up was agony too.

'I only knew something was wrong when
I felt the unbelievable urge to push, got to the bathroom and I started
bleeding everywhere.

'I phoned an ambulance at about 
5:30am and when they got to our house they asked all sorts of questions 
about the pain, and told me I was most probably pregnant.'

Father and son: Liam, 18, with his baby son Michael shortly after his birth - which came as a complete surprise to both his parents

Sophiia and her boyfriend Liam, 18, 
had been together for a year before having Michael, and had talked about having babies but 
decided to wait for a while since they were both still in college.

But they didn't get to wait very long, as that night the pair of them were rushed to hospital, both in complete shock.

'I literally didn't believe what they
were saying. I was rushed into A&E at Southampton General and they 
asked me the questions again, and again told me I was more than likely 
pregnant.

'I was in so much shock that 
regardless of how many times they said it, I didn't believe it. I was 
taken to another room where they took an ultrasound of my stomach, and 
it showed my baby was right down in the birth canal.'

The surprised mother-to-be had been in labour for 
almost four days before she fully realised what was happening. They 
rushed her to Princess Anne maternity hospital where she gave birth 
naturally to her son about an hour later.

Hello, world: Baby Michael, who was conceived despite his mother Sophiia being on The Pill

Luckily, Sophiia isn't a big drinker and doesn't smoke, so she wasn't inadvertently harming her baby's health while she was pregnant. 'The most I did was drink Red Bull three times a week before a workout,' she said.

She and Liam had been dieting and working out together before the birth, which is partly why she returned again and again to her doctor when she was not losing but actually gaining weight.

But since she was taking the Cerazette contraceptive pill she did not think the weight gain could possibly mean she was pregnant.

'It
upsets me a little that I didn't get to experience pregnancy like other
women do,' Sophiia said. 'I didn’t have any scans or classes for what on earth to do 
when you’re having a baby, but everyone around us always tells us how 
well we're doing, and how well we've coped with the shock.

'Initially when we found out that I was in labour, we were both incredibly scared and in shock, and really didn't know what to do.

'But as soon as our son was born, it was the most intense feeling of love that we just looked at each other and knew what to do.

'Nothing else we've ever done has felt so right, we love our son too much to explain, and couldn't imagine life without him. We're just so lucky to have him, we call him our little miracle.'

Happy family: Liam and Sophiia, pictured with baby Michael, are hoping to marry in April and expand their family as soon as possible

But Sophiia and Liam are less enamoured with the way her doctors treated her.

'I really am not impressed with my doctor. The fact that literally three days before I gave birth my tummy was felt and nothing was said is ridiculous.

'She made such a massive error in judgement. It borders heavily on negligence. I have severe back pain, and have serious pain in my left hip as a result of a terrifying and agonising labour: I can't do anything anymore without being in huge amounts of pain.'

Despite this, the new parents think baby Michael, now four months old, is 'the single most amazing thing to happen' in their lives.

'We're planning to get married in April, and hoping to try for another baby soon because we’d love to expand our family.'

Let's just hope the next one isn't so much of a surprise.

Our little miracle: Next time she is pregnant, Sophiia would like the chance to experience it properly rather than having a surprise birth nine months later
