Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp reflects on England's 3-1 victory over Scotland at Celtic Park on Tuesday.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain opened the scoring for Roy Hodgson's side before captain Wayne Rooney struck twice in the second half to seal victory over their closest rivals.

The pass from Jack Wilshere for the opening goal was as good a long pass as you will see. That’s what happens when you give somebody like him time on the ball.

It was a beautiful pass and matched by a wonderful finish. Wilshere  floated it effortlessly, and the flight of the ball made it almost impossible to defend. It was a fantastic piece of play.

It's good to see England have got two excellent young talents at right back.

Nathaniel Clyne has settled quickly with England.

He was tested by Ikechi Anya but he handled him well. He is assured on the ball, takes up good positions and he’s not afraid to go forward.

Calum Chambers didn’t play but he is another option, though I think his long-term future lies in defensive midfield.

The thing I like about this England team is the pace running through it.

At the World Cup we were so reliant on Raheem Sterling to get us moving but now there is a threat from all over the park.

Danny Welbeck and Oxlade-Chamberlain are so quick up front and both full backs were good going forward against Scotland.

It used to be that without Sterling we would not be much of a threat, but that couldn’t be further from the truth on Tuesday. The only thing I would have liked to see is Ross Barkley get more of a game.
