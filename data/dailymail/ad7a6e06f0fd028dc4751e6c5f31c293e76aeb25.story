The future looks rosé for a Midland hotel which is to sell off some of a hitherto untapped cache of incredibly rare wines, champagnes and spirits - some over 100 years old.

Bosses hope that an auction of just 100 bottles will make thousands towards the upkeep of the 500-year-old Evesham Hotel, in Evesham, Worcestershire.

The sell-off, organised by Littleton Auctions of Evesham, is expected to reach a crescendo when two bottles of highly sought-after 1914 Hine Grande Champagne brandy will go under the hammer.

'I knew I was looking at something special': David Field, general manager at the Evesham Hotel in Evesham, Worcestershire, stumbled across the cache shortly after joining the business six months ago

Massive collection: The sell-off, organised by Littleton Auctions of Evesham, is expected to reach a crescendo when two bottles of highly sought-after 1914 Hine Grande Champagne brandy go under the hammer

Regarded by experts as the brandy equivalent of Penny Black stamps, they are expected to go under the hammer for £3,000 each.

Hotel manager David Field, who stumbled across the cache shortly after joining the business six months ago, said: 'The fact that it's the centenary of The Great Way has added to the Champagne's value.

'I have visions of a well-heeled, patriotic couple popping the cork and raising a glass to the fallen.'

The unique collection was amassed by hotel owner John Jenkinson, 65, who has spent 40 years scouring the world for rare tipples.

'I don't think John realised the value of what he'd collected': Mr Jenkinson poses with a rare bottle of armagnac

Mr Field, 50, said he couldn't believe his eyes when he first walked into the cellar and saw 3,000 bottles of rare alcoholic drinks, including 300 fine whiskies.

He said: 'I don't think John Jenkinson realised the true value of what he'd collected.

'I'm not an expert - out of a hundred, my knowledge of wine is probably 70. I'm not one of those people who talk about wine in their sleep, but I knew I was looking at something special.

'This is an absolute treasure trove for a connoisseur. There are some very rare vintages here that have been stored in perfect condition for all these years.'

Historic: The Evesham Hotel dates back 500 years and the sale of the bottles will go towards its upkeep

Oenophiles will be eager to snap-up eight bottles of 1989 Penfolds Grange, an Australian wine regarded as among the very best. They won't go for less than £300 each.

A 1900 Vieil armagnac will set you back £1,000.

Mr Field stressed the sell-off will hardly dent the hotel's drinks cupboard.

'If you want a 1936 brandy you'll still be able to get one,' he said. 'The reality is, however, that we don't have too many diners asking for a £350 bottle of wine with their meal.'
