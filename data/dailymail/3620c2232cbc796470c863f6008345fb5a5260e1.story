An energetic and inquisitive seven-year-old girl whose mind is 'trapped in a body' that will not do what she wants has won £10.1 million damages.

The award to Eva Totham, after a three-day hearing at London's High Court in December, is believed to be one of the highest ever made for a personal injuries claim following a contested trial.

King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust accepted liability for the serious brain injuries suffered by Eva during her delivery in October 2007 but disputed some of the damages claimed.

Eva, who lives with her parents Sarah and Dean and younger sister in south-east London, was starved of oxygen at birth and has severe cerebral palsy affecting all four limbs.

Mrs Justice Elisabeth Laing said that the DVD she had seen of a day in Eva's life was 'very moving'.

'Eva is a beautiful, engaging child. Her eyes shine. She is determined and concentrates hard on any given activity.'

In a ruling given today, she added: 'I had a strong sense of an energetic, inquisitive mind trapped in a body that will not do what Eva would wish it could do.'

The compensation covers Eva's past and future care, as she is entirely dependent on others for all aspects of day-to-day living, and future loss of earnings.

Solicitor Agata Usewicz, of law firm Hodge Jones & Allen, said later: 'I would like to pay tribute to Eva's parents who have been strong and dignified throughout this lengthy process.

'Eva is a lovely, enthusiastic little girl who makes the most of life despite her limitations.

'This case, as with all of the clinical negligence cases that we handle, was not about money, it was about securing justice.

'No amount of money will ever compensate for the injuries Eva has sustained, but this award will ensure that she is provided with the care she needs for the rest of her life, and has the opportunity to live her life to the fullest.

'The judgment brings to an end six years of the family's fight for justice.'
