A senior employee at a leading British bank could face up to ten years in prison after admitting conspiracy to defraud in connection with rigging interest rates.

The individual, whose identity is protected by a court order, yesterday became the first banker in the UK to plead guilty in court following the ‘Libor’ inter-bank lending scandal.

He is also the first senior worker at a British bank to be convicted of criminal wrongdoing since the financial crash of 2008.

Details of the guilty plea can be reported for the first time following court proceedings yesterday.

A senior employee at a leading British bank could face up to ten years in prison after admitting conspiracy to defraud in connection with rigging interest rates.

But the gagging order regarding the individual’s name, served by Judge Leonard QC at Southwark Crown Court, also prevented the ‘leading bank’ he worked for being identified.

The banker is one of 12 people charged by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) for allegedly manipulating Libor interest rates, which are used to set the price of mortgages and are linked to trillions of pounds worth of financial contracts.

Eleven of the accused are currently awaiting trial. Many have yet to enter formal pleas.

Yesterday’s guilty plea was the first criminal conviction arising from the SFO’s Libor investigation, which began in July 2012.

The Treasury said those found guilty of playing a part in the scandal should feel the ‘full force of the law’.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney has also led calls for bankers to be held to account. In July, he said staff at another bank involved in a scam to defraud taxpayers during the financial crisis could be guilty of ‘criminal conduct’.

Andrea Leadsom, economic secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘The integrity of the City matters to the economy of Britain.

‘Ensuring that the key rates that underpin financial markets are robust, and that anyone who seeks to manipulate them is subject to the full force of the law is vital.’

The public has a legitimate interest in knowing which bankers were allegedly involved in Libor rate-rigging, a judge ruled in a previous case.

The High Court judge said last year that keeping the names of bank bosses secret would be ‘an affront to the principle of open justice’.

He was asked to impose an order giving anonymity to more than 100 bank staff whose emails were handed to the City watchdog during its probe into Libor manipulation. 

The ruling on a civil claim was separate to yesterday’s criminal case.

In the civil case, the judge denied anonymity to staff whose emails were handed over, even though most of them were not accused of any impropriety.

The innocent would not be prejudiced by being named, he ruled, and the public had the right to know who was alleged to have been involved.

He said: ‘The public has a legitimate interest in learning who in the banking community is alleged to have been implicated in the manipulation of Libor.

'For the court to permit individuals who were involved in such manipulation the protection of an anonymity order is not only not necessary for the proper administration of justice, but would be an affront to the principle of open justice and would potentially damage public confidence in the administration of justice.’

The case was brought by a care home that said it was mis-sold a so-called interest rate swap linked to the Libor rate.

Conspiracy to defraud carries a jail term of up to ten years, but the date for the sentencing of the unnamed banker has not yet been set.

In total, seven banks and brokerage firms have settled allegations of interest rate rigging in the UK and US.

These include Barclays, which was fined £290million in June 2012, Royal Bank of Scotland, which paid out £390million, and Lloyds, which was hit with a £148million penalty.

Damning emails showed how traders bragged about moving Libor interest rates up and down to fix their bets on the stock market, promising each other kickbacks and bottles of champagne.

Last night, MPs welcomed the conviction. Chris Leslie, shadow Treasury minister, said: ‘This is not down to a single rogue individual.

‘This is just the beginning of a long process of weeding out a crooked culture in banks which has deep roots.’

Labour MP John Mann, who sits on the Treasury select committee, added: ‘Whoever this banker is, his or her bosses who created the culture that allowed this to happen must be held to account.’

The Government has made manipulating Libor – which stands for the London Interbank Offered Rate – a criminal offence carrying a jail term of up to seven years.

The rate is based on daily submissions lodged by a panel of international banks, and is supposed to reflect the cost at which they borrow from one another.

But some traders manipulated Libor rates to favour their own short-term investments.

They did this by conspiring with colleagues called ‘submitters’, who were responsible for entering the bank’s estimated rate each day.

Some bankers also colluded with rivals and brokers, urging them to either increase or decrease their estimates to push the overall Libor rate up or down.

Libor stands for the London Interbank Offer Rate and is a measure of the interest rate banks charge to borrow between each other.

The rate is set every morning by a panel of banks and overseen by trade body the British Bankers' Association. 

Each bank sets the rates at which it believes it can borrow, from overnight to 12 months. 

There are 150 Libor rates, spanning ten currencies and 15 time periods. It heavily influences how banks price variable rate mortages, such as new tracker and discount deals and standard variable rates. 

Some borrowers also have mortgages linked directly to Libor, which are typically reset every three months.

Traders could make money from tiny movements in the rate due to the millions being gambled on them, however, by the time these shifts of fractions of one per cent reach mortgage pricing their effect would be minimal.

Even those whose mortgages were directly linked to Libor would find changes in their interest rate would have little overall effect.
