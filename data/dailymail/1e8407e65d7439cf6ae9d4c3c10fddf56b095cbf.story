A woman was arrested on suspicion of murder after sheriff's deputies found her boyfriend shot dead and her 3-year-old son's body stuffed in the freezer at her home on an Indian reservation in Southern California, authorities said Saturday.

The child was discovered in a freezer in the garage hidden 'under some items of frozen foods,' the San Diego County sheriff's department said in a statement.

Elaina Rose Welch, 32, was booked on two counts of murder in connection with the deaths.

The man, 32-year-old Julio Monggiotti, was found shot in the chest and wrist. 

The child's name was not released pending an autopsy planned for next week, the sheriff's department said.

Sheriff's deputies received a call Friday from a woman at the Barona Indian Reservation who said her child was dead.

Moments later, tribal police received a call from the same address about an attempted suicide.

An officer with the Barona Tribal Enforcement arrived at the home and talked to a man. Gunshots were heard when the man went inside.

Barona authorities contacted sheriff's deputies for help.

When deputies and the SWAT team arrived, the woman came out of the house carrying a shotgun and walked along a road, where she dropped the weapon.

A family member told U-T San Diego that Welch and her boyfriend had a rocky relationship and that tribal officers have been called several times to break up domestic disputes

The man was pronounced dead at the scene. Deputies searched the property and initially did not find the child, who was hidden in the garage freezer. 

Wallace said Welch keeps several guns at her house.

'It’s just so unreal; no one knows what happened,' she added in an interview with U-T San Diego. 

She described the couple's relationship as stormy with tribal officers regularly called in to deal with domestic disputes.

'They should have taken it seriously in the beginning,' Wallace said. 'That baby wasn’t safe there at all. Now he is dead.'

Welch's Facebook cover photo has the quote: 'I want to be the girl who makes your bad days better, and the one who makes you say, ‘My life has changed since I met her.’'
