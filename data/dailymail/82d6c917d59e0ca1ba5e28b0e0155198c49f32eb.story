Commuters heading home from their first day back at work after Christmas have been hit by 'dangerous overcrowding' at London Bridge station. 

Trains reportedly left the station half-empty after crowds became trapped outside the ticket barriers and stranded commuters at London Bridge tonight took to Twitter to vent their frustration. 

Chris Adams wrote: 'Trains leaving London Bridge half empty because everyone is stuck being crushed in the queuing system outside. Genius.'

Chris Beaumont added: 'Utter bloody chaos on the trains in and out of London Bridge tonight. I've been commuting in London for 16 years and never seen it so bad.' 

Liz Fenwick wrote: 'Train prices rise and so do tempers at London Bridge.' 

And Andy Jones said: 'Really dangerous overcrowding at London Bridge. No trains anywhere for 50 mins & tickets not allowed on alternatives. No policing anywhere.'

The busy rail station partially closed over the festive period due to major engineering work and reopened this morning - only for passengers to be hit by long hold-ups.

As part of the £6.5bn Thameslink programme, London Bridge saw two new platforms opened and new track laid.

But this morning, there were delays of up to 45 minutes at London Bridge station due to a signalling problem. 

It came as commuters were also hit by New Year price hikes, which saw season ticket fare go up by 2.5% from January 2.

Starting during the morning rush-hour and lasting until at least 12 noon, the delays affected passengers with the Southern train company.

Passengers using Southern trains at London Bridge tweeted their experiences this morning.

Lindsey Jenkinson ‏wrote: 'It seems I'm destined to spend the rest of my life sitting on a Southern train outside London Bridge station. Send food.'

Chantelle Maie wrote: 'London Bridge station is such a shambles.'

Martin O'Neill wrote: 'First day back for many, rail fares up and loads of people stranded at London Bridge station. Oh the joy of joys of being British.'

Protests against the fares rise were held at more than 40 stations today. Those demonstrating included trade unionists and the Green Party.

At Brighton station, Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA transport union, said:  'It is now high time to end the annual persecution of rail passengers with constant above-inflation fares hikes.

'Labour should commit itself to a 12-month long fares freeze from next January if it wins the general election in May.'

Southern and Thameslink trains had been unable to call at London Bridge from December 20 to January 4 due to the engineering work.

There also rush-hour problems today for CrossCountry and First Great Western passengers following an overrun of planned engineering work.

This caused buses to replace trains between between Weston-super-Mare and Bristol Temple Meads until around 7.30am, with services back to normal at around 8.15am.

There were other problems for rush-hour train travellers, many of whom were returning to work for the first time since the holiday.

Trains at King's Cross were cancelled because of overrunning Network Rail engineering works last month

A signalling problem at Merstham in Surrey prevented trains towards London from stopping at Redhill, Merstham or Coulsdon South.

This affected passengers travelling on Southern and Thameslink services.

Another signalling problem, near Eaglescliffe in County Durham, meant buses had to replace trains between Middlesbrough and Darlington stations during the morning peak.

A broken-down train at Harrow & Wealdstone in north west London led to delays between London and Milton Keynes Central in Buckinghamshire.

In the West Midlands a broken-down freight train at Bloxwich meant no trains could run between Rugeley Trent Valley and Walsall.

On Merseyside, an electrical supply problems at Meols caused delays to trains between Bidston and West Kirby.

The problems today follow chaotic scenes in London on December 27 when a Network Rail (NR) overrun led to the closure of King's Cross and Paddington stations.

Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the overrun was totally unacceptable, and NR and the Office of Rail Regulation have both launched inquiries.

The NR inquiry report is expected to be completed by the end of this week.

Next week NR chief executive Mark Carne, who has said he is not taking his annual bonus, is due to appear before the House of Commons Transport Committee to explain the December 27 difficulties.
