A 'pimp' has been accused of forcing a 13-year-old prostitute to have his name tattooed on her eyelids when she threatened to run away.

Roman Thomas III was arrested in Miami after the girl was branded with his street name 'Suave' on one eyelid, and 'House' on the other to denote that she belonged to him, police said.

He is accused of pimping the girl, who has not been identified, through an online advertising site as a 'new girl' to men wanting to have sex with children.

The girl was allegedly plied with alcohol and drugs by Thomas and a woman in a Miami motel and coerced into prostitution, the Miami Herald reports.

Thomas will be formally charged on April 13 while a woman, Shanteria Sanders, 23, who has 'Suave' tattooed across her chest, was also charged in the case, according to the Herald.

The pair face charges of human trafficking, false imprisonment, lewd and lascivious exhibition and delivery of a controlled substance to a child.

Thomas, who was meant to be wearing an ankle monitor as part of his probation, has a long criminal record, including counts of 'lewd and lascivious battery' on a child.

He is alleged to have met the 13-year-old girl at the USA Flea Market in Miami, before persuading her to go with him to the motel where he was living.

Thomas and Sanders are accused of taking 'provocative' photographs of the girl before putting them on the Backpage.com website. They then charged men $100 an hour to have sex with her, police say.

They are alleged to have forced the girl to get the tattoos after she threatened to leave.

Their alleged crimes were uncovered when the girl's mother called the police after tracking her daughter down and found her with Thomas.
