A Texas man has been charged with animal cruelty after he shot dead a bull terrier at a Houston-area dog park because he thought the animal was acting in a threatening manner.

The Harris County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that 26-year-old Joseph Potts is facing a count of felony animal cruelty with a deadly weapon in connection to the January 25 shooting at Bay Area Dog Park in Houston.

If convicted, Potts could face 2-10 years in prison. Following his arrest Monday, the 26-year-old suspect was released after posting $5,000 bond.

Justice for Diesel: Joseph Potts is facing a count of felony animal cruelty with a deadly weapon for shooting dead Randall Livingston's 2-year-old dog, Diesel (pictured) 

Tragic: Sheriff's deputies say Potts, 26, was at Bay Area Dog Park in Houston in January when one of his dogs had an interaction with Diesel, which ended with the 26-year-old man shooting the animal three times

Authorities said Potts, himself a dog owner, gunned down a 2-year-old black-and-white Staffordshire bull terrier named Diesel in front of his owner’s horrified mother.

Potts, who is a concealed handgun license holder, told deputies the dog was aggressive toward him, his wife and their two pets.

But witnesses told police that Diesel was playing with other dogs in the park when Potts came up to the bull terrier, kicked him and then shot him three times - once in his leg and twice in his back.

Randall Livingston, Diesel’s owner, told Click2Houston he was excited when the sheriff's department reached a decision this week to charge Potts with a crime in connection to his pet's killing.

'That was obviously the outcome we were looking for,' he said, adding that he hopes Potts learns to 'stay the hell out of the dog park.'

Livingston previously said that on January 25, his mother took his beloved pet to the Bay Area Dog Park to play with other animals.

Cruel: Witnesses said Potts kicked Diesel to get him away from his own dog, and then pulled a Glock and fired on the pooch, striking him in the leg and back

But what started out as a fun Sunday morning outdoors ended in a tragedy when Diesel had an 'interaction' with one of the other pups running around the park.

According to witnesses, the other dog's owner, Joseph Potts, gave Diesel a kick, pulled out his Glock 9-mm and shot the 2-year-old animal three times.

Diesel was rushed to VCA Animals Hospital, where he later died from his injuries.

According to a sheriff’s report cited by Houston Press, Potts told a deputy that he shot Diesel because he approached one of his dogs 'and began to get aggressive.'

After failing to kick Diesel away from his pet, Potts stated that he 'began to fear for the safety of his dogs, his wife and himself.'

The 26-year-old pet owner was quoted as saying that he was sorry for what happened, and that ‘he did not want to harm the dog but felt like he had no choice.’

'Innocent': Randall Livingston insisted that from the time he adopted Diesel when he was just six weeks old, the pup had never exhibited any signs of aggression

But according to an eyewitness, it appeared that Potts was taking his time and carefully aiming the gun at Diesel.

Randall Livingston insisted that from the time he adopted Diesel when he was just six weeks old, the pup had never exhibited any signs of aggression.

Following Diesel's killing, supporters of Randall Livingston launched a Facebook page, which has drawn nearly 9,340 'likes' so far.

A month after Diesel's death, members of the 'Support for Diesel' community came together at Bay Area Dog Park for a ‘Peaceful Walk’ honoring the 2-year-old pooch.
