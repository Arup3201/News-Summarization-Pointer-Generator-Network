Two 'Wolves of Wall Street' funded a multi-millionaire's lifestyle by masterminding an elaborate scam which encouraged British investors to buy £60million of worthless shares.

Australian Jeffrey Revel-Reade, 49, from Dursley, Gloucestershire, and Anthony May, 58, from South Norwood, south London, orchestrated the complex boiler room scam from their base in Madrid, Spain.

The deception - similar to the type orchestrated by Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfont, played by Leonardo di Caprio in the Hollywood film - allowed the fraudsters to live a life of luxury, with yachts, private jets and a huge portfolio of plush mansions across the world.

The 'exceptionally talented' duo shamelessly splurged on vintage wine collections, top of the range cars and two prized Rolf Harris paintings - worth £72,970 - after duping the investors.

Father-of-two Revel-Reade spent
 £13,000 on Rolex watches alone, as well as £54,000 on sports cars and 
motorbikes.

He also
 owned a $2million luxury flat in Melbourne, Australia, three apartments
 in Marbella, Spain - which were worth more than 3million euros - and had four mansions
 in Wimbledon, south west London, including one worth £5million.

After a three-month trial at Southwark Crown Court, Revel-Reade and May were jailed for nine years and six months and seven years six months respectively for conspiracy to defraud.

During the trial, the jury heard how the pair executed the scam by enlisting a team of salesmen who used high pressure sales techniques to trick vulnerable victims.

Last year six of those salesmen were convicted of conspiracy to defraud and jailed almost 30 years in total.

The scam was similar to the type orchestrated by Jordan Belfont, played by Leonardo di Caprio in the Wolf of Wall Street

Their convictions can now be revealed after reporting restrictions were lifted.

All six defendants, who persuaded the punters to invest, were convicted of conspiring to 
defraud investors by dishonestly making, causing or permitting false 
representations between March 2003 and August 2007.

The court was told one of the victims, veteran Roger Carr, has been left 'isolated' after the hoax and now only has his 'small army pension' on which to survive.

Another victim Rosemary Howard invested her £200,000 life sayings in the fraudulent scheme to try and fund care for her elderly disabled mother - who is in her 90s and wheelchair bound.

During the latest trial, judge Michael Gledhill QC said the effects the scam had on the victims were 'catastrophic'.

He told them: 'The investors' losses amounted to many millions of dollars.

'Most of those investors have lost every penny. The consequences for all of them, both financially and psychologically, have been dreadful and in some cases catastrophic.

'The salesman were very successful in pressuring investors to buy these shares by using a combination of devices - lying, making false representations, using high pressure sales techniques, befriending those who were elderly or vulnerable through loneliness and making threats and bullying.'

Judge Gledhill described them as intelligent and 'exceptionally talented' men.

The pair spent their money on luxury items, such as private jets, mansions around the world and designer clothes and goods

He said: 'You are both men with 
exceptional talents, highly intelligent and astute, both capable of 
making a large amount of money from hard work but unfortunately you 
decided there was far more money to be made from fraud.

Revel-Reade was extradited from Australia while May was brought back from Spain to face criminal proceedings.

A third defendant, solicitor John 
Manning, 65, was allegedly recruited to provide a 'veneer of 
respectability', but was cleared of corruption.

Prosecutor Stuart Trimmer QC said: 'This was grand deception on a global scale.

'Simply, this was greed on a vast scale, dressed up in the language of business, hidden behind layers of corporate disguise.

'The investors were told, whatever it took to persuade them, to buy the shares that the conspirators had on the shelf to sell.

'They were not stockbrokers but they set up an elaborate facade that looked and sounded, to the would-be investor, like real professional stockbrokers.

'Their purpose was, in reality, not to provide a service but to sell their "stock" and simply to make as much money as possible.'

Revel-Reade was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud but cleared of another charge of corruption.

May, a father-of-two whose family lives in Switzerland, was convicted of conspiracy to defraud.

Manning, from Alwoodley, Leeds, West Yorksire, was acquitted of corruption.

Judge Gledhill continued: 'Everyone involved in this fraud made a great deal of money.

The two men were jailed collectively for 17 years after a trial at Southwark Crown Court

'Madrid salesmen enjoyed a luxury lifestyle driving top of the range vehicles, expensive holidays and investing in property.

'From your proceeds you invested substantial amounts to be put to your wife and children's school fees and provide goods.

'You were able to rent and own properties in England, Spain and Austria. You had ready money to travel the world.'

From the previous case, the defendants were Daniel Gooding, 39, and Emma 
Farmer, 40, both from Brentwood, Essex; Jon Emery, 36, from Romford, Essex; Ian Hughes, 33, from Cardiff; Philip Morris, from Ashford, Kent and Shaun 
Rumsey, 33, from Dunmow, Essex.

Gooding was jailed for seven years, while Rumsey, Emery and Morris received a five-year jail term.

Hughes was locked up for four years, while Farmer was handed a three-year prison term.
