Nicolas Sarkozy has placed the scrapping of France’s gay marriage laws at the centre of his bid to be re-elected as the country’s President.

In hugely controversial comments made on Saturday, the 59-year-old politician confirmed he would ‘repeal’ Socialist legislation allowing same-sex unions.

This is despite Mr Sarkozy’s third wife, the former model and pop singer Carla Bruni, being a huge supporter of homosexuals marrying and adopting children.

Nicolas Sarkozy speaking at the the 'Sens Commun' meeting in Paris on Saturday said that he would scrap France's gay marriage laws as part of his bid to be re-elected as the country's President

Mr Sarkozy was pressed on the issue during a debate in Paris between the three candidates hoping to lead the conservative UMP party into the 2017 presidential election.

He said the May 2013 law which legalised gay adoption ‘should be written from the ground up’.

The predominantly right-wing audience chanted ‘Repeal! Repeal!’, and Mr Sarkozy said: ‘If you prefer that I say repeal the law, it comes down to the same thing.’

Mr Sarkozy did nothing for homosexuals who wanted to marry during his single term as President between 2007 and 2012.

The vast majority of French people are at least nominally Catholic, and there has been huge opposition to President Francois Hollande’s liberal social policies.

However, an Ifop poll published on Saturday showed 68 per cent of the French were in favour of same-sex unions.

It also showed that 53 per cent of the country supported adoption by homosexual couples.

Pressed about such contentious issues last year, Ms Bruni said: ‘I’m rather in favor because I have a lot of friends - men and women - who are in this situation and I see nothing unstable or perverse in families with gay parents.”

Ms Bruni added: ‘My husband is opposed for reasons linked to his political vocation, because he sees people as groups of thousands rather than people we know personally.’

Despite facing a long list of corruption enquiries, Mr Sarkozy is convinced he can become head of state again in three years.

He has increasingly placed himself to the right of the political agenda, mainly in response to the increasing success of the far-right National Front.
