In China there is a place where it's Christmas every day.

But this is not because everyone gets to open presents brought by Santa Claus all year round – it's more much commercial than that.  

Two hours by train from Shanghai lies the market town of Yiwu in Zhejiang province. A holiday shopper’s paradise, it is filled with storefront vendors selling all manner of small commodities, but it's biggest business is Christmas.

The International Business Times reported the stalls at Yiwu's indoor market is overflowing with trees, lights, decorations, tinsel, bows and just about everything connected to the festive season. Unlike the rest of the world, it’s almost a year-round business for Yiwu Christmas market vendors.

It's so large that the market will take more than a day to walk around, and to say that the traders here sell in bulk is an understatement.

According to a report by Chinese website Sina News, Yiwu produces about 60 per cent of the world’s Christmas decorations and more than 90 percent of China’s Christmas decorations.

For other Christmas decoration factories and retailers in China, Christmas starts as early as July and ends in late September, when massive orders from around the world flood in.

Yiwu is considered a bellwether for China's low-cost exports, especially exports destined for emerging markets, reported Reuters. 

Orders come from places as far away as Europe, the United States and South America. This year however, European demand for Christmas goods has dropped sharply, local vendors said. One estimated European orders were down 20 percent from last year, while another said his European orders had fallen by 40 percent.

According to Sina, the vice chairman for the Yiwu Christmas Products Industry Association, Cai Qingliang, said that although overseas sales have dwindled this year, domestic orders have increased.

“I sell Christmas trees from March to December,” a shopkeeper with the surname Ji, told CNN. “Most customers buy 3,000 (yuan) to 4,000 yuan trees.”

China may not celebrate Christmas in the religious or traditional sense, but towns like Yiwu can make the most out of it from a business point of view. 

“The market is the town,” said another vendor, who gave her name as He. “Other towns are far away. It takes time for products to get there. Here, it’s always Christmas.”

While for some Yiwu factory workers, the whole idea of Christmas is lost on them. 

“Maybe it’s the [Chinese] New Year for foreigners,” 19-year-old Wei, a local worker, told CNN. 

Wei and his father work in the factory together, contributing to Christmas by making plastic snowflakes for about 10 hours a day, every day. 

And even though Wei’s father wears a Santa hat to work  it protects his hair from the red dye that consumes the factory – he doesn’t plan on celebrating the holiday.
