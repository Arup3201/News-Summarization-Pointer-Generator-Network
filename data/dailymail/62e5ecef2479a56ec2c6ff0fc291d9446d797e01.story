Australia's largest telecommunications company is set to send almost 700 jobs offshore to Asia.

As part of its plans to expand in the region, from September of this year Telstra will outsource 671 Australian roles to its industry partners.

Telstra confirmed to the ABC that it will cut the jobs from it's Global Services Division.

In a bid to increase resources in its global division, over the next 12 months 463 internal positions and 208 contractor roles will be outsourced.

Chief executive David Thodey recently outlined Telstra's vision to become a major company in Asia, offering wireless technology and software.

'To compete effectively internationally we need to have resources in the region and the capability to scale rapidly to meet demand," the company said in a statement on Wednesday.

'These are not decisions we take lightly and we will consult and work closely with our people on this proposal.

'If a decision is made to proceed we will aim to redeploy as many affected employees as possible.'

Staff were shocked and saddened by the news, Community and Public Sector Union President Michael Tull told said.

'Telstra is moving into a very worrying phase of offshoring,' he told AAP.

'The affected area is a very profitable and growing part of the business, so it's shocking to see that Telstra is prepared to outsource its future.'
