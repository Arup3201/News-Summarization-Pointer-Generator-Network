Father and daughter: Cate Edwards has given an interview in which she discusses the harrowing past 20-odd-years of her family's life and how she and her father, John Edwards (both pictured here during his trial in 2012) are now moving on as business partners together

The daughter of John Edwards has revealed her father summoned her to the family's palatial North Carolina mansion to confess his affair - while his cancer-stricken wife Elizabeth was waiting, 'elsewhere in the house'.

Meeting her in the library of his multi-million dollar Chapel Hill estate in the summer of 2007, or 2008, the disgraced politician sat his Ivy-league educated eldest daughter down and admitted he had cheated on her mother.

'It was important from dad's perspective to be honest with me,' Cate Edwards said to The Washington Post magazine in an interview to celebrate her new partnership with her father on his successful return to practicing law.

'He was very emotional in telling me...We hugged and I said, 'I love you'. That's generally how it went. He was, he was upset,' said Cate, about her father who recently won $13 million in a personal injury case for his client.

However, worse was to come and in August 2008, the news emerged that Edwards had fathered a child with his one-time aide, Rielle Hunter and his campaign to become president imploded - as did his marriage to Elizabeth, after Christmas, one year later.

On December 7, 2010, days after Cate, now 32, was engaged to her college sweetheart Tevor Upham, her mother passed away after battling cancer for almost six years.

In 2012 her father came close to prison during his trial on charges of violating campaign finance laws, but Cate stood by him.

She stood by him even after the revelation during that trial of the harrowing moment her mother ripped open her blouse to show Edwards her breast cancer surgery scars after The National Enquirer first reported his affair in October 2007.

However, despite the tumultuous past ten years of her family's lives, Cate told The Washington Post that nothing would ever compare to the death of her older brother, Wade, in 1996.

Her family life up until that moment was perfect. Her father was a millionaire trial lawyer in Raleigh - a champion of the disenfranchised and poor.

Her mother, Elizabeth, was a successful attorney too. The Edwards were golden in every way.

Then, one spring weekend when Cate was 14 a state trooper knocked on the door and told the family that her brother had died in a freak car accident.

'I remember my dad collapsing,' said Cate to The Washington Post. 'He fell, not just fainted. He just sort of collapsed. He was inconsolable.'

Cate recalls her parents falling apart in the aftermath of their eldest son's death. So much so that Cate moved into their bedroom to console them.

Indeed, friends of Cate told The Washington Post that anyone's shock at the support John Edwards receives from his daughter, needs to understand this time in their lives.

'For them, the worst had already happened,' says Sunjung Kim, Cate’s roommate for four years at Princeton.

'Everything that came after was just something to be dealt with.'

Close: Cate Edwards told The Washington Post magazine that she felt angry towards her father because of the hurt he caused her mother, Elizabeth, pictured.

Cate told The Washington Post that she wouldn't discuss her mother and father's marriage but that Wade's death was integral to her relationship with her father.

'I’m really not going to get into their relationship,' said Cate.

Affair: Rielle Hunter and daughter, Frances Quinn Hunter. John Edwards infidelity has not meant that Cate Edwards does not see her half-sister. However, Cate has no relationship with Rielle

'In terms of my relationship with the two of them, when you’ve been through the things we’ve been through together, this wasn’t like losing Wade. It was not as bad.

'It was hard in its own way. It had its own beats. It was difficult. We had been through a lot together and over a long period of time. So there was repairing that needed to happen, but it’s not like I felt like it was a relationship that was lost.'

Elizabeth and John decided to have more children and two years after his son's death, John Edwards won the 1998 election to the Senate.

He ran alongside John Kerry as vice-president on the defeated 2004 Democratic ticket and then just two days after that in November, Elizabeth was diagnosed with cancer.

Then, fatefully, on February 21, 2006, Rielle Hunter walked into the bar at Lowes Regency Hotel in New York and saw John Edwards telling him, 'You're so hot!'

Their disastrous affair was discovered by Elizabeth in December 20006, but at the time and prior to The National Enquirer revelations, Edwards told his cancer-stricken wife it was a one-night stand.

Tragedy: Former Democratic vice presidential nominee  John Edwards, his children Jack (C) and Cate (R) leave the church after the funeral for Elizabeth Edwards in Raleigh, North Carolina December 11, 2010

The fortunes of the Edwards spiraled until they reached a head on the day of John Edwards' verdict in 2012.

Having escaped jail through a hung jury, Cate stood beside her father and let it be known she was standing by her disgraced father.

Now, six months after Cate joined forces to create the Edwards Kirby law firm, they are looking to the future.

'I had my moments of self-pity,' she told The Washington Post.

'I’ve never reacted with anger exactly. I mean, you know I was angry at my dad for a while. We worked on, we worked very hard to repair our relationship.

'That’s always a secondary emotion for me; it’s never my primary emotion. ... I’ve gotten a great education and had wonderful friends and blessed with parents who love me and great siblings, and it’s hard to ignore those blessings. 

Focal point: The death of Wade Edwards in 1996 bonded Cate, her father and mother in a way that only those who have gone through something similar can appreciate according to her friends

Happier days: In 2011 Cate Edwards married - moving her life on in light of her recent tragedies

'Bad things can happen to you, but it’s not that they overwhelm you when you recognize the blessings you have and the people you have, because that’s always what gets you through that sadness and those difficult times. And I had Trevor, too.'

Admitting she has no relationship with Rielle, Cate does see her half-sister, Frances Quinn, who is six-years-old.

Indeed, in April, Cate and her father were turned away when he tried to get into socialite Bunny Mellon's funeral in Virginia.

The financial relationship between the disgraced politician and the reclusive heiress nearly twice his age was made public during the former Senator's 2011 trial which delved into the alleged misuse of the hundreds of thousands of dollars that Mellon gave to Edward's campaign.

Her money was largely used to cover up the extramarital affair he had with Rielle Hunter and their love child.

Dream over: Despite his loss on the 2004 Democrat ticket with John Kerry (pictured) John Edwards was seen by many as a future president of the United States

Though he was found not guilty of illegally using the more than $700,000 Mellon donated, he has apparently not won back the support of the now-deceased socialite's family.

Bunny, whose real name was Rachel Lambert Mellon, died from natural causes on March 17 at the age of 103.

The New York Post reports that Edwards showed up to Mellon's funeral in Upperville, Virginia on Friday with his eldest daughter Cate but they were given the cold shoulder.

When they arrived, they were kept out of the service at Trinity Episcopal Church and forced to stand in an adjacent parish with the rest of the overflow crowd.

They were able to watch actor Frank Langella give the eulogy and Bette Midler sing 'The Rose' but only from a live stream projection on a big screen.

'The service may have been open to the public, but he was not welcome,' NY Social Diary blogger David Patrick Columbia told The Post.
