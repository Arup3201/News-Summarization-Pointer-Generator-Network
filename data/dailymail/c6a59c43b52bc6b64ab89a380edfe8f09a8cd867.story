The British mother being held in Indonesia on suspicion of drugs trafficking has told how she fears for her six-year-old daughter's life.

Rachel Dougall is currently receiving treatment in hospital for stress after collapsing in her jail cell, claiming she hadn't 
'slept or eaten for days'. She has been sedated and is being fed through
a drip.

She, along with three other Britons including her partner Julian Ponder, face the death penalty after being arrested on suspicion of trying to smuggle cocaine worth £1.6 million.

Depressed: Dougall was moved to hospital after refusing to eat 
and constantly calling out for her six-year-old daughter Kitty

Police
believe Dougall, 38, and Ponder, 43, were the 
lynchpins in a crime syndicate supplying the drug to rich tourists on 
the Indonesian island of Bali.  If convicted, they could be sentenced to death by firing squad.

Dougall's six-year-old daughter Kitty, is currently being cared for by the family's maid and her gardening husband, although Dougall's parents are believed to be flying out from Britain.

Speaking from her guarded room at Bali's Trijata Hospital, Dougall appeared frail and confused as she asked if the story was in British newspapers.

When she was told it was, she said she feared for her daughter Kitty’s life.

Propping herself up on her elbow, she said: 'Oh my god, is my daughter safe?

'I am afraid for my daughter's life.

‘I am sick. I am suffering from stress. My mother and father are arriving.’

A Bali police spokesperson earlier confirmed officers had been forced to stop questioning Ms Dougall temporarily due to her bad health.

'We don't interrogate sick people,' he said. 'It will be against their human rights. We will be waiting until she is healthy again and then we will continue the questions.'

Problems: Ms Dougall is now believed to be seeing a psychiatrist in hospital

Starved: Reports have said she did not eat anything for more than five days

Dougall has consistently protested her innocence since her arrest, insisting she was the victim of a 'fit-up'.

The four suspects were held in a sting operation after British housewife Lindsay Sandiford, 55, was allegedly caught with 4.8kg of cocaine stuffed in the lining of a suitcase after being stopped at Bali's Denpasar airport after she arrived from Bangkok on May 19.

Customs officials allegedly found 10.3lb of cocaine wrapped in pink gift paper.

Bali’s head of Customs, Mr Made Wijaya, said: ‘It was stupid. There had been no attempt to conceal it.’

He
claimed that Sandiford had previously met up with Dougall in a 
Bangkok airport cafe. She had been given a sim card for her mobile phone and that Sandiford made a ‘dry run’ a few days before she was found with the drugs.

He
said: ‘She came into Bali on  May 5 and left a few days later. Then she
came in on May 19, which is when she was arrested. I believe she only 
did this because she was forced to.’

Drugs: Lindsay Sandiford was allegedly caught with 4.8kg of cocaine stuffed in the lining of a suitcase as she arrived on the island

Referring to Dougall, he said: ‘She ordered the drugs. She organised this. Rachel was telling Lindsay what to do. Rachel made the first contact with Lindsay.’

It is believed Sandiford decided to co-operate with the police over a £1 bowl of chilli fried rice.

They told her she would face the death penalty unless she helped trap the other suspected members of the drugs gang.

A sting was set up allowing Sandiford to keep the drugs 
with her in a £25-a-night hotel room, where she was accompanied by an 
undercover police officer while she waited to be contacted by one of the
others in the alleged syndicate.

Police claim Ponder turned up at the hotel while another Briton, Paul 
Beales, whom they believe was the gang’s ‘muscle’, waited nearby.

Ponder has alleged that he was set up by Sandiford as he went to pick up a birthday present for his daughter.

Dougall
and Ponder's plush Bali villa was built on 17,222 sq ft of land bought in 
2009 — the year after Mr Ponder’s UK-based party-organising business was
liquidated with huge debts.

The
luxurious property is worth at least $300,000 (£195,000) on the local 
market — a small fortune in Indonesia, where the minimum wage is about 
£100 a month.

It
is located in the village of Desa Belalang in Tabanan, about an hour’s 
drive from Bali’s main tourist areas. The couple began living here with 
their daughter a few months ago. The couple are also believed to own a property in Cyprus.

The Foreign Office said British officials were helping Dougall's daughter as well as the arrested Britons.

A spokesman said it did not have any information regarding the reports that Dougall had been taken to hospital.

Family: It is believed Ms Dougall is in a relationship with Mr Ponder and the couple have a little girl Kitty, pictured here in the villa without her parents

Customs
officials have said that Sandiford, originally from Redcar, 
Teesside, may be spared the death sentence because she helped catch 
three other members of the smuggling operation, who could face a firing 
squad.

Police
have 60 days before they have to hand over their files to prosecutors, 
it is believed Sandiford is thought to have told police she only 
agreed to make the smuggling trip because her children in England were 
being threatened.

If
the four are found guilty, they will be transferred to the notorious 
Kerobokan jail, or Hotel K as it is chillingly known, where up to 11 
prisoners at a time are forced to share single cells. There are 
currently 90 inmates awaiting execution at ‘Hotel K.’
