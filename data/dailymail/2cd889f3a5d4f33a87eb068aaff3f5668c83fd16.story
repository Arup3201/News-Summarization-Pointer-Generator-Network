The Courant reports she told police she had been heading to New York's Orange County Airport when the plane's engine lost power.

Air traffic control told her to try landing at the Chester Airport but her plane didn't make it.  

'It was amazing that she not only walked away but she was treated and released from the hospital,' Clinton police Sgt. Jeremiah Dunn told reporters. 'I asked her if she was going to buy a lottery ticket.'

FAA investigation into the crash is ongoing. 

Meanwhile, police were sure to secure the scene of the crash.
