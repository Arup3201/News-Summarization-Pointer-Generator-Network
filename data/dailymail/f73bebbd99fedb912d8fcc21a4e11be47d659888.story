People living near the blaze, at a tyre recycling plant in Sherburn-in-Elmet, were advised to keep their doors and windows closed after the fire was reported to the authorities.

The fire initially required the attention of 14 crews, and it is thought fire fighters will be working on the blaze for 'some days yet'.

North Yorkshire Police said the smoke was heading across the moors and towards the east coast. Because the plume was so high in the sky, police said the risk of harm to the public was low.

But the Yorkshire Ambulance Service said, after the blaze started yesterday morning, that a clinical supervisor and a Hazardous Area Response Team officer were sent to the scene as a precautionary measure.

'We have a full day of flights booked and we're still going up. We had about 10  this morning, about the same this afternoon. We're not allowing student pilots to go up, in case the wind changes direction. If it blows across the airfield, we would have to ground everything.'

The pilot said North Yorkshire Fire Service had told the club the fire may take days to extinguish.

More than a dozen fire crews were sent to tackle the fire, which reached 6,000ft and drifted more than 25 miles
