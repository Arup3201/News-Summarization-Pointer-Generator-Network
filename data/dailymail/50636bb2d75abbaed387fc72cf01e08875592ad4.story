Many people start the New Year hoping to lose weight but when you are the Prime Minister all eyes are on attempts to shed a few pounds.

David Cameron today revealed he has given up bread as part of his 'great patriotic struggle' with his weight, which involves cutting out carbs and running every other day.

The extreme regime means the Premier will have to shelve his breadmaker, which he famously admitted using instead of buying budget loaves.

David Cameron today revealed he has given up bread as part of his 'great patriotic struggle' with his weight, which involves cutting out carbs and running every other day

Mr Cameron decided to embark on a New Year diet after feeling a 'tightening around the belt buckle' over Christmas.

The Prime Minister has now revealed his plan to lose weight depends on cutting out carbohydrates.  

Quizzed about his weight loss today, he told BBC Radio Sussex: 'I’m trying hard, it is a great patriotic struggle.'

He attempted to blame the day job for his struggle, but admitted it was 'feeble'.

'It’s difficult when you’re own the road a lot,' he began. 'This sounds like a feeble excuse.'

Mr Cameron went on: 'I’m trying my hardest, I’m trying to go for a run every other day. I’m trying to cut the intake.'

Pressed on whether his weakness was cake or other sweet treats, Mr Cameron said his 'downfall' was snacking in the middle of the day. 

'That’s the thing you’ve got to cut out isn’t it. I’m giving up the bread, bread’s off. Cut the carbs and go for a run.

'It worked before, maybe it will work again, who knows.'

But he said the being in the public eye meant he had to try to stay trim. 'That’s the trouble... I can’t get away with it because people can judge pretty clearly whether the pounds have come off or gone on.'

The new regime means the Prime Minister won't be able to enjoy toast in the morning when he catches up on the headlines using his iPad

David Cameron is not the only politician to have struggled with his weight.

Tory heavyweight Boris Johnson has admitted tipping the scales at more than 16 stone and a half stone and now needs to cut back 'through guts and determination, by sheer will‎power, by eating less'.

'I have a bad habit of eating the children's supper for breakfast,' the London Mayor revealed.

Tory Chancellor George Osborne and former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond have both used the 5:2 diet to shed the pounds.

But none have come close to Labour peer Lord Falconer who lost five stone thanks to a regime of Diet Coke and apples.

In 2013, he revealed the existence of his breadmaker while being grilled about the rising cost of living. 

Asked to identify a 47p budget loaf, he instead he ended up promoting artisan bread flour made in the Cotswolds, costing five times more than a supermarket brand. 

Four years in power has taken its toll on the waistlines of many members of the Cabinet.

A combination of stress, eating on the go and endless receptions with tempting - but high calorie - canapes means it is all too easy to pile on the pounds.

The Prime Minister has spoken several times about his battle with middle-age spread.

In an interview with Now magazine in 2012 he was asked about his New Year’s resolutions and replied: ‘Probably to lose a bit of weight, I think. That’s the key one for me.’

But today he insisted he never felt like he could not be 'bothered' with the hassle of running the country.

'I’m passionate about this job, it’s a huge honour to do it. I’m putting myself forward for a full term and the British people are my boss and if they want me to do that they’ll vote for me and if they don’t they’ll chuck me out and get somebody else to do the job.

'But it’s an honour to do it. I’m relatively young – at 48. I try to stay relatively fit and healthy.

'I don’t think I’ve gone mad yet although I’m sure that will come.'

The Federation of Bakers, fearing others might follow suit, warned the Prime Minister against giving up bread.

Director Gordon Polson said: 'To David Cameron, and anyone else who is cutting bread from their diet this January in the hope of losing weight, we urge them not to act so fast. 

'Cutting bread from the diet could lead to compromising other essential nutrient intakes, such as fibre, calcium, protein and magnesium. 

'For those keeping fit, such as David Cameron who is a keen runner, starchy foods such as bread are crucial for keeping energy levels up. 

'Not to mention bread is packed full of dietary fibre, keeping you fuller for longer, which could help Mr Cameron resist the temptation of reaching for that mid-afternoon snack or nibbling between meals.'

All politicians fear being asked about the price of a pint of milk or a loaf of bread.

None are struggling to make ends meet and few will notice the price as they - or their spouses - order online or whizz around Waitrose.

In 2013 David Cameron admitted being unsure about how much a supermarket loaf cost, but then compounded the error by revealing he didn't know because he bakes his own using a bread-making machine.

Giving up bread will be a struggle for Mr Cameron who has previously recommended a Panasonic breadmaker and the Cotswold Crunch flour made near his Oxfordshire constituency

The Prime Minister was asked the price of a ‘value’ range loaf after claiming he is not out of touch with ordinary people over the rising cost of living.

He guessed it was more than £1 – in fact it is 47p – then by way of explanation got himself into a deeper hole by saying he does not eat ‘the value stuff’.

Instead he uses a £100 breadmaker and a brand of Cotswolds artisan flour which costs around £4.40 a bag. In comparison a 1.5kg bag of Tesco’s own brand flour costs only 65p. 

Reminded that he was being asked about a value sliced loaf, he said: ‘I don’t buy the value stuff... I’ve got a breadmaker which I delight in using and it turns out in all sorts of different ways.’

He rejected suggestions that making bread at home takes too long, telling LBC radio: ‘You think ahead. A little plug for the flour made in my constituency: The Cotswold Crunch.

'You get some of that – beautifully milled in the Cotswolds – you pop that in your breadmaker.

‘You can set the timer overnight so when you wake up there’s this wonderful smell wafting through your kitchen. It takes 30 seconds to put your ingredients in.’

It is understood the Camerons have the cheapest Panasonic model of breadmaker, which starts at £100.
