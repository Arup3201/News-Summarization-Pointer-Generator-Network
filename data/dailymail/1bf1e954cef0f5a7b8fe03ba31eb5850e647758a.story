Prince Andrew was last night forced to deny he was engaged to a Croatian swimwear model 20 years his junior.

Monika Jakisic, 34, was pictured affectionately kissing the Duke of York goodnight after their third dinner date in as many weeks.

Then yesterday the former girlfriend of actor George Clooney posted a photograph on Twitter of what appeared to be a diamond engagement ring on top of a £600 restaurant bill.

Intimate: Prince Andrew plants a kiss on Monika Jakisic, a model 20- years his junior

Cryptic tweet: The picture of the ring that Monika Jakisic tweeted, causing Prince Andrew to issue a statement denying the couple were engaged

The picture prompted a flurry of calls
 to Buckingham Palace – forcing Andrew’s representatives to issue the 
embarrassing and unprecedented statement last night.

A
 spokesman for the prince, 54, who had hitherto declined to comment on 
speculation about the nature of their relationship, said: ‘I can confirm
 the Duke of York is not engaged to Monika Jakisic.’

Rumours
 of a romantic relationship between the model and royal first emerged 
after they were seen together celebrating the prince’s birthday last 
month at Cecconi’s restaurant in Mayfair, where he was reportedly seen 
kissing her hand and cuddling up to her.

Two
 days later, they were again seen together enjoying an intimate dinner 
at private members’ club The Arts Club in the West End.

Then
 on Thursday evening, Miss Jakisic, who was dressed in skin-tight 
leather trousers and towering Louboutin heels, was seen giving Prince 
Andrew a tender kiss on the cheek outside the Royal Thames Yacht Club in
 Kensington, west London.

Miss Jakisic had arrived separately from 
Andrew at around 8pm. However, they were seen emerging from the club 
together three hours later.

Miss Jakisic was in an on-off relationship with Clooney, 52 from 2004 until last year

A friend of the prince denied there being anything romantic between him and the model

As
 they descended the steps, Andrew held his arm around Miss Jakisic who 
in turn placed her hand on his shoulder. He then watched her leave 
alone.

Last night it emerged
 that the picture she posted on social networking site Twitter of the 
engagement ring and restaurant bill was a congratulations message to two
 friends.

Miss Jakisic, who lives in a £1.2million home in north London, fled war-torn Croatia with her family when she was ten.

Her modelling career took off after she entered a competition run by Storm, the agency which represents Kate Moss.

Standing 5ft10 tall, she now refers to herself as the ‘Croatian sensation’

On
 Twitter, she has posted photos of herself in bikinis, and says she is 
‘spiritual humanitarian’ with a ‘wild sense of humour’ who loves to stay
 fit by boxing. 

She was in
 an on-off relationship with Clooney, 52, from 2004 until last year. 
Last week, a friend of the prince’s denied any romance between Andrew 
and Miss Jakisic, adding she ‘only joined Andrew and a group of friends 
at the end of the evening’.

A senior royal aide also attempted to quash the speculation last night, saying: ‘They are friends.

He has known her for a number of years – over a decade – and to say that they are more than friends would be incorrect.’

Before marrying Sarah  Ferguson, Prince Andrew had a string of glamorous lovers, including actress  Koo Stark.

And
 since divorcing in 1996, he has been linked to a string of models 
including South African Heather Mann and Playboy Bunny Denise Martell.
