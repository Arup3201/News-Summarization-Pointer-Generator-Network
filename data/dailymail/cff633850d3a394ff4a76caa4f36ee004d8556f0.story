A controversial British artist called Madame Allsorts has released a new clothing range that is designed to shock - it uses double-entendres with well-known faces and objects from pop-culture - pictured is her Last Supper custom-made dress £850 

The Last Supper print is one of Madame Allsorts' most popular creations. The picture features some of the world's most controversial celebrities, including Kanye West, Karl Lagerfeld, Miley Cyrus, Paris Hilton and Terry Richardson  

One of the line's most popular items is the Last Supper dress, featuring some of the most controversial celebrities of our time, including Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, Terry Richardson, Kanye West, Cara Delevingne, Robin Thicke, Paris Hilton and Karl Lagerfield, Anna Wintour. 

There is also a 'Manipulated Reality' T-shirt and jacket featuring Kim Kardashian and Kanye West dressed up as Adam And Eve, being filmed by TV cameras. 

One Direction fans might have found the one piece of merchandise they don't want in their collection - there is an 'Immaculate Conception' nativity scene where Simon Cowell takes on the part of Joseph, holding a baby Jesus in the form of Harry Styles. 

The picture also includes an appearance from Sinitta, who has her modesty protected in the form of palm leaves - similar to her appearance in the judges' houses section of X Factor back in 2009. 

The 'C*** Dog' jacket retails at £395 

A scarf with the 'Manipulated Reality' print features Kim Kardashian and Kanye West dressed up as Adam And Eve, being filmed by TV cameras. It retails at £75 

For those just wanting to shock and offend without the showbiz references, Madame Allsorts has also designed a range of dresses, jackets and jumpers featuring apples in the shape of vaginas and hot-dogs shaped like penises. 

 She said: 'Every one of my garments has a message and agenda. As I fabricate the garment, I’m capturing a moment.

'I’ve designed these collections to rally against the mainstream and shatter fashion’s narrow ideals, to celebrate difference.'

The x-rated apple sweatshirt costs £60  

Madame Allsorts (pictured) says that each of the garments she designs has a message and an agenda 

She continued: 'I value fashion, but for the opposite reasons of consumer society - not because it helps its wearer fit in, paying for somebody else's restrictive perspective of what’s cool. 

'I do it because it helps them stand out and express their own thoughts, opinions and tastes.'
