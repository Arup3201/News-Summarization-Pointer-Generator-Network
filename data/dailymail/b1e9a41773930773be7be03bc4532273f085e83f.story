A police community support officer has raised her superiors' eyebrows after posting photographs of herself posing in her underwear on Facebook.

Brunette Rebecca Morris, 29, works as a PCSO for West Midlands Police patrolling the beat in Dudley.

But she also strips off her uniform and models at car shows in her spare time.

The curvy community support officer has posted dozens of shots of herself posing in her underwear on her Facebook page.

In one picture, tattooed Ms Morris - who describes herself as a 'public figure' on the social networking site - sits down in front of a blue Volkswagen Golf.

Another photo shows the officer sporting a thigh-high black mini-skirt while she stares seductively at the camera.

She has also posted images of herself kneeling up on a double bed wearing a black nightie.

The aspiring model also has her own website where she advertises her services as a model in Germany.

Colleagues at Brierley Hill Police Station have expressed shock at her sideline in modelling.

One officer said: 'Everyone knows Rebecca is a good-looking girl but it’s not very professional to post half-naked pictures of yourself on Facebook when you are patrolling the beat and preventing crimes.

'I don’t think the bosses are aware of her sideline - if they did I’m sure they’d insist she took the pictures off Facebook.'

Ms Morris is on the neighbourhood policing team for Brockmoor and Pensnett in Dudley.

Her father today confirmed she works as a PCSO and poses for the modelling shots.

Speaking from her home in Quinton, West Midlands, he said: 'All girls do that kind of thing.'

West Midlands Police today reminded its officers that they are 'accountable' for pictures they post on social networking sites.

Chief Inspector Julian Harper, from West Midlands Police’s Professional Standards Department, said: 'All officers and staff in West Midlands Police are advised that when they contribute to social networking sharing websites they should also take into consideration the fact they will be placing personal details into the public domain which may impact on their own privacy.

'They are accountable for whatever they put into the public domain and may be subject to misconduct procedures should there be any inappropriate use of social media.

'We have looked into the matter and found no cause for further action or comment. We will not confirm or refute the identity sought as it would breach privacy and data protection laws.'
