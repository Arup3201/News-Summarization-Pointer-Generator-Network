A house dating back to the early 1700s once lived in by the 'real Robinson Crusoe' has gone up for sale.

Minards House in Oreston, Plymouth, Devon, is said to have once been lived in by Alexander Selkirk, who experts believe is the man behind the fictional castaway.

Written by Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe follows the life of a wealthy adventurer as he voyages around the world and eventually ends up shipwrecked.

The plaque outside the property was one of several put up during the 1970s denoting Plymouth's link to the ambitious wayfarer Alexander Selkirk

Dr Bonnie Latimer, a lecturer in English at Plymouth University, said: 'What many may not realise is that the original novel isn't entirely fiction.

'One of his likely sources was the Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk's story of being deliberately abandoned on the island of Juan Fernandez by his ship's captain after they argued.

'Selkirk only lived on his island for four years, but when rescued by a passing ship, he is supposed to have presented a wild figure, sunburnt, bearded, and clothed in goats' skins - just like Crusoe himself.'

In the early eighteenth century Minards House was a pub, and Selkirk supposedly stayed there for some time before heading out to sea again on HMS Weymouth, and subsequently dying of yellow fever.

Donna Pullinger, who moved into the four-bedroom, detached house 12 years ago, said: 'There's a plaque on the house, and I've got some old documents.

'In a book someone gave me it says he stayed here. I've also got all the old deeds.

'We get quite a few people standing outside and peering in.

'I'd love to go back in time and see what it would have been like then.'

The plaque outside the property was one of several put up during the 1970s denoting Plymouth's link to the ambitious wayfarer. The house is on the market for £395,000.

A spokesman for Plymouth City Council said: 'Selkirk came to Plymouth aboard HMS Enterprise in October 1720 and subsequently transferred to HMS Weymouth.

'Between ships, on December 12 1720, he married local widow Frances Candish at St Andrew's Church. 

Frances is thought to be the landlady of an Oreston pub where he may have lodged - the Old Inn - along the quay from the Kings Arms.

The house is a 'substantial older property' close to the site of Oreston's original quayside

'Most waterfront properties of the period have long gone.

'The plaque is on "Minards House" - a substantial older property close to the site of the Old Inn and original quayside.'

Dr Latimer said: 'After Selkirk returned to Britain, in 1712 his rescuer published an account based on Selkirk's experiences.

'This caught the public imagination, and was reproduced in cheap, accessible formats for the common reader, with Selkirk himself becoming a minor celebrity.

'In the end, though, this exciting adventure didn't much change Selkirk from the rough-and-tumble sailor he was.

'He returned to sea, stopping at Plymouth on a voyage home in 1720, where he probably married and lived for a short time.

'The lure of the water was too strong for him, however, and the following year he returned to his ship, dying at sea in 1721.

There is some debate over whether Selkirk ever met Daniel Defoe, but the sailor is understood to have been behind the character Robinson Crusoe

'But his story, transfigured through the imagination of Daniel Defoe, would immortalise his life for thousands of readers around the world, and means that he is still remembered nearly 300 years after his death.'

However, Nicholas Seager, a university lecturer and Defoe scholar, said: 'There is some debate about whether Defoe ever encountered Selkirk, but in short there is no proof that he did, so it's safest to assume he did not.

'And we should recognise that Defoe did not simply base Robinson Crusoe on Selkirk; he adapted and supplemented the source.

'There are many other literary sources for Crusoe, but this real-life one surely had an impact.'

Mrs Pullinger said: 'When we moved in we put a lot of the character back in, as the staircase was horrid and modern, and we also put slates on the floor and put in a wood burner - so it's more like it would've been back then.

'It's a lovely house and I will miss it but I'd love to stay in the village.'

Written by Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe is the story of a castaway and his adventures on a remote tropical island near Trinidad.

First published in 1719, the novel recounts Crusoe's experiences on the desert island including his battle to stay alive and his encounters with cannibals, captives and mutineers.

The story is widely believed to have been influenced by the life of Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, who was a castaway on an island in the Pacific off Chile for four years.

Others have suggested he was inspired by a separate novel about a desert island castaway. Some say it was inspired by Robert Knox's account of his abduction by the King of Ceylon in 1659

In the book, Crusoe sets sail from Hull on a sea voyage in 1651 against the wishes of his parents who want him to go into law

He eventually ends up shipwrecked in a storm 40 miles out to sea on an island, which he calls Despair, near the mouth of the Orinoco river in 1659.

It is thought the details of Crusoe's island were probably based on the Caribbean island of Tobago, since that island lies a short distance north of the Venezuelan coast near the mouth of the river.

He fetches arms, tools, and other supplies from the ship before it breaks apart and sinks and builds a home near a cave which he excavates and makes marks in a wooden cross as a makeshift calendar. 

Over the years, Crusoe discovers native cannibals who visit occasionally to kill and eat prisoners.

When one of the prisoners escapes, he teaches him English and names him 'Friday' after the day of the week he arrived.

Eventually, Crusoe escapes on an English ship before embarking for England in 1686 with Friday.
