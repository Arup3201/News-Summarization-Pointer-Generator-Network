A newborn girl who was snatched by a woman dressed as a nurse was quickly tracked down thanks to some quick-thinking young people. 

Day-old baby Victoria was grabbed from the maternity ward at Trois-Rivieres in Quebec, Canada on Monday night.  Terrified parents Mélissa McMahon and Simon Boisclair, contacted authorities after becoming suspicious when a woman dressed as a nurse walked away with their baby. An Amber Alert was quickly issued.

The alert featured a photo of the suspect, dressed in red hospital scrubs, on hospital surveillance footage around 7pm and soon afterwards, in a red Toyota Yaris with a Baby On Board sign.

Fortunately, the Amber Alert was seen on Facebook by a group of young friends - Charlène Plante, Mélizanne Bergeron, Charel Bergeron and Marc-André Côté - one of whom, Miss Plante, identified the suspect as a former neighbor.

In under 30 minutes, they drove to the woman's home and saw the same car parked outside - and the woman inside with the baby, according to The Globe And Mail.

The friends then contacted the police and the little girl was rescued - around 30 minutes after the alert was issued.

The 21-year-old suspect was arrested and is now being monitored in hospital.

Ms McMahon said that she knew something was wrong after she saw the 'nurse' walk off with her baby in her arms.

The new mother ran to the hospital entrance but could see no sign of her baby or the woman.

Ms McMahon, a shop assistant whose partner is a firefighter, wrote on Facebook: 'Four 
marvellous people, that we had a chance to meet, identified the woman 
thanks to Facebook.

'It’s the only reason why Victoria is in our arms 
right now. Our thanks to all Quebeckers who made an extra efforts.'

She also warned new mothers not to be so trusting of anyone wearing a hospital uniform.

Ms Bergeron, a nursing student, told The Globe And Mail that it was a big relief to find the baby safe and well.
