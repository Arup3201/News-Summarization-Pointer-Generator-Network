A huge graffiti mural saying 'NYPD KILLS' was daubed on the Manhattan Bridge in the wake of protests over the death of Eric Garner.

The stark message, daubed on the New York City landmark, took up the cry of anti-police protesters, who routinely accuse officers of murder on their marches.

Police are investigating the graffiti, which insiders at the embattled force have described as 'a slap in the face'.

Strong: The message appeared on the lower south side of the Manhattan Bridge on Friday, but was removed

The message, which was on the south side of the bridge, has since been removed by government officials, according to the New York Post.

Investigators reportedly found fingerprints at the scene and are investigating the identities of potential culprits.

It coincided with a clash of pro- and anti-police demonstrators in who took to the city last night. Supporters of the NYPD appeared to mock Eric Garner by wearing t-shirts reading 'I CAN breathe' - an inversion of his dying words.

Anti-police protesters adopted the phrase 'I can't breathe' as a rallying call in reference to the moment officer Daniel Pantaleo killed father-of-six Garner in a chokehold.

But on Friday night, 100 people hit back at the demonstrations outside City Hall in the controversial customized clothing and confronted anti-cop protesters.

Controversial: More than 100 people sported these t-shirts to confront demonstrators on Friday night

Twist: The customized shirts twisted Eric Garner's last words, 'I can't breathe', to read 'I can breathe'

Facing off against the 200 people crying for justice for Eric Garner, they shouted: 'don't resist arrest'.

It comes after an Indiana police officer caused outraged offering t-shirts for sale with the legend 'Breathe Easy: Don't break the law' on the front.

The t-shirts were produced by Corporal Jason Barthel of the City of Mishawaka Police in Indiana who owns and operates the South Bend Uniform Company.

The t-shirts, which cost from $7.95 are seen as a play on the final words of Eric Garner who died after being restrained by the New York Police Department.

Faced off: The police supporters shouted 'don't resist arrest' every time the others shouted their slogans

Anger: The anti-Eric Garner protests claimed they were promoting lawful behavior

Deep-rooted issues: The failure to indict officer Daniel Pantaleo revealed severe racial divisions in New York 

'Above the law': The crowds slammed police officers for exploiting their role 

Garner, who was restrained in a choke-hold after he was spotted selling individual cigarettes in Staten Island told officers 'I can't breathe', before slipping into unconsciousness.

Corporal Barthel said criticism of his t-shirts is misunderstood. 

He said on his company's Facebook page: 'For those upset, please understand when we use the slogan "Breathe Easy" we are referring to knowing the police are there for you! 

'We are one people, one nation regardless of race, religion, creed or gender. We are all in this together. The police are here to protect and serve. 99.9% of us have the greater good in our hearts each time we strap on our uniforms and duty belts. 

'We are all one people and this is by no means is a slam on Eric Garner or his family, God rest his soul. Lets all band together as AMERICANS regardless of our feelings and know we can and will be better! Thank you for your support.'

Other basketball stars such as Kobe Bryant, centre, have also donned the t-shirt supporting civil rights 

It is understood that more than 100 of the t-shirts have so far been sold online. 

The 'I can't breathe' slogan has been used widely across America since Mr Garner's death last month. 

A number of celebrities, including basketball star LeBron James have worn t-shirt with the slogan. 

South Bend District Council President Oliver Davis told the New York Daily News: 'We believe that people should be able to breathe easy no matter what they're doing. Police should not take the right to breathe into their own hands.' 

Commenting on the controversial t-shirt, Mr Davis said: 'It has a strong message to people to let them know that justice is not fair. People need the right to be able to breathe easy no matter where we are in life and the justice system should be the ones to deal with that, not just the police officers.' 

Adam Duckworth posted on the company's Facebook page criticising the t-shirt. He said: 'This company exploits death, tragedy and ignorance for profit and publicity under the guise of supporting local law enforcers. 

'Contrary to the implications of their merchandise, DEATH DOES NOT = JUSTICE. If you bought the "breathe easy" shirt, you are basically agreeing that appropriate use of force when dealing with any and all petty criminals and even remotely "suspicious" people is to skirt the justice system entirely via immediate deployment of the death penalty.'
