Speculation is rife that billionaire Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is the mystery buyer of Apple's first ever computer.

The basic Apple 1 machine was the 46th of 50 that Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak built together in Jobs' bedroom at his parents house - and one of only 11 still existing.

The computer, described as the best Apple 1 in the world, sold for £206,000 at an auction.

Auctioneers are being tight lipped on the identity of the buyer but revealed it was a 'young CEO of an American company similar to Apple.'

They said the buyer felt he was in a similar situation to Jobs and Wozniak, who catapulted Apple from humble beginnings to the world's most valuable brand.

The device was being sold by an American computer enthusiast who had owned it for 30 years.

Sold along with it was a remarkable 1976 photo showing the 50 Apple 1s stacked up in boxes in Jobs' bedroom, representing the humble beginnings of the Apple empire.

Uwe Breker, from auctioneers Team Breker in Cologne, Germany, said: 'We were expecting this Apple 1 to go for a bit more - after all, there are only 11 in the world and this is the best of the best.

'But that's just the way the market works.

'The buyer was very surprised to have got the Apple 1 at that price but very happy he did.

'We can't reveal the buyer's name but he is the young CEO of an American world-leading company similar to Apple and sees a lot of similarities between himself and Steve Jobs.

'The Apple 1 is a symbol of the American dream and I think the buyer saw this purchase as a way of keeping that dream alive.'

Jobs, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2011, was 21 when he and Wozniak sold the Apple 1s for £420 each in 1976.

The devices were built on order for a local computer shop called The Byte Store before Jobs and

Wozniak moved their makeshift operation downstairs to his garage.

A far cry from today's high-tech Apple devices, they came with a separate monitor, keyboard, motherboard and cassette player to load programmes and only had 8K of memory, not even enough to store one song.

Yet the primitive machine gave birth to the Apple empire, including the MacBook, iPod, iPhone and iPad.

The Byte Store's advertising slogan for the Apple 1 was 'Take a byte from an apple'.

It is believed this inspired Apple's famous logo of an apple with a chunk bitten out of it.
