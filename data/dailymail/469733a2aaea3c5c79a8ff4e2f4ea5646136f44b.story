Dr Khalid Qidwai and Shahnaz Qidwai

A cash-strapped tradesman charged over the murder of a Sydney woman begged the victim's  husband for money two months before the violent bashing in a multi-million dollar waterfront home, a court has heard.

The daughter of Shahnaz Qidwai, who was found bludgeoned to death the day after a feud between Dr Khalid Qidwai and Tony Halloun, said her mother never trusted the man they hired to concrete their driveway at their home in Henley, Sydney.

Maha Qidwai told the NSW Supreme Court on Thursday that her mother had mentioned several times that she didn’t find him 'very trustworthy', Channel Nine reported.

Maha, 28, sobbed as she told the court that she had not been back to the family home since  discovering her mother's body on that fatal day on June 15, 2012.

The day before Mrs Qidwai was found dead, Halloun went to her husband's medical surgery in Croydon and asked for $3,500 but Dr Qidwai refused to pay before the job was done.

This response allegedly prompted Halloun to use the chilling words ‘I'll win in the end’.

Maha Qidwai sobbed as she told the court that she had not been back to the family home since discovering her mother's body on that fatal day on June 15, 2012

'I'll win in the end' are the chilling words of Tony Halloun (pictured) believed to have been said to Dr Khalid Qidwai the day before he allegedly murdered the doctor's wife in their Sydney home

The following day Dr Qidwai's wife, Shahnaz Qidwai, 65, was found bashed to death in their multi-million dollar waterfront home in Henley, northwest Sydney

Halloun, who was hired to concrete the Qidwai's driveway (pictured), went to Dr Qidwai's surgery and asked him for $3,500 but he refused to pay before the job was done which prompted Halloun's threatening words

Maha, the couple's youngest daughter, said she had heard Halloun begging for money from her father two months before her mother was killed.

'Please, whatever you can give me, doctor,' she recalled Halloun saying in a 'softer voice than normal.'

'Dad then came in and asked my mum for $200 and he walked outside with the intention to give it to Tony.'

A month before the conversation, Maha was interrupted by a 'relatively loud' discussion between her father and Halloun, which lasted about half an hour, the court heard.

'That was a conversation about the quoting of the job,' she said.

Maha said Halloun had also spoken to her about being thousands of dollars in debt.

Halloun's barrister Peter Lange asked if Maha would do 'whatever it takes to secure conviction?'

'I think it would be yes for anyone in my situation,' she replied.

Halloun, who has pleaded not guilty to the murder, had arrived at the home in Henley - a little known but wealthy suburb in northwest Sydney - at about 7.40 that morning then Dr Qidwai left to go to his surgery about 9am.

Halloun is alleged to have told police that three armed intruders stormed into the house telling him ‘don't worry, we are not here for you’ and then he said the men ordered him to ‘get her’.

So Halloun then grabbed Mrs Qidwai by the hair and dragged her, ‘kicking and screaming’.

The last time he saw her, Halloun said she had tears streaming down her face and a gun to her head.

‘She was in fear for her life,’  he said.

Halloun said he then went to his car, smoked a cigarette and waited to see if the men came out, then about 40 minutes later he left the property.

Maha said she had heard Halloun begging her father Dr Khalid Qidwai (pictured outside the court) for money two months before her mother was killed

On the opening day of his trial on Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard the labourer contacted police a year after he was charged with the crime and said he had ‘more information’ about that fatal day on June 15, 2012.

It was one of three inconsistent versions of events that the financially-stressed Halloun gave after Mrs Qidwai was bashed to death inside her home, crown prosecutor Giles Tabuteau told the jury on Tuesday.

When Maha came home from work at 2pm, she found her mother on the floor near her bed with her face and mouth covered in blood and bruises - she was cold to touch.

Halloun had left more than two hours earlier.

Crown prosecutor Giles Tabuteau  (pictured) said Halloun took $3,400 from the home which Mrs Qidwai was organising the money to pay her husband's staff around the time of the attack

Mr Tabuteau said Halloun fabricated three different versions of events in order to explain DNA and crime scene evidence

At the time of Mrs Qidwai's death, the court heard she had been organising the money to pay her husband's staff and had about $3,400 in envelopes in the home.

'The crown case is that the money was taken at the time of or moments after the attack on Mrs Qidwai and that it was the accused who took that money,' Mr Tabuteau said.

The crown says Halloun's business was $97,000 in debt.

After police questioned him about the murder, Mr Tabuteau said he fabricated three different versions of events in order to explain DNA and crime scene evidence.

But Mr Lange questioned that Halloun's financial difficulties provided a motive.

'What does common sense tell you about a robbery worth $2000 to $4000? ... is that a motive to kill the wife of your employer?' he said.

The trial continues.
