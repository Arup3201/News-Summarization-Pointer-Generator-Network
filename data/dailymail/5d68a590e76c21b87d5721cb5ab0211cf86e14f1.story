A 75-year-old conman has been jailed for six years after pocketing £90,000 from the sale of a house he didn't even own.

Brian Kiddell posed as the owner of the home in Newton Abbot, Devon, and put the house up for sale on the internet.

The real owner had no idea what was going on until he happened to drive past the property and noticed an estate agent's For Sale board outside.

When he alerted police, he discovered that Kiddell had already completed the sale and made off with the money.

he then sold for £90,000 on the internet in one of his most elaborate 
frauds

Gareth Evans, prosecuting, said: 'Kiddell had been renting the house for four months when the owner happened, purely by chance, to be driving past and noticed there was a For Sale sign outside the address.

'He contacted his own letting agent and the estate agent and found that it was being sold on behalf of a company called Momentum Asset Management.'

Exeter Crown Court heard how the house sale con was just one in a long line of complex frauds Kiddell carried out using a string of false identities.

He bought expensive clothes at a shop in Budleigh Salterton, Exeter, Devon, using cheques made out in the name of Paul Stevenson that were worthless.

In Essex, Kiddell impersonated two different people to try to extract money from bank accounts in Leigh on Sea and Canvey Island.

In one case he claimed the account holder had died and presented a fake death certificate. He claimed to be the dead man's brother but the bank blocked the transfer of £18,000 when they found the real customer was alive and well.

His next scheme involved using false documents to create a joint account with a customer at a bank in Canvey Island so he could transfer their money to himself. He withdrew £4,500 before the scam was stopped.

Kiddell was finally caught when staff at a Barclay's Bank in Launceston, Cornwall, became suspicious and called police when he tried to apply for a £25,000 loan by using the stolen account details of a legitimate customer.

Former Squash Club owner Kiddell, who has been jailed twice before for similar offences, admitted nine charges of fraud, theft, and the dishonest use of a dead man's passport.

He was jailed for a total of six years by Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, who told him: 'You are no stranger to fraud. You are a persistent fraudster who thrives on dishonesty as a method of behaviour.

'You played a key role in these frauds, and there were many. There were others involved but you knew full well what was going on.

'You pretended to be the owner of a house which you had leased in a false name, or at least the owner's representative, and you sold the property.

'You were well aware of what you were doing and used a number of aliases and a number of addresses.'
