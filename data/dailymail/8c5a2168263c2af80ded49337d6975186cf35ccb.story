A mentally-ill man is suspected of killing his parents at their family home after he stopped taking his medication, neighbours said last night.

The bodies of Leszek Dantes, and his wife Malgorzata, both 54, were discovered early yesterday at their semi-detached home.

Police said a 28-year-old man, identified by neighbours as their son Kamil, said to be schizophrenic, had been detained and was being treated in hospital.

Shocked neighbours told how a man was led out of the family home in handcuffs and a white forensics suit after emergency services descended on the street at around 7am.

Officers said the tragedy was an 'isolated incident' - but patrols would be carried out in the area to reassure worried locals.

Post-mortem examinations on Mr and Mrs Dantes, originally from Poland and thought to be in their late 50s, are due to be carried out on Tuesday.

It is understood he had slashed his wrists after knifing his parents at the house in Worksop, Nottinghamshire.

A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said detectives were 'working to establish the circumstances surrounding their deaths' - the causes of which have not yet been revealed.

Neighbours said the 'quiet' family had lived in the house, which was cordoned off while an investigation was carried out, for around eight months.

They told how the man and his mother both worked shifts in local factories and made sure someone was always at home to care for Mr Dantes.

Faye Peacock, 64, said: 'They were a nice family. Leszek had difficulty getting around. He would have to use a wheelchair or zimmer frame. Kamil and his mum took turns looking after him.

'They worked different shift patterns. Sometimes the Red Cross would call at the house to help Leszek.

'We don't know what happened. It was a very quiet Bank Holiday, then around about 7am there were blue lights everywhere. Kamil was later led out of the house in handcuffs and dressed in a white forensic suit.

'They were a very quiet family, but very polite. When they first moved in they knocked on my door and gave me a cake as a gesture of goodwill. I enjoyed having them as neighbours.

'You never heard them rowing or arguing. There were never raised voices. We used to chat over the fence. They said they were looking forward to doing up the garden.'

The family's home was surrounded by scaffolding, and neighbours said the local authority had spent thousands of pounds on a new roof and windows in recent weeks.

Maria Pettinger, 35, was a work colleague of the 28-year-old at the Greencore sandwich factory in Worksop.

She said: 'I have worked with Kamil for two years. He was known at work for being placid, quiet and over-polite.

'He and his parents came over here for Poland about seven years ago. There was nothing in his character which would make you think he could do anything violent. He was well-liked at work.'

A police spokesman said: 'A man has been arrested following the deaths of two people in Worksop.

'The bodies of a man and a woman were found in a house just before 7am.

'Detectives are working to establish the circumstances surrounding their deaths.

'A 28-year-old man, who was arrested on suspicion of murder, is receiving treatment in hospital.

'The post mortems and formal identification are expected to conclude on Tuesday. A family liaison officer is working with the family at this difficult time.'

Inspector Phil Davies, of Notts Police, said: 'I would like to reassure the community that incidents of this nature are very rare. This was an isolated incident and we have made an arrest. House to house enquiries and patrols will be continuing in the area to reassure residents.'
