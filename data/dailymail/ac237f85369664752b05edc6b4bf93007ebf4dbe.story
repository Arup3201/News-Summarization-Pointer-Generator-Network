A bungling burglar ended up crashing into a glass door after forgetting where he broke in to an electrical store.

The thief was captured on CCTV smashing the glass of the door of All Points Electric in Brandon, Canada at 3 am on Thursday to gain entry to the premises.

But the intruder, who didn't even steal anything, then decided to make a quick getaway but seemingly couldn't remember which glass door he had broken.

The intruder can be seen approaching the front door of All Points Electric armed with a steel ring

He then prepares to swing the ring at the door to break the glass so he can enter the shop

He can then be seen taking a run up to the door he didn't destroy and crashing into it head first.

He then realises his mistake and quickly makes his exit through the correct door.

Police are now searching for the man, who broke into the shop, who is thought to be in his 20s but didn't escape with any items.

After shattering the glass, he makes his way into the store by crawling though the hole he has made

But to assist officers with their hunt, All Points Electric uploaded the clip from their surveillance video to their Facebook page in a bid to help track the man down.

The post said: 'Break in at our shop, if you know the person in the video please contact Brandon police.

'Nothing was taken, but he did smash 2 garage windows, door glass and 3 truck windows. Please share.'

But after seemingly forgetting which door he broke, he runs and crashes his head of the other door as he tries to make his getaway

Store owner Darren Wright is hopeful the comic value of the video clip will help them find the man who vandalised their store.

The told the Winnipeg Sun: 'That's why I posted it, if it wasn't funny I would've just let the police figure it out.

'I’m sure someone will catch him. It’s great with social media because now a lot of people are watching the video.'
