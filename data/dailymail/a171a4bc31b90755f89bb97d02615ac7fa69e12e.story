Honored: Jahi McMath, a 13-year-old California girl who was declared brain-dead after suffering complications from sleep apnea surgery, will receive an honorary diploma during her schools eighth grade graduation

The family of a 13-year-old California girl who was declared brain-dead after suffering complications from sleep apnea surgery says she will receive an honorary diploma during her school's eighth grade graduation.

Omari Sealey, the uncle of Jahi McMath, said Wednesday the girl's school, E.C. Reems Academy of Technology and Arts in Oakland, will give the diploma to a family member.

The school's graduation ceremony is Friday.

Jahi was in eighth grade and scheduled to
 graduate when she underwent tonsil surgery at UCSF Benioff Children's 
Hospital Oakland in December.

Her heart stopped and she went into cardiac arrest causing brain damage. She was later
 declared brain-dead.

The hospital said was so 
severe that she was effectively dead with no chance of survival if a 
respirator was turned off.

Her family went to court to prevent the 
hospital from taking her off the machine.

Jahi was eventually released 
to them and moved to another facility. Sealey said his niece is doing well.

Three doctors and the court agreed she was brain dead and the hospital applied to turn off her life support machine.

Hope: Jahi's family are certain that she will one day recover despite the hospital's insistence there is no chance of that happening

But her family, led by  Jahi’s uncle Omari Sealey, refused to accept the prognosis and argued there was still a chance she could recover.

They said that she responded to her mother’s voice and asked that she be removed to a hospital that cared for her.

Earlier this year, Oakland's Children's Hospital insisted the girl could not be be rehabilitated.

'This is a deceased young woman,' Children's Hospital Oakland spokesman Sam Singer said.

'No amount of food, medicine, medical machinery, time or hope is going to bring back her back.

'So it's really wrong and unethical for Mr. Dolan (the family lawyer) to mislead the family and the public that there's any amount of hope or any food that could possibly bring back this deceased young woman.

Devastated: Jahi's parents fought to keep their 13-year-old daughter alive after she was declared brain dead following complications in routine tonsil surgery last December

Devotion: Jahi's parents haven't left her bedside since the tragedy during a routine tonsil operation although she has now been moved hospitals

Jahi's family, led by her mother 
Nailah and uncle Omari Sealey, have refused to accept the prognosis and 
argued there was still a chance she could recover.

Jahi's family has raised more than $61,000 on GoFundMe.com to move her.

In a recent update, a her mother provided details on Jahi's condition.

'Jahi
 is still sleep but physically stable! No pic lines, no catheters, no 
I.V, she maintains all her vitals on her own, no medicines needed. I am 
giving her lots of vitamins and fish oil thru her feeding tube.

She
 moves around so much that we have to put pillows around her bed. She 
responds to pain, cold and touch. She can turn her head from left to 
right and her ventilator is set to room air so she is not getting any 
extra oxygen like she was before.

Her
 skin is flawless and she gets a mani and pedi every week done by me 
(mom) She gets physical therapy three times a week and never has a stiff
 joint!

All organs are 
healthy and fully functional! She is such a fighter! Remember she didn't
 get any nutrition for 28 days from the other hospital and she recovered
 from that quickly. Prayer is so powerful!'
