Prominent ABC journalist Leigh Sales has copped a barrage of complaints on social media from those claiming she was too soft on Tony Abbott during a televised interview.

The Prime Minister was interviewed by Sales on the ABC's 7.30 program on Thursday night and her name quickly started trending on Twitter.

Viewers claimed Mr Abbott got away with the 'lightest and fluffiest' of interviews, with some even comparing Sales to Today host Karl Stefanovic who was applauded for putting tough questions to the PM on Monday.

ABC journalist Leigh Sales has copped a barrage of complaints on social media from those claiming she was too soft on Tony Abbott during a TV interview on Thursday

Mr Abbott hinted at a Cabinet reshuffle during the interview and when Sales pressed him about it, he said: 'At some stage between now and the next election, quite probably, but this is a good frontbench'.

He then went on to praise the work of his Cabinet ministers, including Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann and Treasurer Joe Hockey.

Sales also asked Mr Abbott whether he would step aside if it meant giving the Liberals the best chance of holding onto power.

But the prime minister would not give her a direct answer, saying that it was 'a fair question'.

'The one fundamental lesson of the last catastrophic government was that you don't lightly change leaders,' Mr Abbott said while placing his words carefully. 

'Governments that change their leaders haven't done very well lately.'

Twitter lit up following the interview suggesting the interview allowed Mr Abbott to get an easy ride.

'And as predicted @leighsales gives Abbott the lightest and fluffiest of interviews. Allowing him to go on and on, no brakes applied,' one user wrote.

'Abbott really believes his own lies. That looked like a scripted interview to me too,' another quipped.

'Might be time for the ABC to hire Karl Stefanovic to ask the serious questions. This Leigh Sales is no good.'

Mr Abbott was also questioned over his government's broken promises.

'People sure may well feel dismayed, disappointed, occasionally even surprised, but I think that they also understand that governments have to respond to the circumstances they find themselves in,' he said. 

But he said much had happened in 12-14 months and circumstances did change, with Labor's promised $18 billion deficit actually coming in at $48 billion. 

'I think that they (voters) also understand that governments have to respond to the circumstances that they find themselves,' he said.

Mr Abbott said the government had kept faith with the Australian people because it had fundamentally honoured core commitments to stop the boats, repeal the carbon tax, build the roads and start the job of budget repair.

He said there had been a lot of unjustified cries he had broken his promises.

On ABC funding cuts, he said plainly he did say the night before the election there would be no cuts to the national broadcaster.

'We flagged a very urgent task of budget repair,' he said.

'It's interesting that in the run-up to the budget, the messages we were getting back from our constituents and, yes, from Liberal Party polling, was people were frightened we would squib it.'

Mr Abbott said he was saying to the Australian people there was a need to adjust to changed circumstances and the government was deadly serious about returning the budget to surplus.

'If you are trying to get from point A to point B and one way is blocked you find another way. You don't abandon your objective,' he said.

Mr Abbott said he would not flag potential compromises to get stalled budget measures through the Senate.

'That's going to be a matter for discussion and negotiation with the crossbench,' he said.

'There will be further things to be announced by this government. We will be governing right up until Christmas Eve.'

According the latest Newspoll released on Tuesday, Labor (party leader Bill Shorten pictured above) is leading on 54 per cent, with the Coalition trailing behind on 46 per cent

Mr Abbott was asked about changing leaders, just like the former Labor government who went through two leadership changes going from Kevin Rudd (right) to Julia Gillard (left) then back to Kevin Rudd
