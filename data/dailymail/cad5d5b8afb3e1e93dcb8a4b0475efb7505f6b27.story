The timing of the birth of the future monarch was on everyone's minds today as the nation waited on tenderhooks for the little Prince's arrival.

After the announcement that the baby boy arrived at 4.24 today, we now know he is a Cancerian, like his father Prince William and grandmother Diana, Princess of Wales.

Astrologers predicted that if the Duchess of Cambridge had a lengthy labour, the Monarch could be a feisty Leo rather than an emotional Cancerian.

Had he been born after 4.54 today, the child would have been a Leo, like its great aunt Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, and Princess Anne.

He's a Cancerian! Just like his father and grandmother, the Royal baby narrowly avoided becoming a Leo. If he had been born just half an hour later, we could have had a very different kind of Monarch

The Duchess of Cambridge went into labour at 5.30am this morning - with many suggesting the  approaching full moon at 11.16am helped bring on the contractions. 

Prince William was by his wife's side at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, west London, where he himself was born in 1982.

Astrologer with The Association of Professional Astrologers International, Deike Begg, says the timing of the baby's birth this afternoon plays a huge role in his personality type.

She said, as a Cancer, the baby should be 
sensitive, caring, shrewd, family oriented and protective of their loved
 ones.

She said the baby's moon will be in Capricorn - which is the same star-sign as his mother.

'This means the baby will share a lot of the parents' personality traits.

Different personality types: Diana, Princess of Wales, pictured left at a Live Aid for Africa concert in 1985, was Cancer, while Princess Margaret, pictured in 1960, was a Leo

'As
 a Cancer, the child will be very family oriented like its parents and 
sensitive. Cancers often appear strong on the outside but are very soft 
on the inside.

'But with a Capricorn moon it would also be aware of its responsibilities and dependable.'

Traditionally
 those born under the star-sign of Cancer arrive between June 22nd 
and July 22nd although the exact dates vary slightly every year.

Famous
 Cancers include South African president Nelson Mandela, Hollywood 
actors Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise, and Edward VIII, who 
gave up the throne for American divorcee Wallis Simpson.

Prince William, who was born on June 21, is a Cancerian as was his mother Diana, Princess of Wales, whose birthday was July 1.

Astrologer Patrick Arundell said the 
future king or queen will be more conventional because it is a 
Cancerian, but would have been more of a ground-breaker if he was born 
tomorrow as a Leo.

Mr Arundell said the baby would also have a lot of 'go-get energy' and star quality.

'Mars
 and Jupiter are conjunct in Cancer and that will give the baby a 
tremendous amount of go-get energy and that is already in motion,' he 
said.

He added: 'Venus 
and the Sun are also in a magnetic connection which will give the baby a
 star quality and a sparkling charisma.'

Meanwhile there have been numerous theories as to what caused the Duchess of Cambridge to go into labour - whether it was the full moon, an electrical storm or just conventional 'Baby Mean Time'.

Maternity
 wards are said to be busier during a full moon, although there is 
debate in the medical world about whether the moon does encourage women 
to go into labour.

Mervi
 Jokinen, of the Royal College of Midwives, said midwives often talk of 
how the full moon makes for a busy spate of deliveries.

'It's
 always sort of been an old wives tale saying that the full moon brings 
women into labour. Midwives usually do say "I'm on call. It's a full 
moon. I'll be busy tonight",' she said.

'There
 was a study about 20 years ago at a hospital near the River Thames 
which is a tidal river and it showed that on the full moon they did have
 more births.

'The idea
 is that because the baby is surrounded by water, the time of the full 
moon and the high tide causes the waters to break. But there's not enough scientific evidence to show it's proven.'

Birth
 coach Zara de Candole, of Doula UK, said: 'As a doula (birth coach) who
 has supported many women in labour, there does seem to be some link 
between labour kick starting and a full moon.'

There are also suggestions electrical storms and a drop in barometric pressure can bring on labour.

Western central London - near where William and Kate's Kensington Palace apartment is based - experienced isolated heavy rain, thunder and lightning strikes at 6am this morning - just at Kate was admitted to the Lindo wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington.

Chris Burton, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: 'The storm affected western central London. There were lightning strikes at around 6am and very localised, intense heavy rain and thunder.

'We've had high pressure with the sunshine but now there's low pressure and it's hot and humid which can cause thunder storms.'

Mervi Jokinen said she had not seen a connection between labour and electrical storms.

'We are full of electrolytes but I don't know. it's not something we've discussed as a midwific community. I can't vouch for that,' she said

She added that babies also arrived to their own agenda and their own time scale and put in an appearance when they are ready.

'Nature has its own way of preparing for labour. Before the baby comes, the body need to do some preparations and that's very important,' she said.
