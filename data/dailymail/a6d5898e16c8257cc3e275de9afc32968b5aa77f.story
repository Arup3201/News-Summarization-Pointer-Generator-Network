A judge has thrown out allegations made by a 'murdered' prosecutor that Argentina's president covered up Iranian involvement in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish centre.

The case against Cristina Kirchner was dismissed by Judge Daniel Rafecas who said documents filed by the late prosecutor Alberto Nisman failed to meet the standards needed to open a formal court investigation.

Nisman had filed the complaint days before he died on January 18 under mysterious circumstances with polls showing that many Argentinians suspected officials had some hand in the death.

President Kirchner called accusations against her 'absurd'. Iran has consistently denied involvement in the attack.

Case dismissed: A judge has thrown out allegations made by a 'murdered' prosecutor that Argentina's president covered up Iranian involvement in a deadly 1994 bombing in Buenos Aires

Fatal: 85 people died in the explosion at a Jewish centre in Argentina's capital city on July 18, 1994

President Kirchner had been under fire since Nisman was found dead in his Buenos Aires apartment on January 18.

He accused her of protecting high-ranking Iranian officials from the deadly bombing which left 85 people dead in exchange for oil.

Posecutor Gerardo Pollicita picked up the case after Nisman's death and accused Kirchner, Foreign Minister Hector Timerman and other government officials of mounting a cover-up and violating their duties,  a prosecution statement revealed.

But the case has now been dismissed by a judge in Buenos Aires. 

Nisman, 51, was found in his Buenos Aires apartment with a gunshot wound to the head on January 18. 

Mysterious: The case's prosecutor Alberto Nisman - who accused the government of secret deals with Iran - died one day before he was due to answer questions in congress

It is still not known if he was murdered or not. His death at the age of 51 was initially labelled a suicide.

The president later suggested he was manipulated by disgruntled former intelligence agents who killed him to smear her name.

She branded Nisman's accusation that she conspired to whitewash his investigation 'absurd.'   

Earlier this month, 61-year-old Kirchner used her Facebook page to deny the allegations and urged her citizens to look at the positives in Argentina.

She wrote: 'You know what? Let’s forget about the hatred, the pain, the insults, the false accusations.

'We have the AUH [an education loan for children of low-income families], pensions, same-sex marriage, more and more human rights, the highest minimum wage in history, nationalized industries, investments in infrastructure, education, universities, scientists, schools and children.'
