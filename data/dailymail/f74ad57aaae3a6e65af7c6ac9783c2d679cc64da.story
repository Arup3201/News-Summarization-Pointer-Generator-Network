A filter-feeding 'lobster' as big as a human took the place of whales 480 million years ago, a new fossil find has shown.

The 6.5ft (two-metre) prehistoric creature belonged to the family of anomalocaridids that were the early ancestors of modern crustaceans, insects and spiders.

At this length it would have been comparable in size to athlete Usain Bolt, actor Liam Hemsworth and former wrestler Hulk Hogan.

The remains were unearthed in Morocco and it is thought to be the oldest giant filter-feeder ever discovered.

But while most of its relatives were shark-like apex predators with circular mouths ringed by sharp teeth, the new species, named Aegirocassis benmoulae, was a 'gentle giant'.

The 6.5ft (two-metre) prehistoric creature belonged to the family of anomalocaridids that were the early ancestors of modern crustaceans, insects and spiders.

Like modern-day whales, it filtered seawater to trap tiny particles of food, using spine-covered 'limbs' on its head.

Fossils also show that Aegirocassis had pairs of swimming flaps along its body. 

These were likely to be precursors of the unique double-branched appendages seen in modern crustaceans. 

Like modern-day whales, it filtered seawater to trap tiny particles of food, using spine-covered 'limbs' on its head.

Modern-day lobsters grow to around 19 inches (50cm) and modern-day whales average at around 79ft (25 metres).  

Dr Allison Daley, from Oxford University, who co-led a team studying Aegirocassis writing in the journal Nature, said: 'This would have been one of the largest animals alive at the time.

'These animals are filling an ecological role that hadn't previously been filled by any other animal. 

'While filter-feeding is probably one of the oldest ways for animals to find food, previous filter-feeders were smaller, and usually attached to the sea-floor. 

'We have found the oldest example of gigantism in a freely swimming filter-feeder.'

A. benmoulae was named after the Moroccan fossil hunter who discovered it, Mohamed Ben Moula.

The 3D fossil, exposed using tiny needle-like tools to chip away the surrounding rock, is exceptionally well preserved.

The three-dimensional fossil (pictured), exposed using tiny needle-like tools to chip away the surrounding rock, is 'exceptionally well preserved'. Other anomalocaridid fossils have been flat, like pressed leaves

The fossils (pictured left and right) also show that Aegirocassis had pairs of swimming flaps along its body, which were likely to be precursors to the unique double-branched appendages seen in modern crustaceans. They also bear resemblance to gill flaps seen on the trunks of modern arthropods

In contrast, other anomalocaridid fossils have been flat, like pressed leaves.

'Without these 3D remains we may never have got the insight into these animals' anatomy that we did,' said Dr Daley.

The fossil shows that Aegirocassis had pairs of swimming flaps along its body, which were likely to be precursors of the unique double-branched appendages seen in modern crustaceans.

They also bear resemblance to gill flaps seen on the trunks of modern arthropods. 

The large size of this filter feeder suggests that the anomalocaridids were well-adapted to take advantage of a presumably rich source of plankton during the Ordovician period, said the authors.

The fossils were found in the Fezouata Biota formation region of central Anti-Atlas in Morocco (marked)
