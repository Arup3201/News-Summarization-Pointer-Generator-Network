A tragically-mutated piglet born with 'a face like a human's' has died not long after birth - but now collectors are keen to buy the animal's remains.

The extraordinary-looking creature was recently born on a Chinese farm and when pictures of it circulated online, owner Tao Lu was flooded with offers to buy the creature.

The farmer decided to keep the deformed pig in the hope of turning it into a lucrative tourist attraction - but sadly the animal died after being rejected by its mother and refusing to feed from a bottle.

Mutant piglet: With its beak-life face, huge eyes and peculiar growth on its forehead, the unfortunate newborn was almost indistinguishable as a piglet

With its beak-life face, huge eyes and peculiar growth on its forehead, the unfortunate newborn was almost indistinguishable as a pig in its short life.

News of its strange deformity spread when a local newspaper published pictures of the animal - with several readers offering to buy it.

Tau Lu said his friends and neighbour also rushed to see the piglet at his farm in Yanan township in the city of Nanning in southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Farmer Tao, 40, said: 'It was a large litter, and the mutant was one of the last of 19 piglets to be born.

'All the others were normal, just this one was really bizarre. It is a shame it died, I could have got more money for it then for the rest of the family put together based on what people were offering me on the phone.'

Despite squirming and squealing after its was born, the piglet did not last long.

Local resident Wu Kung, 32, who posted these images online, said: 'I was one of a dozen people who went there to see the piglet, and it really did have human face  growing out of its forehead.'
