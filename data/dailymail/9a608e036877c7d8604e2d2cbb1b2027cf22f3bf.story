Watch the incredible moment the New York City Police tackles a gang of unlicensed quad bikes that have been roaming the city.

The video shows the NYPD crackdown against the growing number of illegal and unlicensed motorbikes such as dirt bikes and quad bikes that have been terrorising the city's inhabitants.

The filmed incident is the latest in a number of close calls between the quad bikes and the pedestrians and cars on the streets, with some eyewitnesses claiming that the bikers routinely take to the pavements, which has caused a high number of accidents.

Reacting to the increased numbers of bikers, the NYPD has issued special patrols around Harlem and Washington Heights, and as of today have confiscated 8 dirt bikes and quad bikes, and made 3 arrests, 2 men in their 20s, and one in his 40s.

The NYPD has said the do not pursue the bikers when they see them, because they believe a high speed police chase with the bikes would be too dangerous for pedestrians.

The video shows a gang of bikers on quad bikes roaming around a busy street, with some taking to pavements and doing dangerous stunts, when two squad cars block a few of the bikers, one of which disembarks and attempts to flee on foot.Â
