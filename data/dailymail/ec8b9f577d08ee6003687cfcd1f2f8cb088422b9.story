An elderly woman committed suicide by jumping into a pond full of crocodiles, it has been reported.

Wanpen Inyai, 65, was torn apart after apparently throwing herself into a pit with more than 1,000 crocodiles at a zoo in Bangkok, Thailand.

A disturbing picture was posted online reportedly showing a crocodile approaching her moments before she was attacked.

Police said they arrived at the scene to find zoo keepers and staff desperately trying to ward off dozens of reptiles which were feasting on her body.

Her sister Sunan Tharmna said Wanpen was depressed and had not spoken to anyone for several days before her death on Friday.

Her family tried to file a missing person's report that day, but were told to wait 24 hours by Rom Klao police as required by law.

CCTV footage reportedly shows her leaving her shoes on a walkway before jumping into the pit at the Samut Prakarn Crocodile Farm & Zoo, it was reported by the Bangkok Post.

Officers said they were able to identify after finding her healthcare card floating on the surface of the water.

This was later confirmed by DNA tests.

He described her death as a 'force majeure' and expressed condolences to her family.
