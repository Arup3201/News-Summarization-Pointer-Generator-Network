Selling his clothes! Mr Bissinger is auctioning off about 150 of the designer pieces he acquired during a years-long battle with shopping addiction

Buzz Bissinger, the famed author of Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream, is selling off the designer clothes he bought during a long struggle with shopping addiction.

The 60-year-old writer - who has a penchant for leather jackets and Gucci - has enlisted the services of online retailer Luxeswap to put his high-end footwear, jackets, and pants on eBay.

Mr Bissinger opened up about his addiction in an article for GQ in April 2013, in which he estimated he'd spent $587,412.97 on both women's and men's designer duds for himself from 2010 through 2012. 

He has since gone into rehab for the problem, as well as other issues, and calls his decision to sell his possessions an 'important moment' in the recovery process, reports Put This On. 

The Pulitzer Prize winner, who lives in Philadelphia and has a wife and three grown children, is letting go of more than 150 pieces (about three-quarters of what he owns) which will be sold little by little over the next few months.

Each item will come a certificate of authenticity signed by the author himself, who says he has 'no shame about any of this.'

Matthew, Luxeswap's founder, told MailOnline that a few of the standout pieces that will be on the auction block include a $20,000 pony-skin leather Loewe coat; some 'exceptional' Gucci motorcycle jackets; and a Gucci one-of-a-kind Persian lamb coat.

'It's the finest collection of leather I've ever seen,' he said.  

Mr Bissinger told Matthew he'd need to 'get a U-haul' when he went to pick up the clothing- as an SUV wouldn't be big enough.

In his revealing essay for GQ in 2013, Mr Bissinger revealed how shopping gave him a rush of sexual energy. 

He wrote: 'I own... seventy-five pairs of boots, forty-one pairs of leather pants, thirty-two pairs of haute couture jeans, ten evening jackets, and 115 pairs of leather gloves.

'I have an addiction. It isn't drugs or gambling: I get to keep what I use after I use it.

'But there are similarities: the futile feeding of the bottomless beast and the unavoidable psychological implications, the immediate hit of the new that feels like an orgasm and the inevitable coming-down.'

Mr Bissinger, who describes Gucci as his main 'compulsion,' said the most expensive leather jacket he owns cost $13,900, which was bought from Gucci and is made of ostrich skin.

Likewise, the most evening jacket he owns is also from Gucci, as cost $9,800.

'The most expensive leather pants, $5,600,' he added. 'The most expensive jeans, $2,500. The most expensive pair of boots, $2,600. The most expensive pair of gloves, $1,015.'

Mr Bissinger now says that while he does not regret the GQ piece, it did lead to some widespread misconceptions about his state of mind.

Regardless, he considers the article his ‘way of bottoming out and knowing that I needed in-treatment help. I could no longer continue the way I was living.’

He checked into rehab days after the article was published - and revealed what it was like in an interview with Vanity Fair earlier this year. 

'I think everybody should go to rehab,' he said. 'It’s called rehab, but it’s 60 days of stepping out of your life and thinking very hard and working, because you’re seeing therapists basically 12 hours a day.'

Mr Bissinger has since put all his clothing in to a climate-controlled storage facility, which is where Luxeswap's founder went to retrieve it.

‘I pay $244 a month for an enormous storage locker. It looks like the mob just stole a truck from Gucci and Ferragamo and Prada. It’s gorgeous.’

Mr Bissinger admitted ‘I really do have a lot of clothing, if anyone wants in.’ 

While Mr Bissinger says that he no longer searches for himself on Google or Twitter, he has made a promise to journalists who are nice to him in their future coverage of his life.

If by some chance he finds their articles sans Google, he may give them a leather jacket. ‘I’ve got a lot of them,’ he said. ‘Like 80.'
