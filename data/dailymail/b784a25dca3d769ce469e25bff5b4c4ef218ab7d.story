Car giant Audi employed thousands of concentration camp inmates during the Second World War and was 'firmly ensnared' in the Nazi regime, an investigation has found.

During the war years Audi was known as Group Auto Union and, in a deal brokered by the SS, hired 3,700 concentration camp inmates to work 
in what was then Germany’s second biggest car firm.

The academic study also revealed another 16,500 forced laborers, who were not imprisoned in concentration camps, were working in Auto Union plants.

Authors of the study, economic historian Rudolf Boch of the University of Chemnitz, and Martin Kukowski, head of the Department of history at Audi, were granted access to the Audi archives for the first time for their 'house cleaning' history of the firm.

Their book, Wartime Economy And Labour Usage Of Auto Union Chemnitz AG During The Second World War, centres on the firm, which was the only serious competitor to Mercedes during the 12 year lifespan of the Third Reich, with a 20 percent market share for luxury cars.

During the war some of the plants were turned over to military production, churning out tanks and air-craft engines.

The 500 page report claims that Auto Union - now Volkswagen’s luxury marque Audi - built its success on the back of human misery and suffering, and that founder Dr Richard Bruhn was largely  responsible for the firm's large-scale exploitation of forced labour.

'More than 20,000 forced laborers were used in the production of Auto Union in their Saxon works, including almost one-fifth from concentration camps,' said the study authors.

Conditions in the concentration camp in the city of Zwickau, where many workers were held, were particularly appalling with 1,000 prisoners - many of them forced labourers from France - living in unheated barracks. 

'The conditions were devastating,' said the historians.

The researchers also discovered that disabled workers were shipped north to the Flossenburg concentration camp to be executed, and their numbers replaced with prisoners from that camp.

Towards the end of the war, 688 Zwickau inmates were sent on a death march to Karlovy Vary, now in the Czech Republic, with almost half of them dying on the way.

Audi recognised its wartime guilt in using forced labour more a decade ago, paying massive amounts into the £3billion fund which German industry set up to compensate Nazi slave workers and their descendants.

The company was founded in 1932 following a merger of four car makers, and dropped the Auto Union name after a further merger in 1985.

It is the last of the large German car makers to commission a study into its wartime past, with Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW already having done so.
