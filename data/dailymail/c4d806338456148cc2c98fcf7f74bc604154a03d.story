Nigella Lawson could fly out to America soon in an attempt to escape the media spotlight surrounding her controversial marriage to Charles Saatchi.

The celebrity chef is believed to be considering bringing forward plans to fly to Los Angeles at the end of summer.

It follows the publication of photographs which appeared to show  the millionaire art collector  squeezing his wife's throat while they ate at a central London restaurant.

Ms Lawson's plans to move out to America earlier than expected came as Mr Saatchi today said he was attempting to wipe his wife's nose.

Space: Ms Lawson is due to rent a house in LA during filming for the second series of U.S show The Taste. The taxi driver is pictured letting her out of the vehicle

Speaking to the Evening Standard, he 
said: 'Even domestic goddesses sometimes have a bit of snot in their 
nose. I was trying to fish it out'.

The advertising mogul has apparently been carrying on life as normal since the incident - last night he was seen dining at Scott's, the Mayfair restaurant where the row with his wife took place.

Ms Lawson is due to fly to LA this summer as she films a second series of U.S show The Taste. While there she plans to rent a house in LA .

Speaking to the Evening Standard, a Los Angeles TV source said: 'Going to America may give Nigella the space from her husband to help find a way to repairing the damage that has been done.'

Return: Saatchi pictured leaving Scott's on his own last night after dining at the Mayfair restaurant

Night out: The art mogul was not believed to be dining with anyone else during his visit to Scott's

The show is a food version of hit BBC show The Voice and is aired by U.S network ABC.

In
the reality contest, Ms Lawson and other judges rule on food with blind
single-spoon tastings. The show co-stars US chef and author Anthony 
Bourdain.

The initial photographs appeared to show the 70-year-old former advertising tycoon grabbing 
his wife by the throat caused a furore when published a week ago.

Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault.

Under pressure: Charles Saatchi is pictured today outside a restaurant from where he bought food

On the side: Mr Saatchi went in through a side door next to the restaurant where food was delivered to him

TV
chef Miss Lawson, 53, apparently carried on with married life as normal
after the incident.

But as soon as the pictures were published she left
the £14million family home in Chelsea to live in a £10,000-a-week 
apartment in Mayfair.

She 
was seen outside on Wednesday and Friday without her wedding ring.

On 
Saturday a bulging bag of clothes was delivered, leading to speculation 
that she is settling in for a long stay.

Miss
Lawson has two children from her first marriage to journalist John 
Diamond who died from throat cancer in 2001. She and Saatchi married ten
years ago.

Yesterday her spokesman said she was maintaining her silence on her marriage difficulties.
