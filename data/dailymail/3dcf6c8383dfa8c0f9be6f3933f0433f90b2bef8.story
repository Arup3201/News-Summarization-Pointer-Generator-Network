Murdered: A congressman has called for an FBI probe into the death of mayoral candidate Marco McMillian (pictured) in Mississippi

An openly gay Mississippi mayoral candidate whose body was found dumped on a riverbank last week was beaten and burned, his family has said.

Marco McMillian's godfather, Carter Womack, said on Monday that the information came from the Coahoma County coroner, but the coroner declined to comment.

Womack said the family was told McMillian's body was dragged under a fence and left near a Mississippi River levee last week. It was discovered on Tuesday.

A person with knowledge of the 
investigation told the Associated Press that McMillian had bruises and 
there were burns on at least part of his body.

On Thursday, Lawrence Reed, 22, was taken into custody and charged with the murder of McMillian, the state's first openly gay candidate for public office. He was running for mayor of Clarksdale.

The
 relationship between the two men is unclear but Reed was allegedly 
driving McMillian's SUV when it was involved in a head-on crash just 
before the candidate's body was discovered.

According to the pressregister.com, Reed, an associate at the Motor Club of America, was injured in the crash and provided police with the location of McMillian's body.

Authorities 
had been looking for McMillian who was reported missing after the early morning crash.

Coahoma
 County Coroner Scotty Meredith confirmed the body belonged to 
McMillian, a dedicated Democrat who was running to become mayor of 
Clarksdale.

Campaign 
supporters and residents paid tribute to the politician as a dedicated 
community activist and a legitimate candidate for office.

'We
 remember Marco as a bold and passionate public servant, whose faith 
informed every aspect of his life,' his campaign manager, Jarod Keith, 
said in a statement. 'Tragically, that life has been cut short.'

Political ambitions: Marco McMillian was running as a democrat candidate for mayor of Clarksdale. Supporters said the politician, pictured right with President Obama, could have gone all the way

The 
sheriff's office said deputies responded to the two-car crash on U.S. 
Highway 49 South near the Coahoma and Tallahatchie county lines at about 8 a.m.

Promising: Colleagues said McMillian, 34, was 'President of the United States material'

McMillian
 was hoping to win the office being vacated by Mayor Henry Espy Jr., the
 brother of Mike Espy, a former congressman and U.S. Agriculture 
Secretary.

Henry Espy decided not to seek re-election after more than 
two decades in office.

Fans and friends of McMillian, whose 
Facebook account features a picture of him alongside President Obama, paid tribute to him last week.

Dennis Thomas, 33, who works at Abe's Barbeque, said: 'There's
 a lot of people upset about it. Why would somebody want to do something
 like that to somebody of that caliber?

'He was a highly respected person
 in town. He's been in the community helping out a lot.'

Norman Van Collins Sr took to Facebook to say the party had lost a future star.

'I am definitely praying for the family as well as sharing their grief,' he said.

'Marco was like a son to me, and I so looked forward to his campaign and 
his ultimately becoming the next mayor of my hometown Clarksdale which 
so desperately needs leadership such that of Marco.  He was definitely 
POTUS potential.'

The
 Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund and Institute said there 'hearts go 
out to the family and friends of Marco McMillian'.

Hopeful: Mr McMillian was running for mayor of Clarksdale after years as a dedicated community activist

Tragic: It's unclear whether Reed knew the candidate, pictured

McMillian
 was CEO of MWM & Associates, described on its website as a 
consulting firm for non-profit organizations. He had recently served as 
international executive director of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Inc.

Jimmy
 Hammock, the fraternity's international president, praised McMillian in
 a Facebook post for making 'an incredible difference in his community 
and in Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity'.

A statement
 from the historically black fraternity said he had secured the first 
federal contract to 'raise the awareness of the adverse impact of 
HIV/AIDS on communities of color for the Fraternity'.

It noted that 
Ebony Magazine had recognized him in 2004 as one of the nation's '30 
up-and-coming African Americans' under age 30.
