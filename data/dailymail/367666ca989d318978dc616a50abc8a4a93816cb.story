This is the moment a British teenager was reunited with her tearful mother after running away with a ‘violent and abusive’ Turkish barman while on holiday.

Faye Jones, 16, was found by police yesterday hitch-hiking across the mountainous Turkish countryside with Murat Can Ertani, 22.

She told officers she had only gone with him because she was ‘frightened of what he might do’ to her.

Tearful reunion: Faye Jones, 16, was finally reunited with her mother Rhonda Jones at Mugla Police Station this afternoon after she went missing with 22-year-old Turkish waiter Murat Can Ertani

Found: Today police contacted Faye's mother Rhonda, to say that she had been found with Can about an hour away from the resort

Back together: The pair hugged as they were reunited after a frantic four-day search

The pair, who had disappeared from 
the resort of Marmaris on Thursday, were discovered walking in the 
searing heat more than 40 miles away.

Faye and her mother Rhonda, 39, wept and hugged when they were reunited at the police station in the remote town of Mugla.

‘Why did you do it Faye? Why?’ Mrs Jones asked her daughter. ‘Do you love him?’

Sobbing, she replied: ‘No I don’t love him. I was just frightened of what he might do.’

Together again: Faye and Rhonda embrace after their emotional reunion

Smiles all round: Faye, who was sunburned and had insect bites and scratches on her legs, was given a translator so she could give an account of her four-day ordeal

Ertani was last night being quizzed by detectives after being arrested on kidnap charges for taking a minor without consent.

It also emerged that the waiter, who 
has convictions for burglary, had previously seduced a Scottish teenager
who became pregnant.

Faye, who lives in Cramlington, 
Northumberland, had scratches and insect bites on her legs and was 
treated for sunburn and minor injuries in hospital before being 
interviewed with her mother by police at a special juvenile station.

The teenager had arrived in Marmaris 
on June 27 with her mother to visit her grandmother Jackie Armstrong, 
68, who lives and works in the resort.

Located: Faye was found with Can about an hour away from the resort where she went missing. She was taken to Mulga police station

She had met Ertani while on holiday last year and had kept in touch through Facebook and Skype.

The pair met again last week, but Mrs
Jones banned her daughter from seeing him after he erupted into a 
jealous rage on a night out when he had stopped Faye from dancing, told 
her she looked like ‘a slut’ and choked her.

Faye, who completed her GCSEs this 
summer, later packed a suitcase and was seen driving away from the 
apartment with Ertani while her mother gave chase.

One of her friends, who was slapped 
by Ertani during the nightclub incident, said the teenager only ran away
with him because he had threatened to harm her and her mother.

Faye and her mother Rhonda Jones were driven away from the police station in Mugla this afternoon

Distraught: Faye's mother Rhonda has been frantically searching for her. But today police contacted her to say that she had been found

Mrs Jones was told yesterday afternoon that Faye was safe. ‘I’m very, very happy that we have found her,’ she said.

Faye and her mother are now expected 
to return to the UK by the end of the week after police have carried out
their investigations.

Earlier yesterday it emerged that 
Ertani has had a child with a Scottish teenager whom he started grooming
over the internet when she was only 15.

Turkish police say Murat Can Ertani is a criminal and has spent time in jail

More than 30 Turkish police officers were put on the case and the family put missing person posters up around the resort

Fall out: Faye's mother said she had to go home after an incident in which Can allegedly slapped one of her friends in a bar

Fears: Faye, left, argued with her mother about Can after he allegedly slapped her friend Georgina, right, in a bar

Frantic: Miss Jones, pictured with Faye, said she has been searching the resort day and night

Alanah Longshaw, now 19, from 
Stirling, eventually visited him and decided to live with Ertani in 
Turkey, but the relationship quickly went sour in 2011.

She moved back to Stirling after she 
said she was attacked by Ertani and forced to live in apartments without
electricity and water.

It was then that she discovered she was pregnant with her son Aydin, who is now 18 months old.
Ertani then became ‘violent and aggressive as he was drinking all the time’, she said.

‘He would lock me in the apartment for hours on end while he went out to get drunk and then he’d come home and attack me.’

Relationship: Faye met Can when she visited Marmaris last year and they kept in touch on Facebook
