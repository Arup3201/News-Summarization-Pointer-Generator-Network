A new Samsung TV television advert is outraging rights groups for both women and men, being slammed as sexist from both sides.

The commercial - which advertises the brand's Evolution Kit, which turns any Samsung TV into an internet-ready Smart TV - portrays men as useless, loutish neanderthals... and women as pushovers who put up with such behaviour.

Slammed by critics as 'offensive', 'man-hating', and 'feminist porn', the Evolutionary Husband? advert, released on American networks, has still had almost 10 million views onÂ Samsung's YouTube channel.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The Samsung TV advert shows men to be grunting, filthy, dead-eyed neanderthals... and women as the type to put up with such behaviour

The advert shows a wife plugging an Evolution Kit into her Samsung TV, then imagining how such a piece of equipment might turn her filthy, lazy, chicken drumstick-gnawing layabout of a husband into a high-functioning human.

She envisages her husband making breakfast while doing the ironing, cleaning the kitchen, looking after the baby, baking cakes, playing the flute and plaiting her hair while serving a romantic candlelit dinner, to the upbeat jazzy tones of Come And Get It by Eli Paperboy Reed, with the lyrics: 'If you want the love of a real good man, come and get it'.

When the downtrodden wife flickers out 
of her merry daydream she finds her gassy partner back on the sofa, dead
eyes locked on TV, turning their living room into a stinking cesspit of
crumbs and idiocy. She just sighs.

Twitter users have been appalled, and a men's rights forum on Reddit features comments about the 'blatantly sexist' bent of the advert.

A user called Femdelusion writes: 'That's probably one of the most vile adverts I've ever seen. This isn't the normal IV drip of laughing at men; this is simply mainlining outright contempt.

Another, AmiroZ, complains: 'I find this advert quite sexist. The idea of an 'evolved man' is basically making him the stereotype of a woman. This isn't evolution rather than devolution.

'If this advert had the women being attached to some machine to make her better equipped to clean/cook/look after children/make her loving to her spouse/partner, there would be an outcry from feminists about equality.'

After being plugged into the Evolution Kit, the husband is an all-singing, all-domesticated 'perfect' man, capable of cooking, cleaning and caring for the children at the same time

While some YouTube comments beneath the video say 'people can't take a joke', other viewers are swearing off Samsung products, labelling the commercial 'offensive' and 'feminist porn'.

But it isn't only men who are upset by the advert, which portrays women as downtrodden mugs who put up with men who behave like this.

On Jezebel, one comment reads: 'Yeah, it sucks that men are presented as useless lumps of farting meat who can't do anything in their families. They're not.

'It also sucks that women are routinely presented as f***ing putting up with it as if it's a given that a man would be a manchild whom you'd have to clean up after and do everything for. It's almost like an excuse for men to be useless.'

Samsung had yet to comment at time of publication.
