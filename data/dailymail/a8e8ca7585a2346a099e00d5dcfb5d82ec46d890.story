Gary Glitter, pictured leaving Southwark Crown Court today, allegedly crept into the bed of an eight-year-old girl and tried to rape her in 1975

Gary Glitter crept into the bed of an eight-year-old girl and tried to rape her at the height of his fame, a court heard today.

The youngster only avoided being raped because she fell into a protective 'cocoon' of sheets and blankets, before fleeing when the drunken pop star fell asleep, jurors were told. 

The alleged incident took place while the girl was at a sleepover with a friend.  

Separately, the former glam rock singer allegedly plied another 12-year-old schoolgirl with champagne before assaulting her and also allegedly abused a young fan in his dressing room.

Now 70, the popstar - real name Paul Gadd - listened to the claims from the dock this afternoon on the first day of his trial at Southwark Crown Court. 

He is accused of a string of alleged sex crimes on three young girls in the 1970s and 1980s.

Opening the case, prosecutor John Price QC said Glitter had tried to force himself on the first girl in 1975, when she was aged eight.

He said: ‘She remembers waking up from her sleep to find him in the bed. He was drunk.

‘She remembers what she describes as a “horrible” smell of alcohol and tobacco. She remembers also that she felt very uncomfortable at his being there.’

He added: ‘She felt his hands lift her nightdress. In short it is alleged by the prosecution that Mr Gadd tried to rape her.

‘She only managed to prevent him from succeeding by moving away from him in the bed and until she had moved so far that she remembers she fell into the “envelope” or “cocoon” formed at its edge by the sheets.' 

The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, claims that Glitter fell asleep after the attack. She then ran into a bathroom to try and clean herself, the court heard.

It is alleged that the day after the attack, Glitter acted as if nothing had happened and gave the girl chocolate.

Mr Price said: ‘The next day, as she recalls, he behaved entirely as normal. Nothing was said about what he had done to her the previous night whether by him to her or her to him.' 

He added: ‘We submit that what she says he did to her involved a clear and unmistakable attempt to rape her.'

Around four years later, the former chart-topper is said to have pounced on the youngster again, pushing her onto a bed after and asking for a 'cuddle'.   

Mr Price said: 'She summoned the courage to say "No", she got up from the bed and she left the room.

Allegations: The former glam rock singer also allegedly plied another schoolgirl with champagne before assaulting her and abused a young fan in his dressing room, jurors were told. Pictured is Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, in the dock

'She tried to do so quickly and awkwardly but he took hold of her and he rolled her on to her back on the bed. She remembers that when he did that she felt frightened.' 

About a month after that alleged second incident, the youngster told her mother what had happened.  

She is also said to have told other friends of her ordeal, something which the prosecution submits is of 'great importance'.   

But jurors were told that she only went to police with her claims 20 years later, after seeing Glitter had admitted child pornography charges. 

Jurors were told that Glitter was arrested in November 1997 when he went to pick up a Toshiba laptop he had taken to be serviced at a Bristol PC World.

The arrest came after the engineer who examined the machine discovered images relating to child pornography.

Glitter subsequently admitted responsibility for a 'large number' of images on his computer, depicting sexual activity taking place between men and very young children.

Mr Price said: 'It encouraged her (the alleged victim) to report to the police, for the first time, what she says he had done to her.

'It seemed to her that recent events in Bristol - as she understood them to be from the publicity - offered a better chance that she might be believed when accusing so famous and popular a man of so dreadful a crime.'  

Glitter is also accused of molesting two 'young fans' whom he met while touring the country. 

In each case, the girls are said to have first met the singer in his dressing room after a concert that their mothers took them to.

Jurors were told that each girl was initially introduced to Glitter in the presence of their mother, before their mother was persuaded to leave their daughter alone with the singer. 

One of the alleged victims claims she was just 12 when Glitter plied her with champagne and then set upon her after a 1977 concert in a Leicester club called Baileys. 

Glitter allegedly kissed the girl and 'touched her between the legs' after asking the schoolgirl's mother to leave them alone. 

Over time, the youngster attended a number of the former star's performances, the court was told.

On the second occasion she is said to have gone with her mother to Glitter's dressing room, before both of them were invited to his Holiday Inn hotel suite.

Mr Price told jurors: 'It was there, in his hotel bedroom, her mother having been taken elsewhere by someone else, that she says he subjected her to a prolonged episode of sexual abuse involving a full range of sexual activity culminating in intercourse, prior to which he plied her with alcohol - champagne.'

He added that consent was not an issue because the girl, now a 50-year-old woman, was a child at the time. 

Jurors also heard that the teenager was subjected to a similar ordeal in a Birmingham hotel room when she was 13, an age that she remembers because it coincided with her first period.

Mr Price continued: 'There is no doubt that (she) did attend concerts performed by this defendant.

'There can be no doubt that she was allowed the privilege - if that is what it was - of joining him backstage, as they sometimes say. She has produced a number of old photographs which prove it.' 

Jurors were then shown a number of photos of the young girl with her mother and with Glitter. Some of the photos showed bottles of champagne in ice buckets.

Glitter found fame in the 1970s as part of the glam rock scene and had number one hits with I'm The Leader Of The Gang (I Am), I Love You Love Me Love and Always Yours.

The former popstar also featured in a scene with Nineties stars the Spice Girls in their hit movie Spice World. 

He has suffered from hearing loss and followed proceedings with the help of lip-speaking interpreters.

Glitter is accused of one count of attempted rape and another of indecent assault on the eight-year-old girl, while she was under the age of 13. 

In relation to a second complainant, he is charged with four counts of indecent assault between 31 January 1977 and 31 December 1977, while she was under the age of 13.

He is also accused of plying the girl with alcohol with the intention to 'stupefy or overpower' her to have sex with him between January and May 1977. 

He faces one charge of unlawful intercourse with the girl, while she was aged under 13.

Glitter  faces two further charges of indecent assault relating to a third complainant, who was under the age of 16, between October 1979 and December 1980.  

Glitter, from Marylebone, central London, denies seven counts of indecent assault, one count of attempted rape, and two other sexual offences.

The trial, expected to last for two weeks, continues.
