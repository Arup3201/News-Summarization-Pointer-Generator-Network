An honest builder who handed in nearly £18,000 in cash to police after he found it stashed in a fire-damaged flat will go without any reward following a High Court judge's ruling.

Steven Fletcher found the hoard of 'neatly bundled' notes in a metal box in a burnt-out property he was renovating in King Street, Leicester, in September 2011.

The £17,940 cash haul - all in £20 notes and neatly packaged into £1,000 bundles - was concealed under a kitchen unit.

The flat had been empty since a fire gutted it six months earlier and Mr Fletcher immediately handed in his find to police.

But a High Court judge has ruled Mr Fletcher does not have any right to the cash after police failed to trace its origins.

Honest: Builder Steven Fletcher found nearly £18,000 in £20 notes hidden in a burnt-out property he was renovating in Leicester and handed it in to police

'Mr Fletcher is an honest man,' noted Mr Justice Lewis, who added: 'He took the find, as any honest person would, to the police.'

Police experts and forensic analysts examined the mysterious hoard. Drug-testing was, however, 'inconclusive', although some notes showed minute traces of cocaine.

Magistrates nevertheless ordered forfeiture of the cash under the Proceeds of Crime Act after Leicestershire's Chief Constable, Simon Cole, successfully argued that it probably came from 'unlawful criminal conduct'.

That decision was later confirmed at Leicester Crown Court.

Ruling: Steven Fletcher challenged the forfeiture of the cash under the Proceeds of Crime Act after the origin of the money was never discovered but a High Court judge ruled the money should be confiscated

Mr Fletcher, who was left without a penny from his find even though no-one else had laid claim to the cash, challenged the money's forfeiture at the High Court, insisting there was no evidence to link it to the criminal underworld.

However, Mr Justice Lewis said the careful sorting of the notes into bundles of one denomination meant they were 'unlikely to be the profits of legitimate cash trading'. The fact that the cash had been hidden and never reclaimed was also suspicious.

The judge left Mr Fletcher with only a tribute to his honesty as he backed the money's forfeiture to the public purse.

'In my judgment the crown court was entitled to infer that the money was obtained by unlawful conduct of an unidentifiable kind,' he concluded.
