A cyclist was knocked to the ground after being 'doored' while riding down a busy Australian street - and then abused by the passengers responsible.

The female cyclist was riding along the inside lane of Collins St in Melbourne when the rear door of a taxi opened, causing her to crash heavily to the ground.

The footage, captured by a camera mounted on the handlebars of the bicycle, shows her riding past several cars before the taxi door is flung open.

Caught on camera: A cyclist riding through the streets of Melbourne was knocked to the ground after being 'doored', and then abused by the passengers responsible.

In the video, the woman immediately demands that the taxi's three passengers hand over their details, telling them 'I’ve got it all on camera'.

One of the men apologies, but another tells her riding was 'dangerous'.

All three men refuse to give their names.

'Do you know what you just did? You just doored me. That’s an offence,' the cyclist said.

She pursues them along Collins St towards Swanston St, and they begin to abuse her.

'You ride up the inside of a car that’s stopped at the lights — you are a fool,' one man said.

That was followed by: 'The way people like you ride around is disgusting.'

Ignored: The cyclist demanded the men's details before being abused

'It's not an offence': Once the male passengers get out of the taxi, they tell the cyclist that they had done nothing wrong and refused to give out their details

Cycling advocates say the action clearly amounted to an offence, known as 'dooring'.

Victoria Police are now investigating the incident after a 65-year-old man from Brighton contacted them after seeing the video footage on the news, she said.

Victorian Greens leader Greg Barber told 7 News the footage was 'distressing'.

'The really distressing part is that those men are arguing with the cyclist, saying she is in the wrong, when they are at fault,' Mr Barber said.

Victoria’s road rules state that it is an offence, punishable by a fine of more than $350, to cause a hazard to a person or vehicle by opening a car door.
