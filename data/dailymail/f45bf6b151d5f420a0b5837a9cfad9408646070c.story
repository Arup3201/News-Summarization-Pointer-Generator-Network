Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon today warned Alex Salmond she would be in charge of any negotiations with Labour to form a Coalition after the next election.

The SNP leader, who is not standing for Westminster, dismissed suggestions Mr Salmond would act as a back seat driver if he is elected to Westminster in May.

But  at a rare appearance in Westminster this afternoon Ms Sturgeon said she would 'lead the position' in any talks with other parties in the event of another hung parliament. Asked who would lead the negotiations, she replied: 'Me'.

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, who is not standing for Westminster, dismissed suggestions Alex Salmond would control Coalition negotiations with Labour in the event of another hung Parliament

Pressed on what role Mr Salmond might play, she said: 'If Alex is elected - as I would be fairly confident in predicting he will be - then Alex will be a key part of the team in Westminster and, of course, will have a part to play.

'But I am the party leader, Stewart is the deputy of leader of the party, and we will lead the position.'

It comes after she claimed Britain would be better run if Scottish Nationalists sat in the Cabinet with Labour.

The SNP leader said the majority of Scots want Labour to have to share power after May's general election, which she said would lead to 'more progressive decisions for the whole of the UK'.

She boasted that she wanted to make sure 'Scotland's voice is heard loudly at Westminster.' A string of opinion polls suggest the SNP will make big gains on May 7, robbing Ed Miliband of an overall majority and forcing him into a Westminster coalition with Miss Sturgeon's party.

A huge row erupted last week when the SNP announced its MPs planned to vote on laws which only affect England, including the running of the NHS.

Miss Sturgeon claimed her MPs in Westminster would take part in any votes which had an impact on Scotland, claiming the repeal of NHS reforms imposed by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition would have UK-wide repercussions.

Tory defence minister Anna Soubry branded the remarks 'complete twaddle' and warned Ms Sturgeon was putting the Union at risk again.

A Survation poll for the Daily Record newspaper revealed that 35.1 per cent of Scottish voters would prefer to see a deal between Labour and the SNP

The latest IpsosMORI opinion poll suggests the SNP could will an incredible 55 of Scotland's 59 seats, with Scottish Labour reduced to a rump of only four MPs - with the Tories and the Lib Dems completely wiped out

But Miss Sturgeon today vowed that the SNP will vote on English tax issues and claimed a Labour government dependent on SNP support would be fairer for the whole of the UK.

She told BBC One's Andrew Marr show on Sunday: 'If you look at polls in Scotland, as well as showing a substantial SNP lead they show that the most popular outcome in Scotland in the general election is a Labour government dependent on SNP support,' she said.

'Because I think people recognise that would lead to better decisions that were not just, perhaps, in the interests of Scotland but more progressive decisions for the whole of the UK.'

Miss Sturgeon, who took over as Scottish First Minister after Alex Salmond stood down, said she will also seek alliances with parties such as Plaid Cymru and the Green Party to be a 'progressive force in the House of Commons'.

'I think the Westminster establishment really needs some progressive forces at its heart,' she added.

'I want Scotland to become independent, you have probably noticed that over the past wee while, but that will only happen when a majority of Scotland want that to happen.

'In the interim, what is really important is Scotland's voice is heard loudly at Westminster.'

An Ipsos Mori poll for STV News last week found 52 per cent of Scots are planning to vote SNP in May.

That would give the Nationalists an incredible 55 of Scotland's 59 seats, with Scottish Labour reduced to a rump of only four MPs - with the Tories and the Lib Dems completely wiped out.

It would shatter Labour's hopes of an overall majority, and would leave Ed Miliband reliant on SNP votes to pass laws - including those which only affect England.

Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy has not ruled out working with the SNP after the general election.

But the East Renfrewshire MP said 'it would be wrong' to back the abolition of the Trident nuclear deterrent in exchange for SNP votes.

His deputy Kezia Dugdale MSP she said she would 'no qualms whatsoever' about going into partnership with the SNP after the May election.

Speaking on the BBC's Politics Scotland, Mr Murphy said: 'I think it's important that parties work together, it happens all across Scotland in local authorities, but what Kez is talking about is the same thing that I've been talking about which is that we're not expecting, we're not planning, we don't want, and we don't need a coalition with the SNP.

'The fact is that come the UK election here in Scotland in May it's really a choice of whether David Cameron hangs on to power or whether we can get David Cameron out of Downing Street, and by voting SNP, unfortunately, a lot of Scots if they do so, run the risk that by accident they ensure that David Cameron holds onto power.'
