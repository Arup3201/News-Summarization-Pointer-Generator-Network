A former Newcastle United chairman has unveiled plans to put on a display in the north of England in a bid to save the Natural History Museum's famous dinosaur.

Freddy Shepherd, an offshore energy tycoon, has written to museum bosses to ask if he can display Dippy the diplodocus in the Palace of Arts in Newcastle's Exhibition Park.

The 83ft-long cast is due to be moved from its prime position in the entrance hall at the South Kensington museum and replaced with a giant blue whale skeleton.

Boss: Freddy Shepherd has written to museum bosses asking to display Dippy the diplodocus at the Palace of Arts in Newcastle's Exhibition Park, which he recently bought and plans to rename St James' Hall

Display: The Natural History Museum revealed this week that the 83ft-long cast will be moved from its prime position in the entrance hall and replaced with a blue whale skeleton as part of modernisation programme

It was revealed this week that museum bosses no longer considered Dippy to be relevant and its marine replacement would act as a reminder of 'our responsibility to the planet'.

But the decision has triggered thousands of people to sign a petition calling for it to remain where it has enthralled millions for the past 110 years. 

So far, more than 26,000 people have signed the 'Save Dippy' campaign, which states that his removal would lead to 'many unhappy faces in UK youth'.

Mr Shepherd, who recently bought the Tyneside venue, has pledged to save the dinosaur skeleton by bringing it to North East England, attracting thousands of visitors to the area.

Geordie-saur: Mr Shepherd, a former Newcastle United chairman, said his Tyneside venue - with its 100ft dome - would be 'perfect' for the replica dinosaur Dippy

He said: 'It would go perfect in the museum, we've had the plans out today and it would fit perfect.

'We've sent an email to the National History Museum saying we were interested in the future of the dinosaur and if they wish to get rid of it or move it we would be interested in taking it in.

'The Palace of Arts is a huge museum and Newcastle would be capable of taking it.'

He added: 'They [Natural History Museum] wouldn't be able to take it around many places because of its length. 

'The Hancock museum couldn't take it but I want to take it, it would be fantastic for Newcastle. It would attract so many visitors to Exhibition Park. People would come from all over to see it.

'We have the Rugby World Cup here this year and it would be great for the city.'

The Diplodocus skeleton, in the main central hall of the Natural History Museum, will remain until 2017

Dippy arrived in London in 1905 after King Edward VII saw an illustration of the original skeleton, which was unearthed in Wyoming in 1898 - currently on display at a museum in Pittsburgh - and asked for a copy.

It has since become a favourite attraction for millions of people who visit the museum in South Kensington every year.

However, as part of a 10-year modernisation programme, the museum plans to take it off display. 

The Natural History Museum holds over 80million specimens, including mammoth skeletons and items from the voyages of Charles Darwin and Captain James Cook.

The museum has a moon rock brought back from the Apollo 17 mission, the only piece in the UK.

It keeps a 900-strong colony of tiny flesh-eating beetles, which it uses to strip carcasses down to skeletons for study or display.

The most valued fossil in the museum's collection is the archaeopteryx, or the 'first bird', which is 150million years old.

The skeleton, which contains 356 plaster-cast bones, was constructed over a period of 18 months and shipped to England in 36 crates.

Originally installed in the Reptile Gallery, Dippy was taken apart and stored in the museum's basement during the Blitz to avoid any damage.

In 1979 it was rebuilt and given pride of place in the central hall, becoming the museum's most famous asset.

Dippy will remain in place until summer 2017 when the whale, previously the centrepiece of the Mammal Hall, will be suspended from the vaulted ceiling of the Hintze Hall.

The whale has been at the museum since 1981 after it beached itself in Wexford Harbour in Ireland and was bought for £250 by a local merchant.

Mr Shepherd added: 'The dome is around 100ft tall so it would fit in there no problem.

'We're giving them a chance to bring it to Newcastle and here is as good as anywhere else.' 

In a £500,000 refurbishment scheme, Mr Shepherd and his brother Bruce have transformed the venue by replacing windows, restoring the original flooring and carrying out maintenance.

Symbol of hope: The whale, previously the centrepiece of the Mammal Hall, and a resident of the museum since 1891, will be suspended in a diving motion from the ceiling of the central Hintze Hall

The whale was found near Thurso, Scotland, in 1863, and two years later its skeleton was presented to the Museum by Captain D. Macdonald, but campaigners are calling for it not to replace Dippy 

Newcastle City's Lord Mayor's carriage is currently on display at the museum, along with a Newcastle United-themed tuk tuk bought at the Alan Shearer Foundation Ball this month.

The venue will also house Mr Shepherd's collection of historic horse-drawn carriages which he bought at Seaton Delaval Hall in Northumberland after they were put up for auction by Lord Hastings.

His collection of vintage cars, including a vehicle once owned by King George V, who was patron of the North East Coast Exhibition, which was took place in the park in 1929, will also be displayed.

The 7.7-litre Rolls Royce Phantom II spent decades in a private dealer's collection in the United States.

The Natural History Museum (pictured in 1882) welcomes more than five million visitors a year. It also operates as a world-leading research centre
