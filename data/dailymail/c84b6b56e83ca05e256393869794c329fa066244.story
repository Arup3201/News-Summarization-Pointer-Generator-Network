Hull manager Steve Bruce believes Andy Robertson 'has the world at his feet' after his starring role against England.

The 20-year-old left-back left Dundee United in the summer for a modest £2.85million and has rapidly become one of the rising stars of the Barclays Premier League.

He has excelled in his early Tigers performances and earned a whole new level of exposure by starring for Scotland in the recent international break.

Robertson was a stand-out performer in the 1-0 win over the Republic of Ireland and went on to score a fine goal in the friendly defeat by the old enemy on Tuesday.

Admiring glances and lofty praise has followed in the wake of those performances, and Bruce was in no mood to downplay them ahead of Sunday's clash with Tottenham.

'He is a truly fantastic young talent who can only get better. He's a wonderfully gifted young lad who's got the world at his feet,' the Hull boss said.

'He's gone from playing second division football in Scotland to scoring a goal against England in a couple of years. A 20-year-old lad playing one-twos past England players and smashing it in the bottom corner - that will stay with him for a long time, being the proud Scot he is.'

Having arrived at Hull with little immediate expectation, despite having a breakthrough season in the Scottish top flight behind him, Robertson's next challenge is living up to the added attention he has garnered in recent weeks.

But, having been impressed by his character, Bruce has no fears on that front.

'It's our job to keep him working at it and improving and, if he does, we have one of the game's outstanding young players here at Hull,' he added.

'The next step is always difficult because of the expectation, but we're delighted with the way he's matured and developed.

'It's my job to make sure I keep his feet on the ground and we'll try and look after him as best as we can.

'He's sensible, he's dedicated and he has a wonderful future ahead of him - no question about it.'

For his own part, Robertson is keen not to get carried away.

It would be easy to do so, having been a part-timer with Queen's Park in as recently as 18 months ago and having spent just one season in the Scottish top division before Hull came calling.

But, while others were quick to lavish him with praise, he was quick to point out areas he could still improve.

'It's been a massive rise for me, but you don't look back - you look forward,' he said.

'It meant a lot to score against England - it was called a friendly but it was far from it - but I could only enjoy it for a minute or two before (Wayne) Rooney made it 3-1 to seal the game.

'But really I was more disappointed with my defensive play. I would have swapped the goal for a clean sheet any day of the week.

'My game has definitely come on a lot, but there's plenty to improve on.

'I'm still working on the training ground, trying to get tips on the defensive side and practising crossing and picking people out.

'You're never the finished article - you've got to keep improving.'
