Tennessee state Senator Jim Summerville has been arrested on assault and stalking charges

Tennessee state Senator Jim Summerville is facing stalking and assault charges, a month after being arrested for public intoxication.

The Dickson Police Department on Friday night arrested Summerville on a stalking charge filed by a neighbor and released on bail.

Police said Summerville was arrested again on Saturday for assault after threatening the same neighbor. He was released on $10,000 bond.

Neighbor Cecilia Donaven says she's filed several reports against the senator.

'We always have to have our guard up,' she told WSMV. 'It's no way for anyone to have to live.'

'As intelligent as he is, he has no respect for the law or his neighbors,' she added.

Donaven says Summerville often shines flashlights into her dining room.

'Every minute I'm in this house, he's watching me,' Donaven told WSMV.

'Every minute, he wants to see what I'm doing.'

In September, Summerville was charged with public intoxication after police said he sat in several residents' yards drinking while uninvited.

Summerville denies the charges says he will sue the city of Dickson once his case is resolved in court

As for the latest charges, police didn't provide details.

Summerville said in a statement that he's being harassed and plans to sue the Dickson Police Department.

'The City of Dickson Police Department is engaging a systematic campaign of harassment,' he said. 

'(Stalking! At my age?) Once these charges are resolved in court, I shall be suing the City of Dickson. Settlement negotiations will start at one million dollars.'

Summerville resigned from the Republican Caucus in August after a loss in the Aug. 7 election primary. His term ends following the Nov. 4 general election.

His behavior and controversial legislation have made headlines on several occasions during his term.

Last year, he proposed a measure to eliminate affirmative action initiatives from higher education institutions in Tennessee. After the legislation failed, Summerville threatened GOP lawmakers who voted against it, saying they would face repercussions in this year's election.

Summerville also was heavily criticized for an email he sent insulting the Legislature's black caucus.

In the email to then-black caucus chairwoman Barbara Cooper, he wrote: 'I don't give a rat's ass what the black caucus thinks.'

The email was sent after the caucus issued a news release critical of a hearing, led by Summerville, that looked into allegations of grade tampering at Tennessee State University.

Summerville later apologized for the email.
