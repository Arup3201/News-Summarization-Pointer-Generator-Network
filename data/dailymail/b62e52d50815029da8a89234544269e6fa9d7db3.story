Former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason has apologized for blasting New York Mets player Daniel Murphy for missing the first two games of the season while on paternity leave.

Esiason flippantly declared on his WFAN morning radio show yesterday that Murphy's wife, Victoria, should have had a C-section before the opening day so her second baseman husband could play baseball.

'I'm sorry that he (Murphy) had to go through that. No man should have to go through that,' Esiason said on the Boomer & Carton show this morning, according to Jezebel.

'And certainly Daniel Murphy, who we both admire much as a baseball player as anybody else - and all I can say is that I truly, truly, feel terrible about what I put them through. So for that I certainly apologize.'

Esaison also said he was sorry for putting the Murphys' private life under the spotlight following the birth of their first child and that he was 'not telling women what to do with their bodies'.

'I just want to say again on this radio show that in no way, shape or form was I advocating anything for anybody to do,' he said.

The football great said he reached out 29-year-old Murphy, whose son Noah was born on March 31, through intermediaries at the Mets.

Although Murphy
 is allowed one to three days off, according to a provision in the 2011 
collective bargaining agreement between owners and the player’s union, Esiason took him to task for taking paternity leave.

Esiason argued Murphy should have forced his wife to ‘have a C-section before the season starts’ because he needs ‘to be at opening day.’

His co-host, Craig Carton agreed, saying ‘assuming the birth went well, the wife is fine, the baby is fine, 24 hours and then you get your ass back to your team and you play baseball.’

'That’s my take on it,' Carton continued. 'There’s nothing you can do anyway, you’re not breastfeeding the kid.'

Esiasion ended his rant by saying '(men) don’t have the plumbing to take care of what needs to be taken care of.'

However, Murphy said he is proud he put fatherhood ahead of baseball.

He said staying in Florida an extra day was 'the right decision to make' following his wife Victoria's cesarean section and said 'we felt the best thing for our family was for me to stay'.

He learned Sunday that his wife's water broke, then traveled to Florida and missed Monday's 9-7 opening loss to Washington and Wednesday night's 5-1 defeat. He said his son was born at 12.02pm Monday.

'I appreciate it, anyone who supports me,' he said. 'My wife and I, we made a decision, and we were excited about it.'

Murphy said his son was named after the Biblical character Noah, not for Mets teammate Noah Syndergaard.

'People
 are going to say you named him after the monstrosity that throws like 
1,000 miles an hour,' Murphy said. 'We didn't. Noah came from Noah's 
Ark. Peace and rest is what it means.'

Murphy said he took the shockjocks' comments in his stride, including those of afternoon host Mike Francesa.

‘One
 day I understand. And in the old days they didn’t do that. But one day,
 go see the baby be born and come back,’ Francesa said during his afternoon program yesterday.

‘You’re a Major League Baseball player. You can hire a nurse to take care of the baby if your wife needs help...

‘I had three kids... I was at the birth and was back to work the next day. I didn’t see any reason not to be working.

'I’d rather go out and get a couple of hits if I was a player. That’s the best thing I can do. Go play. Go make some money - you just had a kid.'

Francesa boasted that one of his three children was born at 9am and he was behind the mic that afternoon.

He called the idea of fathers not being at work a ‘scam’ and a ‘gimmick’ when informed his own radio station allows fathers 10 days out of the office to tend to the mother of their children after a birth.

‘That's ridiculous, what the heck do you need 10 days for? What are you supposed to be doing, vacationing?’ he said.

However Mets executives defended the paternity leave policy, with manager Terry Collins bristling at the radio hosts' comments.

'If you're accusing Dan Murphy of not wanting to play - this guy played 161 games last year, wore himself out, played through all sorts of discomfort,' he said.

'You know, the man had his first child. He's allowed to be there. The rules state that he can be there, so he went. There's nothing against it.

'There's nothing wrong with it. You know, he missed two games. It's not like he's missed 10. You know, when you start attacking Dan Murphy's credibility, you need to look in the mirror a little bit.'
