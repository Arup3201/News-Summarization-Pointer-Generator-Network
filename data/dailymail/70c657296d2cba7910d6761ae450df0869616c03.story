Millions of Britons holiday in the same place year after year – often even when they don’t particularly like it, a survey found. 

And only two thirds actually say it is because they like the destination they are returning to time after time. 

Many go back because it is the easy option, gets the fewest complaints from the family and is cheap or simple to reach.

Some 59 per cent of us go on the same holiday in successive years, according to the research. Around 12 per cent have been back six or more times in the past ten years.

But only 68 per cent say they go back because they love the place, while one in five admit they only go because a partner or someone else has persuaded them. 

Many Britons say they would like to try something new but are put off by price or increased travelling time.

Cruise specialists Royal Caribbean questioned 2,000 adults for the survey.

One in five (22 per cent) go to the same place again and again because it is cheap and 26 per cent say it is the place which seems to keep everyone happy.

But as a result 30 per cent of Brits miss out on ever going on what they would describe as their 'dream' holiday'.

For most, the definition of a dream holiday involves going somewhere new and further away than usual and in luxury accommodation.

Many Britons say they would like to try something new but find excuses not to with 45 per cent claiming to be put off by price and 23 per cent by increased travelling time.

And an unadventurous 14 per cent say they do not want to try something new in case it doesn't work out, so they stick to what they know!

Jo Briody of Royal Caribbean said: 'Make this the year to try something different! If you've never considered it, a cruise holiday truly offers something for everyone without the need to compromise.

'As well as the exciting excursions we offer, there are a host of unique experiences on board, which travellers would never expect from a cruise ship, including sky diving simulation, robotic bartenders and even bumper cars at sea.

'With so much choice available, there's no reason not to get out of that holiday rut.'
