Sitting patiently in a flow of rushing water, the mighty predator spots the only dish on the menu, as a salmon swims past.

This hungry coastal brown bear was photographed by American photographer Nick Kalathas, 57, on a visit to the Katmai National Park, Alaska.

Mr Kalathas, of Pennsylvania, said: 'This brown bear was busy fishing for salmon to eat as his next snack.'

'Salmon annually migrate upstream to spawn, and the bears anxiously wait for this moment as they know a lot of food is coming their way.

'When visiting such a magical place such as Katmai National Park, it is easy to experience a plethora of emotions.

'I felt humbled, excited, nervous, frightened and thankful while photographing the bear.

'Living, walking and working among the bears, it would be difficult not to have so many emotional peaks when being so close to such a powerful and potentially dangerous animal.'

With an average of 40 to 70 bears in the area for the salmon spawning run, Nick stayed at Katmai National Park for a week photographing the bears.

Hunter: Despite their enormous size, the brown bear has keen sense and ferocious speed enabling it to snatch fish from the water

The park covers 4,093,077 acres, which is roughly the size of Wales, and has some of the highest bear density and largest brown bears in the world.

Nick says: 'I get a very positive reaction to my bear photographs, as most people find bears fascinating.

'We are amazed at their strength, their agility, their loving attendance to their young, and to their power, unpredictability and ferocity that they possess.

'As a nature and wildlife photographer I am very concerned that we must do everything we can to preserve and maintain these wonderful ecosystems for all future generations.

'I can only hope that my photography helps in a small way to remind and make people aware that these wonderful, special, and fragile ecosystems need to be preserved.'
