It is said the harder you work, the luckier you get.

Heather Watson, who has grafted as much as anyone this year, got her break when she was gifted a walkover to the semi-final of the Aegon International in Eastbourne.

Watson, 22, was changing into her match kit when she learned that her opponent, Wimbledon Champion Petra Kvitova, was withdrawing with a thigh injury.

All smiles: Watson is the first Briton in 32 years to reach the semi-finals in Eastbourne

‘It’s never happened to me before, to get a walkover,’ said Watson.

‘Petra told me herself she wouldn’t be playing. I wished her luck in recovering for Wimbledon, she wished me well for the rest of the tournament.’  

Watson, who has battled back up the rankings after an illness-hit 2013, will play Madison Keys, the big-hitting 19-year-old American who bundled her out in the first round of Wimbledon last year.

It is the first time a Briton has reached the last four of the pre-Wimbledon tournament since Jo Durie in 1982. Watson hopes to do better than Durie, who was beaten by Martina Navratilova.

It is only the second time that Watson has reached the last four of a WTA tour singles tournament. The first culminated in her winning the Japan Open in October 2012.  

Diego Veronelli, coach of the British No 1, watched as Watson’s opponent Keys, ranked 47 in the world, obliterated her compatriot Lauren Davis 6-2, 6-1.
