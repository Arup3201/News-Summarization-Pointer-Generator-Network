For nearly three years we have waited for the pitter patter of tiny paws. Soon, that wait could be over.

Experts are confident that giant panda Tian Tian – whose name means Sweetie – is pregnant and may produce Britain’s first panda cub by the end of the month.

Public interest in the panda and her mate Yang Guang, or Sunshine, reached fever pitch yesterday, undimmed by two previous unsuccessful breeding attempts.

The pair, on loan to Edinburgh Zoo from China, refused to mate in 2012, while last year Tian Tian had a failed pregnancy.

Tian Tian the panda is pregnant and could give birth by the end of August, keepers at Edinburgh Zoo say 

The Giant Panda, who came to Scotland in 2011, was artificially inseminated last year but lost the cub at late term

This time scientists hope they could 
finally see the first panda cub – or even twins or triplets – born in 
Britain. Keepers have been monitoring Tian Tian since she was 
artificially inseminated in April.

Iain
 Valentine, director of pandas at the zoo, said the latest scientific 
data suggested that Tian Tian is pregnant and her due date is likely to 
be around August 28 or 29.

But
 he warned: ‘This is all very new and complex science and we still have a
 bit of time to go yet, as like last year, the late loss of a cub 
remains entirely possible.’

Last
 year keepers tried to inseminate Tian Tian with a frozen sample of 
sperm from a dead panda, Bao Bao, which had been kept at Berlin zoo.

The
 foetus was not carried to full term. The latest attempt used sperm from
 Yang Guang.

If the 
pregnancy is successful, it could mean a £50million boost to the 
Scottish economy, studies suggest – and put Scotland firmly into the 
international spotlight weeks before the independence referendum on 
September 18.

A team of up 
to nine people will be on hand to help deliver the cub, including two 
experts due to arrive from China next week

Mr Valentine said: ‘We’re 
very excited. We know she is now pregnant from the tests that we have 
been running. It is not a phantom pregnancy.

‘We
 are using a combination of tests which give an indication of when 
implantation has taken place.

'The keepers noticed that there were 
behavioural changes, she started to become less co-operative and wanted 
to spend less time eating and more in the cubbing box.

'That also ties in
 with the science.

‘We don’t
 know how many cubs there are. We know at least one – we don’t know 
whether there is another one in there, or another two.’

While
 giant pandas are famously reluctant to mate, both in captivity and in 
the wild, and pregnancies often fail even if they do, Tian Tian has had 
cubs in the past in China.

She
 and Yang Guang arrived on loan from China in December 2011 following 
five years of talks between officials and became the first giant pandas 
to live in the UK for 17 years.

The
 animals, both aged ten, will remain at Edinburgh Zoo for a decade. 
Under the terms of the agreement any cubs will return to China at the 
age of two, the age at which they would normally leave their mother in 
the wild.

To the dismay of visitors, the Giant Panda will not be on show during her pregnancy which could see her give birth to a cub at the end of this month

Meanwhile, in China: Pink and mostly hairless, these panda triplets are the latest success for China's artificial breeding programme
