A South Korean demonstrator stabbed himself in the stomach at a rally calling on Japan to issue an official apology for its actions during the Second World War.

Kim Chang-geun, 57, a member of an anti-Japan group, plunged the knife into his stomach at Gimpo Airport in Seoul, South Korea, today.

The protest was organised to coincide with the arrival in the country of the special envoy of Shinzo Abe, Japan's conservative new prime minister.

Photographs show the stoical 57-year-old clasping the blood-stained knife and looking around him at the airport, before wincing as he is eventually led away by police officers.

Abe's envoy was to meet with South Korea's president-elect Park Guen-hye for discussions aimed at soothing tensions over disputed islands that lie roughly half way between the two nations.

Both countries lay claim to the islands, which are known as Dokdo in South Korea and Takeshima in Japan.

The small islands lie within fishing grounds which may contain large gas deposits.

The protestor, who was seen with blood covering his hands, was taken to hospital in Seoul to be treated for his injury.
