A newly married man is claiming that his model wife and a newly married former football star have been having an affair.

Brian Holloway says that his wife, Alicia Tarry, and footballer Keyshawn Johnson have been having an affair, and is seeking an annulment of his six month marriage.

This all comes just four months after Johnson's own wedding to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two of his two children, Jennifer Conrad.

Heated exchange: One direct message shows someone writing, 'Send me a p**** shot'

In court papers obtained by TMZ, Holloway claims he went through his wife's Twitter direct messages, and found numerous exchanges between her and Johsnon, including a request for a graphic nude photo.

'Send me a p**** shot,' one direct message says.

'I'll get one in a few sorry have a guest over,' the other person responds.

Tarry says she did not have an affair with Johnson, and that these messages were 'illegally obtained.'

Johnson seems to echo this statement, with a source saying he has 'no idea what the guy's  talking about.'

Johnson, who played for the New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Dallas Cowboys and Carolina Panthers before retiring in 2007 to become an analyst and enjoy a very brief stint on Dancing With the Stars, was married in August in an oceanfront ceremony in Newport Beach, California.

Holloway and Tarry got engaged last December according to Facebook, and were married in May.

The two live in Beverly Hills.
