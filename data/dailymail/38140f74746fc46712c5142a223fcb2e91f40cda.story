Nick Clegg today insisted Vince Cable was not potting to topple him as Lib Dem leader, as senior party figures accused the Business Secretary of ‘treachery’.

Mr Clegg said he had been reassured personally by Mr Cable that he did not know his close friend and ally Lord Oakeshott was bankrolling a series of polls designed to prove the Lib Dems were doomed with him still as leader.

In an attempt to draw a line under the threat to his position, Mr Clegg put on a confident display during his weekly radio phone-in, denying he had cried after his election drubbing and demonstrating to Ed Miliband how to eat a bacon sandwich.

But Mr Cable continues to face questions about why he failed to inform the party high command about the activities of Lord Oakeshott, who dramatically quit yesterday after his plotting was exposed.

Lord Oakeshott, Mr Cable’s closest ally and holiday partner, warned that the party is ‘heading for disaster’ under Mr Clegg.

And he claimed Mr Cable knew all about secret polling he commissioned in Lib Dem seats to show they would do better without Mr Clegg as leader.

It followed Mr Cable’s insistence that the ordering the polling was ‘utterly reprehensible’.

Last night the Business Secretary was forced to break off from a trade visit to China to deny again having knowledge of his friend’s plot.

Today Mr Clegg insisted that he believed his colleague, as he desperately tried to move on from the most damaging period of his turbulent time leadership.

But he was forced to deny crying before giving an emotional interview in the wake of dire local and European election results, as the row about the future direction of the Lib Dems threatens to split the party in two. 

Plotter: Lord Oakeshott emerged from his home this morning, the first time he has been seen in public since his attempts to undermine Mr Clegg were exposed

Nick Clegg today denied he had been crying before an emotional interview in the wake of his elections bloodbath,

The Lib Dems lost more than 300 councillors and all but one of its MEPs in local and European elections.

As the scale of the devastation became clear, and calls from activists grew for him to resign, Mr Clegg gave a TV interview in which he appeared emotional.

With bloodshot eyes he said the results were 'gutting' but refused to quit.

Asked if he had been crying, Mr Clegg insisted: 'Of course not.'

When it was suggested by LBC host Nick Ferrari  'your eyes were red', he responded 'were they?' before trying to change the subject.

The Deputy Prime Minister insisted he did not believe ‘for a second’ that Mr Cable had been behind the plot to force him out of the party's top job.

During his regular Call Clegg show on LBC he said: ‘He was absolutely not aware of polls elsewhere. He has made it very, very clear that he, for instance, didn't want any questions about leadership in the poll which he did have some control over in his own constituency.

‘So, look I fully expect that people will try and suggest that there are endless plots and conspiracies. I don't believe that for a second. Vince is an outstanding Secretary of State for Business.

‘He and I have worked together for years and years and years and we are going to continue to work together in harness as part of a really strong Lib Dem team in government. Full stop.’

Mr Clegg insisted the Business Secretary is fully supportive of his leadership and the pair speak daily.

‘He supports me, he has said so and will no doubt say so again,’ he added.

But when asked if the Lib Dems were heading for disaster under Mr Clegg, Mr Cable replied: ‘I'm not going to give ad hoc answers.’

However, Mr Cable has faced intense criticism for his failure to tell Mr Clegg what he knew about the polling work being carried out by Lord Oakeshott.

He admits knowing about polls in his own Twickenham seat and in Wells in Somerset, and knew that Lord Oakeshott was looking to establish if the party would perform better without Mr Clegg at the helm.

Sir Graham Watson, who lost his seat as an MEP in last week's elections, said Mr Cable had shown 'treachery' by not ordering friend to halt the polling immediately.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Of course it is the case that sometimes we can be as treacherous as our failure to stop something as we can by being involved but Vince Cable s doing an incredibly taxing and busy job and nobody believes that he is trying undermine Nick.

'Maybe he should have said to Matthew Oakeshott, very early on, "Matthew this is not a good idea, don’t do it and if you want to do it my constituency fine, but don’t do it elsewhere." Clearly he didn’t.'
