The Brooklyn Cherry King who shot himself dead on Tuesday was able to hide his massive marijuana business thanks to his cherries.

Arthur Mondella, 57, was able to keep investigators in the dark  as the smell of the 400,000 pounds of Maraschino cherries his plant processed each week managed to mask the stench of the up to 1,200 marijuana plants he was capable of growing.

Furthermore, the other red flag for authorities would have been the heightened electric bill from running grow lamps - something that was also masked by his large operation.

This as many still have questions as to why the president of Dell's Maraschino Cherries, after cooperating with investigators for five hours Tuesday as they looked in to claims that his business was dumping hazardous waste, excused himself, asked his sister Joanne Capece to 'take care of [his] kids,' and then shot himself dead in his private bathroom.

The New York Daily News reports that investigators then discovered a crawl space that led to a 50-foot-by-50-foot area that was divided into several rooms. Authorities now believe the rooms were for growing the plans. One room contained seeds of 60 different marijuana strains and about $125,000 in cash.

They believe a crop had just been harvested, as only three bags with about 100 pounds of marijuana were discovered during their search. 

All that, along with 120 expensive grow lamps, were completely hidden, leading one source to speculate he could have been working alone and not with the help of others at the company.

'In theory, it could have been him and outsiders,' said the source. 

'This is a secreted part of a large factory that was designed so a large number of employees won’t know.'

Despite all this, the company, which has contracts with numerous national restaurant chains such as Red Lobster, Buffalo Wild Wings, Chick-fil-A and TGI Fridays, is back in business and family lawyer Michael Farkas states managers are cooperating fully with the District Attorney's investigation.

Mondella is survived by three children from two marriages.

His father, Arthur Mondella Sr, started the business as a Brooklyn storefront in 1948.
