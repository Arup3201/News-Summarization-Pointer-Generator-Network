The bank holiday weekend may have been awash with glorious sunshine, but the rest of the half term looks like its going to be more of a wash out.

Much of Britain has been hit with torrential downpours today, dampening the spirits of those going back to work after enjoying the bank holiday sun and delaying the start of the last day of the second test at Headingley between England and New Zealand.

And for those who were looking forward to a sunny half term, the outlook does not look great, with forecasters predicting showers and longer spells of rain for large parts of the country throughout the week.

Large parts of Britain have been hit with torrential downpours this morning and the rain is set to continue for much of the week

Meteogroup forecaster John Lee said the heaviest rain had fallen over central and southern parts of England, while 10mm of rain had fallen in parts of Buckinghamshire and Berkshire overnight.

He said: 'It's looking fairly cloudy and wet today and also quite a few degrees colder than it has been over the bank holiday weekend, so in general it is much more unsettled today with rain for many areas.

'It is probably central and southern England and parts of the Midlands which have seen the most rain.

'Looking ahead at the rest of the day, it's quite windy across the Midlands and the south which could see a further ten to 15mms of rain.

'It's not quite so wet elsewhere, I think northern Scotland and Northern Ireland are getting away with a mostly dry day today and in terms of sunshine, it's probably quite bright up there as well.'

The Met Office however has predicted a further 20mm of rain could fall in the Midlands and parts of Wales, while East Anglia, Lincolnshire and the north east of England could see up to 25mm of rain tonight.

Tomorrow however, it is expected to remain largely dry, with sunny periods, over north-west Scotland and Northern Ireland, although it will still be unsettled elsewhere with showers and longer spells of rain.

Mr Lee said: 'Tomorrow is a fairly similar prospect with more rain in places. The actual position of the rain is fairly uncertain at the moment, but in general it looks like eastern areas will be having the heaviest of the rain.

'Yet again, north west Scotland and northern Ireland are looking mostly dry.'

There could also be the odd rumble of thunder in among any of the heavy showers.

Showers are expected for much of the half term this week, although forecasters are hoping things will clear up a little by the end of the week

Looking further ahead, Thursday is looking like it is going to be a brighter day with scattered showers for England and Wales. Again, Scotland and Northern Ireland look like they will stay quite dry.

Mr Lee said: 'It looks quite promising towards the end of the week that most of the UK will be dry on Friday so, fingers-crossed, that will lead into a fairly decent weekend.'

Meanwhile, scientists at the Marine Conservation Society have said one of the most eagerly awaited visitors to the British shores may have been deterred by the long, chilly spring.

The scientists have said they have barely had any sightings of basking sharks so far in 2013, in contrast to a bumper crop last year.

Jean-Luc Solandt, the organisationâ€™s senior bio- diversity officer, said he believed it was because the water temperature is lower than usual for the time of year.

Despite the fact that the gentle giants of the sea can grow to the size of a double decker bus, they are still prone to feel the cold and even a few degrees can make a difference to their habits, he said.

'Divers are telling us that the water temperature is 10 or 11 degrees centigrade. But at this time of the year it should be nearer 13 degrees,' said Dr Solandt.

'This means that the plankton, which is the basking sharks favourite food and the reason they come to our waters, are not blooming in the usual quantities so basking sharks are staying in warmer seas to feed.'

After a six year wait, Britain's longest wisteria has finally burst into bloom. It took fifteen years to train the vine to grow along the full length of a giant garden wall in Essex
