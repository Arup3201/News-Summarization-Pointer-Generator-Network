India's Parliament today passed a sweeping new law to protect women against sexual violence in response to the fatal gang rape of a young bus passenger in New Delhi.

The law, which still requires the president's signature before it becomes official, makes stalking, voyeurism and sexual harassment a crime.

It also provides for the death penalty for repeat offenders or for rape attacks that lead to the victim's death.

Women's rights: The new law has been passed following nationwide protests sparked by the fatal gang rape of a young woman on a bus in New Delhi

Activists hailed the legislation as a milestone in India's women's rights movement, even as they raised concerns over some of its provisions as well as the country's poor record of law enforcement.

'It's a significant moment. We have taken many steps forward,' said Vrinda Grover, a senior lawyer and a women's rights activist.

But she added: 'Much, much more needs to be done.'

The bill was passed by the upper house of India's Parliament today - two days after the lower house approved it.

The law was hurried through Parliament after the gang rape on a young woman on December 16 sparked nationwide protests demanding the government do more to safeguard women.

The government set up a panel headed by a retired judge, which recommended sweeping changes to India's laws governing crimes against women.

The Cabinet quickly passed an ordinance incorporating some of those suggestions, but Parliament had to pass a new law by next month or the ordinance would have expired.

The protection of women in India also came under the spotlight when a Swiss tourists was raped while camping with her husband in Datia district last week.

In a separate incident this week, a hotel manager has been accused of attempting to rape a British holidaymaker in the northern city of Agra.
