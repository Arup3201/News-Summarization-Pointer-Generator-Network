On the run: Alan Watkins, 24, from Newport in South Wales, has been taunting police who are searching for him on Facebook after he breached his license conditions

A violent thug who is on the run from police has been poking fun at their attempts to catch him on Facebook - saying 'Catch me if you can.'

Fugitive Alan Watkins, 24, began taunting officers after an urgent appeal for information as to his whereabouts was posted on Gwent Police's Facebook page.

Watkins even posted the appeal on his own page, boasting: 'Wow, I'm on the Gwent police site. You catch me if you can - do your f****** job'.

He was released from jail last May, half way through a seven month sentence for assault, but has since breached his licence conditions.

Over a 24 hour period he continued to mock officers, posting: 'Catching me is like keeping up with Usain Bolt, impossible.'

He added: 'Well what should I do today, hand myself in or enjoy my freedom a little longer.

'Freedom... prison... freedom... prison... freedom or prison? That is the question.'

As friends told him to hand himself in, he wrote: 'I think I might as well live my freedom before it gets taken away.'

One friend joked: 'Ha ha, you can run but you can't hide.

'They found you once and they'll find you again.'

Another friend added: 'Police banging my door yesterday looking for you, I'm not happy about it.'

As well as his mocking posts, Watkins has also posted a picture of himself apparently urinating on a police car.

He hinted that he may even be likely to flee the country, saying: 'I'm off now, adios amigos.'
