A dedicated mother who lost eight stone in just 17 months through diet and exercise claims she has been refused surgery - because she chose not to have a gastric band.

Morbidly obese Sarah Whitaker, 32, of Highworth, Wilts. dropped more than six dress sizes after she was warned by her GP she might not see her three-year-old daughter grow up.

Her hardwork saw her slim down to just 15st 5lb, from a life-threatening 23st 6lb, but as a result she was left with folds of excess skin.

But when she asked her GP for surgery to remove the skin she was told the NHS would refuse because she not been fitted with a gastric band.

Sarah said: 'I decided to start losing weight as I had seen myself in pictures and I wasn't happy.'I was also told by my GP that if I carried on I could get diabetes and heart disease and might not see my daughter growing up.

'That's when I started the fitness camps and, although it was hard, the results kept me going.

'But now I have excess skin around my stomach and it is uncomfortable. It does not look very nice.

'It is getting to the stage it's getting in the way, I would be at least a clothes size smaller if I didn't have it.

'It affects my confidence, I essentially have a skirt of skin, the most weight I lose the more it becomes visible.

'It makes me look bigger than I actually am, at the moment I don't look a true representation of how much weight I've lost and how small I am now.

'I thought as I was doing it by myself they would pay for it. I could have had a gastric band, I met the criteria, but I didn't. I was no cost to them.

'The skin removal surgery costs a lot less than the gastric band, I thought they would love that.'

It is estimated that having a gastric band - a device around the stomach to reduce the amount of food eaten - costs between £8,000 and £14,000.

Aesthetic skin removal surgery costs from £1,500 to £6,000.

Administrator Sarah began her weight loss journey in January 2012.

She undertook 17 months of intensive fitness camp programmes with NKD Fitness, in Swindon, and switched her unhealthy burgers and chips for 'clean, fresh and unprocessed food'.

Sarah soon began dropping the pounds and is well on her way to her target of 11st.

She recently qualified as a fitness instructor, and now undertakes her own one-day fitness camp for NKD.

Joanne Baker, the owner of NKD Fitness Camps in Swindon, said: 'Sarah has worked extremely hard, has become more confident and her personality shines.

'I am disgusted that the NHS would rather obese individuals go through gastric bypass than learn good eating habits and be educated for a lifelong healthy future.'

An NHS Swindon Clinical Commissioning Group spokesman said: 'We are unable to comment on individual cases.

'The removal of excess skin is generally considered to be a cosmetic procedure, which is not routinely funded.

'The Swindon Clinical Commissioning Group policy for this procedure says in exceptional circumstances surgical intervention may be considered for patients who have reduced their weight by 50 per cent.

'This applies to individuals who have lost the weight independently or through procedures such as a gastric band.'
