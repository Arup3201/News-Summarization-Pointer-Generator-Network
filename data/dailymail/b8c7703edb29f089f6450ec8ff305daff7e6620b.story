Now a doting grandfather, Bill Clinton has revealed his four-month-old granddaughter 'the best thing since sliced bread' during an interview with Seth Meyers

'So far my daughter has not had to discipline her overly exuberant grandparents too much,' he joked

'It's so fun,' he said. 'So far my daughter has not had to discipline her overly exuberant grandparents too much,' he joked.

'You know, these young people, they know what the rules are on child rearing. It's very impressive.'

He said that he and Hillary are able to see Charlotte frequently because Chelsea and Marc live in New York City. 

Doting grandparents: Bill and Hillary Clinton had long spoken of their desire to have a grandchild - which came true last year

During the interview Seth Meyers coyly asked him whether he would live in a different house in 2016, to which he laughingly responded: 'I hope not, because 2016 is the election year and I don't have any place to move.'

Since the birth, Charlotte has been growing up in the family's $10million apartment in the nearby Flatiron District. 

The couple bought the home in the beautiful Whitman Building, near Madison Square Park, a year ago - relocating from their last $4million apartment just a block away.

The $5,000-square-foot apartment occupies an entire floor of the building, and comes with four bedrooms, six and a half bathrooms, a home office and den. 

Its interior is lit with natural light, thanks to the floor to ceiling windows that look over the nearby greenspace.

The couple also have their own 252-square-foot terrace to baby-proof. 

In November during an appearance on the Ellen Show Clinton went on to recall the day Chelsea gave birth and riding in the car to the hospital with Hillary to see Charlotte for the first time, and the hilarious conversation they had about their role as grandparents.

'I told Hillary as we were going to the hospital: 'Now, we have to remember that this is not our child and we have to show up when we're invited and do what we're asked'.'' 

Home, sweet home: This $10million apartment in the Flatiron District is where Charlotte has been growing up
