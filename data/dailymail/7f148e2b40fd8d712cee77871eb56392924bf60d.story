President Barack Obama said Wednesday that he would 'work with Congress to ramp up support for those in the Syrian opposition who offer the best alternative to terrorists and a brutal dictator.'

But the central theme of his foreign policy-heavy address was that American strength would continue to come by working through international coalitions.

Obama called for diplomacy and 'multilateral action' in the face of global threats. His prepared remarks, distributed by the White House, replaced that phrase with the words 'collective action.'

Receiving 
tepid applause and a short standing ovation from less than one-quarter 
of the audience upon his introduction, Obama argued for a contradictory 
foreign policy that relies on NATO and the United Nations while 
insisting that 'America must always lead on the world stage.'

'If we don’t, no one else will,' he insisted.

But 'we require partners,' he said, using the words 'partner' or 'partnership' 16 times in his speech.

His 
speech, delivered during the graduation ceremony at the U.S. Military 
Academy at West Point, indicated a softening of the White House's 
reluctance to put American military resources in the hands of Syrians 
fighting against Bashar al-Assad.

'We will 
step up our efforts to support Syria’s neighbors,' he said, making sure that 'those countries, and not just the 
United States, are contributing their fair share of support to the 
Syrian people.'

But
 he also said he would rely on other countries including Jordan, 
Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq to 'confront terrorists working across Syrian 
borders.'

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to West Point that 'we look at the Syria conflict as part of a broader counterterrorism challenge.'

'That is why we're going to continue increasing our support to the moderate opposition, who offer the best alternative to both the murderous Assad dictatorship and the extremists who have exploited the crisis.'

It's not clear what form that support will take, or if the U.S. will offer any of it on its own.

He did say that America 'will use military force, unilaterally if necessary, when our core interests demand it – when our people are threatened; when our livelihood is at stake; or when the security of our allies is in danger.'

But 'when issues of global concern that do not pose a direct threat to the United States are at stake – when crises arise that stir our conscience or push the world in a more dangerous direction – then the threshold for military action must be higher,' he said.

'In such circumstances, we should not go it alone.'

Indeed, Obama's central foreign policy argument on Wednesday was that while he 
'believe[s] in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my being,' 
American leadership in his administration will continue to consist of 
working through international coalitions.

'This is American leadership, American strength,' he said.

House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Ed Royce slammed Obama for bringing about 'a general loss of U.S. credibility, making successful foreign policy nearly impossible'

'Of
 course, skeptics often downplay the effectiveness of multilateral 
action,' he allowed. 'For them, working through international 
institutions, or respecting international law, is a sign of weakness. I 
think they’re wrong.'

He
 told West Point cadets that 'in the course of your service, you will 
work as a team with diplomats and development experts. You will get to 
know allies and train partners.'

'You will embody what it means for America to lead.'

'By most 
measures,' the president said, 'America has rarely been stronger 
relative to the rest of the world. Those who argue otherwise – who 
suggest that America is in decline, or has seen its global leadership 
slip away – are either misreading history or engaged in partisan 
politics.'

Republicans
 in Congress have consistently argued that Obama has weakened the United
 States. Polls in Europe and elsewhere indicate that citizens of foreign
 nations have lowered the opinions of the United States since he took 
office.

Rep. Ed Royce, a California Republican who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement after Obama's speech that the president has made foreign policy 'assurances' since taking office in 2009, '[b]ut too often, strong words have been followed by weak actions, or no actions.'

'The result has been a general loss of U.S. credibility, making successful foreign policy nearly impossible.'

'The Obama Administration has consistently underestimated the threats we face,' he said, citing Iran, North Korea and al-Qaeda.

He drew cheers from graduating cadets – far more robust applause than his speech itself – by announcing a symbolic pardon for those who were 'on restriction due to minor conduct offenses' as students.

As they graduate, cadets are released from those punishments automatically.

The president's biggest applause line was not for a policy position, but in praise of a former West Point cadet who was wounded in Afghanistan.

Gavin White 'lost one of his legs in an attack,' Obama said. 'I met him last year at Walter Reed. He was wounded, but just as determined as the day that he arrived here. He developed a simple goal.

'Today, his sister Morgan will graduate. And true to his promise, Gavin will be there to stand and exchange salutes with her.'
