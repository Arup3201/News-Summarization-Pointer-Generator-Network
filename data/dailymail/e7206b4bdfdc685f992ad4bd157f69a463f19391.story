Two brothers have been jailed on Armistice Day for snatching poppy collection boxes from hotels.

Adam
Tookey, 22, and his older brother Karl, 25, were caught on CCTV 
swiping a red appeal tin from a Holiday Inn in Oldbury, near West Bromwich in the West 
Midlands.

The brothers were
spotted entering the hotel at 12.30pm last Wednesday before they grabbed the charity box from the front desk and fled.

Hours later they stole a second collection tin from the Britannia Hotel in Birmingham city centre.

Today
while millions of people in Britain held a two-minute silence to 
remember those who gave their lives in both World Wars, the pair were 
jailed for 12 months each.

They pleaded guilty to two counts of theft when they appeared at Warley Magistrates' Court.

Sentencing
them, chairman of the bench David Payne, said: 'We have taken time to 
consider this matter and we feel it is so serious the time for custody 
applies.

'It was part of an 
organised group crime. Your previous convictions are awful. These were 
planned offences on a vulnerable charity.'

The brothers were with a third suspect (centre). Following the raid, Amy Sanders, 22, of Birmingham, was arrested and has pleaded not guilty to theft

Mike O'Mahoney, defending, said: 'I spoke to them at length and they are ashamed of what they have done.

'I
think they quickly realised this was out of the ordinary when they were
in detention. I think they were embarrassed and they wish to apologise 
through me.

'Mean spirited,
despicable - whatever words you want to describe it they have used over
the past two days. They are so embarrassed they havenâ€™t even told their
families.'

The brothers, of Birmingham, were caught after police appealed for information on social media.

Another woman, Amy Sanders, 22, also of Birmingham, pleaded not guilty to theft.

She was bailed and ordered to return to Wolverhampton Crown Court on February 11 next year.

Last week a man in Bolton pleaded guilty to outraging public decency for urinating on a box of paper poppies.

A judge branded his actions 'despicable' and the case sparked public outrage.

In a bid to apologise for his actions, 24-year-old Daniel Orrell has spent the time since fundraising for the Royal British Legion.
