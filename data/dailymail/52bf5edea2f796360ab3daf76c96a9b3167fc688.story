Kim, who has three other children, thought the process had been smooth until she began to realize Rylan was not developing normally, reports the Huffington Post.

When he turned three, he stabbed knives inside a watermelon and became more and more violent.

She says her son has an imaginary robot friend called Bleeder - and he says the character tells him to kill his entire family with knives.

Kim said: 'He talks about how he is going to lift them [knives] up over his head and plunge them  into our chest.'

She added: 'When Rylan was six he locked himself in the bathroom, he found his older brother's razor and he cut off the tips of his fingers because he wanted to see them bleed. 

'In Rylan's head, Bleeder was the one who told him to cut his fingers so he could see the blood and feel the pain.

Rylan's Dad, Ryan said: 'When he loses all control, our last resort is a therapeutic hold. We've had to hold him for upwards of 45 minutes to an hour'

The pair say they are both now terrified of their son who they both take turns caring for. 

'He talks about stabbing us, about how he's going to lift them up over his head and plunge them into our chests so he that he gets the best impact,' said Kim.

'My biggest fear is that we're raising a school shooter, a mass murderer, a serial killer.' 

They have put him in seven different hospitals for treatment, but to no avail. 

Rylan's father, Ryan said: 'We have not lived a normal day in probably the last three years.'

'When he loses all control, our last resort is a therapeutic hold. 

'We've had to hold him for upwards of 45 minutes to an hour.' 

His said along with his son's violent behavior, he is also always cursing at them. 

The pair use a therapeutic hold as a last resort when Rylan's behavior is uncontrollable.

'We've had to hold him for upwards of 45 minutes to an hour,' said Ryan.

'I don't enjoy doing that to my son, it's a necessary evil. 

'Rylan decided one day to flood my toilet. 

'When I pulled the toilet away from the wall, I found two shave razors, a fork, and an ink pen - he was hiding sharp objects,' Ryan said.

'I do worry about Rylan killing someone.'
