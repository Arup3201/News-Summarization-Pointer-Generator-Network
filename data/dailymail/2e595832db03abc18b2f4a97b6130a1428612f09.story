A super-rich multi-millionaire will get to enjoy this incredible five-floor penthouse with a giant infinity pool and its own slide when it goes on sale next year.

The luxury flat at the top of a new skyscraper in Monaco that overlooks the Mediterranean will set its owner back around £240 million.

The multi-storey penthouse is located in
 Tour Odéon, a 560ft tower which will be the Mediterranean coastline's 
second tallest building when it is completed next year.

Groundbreaking: The 49-storey skyscraper will be the second tallest building on the Mediterranean coast

As well as being equipped with a health centre, multiple swimming pools and an in-house caterer, the building will offer its residents a 24/7 concierge service and a private chauffeur.

But the penthouse is set to stand out even in the midst of such extreme luxury, with its slide which descends from the balcony into the infinity pool making it a veritable millionaire's playground.

Tour Odéon, with its 70 super-sized flats, is the first new skyscraper to have been built in Monaco since the 1980s.

Prince
 Rainier, who was then the country's ruler, decided to half the 
construction of tall buildings on the shoreline over worries they were 
destroying the principality's character.

Pricey: The flats in the building are aimed at the European super-rich who are unaffected by the recession

Modern: Residents of the building have access to a catering service, 24/7 concierge and private caterer

But in 2009 his son and successor Albert reversed that decision and greenlit the Tour Odéon project.

While its construction has not been 
halted by the global recession, Europe's economic troubles do seem to 
have affected the take-up of flats in the building, with just 18 having 
been sold so far.

And 
the tower has also been controversial among residents of Beausoleil, a 
neighbouring town on the other side of the border with France, who 
complain that it has ruined their views.

James
 Price from Knight Frank, which is handling the sale of flats in Tour 
Odéon, said: 'These duplexes and the penthouse are set to catch the eye 
of those looking for the very best properties across the world's leading
 markets.'

Glitzy: The tower is the first skyscraper to be built in Monaco since the 1980s

Good night's sleep: But residents of a neighbouring town have complained about the new project

Attractive: The building is expected to be one of the most sought-after addresses on the Mediterranean

Exclusive: Monaco has a long-running reputation as an enclave popular with the very wealthy
