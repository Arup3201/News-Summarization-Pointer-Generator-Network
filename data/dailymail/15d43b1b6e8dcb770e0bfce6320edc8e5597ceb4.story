Shake up: Theresa May is particularly worried that there are major variations between forces in the number of searches that end in arrests

Police are wasting hundreds of thousands of hours stopping and searching people who have done nothing wrong, Theresa May will warn today.

In a statement to MPs, the Home Secretary will promise to restrict the use of controversial ‘sus’ laws.

Mrs May fears that, as well as devouring huge amounts of police time, overuse of the powers is harming community relations, with young black men seven times more likely to be targeted than whites.

Last year police conducted 1.2million
 stops and searches but only 9 per cent – 107,000 – ended in arrest, 
leaving more than a million ‘pointless’ sus checks.

In
 some parts of the country, the figure is as low as 3 per cent, raising 
huge question marks over whether the power is being used properly.

Mrs May will tell MPs that conducting a search, then filling in the paperwork afterwards, takes an average of 16 minutes.

Last year 312,000 hours were consumed in this way – the equivalent of 145 full-time officers doing nothing else.

The number of hours spent on stops and searches that did not end in arrest was almost 300,000.

Mrs May says that, in many cases, this represents a ‘dreadful waste of time’.

The
 Home Secretary will stress that the Government has no intention of 
scrapping the power altogether because it is a vital tool in the fight 
against crime.

In London, it led to the arrest of 45,000 suspected criminals last year, many of them carrying drugs, guns and other weapons.

Crackdown: Theresa May will tell MPs that the use of controversial 'sus' laws must be restricted to improve the use of police time and community relations

But she is launching a two-month consultation on how to restrict its use in future.

Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, which has been reviewing stop and search, is to help formulate a new regime.

Proposals will then be published later this year for a major shake-up of the law. Mrs May is particularly worried that there are major variations between forces.

In Cumbria, only three in every 100 stops ends in an arrest. This compares to 19 per cent in Kent, 17 per cent in Northumbria and 16 per cent in Cleveland and Sussex.

Officials believe it is possible to slash the number of searches and still continue to cut crime and protect the public.

In London, the Met has improved training and set a target of at least one in every five searches ending in an arrest or drugs warning.

This figure has almost been achieved. In
 the borough of Hackney, the ratio was more than 26 per cent. The number
 of searches in the capital is down from 500,000 to 350,000.

Selective: Young black men are seven times more likely to be stopped and searched by police officers than white people

There is significant concern in Whitehall that the power is being used too liberally, damaging community relations.

A Home Office source said: ‘Stop and search is a really important power for the police in the fight against gangs, knife crime and drug offences.

‘But with only 9 per cent of the more than one million stop and search incidents leading to an arrest, and black and ethnic minority people up to seven times more likely to be searched than white people, we must face up to concerns about its use.

‘It needs to be used fairly, in a way that builds community confidence in the police rather than undermining it.

'And if it is being used too much or with the wrong people, then that is a dreadful waste of police time.’
