Dave Whelan has undermined his chances of escaping censure from the Football Association after managing to cause further offence to the Chinese community in what appeared to be an attempt to apologise to the Jewish community.

The Wigan chairman is already under investigation from the FA after an attempt to justify the appointment of Malky Mackay as his new manager – at a time when he too is under investigation by the FA for a series of racist, sexist and homophobic messages – by allegedly insulting both Jewish and Chinese people. In one interview last month he reportedly claimed that Jews ‘chase money’ while trying to defend Mackay’s use of the word ‘chink’.

This time 78-year-old Whelan has referred to Chinese people as ‘chingalings’ in what is supposed to be an apology to the Jewish community via an interview with the Jewish Telegraph. The FA are aware of the remarks and are also looking into them.

‘When I was growing up we used to call the Chinese “chingalings”,’ he told the newspaper. ‘We weren’t being disrespected (sic). We used to say, "We’re going to eat in chingalings".'

‘The Chinese weren’t offended by that. That was the name everyone in Wigan called it [the first Chinese cafe in Wigan].’

Only on Thursday Whelan requested a further week to respond to an FA charge for his original comments. Whelan, who has said he will resign as Wigan chairman if he is found guilty of a breach of FA regulations, has to either accept the charge or contest it in the disciplinary hearing that will then follow.

On the subject of his allegedly stereotypical statements about Jews, he told the Jewish Telegraph: ‘I apologise profusely to anyone who has taken offence because I would never offend the Jewish community under any circumstances.

The Wigan chairman has until 6pm on Friday, December 12 to respond to his misconduct charge

‘I have nothing but respect for them. They’re hard-working people, they’re honest people. They fight for what they believe in.

‘There’s nobody could knock the Jewish community. For them to accuse me of that, it hurts me a lot.

‘Never have I made anti-Jewish comments.

‘We have always, always respected what the Jewish people did, especially through the war.

‘We’ve always respected how those Jewish [people] stood up to every single thing they were put through, torture, horrendous.

‘And I have nothing but the highest regard and respect for the Jewish people.’

Whelan gave the interview, it is claimed, after a Manchester Jewish charity called off a fundraising breakfast he had been due to address later this month after donors threatened to withdraw support if the event went ahead.

‘Please take it I have a lot of Jewish friends,’ he said.

‘I bet there are a dozen who have got apartments in Majorca, where I am.

‘And so many Jewish people go to Barbados at Christmas. That’s when I go. I see a lot of them in the Lone Star, in restaurants. I play golf with a few of them.

‘I don’t want to mention any particular names because I don’t want to pull their names into it.’

Whelan, who made his fortune through his sports stores, also told the newspaper ‘two Jewish boys’ had taught him the market trading business.
