A daredevil tour guide who hand-feeds giant crocodiles to impress visitors is passing on his death-defying skills to his 13-year-old daughter.

Jason Vargas Aguero, 36, has run the Crocodile Man Tour along the Tarcoles River in Costa Rica for the past 15 years, wowing tourists by dropping food into the predator's gaping jaws.

Now his teenage daughter Jimena Vargas wants to follow in her father's footstepsÂ  - even though the job nearly cost him his life when one of the reptiles bit his arm and dragged him into the river.

Feeding time: Mr Aguero has run the Crocodile Man Tour for the past 15 years, wowing tourists by dropping food into the predator's gaping jaws

Like father like daughter: Mr Aguero's daughter Jimena Vargas shares her father's passion for crocodiles

'I am only giving her some advice so that if one day she wants to do it, she will know how,' he said.

'I've explained a lot to her and told her she has to know their behaviour, to respect them and to be very, very careful.

'But I hope she doesn't follow in my footsteps. I don't want her to risk her life like her dad has for many years.'

Mr Aguero and his family run trips along a 4km stretch of river in Costa Rica where thousands of American crocodiles live and breed.

Dangerous: The job nearly cost Mr Aguero his life when one of the more aggressive male reptiles bit his arm and dragged him into the river

Huge: The creatures are among the biggest reptiles in the world, reaching lengths of 17ft long and weighing just under 2000lb

The creatures are among the biggest reptiles in the world, reaching lengths of 17ft long and weighing just under 2000lb.

But Mr Aguero - who says the job requires 'bravery, help from God and a little craziness' - said he never wanted to do anything else.

'I do it because it gives me a thrill, lots of adrenaline,' he said.

Future plans: Schoolgirl Jinema is adamant she will work on the river with her father

Brave: Jimena says she is scared of the crocodiles, but finds her father's job 'nice and interesting'

'I grew up in Tarcoles, close to the river, and so all my life I've seen them and shared with them.'

He added: 'The first time feeding them was terrifying, I'm not going to lie.

'The adrenaline rush was massive and it took me a year to get used to them and to trust them a little bit more.'

Over the years, Mr Aguero has come to know the crocodiles very well and has given them names based on their characteristics.

Family bond: Mr Aguero and Jimena take to the river together

Pride: Mr Aguero says Jimena is proud to tell her friends that he is the Crocodile Man

One female with a larger rear has been named Jennifer Lopez while some of the more aggressive males are named after American presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton.

'Believe it or not, every crocodile has its own personality,' he added.

'Some are more aggressive then others.

'But to me the more aggressive they are the better, as it makes a better show.'

However, it was one of these larger, more aggressive males that almost killed him in an accident five years ago.

Instead of taking the raw chicken he was dangling above its mouth the crocodile leapt forward and clamped its jaws onto his arm.

'He dragged me into the water and I had to fight him,' said Mr Aguero, who spent months in hospital recovering.

'After five minutes I found a branch on which I could sit. I put my finger in his eye and he let go.

'That time it worked but let's hope I won't have to do it again. I don't want to have to go back into the water with my hand inside its mouth and 68 teeth and 2000lb of pressure on my arm.'

Up close: To attract the crocodiles, Mr Aguero slaps the water with hunks of chicken to create noise and vibrations before he feeds them

Mr Aguero tries to steer clear of crocodiles when they are protecting their babies or very hungry as they are more dangerous.

To attract them he slaps the water with hunks of chicken to create noise and vibrations.

He then leaves the boat to feed them from the muddy bank, sometimes sinking up to his knees in the soft sediment - which makes him extra vulnerable.

'You have to be very, very careful,' added Mr Aguero, whose older brother Diego is the general manager of the company.

No fear: Mr Aguero says that the crocodiles can smell adrenaline if people are scared of them

'When you look at the crocodiles it's like a cat, like a tiger. They can smell adrenaline if you're scared.'

Despite the dangers of her father's job, Jimena shares his interest in the reptiles.

'Crocodiles fascinate my daughter, she is crazy about them,' said Mr Aguero.

'Always when they mention it at school she tells her friends "my dad is the Crocodile Man". She is always talking about my work and she's very proud of me.'

Mr Aguero and his family believe she will eventually grow out of her obsession and develop other ambitions.

But for now the schoolgirl is adamant she will work on the river with him.

She said: 'Crocodiles interest me a lot. My dad doesn't like it, he would prefer it if I looked for my own career.

'But to me, giving food to an animal is something very nice and interesting. It's like helping them to eat.'

Second nature: Mr Aguero grew up close to the river and has become used to sharing the space with the crocodiles who live there

Documentary: Mr Aguero's story will feature in new Animal Planet series Preposterous Pets

She added: 'I have seen when my dad gives them food and heard how it sounds when it shuts its mouth.

'I sometimes imagine if it doesn't take it, it will then eat the person. It just will pull you in and swallow you. That makes me very scared.

'But not just anybody can do this job; you have to be very brave.'

Mr Aguero's story is one of several to appear in new Animal Planet series' Preposterous Pets, which starts on Thursday, April 3 at 8pm.
