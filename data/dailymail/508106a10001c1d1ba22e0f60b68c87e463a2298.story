A city council has sent thousands of leaflets to homes telling people how to put out their bins, it was revealed today.

The 5,000 leaflets distributed by Coventry City Council use images with green ticks and red crosses to describe the correct angle for wheelie bins to be placed before they are collected by binmen.

The flyers, which have been sent out in the Hillfields and Foleshill areas, were distributed following health and safety fears that workers could be injured if they handled bins left facing the wrong way.

The initiative - which has been branded ‘condescending’ by critics who said ‘how to put out a bin is hardly rocket science’ - cost £227 in printing costs, plus the money spent on design and delivery.

Andrew Walster, from the city services department, said: ‘It’s not about saving time. The bigger issue we have is that we are going back to the days of black bin bags and manual handling issues.

‘If we have 200 bins the wrong way around on a street we reintroduce the manual handling aspect of bin collection and we could have lots of people with musculoskeletal problems.’

He told the Coventry Telegraph the picture design was chosen to avoid problems with language in the areas targeted by the council in the trial - and there was no intention to patronise people.

But campaign group the TaxPayers’ Alliance was left fuming at what it called a ‘pointless exercise’.

Political director Jonathan Isaby said: 'Coventry Council ought to be focusing on providing a decent bin service rather than spending valuable time and money sending out this condescending leaflet.

'Keeping residents informed is important, but how to put out a bin is hardly rocket science. When money is tight for families and local authorities alike, the council should not be wasting money on this sort of pointless exercise.'

City resident Dave Evans, who saw the leaflets, told the Coventry Telegraph: ‘If this is a health and safety issue why has it only been raised now and, if so, is it not a health and safety issue to residents?

‘Binmen have taken laziness to a whole new level. Why are the council allowing this to happen? Shall I get Tuesdays off work and load my own bins?’
