Manchester City defender Matija Nastasic is poised to wrap up his move to Schalke over the coming days.

Sportsmail revealed Schalke's interest last month and that of AC Milan. The Italians have failed to follow up with any substantial bid as they push their finances towards other priorities and Schalke are hopeful of concluding an initial loan with a view to a permanent £10million signing.

Nastasic, 21, has 16 caps for Serbia and was considered to have a promising future when he arrived from Fiorentina for £12m. However, he has failed to establish himself and the arrival of Eliaquim Mangala has limited his prospects further.

Arsenal and Inter Milan showed interest initially but Schalke coach Roberto Di Matteo has pressed for Nastasic and the German side will conclude a deal shortly.

City are continuing to look for a left-sided defender but that is more likely to be for the summer.

Chelsea starlet Lewis Baker has joined Sheffield Wednesday on loan after they won a three-way tussle for his signature with Bolton Wanderers and Nottingham Forest.

The England Under 20 international is one of Chelsea's brightest prospects and the three Championship sides were eager to add him to their squads to improve their chances of promotion.

Jose Mourinho said that he would have failed as a coach if Baker, 19, did not become an England international under his management. The stylish midfielder has been a key member of Chelsea's U21 side, where he acts as a midfield general cajoling and pushing his side forward with simple, effective passing and good movement. He made his senior debut a year ago against Derby County in the FA Cup as a late substitute.

Meanwhile, Barnsley are discussing a deal for former Chelsea forward Milan Lalkovic. The 22-year-old Slovakia U21 international was born in Kosice but was signed by Chelsea at 16. He never made an appearance but had various loan spells before moving to Czech side Mlada Boleslav and Danny Wilson is keen to bring him back to England.

Inter Milan are continuing to press for Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva.

The Brazilian is on around £85,000 a week and has a lengthy contract.

Inter, who are ready to offload troublesome striker Dani Osvaldo, are close to signing Xherdan Shaqiri from Bayern Munich but want a reliable midfielder like Lucas to protect their defence.

Liverpool have been linked with a move for Roma's Miralem Pjanic but initial signs are the midfielder is not keen on a move to Anfield.

Arsenal have gone cool on a deal for St Etienne's Loic Perrin after his club asked for £8m for the 29-year-old defender. Villarreal's versatile defender Gabriel Paulista has since been put forward to Arsene Wenger and is a player all the scouting staff like but a work permit would seem improbable.

The 24-year-old Brazilian has not been capped by his country and reportedly has no dual passport. He is expected to join Brazil's future squads but that will struggle to get him past an appeal. His team-mate Bruno Soriano has also been discussed.

Arsenal have been told any deal for West Ham United's Winston Reid would cost them £7m in a transfer fee and they are weighing up their options.

Eccentric Sampdoria owner Massimo Ferrero wants Samuel Eto'o from Everton.

Ferrero, a film producer, has cut a controversial and sometimes comical figure in the Italian media with outspoken comments and marketing ideas.

He has attempted to engineer a return to Italy for Mario Balotelli with his out-of-contract goalkeeper Sergio Romero going the other way and is now looking at Everton striker Eto'o.

After the recent match against Lazio, representatives from the club met with the player's agent, Claudio Vigorelli.

The Everton striker, who also has tentative interest from Valencia, is understood to be willing to listen to their offer as he considers whether to remain at Goodison Park for another season.

The big obstacle for Sampdoria is his wages with 33-year-old Eto'o reputed to be earning £2.35m a season.

Blackburn Rovers are looking for around £6m for striker Rudy Gestede as West Browmich Albion show interest.

The 6ft 4ins striker has scored 12 goals in 23 games this season which prompted Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp and Kevin Bond to check on him when Blackburn played at Brentford last month. He scored again but QPR decided, with their transfer budget, that Gestede was not for them. Tony Pulis, however, believes he may be a player worth taking a chance on.

Gestede's team-mate Jordan Rhodes continues to draw scouts to Ewood Park also but the likes of Southampton have yet to follow up with a bid.

Albion, meanwhile, have also checked on Sheffield Wednesday's French defender Claude Dielna, 27, who can play centre back and le t-back. He scored his only goal in the 2-1 win over Blackburn last month.

Tottenham Hotspur are willing to make an offer for Burnley striker Danny Ings in this window but Sean Dyche is hopeful the England U21 international will still see out his contract.

Leicester City have already bid £8m for the 22-year-old but the prospect of moving to Tottenham now is more tantalising. Burnley would still make £3m in compensation should Ings leave at the end of his deal in the summer but the player is having to consider whether Tottenham will move on to other targets by that stage.

Tottenham expect to lose Kyle Naughton to Swansea City and are waiting for West Brom and others to place serious bids for Aaron Lennon. Albion and Southampton also have an interest in Ings.

Burnley will announce the permanent signing of Michael Keane from Manchester United over the next 24 hours.

Tottenham's former striker Jermaine Defoe is training with the club's development squad for the next week 'to maintain fitness during MLS close season'.

Leicester and Wolverhampton Wanderers are keeping a check on Basford United winger Blair Anderson. The Midland FL Premier Division club are managed by former Stoke City striker Martin Carruthers and Anderson has ex-Aston Villa midfielder Lee Hendrie playing alongside him.

Scouts from League One clubs have also been following his progress this season and believe Anderson can make the step up into league football.

Rotherham have completed the signing of Leicester's Jack Barmby, 20, on loan for the rest of the season.

Red Star Belgrade are close to signing former QPR winger Josh Parker. The 24-year-old has had a colourful career. He was born in Slough but has been capped by Antigua and Barbuda and has been playing for Domzale in Slovenia where his return of 14 goals in 42 games caught the attention of scouts and Red Star, now known as Crvena Zvezda, have offered him a contract.

Millwall are in discussions to sign Wales and Charlton striker Simon Church on loan.

Portsmouth and Mansfield Town are interested in taking Oxford United midfielder Alfie Potter on a permanent deal. The 25-year-old has made over 130 appearances for Oxford since joining from Peterborough. He has scored three goals this season.

Newport striker Christian Jolley is attracting interest from Dover Athletic and Eastleigh. The 26-year-old former Wimbledon player had a recent spell on loan at Forest Green.
