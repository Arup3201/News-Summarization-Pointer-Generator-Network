Thankfully the umpire did not have to ask for 'new balls, please' after this uncomfortable incident at the Australian Open on Thursday in Melbourne. 

Instead of a line judge calling 'out!', it was a case of shouting 'ouch!' after a ferocious serve from Spain's Feliciano Lopez hit a stunned ball boy right where it hurts.

The unfortunate ball boy got in the way of Lopez's 200km/h serve during the first set of his match with Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, and had no chance of getting out of the way before it thumped into the tenderest of regions.

Grimacing in pain the stunned ball boy spun around after being hit and briefly tried to walk it off.

But he soon got down on one knee to get his breath back as a worried Lopez then walked down the court to make sure he was all right.

The umpire and players stood around the teenager giving words of encouragement, but they could do little to ease his pain.

Minutes later he was forced from the court as an anxious Lopez walked along with him.

Ironically it wasn't the only retirement of the match as Lopez moved into the third round after Mannarino called it quits in the fourth set, despite leading two sets to one.

At least in the poor ball boy's case he probably had a much stronger reason not to play on.

In the end the ball boy is accompanied from the court by the the umpire and Lopez
