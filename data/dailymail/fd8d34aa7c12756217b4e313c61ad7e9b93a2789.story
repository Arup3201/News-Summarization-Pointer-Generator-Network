Celtic are weighing up a move for £1.5million-rated Gambian strike prospect Modou Barrow.

A 21-year-old striker with Ostersunds FK in Sweden, Barrow was the subject of a rejected £600,000 bid from Bolton Wanderers after spending last week on trial with the English Championship club.

And Ostersunds president Daniel Kindberg claimed the Scottish champions are also interested in the pacy forward, following a glowing recommendation from former Hamilton boss Billy Reid — now the Swedish club’s assistant manager.

Hot property: Modou Barrow has the quality to reach the top according to the assistant manager at Osterlunds

Keen to conclude a deal in the next fortnight, Kindberg claims Hull City, QPR and Everton will watch Barrow against Sundsvall tomorrow night after Bolton’s opening offer was kicked out.

‘We have rejected a £600,000 bid,’ Kindberg told Sportsmail. ‘We put Modou in the price range of £1.5m but it depends on the structure and sell-on clause. We also want to look after the player.

‘He has just arrived back from Bolton because we have an important game on Friday when we start the autumn part of the season.

‘We had a very encouraging report from (Bolton boss) Dougie Freedman about the player. We also have interest from Celtic, Middlesbrough and Swansea.

‘We have an English manager in Graham Potter and a Scots assistant in Billy Reid, who has been speaking to people at Celtic about the player.

In the know: Celtic manager Ronny Deila should have a good knowledge of the Scandinavian game

‘Celtic’s youth coach David Moss has been here with his team and Celtic have an exceptional scouting record. They know the Scandinavian market well. We are taking their interest very seriously.

‘Billy is an expert in getting talented players to the top level from his years in Scotland and has done a great job with Modou. We think he will take some big steps in the game.’

Reid, who oversaw the development of the likes of James McCarthy and James McArthur at Hamilton, was full of praise for the striker, saying: ‘Modou is sensationally quick and technically good. If anyone was going to be worth big money in the future, it is this guy. He’s got great potential.’

A prolific scorer as a teenager in the Swedish lower leagues, Barrow quit IFK Norrkoping for personal reasons, but scored six goals in nine games in the first half of the Swedish season, attracting interest from British clubs.
