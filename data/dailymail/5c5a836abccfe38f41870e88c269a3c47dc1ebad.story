A war hero praised for his bravery in Iraq died after being buried under an avalanche while on a skiing training exercise.

Senior Aircraftman Paul Mahoney, 26, who had been one of the last British servicemen to leave Iraq, was taking part in a training trip in the German Alps in preparation for deployment in Afghanistan with 15 Squadron of the RAF Regiment.

The exercise, named 'Snow Eagle' was designed to expose servicemen to hostile terrains and during one descent, SAC Mahoney and two of his comrades were engulfed by a snow slide. While the other two were rescued, SAC Mahoney was buried and, by the time he was dragged clear nine minutes later, was dead.

After the incident, on February 4, 2010, a major investigation was launched and the leader of the expedition, Flight Sgt Stephen Henderson, was charged with manslaugher - although later cleared at a court martial.

It was alleged Flt Sgt Henderson failed to comply with safety regulations and ignored avalanche warnings when he led the 23 serviceman down a slope.

However, an inquest into SAC Mahoney's death, held at Warrington Coroners' Court yesterday, recorded a verdict of accidental death.

On the morning of the tragedy, the inquest heard Flt Sgt Henderson, who was leading the trip along with four other qualified instructors, was warned about poor weather conditions and that a level three avalanche warning - out of a possible five levels - had been issued for the area.

However, he evaluated the slopes and decided the expedition should go ahead.

The group left the Grasgehren ski resort in Bavaria, Germany, with the plan of climbing the Reidberger Horn mountain and then skiing down to a hut where they would spend the night.

SAC Mahoney had been in the RAF for two years at the time of his death

It was on the descent that the group heard a 'woomph' sound, indicating that a weak layer of snow had collapsed beneath the surface.

However, while Flt Sgt Henderson sent some students back to the ridge, he concluded the snowpack was stable and the group could continue.

Two instructors stayed at the top and the students descended at 20 metre intervals with everyone intending to meet at the bottom.

The avalanche struck while the group was halfway down the slope. The inquest heard that the slide was caused by sun and wind conditions, although the earlier court martial was told that it could have been triggered by the serviceman skiing over the unstable service in too large groups.

Many
 of the 23 servicemen were either at the bottom or within their final
 stages of descent when the 400 metres wide and 200 metres long 
avalanche hit.

Along with SAC Mahoney, SAC Shepherd and Cpl Murray were also caught up in the collapse.

SAC
 Shepherd was only buried up to his waist and managed for free himself and while Cpl Murray was completely covered apart from his hand, he was quickly pulled free.

SAC Mahoney was 'completely buried' and it took nine minutes later to find him, by which point he was not breathing.

His comrades tried to revive him and rescue helicopters were sent to the scene but SAC Mahoney was declared dead on the mountainside.

SAC Mahoney was only 26 when he died in 2010, shortly before he was due to be deployed in Afghanistan

During Flt Sgt Henderson’s court martial his legal team said that 'backcountry skiing' involved an element of risk-taking and that the he had viewed the slope as shallow and not avalanche prone.

Chris
 Hill, defence counsel, said: 'This is adventurous training and not a 
leisure facility. The purpose was to make a journey and hopefully get to
 the next hut,' he said, adding that 'rules are not to be adhered to 
slavishly.'

At
 the end of the four-week court martial in July 2012, the six-member 
board acquitted Flt Sgt Henderson.

Two other servicemen were caught in the avalanche, but were pulled out in time. It was nine minutes before SAC Mahoney was dragged clear of the snow, by which point he had died

SAC Mahoney had driven armoured vehicles in Basra and was one of the last British servicemen to leave Iraq

At the time of his death, SAC Mahoney - who had joined the armed forces in 2008 - was praised as a 'brave and determined' gunner who had been one of the last British servicemen to leave Iraq. He had been driving Bulldog armoured vehicles on patrols in Basra.

The RAF Regiment is the ground fighting force of the RAF, providing security for bases and carrying out patrol functions.

In a statement released by his family at the time of his death they said: 'We wish to convey how proud we were of him and we knew how proud he was about being in the RAF Regiment. He was "one of the lads" who was always there for his mates.'

Paying tribute to SAC Mahoney the RAF said: 'He kept us safe as he steered his armoured vehicle through the outskirts of Basrah.

'He lived life to the full and has been taken from us unexpectedly and far too early.

'Our thoughts are with his family and close friends at this difficult time.

'He will not be forgotten and his memory will live on in the hearts and minds of 15 Squadron RAF Regiment.'

A full 
service inquiry was also carried out in the aftermath of SAC Mahoney’s 
death by the Ministry of Defence which has since made eight 
recommendations in relation to the Snow Eagle exercise and seven 
recommendations in relation to the wider conduct of service training.

The inquest was told that 11 of the recommendations had been fully implemented and a further four were underway.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman told MailOnline: 'Our thoughts remain with SAC Mahoney’s family and friends at this difficult time.

'A full Service Inquiry has been conducted, and all the recommendations from this have been or are in the process of being implemented, so that we can prevent something like this from ever happening again.'
