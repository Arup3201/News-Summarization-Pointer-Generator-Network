Francis Coquelin has emerged as one of Arsenal's standout performers this season, since returning from a loan-spell at Championship side Charlton Athletic in December.

The 23-year-old Frenchman had been on the peripheries for some time and was loaned to the Addicks in order to gain first-team football; but following injuries to the likes of Jack Wilshere and Mikel Arteta, he was recalled to north London after just five games. 

Now, granted the chance to fill Arsenal's void between defence and midfield, Coquelin has not looked back and is thriving in his role as the Gunners' enforcer.

He told the club's official website, 'I never got the chance to have the run of games before. The manager gave it to me and I can show for the first time what I'm capable of. 

'It's not to be big-headed, but I've always had confidence in myself.' 

Arsenal's next game is against Manchester United in the FA Cup quarter-final at Old Trafford on Monday. The Gunners lifted the trophy last year after defeating Hull City in the final, but know they will have to be at their best to repeat the feat this term.  

And Coquelin insists that Arsenal have plenty left to play for this season, challenging for the Cup, while also attempting to finish in the Premier League's top four and overturning a 3-1 defect in Europe against Monaco.   

He said, 'We've got a lot to fight for. We've got a big game in the Champions League and we need to try and turn that one around. Everything is possible in football.'
