A pet owner who reduced his dog to a bag of bones by depriving her of medication was today spared jail.

Alexander McWilliams, 38, shocked RSPCA inspectors when he brought three-year-old Cleo, a legally registered pitbull terrier, to the door when they attended his flat in Kentish Town, north London in March.

She was found to be suffering from a heart condition that caused her to be emaciated to the point where her spine and ribs were protruding. Vets were later forced to put her down.

Bag of bones: Cleo was bloated, emaciated, with grossly overgrown claws and suffering from a serious heart condition when RSPCA inspectors rescued her in March. She weighed just 18.55kg

McWilliams was found guilty in his absence in July of two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a 
protected animal by failing to provide adequate veterinary care and attention for its heart and skin condition.

The RSPCA was called to his address in March after concerns were raised about a 'very thin dog'.

RSPCA inspector Nicole Broster said: 'She was one of the thinnest living dogs I have ever seen.

'I was horrified to see how thin and weak she was - I did not think it was possible that any living animal could be so underweight - she was merely skin and bone.

'We took her straight to the vets who tried everything they could to save her but after a few days said there was nothing they could do to ease her suffering and the kindest thing to do was put her to sleep to prevent further suffering.

'They confirmed she had been suffering from emaciation and chronic heart failure, with associated pulmonary disease. She also had painful overgrown nails and a chronic skin disease.

'It was so desperately sad to see how much pain she was in.'

Emaciated: Three-year-old Cleo, a pit bull terrier, was found by RSPCA inspectors at the first-floor flat of Alexander McWilliams in Kentish Town, north London. Two dogs are still in McWilliams' care

Prosecutor
 Wendy Gutteridge, for the RSPCA, said: ‘On the 4 March, RSPCA 
inspectors attended the defendant’s home which is a first floor flat.

‘Mr
 McWilliams was outside exercising two dogs on the grounds outside the 
block. He said he had further dogs inside - both registered pitbulls - one dog the inspectors had 
no welfare concerns.

‘The other is the subject of these proceedings, a three-year-old called Cleo.

Cleo
 was bloated, emaciated, with grossly overgrown claws and suffering from
 a serious heart condition, Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court heard. 
She weighed just 18.55kg when she was rescued from the flat.

Ms Gutteridge said: ‘There is nothing to indicate the poor condition Cleo was in was anything other than the result of her untreated heart condition.'

Rescued: The RSPCA said that there is no evidence that indicates the poor condition Cleo was found in by investigators was anything other than the result of her untreated heart condition

Records 
from veterinary charity PDSA show McWilliams last took Cleo to the vets 
three and a half months before the inspectors found her.

Defence lawyer Margaret Anecha said 
McWilliams plans to appeal the court’s guilty finding on two counts of 
causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.

She said: ‘The dog was registered with a vet, and he made every effort to try to ensure the dog did receive treatment.'

Two dogs are still in McWilliams care. He was handed a 18-week sentence suspended for 12 months and ordered to pay £250 costs, an £80 victim surcharge and must abide by a four-month curfew between 8pm and 7am.

McWilliams was further disqualified from owning, keeping or participating from keeping animals for three years, suspended pending his appeal.
