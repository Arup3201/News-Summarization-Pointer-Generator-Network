Negligence: Malbert Rich, 53, is suing Metro for negligence due to its handling of the Jan. 12 incident that left one dead, two critical, and more than 80 sick

A victim of Monday's Washington D.C. Metro smoke incident has revealed how he sent final text messages to his loved ones, convinced he was going to die.

Malbert Rich, 53, is suing the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority for negligence due to its handling of the Monday's incident that left one dead, two critical, and more than 80 sick after inhaling heavy smoke for nearly an hour in a subway train.

With passengers around him coughing, choking, and others vomiting, he said in a news conference, Rich didn't see a way out, WUSA reports. 

Convinced he was going to die, Rich sent a final text message to his children and his mother.

'I told my mother I loved being her son, and I told my kids I loved being their dad,' Rich said.

Rich spent nearly four days in the hospital being treated for smoke inhalation and now his lawsuit is one of two being filed against Metro, according to WUSA.

Rich's lawyer, Kim Brooks Rodney, said that though it is known that the incident was caused by an electrical malfunction in the tunnel, the lawsuit is being filed because of rescuer's delayed response in the situation.

She told WUSA that the goal of the lawsuit is to improve D.C.'s subway system. 

The subway train, consisting of six passenger cars, left the L'Efant Plaza station at 3.15pm and stopped after traveling just 386 feet and began filling with smoke, according to a preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board.  

The passengers were trapped on the train, CBS reports, for 44 minutes before officials cut off the faulty third rail that caused the smoke.

Final Message: Convinced he was going to die, Rich sent a final text message to his children and his mother (here, Rich's lawyer Kim Brooks Rodney, speaks, as Rich looks on)

Passengers on another train that left the station shortly after the first experienced the heavy smoke as well, FOX reports. The first train's driver instructed the passengers to remain calm as he said he would back up the train, returning it to the station. 

However, the second train was blocking the way. The driver of the second train, along with some of its passengers, left the vehicle to get away from the smoke. 

No Way Out: Rich (left) said that people on the train were having seizures around him and he didn't see a way out of the situation (on the right, passengers on the smoke-filled train are seen covering their mouths and noses)

Without a driver there was no one to move the second train. This, of course, prohibited the first train from returning to the station.  

A timeline of the incident released by the city states that the first respondent on the scene didn't arrive until more than an hour after the smoke was first reported. 

The passengers banded together in the incident, sharing water, sharing a bottle of wine, and even administering CPR to one woman, Carol Glover, who died in the incident.

'I just didn't see any way that we were going to get out of there because the smoke was encapsulating and all you could see out the window was darkness,' Rich said.
