Divorce papers filed by the wife of Matt Lauer nearly a decade ago which came out this week accuse the popular morning show host of some shocking behavior.

Annette Lauer filed the papers in 2006 stating that Matt valued his work over his family and was 'extremely controlling.'

Furthermore, Annette claimed at the time she suffered 'cruel and inhuman' treatment at the hands of her husband, who also demonstrated 'extreme anger and hostility towards her.'

It gets worse: Annette also claimed at the time that she suffered 'cruel and inhuman' treatment at the hands of her husband

The papers, obtained by The National Enquirer, also say that, 'The conduct of [Matt] so endangers the physical and mental well-being of [Annette] so as to render it unsafe and improper for plaintiff to cohabit with defendant.'

The couple had two sons at the time these papers were filed, Jack, then 5, and Romy, then 2, and would welcome a third child, Thijs,just two months later.

Annette, 48, a former model who was born in the Netherlands, married the Today host in 1998, just one year after he was made a co-anchor of the show, a job that now earns him a reported $25 million a year.

The papers also allege, 'Defendant has continuously and repeatedly given higher priority to … personal interests than to his family obligations to plaintiff, causing plaintiff to feel abandoned, isolated and alone in raising the parties’ children.'

Lastly, Annette said she endured 'continual mental abuse' from Matt.

Matt filed his own legal action days later, saying any 'cruel and inhuman treatment' he may have exhibited was 'provoked' by his wife. 

A source close to the couple said of the papers, 'These divorce papers were filed more than eight years ago and revoked three weeks later. In New York at that time, irreconcilable differences could not be considered grounds for divorce. A spouse had to prove cruel and in-humane or unsafe treatment, which meant that lawyers had to use those exact terms to establish grounds.' 

That same source added, 'Matt and Annette just happily celebrated their 16-year wedding anniversary over dinner with their three children.' 

Still going: The couple (left) just celebrated their 16-year wedding anniversary. Matt was briefly engaged to Kristen Gesswein (right).

All work: Matt makes a reported $25 million a year as the co-anchor of Today

Matt's first marriage, to television producer Nancy Alspaugh, ended in divorce in 1988.

He was also briefly engaged to television newscaster Kristen Gesswein, but they split in 1996, two years before he married Annette. 

NBC has yet to respond to a request for comment about these papers.
