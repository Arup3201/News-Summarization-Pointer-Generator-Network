Their 11-game winning streak may have come to an abrupt end after Saturday's horror show against Malaga, but Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Gerard Pique were still out and about the following night.

Amidst renewed talks of crisis at the Nou Camp after Juanmi's goal sent the La Liga title challengers crashing to their first home defeat since November 1, the pair were spotted outside the Casino de Barcelona at around midnight on Sunday.

Messi and Pique caught up with Chelsea midfielder and former Nou Camp team-mate Cesc Fabregas outside the Barcelona setting that houses poker tournaments, roulette and blackjack tables and serves a range of gastronomic delights in its numerous restaurants.

And while the boys from Barcelona were out together, Fabregas' wife Daniella Semaan posted a picture of herself enjoying a night in with Lionel Messi's other half Antonella Roccuzzo 'back home' in Barcelona.

Returning to his hometown to meet his former colleagues at the beach venue, Chelsea midfielder Fabregas will have brought his own tales of woe to distract his pals from their state of sorrow.

With his team on the end of some debatable refereeing decisions during their ill-tempered 1-1 draw against Burnley the previous day - just ask Jose Mourinho - Fabregas will be looking ahead to Sunday's Capital One Cup final clash with London rivals Tottenham, hoping that fortune will favour his side at Wembley.

Messi and Pique will no doubt be wishing their luck will also change after Saturday's loss as the Catalans' disappointing show meant they missed out on the opportunity to leapfrog arch rivals Real Madrid at the top of the La Liga table, and a win for Carlo Ancelotti's side the following day opened up a four-point gap.

Both players were subject to some criticism during the defeat, with Messi's performance at the Nou Camp, despite showing flickers of brightness, described as 'fretful' by Sportsmail's Oliver Holt. 

Two goals would have drawn him level with old foe Cristiano Ronaldo in the race for the 'Pichichi' (top scorer) trophy. Instead, his fruitless afternoon saw him fall further behind the Portuguese after his strike on Sunday capped a 2-0 win for Real at Elche.

Pique argues with the referee Juan Martinez Munuera before being booked in Saturday's La Liga loss

Pique, too, was collared for remonstrating a foul and received his fifth yellow card in La Liga this season to ensure he'll miss next weekend's away game against Granada.

So it's no surprise, then, that the trio were keen to let off some steam, but with Luis Enrique's men heading into a tough fixture against a rampant Manchester City side and whisperings of an end to Barcelona's hegemony in European football, it is vital his players get their heads down.

Against Malaga they showed a distinct lack of inventiveness despite flaunting a front three of Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, who appeared to fade into anonymity again behind his stellar strike partners.

Arriving at Manchester Airport a mere 13 hours after their visit to the casino, it will be straight back to work for Messi and Co as his side become increasingly dependent on him in times of self-doubt.

One thing we can be sure of is that Manuel Pellegrini and his men will be smelling blood heading into Tuesday night and the 27-year-old will have to be at his very best if Barcelona are to take home some faith. 

While Barcelona were struggling, City were handing out a pasting to Newcastle in the Premier League

Last season City were knocked out by Barcelona in the Champions League but will it be the same this time?
