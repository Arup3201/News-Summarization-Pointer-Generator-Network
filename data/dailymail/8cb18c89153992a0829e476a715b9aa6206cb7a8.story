An Icelandic man who purchased the last-ever McDonald's meal sold before the chain closed down in the country in 2009 was stunned when he found it did not go mouldy.

Hjortur Smarason, 28, waited until the end of the fast-food chain's last day to buy a cheeseburger together with a portion of fries.

He then donated his purchase to the National Museum of Iceland, where it stayed on display for three years before it was returned to him.

'I realised it was a historic occasion and decided to buy the last burger on sale in October 2009, which I donated to the local museum,' Mr Smarason said. 

'They had it on display until somebody complained and it was decided that a museum was not the appropriate place for food on display like this. 

'So they asked me for permission to destroy it.

'But I regard it as a historical item now. I think it's incredible that it seems to show no signs of decomposition, although apparently the fact that there were fewer chips returned to me was because some museum visitors had eaten some of them.'

The burger spent the first three years stored in a plastic bag when it did not change at all. 

In 2012, after he took it back from the museum, it went on display at the bar of his local hotel in the capital Reykjavik.

'We no longer have a McDonald's here, but we do have a McDonald's burger and it's probably the oldest in the world, so I reckon we shouldn't complain too much,' Mr Smarason said

Iceland is one of the only countries in the world that has no McDonald's. 

There used to be three branches of the fast food chain on the island until the 2009 financial crisis made it uneconomical to continue with the business.

With only 300,000 people in the country and the fact that Iceland is a remote island location, the company said that the 2009 financial crisis had been the kiss of death.
