Google has sent its Street View trike around the Large Hadron Collider and added it to the online service.

The search giant spent two weeks riding a special trike fitted with 360 degree cameras around the huge experiment to capture it.

Members of the public can now marvel at the sheer enormity of ATLAS as well as other giant machines at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva.

Members of the public can take in the 7000-tonne ATLAS detector, which is probing for fundamental particles including the Higgs Boson, using Google Street View

This view is of ALICE, a heavy-ion detector on the Large Hadron Collider ring that's designed to study the physics of strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities, where a phase of matter called quark-gluon plasma forms

The Science Museum in London is opening an exhibition this November to show the work of some 10,000 people across the globe to uncover the building blocks of the universe at the LHC 

The museum will use theatre and video as well as real artefacts from CERN to recreate the famous laboratory.

It promises to take visitors behind the scenes to witness the discovery of the Higgs boson and explore the 27km collider.

‘We’re delighted that CERN opened its doors to Google Maps Street View allowing anyone, anywhere in the world to take a peek into its laboratories, control centers and its myriad underground tunnels housing cutting-edge experiments,’ said Pascale Milite of Google.

CERN is the world's largest particle 
physics laboratory where some of the world’s best physicists and 
engineers use advanced particle accelerators to help solve age old 
questions about the universe like what it's made of and how it started.

Google has already sent its trikes, cars and backpacks everywhere from the Antarctic to the Grand Canyon.

It says the latest addition to Street View could even help scientists plan future experiments.

This is a view of the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment, which will shed light on why we live in a universe that appears to be composed almost entirely of matter, but no antimatter. It was set up to explore what happened after the Big Bang

The 27-km LHC tunnel holding the circumference accelerator ring of superconducting magnets, is pictured. Its job is to increase the energy of particles that will be smashed at detectors around the ring

‘Street View also lets scientists working on the experiments, who may be on the other side of the world, explore the equipment they're using.’

The Google team were able to capture the main experiments running at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory based in the suburbs of Geneva.

‘A team from Google, working with CERN personnel, took images across all of CERN’s sites using, among other things, a bike-mounted camera system known as the “Street View Trike”.

ATLAS (pictured) is a particle physics experiment that is searching for new discoveries in the head-on collisions of protons of extraordinarily high energy. It aims to learn about forces that shaped our Universe since and that will determine its fate, including the dimensions of space and evidence of dark matter

A year ago, the world's largest particle collider identified what is believed to be the Higgs boson.

But the experiment is now on a break as work is pushing ahead to give the vast machines an upgrade.

The 27km circular lab went offline in February for an 18-month overhaul.

When experiments resume in 2015, scientists at CERN will use its enhanced power to probe dark matter, dark energy and super symmetry.

They also explored parts of the Large Hadron Collider tunnel and four experiments: ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb,’ said Dan Noyes of CERN.

Six-sided panoramic images were taken every three metres and four experiments were photographed, as well as 1200 metres of the LHC tunnel.

The entire project generated 6,000 points that were coordinated with GPS locations to create a virtual tour of the laboratory.

The project is ongoing and will expand and offer views of more of CERN experiments, Noyes said.

This view is of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), a general-purpose detector at the Large Hadron Collider that's designed to investigate a wide range of physics, including the search for the Higgs boson, extra dimensions and particles that could make up dark matter

CMS is 25 metres long, 15 metres in diameter, and weighs about 12,500 tons. Approximately 3,800 people from 42 countries built and now operate the detector. In July 2012, along with ATLAS, CMS discovered a boson, which is very similar to the Standard Model Higgs Particle
