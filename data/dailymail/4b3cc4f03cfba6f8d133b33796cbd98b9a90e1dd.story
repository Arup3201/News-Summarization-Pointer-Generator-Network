Tragic: Jamie Rolfe plunged to his death down a 300ft ravine in the French Alps, an inquest heard

A young British ski chalet rep plunged to his death down a 320ft ravine in the French Alps while drunk, an inquest heard today.

Jamie Rolfe, 27, shared a bottle of wine and drunk several pints and a shot before leaving his friend's house at 4.30am in Les Deux Alpes ski resort, near Grenoble.

He walked to the 'Edge of the World' ravine - a remote spot where he used to go to admire the stars - before tragically falling into it.

Mr Rolfe, from Newport, Isle of Wight, had been spending the winter season working in his 'dream job' for tour operator Skiworld, while making a snowboarding film. 

He had visited two bars and a nightclub with friends on January 26, 2011, before making his way to friend Michael Turner’s apartment at 2am to continue partying.

He could have stayed overnight with his group of friends, but chose to leave at 4.30am - instead heading for the high beauty spot. 

Mr Rolfe's concerned manager raised the alarm at 6.30pm the following day after repeated attempts to call the young rep had failed.

A police search was launched and Mr Rolfe's body was discovered 50-200 feet down the steep Venosc Combe Noire ravine.

Today, Assistant Coroner Hugh Calloway said the spot - which offered 'beautiful views' - had previously claimed the lives of seven others.

'The attraction of these places is the danger as well, I suppose,' he told the hearing in Newport.

'Snowboarders have a sense of danger and it’s difficult to have the adrenaline buzz without the risk.

'This is an absolutely tragic death. It
is easy to see Jamie was obviously a much-loved person who enjoyed what 
he did and died doing it.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Calloway said Mr Rolfe - a Film Studies graduate - had told his friends he was 'returning home' after leaving Mr Turner's apartment.

'Wednesday was change over day at the resort and Jamie and his friends went out to various pubs and clubs as young people do,' he said.

'He went back to a friend’s at around 4.30am, but decided to leave Michael’s flat and said he was going to return home.

'Obviously we do not have any evidence of what occurred after he left but it was a clear night and the stars were shining brightly.'

He added: 'Jamie obviously suffered a severe head injury and died instantly and there is no reason to suspect that his death was anything other than a tragic accident.

'It is clear there had been six or seven previous deaths there, including a couple the previous year and Jamie was the eighth person to die there.'

Today, Mr Rolfe’s parents said they were 'shocked and devastated' by the death of their son, whom they described as a 'lively, free spirit'. 

His father Roger Rolfe, 67, a retired therapist, told the court: 'It was an exceptionally clear starry night and Jamie had been known to go and watch the stars at the ravine. It had a magnificent view but it was risky.

'A French official said to us that they can’t chain the whole mountain off. Young men like to go and watch the sky there at night.'

Mr Rolfe said his son had loved his job and had planned to move to China - where he had taught English - to be with his girlfriend Xiao Bei.

Speaking outside court, he said: 'Jamie packed more into 27 years than most people do in a lifetime.

'It was typical of him that he loved to go and look at the stars and the sunrise. He loved night.

'If you look at the drop he fell off it’s phenomenal, hundreds and hundreds of feet high. He fell off and hit a ledge, we were told, and think he probably fell backwards looking at the stars.

'The only blessing is that his death would have been quick.'

Mrs Rolfe, who works for the NHS, said her son’s friends had raised funds to put a memorial plaque at the spot, which carries his Chinese nickname - Dhengi - meaning 'Little Rice'.

'Hopefully this might make other young men more cautious,' she added. 

Toxicology reports revealed Mr Rolfe would have been 'severely intoxicated', with 2.97 grams of alcohol per litre in his blood, and 4.15 grams in his urine.

Post mortems in both France and the UK confirmed the cause of death as multiple traumatic injuries.

In 2009, two other British holidaymakers Richard Ryan, 27, and Christopher Lockwood, 28, were found dead at the ravine.

The pair had been drinking in a tavern and left at 2am. It is believed they lost their footing and plunged hundreds of feet to their deaths.
