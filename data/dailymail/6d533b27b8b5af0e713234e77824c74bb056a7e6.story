Leading GPs are in revolt over a controversial NHS scheme to pay them £55 for every new case of dementia they record.

They branded it ‘unethical’ and warn it will lead to patients being wrongly diagnosed, with ‘truly tragic consequences’.

The scheme was launched by NHS England last month to boost worryingly low detection rates of dementia – currently less than half of cases are picked up.

Practices will be paid £55 for every new case recorded until April.

But more than 50 leading GPs, academics and campaigners have written to the head of the NHS, Simon Stevens, and Alistair Burns, the national clinical director for dementia, voicing ‘serious concerns’.

In a joint letter, published in the BMJ, they warn that ‘misdiagnosis is a real possibility’ as dementia is difficult to confirm in the early stages and often based on a doctor’s opinion. 

They fear it could lead to patients being wrongly labelled as having the illness which would incur ‘truly tragic consequences’, as the diagnosis would cause huge anxiety and distress for patients and their families and it could be years before mistakes were realised.

It goes on to say that the scheme sets a ‘dangerous precedent’ and risks undermining patients’ trust.

The letter was written by Dr Martin Brunet, a GP from Guildford, Surrey, who is regarded as an authority on dementia, and signed by Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, as well as a number of Oxford and Cambridge academics.

The homes of patients going to hospital after falls should be checked for hazards such as loose carpets, clutter and cables, say health watchdogs

The homes of patients going to hospital after falls should be checked for hazards such as loose carpets, clutter and cables, say health watchdogs.

New guidelines also tell staff to look for other risks like low tables, baths which are hard to get out of and even pets.

The assessments should be carried out each time an elderly person falls and sees a GP or hospital doctor, says NICE.

The watchdogs said falls are the leading cause of death in the over-75s and cost the NHS an estimated £2.3billion a year. 

Almost a third of the over-65s fall over at least once a year and 1 in 20 need to go to hospital. The tests and any necessary action are carried out by specialists, including nurses working for NHS trusts.

NICE added that patients prone to falling should be referred for exercises to improve balance, like tai chi and yoga.

Professor Gillian Leng, NICE deputy chief executive, said: ‘Every hospital fall costs on average £1,215. If we can reduce falls, people not only get safer care but it could also help achieve cost savings.’

Dr Brunet said last night: ‘They shouldn’t be asking us to do this and I really don’t want to have anything to do with this money at all.

‘We shouldn’t be in a position where money comes into the moment of diagnosis – there shouldn’t be incentives.’

Other leading GPs who have put their names to the letter include Iona Heath, former president of the Royal College of GPs and Laurence Buckman, previously chairman of the GPs committee at the British Medical Association.

Dr Martin McShane, NHS England’s national clinical director for people with long-term-conditions, said: ‘Our aim is that every patient with dementia gets the best treatment and the right support as early as possible.’
