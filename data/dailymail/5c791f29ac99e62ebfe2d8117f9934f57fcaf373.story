It will be a good few years until Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall hear their daughter utter the typical teenage cry of 'Dad, you're so embarrassing!'

Hopefully the England rugby player will have packed the trousers he wore to a charity golf tournament away by then or he will be adding fuel to his daughter's fire. Â 

The four-month-year old was in ignorant bliss of her father's style statement as she was taken to watch him play golf today by doting mother Zara.

His biggest fan: Zara took baby Mia along to watch in a denim sun hat

In keeping with golf fashion trends, the 35-year-old wore a loud pair of graphic print trousers with a rugby shirt as he took part in the Celebrity Golf Classic.

He was hosting the event in support of Rugby for Heroes and the On Course Foundation at the Celtic Manor Resort, Newport, Wales. Mike is a patron for the charity and hosted the tournament to raise money for the cause.

The golf game comes after he recently spent a weekend away in Barcelona with friends.

Zara, 33, followed her husband's progress throughout the golf tournament by pushing their daughter around the course in her buggy. She then bought her out for a cuddle.

The Queen's granddaughter looked relaxed and happy in jeans and a navy top with sunglasses.

On the hottest day of the year so far, she ensured her little girl kept cool in a pale dress with a denim sun hat to protect her delicate skin from the rays.

She was joined her by sister-in-law Autumn Phillips, who seemed to enjoy spending time with her new niece.

Other celebrities taking part in today's golf tournament included Dragon's Den businessman Peter Jones, Olympic rower Sir Steve Redgrave and TV presenters Zoe Hardman and Natalie Pinkham.

Zara will present the coveted Tin's Trophy to the winner later today.

The couple first hosted the golf tournament last year.

In this year's invitation, Mike wrote: 'The inaugural event was a huge success and was attended by a variety of great companies with a fantastic collection of celebrities who generously gave their time to enjoy the day with our guests. Most importantly, we raised a substantial amount of much needed funds for the charities that we chose to support.

'As patron of Rugby For Heroes I felt that this was a good opportunity to raise funds to provide support and assistance for individuals as they make the transition from the military back into civilian life.

He added: 'The day promises to be a fantastic experience. A competitive round of golf played on Celtic Manor's stunning Twenty Ten course followed by an evening of fun.'

Referring to his royal wife, he joked: 'I always feel that "A Happy Wife is a Happy Life" so this year we are encouraging our golfers to invite their partners for a day of relaxation at Celtic Manor and to join us for dinner & drinks in the evening.'
