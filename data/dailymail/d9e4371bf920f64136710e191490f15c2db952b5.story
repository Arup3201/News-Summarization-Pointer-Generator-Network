It's clearly the handiwork of someone who’s had to deal with one automated call centre too many.

A new website is mapping out how to get past the infuriating telephone menus that greet you when you call your bank, insurer or the tax office.

The bane of virtually anyone who needs to access a service over the phone, companies’  interminable list of recorded ‘options’ never seem to quickly offer the department you want.

Nigel Clarke, 53, has catalogued the intricate phone menus of hundreds of leading companies and posted the results to his website

The website of shortcuts, created by 
IT manager Nigel Clarke, offers the correct sequences of numbers to dial
 to have your call properly directed.

Fed up with wasting time listening to 
endless recorded options, Mr Clarke, a father-of-three, catalogued the 
intricate phone menus of 130 leading companies, some of which have up to
 80 options available.

He describes call centre menu options 
as the ‘modern equivalent of Dante’s circles of hell’ and reckons his 
free shortcuts could save consumers more than eight minutes per call by 
short-circuiting up to seven options.

A Lloyds TSB home insurance 
customer, for example, who wishes to report a water leak would normally 
have to wade through 78 menu options over seven levels to get through to
 the correct department.

But, according to the website, 
www.pleasepress1.com, simply dialling 1-3-2-1-1-5-4 will get you 
straight through – saving about four minutes’ waiting time.

Mr Clarke, 53, who estimates he has 
made 12,000 calls to automated phone centres over the years both in and 
outside his work, said: ‘Whether calling a phone, insurance or energy 
company, they each had a different and often worse way of trying to 
“help” me.

‘I could sit there for minutes that 
seemed like hours, trying to get through their phone menus only to end 
up at the wrong place and having to redial and start again.

'The 
cumulative effect is quite devastating when you’re moving house or 
having an issue.’

Mr Clarke, who lives in Fawkham, Kent,
 began noting down the menu options and soon realised he could shave 
several minutes off the waiting time.

The former project manager for UK 
Power Networks now works as a consultant as well as developing the site.

He cites the HMRC as one of the worst 
offenders, where it can take up to six minutes to reach the correct 
department.

Mr Clarke believes the service could save consumers up to one billion minutes a year

It receives 79million calls per year – equivalent to a 
potential 4.3million hours just navigating menus.

Others include Direct Line Insurance’s
 business customer service, with 107 options over three menu levels, and
 Argos store enquiries, with 73 options over five levels.

Mr Clarke is now calling for firms to submit the codes themselves to create an ‘official’ directory of shortcuts.

‘It doesn’t cost them anything to submit the codes and it saves everyone a lot of time and money,’ he said.
