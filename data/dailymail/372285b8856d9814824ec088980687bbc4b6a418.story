Ann Pascoe's husband Andrew had always been a gentle, mild-mannered man. So
 when he was diagnosed with dementia seven years ago, she expected him 
to be forgetful and become more dependent - what she was not ready for 
were his aggressive outbursts.

Andrew,
 65, a former naval engineer, had always had a caring nature. 'Yet after
 he developed dementia, from time to time he would get very agitated - 
sometimes he would throw things - for no  reason,' says Ann, 67, a 
businesswomen.

'He might 
come in from the garden and just suddenly shout: “I'm not doing it any 
more,” and slam the door and storm up upstairs.

After Andrew developed dementia, from time to time he would get very agitated - and even throw things

'It was incredibly upsetting and I was permanently walking on eggshells but thought that this must just be part of the dementia.

'I was getting to the stage where I felt I couldn't cope any more.'

Then,
 last August, she discovered there was more to these outbursts than she 
realised. Andrew, who tries to lead as independent a life as possible, 
had fainted at the bus stop in the village near where the couple live in
 Helmsdale, Scotland.

An 
ambulance was called and a doctor found Ann's details in Andrew's wallet
 and called her. 'He said Andrew seemed very confused and was mentioning
 something about pain but wasn't making much sense,' she recalls.

In
 fact, Andrew had been diagnosed with neuropathic (nerve) pain in his 
legs two years before. 'He'd tried a variety of painkillers and said 
they didn't work, but now I wonder if he took them,' says Ann.

'He had said he was hurting from time to time but as he had not been very specific I had not taken it that seriously.'

The
 doctor suggested Ann keep a 'pain diary' for her husband for two weeks,
 getting him to rate his discomfort on a scale of one to ten at various 
times of the day. 'When he was sitting down he said it was a two out of 
ten; when he walked in the garden it was as high as a nine,' she says.

Ann Pascoe from Helmsdale, Scottish Highlands is now dealing with her husbands's dementia

Analysing
 the diary, the doctor realised Andrew was in considerable pain a lot of
 the time and prescribed him Gabapentin, an epilepsy drug that 
interrupts the transmission of pain signals in the brain.

This
 time Ann watched her husband like a hawk to ensure he took it and, sure
 enough, the aggressive outbursts all but stopped. 'Now I realise that 
his agitation was not the dementia - it was a result of his pain - he 
just didn't know how to tell me,' she says.

Andrew told Ann he often couldn't find the words to explain many everyday events - including his levels of pain.

The
 couple's story highlights an extraordinary new understanding of the 
behaviour of dementia patients - and could help transform their, and 
their carers', lives.

For
 a growing body of research has found that many of the symptoms often 
written off as 'just a part of dementia' - agitation, aggression, 
withdrawal or repeatedly asking for attention - are actually untreated 
pain.

Indeed, pain is 
the biggest cause of such symptoms - including even language breakdown 
-  according to a recent review in the journal Clinical Intervention In 
Ageing.

However, the 
authors concluded that while pain is often the underlying cause of some 
behaviour, patients may be given 'inappropriate' sedating medication 
instead.

It's not that 
dementia causes pain, but the 800,000 people in this country with the 
disease tend to be older and therefore more prone to aches and pains. 
Many patients lose the ability to talk, but even those who are coherent 
may struggle to find the right words to describe their discomfort.

The
 problem is that not all health professionals or carers are yet aware of
 this, so they dismiss changes to behaviour such as becoming agitated as
 part of dementia, says Pat Schofield, professor of nursing at the 
University of Greenwich.

'Historically,
 we used to believe that people with dementia do not feel pain because 
of the effects that their illness has on the brain but in recent years 
we realised that is not so,' she adds. 'They are just as likely to 
suffer with pain but they cannot express it.

'Think
 how frustrating that must be - you can't find the words to tell 
someone, “I'm in agony”, or, “This is hurting”,' says Prof Schofield.

Scientists
 from King's College London and Norway found that when they gave daily 
pain treatment to patients with 'significant behavioural disturbance', 
their agitation was 'severely reduced'.

Their
 study, published in the British Medical Journal in 2011, said that 
properly treating pain could reduce 'unnecessary prescriptions for 
psychotropic drugs' - drugs such as antipsychotics.

For
 years, agitated or aggressive dementia patients have been given 
antipsychotics, which act on the brain and sedates them. In 2009, a 
government-funded report found that 180,000 dementia patients in England
 were on antipsychotics, yet it estimated as few as 36,000 were getting 
any benefit.

Furthermore,
 the drugs carry a risk of significant side-effects - the report 
suggested they were linked to 1,620 strokes a year and an additional 
1,800 deaths.

'In the past,
 there was a tendency to think, “Oh dear, this patient is agitated, we 
better give them a chemical cosh,” rather than think, “What could be 
causing this?”' says London GP Dr Sarah Jarvis, who contributed to a 
recent report on dementia and pain.

'Then there were anxieties about the drugs' side-effects, and we are using them less and less.'

However,
 prescriptions are still too high. A two-year study completed last April
 by University College London and funded by the Alzheimer's Society 
found that three-quarters of dementia patients in hospital displayed 
agitation or aggression and that 'staff are  still using sedative and 
neuroleptic drugs to manage these'. The problem, suggests Dr Jarvis, is 
that while 'the message has got across that we should be prescribing 
fewer antipsychotics, still health professionals are not necessarily 
thinking of pain as a cause [for challenging behaviour]'.

Many
 dementia patients end up in care homes. Dr Jarvis says she often finds 
staff are unaware of the link between agitation and pain.

'I've
 lost count of the number of times that I have had a dementia patient 
not on antipsychotics and the care home will say to me: "But they seem 
to become agitated."

'I
 will suggest pain as a cause and they will say: “No, it can't be - they
 aren't agitated all the time.” But the point is, pain does tend to come
 and go.'

Andrew told Ann he often couldn't find the words to explain many everyday events - including pain

A recent report 
by Napp Pharmaceuticals found that a third of independent care and 
residential homes had not reduced their antipsychotic use.

Furthermore,
 nearly 40 per cent said fewer than a quarter of their dementia patients
 suffer with pain, yet surveys (such as one in Clinical Intervention In 
Ageing) have found 50 per cent of dementia patients suffer with regular 
pain and that the figure will be higher for those in care or residential
 homes.

'A better awareness
 of pain could transform the care of dementia patients,' says Dr 
Jarvis.  Yet often carers like Ann have to deal with this challenging 
behaviour unaware that their loved one's outburst might be easily cured 
with pain medication.

'Every
 day I see carers who are at the end of their tether and come in and ask
 for tranquilisers to help with their loved ones behaviour,' says Dr 
Jarvis.

'But we have to say to them first: “We need to try and find out what is causing this behaviour.” 'Now
 there is a move, backed by the Alzheimer's Society and other 
campaigners, to better identify and treat people with dementia who are 
in pain.

'All too 
often people with dementia suffering from unrecognised pain are 
mistakenly deemed to be aggressive, uncooperative or withdrawn,' says Dr
 Alison Cook, of the Alzheimer's Society.

'It is vitally important that care professionals have the tools and training to meet the complex needs of people with dementia.'

It's a move welcomed by Ann.

'We
 carers need to be told what to look for, what to expect,' she says. 'I 
am sure there will have been people who will have been caring for loved 
ones who will have thought they can't cope and sent their loved one off 
to a home when actually had the pain been treated they could have 
carried on.

'I'm relieved 
not just that Andrew is less agitated but also that he has a better 
quality of life. 'I plan to care for him for the duration of his 
illness.

'A year ago, I was thinking: "I hate this." Now I feel as if our life is back on track.'
