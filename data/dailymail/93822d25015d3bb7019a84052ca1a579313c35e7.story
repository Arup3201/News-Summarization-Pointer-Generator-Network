A mother who was once hailed a hero for protecting her family from intruders is now standing trial for the murder of her 20-year-old neighbour in an attempt to frame her ex-husband.

Tracey Richter Roberts, 45, is accused of shooting Dustin Wehde nine times, including three times in the back of the head, at her home in Early, Iowa in December, 2001.

The mother-of-three was arrested in July in Omaha, Nebraska after the case was reopened. She faces life in prison if found guilty. 

In cold blood? Tracey Richter Roberts is accused of shooting her neighbour nine times in 2001 at her home in Early, Iowa

It was originally thought that Wehde 
broke into Roberts’ home with an accomplice and attacked her before she 
broke free, made it to a gun safe in her bedroom and fired two pistols 
to fend them off.

She claimed she acted in self-defence and was hailed a hero by some gun rights advocates and TV personality Montel Williams, who applauded her story on national television.

Prosecutors now claim that Roberts shot Wehde nine times in cold blood after luring him to her home on December 13 ten years ago, before planting a notebook in his car that implied her first husband, John Pitman, had hired the young man to kill her over a child-custody dispute.

Prosecutor Douglas Hammerand told jurors at the court in Dodge City that Roberts forced Wehde to write in a pink spiral notebook that he was hired by a 'mysterious fellow' named John Pitman, who divorced the woman in 1996, to kill her and her 11-year-old son Bert.

She allegedly killed Wehde, a special education student, because she felt she couldn't trust him to keep the secret of her plan to frame her ex-husband. 

Prosecutors also said Roberts made up the report of a second intruder.

Mr Hammerand, assistant attorney general, said: 'The pink spiral notebook contained information only someone involved in the crime would know.'

The details included the name of Pitman's divorce attorney, but the plastic surgeon from Virginia will testify he never met Wehde, the prosecutor said.

The first witness, Marie Friedman, said she was friends with Roberts because their husbands worked together.

Mrs Friedman showed up at Roberts' 
home on December 13 planning to spend the night because their husbands 
were travelling together on business.

Roberts told her Wehde had been at the house earlier asking about work and she was glad 
he left because he creeped her out.

Mrs Friedman said she was surprised when Roberts cancelled their stay-over. The woman left after the pair had tea and a chat.

Her husband Ray Friedman, recalled 
how he and Roberts' husband Michael were driving home from Minneapolis 
when they heard about the shooting. He said he let Mr Roberts drive his 
car home because he could navigate dirt roads faster.

The Friedmans, who now live in 
Florida, said they saw the accused at the hospital and she was 
distraught over the alleged home invasion and had red marks on her neck.

Mrs Friedman said: 'Everything Tracey
told me, it appeared to be that way to me. There was no question in my 
mind that she would not be telling the truth.'

Lawyer for Roberts, Scott Bandstra, said 
the prosecution never followed up on leads to find the second man and 
that a forensic re-enactment last year by investigators is 
consistent with her original statement.

'It's a travesty,' the lawyer said. 'She should be given a medal, not charges.'

Mr Bandstra said the evidence will show Wehde had a history of mental health issues and aggressive behavior.

Roberts' brother, John Richter, a Chicago police detective said: 'Everything in their charges is theory, but a theory isn't based on fact.

'They could never find the second 
suspect, so they assumed that her testimony was false. I should use that
at work the next time I can't find a suspect in a homicide.'

Wehde was found slumped at the 
bottom of a bed at Tracey and Michael Roberts’ home in a
pool of blood. A bullet had gone through his head and out of his eye 
socket.

Tracey Roberts was heard screaming in
the kitchen with her three children and deputies. Her report that two 
other intruders escaped sent deputies canvassing everywhere and fear 
spread in the town.

She 
claimed that with her husband on a business trip, she was home with her 
three young children - Bert, Noah and Mason - when Dustin and another 
man barged through her unlocked door.

Roberts said one of the men choked her 
with panty hose, she lost her glasses and blacked out and woke to the 
sound of Bert screaming, who was holding a baseball bat to protect his 
younger siblings.

She said she ran to the bedroom and 
reached for the gun safe, as Wehde tugged at her hair and yanked on her
feet. When the safe opened, she grabbed a 9mm handgun and pulled the 
trigger.

Then she said she grabbed a revolver, 
spotted the young man moving and fired at him. He stopped moving and the second
man fled. She later said it was only one man, not two, who got away.

An investigation remained open but no second intruder was found and no charges were filed as of late 2002.

This year, Sac County, where the crime took place gained a new prosecutor, Ben Smith, who went over the old case files and had Roberts charged with first-degree murder in July.

The trial continues.
