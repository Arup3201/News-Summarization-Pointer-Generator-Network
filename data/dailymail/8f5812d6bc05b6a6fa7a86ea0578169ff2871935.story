An American teenager is eager to become a citizen of the country she was born in, but has had no luck thanks to her parents decision to never legally register her. 

Alecia Pennington, 19, claims that she was born at home and then never sent to school, taught instead by her mother.

What's more, her parents never got her a birth certificate or a social security number she claims, which has made it impossible for her to receive any of the rights of an American citizen.

However, her mother, Lisa Pennington, is telling a far different story.

The 19-year-old is therefore unable to show proof of her identity, and cannot get a birth certificate

Alecia has made a video in a bid to get some support, or help, obtaining the documents she claims to need to declare herself an American citizen.

'I was homeschooled my entire life, so I had no school records,' Pennington explains. 

'Also, never been to the hospital, so I have no medical records. This leaves me with nothing to prove my identity or citizenship.' 

Should this be true, she would be a victim of identification abuse.

It seems that Alecia, who is one of nine children, left her home last September, with the help of her grandparents on her mother's side.

Alecia's mother Lisa (left with Alecia and her three sisters) claims her daughter is misleading people

Her mother, a popular blogger in the homeschool community, wrote about this, but has since taken the post down on her blog, The Pennington Point.

Mrs. Pennington also posted a video in response to Alecia's video on YouTube, but took that down as well. 

Alecia does have older siblings, and it is unclear if they have licenses or any form of identification, though her mother has claimed they do.

She also claims that her daughter does have a birth certificate to the best of her knowledge. 

It is also worth noting that after Alecia released this video and started a Help Me Prove It Facebook and Twitter page, her father bought the domain name, making it impossible for her to use. 

Mr. Pennington, a tax lawyer, claims that he and his wife just want to speak to their daughter, and she is free to do as she wishes.
