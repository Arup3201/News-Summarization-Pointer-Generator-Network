A thug who used his pet as a punch bag has escaped prison, but will never be allowed to own dogs again.

Christopher Davies, 35, was given a 12-week suspended jail sentence, barred from ever keeping animals and ordered to pay £1,000 in legal costs.

In the attack on April 7 he  was caught on CCTV repeatedly punching and kicking his pet Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Max

The thug was also seen delivering upper cuts to the terrified animal with his mobile phone as he sat on a park bench in Chelmsford, Essex.

Max  was removed from the brute's home the next day in a bid to protect it from further unprovoked attacks.

Davies was questioned by a welfare officer before becoming the first person in the city to be pursued by Chelmsford City Council through the Animal Welfare Act 2006.

He failed to appear for his trial at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court, but was still found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.

Anne Brewer, chairman of the bench, told Davies: 'This attack was brutal, in a public place where children were present.'

Kate Armstrong, defending, had told the court Davies knew it was not the way to treat a dog and that he had expressed remorse for his actions.

Speaking after the sentencing on June 4, council public health and protection services manager Paul Brookes, said: 'The cameras captured the incident and it was quite clear the dog was being beaten for no apparent reason.

'The footage was shown to a vet who agreed that the animal would have suffered, and an officer from animal welfare also had the view that further action needed to be taken as it constituted an unprovoked attack.'

Ian Grundy, Chelmsford City Council's cabinet member for safer communities, added: 'This prosecution sends a clear message that abuse of animals will not be tolerated in Chelmsford.'

Davies has been stripped of his ownership of Max which is now in kennels awaiting a new home.
