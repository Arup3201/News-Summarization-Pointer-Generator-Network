Bravery: Newsreader Carolyn Brown is going under the knife next month to donate a kidney to her husband of 18 months Bruce Connell

Newsreader Carolyn Brown is to donate a kidney to her new husband, she revealed yesterday.

The BBC Radio 4 stalwart will go under the knife next month.

Her husband Bruce Connell has been on medication since his own kidneys began to deteriorate more than eight years ago.

He praised the bravery of his wife and other donors in selflessly ‘putting their life on the line’ by volunteering for major surgery to help others.

Mrs Brown, 57, joked: ‘We’ve only been married 18 months. I thought he was marrying me because of my cosy little cottage in the country, it turns out he was after my spare parts.’

The pair met six years ago and married in summer 2011, just a few months before Mr Connell learned he needed a kidney transplant.

He said his kidneys had been in ‘slow decline’ since he had a stroke eight years ago and last year he was told they had deteriorated so much that he would need regular dialysis if a transplant donor was not found.

Mrs Brown, a Radio 4 newsreader and continuity announcer since 1991, said she had no hesitation over becoming his donor.

She said on Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour: ‘I’ve always felt quite ambivalent about donor cards, one of those people who thinks it’s something I ought to do but never quite got around to it.

'I knew very little about dialysis. I just knew how incredibly disruptive it is and how going into hospital three times a week for three or four hours just turns your life upside down.

‘So, as soon as all this got talked about, I thought transplant is the way we have got to go if we can.’

Mrs Brown laughed off suggestions she was ‘wonderful and selfless’.  She said: ‘I’m doing it for very selfish reasons, I’m doing it to preserve my life and Bruce’s life and our life together.’

Two teams of surgeons will operate next month. One will remove Mrs Brown’s left kidney and it will be cooled and cleaned before the second team transplant it into Mr Connell.

Risk: The Radio 4 presented has said she knows the procedure is 'serious' but expects to be back to work in six weeks

Mrs Brown said she knew it was ‘a serious operation’ and added: ‘I’m not underestimating it, but the recovery period is very short, I will be back at work probably in six weeks and I’m hoping to go skiing in March.’

Consultant transplant surgeon Paul Gibbs said organ donations between couples had become more common because advances in immune-suppressing medication meant an exact tissue match was no longer needed.

Mr Gibbs, of the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, said waiting lists for transplants meant patients without donors could wait for years for a kidney.

He added: ‘There’s between 6,500 and 7,000 people who are on the waiting list and only just over 2,000 a year get a transplant.’
