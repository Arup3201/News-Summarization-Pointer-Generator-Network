If beleaguered Anthony Weiner fails in his bid to win New York's upcoming mayoral election, it turns out he at least has a fallback option... as a British television presenter.

But when that day finally comes, whatever you do, just don't ask him to do the weather.

In his latest cringe-worthy performance in front of the cameras, the former Congressman attempted to deflect a tough question from an English reporter in New York yesterday by answering in a bizarre fake-British accent.

And if witnesses thought it couldn't get any worse, he then tried to melt the joke's frosty reception by attempting to perform an English weather forecast.

Scroll down for video.

'Am I in a Monty Python sketch?' Anthony Weiner appeared to mock British television reporter Lucy Watson when she asked him if anything would stop him after a campaign event

Odd behaviour: Deploying a bizarre fake-British accent, Weiner told ITV's Daybreak, 'I just have a feeling I've like stepped into a Monty Python bit... 'I don't know would anything stop me?' Now is a rock going to fall on my head?'

The achingly awkward episode began when ITV Daybreak's Lucy Watson asked him after a campaign event if anything would stop him in his bid to be the city's new mayor.

Laughing, he said: 'I just have a feeling I've like stepped into a Monty Python bit...

'I don't know would anything stop me?' Now is a rock going to fall on my head?'

And as any comedian worth his salt knows, the best way to comeback after a joke falls on its face is to swiftly tell better one.

So he offered: 'Is there anything else I can do for ITV? Do you want me to do the weather or something?'

As reporter Lucy Watson duly obliged, he said: 'It's going to be rainy, cloudy and grey so do what you can guys, try to keep your head up and keep a stiff upper lip.'

He was perhaps unaware that Britain has, ironically, been enjoying its hottest and driest summer for almost ten years. 

Not so sunny: He then did a mock report on the UK weather, advising Brits to 'keep a stiff upper lip'

It is the latest of a string of gaffes by Weiner, whose poll lead has evaporated following revelations that he continued to exchange sexually explicit messages online after he resigned from Congress in 2011.

It comes just months after Mr Weiner resigned as a Congressman amid a massive sex scandal that burst his well-known career in flames.

The New Yorker was caught sending sexually explicit photos to a bevy of young women on Twitter.

Humiliation: New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin attend a news conference in New York last month

After initially denying the authenticity of the photos, he was forced to admit that he had in fact been sending them while he was married to his wife, Huma Abedin.

He and Ms Abedin, a longtime personal aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were married for less than a year when the photos were discovered and the scandal tarnished his name.

Adding another layer of disgrace to the situation was the fact that Ms Abedin was pregnant with the couple's first child- Jordan- when the scandal broke in May of last year.

Ms Abedin stood by her husband, however, and kept busy at work with Ms Clinton while they weathered the storm of bad publicity.

Known for his brash personality and lofty career aspirations - he was expected to run for Mayor of New York City after Michael Bloomberg's term ends next year - Mr Weiner has been keeping an uncharacteristically low profile.

But it is not the first gaffe he has made in front of the cameras. He recently raised eyebrows at a political meeting in Brooklyn when he suggested that an elderly woman in the audience might be flirting with him.

Weiner was taking questions from attendees at a Friends of the United Block Association of Brooklyn meeting when he noticed a gesture from one woman.

‘Were you raising your hand or flirting with me?’ Weiner asked the woman, who had tentatively raised her hand.
