Aston Villa's season has been plunged into deep uncertainty after Roy Keane quit as Paul Lambert’s assistant.

Keane left the club with immediate effect on Friday just five months after taking up the role as Lambert’s right-hand man, citing an inability to perform his duties alongside those of being Martin O’Neill’s No 2 with Republic of Ireland.

The timing of Keane’s departure raised questions and sparked shock among the Villa squad, however. It came on the eve of a crucial Premier League match at Burnley and just hours after he took training at Bodymoor Heath. Ireland do not have another match until March.

Roy Keane had joined Paul Lambert as assistant manager at Aston Villa in July, but quit after just six months

Keane was still taking training on Thursday ahead of the shock announcement on Friday morning

IRELAND - 2002

Walks out of the World Cup, telling boss Mick McCarthy: ‘I didn’t rate you as a player, I don’t rate you as a manager, and I don’t rate you as a person.’

MAN UTD - 2005

Criticises team-mates on MUTV before telling Sir Alex Ferguson: ‘We need f***ing more from you.’

SUNDERLAND - 2008

After he resigns, his players allegedly celebrate his departure.

IPSWICH - 2011

Promises Premier League promotion but is sacked when he fails to deliver.

But it is understood Keane had become increasingly disillusioned with working at Villa in recent weeks and continued for as long as he felt able.

There are believed to have been clashes with players over training intensity — Keane’s high standards are well-known — and he has notably been more withdrawn during matches.

There was also understood to be a growing dislike for his journey from his Cheshire home to Bodymoor Heath each day, a trip that takes one hour, 45 minutes.

O’Neill admitted last night he had spoken to Keane about Villa at their recent international get-together, and that a desire for more time with his wife and children also played a part.

‘Roy being the perfectionist that he is, he wanted to give everything to every single cause. But I think family time, at the minute, that’s something that was missing,’ said the former Villa manager.

Keane’s departure at this stage in the season places huge strain on Lambert, however. Villa have lost six of their last eight Premier League games and only scored six times all season — leaving them two points above the relegation zone.

Steve Clarke, the former West Bromwich Albion head coach, has emerged as a potential successor to Keane, but the Villa manager had further words to worry supporters over Fabian Delph.

Keane, seen in training on Thursday, said he did not feel it was fair to either employer to keep doing both jobs

Lambert revealed the England midfielder might be sold when the winter window opens as he shows little inclination to sign a new contract.

Delph, currently out with a shoulder injury, is a free agent in the summer but is attracting interest from Liverpool and Tottenham and Lambert may decide to cash in before he is able to leave for nothing.

Lambert said. ‘You are never sure what can happen. With the Bosman ruling the player holds the cards. I know that because I’ve done it myself.’

With Ron Vlaar likely to move clubs in January, Villa fans hope Keane is the only other figure to leave. His sudden departure, which echoes that of the 2002 World Cup with Ireland, is a ‘sorry loss’, according to Darren Bent.

Aston Villa won three of their first four league games with Keane at the club, but haven't won any since

Keane has been in his role with Ireland for a year, and took the Villa job in July on top of that

The striker has signed on loan for Brighton and said: ‘What people most respected about him was that he would tell you how it was. I can’t speak highly enough of him.’

In a statement, Keane said: ‘Ultimately, my roles with Villa and Ireland and combining my commitment to these have become too much. It isn’t fair to either Villa or Ireland, so I’ve made this decision.’

However, Villa and Ireland legend Paul McGrath told Ireland’s RTE Radio 1: ‘I was shocked when I heard that news because Villa are in a tough spot at the moment.

‘It’s not a good time for Roy to be leaving.’

Lambert added: ‘Roy informed me that, ultimately, the difficulty of combining both roles has prompted his decision, which I respect totally.’
