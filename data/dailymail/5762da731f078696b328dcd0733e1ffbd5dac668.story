Jimmy Bullard has revealed he has no intention of returning to reality TV show I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! despite a campaign to bring him back.

The former Fulham and Hull City midfielder was voted off the show on Monday after appearing to bully one of the other contestants.

But the 36-year-old revealed the incidents in question had been taken out of context by the programme's editors, leading to a campaign to reinstate Bullard.

Bullard admitted he was touched by the sentiment, but had no desire to return to the jungle.

He tweeted: 'Back at the Versace with @MattRichardson3 love the bring back jimmy campaign but don't you dare #dontbringjimmyback.'

The much-loved midfielder, who was known for his comic antics both on and off the pitch during his football career, was well-liked by his fellow contestants who were evidently sad at his elimination from the show.
