A classified ad in a Texas newspaper appears to show a scorned wife wreaking revenge on her cheating husband and his pregnant mistress.

The passive aggressive listing from Toldeo Bend congratulates Shara Cormier and Patrick Brown on the news they are to have a baby, signed with love by his wife, Timeshia.

The cutting take down reads, ‘I would like to say congratulations to Shara Cormier and Patrick Brown. They are expecting a baby. Hope you both are really in love and I hope it works out. Always, Patrick’s wife, Timeshia Brown.’

Angry: This is the newspaper advertisement that names and shames Patrick Brown and Shara Cormier for their alleged affair by the scorned wife of Patrick

While it is not clear when this advertisement was published or how much it cost, the story was shared on reddit on Monday after apparently being posted on Facebook.

Relatives and work colleagues of a Shara Cormier who lives in Sabine County Texas declined to comment on the advertisement.

The Facebook page of Cormier reveals she is friends with a Patrick Brown who lives in the same town, but unfortunately there is no trace of the wronged woman, Timeshia.
