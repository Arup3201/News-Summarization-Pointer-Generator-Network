Yohan Blake's miserable season continued as he pulled up 40 metres from the line and watched three men dip under 10 seconds in a  dramatic 100metres at Hampden Park.

The Beast, the second quickest man in history, claimed it was ‘just cramp’, but his injury looked far worse as he crumpled in a heap and had to leave the track in a wheelchair.

The Jamaican has attracted criticism for skipping this summer’s Commonwealth Games and  running on the lucrative Diamond League circuit after missing most of last season with injury. But his participation in next week’s London Anniversary Games is now in serious doubt, too.

After Blake crashed out, his compatriot Nickel Ashmeade won in 9.97sec. Michael Rodgers of the USA clocked the same time in second place, with Jamaica’s Nesta Carter third in 9.98sec.

Ashmeade also laid down a significant marker for his chances of winning Commonwealth gold in this stadium in just over two weeks’ time, particularly as Trinidad and Tobago’s Richard Thompson, who has run 9.82sec in 2014, could only finish sixth in 10.09sec.

Ashmeade said: ‘I’m really pleased with that. I felt good and the time speaks for itself.’ Britain’s James Dasaolu  comfortably beat the two men who have been selected ahead of him to represent England at the  Commonwealths, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and Richard Kilty, finishing fourth in 10.03sec.

The 26-year-old, the second fastest Briton of all time, has raced outdoors only twice this season after suffering a hamstring injury in February but has now surely secured his place at next month’s European Championships.

Chijindu Ujah, 20, may have run faster, posting 9.96sec last month, but Dasaolu has proved his fitness and consistency by clocking 10.03sec 10 days apart in Glasgow and Lausanne. Dasaolu said: ‘It’s only my second race of the season so I know I’ve got more to give and more to come, and I won’t be at the Commonwealths so it’s good to have a chance to race in this stadium.

‘For the Europeans it’s an unfortunate situation. If I get selected then I get selected, but if I don’t I’ll continue to race at a high level and against the best guys in the world.’

Heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson, meanwhile, continued her excellent season by finally landing the ‘monster’ leap she craved in her favourite event, the long jump. The 21-year-old added 11cm to her lifetime best to record 6.92m — the second furthest jump ever by a British athlete — and finish second behind Tianna Bartoletta of the USA, beating British record-holder Shara Proctor in the process.

Bad night at the office: Blake was taken away from the track in a wheelchair

Canadian Brianne Theisen-Eaton, Johnson-Thompson’s main rival for Commonwealth heptathlon gold, was in the stadium last night to watch her husband, decathlon world record-holder Ashton Eaton, compete in the 400m hurdles.

The Olympic champion posted a huge personal best of 48.69sec to finish second in an elite field, but Johnson-Thompson’s performance will surely have disrupted the  family’s celebrations. Johnson-Thompson said: ‘I’ve fallen in love with the stadium and I can’t wait for the Commonwealths.’

Last time Eilidh Child visited Hampden Park she saw Paul Hartley score a hat-trick as her beloved Hearts beat Hibernian 4-0 to reach the 2006 Scottish Cup final.

Not the way it should have gone: Blake looks dejected as he leaves the track

Eight years on, Child, Scotland’s team captain for the Commonwealth Games, was one of the main attractions herself, and backed up her star billing with a commanding victory in the 400m hurdles. Her time of 54.39sec was a season’s best and just 0.17sec off her Scottish national record, which Child feels she will have to ‘smash’ to win Commonwealth gold.

This vast stadium may have been less than a tenth full, but the roar that greeted Child driving off the final bend in first place gave a sense of what it might be like  during Games time. Last night, however, there were enough spare seats for Child to hear her father Ronnie’s ‘deep, kind of nervous voice’ down the back straight.

The 27-year-old said: ‘I’d like to think races like that bring out the best in me. When you have a bit more pressure it helps you raise your game so, hopefully, come the Games, I can do that again.’

Former world champion Dai Greene, however, pulled out of the men’s 400m hurdles, effectively ruling himself out of the European Championships. The British team will be selected on Monday and the Welshman has not matched the qualifying standard after a season disrupted by injury.

William Sharman equalled his personal best of 13.21sec to win the 110m hurdles, while six-time Paralympic champion David Weir judged his race perfectly to win the T54 1500m and Stef Reid won a $15,000 cheque for setting a new world record of 5.47m in the F44 long jump.
