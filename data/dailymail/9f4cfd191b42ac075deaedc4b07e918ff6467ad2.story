Fugitive accused cop killer Eric Frein is using diapers as he hides in the woods from up to 1,000 officers determined to track him down, police revealed Wednesday.

Now authorities are testing the soiled diapers to be absolutely sure the man they have cornered in woods in the Pocono Mountains is in fact Frein, who has now been on the run for 12 days.

'Diapers are in the sniper training that he received or self-taught,' Lt. Col. George Bivens of Pennsylvania State police told reporters at a briefing. 'That is one of the tactics that we know he has read about so he can stay in position for a longer period of time.'

Lethal: Frein, 31, has been described as a survivalist with an intense hatred of law enforcement. Now authorities are testing the soiled diapers they have found to be absolutely sure the man they have cornered in woods in the Pocono Mountains is Frein

'Diapers are in the sniper training that he received or self-taught,' Lt. Col. George Bivens of Pennsylvania State police told reporters at a briefing. 'That is one of the tactics that we know he has read about so he can stay in position for a longer period of time.'

Recovered: Police released photos of the green 2001 Jeep Cherokee Sport that Frein abandoned in the woods. Bivens would not comment on the suggestion that Frein specifically targeted one of the troopers before he attempted to flee. The car was registered to Frein's father Michael, a retired US Army major

 

Other items found in the woods south of Canadensis, Pennsylvania include packets of a rare type of Serbian cigarettes that Frein — a heavy-smoking war games enthusiast with a fascination for the former Yugoslav republic — is known to smoke.

King-sized, filtered Drina cigarette butts found in the area are also being tested for Frein's DNA, said Bivens.

Frein was active in Istocni Vuk, a group of military simulation enthusiasts who specialized in eastern European and Cold War conflicts. The name is Serbian for Eastern Wolf.

King-sized, filtered Drina cigarette butts found in the area are also being tested for Frein's DNA, said Bivens.

Cops are convinced they have Frein, 31, surrounded in a five square mile area of dense woods close to the home he shares with his parents — and despite failing to get their man yet, they are convinced they have him trapped.

'It's just a matter of time. We are on the right track,' he said.

Frein, who has taken survivalist training, has been on the lam since the shooting death of Trooper Bryon Dickson, 38, on September 12. Another trooper, Alex Douglass, 31, was critically injured during a shift change at the Blooming Grove Police Barracks in rural northeastern Pennsylvania.

Dickson, an ex-Marine with two young children, died on the scene. Douglass was able to crawl inside the barracks after being hit. He has undergone several surgeries. 'He continues to make steady progress,' said Bivens. 'He is still hospitalized and is in good spirits.

'Our troopers are visiting him regularly and he is in our thoughts.'

Bivens would not comment on the suggestion that Frein specifically targeted one of the troopers before he attempted to flee in a green 2001 Jeep Cherokee Sport registered to his father Michael, a retired US Army major.

But he failed to negotiate a junction and plowed into a swamp close to the barracks. Police say he then walked up to 20 miles through thick forest to get close to his home.

Bivens said cops and locals have made 'numerous' sightings of black-clad Frein in the woods, the most recent on Tuesday afternoon. But they have never been close enough — or made an absolutely 100 percent positive ID — to arrest or shoot him.

He confirmed that officers are authorized to use lethal force if Frein refuses to surrender.

'We have had sightings by law enforcement at a significant distance,' Bivens said. 'We are also getting reports back from members of the public.

'Based on the sightings and based on the items that we have found, we believe he is in this area.'

Bivens said there is evidence that Frein — who is known to hold a huge grudge against law enforcement — is taunting police by coming close to the perimeter of the search area but staying far enough away that they cannot get a clean shot at him.

''He has kept himself far enough away far enough way so no-one could get to him, but he has made himself visible.'

Bivens said officers have not fired any shots but they believe Frein has used the .308 rifle that he took from his parents' home. But he would not speculate whether the gunman had aimed at the cops who are searching for him, or whether he was hunting for food.

Catching Frein has been made more difficult by the lay of the land abutting the Delaware State Forest. 'It's extremely rugged,' said Bivens. 'it's rocky with very dense vegetation, ferns that are thigh-high, and mountain laurel.

'It's very difficult to establish a perimeter in the area,' he added.

He said the area contains numerous caves, crevasses that would give shelter. He said searchers had 'kicked out' numerous bears in their hunt for Frein.

Bevins refused to estimate a cost of the 12-day operation that has involved members of the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Federal Marshalls, local police and officers from neighboring New York and New Jersey.

'We have thrown a lot of resources and talented people at this,' he said.

He said police are still convinced that Frein only wants to kill cops and that members of the public are not likely targets, but he warned that civilians should take no chances and should stay out of the woods in the area

 And he said there is no evidence that anyone is helping the fugitive, but said that police would not hesitate to charge anyone who does. Frein's family, he said, has been cooperating in the inquiries.

He refused to answer questions as to whether the searchers have used pings from Frein's cellphone to help pinpoint the exact location of the alleged killer.

Tons of expensive hardware has been used in the search including helicopters and light planes, armored vehicles and 'The Rook,' a specialized 6-ton siege vehicle which allows officers to stay protected as they walk behind an armor-plated platform.

Protection: An armored truck at the perimeter of the search area. Much of the area has been on lockdown with some residents being unable to return to their homes during the manhunt

But Bivens said the thick canopy of leaves in the area has hampered the use of thermal imaging equipment.

Police believe that Frein had been planning the attack 'for months if not years.' A copy of the book, 'Sniper Training and Employment,' was found in his bedroom, during a search.

He had his hair cut into a Mohawk with shaved sides shortly before the attack on the barracks, in a move that police believe was part of his mental preparation.

Following the shootings, the FBI placed him on its 10 Most Wanted List. Its wanted poster describes him as 6'1", 165lb. State police said he changed his look, cutting his hair into a wide Mohawk as he prepared for his attack. He was also described as a heavy smoker.

 Police on Tuesday brought in an armored siege vehicle as the hunt for alleged cop killer Eric Frein moved into its 11th day.

'The Rook,' described by its manufacturers as 'six tons of pure responsive force' will allow officers to shield themselves as they hunt for Frein in dense woodland in northeast Pennsylvania.

The tracked vehicle was brought to a police staging post just south of the village of Canadensis where police are focusing their search.

The Rook is the latest piece of equipment to be brought in to try to find the missing man. Made by Ring Power, a company based in St. Augustine, Florida, the 13,000-pound tracked vehicle can punch holes in walls, remove cars and shield cops, and costs $245,000 and $445,000, depending on extras.
