Sheffield Eagles have signed former Bradford captain Jamie Langley from Hull KR.

The 30-year-old forward, who won every domestic honour during an 11-year spell with the Bulls, has signed a two-year contract with the Championship club and will also be part of their coaching team.

Sheffield head coach and chief executive Mark Aston said: 'We are delighted that Jamie has chosen to join us. I am looking forward to working with him both as a player and as a coach.

'We have a relatively young forward pack and his knowledge and experience will be invaluable to them.

'I am sure that Jamie will quickly become a fans' favourite and build on the reputation he has already gained from his experiences in both Super League and International rugby.'

Langley, who was not offered a new contract by Hull KR, said: 'It's a new challenge for me and I'm really excited to get going. When I was weighing up my options, I spoke to a few of the Sheffield lads and none of them had a bad word to say about the club.'

Langley, who won his only Great Britain cap against France in 2007, is looking forward to cutting his coaching teeth with the Eagles.

'I'm going to be playing first and foremost and I want to play on for as many years as possible,' he said.

'Helping on the coaching side of things is really appealing to me at this stage. I feel like I have a lot to offer having worked under some great coaches during my career. You learn little bits from each one and hopefully I can part with some of that wisdom myself.'
