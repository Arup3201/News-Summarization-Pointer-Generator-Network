Far right nationalist supporters of the Ukrainian Freedom Party held violent protests outside the nation's parliament building in Kiev to force legislators to recognise a World War II paramilitary force who fought both the Nazis and Soviet Union. 

Protesters threw stones and bottles at police guarding the nation's parliament building from attack. Young men armed with batons and metal chains gathered outside the building from early morning, breaking dozens of windows. 

Proceedings in the parliament building concluded early as a result of the disorder, although deputies managed some anti-corruption legislation in advance of parliamentary elections on October 26.

However, some of the protesters covered their faces with balaclavas during the march which soon turned violent 

Zoryan Shkiryak, aid to the Ukrainian interior minster said: 'This is a provocative action directed on destabilisation of the situation in Ukraine.'

Members of the nationalist Svoboda party held a rally near the parliament building asking for special status to be granted to the World War II nationalist force called the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). 

The Svoboda party denied its people were responsible for the violence. 

Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko managed to pass laws creating an anti-corruption bureau to fight graft as well as new restrictions to counter money laundering.  

Parliament also approved a new defense minister — former National Guard head Stepan Poltorak — a pressing priority as Ukraine still faces daily clashes with pro-Russian separatists in its industrial eastern regions.

A cease-fire has been in place since early September but violations are reported daily. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Tuesday their positions had come under rocket fire more than 30 times in the last 24 hours.

Security spokesman Col. Andrei Lysenko said seven servicemen in the east had been killed over the same time period, six of them by mines.

Much of the fighting in the east has focused on the government-held airport in the main rebel-held city of Donetsk. A rebel commander leading that assault, who identifies himself only by the nom de guerre Givi, said 27 of his fighters have been killed in the last three weeks while fighting for the airport.

Protesters threw fireworks and smoke bombs amid tense scene outside the Ukrainian Parliament building in Kiev 

Thousands of demonstrators, some with black and red flags of the Ukrainian far right clashed with massed ranks of police 

At least one of the riot police, top left, deployed pepper spray against the protesters while many brandished batons 

Although protesters themselves also used pepper spray against the police as scenes turned increasingly violent
