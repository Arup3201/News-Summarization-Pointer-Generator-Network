An elephant which appeared in Oliver Stone's epic movie Alexander has been killed by poachers in Thailand.. 

The 50-year-old elephant was poisoned by poachers who then sawed-off its tusks at the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace. 

As well as appearing in the movie starring Colin Farrell and Angelina Jolie the elephant named Klao was found dead yesterday at the nature reserve. 

The elephant was found on Friday at the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace after it was attacked by ivory poachers

The elephant was worth £70,000 according to local media reports. 

The Bangkok Post reported that Thai police arrested one man who is believed to be a drug addict in connection with the crime. 

They found poisoned bananas at the scene which were used to kill the beast before the one metre long tusks were removed. 

Police believe that the poaching gang were amateurs as they failed to remove all of the tusk. It is understood they used an electric power saw to cut through the ivory. 

The facility's manager Laithongrian Meephan admitted that the animal was probably poisoned before it was mutilated. 

He said the centre breeds and trains elephants and also acts as a retirement home for the animals who are revered in Thai culture. 

Although the country is also a major transport hub and destination for the illegal trade. 

Elephants are revered in Thai culture and animals from the sanctuary - including Klao - are regularly used in parades and festivals honouring the country's royal family as well as being used for film and TV work

Mr Meephan confirmed that Klao had also been used in parades celebrating the Thai royal family. 

He has also trained elephants for martial arts star Jackie Chan. 

The wildlife sanctuary is popular with tourists and guests even have the opportunity to hire an elephant to explore the countryside. 

Travellers pay £700 to stay at the sanctuary where the get the opportunity to care for an elephant and ride it into a river.  

Mr Meepan is the world's largest owner of elephants and has introduced a highly successful breeding programme at this centre.  

Wildlife trade monitoring group TRAFFIC said: 'Thailand has the unenviable reputation as home to one of the world's largest unregulated ivory markets.' 

Elephants are the de facto national animal and were once featured on the Thai flag. 

TRAFFIC estimates that Thailand has a population of 2,500 to 3,200 Asian elephants in the wild, and cites government statistics that another 4,169 were held in captivity in 2012.

Their numbers have decreased over recent decades and expanding human settlements have shrunk their natural habitat. The beasts once were used overwhelmingly for logging, but deforestation and a consequent ban on most logging has led to many elephants now being used as tourist attractions.

TRAFFIC said one reason that Thailand is a major smuggling point for ivory poached from African elephants is that a 75-year-old law permits the legal trade of ivory from domesticated Asian elephants inside Thailand, though the origin of retail ivory is seldom checked.

'Monitoring of Bangkok's domestic ivory market by TRAFFIC reveals a near trebling of the number of ivory items for sale in the past 18 months and a steep rise in the number of retail outlets selling ivory in Thailand's capital city,' it said.

The group said that at least 20,000 African elephants were killed in 2013 to meet the heavy demand for ivory from Asia, and more than 13 tons of African elephant ivory have been seized inside, or headed to, Thailand since 2008.

Staff at the Elephant Palace believe that poachers poisoned the beast before hacking-off its tasks
