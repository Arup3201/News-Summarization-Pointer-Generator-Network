Herculean: David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. He has portrayed the Belgian detective since 1989 and wishes to film all of his adventures penned by Agatha Christie

Agatha Christie could not stand Hercule Poirot.

The little Belgian detective with the waxed moustaches brought her fame and wealth, but she found him ‘insufferable’.

The actor David Suchet, luckily for us, can’t get enough of the character.

He has been playing Poirot since 1989, starting with 50-minute adaptations of short stories — Christie was endlessly inventive, and wrote more than 30 novels and 50 short tales featuring the pompous little sleuth with the egg-shaped head.

Suchet has made no secret of his ambition to star as Poirot in all the stories and the character has come to define his career.

Last night, the 13th season of Agatha Christie’s Poirot (ITV) opened with one of her last crime riddles, Elephants Can Remember.

It was not one of her better plots — the twist involves identical twins, a trick that was outlawed way back in 1929 when avid detective story fan Monsignor Ronald Knox published the Ten Commandments Of Crime (they included: no Chinamen, only one secret passage per novel, and definitely no cheating with twins).

Frankly, Elephants Can Remember isn’t one of the Crime Queen’s better titles, either. Most things can remember, apart from goldfish.

A cleverer title was hidden in the excellent script by Nick Dear: a retired copper relayed some ancient gossip to Poirot and reminded him, ‘Old sins have long shadows.’

But the elephant theme gave the set designers an excuse for extra fun. Among the glorious clutter of Thirties fabrics and props, from the garish rose wallpaper, to the gold tracery on the teacups, someone had placed an ivory monstrosity on Poirot’s windowsill: a tusk carved into a procession of elephants.

Poirot was as riotously egotistical as ever. Suchet’s genius is that he can deliver everything Christie found so exasperating, without becoming a caricature — he minces, he trots, he fusses, he talks endlessly of himself in the third person.

Partners against crime: Suchet with Zoe Wanamaker as lady sleuth Ariadne Oliver

‘If Poirot can be of any assistance he comes at once, toute suite,’ he said.

Zoe Wanamaker, as the lady detective Ariadne Oliver, worked hard to match him.

She has turned the original character, a bumbling scatterbrain who eats apples by the bagful in her bathtub, into a ghastly snob who investigates murders like a prefect at a girls’ boarding school who suspects the third formers of smuggling cherry brandy into the dorms.

It’s a clever device — she makes Poirot seem charming by comparison. And she gets results, sniffing out murder most foul in rural Sussex.

Fearful symmetry: Operation Snow Tiger followed the plight of the majestic Siberian tiger

As one old scandal-monger tells her: ‘In this part of the world, one either hunts or has affairs.’

Affairs would be out of the question in eastern Siberia, where blizzards blow for weeks and the temperature often falls below minus 30c.

Love of wildlife: Liz Bonnin's enthusiasm for the beautiful creatures was infectious

But hunting can be rewarding, when the quarry is tigers. Presenter Liz Bonnin, a former wildlife biologist who studied Bengal tigers in Nepal, brought real passion to Operation Snow Tiger (BBC2) last night, on the trail of the most magnificent predators on Earth.

Fewer than 350 Siberian tigers survive in the wild. More scientists have gone into space than have seen the animal in its natural habitat.

‘The Siberian tiger stands a very real risk of becoming extinct,’ she warned.

And film of the tigers was brief in this first of two episodes. Most of it came from hidden cameras in the forests north of Vladivostok, amid snow-scenes and ravishing scenery that looked like a real-world Narnia.

But Bonnin’s excitement when the camera traps caught images of tigers was palpable. She squealed, gasped and shouted when a fleeting image ghosted across the frame.

And she was determined to match the Russian scientists for stamina and hardihood, whether that was yomping through the snowdrifts, fighting to haul vehicles over the icy roads, or swigging Tigroff vodka.

She was pop-eyed with horror after downing a shot of the fiery liquid. ‘How do you say “that’s strong” in Russian?’ she croaked.

With so little footage of the tigers, there was inevitably some padding. But Bonnin’s genuine enthusiasm made every moment watchable.
