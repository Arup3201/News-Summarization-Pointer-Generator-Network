After being eliminated from the FA Cup at the hands of Bradford City in January, Chelsea's players have a rare weekend off before returning to action in the Champions League against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday.

And midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who returned to action after a hamstring problem in the 1-0 win against Everton on Wednesday as 70th minute substitute, appears to be using the extra time to enjoy some moments with his family.

His pregnant partner Daniella Semaan, uploaded an image on Instagram with the caption '#life' alongside their two children.

Fabregas will hope he can return to Jose Mourinho's starting line-up for the first leg of the last 16 clash against PSG in France next week.

Chelsea are one of the favourites to progress to the latter stages of Europe's most prestigious club competition and fans will hope that Fabregas, who has been inspirational for Chelsea since arriving at the club, has overcome his injury problems for the second half of the season.

After playing PSG, Premier League leaders Chelsea will resume their domestic campaign at home to Burnley.
