The audience sat transfixed as the beautiful ballerina and her handsome prince danced with extraordinary chemistry during the closing scenes of The Nutcracker.

What the cheering Royal Opera House crowd didn’t know, however, was that the classic Tchaikovsky fairytale they just witnessed concealed a real-life secret – the most romantic of marriage proposals.

It came as Clara, danced by Royal Ballet First Artist Leanne Cope, was asked for directions in the Land Of Sweets by the Nutcracker Prince, her childhood sweetheart Paul Kay.

Romance: They had performed their Nutcracker duet dozens of times - but Paul added a secret twist one night

It was a duet they had performed together dozens of times and required him to hand her a note.

Only now – unbeknown to either Miss Cope or the audience – the note read: ‘Will you marry me?’

As she theatrically perused the words, her professionalism never faltered. Instead, she merely pointed and hurried off stage, as the storyline demanded.

Moments later, as the curtain fell and enchanted ballet fans left the theatre, soloist Paul approached her backstage in front of the entire troupe. He dropped to one knee, presented her with a ring and popped the question verbally.

Miss Cope said ‘yes’ and yesterday the proposal culminated in a spring wedding – the first of five female dancers with the company planning to tie the knot this year.

‘I was really surprised,’ she said.

‘Luckily, I was supposed to point the Nutcracker Prince in the right direction and run off stage.

Dancing bride: Leanne, as Clara in The Nutcracker, is usually handed a note asking for directions to the Land Of Sweets during her duet with Paul. But she was left stunned one night when it in fact read: 'Will you marry me?'

'Paul had asked the stage manager for permission to switch the note. But the only people who knew were my mum and dad in the audience, as Paul had rung them to ask their permission to marry me.’

A spokesman for the Royal Ballet said: ‘As you might imagine, Leanne was somewhat taken aback on stage.

‘But as this happened right at the end of the performance, she at least didn’t have to perform another solo while thinking about her response.’

Among the first to congratulate the 
couple after the proposal was Tony Hall, then chief executive of the 
Royal Opera House and now Director- General of the BBC.

He described the on-set proposal as ‘the most romantic performance the main stage has ever seen.’

Yesterday, the couple married at the Roman Baths in Bath where Miss Cope’s stonemason grandfather had worked on the building’s restoration in the 1970s.

Now both aged 30, they first met two decades ago after finishing joint first in a children’s dancing competition. But it was not until they began training at the Royal Ballet School as teenagers that they began dating.

Their performances in The Nutcracker – which has been staged at Covent Garden every Christmas for 30 years – was described by one  captivated critic as having ‘a curving, almost delirious freedom in the upper body’.

Leanne has played numerous roles in the Royal Ballet and has built a particularly strong relationship with Artist In Residence Liam Scarlett, who has described her as having ‘a presence on stage like no other’.

Paul has a similarly impressive repertoire, with roles as varied  as Kolia in Chopin’s A Month In  The Country, Puck in The Dream ballet and Puss-in-Boots in  Sleeping Beauty.

The four other ballerina brides walking down the aisle this year are Itziar Mendizabal, Nathalie Harrison, Hayley Forskitt and Sabina Westcombe. Miss Forskitt is marrying another Royal Ballet dancer, Brian Maloney. 

All five women are featured in a photoshoot for the current edition of Conde Nast Brides magazine.
