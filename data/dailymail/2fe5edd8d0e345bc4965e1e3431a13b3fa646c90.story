Kevin Gifford has been banned from whistling after five residents complained that he woke them up

Kevin Gifford starts each working day with a spring in his step and a tune in his head as he completes his morning milk-round.

But the cheerful father of three has been told to pipe down by his employers after five residents on his delivery route of around 340 houses complained about his whistling.

Dairy bosses have issued Mr Gifford with a formal warning to curb the habit – a decision he condemned yesterday.

Mr Gifford, who delivers to homes in Leicester, said: ‘A whistling milkman is part of British life but they want to stop it. It’s madness.’

He told the Sun newspaper: ‘I think they were claiming breaching the peace or something ridiculous. They say I woke them up.

‘They should just roll over and go back to sleep, but these people decided to phone the dairy.

‘Are they going to complain about the birds singing as well? They make more noise than I do.’

Mr Gifford, 52, listens to songs such as the hit 500 Miles by The Proclaimers on his headphones to perk himself up in the morning.

He added: ‘If I know the words I sing and if I don’t, I whistle.

‘I think I cheer people up because I’m not very good at singing – I won’t be going on X Factor, that’s for sure.

‘Lots of my customers love it. One lady came out of her house at 4.30am to say she thought it was wonderful, but I guess another tradition is getting a kicking.’

Mr Gifford has been told that he can resume singing and whistling after 8am, when his round is finished.

‘All the other milkmen think it’s stupid. I just think it’s a storm in a teacup,’ he said.

‘When I was a kid the binman, the postman and everybody made a noise and nobody complained.

‘I’m
always in a good mood in the morning. We go out in the snow, wind and 
rain — what’s the point of being miserable? You’ve got to do your job.’

Bosses Kirby and West confirmed the milkman had been disciplined following the complaints

Bosses at Kirby & West Dairy confirmed that Mr Gifford had been disciplined but insisted he had not been threatened with the sack.

Kelvin Young, who is the dairy’s general manager, said: ‘Kevin was asked to reduce the noise.

‘Unfortunately he didn’t heed those warnings and we were left with no choice. I believe we were fair.’

According to Mr Gifford’s Facebook site his favourite songs include God Save the Queen by the Sex Pistols, Live and Let Die by Paul McCartney and Wings, Love to Love You Baby by Donna Summer and King Creole by Elvis Presley.

He has an eclectic music taste and says his favourite artists include Abba, Beyonce, Fleetwood Mac, Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash, The Jam and Lady Gaga.
