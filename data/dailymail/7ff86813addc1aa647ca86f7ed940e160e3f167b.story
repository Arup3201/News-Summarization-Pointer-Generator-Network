Price: £69.99 / $106(RRP)

Gaming headsets can be costly. And at £69.99, the Ear Force PX22 comes in at the cheaper end of the spectrum.

Thankfully, although aesthetically it's not the prettiest headset out there, it packs a solid punch in the sound department.

Take its engine room, the 50mm speakers coupled with comfortable memory foam ear cushions to block out sound. Or the inline amp, that allows you to adjust bass and treble levels.

Sound of success: However, few will warm to the PX22's looks and the memory foam is not particularly comfy

That's not forgetting independent volume controls for chat and the ability to connect your mobile phone and take calls and stream music while playing.

There's no Dolby Surround found in higher-end models, but it's USB-powered, so there is no need for batteries and features Dynamic Chat Boost, that automatically raises chat volume during more intense gaming battles.

There's no denying then, that the PX22 sounds like a bit of bargain, packing plenty of low-end thump, crisp pitches and minimal distortion.

Sadly, all this performance comes at the expense of its design. They're too light, feel flimsy and give the impression they'd break easily.

The memory foam, too, looks rather 'stuck on' compared with more top-end models, such as the XP Seven. 

This is likely to not bother many looking to use the headset at home, however, given the PX22's mobile phone compatibility, it's a shame stave off more multi-purpose use.

With all gaming headsets, comfort is key. And while the memory foam and adjustable band fits snugly around many-a-head, most will find the need to give their ears a breather every hour or so.

Upgrade: For more serious gamers, the XP Seven headset, retailing for around £180 ($279), is the way to go

However, take nothing away from the PX22. It's a fine piece of kit and a worthy entry-level offering for those taking their first steps into more immersive gaming.

The PX22 and XP Seven are available from Amazon, Lime and GAME.
