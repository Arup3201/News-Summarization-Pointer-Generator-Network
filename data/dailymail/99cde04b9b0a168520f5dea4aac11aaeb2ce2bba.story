Mr Palmer also said the senator had to answer questions about when she was receiving a disability pension.

Senator Lambie has denied there are any problems with payments she received.

She's spent the weekend at home in Tasmania considering her position and taking advice.

A spokesman told AAP that she would make a final decision after meeting Mr Williams in Canberra on Monday.

'When you have somebody very powerful that has a lot of money you have to cover all your bases and make sure that if they're going to come at you for whatever reason that you have everything covered,' Senator Lambie said.

'I have to look after the best interests of Tasmanians and make sure that everything's covered.'
