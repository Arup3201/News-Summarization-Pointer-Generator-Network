The RAF cannot refuel its new £650million spy planes in mid-air, it has been revealed.

In a fresh humiliation for the Ministry of Defence, it emerged that Britain must rely on other nations to fill up the RC-135 Rivet Joint aircraft once it is in the skies.

Military analysts warned that crucial reconnaissance missions could be jeopardised by the UK's failure to act independently.

But the Ministry of Defence said fuel efficient engines allow the plane to operate for longer while avoiding the spiralling costs and delays involved in converting it.

Ministers bought three second-hand Rivet Joints from the U.S. Air Force in March 2010 to eavesdrop on enemy communications.

Renamed the Airseeker by the RAF, the 
vintage jets are being introduced to replace the Nimrod surveillance 
planes axed in 2011 after one blew up over Afghanistan, killing all 14 
men on board.

The aircraft, due to enter service in 2014, are currently being fitted with state-of-the-art spying equipment to gather intelligence and intercept communications including radar and voice transmissions.

But the RAF has been forced to admit that it will only be able to fuel the planes while they are stationary on the ground - making it impossible for them to carry out airborne missions of more than 12 hours without begging allies for help.

The problem is that the U.S. Air Force and other Nato countries use a different method of air-to-air refuelling than the RAF.

The U.S. uses a boom refuelling system so a tanker aircraft would fly ahead of the Rivet Joint and pass back a rigid, hollow pipe which fits into its tank so fuel can be pumped into it - similar to how a car would be filled up at a petrol station.

The Airseeker can hold a crew of 27 including three pilots, two navigators and 22 rear crew.

It weighs 146 tonnes when fully loaded and is 136ft long with a 130ft wingspan.

With a top speed of 580mph, it has a range of 3,450 miles and can hit a maximum altitude of 50,000ft.

The MoD expects them to be fully operational by 2014.

The RAF, on the other hand, refuels mid-air using a method called 'probe and drogue'. British military tankers trail behind them a shuttlecock-shaped basket known as a 'drogue' on the end of a hose. The plane being refuelled then places a 7-inch probe into this to fill up its tank.

The tankers carry 100,000 litres of fuel which is passed to other planes at 5,000 litres a minute - 125 times the speed of garage forecourt pumps.

An ex-RAF officer said: 'It seems to be a terrible blunder. The MoD attitude is we don't need to refuel it inflight but that's absolute rubbish.

'For a lot of missions, maybe you don't. But if we need to, we can't.

'We'd have to beg the U.S. or the French for help and if they don't agree with what we're doing they could turn around and say, "No, we won't".

'We are losing a sovereign strategic asset and that is a dangerous position to be in.'

Critics claim the MoD replaced the Nimrod with Rivet Joint jets because the cash-strapped department could not stretch to buying modern aircraft.

Nimrod planes used to be used for surveillance purposes but they had to be ditched by the MoD due to safety concerns

The spy planes are being converted from KC-135 Stratotankers, built in 1964, in Greenville, Texas.

Once delivered they will be operated by 51 Squadron at RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire,

RAF sources said the Rivet Joint  can fly for up to ten hours without refuelling so commanders would rarely need to rely on their allies for assistance.

But they said fitting the spy plane with RAF-friendly mid-air refuelling capabilities would have seen costs spiral 'astronomically' and delay the introduction of the aircraft for several years.

One officer said: 'This is not the gold-standard but that was not possible in the time frame we wanted to have the planes in operation.

'Would we like to be able to refuel independently? Yes. Is it essential? No.'

It is not the first refuelling glitch to hit the RAF. Last year, the MoD faced criticism after it emerged its new £10.5billion refuelling planes did not work on British fighter jets.

Tests revealed that the new fleet of giant Voyager tankers leaked fuel when trying to fill up RAF Tornados and Typhoons mid-flight.

Engineers discovered 'problems' with the connecting pipes which join the aircraft so fuel can be pumped to the warplanes.

Defence sources said the MoD had opted to buy the aircraft 'off the shelf' to ensure the RAF had the operational intelligence and surveillance capability in service more swiftly.

An MoD spokesman said: 'Airseeker will shortly provide the RAF with a vital surveillance and intelligence capability.

'Air-to-air refuelling is not essential for the aircraft as Airseeker's new fuel efficient engines allow it to operate for longer. Where required, it can be refuelled by the UK's Nato allies and the US.'
