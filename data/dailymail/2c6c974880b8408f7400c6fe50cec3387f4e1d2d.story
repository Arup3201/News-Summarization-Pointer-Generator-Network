They may be remembered as a fierce tribe of headhunters who would decorate their homes with the severed skulls of their enemies.

But these incredible pictures of the Naga community taking part in fishing trips, preparing dinner and cooking raw opium, paints the tribe in a new light. 

Naga men are seen wading through an icy creek and warming themselves by the fire after catching fish on a hunting trip between Donhe and Lahe township in the Naga Self-Administered Zone in northwest Myanmar. 

Around 120,000 people live in the zone in Sagaing Division where they survive mainly by subsistence farming and hunting.

But cultural practices are changing as the younger men now wear trousers rather than traditional loincloths and one can even be seen using a walkie-talkie as there is no phone reception in the area.

One man who claims to be 100 years old has been photographed wearing a hat adorned with wild boar tusks in Donhe township, but this type of traditional dress is now usually restricted to festivals.

The Naga speak dozens of languages and many of those in Myanmar use Burmese as a lingua franca, but many Naga communities remain impoverished and inaccessible by road. 

Traditionally, the Naga fish with nets or by crushing up poisonous leaves to kill fish that float to the surface to be collected but now  some use homemade explosive they throw in rivers.

They had relatively little or no contact with the outside world, including that of greater India, until British colonisation of the area in the nineteenth century.

Members of the community  prepare traditional dish including leaves from opium poppies as well as mustard, which the Naga plant in poppy fields because they say that gives it a better flavour. One man holds a walkie-talkie, used because there is no phone reception

Men smoke opium from traditional pipes made out of bamboo. The opium is harvested from poppy fields cultivated nearby and is mostly kept for local consumption, while some is traded for goods such as clothing or household items
