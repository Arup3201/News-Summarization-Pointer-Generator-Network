A vicious Pakistani husband hacked off his own wife's legs with an axe less than two months after they married, according to local media reports.

Muhammed Siddique was arguing with his second wife Memoona Bibi over 'domestic issues' when he launched the brutal attack last night in the town of Shahpur in Punjab, it was reported.

Bibi is thought to have started abusing and torturing his wife only a few days after they married in early March.

'Torture': Memoona Bibi is said to to have been torturing his wife Siddiq for weeks before the attack

In last night's alleged attackÂ Siddique first beat his wife with a stick before taking up his axe for the horrific amputation, according to the International Business Times.

Neighbours of the couple are said to have restrained Bibi and hand him over to the police. Mrs Bibi was rushed to hospital.
