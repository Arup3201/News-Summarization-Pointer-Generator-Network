An 18-year-old student who was high on 'molly' allegedly stole an ambulance and went on a 13-mile Halloween joyride, before crashing the vehicle and being Tasered by police.

Stefan Sortland is accused of stealing the Poyudre Valley Hospital ambulance as paramedics treated an intoxicated student for seizures at Colorado State University in the early hours of last Sunday.

He reportedly donned an EMT vest and drove to nearby Loveland, where he jumped a curb, crashed into a sign, went the wrong way and crossed a raised median on Highway 34 twice before stopping.

Police, who had tracked the ambulance using its on-board GPS system, discovered the vehicle in the middle of the highway with several doors open, front-end damage and fluid leaking.

They then spotted Sortland stood around 30 yards away, near Boyd Lake Road, wearing the vest and carrying a blanket, a cell phone and a box of Wheat Thins,  according to ABC 7.

After the teenager refused to obey their commands, officers used a Taser to subdue him, before handcuffing him and taking him to Loveland Police Department.

While in custody, Sortland, a sophomore at the university in Fort Collins, 'stood on a bench, kicked the wall, and masturbated', according to police reports.

He also told police his 'friends were dead, in heaven, and had committed suicide.' However, officers checked on the two people the teenager had referred to and found they were both fine.

Sortland later admitted that he had stolen the ambulance from the university's Academic Village campus at around 2am after taking 'molly' (Ecstasy) and cocaine at a Halloween concert, it is said.

He was transported to Larimer County Sheriff's Office the same day, where he allegedly attacked two deputies who were bringing him lunch in the jail's booking area.

He reportedly punched one of the men in the face, causing a concussion and facial swelling, while the second deputy suffered an abrasion and finger sprain during a scuffle with the suspect.

In a telephone conversation with police, Sortland's father said his son had no mental health issues but had seemed 'irrational' on the phone on Halloween, the news station reported.

Sortland has been charged with aggravated vehicle theft, obstructing EMS, reckless driving, hit-and-run, criminal mischief, attempted motor vehicle theft and unlawful possession of a controlled substance. He has also been handed criminal charges of assault for the jail incident.

His bond was reportedly set at $15,000 on Monday. He is due back at court on November 7.

The patient who was being treated at the university is said to be 'doing okay'.
