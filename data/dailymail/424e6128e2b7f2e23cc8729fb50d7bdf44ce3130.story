Today was officially the hottest day of the year with the mercury rising to a relatively balmy 15.5C in Gravesend in Kent, making it hotter than Rome.

What's more, we could see temperatures climbing even higher than this over the weekend, according to the Met Office.

The average temperature for March in the UK is 9.8C, but temperatures will reach almost double this over the coming days.

Ritual: Hares are seen boxing every year in the UK as they seek to impress females

The warmer conditions brought out sparring male hares, who quite literally box each other in a bid to win the affections of female hares, with the losers hopping off with broken hearts.

Hares are Britain's fastest land animal - able to run at speeds of 45mph – and they can throw a pretty fast punch, too.

They are clearly making the most of the sunshine – and forecasters say that temperatures are set to soar to 18C (64F).

For the first time this year it will be ice cream weather, as parts of Britain will be warmer than Greece. A high pressure system dragging in winds from the southwest means the mercury may climb to double the average March temperature.

Forecasts for Sunday put Athens at 10C (50F), Ibiza at 16C (61F) and Istanbul at 7C (45F).

The Met Office said: ‘Warmer, drier weather is on the way for parts of the country.

‘In the South high pressure will dominate, bringing dry weather for the weekend, with the best of the weather in the South East.’

Northwest England and Scotland, however, will be cloudy with patchy showers.

Spring officially starts on March 20, but there are already abundant signs that winter is over.

Daffodils and crocuses are in full bloom and spring blossom is on trees across the country. The warmer weather produced a glorious record crop of crocuses in a Berkshire meadow which are descended from flowers brought back to this country by King Richard the Lionheart and his Crusader knights.

Back in the depths of winter, the eight-acre field in the village of Inkpen is nothing special - even though it's a nature reserve founded by one of the wealthiest men of the last 100 years.

In March, however, it explodes into colour with the flowering of thousands of wild crocuses said to have originated from the reign of King Richard more than 800 years ago.

Temperatures reached 12C (54F) in Bournemouth, Dorset, on Wednesday, where people took advantage of clear skies to head to the seafront. The seven-mile promenade was busy with people enjoying the warm weather.

John Lee, forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: ‘The weather will be getting much better into the weekend. The south of England will be somewhat drier than we’ve  had recently.

‘High pressure is expected to dominate through the start of next week, with sunshine around and light winds.’

After the wettest winter in 250 years, flood water levels that have devastated large parts of the country are gradually easing, the Environment Agency said last night.

A severe flood warning for part of the Somerset Levels, in place since February 5, was downgraded by the agency on Wednesday after flood waters in the area dropped.

Just one severe flood warning remains in place, near Burrowbridge in Somerset.

A huge pumping operation continues, but drier weather means flood levels are expected to fall even further over the week.
