A type of rock that often contains diamonds has been found in Antarctica for the first time, hinting at mineral riches in the vast, icy continent where mining is banned.

Australian scientists are confident of finding the precious gems but none have been recovered yet and there is little prospect of a diamond rush as the continent is protected.

The team of researchers found kimberlite deposits around Mount Meredith, in the Prince Charles Mountains in East Antarctica.

A type of rock called kimberlite (pictured), which often contains diamonds has been found in Antarctica, hinting at mineral riches in the icy continent where mining is banned. No diamonds have been found yet, but if they are, they might look a little like this diamond crystal, found in South Africa, which is pictured on kimberlite

‘It would be very surprising if there weren't diamonds in these kimberlites,’ Greg Yaxley of the Australian National University in Canberra, who led the research, said.

Kimberlite is a rare rock where diamonds are often found, which is named after the South African town of Kimberley - the site of a late 19th-century diamond rush.

However, this does not mean that people will flocking to Antarctica to mine diamonds any time soon as it is not only forbiddingly cold and remote but also protected by a treaty that preserves the continent for scientific research and wildlife, from penguins to seals.

The 1991 environmental accord has banned mining for at least 50 years.

‘I don't think it's terribly practical that anyone could actually explore successfully and, personally, I hope that mining does not take place,’ Dr Yaxley said.

Others geologists doubted the find held much commercial value.

Dr Robert Larter, a British Antarctic Survey geophysicist, said: ‘It is important to note that the study does not report discovery of a commercially-viable deposit or even actual diamonds. What it reports is the discovery of rocks of the type that often host diamonds.’

Less than 10 per cent of the deposits of similar kimberlite are economically viable, said Teal Riley of the British Antarctic Survey.

‘It's a big leap from here to mining,’ he told Reuters.

The Antarctic Treaty is binding only on its 50 signatories, but it has the backing of major powers, including the United States and China. Many expect the ban on mining to be extended in 2041.

‘There is likely to be little opposition to an extension of this prohibition, despite the potential discovery of a new type of Antarctic "ice"’ Nature Communications, the journal which published the study, said in a statement.

But another expert said the future is not so clear.

Gold, platinum, copper, iron and coal have also been found in Antarctica and diamonds are already mined today in some of the world's colder reaches of northern Canada and Siberia.

Kevin Hughes, of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, said: ‘We do not know what the Treaty parties' views will be on mining after 2041 or what technologies might exist that could make extraction of Antarctic minerals economically viable.’

Dr Riley said there was a fine line between geological mapping and prospecting with an eye to mining.

Russia, the Ukraine and China, among other countries, have been more active in surveying Antarctica in recent years.

Demand for diamonds is likely to outpace supply in coming years as few new mines are being discovered to provide the newly wealthy in countries such as China with Western-style jewellery.

The last major find was Rio Tinto's Murowa mine in Zimbabwe in 1997.

Diamonds are formed under immense heat and pressure around 100 miles (160 km) below the earth’s surface in the molten rock of its mantle.

Millions of years later, they are brought to the surface in powerful eruptions and preserved in the distinctive igneous rock formations called kimberlites.

The kimberlite deposit is also confirmation of how continents drift.

The region of East Antarctica was once part of a continent known as Gondwanaland, connected to what is now Africa and India, which also have kimberlite.

People will flocking to Antarctica to mine diamonds any time soon as the continent is protected by a treaty that preserves it for scientific research and wildlife.
