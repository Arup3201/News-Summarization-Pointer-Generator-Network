Apple has confirmed a bug in its new iOS 8 has meant users cannot automatically sync their health data to the firm's new Health app.

The Health app is designed to allow users to easily see in one place all their health related data, and to share it with doctors, and works with a new software service called HealthKit.

However, the firm said it had stopped apps using the feature from being distributed until an undisclosed bug can be fixed.

The new Health app on iOS 8 features a dashboard (pictured) showing all the user's health and ﬁtness data. However, the firm was today forced to delay apps using the service from being distributed.

HealthKit is not an app but a back-end framework that allows third-party apps to sync with Apple's new and proprietary health tracking app, Health.

This lets users chart metrics like weight, sleep and calorie intake, and is available in the iOs update.

However, until apple fixes the bug, users will have to manually enter their data rather than syncing it form other apps. 

'We discovered a bug that prevents us from making HealthKit apps available on iOS 8 today,' it told the FT's Tim Bradshaw.

'We're working quickly to have the bug fixed in a software update and have HealthKit apps available by the end of the month.' 

Developer Brian Mueller of Carrot Fit said via Twitter that his app had been removed from the App Store because HealthKit wasn't ready for launch. 

Later he said the service wouldn't be ready for the rest of this week.

The Health app puts all heart rate, calories burned, blood sugar, and cholesterol information in one place, and blood type and allergy information can be accessed from the Lock Screen, in case of an emergency. 

The delay comes as Apple today launched iOS 8, a huge update for the iPhone and iPad software.

Apple's latest software features updated photo editing tools and time-lapse videos, sounds and location features in the Messages app, and an Interactive Notifications tool.

Design-wise, the software looks similar to iOS 7, with flat icons and menus.

The search function on Apple's Photos app has been improved to make it easier to find photos, based on location, dates, or album name.

The Messages app in iOS 8 now lets users capture sounds to send in conversations, including voice notes, ambient sounds and music.

The new Messages app also takes on Whatsapp by additionally letting users send videos, start group conversations and enable Do Not Disturb to hide group notifications until a later time.

Apple senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi speaks about the Apple HealthKit app at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco in June, when it was first revealed.

Elsewhere, users can send their location to friends, which appear on an interactive map, and send multiple photos and videos from the Camera Roll.

Apple announced HealthKit in June at its World World Wide developer's conference.

Tim Cook said in a recent interview with Charlie Rose that health care represented a 'wide open field to make some really profound contributions.'

'You can begin to take all of the data that's in all of your health apps and aggregate those,' he said when describing HealthKit. 

'You might elect just to use that yourself. You might elect to interact with your doctor on them.

Users can fine-tune edits, and the latest smart composition tools automatically straighten horizons, or crop the image.

There are also smart adjustments that modify the overall light and colour in a photo to balance exposure, brightness and contrast.

Apple has now added time-lapse video modes, accessible through the Record button on the Camera app.

MESSAGES

The Messages app in iOS 8 takes on Whatsapp by letting users capture sounds to send in conversations, including voice notes, ambient sounds or music.

To play these sounds, users can either press the Play button, or hold the device up to their ear and listen like a phone call.

The new Messages app additionally lets users send videos, start group conversations and enable Do Not Disturb to hide group notifications until a later time.

Elsewhere, users can send their location to friends, which appear on a interactive map, and send multiple photos and videos from the Camera Roll.

There is also a Snapchat-style self-destruct button for video messages. 

INTERACTIVE NOTIFICATIONS

One of the stand-out features mentioned by Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, at iOS 8's unveiling in June was the Interactive Notifications tool.

This feature let users reply to texts, emails, accept calendar invites, tweet and send Facebook messages straight from the notification banner.

This means they don't have to open the specific app, or leave the app they were already using. 

With iOS 8, pressing the Home button twice opens the multitasking menu.

Along the top, users will now see the faces of people they've recently talked to, and by swiping to the right, their favourite contacts. This means they can call or text these people with one tap.

And when contacts send calendar invites, for example, they can be added to the diary from the top of the screen.

QUICKTYPE

In iOS 8, Apple has added support for more third-party keyboards and improved its own keyboard to add predictive text.

As a user types, they'll see a choice of words or phrases the software thinks they will type next, based on past conversations and writing style.

The software can also distinguish between informal languages uses in the Messages app, for example, and more formal language when using the Mail app.

It also adjusts the style based on the person the user is communicating with, because their choice of words is likely more laid back with a spouse than with a boss.

FAMILY SHARING

With Family Sharing, up to six people in a family can share purchases from iTunes, iBooks and the App Store without sharing accounts.

This means family purchases can be paid with the same credit card, and a child's spending has to be approved from a parent's device.

Photos and family calendars can also be shared more easily, and everyone on the account can contribute photos to shared albums, for example.

HEALTH

The new Health app on iOS 8 features a dashboard showing all the user's health and ﬁtness data.

Apple has also created a tool for developers called HealthKit, which syncs other health and fitness apps together.

The Health app puts all heart rate, calories burned, blood sugar, and cholesterol information in one place, and blood type and allergy information can be accessed from the Lock Screen, in case of an emergency.

Apple has also improved its Spotlight tool, (pictured) which searches for files and information on the device, and the web.The app now considers the answer, and uses context to provide the most relevant choices

SPOTLIGHT

Apple has also improved its Spotlight tool, which searches for files and information on the device, and the web.

The tool now considers the answer, and uses context to provide the most relevant choices.

When searching for a person, item or term, a Wikipedia snippet will appear. The new Spotlight identifies hot topics, and knows what's trending.

And typing the name of a restaurant reveals the closest branch, including phone number and opening hours, for example, too.
