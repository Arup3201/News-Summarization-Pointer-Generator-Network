The daring dogs, many of which are rescues, were judged based on their ability to ride the waves, have fun and keep their paws on their surfboards.

Dozer's co-owner Gigi Bagapror said: 'A lot of sleeping, a lot of eating, and a lot of surfing, but it's really about having a lot of fun out on the waves.

'When he's out there he just smiles - he's always out there having a good time.

'It's all for a good cause, the Helen Woodward Animal Center. Dozer wants to help all his furry friends out there and give them the support they need.'
