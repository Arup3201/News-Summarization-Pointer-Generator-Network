The BBC handed out £26million in severance payoffs over the past 12 months, it admitted yesterday.

A year after it promised to get a grip on the spiralling costs of ‘golden goodbyes’, the corporation is still paying out huge sums to hundreds of departing staff.

The BBC refused to name the recipients, but in total, 12 of the BBC’s managers 
received payments totalling £2.8million – an average of more than 
£230,000 each – despite new director general Tony Hall, pictured, 
pledging in April 2013 to cap deals at £150,000.

Tory
 MP Stewart Jackson, who sits on the Commons public accounts committee 
which investigated the original payoff scandal, said the BBC ‘does not 
seem to have learned its lessons’.

The
 figures, published in the BBC’s annual report, reveal a total of 
£25.6million was given to 413 staff from April last year until the end 
of March. This included £3.6million handed to just 22 senior managers.

The
 report comes a year after the National Audit Office found the BBC paid 
departing staff £369million over eight years, including £61million to 
401 senior managers.

Last 
financial year’s payoff total was a significant fall on 2012/13, when 
£40million was handed to 793 staff, with senior managers receiving 
£5million.

In an internal 
review published alongside the report, Dame Fiona Reynolds, a BBC 
non-executive director, said ‘more needs to be done’ to clamp down.

The BBC said the 12 payoffs of more than £150,000 had been ‘in the pipeline’ before the cap came into effect in September.

A
 spokesman added: ‘Severance payments have declined since Tony Hall 
introduced a cap ... but like any organisation when long-standing 
members of staff are made redundant they are contractually entitled to  
payments. The cap means no longer can anyone receive more than 
£150,000.’

Cutting costs: The BBC  revealed that it has slashed £6million from the amount paid to its top stars. Susanna Reid (pictured second from left with her Good Morning Britain co-presenters) left the BBC for ITV in April, where she reportedly receives a £400,000 a year salary

Big earners: The BBC has been criticised for the amount it spends on stars such as Jeremy Clarkson and Graham Norton, but today announced its talent bill has been cut from £200m to £194m in the past year

As the report was published yesterday, the BBC 
Trust, the corporation's governing body, said there had been successes, 
highlighting shows like Call The Midwife and Rev, but acting chairman 
Diane Coyle added: 'There have also been some high-profile failures.

'The
 BBC’s Digital Media Initiative project was closed at a cost of nearly 
£100 million. And there was the controversy surrounding past severance 
payments...

'Both
 of these episodes involved significant sums of public money and saw the
 BBC falling well short of what licence fee-payers expect.'

Excessive 
payouts came under scrutiny last year when it emerged that deputy 
director-general Mark Byford left the BBC with a total payout of 
£949,000 and former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson was given 
£680,000.

George
 Entwistle took £470,000 when he resigned as director-general in the 
wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal after being in the role for just 54 
days, with 150 managers between them receiving £25 million in pay-offs.

The
 Commons Public Accounts Committee was critical of the payments in a 
report late last year, with the chairman saying the BBC had 'put its 
reputation at risk'.

The report also showed the amount paid to the broadcaster’s top stars was slashed by more than £6 million last year.

The corporation had been heavily criticised for the amount it pays its top talent, with presenters including Jeremy Clarkson and Graham Norton reportedly among its biggest earners.

In its annual report for 2013/14, the BBC said talent pay was slashed by more than £6 million, bringing a 15 per cent fall in its talent bill since 2009.

The number of senior managers was cut by 8 per cent last year, while the number of top earners on salaries of more than £100,000 fell for the fourth consecutive year. 

High salary: Departures, such as that of former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman who left his post in June will help trim the wage bill in this financial year

Further high profile departures, such as that of former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman - thought to have been on a salary of more than £500,000 a year - who left his post in June will help trim the wage bill in this financial year.

In addition to the falling talent bill, Lord Hall is set to announce that the BBC is 'delivering on its commitments', with popular shows such as Sherlock and Happy Valley, despite a 26 per cent reduction in funds available for BBC services over six years.

Among the 150 BBC executives thought to have received huge pay-offs from the corporation is Peter Fincham.

The former BBC1 controller who walked away in 2007 with £500,000 after resigning over the so-called Crowngate scandal.

Mr Fincham, who is now ITV director of TV, wrongly told the Press at a screening that the Queen walked out of a photoshoot featured in a royal documentary ‘in a huff’.

It later emerged that a promotional trailer for the programme had been misleadingly edited and that his account was untrue.

Mark Byford, the former deputy director general of the BBC, received a controversial pay-off package that saw him leave the BBC in 2011 with £949,000. 

George Entwistle took £470,000 when he resigned as director-general in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal after being in the role for just 54 days. 

Senior BBC managers received a total of £25milion in severance deals between 2009 and 2012, and nearly £3million was paid over and above what they were entitled to in their contracts in the six years to 2012, a National Audit Office report found.

It follows a licence fee freeze and new commitments given to the BBC such as part-funding the roll-out of superfast broadband, the corporation will say.

Lord Hall will also pledge a 4 per cent increase in spending on content and delivery over the next three years.

The BBC said it is 'delivering on its commitments', with popular shows such as Sherlock and Happy Valley, despite an effective 26 per cent reduction in funds available for BBC services over six years following a licence fee freeze and new commitments given to the BBC such as part-funding the superfast broadband roll-out.

BBC director-general Tony Hall is also pledging a 4 per cent increase in spending on content and delivery over the next three years.

Last week BBC News announced plans to axe 415 posts to save £48 million a year by 2016/17. The cuts will be offset by around 195 new roles, meaning a net reduction of 220 jobs.

The BBC annual report shows that a total £3.62 million was made in severance payments to 22 senior management staff in 2013/14. That was down on the £5.06 million for 2012/13.

Severance payments to all staff, including senior managers, was £25.6 million in 2013/14 compared with £40.2 million in 2012/13.

The report also showed that 'audience appreciation' has decreased for BBC1, BBC2, BBC3 and BBC4.

Ms Coyle said that the BBC had 'found its feet' after a 'bruising period'.

She added: 'The BBC executive has made good progress on its priorities for the past 12 months, and we are expecting further progress in the next year on areas including... the variety and originality of programmes, value for money and serving an increasingly diverse UK.'

Audience appreciation of BBC television has fallen slightly for the first time in a number of years, to 82.1 per cent.

The BBC defended the fall at a press conference, saying that it was because it had done so well the previous year with the London Olympics, the European Championship and the Diamond Jubilee.

Danny Cohen, director of television, added: 'There's no doubt if you take 26 per cent of your spending out, you are going to have an impact on how people feel about things.

'But I feel very, very confident in the quality of what we are doing, in its distinctiveness, and I feel very confident that the overall appreciation of our channels will grow.' 

Among the stars to leave the corporation in the last year was BBC Breakfast presenter Susanna Reid, who left to join ITV's Good Morning Britain. 

Reid, who became a household name when she reached the final of last year's Strictly Come Dancing, left the BBC in April for an opportunity she 'couldn't turn down', which reportedly netted her a £400,000 a year salary.

Earlier this month the BBC Trust ordered a review into how the corporation pays its stars but said it will not publish details of 'individual talent deals'.

A planned strike by BBC staff scheduled for the first day of the Commonwealth Games on Wednesday was called off last week.

The BBC has announced plans to axe 415 posts to save £48 million a year by 2016/17. The cuts will be offset by around 195 new roles, meaning a net reduction of 220 jobs.
