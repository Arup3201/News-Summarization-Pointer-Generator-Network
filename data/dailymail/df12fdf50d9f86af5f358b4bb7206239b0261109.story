Good news: A doctor has found the cure for a mysterious and debilitating condition which afflicted people in a rural part of Sweden with the need to urinate up to 15 litres a day

A doctor has found the cure for a mysterious and debilitating condition which afflicted people in a rural part of Sweden with the need to urinate up to 15 litres a day.  

Since the early 1800s, many in Värmland, near the Norwegian border, have been struck down by the disease as they reached their teens.

It was only when Dr Johan Jendle, a Swedish doctor at Karlstad Hospital, spotted that all sufferers were related, that he identified the cause as a hitherto unknown genetic variant of Diabetes Insipidus.

'Normal people urinate 1.5 litres per day', Dr Jendle told Nya Wermlands-Tidningen, a local paper.

'But those who suffer from Diabetes Insipidus can urinate 15 litres per day, which needing to drink a corresponding amount.'

'Sufferers often find that they have to be within sight of a toilet, and need easy access to water constantly', he added.

Jendle tracked down all living members of the family, now scattered throughout Sweden, and managed to trace the disease back to a genetic mutation that happened some time in the 1800s.

'About half of all children in the family have suffered to a greater or lesser extent', he said.

'Now we can use a simple blood test to find out if a person carrying the disease,  and then treat it when the symptoms occur.'

The condition is not usually thought of as genetic, and is usually caused by damage to the pituitary gland, either as the result of a tumour, or of a violent assault.

The pituitary gland, among other things, produces the urinary hormone, vasopressin.

The condition, which can be lethal in extreme cases, can be treated with hormone supplements.

Dr Jendle has published his findings in the American Journal of Clinical Endocrinology.
