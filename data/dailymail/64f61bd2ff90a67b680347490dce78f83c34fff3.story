A wife with a 'fiery temper' who killed her husband by setting fire to him in bed has been found guilty of murder.

Georgina Pontes Furtado Vilela, 47, was sentenced to 23 years in prison after being convicted of murder and arson with intent to endanger life at Wolverhampton Crown Court earlier today.

During the two week trial the court heard how HIV-positive Vilela had suffered from depression and felt 'like an incomplete woman' as a result of not being able to bear Mr Vilela children.

The serious house fire she started happened while four of her step-daughters were also in the home.

It had been started in the first floor back bedroom by Georgina, from Walsall, who is believed to have deliberately poured petrol on her 45-year-old husband Carlos, as he lay on the bed.

She then left the property and watched as neighbours and emergency services battled to rescue Carlos and four of his six daughters, aged 13 to 21, who were all trapped inside.

The most seriously injured daughter, Josefina
then aged 14, suffered 60 per cent burns in the blaze and had to be 
rescued from inside the house by the fire service.

She
was resuscitated by emergency services at the scene and has only 
recently been discharged from hospital, with life changing injuries.

Carlos Vilela was killed in a house fire at his home in Pleck Road, Walsall in March, last year

One of the daughters, aged 17 at the time, suffered a broken pelvis and leg after she jumped from the first floor window.

The
21-year-old daughter suffered smoke inhalation as well as cuts and 
bruises, while a 13-year-old girl was rescued by neighbours as she 
climbed onto a porch roof.

Judge
John Warner sentenced Vilela to life for the charge of murder with a 
minimum sentence of 23 years and 10 years to run concurrently for the 
charge of arson with intent to endanger life.

He
said: 'You are 47 years of age, a lady of previous good character. The 
jury have convicted you of murdering your husband and for arson with 
intent to endanger life.

'You
killed your husband in the most horrific way by throwing petrol on him 
from the container you bought in the week before the murder.

'You set fire to him on the bed you 
and he shared. It was a very serious fire. Your four stepdaughters were 
in the house at the time and you knew it.

'Helena fractured her leg and pelvis 
escaping the fire. Josefina, now aged 15, had to be rescued by 
firefighters and received catastrophic injuries.

'Both her legs had to be amputated at
the knee and her arm as well. She remains in hospital. Her life has 
been totally ruined by what you have done. '

Georgina Vilela poured petrol on her husband after finding out he had fathered a love child and then set their Walsall home alight, killing him and seriously injuring his daughter

Your husband was in a vulnerable 
position and at your mercy with that lethal source of petrol and 
ignition that you used to such a devastating effect and you did intend 
to kill him.

'The act of setting fire to him was 
something you had contemplated for some time before you did it and at 
the time we have heard you had conversations with your stepdaughters 
about wanting to appear in the newspapers or TV.'

Detective Sergeant Rob Bastin, from 
the Major Investigation Review Team, said 'This tragic event has clearly
devastated the family and has had a significant effect on the community
around them.

'I would like
to thank all of the emergency workers who attended the scene on that 
tragic morning, in particular the fire service, whose efforts saved the 
life of the 14-year-old girl trapped inside.

'I also want to pay tribute to the community spirited neighbours who helped rescue the girls, who, without their help, may not have survived.

'This was a horrific case, in which Viella acted in a cold and calculating way. We have evidence of her buying petrol from a garage a couple of days before the murder.

'This was a premeditated act, which left six daughters without a father and at least one of those girls with life changing injuries.'

Carlos Vilela’s had moved to England in 2006 from Portugal, settling in Walsall a year later.

They said 'We are pleased that justice has been done for our much missed father Carlos and for all the people that Georgina put at risk by her actions.

'However, we do forgive Georgina for what she did and we are now looking forward to moving on with our lives to a positive future.

'We would like to thank our family, friends and all the different authorities who have helped and supported us through this difficult time.

West Midlands Fire Service, West Midlands Police, Joseph Leckie School, our church and particularly Birmingham Children’s Hospital, for their wonderful care of Josefina following her injuries.'
