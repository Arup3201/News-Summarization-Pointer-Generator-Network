They are perhaps Gibraltar's most famous residents.

And these macaques have proved why, posing for the camera and sharing their intimate family moments with a holidaymaker who managed to capture them on camera. 

The start of the show is a baby monkey who enjoyed frequent cuddles from mum and even reached out to try and grab the camera.  

This precious baby monkey has the time of his life as he is doted upon by mum, dad and older sibling

The adorable photos of the doting Macaque family were captured by photographer Barry Bland

Doesn't it look like she's smiling? The monkey mum happily looks down at her newest addition 

Aside from a cuddle with his mum, the tiny baby is also offered his older sibling's finger to suck upon

Carefully attended to by its family, the young macaque is seen being protected by its dad and older sibling, as well.

The primates all cluster around the family's new addition, with mum taking time out for a quick feeding.

And as if it's not spoiled enough, the youngster is also given its older sibling's finger to suck upon.

Photographer Barry Bland captured the sweet scene after stopping off in Gibraltar with his wife and children.

The family is currently sailing around the world aboard a yacht called 'Matilda.'
