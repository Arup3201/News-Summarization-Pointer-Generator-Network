Fit of rage: This is the 41-year-old father who is charged with murder for killing the registered sex offender who molested his daughter

An Alabama father has been charged with murder after he gunned down the man who molested his 7-year-old daughter in 2001.

Police say the father gunned down Raymond Earl Brooks, 59, at his parents' home in rural Cullman County, Alabama, Sunday night.

It capped off a rampage that also saw him drive across the county on his motorcycle and allegedly open fire on his step-daughter's boyfriend outside a gas station.

The intended victim got away by running into the store and hiding, Cullman County Chief Deputy Max Barlett Â Bartlett said.

MailOnline is not naming the suspect to protect the identity of Brooks' victim.

Police say they do not know what prompted the shootings - whether he was motivated by the attack on his young daughter 13 years ago or whether a new issue was to blame.

Barlett said the father did make a statement to deputies after he was arrested Sunday night, but Barlett said he could not comment on what the man had said.

The father and Brooks 'obviously didn't have a whole lot of good blood between them,' but it was unknown whether the shooting was directly linked to the sex abuse case, Bartlett said.

'It is odd. He apparently had a lot of stressors going on in his life,' Bartlett said.

The suspect's father told MailOnline he has no idea why he might have waited 13 years to attack Brooks.

He said he hadn't heard his son talk about the attack since the trial in 2001 and 2002.

Documents show the suspect was a witness 
against Brooks in a sexual abuse case involving his daughter in 2001. 
Police said the girl was 8 at the time, but court records show she was 
7.

Shot dead: Raymond Earl Brooks, 59, who was convicted of molesting a 7-year-old girl in 2002, was gunned down at his parents' home

Brooks pleaded guilty to sexual abuse in 2002 and initially was sentenced to five years in prison but later received probation, records show. He finished paying $2,946 in restitution and costs in 2009.

Barlett 
said Brooks was shot several times at the home of his parents, where he 
had been living, shortly after the shooting at the store. The father 
apparently rode his motorcycle straight to the house after the first 
shooting, Bartlett said, but the reason was unclear.

The suspect used a 9mm pistol that he was legally permitted to carry in both shootings.

The man also was charged with attempted murder and shooting into an occupied building, Bartlett said.

The suspect had been arrested twice before for domestic violence, though the charges were either dismissed or he was found not guilty.

Already, some of the man's family members and community members are posting on comment boards that Brooks 'got what he deserved' for the 2001 molestation.

Barlett said Brooks has not violated his probation or his sex offender restrictions since his release from prison.

'As it stands right now, the defendant committed a murder. We look at it no different, no matter the history of the victim. Mr Brooks had previously been sentenced and released for his crime,' he said.

'Regardless of any past or pending crimes that he may have committed, this was murder.'
