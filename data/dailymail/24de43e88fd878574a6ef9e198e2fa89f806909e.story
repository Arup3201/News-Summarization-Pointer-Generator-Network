Mario Balotelli has once again elected to wear the No 45 jersey at Liverpool - revealing he chooses the number because it 'brings (him) luck'.

The 24-year-old completed a sensational £16million move from AC Milan to the Reds on Monday and becomes Brendan Rodgers' ninth summer signing.

Balotelli was asked why he always elected for the No 45 - a number he has also donned at Inter Milan, AC Milan and Manchester City - and he revealed the logic behind it.

Lucky: Mario Balotelli has chosen to wear the No 45 jersey at Liverpool, the same number he has always worn

Arrival: Balotelli completed a £16million move from AC Milan to Liverpool on Monday and trained alone

Goals: Balotelli netted four times in his first four games in the shirt at Inter Milan and chose to keep it

Joy: Balotelli says he chose 45 because he was joking around that four plus five is the number nine

Trouble: Balotelli wore the No 45 under Roberto Mancini at Manchester City during his previous spell in England

Joke: Youngsters had to wear between No 30 to No 50 and Balotelli chose No 45, a number he wore at Milan

He told Liverpoolfc.com: When I first played three or four games with Inter Milan, when I was young, I had No 45 because the numbers for young players were from No 36 to No 50.

'I took No 45 because I was joking that four plus five is nine - and I scored in all four games.

'It brings me luck and that's why I've always kept No 45.'

He trained alone at Liverpool's Melwood training ground before heading to the Etihad Stadium where he will meet up with his new team-mates.

The Italian will then watch his new side take on his former club City in the Premier League from the directors' box.
