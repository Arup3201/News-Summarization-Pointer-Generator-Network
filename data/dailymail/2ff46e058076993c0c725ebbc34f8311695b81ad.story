It still has the same gleaming red paintwork and immaculate grey nylon weave interior as it did the day it rolled off the assembly line.

The odometer shows just delivery mileage and there are no proper licence plates as the owner has not yet had it registered with the DVLA.

Which is odd, since the car in question is a Ford Cortina Mark V, built more than 30 years ago.

Pride and joy: Frank Sheach, from Dundee, with the 31-year-old Ford Cortina which he is selling

Despite its venerable age, this unique 'brand new' GL-badged Cortina has never been driven on a public road, as the absence of wear on its tyres testifies, and its Scots owner Frank Sheach has only ever allowed it out of locked storage on the back of a trailer for rare appearances at classic car shows.

Now, the 47-year-old car enthusiast, who bought the car seven years ago for £9,995, has decided to auction off his pride and joy and the car’s unusual provenance could spark a bidding war among fanatical old Ford collectors.

Mr Sheach, a member of the Tayside Classic Car Club, said yesterday: 'I don’t think there will be another one in this condition. There’s only delivery mileage on the clock and it’s brand new. 

First-class conditon: Mr Sheach, a member of the Tayside Classic Car Club, said yesterday: 'I don't think there will be another one in this condition. There's only delivery mileage on the clock and it's brand new'

Unique: Mr Sheach's 2.0L, four-speed petrol version was among the last batch of Mk Vs to leave Ford's Dagenham plant in 1981 before production switched to the new Sierra model

'Initially, I bought it to drive it. I had already done up another Cortina as a hobby and I have always liked them. They were the type of cars I worked on when I did my engineering apprenticeship so I always had a soft spot for them.

Overview At first glance the Cortina ‘80 didn’t look much different to the MkIV, but it received a huge number of improvements that kept it on top until the arrival of the Sierra in 1982.

The most prized models are the wood-trimmed Ghia and the run-out Crusader, which buyers clamoured for in 1982, in preference to buying a new Sierra.

Top speed: 87mph

Power: 61bhp 

Torque: 68lb/ft

Length: 4326mm

Wheelbase: 2578mm

Width: 1702mm

Height: 1321mm

'Because of its unique history, I always resisted driving it. I used to take it to car rallies on the back of trailer puller by my other Cortina, which is actually older.

'But there is only so long you can keep doing that, so I have decided to sell up and give someone else the pleasure of owning this piece of Britain’s motoring history.'

More than 2,600,000 Ford Cortinas were sold in Britain in the 20 years since its launch in 1962, making it the third most popular car ever sold in the UK. A Mk III revived popularity when it starred in the hit BBC One detective series Life On Mars.

The MkV easily stood out from the MkIV predecessor due to its larger lamp clusters, wraparound bumpers and newly-designed aeroflow radiator grille. Build quality and rust resistance were also improved.

Mr Sheach’s 2.0L, four-speed petrol version was among the last batch of Mk Vs to leave Ford’s Dagenham plant in 1981 before production switched to the new Sierra model.

It was immediately snapped up by Midlands millionaire TC Harrison, who had a number of Ford dealerships around the country and built up a celebrated collection of 'last ever' models.

The vehicle was sent direct from the factory to TC Harrison Group in 1982 with no fluids and had been dry stored for 23 years, before being sold to Mr Schiach in 2005 for £9,995.

When father-of-two Mr Sheach, who is chief engineer for National Express in Dundee, bought the car seven years ago, he left the DVLA 'flummoxed” when he tried to register it for use.

'I got it after I was told about it by someone in my car club. They said a multi-millionaire enthusiast called TC Harrison had kept it in his collection since buying it new. Apparently, he used to buy the last model made of different kinds of cars and he bought this one when Ford stopped making Cortinas and started the Sierra. 'He kept it until he died and then I bought it.

Up for auction: Frank Sheach will be hoping a keen Ford fan is taken with the Cortina

Showroom shine: Mr Sheach added: 'I have no idea what it would be worth now, but it would have been about £5,500 new in 1981. I am still considering my options for how best to auction it'

'It came out the same year the Sierra
was launched and it doesn’t even have a number plate. The plate just 
says Cortina. Anybody who buys it can choose their own number if they 
want to register it.

'I
went to the DVLA and asked what number it would get and they didn’t 
know. They had never been asked about the first registration of such an 
old car before and it completely flummoxed them.

'Eventually
somebody said there was no reason why it could not be given the latest 
number available, which would make it a 61-plate. Then, they said it 
could be given a number that would have been generated on the computer 
from 1981, which would make it a Y-reg.'

Mr Sheach added: 'I have no idea what it would be worth now, but it would have been about £5,500 new in 1981. I am still considering my options for how best to auction it.

Dave Richards, editor of Classic Car Weekly magazine, said: 'This is very exciting news to see a Ford from the Harrison collection come onto the market and still in such good condition, although anyone who wants to drive it will have to spend a bit of money making it road-worthy.

'It is possible that Mr Sheach only manage to get back what he paid for the car at auction, but Ford collectors can be fanatical and if two of them decide they really want it then the sky’s the limit really.'
