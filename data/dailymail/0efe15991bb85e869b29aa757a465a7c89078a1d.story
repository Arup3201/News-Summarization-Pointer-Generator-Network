Former BJP chief Bangaru Laxman could have endangered the lives of hundreds of thousands of soldiers for some money and personal gain, a special court observed on Saturday while sentencing the 72-year-old to four years in prison.

Laxman, who was caught on tape accepting a bribe from journalists pretending to be arms dealers, was also slapped with a fine of Rs100,000.

'The convict had kept his individual interests over and above the national interest and had even agreed to compromise the security and safety of the nation,' additional sessions judge Kanwal Jeet Arora said.

She added that 'corruption is worse than prostitution as it endangers the whole society'.

'(He) agreed to compromise with the lives of lakhs of soldiers who, without fearing for their lives, fight for the nation'.

In 2001, Laxman had been caught in a sting operation receiving Rs100,000 in bribe from Tehelka.com journalists who had claimed to be representatives of a fake UK-based arms manufacturing company.

The video showed Laxman accepting 
money from 'West End International' officials who were seeking his 
recommendation for the supply of hand-held thermal imagers to the Indian
 Army.

Jailed: Bangaru Laxman, former President of the BJP

The court, while considering what 
sentence to give Laxman, was alarmed at the cavalier attitude with which
 he was ready to exercise his influence over defence contracts.

'Even
 in the very first meeting with the representatives of a company, (he) 
had agreed to extend his influence for getting a supply order in their 
favour, with respect to defence-related equipment for his personal 
gains, without giving it a thought that the equipment of this company 
may or may not be of standard quality,' the court said.

Despite
 'West End International' being a fictitious company and fake arms 
dealers, the court said Laxman's willingness to influence the defence 
contract in return for illegal gratification was genuine.

This
 conclusion led the court to convict the former BJP president under 
section 9 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which entails a prison 
sentence ranging from six months to five years.

Though the defence counsel had argued for leniency, saying the 72-year-old suffers from diabetes and health issues, the CBI demanded maximum punishment, saying it would deter others from going down the path of corruption.

'Considering the gravity and the impact which his influence would have had on the lives of the soldiers of Indian Army, had the design of convict materialised, I am of the opinion that there are no mitigating circumstances and he does not deserve the leniency,' the court said.

'Being president of a political party (he) was supposed to have shown exemplary character to lead by example. But that was not to be.'

Bangaru Laxman, the septuagenarian Former BJP chief, now faces four years behind bars at Tihar — and he will have work since he has been sentenced to rigorous imprisonment.

Laxman was brought to Tihar Prisons on Saturday after he was sentenced.

R.N Sharma, DIG, Tihar Prisons, said he will be lodged in ward 15 of jail No. 4, the same one where sacked Commonwealth Games organising committee chief Suresh Kalmadi (pictured) had been lodged.

No special arrangements have been made for him, Sharma added.

He
 will join former telecom minister A. Raja and former telecom secretary 
Siddhartha Behura — being tried in the 2G scam — as fellow inmates.

The verdict gave the Congress the 
ammunition to gun for the BJP. 'It is for the first time that the former
 president of a national party has been found guilty of corruption and 
has been sentenced. It's the right time for the BJP to introspect and 
self-analyse.

'The Opposition party has lost all moral rights to talk about corruption,' Congress spokesperson Rashid Alvi said.

The
 BJP attempted to counter the jibes. Party spokesperson Prakash 
Javadekar said in Nagpur: 'The Congress should not lecture us on 
morality.'

He went on to 
add: 'The way the CBI has shown quickness of action in this case, it 
should also show the same pace in the alleged corruption cases such as 
the 2G scam, the Commonwealth Games scam and cases involving former 
finance minister and current home minister P. Chidambaram.'
