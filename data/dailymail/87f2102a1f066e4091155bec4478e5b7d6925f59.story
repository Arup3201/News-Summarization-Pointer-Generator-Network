A couple allegedly locked a seven-year-old in an outdoor cage for three weeks for punishment - with just a bucket to use for the bathroom and a cot.

Jena Harman, the child's mother, and her boyfriend, Alexander Smith, face up to 20 years jail for allegedly caging the child outside their Laramie, Wyoming, home.

Police said the six-by-five-foot cage was made in June from cattle paneling and wooden snow fence with plywood covering half of the opening.

A metal chain and 'dog-leash-style 
latch' were allegedly used to keep the child locked in with clothing, books, a toothbrush, toothpaste and a five-gallon bucket, Laramie Boomerang reported.

According to court documents, the child, whose gender was not identified by authorities, spent most of the time inside the cage, including to use the restroom.

The child ate once a day - if Harman remembered to bring food. Harman released the seven-year-old from the cage when Smith, a truck driver, was not around, according to police.

Smith lived in a camper near the home.

The child reported being kicked by Harman and Smith, sprayed with a hose and was kept in the cage outside even during rainstorms.

Before moving to the cage, the child allegedly slept on the floor or on a couch in Harman's home.

Police arrested Harman and Smith on July 24 following a tip off.

The couple is charged with one count each of child abuse and three counts each of felonious restraint, according to District Court felony information documents.

If guilty of all four counts, Harman and Smith each face up to 20 years in jail.

According to an affidavit, Harman told deputies she and Smith kept the child in the 'playpen' because the seven-year-old 'was constantly doing bad things'.

Smith told deputies he disliked the child but wanted to keep the juvenile safe in a cage. Smith said the child appeared to like the cage.

According to Laramie Boomerang, the Sheriffâ€™s Office began receiving complaints of child abuse and requests for welfare checks in August last year.

Smith and Harman remain in custody on a $100,000 cash bond at the Albany County Detention Center in Laramie, Wyoming.
