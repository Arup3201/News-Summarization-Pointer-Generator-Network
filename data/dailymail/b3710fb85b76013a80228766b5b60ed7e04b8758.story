Behaviour: Elizabeth Edmonds was allegedly so high that other teachers noticed her erratic behaviour

An elementary school teacher has been suspended after she was accused of trying to teach her class while high on drugs.

Elizabeth Edmonds was so high that other teachers noticed her erratic behaviour, it was claimed.

The 30 year old was removed from the class and ordered to undergo a drugs test which proved positive.

Officials in Lake County, Florida, said Edmonds tested positive for marijuana and opiates after leaving the Treadway Elementary in Leesburg.

Edmonds, a third-grade teacher, has been on paid suspension since the incident on September 12th with the suspension extended without pay.

School officials are expected to meet later to discuss firing the teacher.

Parents with children at the school were shocked by the teacher's involvement with drugs.

'To hear that she's doing drugs herself and going to school and being responsible for a whole classroom of students all day, it's just shocking,' said Keith Douglas, a grandfather of one of Edmond's former students.

Douglas told WFTV his grandson had Edmonds as a teacher two years ago.

Concerns: Keith Douglas, a grandfather of one of Edmond's former students told WFTV his grandson had problems with Ms Edmonds and the boy's family even pulled him out of her classroom

He said his grandson had problems with her and the boy's family even pulled him out of her classroom.

'To think that when my grandson was in her class, that she was may be high on these drugs, you never know what could happen,' said Douglas.

District officials said they had not had any problems with Edmonds before.

Officials said Edmonds had been at Treadway Elementary for three years.
