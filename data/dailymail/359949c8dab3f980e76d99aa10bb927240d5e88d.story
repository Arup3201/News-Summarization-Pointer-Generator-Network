Kim Kallstrom could make his debut for Arsenal in Sunday's North London derby at Tottenham.

The 31-year-old Sweden international is yet to feature for the Gunners since he arrived on the final day of the January transfer window.

Kallstrom signed for Arsenal with a back injury, but speaking ahead of his side's trip to White Hart Lane, manager Arsene Wenger revealed the midfielder is back in training.

'Kallstrom joined the normal training group on Thursday and Yaya Sanogo, too,' said Wenger.

'I will have to decide if Kallstrom is OK to be in the squad on Sunday. I will see how he looks. It is not impossible.'

Wenger
 however, revealed that Mesut Ozil, who suffered a hamstring injury in 
the draw at Bayern Munich earlier this week, could be sidelined for six 
weeks, while Aaron Ramsey, injured in Arsenal's win at West Ham on 
Boxing Day, faces a prolonged spell away from the first team.

'Ozil is injured and we don't know how long - maybe minimum three weeks, but the maximum is six,' added Wenger.

'But
 I'm not specialist enough to know how long a grade two hamstring is. He
 was handicapped early on and I saw him stretching I asked my physio at 
the time.

'Ramsey is a bit apprehensive with his thigh, and he could be out for another two weeks.'

Ozil
 is believed to have injured his hamstring in the opening 10 minutes of 
the second-leg, last-16 clash at the Allianz Arena but carried on 
playing until half-time and aggravated the problem.

He was checked by Arsenal’s medical team during the break and also saw Bayern’s Germany team doctor Hans Muller Wohlfahrt.

Ozil's setback is the latest in a series of serious injuries to senior members of Wenger's squad.

Jack
 Wilshere will miss around two months with a foot injury sustained on 
international duty last week and Theo Walcott is out until next season 
with a torn anterior cruciate ligament.

'I
 am concerned because if you look at the list we are missing big 
players,' Wenger said. 'We are analysing deeply why it has happened and 
to see if there is a link.

'Some of it is bad luck, but the rest we have to find out why. We will analyse everything.'

Arsenal head to Tottenham looking to pull themselves back into the Premier League title race.

Following their FA Cup quarter-final win, the Gunners hold a match in hand on leaders Chelsea, but are seven points off top spot now down in third place.

Wenger is expecting a focused display from his side in what will be a heated atmosphere.

'It has been always difficult at White Hart Lane, but we are in a position where of course we want to win the game, because after (losing at) Stoke, it is very important,' Wenger said.

'We had a good result against Everton, we had a good result even at Bayern, but that we continue and have no weak moment any more until the end of the season.'

Wenger added: 'It is a difficult ground to go to for everybody. We had good and bad memories there, so let's make sure the good comes out on Sunday.'
