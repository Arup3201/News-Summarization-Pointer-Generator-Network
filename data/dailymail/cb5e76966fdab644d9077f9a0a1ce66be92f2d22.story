Overall acceptance of gays and lesbians in American religious congregations rose significantly between 2006 and 2012, but it declined in Catholic congregations, according to a new survey.

Duke University's National Congregations Study, derived from interviews with representatives of 1,331 American congregations, was released Thursday.

The study found overall acceptance of gay and lesbian members increased from 37 per cent to 48 per cent over the six-year period.

'The increasing acceptance of gays and lesbians is a well-known trend in America,' said Mark Chaves, a Duke professor of sociology, religious studies, and divinity, who  directs the study. 'Churches are no exception.'

But for Catholic churches, the number of congregations that accepted gays and lesbians as members dropped to 53 per cent from 74 per cent..

Chaves suggested this may be due in part to fallout from the child sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic church, which some associate with homosexuality.

Acceptance of gays and lesbians as volunteer leaders increased from 18 per cent to 26 per cent overall but decreased in Catholic churches from 39 per cent to 26 per cent.

Growth was especially strong among black Protestant churches, white liberal Protestant churches and non-Christian congregations.

White conservative Protestant churches were more accepting of gay and lesbian members but not volunteer leaders.

'Congregations reflect general cultural trends, but they also reflect divisions on this issue,' Chaves said.
