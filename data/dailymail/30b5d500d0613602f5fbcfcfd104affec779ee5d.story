A cute puppy suffering from bent legs has been cured simply by his owners taking him for twice-daily walks.

Golden retriever Kobi first showed signs of wonky paws when he was just three-months-old.

His owners Hannah Lilley and Adam Hazelwood, both 22, took him to a vet after becoming concerned about the shape of his legs.

Golden retriever Kobi, who at three-month-old first showed signs of having wonky paws and bent wrists

At first it was feared Kobi was suffering from irreparable bone damage.

But after seeking a second opinion, vet Terry Dunne told the couple from Hinckley in Leicestershire that Kobi was suffering from carpal laxity syndrome.

The syndrome causes dogs to have difficulty walking due to the wrist joints on their front legs being bent.

But rather than have to undergo painful treatment, Mr Dunne told Kobi's owners all they had to do was give him as much exercise as he could handle.

Miss Lilley said: 'Kobi had been just like a normal puppy at first but then we noticed his wrists were constantly bent.

'As a result we thought it would be best to give him a rest so as not to put any more pressure on him.

But since being diagnosed with carpal laxity syndrome and exercising as much as he can, Kobi, pictured left with owner Hannah Lilley, has seen his wrists straighten out allowing him to run and walk like any other normal dog 

'When we went to see Terry, he told us to do exactly the opposite and take him for walks twice a day.'

And once the couple started Kobi's new exercise regime, the results were almost instant.

Miss Lilley added: 'Within a week, his wrists had straightened out and he was back to normal.

'Now we've got a problem - we can barely keep up with him.'

Mr Dunne, the vet at Fairfield Veterinary Centre in Hinckley said: 'It is a common misconception to try and support the abnormal joints with dressings or casts.

Owners Hannah Lilley and partner Adam Hazelwood, who say they can barely keep up with their pet now he has been cured 

'This has exactly the wrong effect - by protecting the joint in this way only makes it weaker.

'In order for a joint to be restored to good health it must be kept mobile and exercised providing the opportunity for the muscles, tendons and ligaments to develop and mature.'

Now, at five-months-old, Kobi is undergoing standard training, but Miss Lilley, who is an occupational therapist, hopes he will become an assistance dog to help people with brain injuries.

Many dogs who receive a diagnosis of carpal laxity syndrome do go on to lead a normal life after treatment 

Carpal laxity syndrome is a condition that usually affects younger dogs, especially those of a larger breed.

Dogs suffering from the condition have bent wrist joints, which cause them to experience difficulty and lameness when walking on their front legs, although it causes them no pain.

It is unknown what causes the syndrome but experts suggest it could be due to a dog's bones growing faster than their tendons.

Vets say treating the condition can sometimes be difficult as the cause of carpal laxity syndrome is unknown.

However, most suggest that a combination of a healthy diet and plenty of exercise is enough to reverse the effects.

Once treatment for dogs does begin, the recovery rate is fast and high and most dogs go on to lead a normal life
