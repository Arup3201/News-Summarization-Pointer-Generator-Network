A rookie Los Angeles police officer is wanted for questioning in a fatal shooting that left a 23-year-old man dead in Pomona.

The 2013 Volkswagen Jetta belonging to Officer Henry Solis, 27, of the LAPD, was found a short distance from the site where Salome Rodriguez Jr was gunned down early Friday, but the cop remained at large.  

Solis was off-duty at the time of the shooting and failed to report to work the next day. Police said they have reason to believe he knows that detectives want to interview him about the shooting. 

This afternoon, an arrest warrant was issued for the missing officer, who is considered armed and dangerous, according to a statement released by the LAPD.

Rookie: Police say Solis joined the force last June and had not completed his probationary period

Cmdr. Andrew Smith, am LAPD spokesman, said Solis was assigned to a station in the San Fernando Valley and had not completed his probationary period since joining the force last June.

Rodriguez, 23, of Ontario, died after being shot in the lower torso at around 3.30am. He worked at a Williams-Sonoma warehouse and was out with co-workers at Vive Tequila Lounge and Nightclub Thursday night, relatives told the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin.

The LA Times reported that Rodriguez ran bleeding for more than a block before he collapsed to the ground in a parking lot. 

Rodriguez, the oldest of six children, was also a missionary with St. Vincent Catholic Church in Los Angeles, said his mother, Lidia Angelica Rodriguez.

Pomona police have issued a poster calling Solis a 'person of interest' in the shooting that occurred in a downtown bar district after two men got into a fight.

Witnesses told police the attacker fled the scene, and they saw a compact car leaving the area.

Detectives said they don't believe the men who got into the fight knew each other. 

Salome's aunt Aracely Monlina suggested that his killing may have resulted from a case of mistaken identity. 

'Witnesses said Henry Solis got into an altercation earlier,' Monlina told CBS Los Angeles. 'Then I guess he confused Junior with that person, or something and confronted Junior. Junior said, "It's not me, it's not me."'

Monique Ortiz, a friend of Rodriguez's, was with him at the club before the shooting.

She shared a video with NBC Los Angeles showing the 23-year-old dancing and laughing in the hours before the deadly confrontation. 

A man who gave his name as Gene said he was also with Rodriguez at the club until closing time.

Afterwards, the two friends, who had been drinking, got into Gene's Audi and settled in for a nap. 

Gene said when he woke up, he found his vehicle surrounded by police and paramedics. 

Neither Monique Ortiz nor Gene remembered seeing Henry Solis inside the club. 

Meanwhile, Rodriguez's loved ones have launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for his funeral.
