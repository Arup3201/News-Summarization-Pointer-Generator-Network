New details emerged today about Eric Frein's 48 days on the run from police, including how the survivalist charged with ambushing a Pennsylvania state police barracks used a laptop computer to go online. 

According to court documents released Tuesday, state police found Frein's laptop and two storage drives inside an abandoned airplane hangar near the spot where the suspected cop killer was captured Thursday night

Frein told authorities he used unprotected Wi-Fi hotspots to connect to the Internet during his seven-week flight, documents said, raising the possibility he knew where police were focusing their search efforts each day.

It remains unknown how he kept the computer charged. Before his capture, state police had surmised Frein was breaking into cabins and unoccupied vacation homes for food and shelter.

Experts will now analyze Frein's portable computer and thumb drives for Internet search terms, email including contacts, chat and messaging service, Internet browsing history, pictures, graphics files, movie files, text or Word documents, maps, diary or journal, timeline data and historical content of the laptop.

Frein was unarmed when he surrendered to US marshals in an open field near the former Birchwood-Pocono Airpark. He told police a rifle and handgun were inside the hangar, according to an affidavit.

The 31-year-old survivalist and expert marksman is charged with opening fire on the Blooming Grove state police barracks September 12, killing  Cpl. Bryon Dickson and critically wounding Trooper Alex Douglass. 

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Frein has been assigned two public defenders.

One of them, Michael Weinstein, is a former Pike County district attorney who has since gone on to a career in civil litigation and criminal defense.

Payback: Frein was shackled with handcuffs that once belonged to his alleged victim  

Among his current clients is Rockne Newell, who's charged with fatally shooting three people at a municipal meeting last year. 

Frein's other lawyer is Robert Bernathy, Pike County's chief public defender. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for November 12.

Frein was prepared for falling temperatures, wearing an Old Navy gray thermal shirt, sweater and fleece jacket on the day he was caught, along with suspenders and eastern European military pants, according to documents. 

He also wore a Timex watch and a silver necklace with a pendant.

Earlier this week, details contained in a note left by Frein while he was on the run from police were released to the public. 

The note read: 'Fri Sept 12th got a shot around 11pm and took it. He droped [sic]....I was surprised at how quick. I took a follow up shot on his head/kneck neck area.

'He was still and quiet after.....Another cop approached the one I just shot. As he went to kneel I took a shot at him and jumped in the door. His legs were visible and still.'

'I ran back to the jeep....I made maybe half a mile from the GL road and hit a road block. I didn't expect one so soon. It was only 15-20 min.

'I did a K turn ¼ a mile from them and pulled into a development I knew had unfinished acess [sic] road....

'Hearing helos I just used my marker lights missed the train around a run off pool and drove straight into it. ! Disaster! 

'Made half attempt to stash AK and ran.' Police later found the Jeep submerged in water.

Police said they linked Frein to the ambush after a man walking his dog discovered his partly submerged SUV three days later in a swamp a few miles from the shooting scene. Inside, investigators found shell casings matching those found at the barracks as well as Frein's driver's license, camouflage face paint, two empty rifle cases and military gear.

They pursued countless tips and closed in on an area around Frein's parents' home in Canadensis after he used his cellphone to try contacting them and the signal was traced to a location about 3 miles away. At times police ordered nearby residents to stay inside or prevented them from returning home.

Trackers found items they believe Frein hid or abandoned in the woods — including soiled diapers, empty packs of Serbian cigarettes, an AK-47-style assault rifle and ammunition and two pipe bombs that were functional and capable of causing significant damage.

They also discovered a journal, allegedly kept by Frein and found in a bag of trash at a hastily abandoned campsite, that offered a chilling account of the ambush and his subsequent escape into the woods. The journal's author described Dickson as falling "still and quiet" after being shot twice.

Police spotted a man they believed to be Frein at several points during the manhunt, but it was always from a distance, with the rugged terrain allowing him to keep them at bay. Police said he appeared to be treating the manhunt as a game.

Authorities believe Frein had been planning a confrontation with police for years, citing information they found on a computer used by him.

Thursday’s quiet takedown of Frein, who kneeled and put his hands up when marshals approached him, ended weeks of tension and turmoil in the area, as authorities at times closed schools, canceled outdoor events and blockaded roads to pursue him. 

Frein has been charged with first-degree murder, homicide of a law enforcement officer, attempted first-degree murder, possession of weapons of mass destruction, discharging a firearm into an occupied structure and reckless endangerment.
