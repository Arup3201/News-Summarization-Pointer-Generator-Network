Crown Prosecution Service chiefs are at the centre of a row over a £623,555 secret payout to a senior civil servant who they have refused to name.

The massive redundancy package was among nearly 1,300 handed out to lawyers and civil servants working for the CPS over the past three years. But none have been publicly named.

Last night a former senior CPS lawyer said the agency had a duty to name the highest paid individual because the compensation was public money.

Cuts: There have been nearly 1,300 redundancy packages which averaged at £48, 434 handed out by the Crown Prosecution Service in the last three years

He said: ‘If the BBC are able to name top executives who receive golden payouts, I can see no reason why this shouldn’t apply to people working at the CPS.’

But a CPS spokesman said it had to honour the confidentiality of the severance deal, which prevents the individual being named.

Details of the payment were obtained under a Freedom Of Information request which also showed that the average payout at the CPS between 2009 and 2012 was £48,434 – some £6,000 more than the average across Whitehall, according to HMRC.

Explaining the size of the payoff, a CPS spokesman said: ‘As a government department, the CPS is bound by Civil Service-wide pension rules.

'This severance payment to a senior employee was made under the old Civil Service pension rules, which contractually entitled long-standing employees to up to six years’ pay if they were made redundant.’

He added: ‘The CPS had no discretion in the size of this payment. Following the reform to the pension rules, an employee of similar seniority and length of service who was made redundant today would receive a much smaller compensation payment.

'This payment included a confidentiality clause and we are legally bound not to name the former employee.’

The majority of the 1,282 CPS payoffs are in response to Coalition budget cuts across Whitehall.

A CPS spokesman added: ‘Following the Government’s comprehensive spending review in 2010, the CPS, like most government departments, has been required to make significant savings in its overall budget.’

He added: ‘The savings will inevitably involve a reduction in staff through voluntary routes and we have offered a series of exit schemes since 2010.

'These have enabled us to reduce senior staff and managers and headquarters employees, while protecting frontline services. The scheme is in full accordance with Cabinet Office guidance.’
