One person is dead and another being treated for life-threatening injuries after a bluff at the end of a popular hiking trail at Point Reyes National Seashore collapsed.

The two visitors were standing on the Arch Rock lookout point just before 6 p.m. on Saturday when the bluff gave way and the pair fell about 70 feet, winding up covered with rocks and debris. 

Collapse: A bluff collapsed at Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, killing one hiker and leaving a second with life-threatening injuries

The National Park Service had posted signs at the site two days earlier warning hikers that a fissure along the top of Arch Rock may have weakened the cliff and that walking along the edge was dangerous.

The park did not close the trail and in spite of the warnings, one hiker who visited the park that day told the San Francisco Chronicle she had seen dozens of people walking in the area that day.

'It was clear no one should be on that rock with the huge fissure,' Karen Blasing said. 'We stayed back, but many others were unconcerned and dangerously taking chances.' 

KBCW reports that other park-goers scrambled to assist before officials from Marin County fire, sheriff, and Park Rangers arrived to rescue the pair.

A Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office carried the pair to the trailhead, where a medical chopper was waiting.

One of the hikers was pronounced dead at the scene. The other was airlifted to a hospital. They have not been identified.

After the fall, the trail was closed entirely, with the National Park Service posted a message to their website. 'The area leading up to Arch Rock is closed for your safety,' the message read. 'The land may still be unstable and further collapse or erosion could occur.'
