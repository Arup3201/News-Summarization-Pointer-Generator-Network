Annie star Quvenzhané Wallis yawned her way through an interview with the New York Times Style magazine, telling the publication's writer that she found the process 'a little boring'. 

According to journalist Nicholas Haramis the 11-year-old, who features on the front cover of this weekend's edition of the magazine, the youngster struggled to feign interest in the interview, and perhaps unsurprisingly given her age, couldn't wait to put an end to his questions so she could return to her video games. 

'I try to get a few more details about what it’s like to balance homework and Hollywood fame' he writes. '“How about three more questions?” she says. “Make them big so I can answer them big.”

'Sometimes it gets a little boring': The 11-year-old Oscar nominee was more than happy to admit she doesn't find interviews all that entertaining

'I rack my brain for another, but I’m too slow. “We’re done now,” she says.' 

Even discussions about her Annie co-stars Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz - both of whom have waxed lyrical about her abilities as an actress - failed to raise much interest from the precocious youngster. 

'Inquiries into inspiration and motivation elicit eye rolls,' Haramis says. 'At one point, while discussing the director and co-stars of her new film, Annie — Will Gluck is a “really nice man,” Jamie Foxx is “a really nice guy” and Cameron Diaz is “really nice” — she lets out an exasperated yawn.'

The Oscar-nominated star, who is the youngest person to receive a nod for Best Actress, having been nominated for her role in Beasts of the Southern Wild when she was only six, makes no attempt to hide her boredom throughout the interview, even explaining to Haramis that she finds the process 'a little boring'. 

'I'm not gonna name names,' she says. 'But sometimes when reporters are talking it gets a little boring because I don't have any jokes to tell because the questions are so serious.'

Clearly intent on making the New York Times interview a little bit more entertaining, Quvenzhané then proceeds challenge Haramis to try his hand at her favorite basketball-focused arcade game Hoop Fever, demanding that he pay up $1 when he loses. 

A friend - and a movie star: Quvenzhané Wallis reveals to the New York Times Style that her schoolfriends at home don't view her any differently, despite her successful movie career 

'Wallis’s precocious, at times petulant charm — littered with as much toilet humor as schoolyard sagacity — is her secret weapon,' Haramis later says of the young star. 'And it’s what makes her stand out from all the pretween beauty queens who’ve been trained to follow a script.'

But while her interview manner might not be up to scratch, her career has continued to go from strength to strength. In addition to her role in big-screen blockbuster Annie, which is due out on December 19, Quvenzhané is also set to star in two more feature films next year - and earlier this year was revealed as the first ever celebrity face of Armani Junior.

She insists, however, that life at home has not changed all that much since Hollywood first came knocking five years ago.

Now and then: The youngster will soon be seen starring in a remake of hit musical Annie (L), having made her big screen debut in Beasts of the Southern Wild, which earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (R)

'Of course, when strangers see me they're star-struck because of who I am, but my friends take me as a friend because I'm their friend — not because I'm a movie star,' the precocious young star explains. 

But for those who don't know the youngster on a personal level, her life appears to be very different from that of a normal 11-year-old.

Quvenzhané has spent the last few weeks on a whirlwind promotional tour for the upcoming remake of hit musical Annie, in which she stars in the title role, alongside Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz - both of whom admit to being bowled over by her talent. 

'I was so impressed with her,' 46-year-old Jamie said, while Cameron said of the pressure Quvenzhané faced taking on such an iconic role: 'I'm not certain that a girl that age has that kind of awareness. I don't think Q did, anyhow.'
