Manchester city centre was torn apart by looters as young as nine in the worst riots in the city for 30 years. Hundreds of youths and ‘feral’ children stormed through the streets 
smashing windows and stealing clothing, mobile phones and jewellery.

Shops and bins were set on fire as police struggled to keep up with marauding gangs in a cat-and-mouse chase across the city.

Yesterday police chiefs admitted they had been ‘overwhelmed’ by the 
scale of the disturbances and had to call on neighbouring forces to 
assist.

They came from outlying towns and districts to the city centre with only one thing on their mind – a night of lawless mayhem.

The young Manchester thugs’ brazen attitude and belief they will face no punishment has stunned police. One 15-year-old masked looter said: ‘They can’t touch me. I’m still a kid.

‘The police can’t hit us, they can’t injure us and when they arrest us they have to let us go so we don’t care what we do on the streets. ‘I’ve got phones and clothes from the raids and what is the worst they can do? Give me a caution or a curfew I won’t obey.’ Another boy said: ‘I’ll keep doing this every day until I get caught. When I get home, I might get shouted at, but that’s it. This’ll be my first offence.

‘The prisons are overcrowded – what are they going to do, give me an Asbo? I’ll live with that.’

A teenage girl who raided a mobile phone store and smashed a BlackBerry on the pavement said: ‘It don’t mean nothing, this. We’re not in it for the stuff, we’re in it for the laugh.’

And a girl who claimed she left school at 13 said: ‘All these rich businesses for rich people are getting a bit of payback and it’s about time the ordinary poor person had a say in this country.’

Free for all: Hooded youths spill out of the damaged store in Manchester after filling their pockets with cigarettes and bottles of alcohol

A police station was firebombed and more than 90 people arrested as rioting blighted Nottingham. Canning Circus police station was attacked by a group of up to 40 men at around 10pm on Tuesday but no injuries were reported.

Meadows police station was also attacked by a gang of 15 to 20 men and a police car was set alight.Police said it was one of ten force cars that were damaged across the area on a second night of disturbances.

The violence followed the arrest of ten youths after a small group got on to the roof of one of the buildings at fee-paying Nottingham High School. Groups of youths using masks and hoods to hide their identities congregated around parts of the city setting light to cars and attacking businesses, pubs and community centres.

Nottinghamshire Police said hundreds of officers were deployed to contain numerous incidents of criminal activity and of ‘gratuitous violence’.

A spokesman said from 6pm until just before midnight, the force had dealt with more than 1,000 incidents. Elsewhere in the East Midlands, Leicestershire Police said 13 people were arrested after disturbances in Leicester city centre.

In a night of mayhem which caused millions of pounds of damage, the 
rioters used social networking sites, mobile phones and texts to 
exchange information.

Then, huge gangs of masked youths slipped through the back streets, 
avoiding police lines to strike at the next store in what appeared to be
 co-ordinated manoeuvres.

Around 1,000 riot police, officers on horseback and dog handlers 
desperately tried to flush them out – but the gangs worked with 
lightning speed and were able to swarm through a store and empty it of 
all valuable goods in just minutes.

Officers would arrive to discover 
places ransacked before receiving another emergency call to the next 
store.

The trouble flared in the Tuesday evening rush hour when two youths used
 a stone slab to smash the front door of Foot Asylum in the Arndale 
Centre.

They were followed into the store by more than 50 others.

A mob broke into Bang & Olufsen, cleaning it out of its luxury 
electrical items, while Miss Selfridge was set alight. An 18-year-old 
was arrested on suspicion of arson.

Former Oasis star Liam Gallagher’s recently-opened fashion boutique – 
Pretty Green – also fell victim. For more than an hour St Ann’s Square –
 a busy shopping district – was under mob rule with a dozen stores being
 raided or smashed up.

Children as young as nine were believed to be on the street during the height of the disturbances.

One witness said: ‘I asked one child how old he was and he said he was 
nearly ten. I was disgusted.

'He claimed he was shopping with his brother
 but I later saw them both tearing down Market Street with a pack of 
masked teenagers.’

In nearby Salford youths fought a running battle with riot police, 
smashing shop windows and bus shelters and using bricks and rubble to 
pelt officers. Two cars, one a BBC radio vehicle, lay overturned and 
burnt out.

Firemen came under attack from missile-throwing yobs as they attended incidents at a Lidl supermarket and several shop fires.

Although Britain’s major cities bore the brunt of the violence, the menace spread almost as far as the lush hills and valleys of the Cotswolds.

The cathedral city of Gloucester was  targeted late on Tuesday as scores of hoodie-wearing youths clashed with police, attacked shops and set fire to buildings.Intent on demonstrating that they too could sink to the levels of behaviour they had seen on television, they struck at Argos, HMV, Primark, betting shops and a convenience store.

Police, including mounted officers drafted in from other forces, were pelted with rocks and bottles. Eight fire crews tackled a blaze at a former Gloucester College of Art and  Technology building, which has been empty since 2007.

In total 200 police officers were  involved in the operation, which continued into the early hours of yesterday. None was injured. By the evening there had been 14 arrests.

Deputy Chief Constable Mick Matthews said the rioters were local youths, adding: ‘What we have seen in Gloucester have been copycat incidents which do not appear to have been co-ordinated in any way.’

The Very Rev Stephen Lake, Dean of Gloucester, added: ‘These things just don’t happen here. That shows what happened was opportunism and copycat rioting.’

City by city, the violence erupted: In Birmingham, left, a suspected looter is pinned to the ground near New Street railway station on Tuesday; Liverpool, middle, sees fires burn as youths go on the rampage during clashes in Toxteth; In Nottingham, right, a police station in Canning Circus is firebombed and a policewoman stands guard

Police made 113 arrests as more than 100
 premises were attacked across Greater Manchester. A police source said:
 ‘We have information that children of primary school age were out on 
the streets.

'Charges of neglect could be brought against any parent if 
their young children are found on the streets in the midst of a civil 
disturbance.’

Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan described the rioting as ‘senseless criminality on a scale unprecedented in my career’.

He added: ‘These people have nothing to 
protest against – no sense of injustice or any spark led to this. We 
were overwhelmed. We had to draw resources from all over the North West 
to be able to ensure that we could protect life and property.’

Graham Stringer, Labour MP for Blackley and Broughton, said police had questions to answer. ‘This was predicted,’ he added. ‘The police knew it was coming. It was co-ordinated by well-known criminals and gangsters. It wasn’t spontaneous.’

Chief Constable Peter Fahy issued 17 
CCTV photos of suspected looters. He said one had handed himself in 
after seeing his own picture on the force’s Facebook page.

Armies of volunteers with brooms joined dozens of glaziers to begin the clear up yesterday. Last night police were stopping and 
searching teenagers and taking pictures of them as they made their way 
into the city, then ordering them home.

The rioting was the worst in the city 
since the 1981 Moss Side riot, in which a 1,000-strong mob besieged a 
police station and an officer was shot in the leg with a crossbow.

An officer was injured as his police station came under attack from youths in Washington, County Durham. The six rioters also set a patrol car alight.

The officer was treated in hospital after he was hit by shards of flying glass when the yobs threw a brick through the station window at 3am yesterday.

Two youths aged 17 and 19 were arrested in connection with the arson attack.Northumbria Police had sent several of their riot officers to London to help tackle the worst of the violence, but insisted this had not affected policing in the area.

On Tuesday night, trouble also spilled over into West Yorkshire as ‘copycat’ mobs smashed their way into a supermarket, shops and a doctors’ surgery in Huddersfield.

Five men aged between 17 and 20 were arrested after ‘pockets’ of violence broke out. One gang broke into a medical centre and a working men’s club where they stole cash machines.

Fire crew were also lured to a bus shelter, which had been set alight, where young men pelted them with stones and bottles. A mob also managed to break into Asda but were forced to abandon five televisions in the car park after they triggered the alarms.

A 19-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of encouraging  violent disorder after posting an invitation to a riot in Wakefield on Facebook.

And in Harehills, Leeds, a group also set fire to a van and attempted to stop vehicles from passing.
