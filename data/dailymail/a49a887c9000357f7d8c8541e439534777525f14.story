Jen Arnold, the star of reality TV show Little Couple, bravely shared a candid picture from her hospital room as she began her second day of inpatient chemotherapy on Friday.

The 39-year-old Houston-based neonatologist posted a snap shot on her Twitter page which showed her with no hair - a side-effect of the treatment she has been receiving since her shock diagnosis.

The mother-of-two is fighting a rare form of cancer, but did her best to stay upbeat in her message to fans.

'Day2 inpatient chemo- sleeping a lot, liking new anti nausea med this time, & looking to get home today! #GetWellJen,' she wrote.

She also told her fans that her chemotherapy had been postponed for a week because of low blood counts, but said the 'silver lining' was that she was able to have 'a better Xmas' with her family.

She certainly made the most of it, baking cookies with her son Will, 3, and daughter Zoey, 2, while her husband Bill Klein cooked an Italian feast for Christmas Eve.

She also shared pictures of her boy enjoying his presents on Christmas morning. 

The Houston neonatologist broke the news about her diagnosis earlier this month after she and husband, who both have dwarfism caused by a genetic condition, brought their second adopted child home to Texas.

Arnold, who has been wearing a wig, detailed the terrifying moment that she learned something was wrong in an interview with  People magazine.

'There are moments I feel just 
terrible,' she told the publication. 'I can't believe it is happening. Other times, I
 feel like this is just a bump in the road.'

The couple adopted son, Will, from China and they were in India to bring home their new daughter Zoey in October when Arnold began bleeding.

Desperate to stay with her daughter but feeling increasingly faint, Arnold made the difficult decision to return home.

Once back in the U.S., she was diagnosed with stage 3 choriocarcincoma, a cancer sparked by a non-viable pregnancy she had suffered.

Her fertility issues have been well documented on the show, and she was shocked when she became pregnant in August - although she said she was not surprised that an ultrasound showed the baby had no heartbeat.

'I had figured it wasn't going to be viable,' she told People magazine.

The
 embryo was removed but cells were left behind and sparked the 
quick-growing cancer. She began intensive chemotherapy while her husband
 was still in India.

But 
the mass in her uterus failed to respond to the chemo and grew four 
times its size - and then three tumors appeared in her lungs.

'Sometimes I think, "Seriously? Really? How can this be happening?"' she told People.

Doctors were forced to give her a hysterectomy - which they saw as their last resort because of Arnold's small ariway.

'We wanted to avoid surgery in her case because of her shortened airway and the difficulties she has had in the past with surgeries,' said Dr. Concepcion R. Diaz-Arrastia from Baylor College of Medicine.

'But we felt we had no choice. The disease was not responding to chemotherapy. We had to do this in order to save her life.'

Choriocarcinoma is a fast-growing form of cancer in the uterus that develops in women who are pregnant.It can occur after a normal pregnancy and it is possible for a healthy baby to grow at the same time.The cancer is most often caused by a hydatidiform mole, which is a tumor resulting from over-production of the tissue that is supposed to develop into the placenta - the organ that grows during pregnancy to feed the fetus.Even after the mass is removed from the uterus, the abnormal cells can continue to grow and turn into cancer - as it did in Arnold's case.Choriocarcinoma is an uncommon, but very often curable. Most women whose cancer has not spread can be cured and will still be able to have children.One symptom is vaginal bleeding in a woman who recently had a hydatidiform mole or pregnancy, and chemotherapy is the main type of treatment.A hysterectomy and radiation therapy are rarely needed.

Doctors were also faced with the issue of her size because they were unaware of how much chemotherapy to give her.

'I called oncologists in Los Angeles, Baltimore, New York, Houston,' Dr. Arrastia said, 'and no one had experience with treating this type of cancer in a person with skeletal dysplasia. It was a very rare cancer, rare that it was found in a little person â€¦ a very rare situation.'

Now doctors have upped her dosage and hope she will not suffer an infection that will set her back. If this is the case, doctor say her prognosis looks good.

'The treatment is rough,' Arnold said. 'But I have a chance of being cured. I just have to push through it.'

Although she said she was ready to 
battle through the cancer treatments, a tweet from Ms Arnold's husband earlier this month suggested she was feeling frail.

Mr
 Klein tweeted: 'My darling wife released today that she is currently 
battling a form of cancer. Prayers are welcome, hugs are not due to her 
weakened state.'

Arnold's battle against cancer after welcoming Zoey home will be shared with fans on future episodes of The Little Couple.

The couple met through an online dating 
website for little people and married in 2009. Mr Klein says he first 
saw his wife when she was 10 and they were both having surgery at the 
same hospital.

The TLC 
series The Little Couple has documented their desire to start a family. 
It has so far spanned five seasons and will continue to chronicle their 
lives she Jen fights the disease.

The
 couple decided to adopt because Jen's bone-growth disorder meant 
pregnancy was not advised for the 3ft 2in doctor and surrogacy failed.

The couple first adopted their son, 
Will, who was born in China. They welcomed him to their home in April 
after going to get him on a two-week trip to China featured on the show.

Both of the children they chose to adopt have dwarfism, and the couple 
of spoken of how their own experiences led to them wanting to help 
children with the same condition.
