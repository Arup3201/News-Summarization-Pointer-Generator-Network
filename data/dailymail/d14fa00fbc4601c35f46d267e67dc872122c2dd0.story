When you've had an octagon announcer introduce you for over 10 years, any old regular MC just wont do for your big day.

It was only fitting then, that Manchester's UFC star Michael Bisping and his Australian bride, Rebecca, were given a UFC style introduction on their wedding day.

The couple strode into their reception at the Rancho Las Lomas in Orange County, California, after a suspense filled, booming introduction by UFC's official octagon announcer, Bruce Buffer.Scroll down for video

Manchester's UFC fighter Michael Bisping, 34, had an octagon announcer introduce him and his bride on their wedding day last week

UFC's official octagon announcer, Bruce Buffer, had the honour of introducing the couple on the day that they tied the knot, amusing crowds with his well practiced animated movements

Keeping it simple and respectable, Mr Buffer started off by presenting the bride to the wedding guest.

'Standing five feet, six inches tall she has trained for this day for 15 years, hailing from Adelaide Australia...Rebecca!'

But it was the announcement of the groom that got the crowds laughing as Mr Buffer leaned in and roared his entrance.

'Today he is a lover not a fighter!' The 34-year-old's introduction was certainly a memorable one as wedding guests laughed along to the MC's japes

Mr Bisping shared some snaps of the big day on his social media accounts, thanking those 'who attended and made it so memorable'

The veteran announcer for UFC events was an audience-pleaser at the wedding, embracing the newly weds as they entered the reception

'The UFC Octagon warrior, who is now entering the true fighting arena of champions called marriage.

'Standing six feet, one inch tall and weighing in at whatever he wants as today he is a lover not a fighter.

'Presenting the pride of Manchester England, the one the only Michael "the count" Bisping!'

The 34-year-old martial arts star and his bride soon entered beaming from ear to ear to give their overqualified MC a quick embrace.

Mr Bisping also shared his wedding day joy with his social media followers, posting a range of photos to his Instagram account from the big day.
