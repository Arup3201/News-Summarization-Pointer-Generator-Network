A friend of the man associated with the ALS ice bucket challenge died early Saturday morning after diving off a Massachusetts wharf.

The Nantucket Police Department said in a release that 27-year-old Corey Griffin was reported missing at 2am.

'[A witness] stated Griffin had jumped off 
the Juice Guys building [...] into the water where he floated to the 
surface,' the release said. 'Griffin then went under water again not 
resurfacing.'

The day before, Griffin 'had just raised $100,000 for ALS in honor of his friend, Pete Frates,' according to The Boston Globe.

Victim: Corey Griffin died early Saturday morning and had jumped off a Nantucket wharf

Charitable: In addition to raising money for ALS, Griffin was reportedly involved with Boston's Children's Hospital

Frates - an ex-baseball player who discovered he had ALS two years ago - has become the face of the ALS ice bucket challenge, The Globe noted. Thousands of people have uploaded videos of themselves talking about ALS before pouring buckets on themselves.

Robert Griffin told the newspaper his son Corey told him of his fundraising success and 'was the happiest guy in the word. He called me last night and told me he was in paradise.'

Griffin also said his son 'was so happy to be able to help [Frates.]'

Police said Griffin was pulled out of the water by an off-duty lifeguard and hospitalized, but declared dead at 3am.

Griffin, who is survived by his parents and two siblings, was also involved in philanthropic events associated with Boston's Children's Hospital, The Globe reported.

'He lived life to the fullest and everybody loved him. And every time he walked into a room, he put a smile on everybody’s face.'
