Connor Cruise has formed a deep relationship with fellow Scientologist Kirstie Alley’s daughter Lillie Parker.

The 20-year-old has been comforting Lillie after her childhood sweetheart and fiance Nick Trela was killed in a motorcycle accident last November.

Heartbroken Lillie has called Connor her ‘best friend’ and the pair have met up in New York and Los Angeles with the blessing of Tom Cruise and Kirstie, who are also best friends and committed Scientologists.

The Church has been doing damage control ever since the Going Clear documentary was premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last week, but that has only brought Scientology celebrities closer.

After Nick was hit by a car while riding his motorbike in Los Angeles nearly three months ago, Lillie has struggled to recover until Connor swept her off her feet.

Both Connor and Lillie have a lot in common: educated at the same Scientology school, adopted at a young age by Hollywood stars, and, most importantly, are staunch Scientologists.

They’ve both completed Church courses including one on leadership and competence on the huge Scientology cruise ship called Freewinds.

Lillie’s heartbreak has caused them to grow much closer. On 9 January, they met up in New York and went straight to a hotel for deep and meaningful chats. Connor said in one message: ‘Real Talk. Brutal.’

They even have nicknames for each other - Connor is ‘Golden Eagle’ and she is ‘Von Strut’.

Two days later, they met up with mother Kirstie for her birthday, and along with fellow Scientologists including Lillie’s mentor Kim Joyce, enjoyed hot stone massages at the trendy urban NY retreat The Red Door Girl.

Lillie posted a picture of herself and Connor in a clench at the spa.

Later on that evening they went out for drinks and Lillie was pictured draped over Connor with a loving arm around his chest.

When Connor had to leave two days later to DJ in Panama, the pair sent loving messages to each other on Twitter. 

Lillie started it off by saying: ‘missing you already’, then she followed it up with another message, adding: ‘good morning Connor… miss you, thank you for being there for all of us… love you.’ Connor responded: ‘miss you too!!!!! much love!’

On 17 January, four days later, it was Connor’s turn to celebrate his birthday and he got a message from Lillie saying: ‘happy birthday to my best friend.’

Connor met Lillie at the Scientology school The Delphian Academy in Oregon and became friends with her mother Kirstie.

While his sister Isabella moved to the UK to complete studies, Connor forged a career as a dance DJ, encouraged by a bizarre mentor in former Cheers star Kirstie, who started DJ-ing as DJ Lil’ Buttercup four years ago.

Connor would often meet up with Kirstie either at her house in LA, Tom’s pad on Torreyson Drive in Beverly Hills, or at the Scientology Celebrity Centre on Franklin Avenue in Hollywood. They’ve posted pictures of some of their visits online like their meet up at the celeb center in August.

She visited Connor when he got a new dog last year and he calls Kirstie his ‘Spirit Animal’, a special term to use when you revere or look up to someone’s life and achievements.

This also isn’t the first time that Connor has grown close to high profile Scientology families with beautiful daughters. 

Respective parents Tom and Kirstie are two of the highest ranking Church members and have completed Operating Thetan 7, which is only one step away from having the ‘full knowledge.’

Kirstie talked about OT7 to radio DJ Howard Stern last month, saying: ‘It’s an awareness level, it's an achievement… I think that people need to always, no matter what path they choose, the goal I hope would be to become more and more aware and less insane.’

She also revealed that her children are Scientologists, saying: ‘It was their choice… it really helped them a lot so that's good.’

A former Scientology pal Tiziano Lugli was declared a ‘Suppressive Person’ after leaving and had to disconnect from a close friend - Connor.

He says: ’[Connor and Isabella] are so protected. You can't live a normal life if you're Tom Cruise's son, especially being in Scientology. There are strict ethics around them. They have staff dedicated to Tom Cruise.’

He claimed that his last contact with Connor was on Facebook. Lugli said he wrote: 'Man, you rock. It's a dangerous commodity to still be friends with us. Keep your head up high and I will see you up the line, my friend.'

Then Connor replied: 'Ha, ha, ha, ha, I know.' And then deleted his entire Facebook page.

The likes of Tom and Kirstie have closed ranks since the furor over the anti-Church documentary Going Clear. 

Kirstie even took to Twitter to air her views, saying: ‘Asking a defected Scientologist about Scientology is like asking a KKK member to represent the views of white people on blacks...pure s***.'

Tony Ortega, who stars in the Going Clear documentary and went to the Sundance Film Festival for the documentary explained more on the relationships between celebrity Scientologists.

He said: ‘There does seem to be some "circling of the wagons" going on. Connor has gotten very close to Kirstie and her family, and with his sister Isabella seemingly back in LA, that only seems to confirm that Tom's children are as dedicated to Scientology as ever.

‘There's a social element to Scientology that's important to keep in mind. Separate from the courses and fundraisers and other official church events, Scientologists often surround themselves with other Church members - and Isabella and Connor have been prime examples of this.’

Isabella Cruise has now finished her hairdressing studies in London.

It was reported in December that she’d completed her 12-month diploma course at the prestigious Sassoon Academy in central London.

But we can reveal that Isabella, 21, then went on to do a post-graduate course in coloring and cutting, which was a 12-week program and finished last month.

Since returning to Los Angeles for the Christmas holidays, she’s now got little reason to return to London.

All her Scientology friends have finished their own university courses and have either moved back to the US, France or begun working at the British Scientology HQ in Saint Hill, West Sussex.

The friends on her hairdressing course have also mostly jumped ship and returned to their respective countries. 

As the fees for the course runs into tens of thousands, most students are either from the US or south east Asia.

The 21-year-old was pictured alongside the other students after being awarded the Sassoon Post-Graduate Diploma, which is highly respected in the hairdressing world.
