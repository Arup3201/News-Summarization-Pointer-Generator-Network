A 72-year-old man with advanced Alzheimer's has been shot dead by a homeowner after he rang the bell at the stranger's house when he became lost and confused in the middle of the night.

Ronald Westbrook rang the doorbell of a home at 4am on Wednesday after wandering around in the dark for almost four hours in rural Walker County, Georgia. He had walked around three miles from his home by the time he approached the door.

The shooter was identified as Joe Hendrix, of Chattanooga, Tennessee, according to Sheriff Steve Wilson said.

Ronald Westbrook, a 72-year-old with advanced Alzheimer's, was shot dead by a homeowner after he spent four hours wandering around in the dark and banged on the man' door in rural Walker County, Georgia

Mr Westbrook rang the door bell and turned the door handle of the home in the new development where Hendrix had just moved in with his fianc√©e.

The woman, who has not been identified, called 911 and was on the phone with a dispatcher when Hendrix confronted the elderly man in the yard with a 40-caliber handgun.

Mr Westbrook, an Air Force veteran, did not respond to the commands that Hendrix issued to him because Alzheimer's Disease has left the72-year-old practically mute.

Hendrix fired four shots with one bullet striking Mr Westbrook in the chest and killing him.

The victim's body was removed from the scene at 10.30am on Wednesday.

It is unlikely that Hendrix will be charged with any crime, according to The Chattanoogan.
