Cristiano Ronaldo will not be rested by Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti, despite wearing an ice pack on his troublesome left knee after being substituted in the 75th minute of Portugal’s defeat by France.

Ronaldo will finish the season with an incredible 73 goals if he continues scoring at his current rate and Ancelotti seems determined to play him as often as possible.

Ancelotti told Spanish radio station Cope: ‘It is not easy rotating Ronaldo. The statistics say that when he plays he nearly always scores. It is almost as though by selecting him the game starts at 1-0 in our favour.’

Ronaldo has scored 13 goals in six games which is more than most other teams have managed in the whole of Europe. 

Only six European clubs have a better scoring average than Real Madrid’s No 7 with his 2.16 goals per game bettered only by his own club Real Madrid, Chelsea, Barcelona, Benfica, Marseille and Valencia according to figures published on Tuesday in Marca.

The one-man team gave Real Madrid fans a fright at the weekend as he put a large ice-pack on his knee but under the orders of Portugal team doctor Juan Carlos Noronha the treatment was just standard precautionary protocol.

The measure is designed to prevent inflammation of the left knee and ward off any reoccurrence of the tendinitis problems he suffered last season meaning he lost the Spanish Cup final.

Ronaldo has been in sensational form this season, scoring 13 goals in six matches for Real Madrid

Gareth Bale has also been less than 100 per cent on international duty. The Real Madrid winger was feeling his back after his country’s 0-0 draw at the weekend and was then kicked all around Cardiff City Stadium in a 2-1 win over Cyprus.

But Ancelotti also sees Bale as fundamental in his plans this season. He wants the Real Madrid forward doing even more work in a Madrid engine room still struggling to come to terms with the departure of Xabi Alonso and Angel Di Maria.

Ancelotti has admitted that to fit all his attacking players into the team the Welshman cannot play quite as high up the pitch as last season.

He said: 'Bale comes back a little bit more than Ronaldo to make a four in midfield. He is in even better condition this year than he was at the same time last year.'
