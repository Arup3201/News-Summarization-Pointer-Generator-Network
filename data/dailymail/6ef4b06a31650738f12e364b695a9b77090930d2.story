Gareth Southgate has reaffirmed his commitment to the FA by signing a 12-month contract extension.

The England Under 21 head coach, who has guided his squad to this summer European Championships, had 18 months remaining on his current deal.

Those terms would have expired in the middle of qualification for Euro 2017 and the FA were keen to extend his deal beyond that date to incorporate the tournament in its entirety.

Southgate took over from Stuart Pearce in August 2013 and has overseen a dramatic improvement, with the Under 21s winning 12 of the 14 matches he has been in charge for, suffering only one defeat in a friendly to France.

They will warm-up for Euro 2015 with friendlies in March against Czech Republic and Germany at the Riverside in Middleborough.

Southgate said: 'I am enjoying my work at The FA and with St. George’s Park coming to life with innovation and development across our football disciplines I believe we now have some solid foundations in place.

'England DNA is evolving but anyone who has seen our development teams play – including the Under 21s – will know that many of the principles can already been seen in the way we go about our work.

'Whilst I am certainly happy with the direction we are heading and the progress made so far, we have enormous work ahead of us to raise the level to where we would like to be. It is a big challenge, but an exciting one.'

FA Technical Director Dan Ashworth added: 'Gareth is an outstanding individual to work alongside and I am happy to see him commit further to his work with the Under 21s and to football development at The FA.

'We are looking forward to the European Championship this summer and testing our young players against Europe's elite. With Gareth in place we will hope to qualify for the 2017 European Championship to continue our players' education and development.

'Gareth’s close working relationship with Roy Hodgson is certainly helping the transition of our players through to the senior team.'
