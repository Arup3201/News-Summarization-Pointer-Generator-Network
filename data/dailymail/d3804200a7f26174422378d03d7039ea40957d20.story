Angel di Maria showed a glimpse of things to come as he made three and scored one in Argentina's win over World Cup winners Germany.

Manchester United's record signing laid on goals for Sergio Aguero, Erik Lamela and Federico Fernandez before scoring himself as the Rio runners up took a form of revenge 52 days on from Mario Gotze's extra-time winner in Brazil.

Five of the six goals in Dusseldorf came from Premier League players, with Andre Schurrle scoring for Germany before a second consolation from Gotze.

But Di Maria was the star and his outside-of-the-boot through ball allowed new Manchester rival Aguero to put the visitors ahead after 21 minutes, volleying home from the edge of the six-yard box.

Then Tottenham winger Lamela was the recipient of another brilliant Di Maria ball which he calmly guided into the top corner with Manuel Neuer left a spectator.

And within two minutes of the restart after half-time new Swansea centre back Fernandez made it three, nodding home a Di Maria free-kick at the far post. 

Finally the £60million man capped his performance by chipping past substitute keeper Roman Weidenfeller from a tight angle to humiliate the world champions on their first home outing since the summer triumph. 

Schurrle and Gotze, the architects of Germany's winner in the Maracana, scored to make the result more respectable but Argentina were easy winners despite some late pressure. 

And with Di Maria having missed the June final through injury it left Argentina fans wondering what might have been.

'It can't be revenge,' Germany coach Joachim Low said. 'You can't bring the final back.'

With Lionel Messi absent due to a right leg injury, Di Maria assumed the instigator's role, setting up Aguero in the 21st minute, Lamela's outstanding volley in the 40th, and Federico Fernandez's headed goal two minutes after the interval.

'Di Maria showed why he is one of the five best players in the world,' Argentina coach Gerardo Martino said.

Di Maria, who completed his move to Manchester United from Real Madrid last week, crowned his performance in the 50th minute with a chip over Germany's substitute keeper Weidenfeller, after a great run set up by Argentina captain Javier Mascherano.

Schurrle pulled one back from a rebound two minutes later before Gotze, who scored the winning goal in the World Cup final, made it 4-2 with a deflected shot in the 78th. 

Germany made seven changes to their side. Captain Philipp Lahm, fellow defender Per Mertesacker and record scorer Miroslav Klose all retired after the final, while coach Loew also had to contend with a host of injuries.

'Actually I can't make any accusations against the team, they had never played together like that before,' Low said.

Martino, who took over from Alejandro Sabella after the final, had to do without Messi on his debut. He did, however, have Di Maria - who missed the title match with an injury.

'We would have beaten them even if Di Maria played on July 13,' Low said.

Martino said Di Maria made himself 'more prominent' than he had been at the World Cup.

The attacking midfielder showed his intention early on with a run before Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer emerged to snuff out the danger.

Neuer captained the side in the absence of the injured Bastian Schweinsteiger, who was named as Lahm's successor on Tuesday.

Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero then got the better of Mario Gomez in a one on one at the other end.

Gomez, back in the side after missing out on the World Cup due to fitness concerns, missed three chances to score with the goal at his mercy. The Fiorentina striker was whistled by fans after his last miss and again when he was substituted.

'He was missing for around seven months. For me it was important to see how he moved, and that he had the chances,' Loew said. 'Of course he still needs a bit of time to get back to form after such a long time out with injury.'

Di Maria sent in an exquisite cross with the outside of his left boot for Aguero to open the scoring with a simple tap-in after a lack of concentration in the German defense.

Lamela made it 2-0 five minutes before the interval with a rocket of a volley to the top left corner from Di Maria's deep cross.

Fernandez' header from Di Maria's cross gave substitute goalkeeper Weidenfeller no chance, and a rout looked on the cards when Di Maria capped his great solo run with a delightful chip over the goalkeeper.

Schurrle and Gotze responded and Marco Reus struck the post for the home side, which couldn't muster a comeback - but still has the World Cup.
