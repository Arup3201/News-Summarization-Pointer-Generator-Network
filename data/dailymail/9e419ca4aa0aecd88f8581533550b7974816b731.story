Sir Alex Ferguson beat his previous mark on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? bagging the Manchester United Foundation £50,000 - but it could have been more had his knowledge of bricks been up to scratch.

The former Manchester United manager appeared on the special live show, the last ever of the long-running series, with Eamonn Holmes, an avid Manchester United fan.

Holmes and Ferguson had previously appeared on the show together in 2004, where they won £32,000. And Fergie, who has a long habit of winning, was determined to beat his previous mark.

Winners: Sir Alex Ferguson and Eamonn Holmes won £50,000 for the Manchester United Foundation

Gamble: Answering this question correctly would have taken them to £150,000, but their wrong answer dropped them back to £50,000

Larks: Carol Voderman and Caroline Quentin also appeared on the special live show

Disappointment: The pair previously appeared on the show in 2004 and won £32,000

The questions Fergie and Eamonn Holmes had to answer:

£500 - Complete this line from Wham's classic song, 'Last Christmas, I gave you...'? My heart (correct)

£1,000 - On Sunday, who was crowned 2013 'X Factor' winner? Sam Bailey (correct)

£2,000 - Which of these completes the name of an English League football club in Sheffield?Wednesday (correct)

£5000 - What new minimum hourly wage for over-21s was introduced in the UK in October?£6.31 (correct, but used 'ask the audience')

£10,000 - Notching up more than 21 million copies, which of these has sold the greatest number of cookery books in the UK?Delia Smith (correct)

£20,000 - Margaret Thatcher regularly had 'Carmen' listed in her daily diary, indicating an appointment with her what?Hairdresser (correct, but used 'phone a friend')

£50,000 - What has been the most common surname in Britain since civil records began?Smith (correct, but used '50/50'. Then gained 'switch')

£75,000 - Which of these creatures has three hearts? Octopus (used 'switch)

- In which of these countries do residents pay half the usual amount of tax in December so they have more money for Christmas?Norway (correct)

£150,000 - What name is given to the indentation on one side of a common brick? Frog (wrong, dropped back to £50,000)

The Scot admitted to Chris Tarrant before the questions started that he was still sore at only winning £32,000 last time.

'I was devastated,' he told Tarrant. 'We looked great at £64k, three lifelines, but we couldn't do it.'

He also admitted to being a quiz fan, with the Ferguson family regularly taking part in family quizzes at Christmas.

'It's very competitive. We get one of the grandson's to do the questions.'

Ferguson and Holmes had a strong start
rattling through the first few questions to get to £10,000 in no time. 
However, they did have to burn a lifeline on the fourth question, as 
they didn't know what the recent increase in minimum wage for over 21s 
had changed to.

They asked the audience and went with the 83 per cent majority, who answered correctly, saying £6.31.

The
pair ran into a bit more trouble thereafter, however. They confidently 
answered that Delia Smith had sold the record amount of cookbooks in the
UK, but on their next two questions they used a further two lifelines.

The
£20,000 question asked: 'Margaret Thatcher regularly had a 'Carmen' 
listed in her daily diary, indicating an appointment with her what?'

They had to ring Jon Lawrence, a 
journalist at the Daily Telegraph, who said the answer was her 
hairdresser, although he 'wasn't sure'.

That
was correct and so was the answer to the next question, which asked 
what was the most common surname in the UK since records began.

Out of Jones, Taylor, Smith and Brown, they beleived it was either Jones or Smith but decided to use their 50/50.

Easy: The first question raised a smile from Fergie, and both answered it quickly

Secret fan? Ferguson also knew the answer to question two, about the recent X-Factor show

That's not fair: The pair were even asked a football question

Slightly tougher: Ferguson and Holmes didn't know that the minimum wage had been increased to (B) £6.31

Delia fan: The former Manchester United boss knew that Delia Smith had sold a record number of books

Phone a friend: The duo had to ask a journalist to give them the answer to the question about Margaret Thatcher

50/50: Answering this question correctly meant they were guaranteed to win at least £50,000

No answer: They had to use their switch lifeline to get out of answering this toughie

This didn't help as it brought up the two names they had conferred over.

However, they eventually went with Smith, which took them to the total of £50,000, an amount that became their new minimum and added a lifeline, the switch, which allows for a change in question.

They had to use it on their next go, not knowing that an Octopus has three hearts.

The next question seemed equally tough, asking about December tax laws in Europe.

Delight: Their guess of Norway took Ferguson and Holmes up to £75,000 - Chris Tarrant was also delighted

Walking away: Sir Alex and Eamonn Holmes leave the stage after bagging £50,000

Ferguson and Holmes took a guess that 
Norway reduce their tax in December so their citizens have more to spend
at Christmas, which was right, taking their total to £75,000.

But they came unstuck on the next one with their big gamble.

The question was worth £150,000 if answered correctly but would put them down to £50,000 if answered wrong.

Despite a long conference they believed a newt, rather than a frog, was on one side of a common brick.

Despite their gamble the pair were pleased with their earnings, knowing that they had beaten their total from 2004 and raised a huge amount for charity.
