A cat that was stranded on top of a utility pole in Montana for nearly 48 hours in below-freezing temperatures was rescued today by a local energy company.

Neighbors said the female cat might have run up the pole in Helena on Friday after being chased by dogs. 

Just after 10am this morning, NorthWestern Energy announced that it was working on a plan to save the stranded cat, which doesn't have a name, but it is described as the 'friendlier one of the bunch'.

The cat belongs to 11-year-old Ryilee Stratton, who is an animal lover and has several cats and dogs. 

She said that she wanted her cat to be returned to the ground and that it might be hungry.

'That's the only cat that's really nice to anybody and the other ones are kind of big and mean,' she told KXLH on Saturday.

The energy company was proceeding with caution over the weekend because they were concerned with safety and how the cat might react.

NorthWestern said the pole had a high-voltage and the company wanted to keep its employees and the cat safe. 

Temperatures in Helena this weekend reached as low as 26 degrees and hit highs of 61F. 

A crew from the energy company brought a bucket truck to the utility pole on Sunday and the cat was brought to the ground by 12.15pm.
