A mansion on a super-expensive street nicknamed 'Billionaire's row' has become the UK's most valuable repossession after going on the market for £30million.

The house, named Dryades, is located in the centre of The Bishops Avenue, a leafy street in North London.

But the property, owned by a Pakistani political dynasty, has been seized by the bank after a lengthy High Court battle.

Gated: The mansion, on one of London's priciest streets, is set to be knocked down to make way for a replacement

Location: Dryades, outlined in red, has an acre and a half of gardens

The 8,000square-foot home has now been put on the market by the bank for a staggering £30million, but plans are already in motion to knock the existing house down and replace it with a giant new home.

Planning permission has been granted by Barnet Council for a 46,000square-foot replacement, which could more than triple the present value of the property.

The proposed home would boast 21 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms and 12 reception rooms when completed.

It will also have an acre and a half of gardens, despite being minutes from the busiest parts of London.

The replacement for Dryades will have a staggering 63-metre frontage, and plans are in place for staff quarters, an orangery and a huge centrally-positioned staircase which is reached by walking through a grand vestibule.

Other facilities will include an underground level containing a car park, swimming pool, sauna, gym, steam room, billiards room, cinema, bar and bowling alley.

Its value could approach £100 million mark when completed - making it one of the country’s most valuable new residences.

The property was bought for around £12,000,000 in 2005 by the family of Pakistan’s former privatisation minister Senator Waqar Ahmed Khan as they looked to invest in the London property market.

In 2007 it was used to secure a £50million loan with Deutsche Bank, but a lengthy ‘debt and possession’ dispute between both parties resulted in the family losing the home earlier this year.

The receivers, Eddisons, has appointed the Knight Frank estate agency to sell Dryades, with the property advertised for £29,500,000.

It is currently boarded up and its gardens are unmaintained.

'Exceptional value': Estate agents Knight Frank said that the property was worth much more because it is possible to build on it

First among billionaires: If built, the proposed mansion would be the largest house on 'Billionaire's Row'

Grant Alexson, head of Knight Frank’s Hampstead office, called Dryades 'an exceptional opportunity'.

He said: 'The house, which is currently quite modest, is set in 1.5acres of prime land on The Bishops Avenue.

'The value is in the planning permission. A piece of land like this is worth a lot more if you can build on it.

'It would be the largest home on The Bishops Avenue and one of the largest new homes in the UK.

'It is an exceptional opportunity to buy one of the finest pieces of land on The Bishops Avenue and it is likely to appeal to an international client.

'It has just come onto the market and there is already a lot of interest.'

Court battle: Waqar Ahmed Khan went to the High Court over his £50million loan from Deutsche Bank

The £30million property in north London was repossessed after a pitched legal battle between a senior Pakistani politician and one of the world's most powerful banks.

Senator Waqar Ahmed Khan, a former minister in the Pakistani government, is a member of the Khan political dynasty which has included four senators serving at the same time.

They took a £50million loan with Deutsche Bank against the value of the house. They planned to use the money to redeveloped Dryades, and also to buy another property on The Bishops Avenue.

But the bank claimed the loan had fallen into default after the value of the property sank below the outstanding value of the loan, leading to a battle in court to reclaim the money.

As well as claiming Dryades from the family, Deutsche Bank also sought possession of a portfolio of six flats in Knightsbridge, central London, worth a total of £40million.

The family attempted to turn the tables on the bank, however, by claiming that they had withheld some of the money which they had agreed to lend.

This, according to the Khans, meant they had been unable to press on with redevelopments and make back enough money to repay the loan.

They also claimed the a 'trusted' Deutsche Bank adviser had come to them with the loan proposal in the first place.

However, the High Court judge in the case, Mr Justice Hamblen, rejected the defence and the bank won its right to pursue the Khan's for the outstanding loan, plus substantial interest.
