A male pilot has died after a light plane he was flying crashed into a home in Melbourne's south-east.

Police believe the single-engine light aircraft could have been 'homemade' as pieces of debris have been found along the foreshore - south of the crash which occurred near The Strand in Chelsea  at about 1.30pm on Tuesday. 

Witnesses told police they heard the plane's engine 'stall' just before it began to plummet out of the sky from what is believed to be a low height.

The pilot has been praised as 'brave' for his efforts to navigate the plane away from the nearby busy shopping district and a children's playground before eventually colliding with the side of a house which caused the blaze.

Andrew Delaney, from the Country Fire Authority, said the pilot appeared to have bravely directed his plane away from a nearby busy shopping strip and children's park.

'(It's a) very brave, very brave activity that he conducted,' he said.

'If you have a look he's missed the power lines so he's done a very good job and missed houses really.'

'He's just collected a bit of the fence and pretty much guided his plane down the laneway.'

Mr Delaney said the plane's fuel caused the fire that lit up the fence and also set part of the house on fire.

Inspector Janine Denton has urged members of the public not to touch any of the debris that has been strewn throughout the area. 

Police believe they know the identity of the deceased pilot but it is yet to be confirmed. 

A woman, who was in one of the houses at the time of the crash, has escaped with minor injuries. 

The plane struck a house and damaged two vehicles while erupting into flames on impact.

Inspector Janine Denton said the situation could have been much worse with the crash happening close to a busy shopping district

One man said he saw a burst of flames when the plane crashed.

'There was a mass of flames coming out, a mass of smoke - black - coming from it,' he told Fairfax Radio.

The pilot may have been trying to make an emergency landing, another witness said. 

Witness Ashleigh Benson saw the light plane drop steeply in a 'nosedive' before it crashed.

'This big thing of smoke came out, you could see it from about 10 minutes up the road,' Ms Benson said.

Megan Johnston was working in her office when she heard the plane go down.

'I heard the plane engine starting to splutter and it sounded very close,' Ms Johnston told AAP.

'Then I obviously heard a massive explosion.'

She ran around the corner to see an elderly woman standing in shock outside her house, which was starting to catch on fire.
