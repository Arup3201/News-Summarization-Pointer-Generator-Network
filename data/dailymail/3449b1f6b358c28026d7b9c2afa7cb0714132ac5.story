There's nothing more awkward than rocking up to an event in the same outfit as someone else and luckily for the stars at Sunday night's Oscars, they managed to avoid such a mishap.

But for Jennifer Lopez and actor and director Robert Duvall's wife, Luciana Pedraza, it was a near miss.

Whilst the two stars didn't wear the exact same dress, the styles of their frocks were so similar, they may as well have.

Jennifer Lopez, let, and actor and director Robert Duvall's wife, Luciana Pedraza, right, looked strikingly similar in pretty peach gowns on the Oscars red carpet on Sunday night

The two red carpet beauties looked pretty in peach wearing strikingly similar gowns on the red carpet last night. 

Jennifer Lopez, 45, looked the vision of youth in a dazzling Elie Saab Haute Couture gown, which came complete with hand-embellished crystal detailing.

Pedraza, 43, meanwhile, looked remarkably similar to Lopez in a Jad Ghandor number.

Both gowns were slashed to the midriff, revealing ample cleavage, and came with showstopping tulle skirts. 

The duo even accessorised in sync, both carrying boxy clutches and wearing diamond drop earrings. 

Adhering to the red carpet trend for up 'dos, both ladies wore their brunette locks slicked back in a sophisticated style.

She may oozed glamour but Lopez's voluminous gown presented some technical difficulties of its own.

The  star suffered a bit of a train trip after presenting the Best Costume Award to The Grand Budapest Hotel's Milena Canonero with Chris Pine, but fortunately the Star Trek actor saved her from making an even more embarrassing misstep.

Jennifer's heels appeared to have gotten caught in the cascading material as the pair walked off the stage at The Dolby Theater in Hollywood, California.

Earlier in the evening, the singer-dancer-entrepreneur needed a helping hand from the valets when exiting her limousine. 

Speaking to Lara Spencer on the red carpet, Jennifer explained she has a tried and tested formula for walking the red carpet. She said: 'I knew it would be a challenge, but I like a challenge. I have a whole technique. I got this. I’m used to it. I’ve done it so many times.'
