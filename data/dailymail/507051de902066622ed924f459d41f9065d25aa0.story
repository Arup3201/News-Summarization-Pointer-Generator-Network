Michael Carberry says he has no problem with Kevin Pietersen following revelations that he was derided by his former England team-mate.

Sportsmail told earlier this week how Pietersen questioned whether the opener should be in the team behind his back while he batted and asked Jonny Bairstow across the room who else in county cricket the national team should be looking at instead. 

But Carberry insists the pair get on well and says he has never had 'any issues' with England's record run scorer.

He tweeted: 'Morning!!Just to set the record straight re:KP. Ive never had any issues with Kev. We have always got on well and still do'.

Carberry was England's second highest run scorer - behind Pietersen - in that fateful Ashes series Down Under but was dropped after the series.

The 34-year-old has not played a Test match since and it looks very unlikely he will add to his six caps.
