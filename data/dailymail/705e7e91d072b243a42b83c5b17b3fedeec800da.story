Ex-breakfast TV presenter and employment minister Esther McVey leads the charge

Two ministers dubbed the ‘yin and yang’ of Tory women are expected to be big winners in a wide-ranging reshuffle tomorrow.

Feisty employment minister Esther McVey and ice-cool schools minister Elizabeth Truss head possibly a dozen women in line for promotion as David Cameron shakes up his team for the last time before next year’s election.

Several long-serving male Cabinet ministers branded ‘the old lags’ will make way for new faces. The Prime Minister is determined to meet his target of one third of his ministers being female.

The reshuffle comes as a major Parliamentary report out today warns Westminster is still so sexist and out of touch that women are being put off from entering politics.

The all-party group for women in Parliament say radical steps are needed to make Westminster more female-friendly, given that only 22 per cent of MPs are women.

Mr Cameron told the inquiry: ‘Parliament needs to be more representative of our country – so we need more women in Parliament.’

But shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper claimed the Prime Minister had a ‘real blind spot’ over women and his shake-up was ‘too little, too late’.

Miss McVey may replace Ken Clarke as minister without portfolio and take a roving brief that would enable her to be one of the key Tory faces in next year’s election campaign. 

The Liverpudlian former GMTV presenter has been identified by strategists as one of the party’s most passionate and effective performers.

Miss Truss, by contrast, has emerged as potential future leadership candidate through her attention to detail and unflappable manner.

‘Esther and Liz are the yin and yang of the up-and-coming women,’ said one senior Conservative. ‘With Esther it’s all passion and instinct. She is like an unguided missile – you never know quite where she is headed. Liz, on the other hand, projects poise and control.

‘She is still young but people make the Thatcher comparison, and not just because she’s an education minister. There is a touch of the Thatcher steel.’ 

Other women likely to be promoted include Treasury minister Nicky Morgan, a protegee of Chancellor George Osborne, backbencher Priti Patel and Parliamentary aide Penny Mordaunt.

Margot James, Amber Rudd, Claire Perry, Harriett Baldwin and Nicola Blackwood are other women expected to advance.

Former culture secretary Maria Miller, who resigned in a row over her expenses earlier this year, said Mr Cameron had a ‘hugely rich talent pool’ of female MPs.

‘People like Harriett Baldwin, who was a leader in her field in the City before she came to Parliament; Margot James – a very successful businesswoman,’ she said.

The all-party report said the behaviour of some MPs in the House, particularly at Prime Minister’s Questions, was ‘raucous and ill-mannered’. 

Several women MPs ‘avoid Prime Minister’s Questions due to the testosterone-fuelled atmosphere in the chamber,’ the report added. 

It called for new powers for the Speaker of the Commons to be able to decline to call a badly-behaved MP for a named period.

Miss Cooper told Sky News’s Murnaghan programme that Mr Cameron has had four years to promote more women into senior positions.

‘There’s only three women in the Cabinet of between 20 and 30 people at the moment and I think this is going to look really like a last minute worry about votes,’ she added.

Senior sources also played down suggestions that Mr Cameron might opt at the 11th hour for a surprise woman candidate as Britain’s next EU commissioner.

An announcement on who is to be nominated for the coveted post is expected this week, in tandem with the Cabinet reshuffle.

The names of former policy chief Baroness Hogg, Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom and journalist Baroness Wheatcroft were linked to the role, following suggestions a woman might win a more influential portfolio as new EU boss Jean-Claude Juncker seeks to balance his team. 

He is said to want to create a new ‘commissioner for bureaucracy reduction’ – a post he might hand to the British nominee in a peacemaking gesture.

Home Secretary Theresa May’s name was floated by some, but allies say she would tell Mr Cameron ‘to take a running jump’ if offered the position.

There has been speculation that Mr Cameron might shift Education Secretary Michael Gove, following a series of public rows with colleagues and senior figures in education and poll numbers showing dismal levels of support for free schools.

However, it is not clear where Mr Gove could go, with more senior jobs occupied by ministers not expected to move.

Ministers heading for the exit door include chief whip Sir George Young, while Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, Welsh Secretary David Jones and leader of the Commons Andrew Lansley are all said to be vulnerable.
