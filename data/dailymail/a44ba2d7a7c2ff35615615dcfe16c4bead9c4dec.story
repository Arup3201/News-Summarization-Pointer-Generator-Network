Two British sisters who survived 18 hours in the Indian Ocean after the tour boat they were travelling on sank in rough seas have told how they chose not to join their fellow survivors in drinking urine and eating leaves to stay alive.

Backpackers Katherine Ostojic, 21, and her 19-year-old sister Alice, managed to sit on the overturned semi-submerged hull of the stricken vessel for ten hours after it got into difficulty off the island of Lombok.

However, after realising their chances of being rescued were becoming slimmer by the minute, they had no option but to join eight fellow survivors in swimming to an island on the horizon – a journey which took them eight hours.

It was there that some of the survivors drank their own urine and ate leaves to stay alive – although the sisters, who are both keen travellers, said they chose not to partake in doing so.

The group were eventually rescued by fishermen and all were given food and water before being flown to Bali. 

The rescue, along with an earlier rescue of 15 others, means 23 of the 25 people on board the rickety vessel have been saved from the disaster. A search is ongoing for two Spanish men who remain missing at sea after separating from the group when the boat capsized.

When back on the mainland, the girls were quick to send a string of emails to their mother Joan and her husband Peter to let them know they were safe and well.

In one they wrote: 'They have found everyone now. Such a relief. The boat sank in the middle of the night.

'We sat on its roof while it was semi-submerged for ten hours. Then swam eight hours to the shore before seeing the lights of some fishermen and getting them to pick us up.'

'N.B no urine was drunk and no leaves were eaten, at least not by us.'

Hello. In case the embassy haven't contacted yet, we were involved in the Indonesian boat sinking but are fine having swum to shore.

The British embassy in Denpasar are helping us.

Will contact you when we can.

Love Katherine and Alice

Monday 18/08/2014 from Katherine

They have found everyone now, such a relief. To sum up what happened because the press are wrong, the boat sank in the middle of the night, we sat on its roof while it was semi submerged for 10 hours, then swam for 8 hours to the shore before seeing the lights of some fishermen and getting them to pick us up.

Spent the night on an uninhabited active volcanic island with the fishermen who gave us food and water before we were taken back to a larger island.

Monday 18/08/14 from Alice

I don't know if you've heard already, but everyone from the boat has now been found and is safe on Sumbawa. We went to the British Consulate (they even picked us up from the airport!) to sort out some things, and we have to go to the Immigration Office tomorrow to check our passports are still working after getting wet. They were really helpful there and told us they'd follow up on the situation.

We're still planning to stay in Indonesia until our original flights home, since it's not possible to change them, but I think some downtime will be appreciated anyway. 

Their mother Joan, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, today told how relieved she was that they managed to survive the ordeal, which occurred overnight on Saturday as the tour boat was travelling to Komodo Island – a popular destination with tourists due to its Komodo dragons.

She said: 'They are only adequate swimmers, but they had life jackets on.

'I am very happy that they have been rescued and we are expecting to see them again in about a week's time.'

In fact, Mrs Ostojic, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, said the first she heard of the disaster was when she received the emails from her daughters.

She said: 'I'm glad I didn't know about it beforehand. It means I didn't have time to worry.

'The girls are fine but a little sunburnt. They have limited access to email, so we have not been able to get the full story.

Katherine (pictured on a previous trip) and her sister swam for eight hours to a volcanic island after the boat sank in rough seas on Saturday. They were later rescued by a passing fisherman who saw their lifejackets

'The girls had a lovely time climbing the Rinjani volcano on Lombok, and were on their way to see the Komodo dragon when the incident happened.

'They are fine, carrying on with their travels and they will be home on the weekend. I'm looking forward to seeing them both and hearing all about it.'

She also said that both daughters were concerned there had been insufficient safety measures on the boat and now want to help rally for improved safety.

'They are both eager that the Indonesian Government should take action to improve safety for passengers travelling on boats like theirs,' she added.

'They said there wasn't even a radio on board.'

The other rescued passengers included five Dutch, four Germans, three Italians, two each from Spain and New Zealand, and one each from France and Britain. Two Spanish remain missing at sea following the disaster

Alice, who is on a gap year, has spent the last five months travelling across the world and has visited New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos.

Her sister, a Bristol University student studying Aerospace Engineering, joined her for the last month of her travels after completing a summer course in space travel and geophysics in Austria.

The girls managed to save their money, debit cards and passports during the accident, but all their other belongings were lost at sea.

According to their emails, they will now enjoy some 'downtime' in Bali while sorting arrangements for their journey back to the UK at the weekend.
