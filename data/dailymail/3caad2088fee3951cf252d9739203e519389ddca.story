Six people are dead after two horrific chain-reaction crashes occurred just hours apart on Interstate 95 near Jacksonville, Florida.

The crashes happened late on Saturday in Flagler and St. Johns counties and closed southbound lanes of the major interstate through until Sunday morning.

Two people – a teen and a 56-year-old woman - were killed in a three-vehicle crash south of Palm Coast Parkway in Flagler County at 5.30pm on Saturday afternoon.

Several hours later, four more people were killed in an 11-vehcile crash, including three tractor trailer trucks, in St. Johns County.

The victims in the first crash have been named as Michael Smith, 17, of Jacksonville and Pamela Thor, 56, of St. Augustine.

Officials have not yet released the names of those killed in the second incident, reports The Florida-Times Union.

The first crash involved two pickup trucks and a car. Smith was a passenger in a Chevrolet 1500 pickup truck driven by Roy Roger White, 38, of Jacksonville who sustained minor injuries and was taken to Florida Hospital Flagler in Palm Coast.

Thor, who was driving a Honda Civic, died at the scene.

The other pickup truck, a Chevrolet Silverado, was driven by Michael Jeffrey Mervis, 53, who had a passenger, Kimberly Patricia Martinson, 47.

Four more people were killed in an 11-vehcile crash, including three tractor trailer trucks, in St. Johns County later on Saturday

Mervis wasn’t injured. Martinson sustained minor injuries but wasn’t taken to a hospital, the highway patrol said.

White, Thor, Mervis and Martinson all had been wearing their seat belts, but Smith wasn’t, the preliminary investigation showed.

Troopers said alcohol did not play a role in the crash. Charges are pending as the investigation continues.

The chain-reaction crash in St. Johns County happened about 7:30 p.m. and was partly a consequence of the earlier Flagler County crash accident as traffic was backed up.

The southbound traffic was being detoured to the U.S. 1 Exit. While vehicles were stopped waiting to get onto the detour, a commercial truck didn't stop for some reason and struck the rear of the stopped vehicles.

That triggered a series of chain-reaction collisions which sparked a fire that engulfed several of the vehicles. The crash involved at least eight passenger vehicles and three trucks.

The Florida Department of Transportation was set to inspect the roadway and initiate any necessary emergency repairs.

At 1 p.m. on Sunday, two of three southbound lanes of I-95 at State Road 206 were open but the Florida Highway Patrol continued to encourage people to avoid the area.
