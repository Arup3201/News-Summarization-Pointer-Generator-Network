A young couple got so carried away with their night of romance at a Premier Inn on Valentine's Day that they set their bedroom alight.

After enjoying a Valentine's dinner for two, the amorous young couple scattered rose petals around their Â£50 a night bedroom  in West Thurrock, Essex.

To put the finishing touch on the romantic atmosphere they lit 15 candles around the room.

Romantic stay: A couple was enjoying Valentine's Day at a Premier Inn when one of their candles set a pillow on fire (posed by models)

But one of the candles set a pillow on fire on their king-size bed and a blaze broke out at around 2.30am.

The hotel, just off the M25, had to be evacuated in the middle of the night, leaving more than 200 guests standing outside in the cold while four fire crews put the fire out.

The young woman had to be taken to hospital to treat burns on her arm.

Where the fire happened: The couple had booked into a double room at the Premier Inn West Thurrock to celebrate Valentine's Day

The fire fighters needed two sets of breathing gear and a hose reel jet to tackle the blaze which was put out after 40 minutes.

They also had to use a special ventilation fan to clear smoke from the hotel.

A spokesman said the Premier Inn is open for business as usual.
