Liverpool have agreed to let defender Sebastian Coates join Sunderland on a season-long loan to link up with fellow Uruguayan Gus Poyet.

Sunderland have sorted out terms for the 23-year-old central defender who faced England at last summer’s World Cup and the move is to be confirmed officially on deadline day.

Coates becomes the fourth defender allowed to leave Anfield this summer following Daniel Agger, Martin Kelly and Jack Robinson, with manager Brendan Rodgers pinning his faith in Martin Skrtel, Mamadou Sakho, Dejan Lovren and Kolo Toure at the heart of the defence.

Fellow countryman: Sunderland boss Gus Poyet has agreed a deal with Liverpool to sign his compatriot

The blonde defender was signed by Kenny Dalglish in 2011 who said ‘we are looking for him to have a long career here’. But he has made just six Premier League starts in three seasons.

With Sunderland willing to pay a loan fee and grant him regular first-team experience, Liverpool have been happy to sanction his departure.

He is the second Uruguayan to leave Anfield this window following Luis Suarez's high-profile move to Barcelona. Ironically, Coates replaced Suarez soon after the striker had scored what turned out to be the winning goal against England in Uruguay’s 2-1 World Cup victory in Sao Paulo.

Poyet, who had also been linked with Manchester City defender Micah Richards, was anxious to shore up Sunderland's defence after failing to win any of their first three league games this season.

But it means Reds striker Fabio Borini can not return to Sunderland for a second loan spell. Premier League rules prohibit clubs taking more than one player on loan from another team.
