Communities Secretary Eric Pickles hoped the offer of a 'compromise' on his planning reforms would avert a rebellion among Tory and Lib Dem MPS

Eric Pickles has been forced into a humiliating climbdown over his plans to allow homeowners to build huge extensions without planning permission.

Following a revolt by Tory and Lib Dem backbenchers, the Communities Secretary yesterday promised to water down his unpopular proposals in a bid to avoid outright defeat when the legislation faced a Commons vote.

Despite his efforts, 16 Tories and eight Lib Dems still voted against the Growth and Infrastructure Bill yesterday.

Many more abstained, cutting the Coalition’s majority to just 27.

The embarrassing U-turn throws into disarray the Government’s ‘planning free-for-all’ which is aimed at boosting the building trade.

It enables homeowners to build 26ft extensions in their garden without planning permission, doubling the current limit.

Opponents have slammed Mr Pickles’ proposals as neighbours and local councils would be powerless to object to unsightly developments.

No details have yet been released about the compromise promised by Mr Pickles, but rebels – led by Tory MP Zac Goldsmith – have warned they will have no hesitation in voting against the revised plans if they are not good enough.

On Monday night, planning minister Nick Boles launched a last-minute bid to persuade rebels to drop their opposition to the proposals by inviting them to face-to-face meetings.

But his attempts ended in failure, forcing Mr Pickles to announce his climbdown yesterday.

During a fractious debate in the Commons, Tory MP after Tory MP stood up to condemn the reforms.

Andrew Bingham said: ‘We’ve heard about monstrous carbuncles. I think we could end up with a lot of small warts on properties.’

Under the government's reforms, the size of single-storey extensions which can be built without planning permission would double to up to 8metres

Anne Main said it was ‘potentially going to be extremely divisive in communities’, while Stewart Jackson said: ‘We have seldom had a situation where so many Conservative councillors and councils and other bodies have united to say this is very bad legislation. It offends against the principle of localism.’

The Commons vote was on an amendment to the Bill put forward by the House of Lords that allows councils to opt out of the planning changes limits, which the Government wanted to reject.

The Local Government Association said it was disappointed the Commons had voted against the amendment.

Councillor Mike Jones, chairman of its environment and housing board, said: ‘It is hugely disappointing that MPs have failed to listen to the concerns of their constituents and councils and voted against this common-sense amendment and local opt-out.

Anti plan: Zac Goldsmith, Conservative MP, will vote against the law which will double the length of extensions that people can build in their gardens without planning permission

‘Imposing this home extensions free-for-all on the whole country will risk opening the floodgates to thousands of unsightly and unsuitable extensions which could create disputes between neighbours.’

Responding to the barrage of criticism, Mr Pickles said: ‘We will bring forward a revised approach on the contentious question of permitted development rights for home extensions when the Bill returns to the Lords.’

But Mr Goldsmith said the opt-out for councils was ‘in itself a modest amendment’.

He added: ‘It is hard to know what further compromise the Government might accept.’

Details of the compromise will be unveiled in the coming days, with a vote in the Lords next week and another in the Commons a few days later.
