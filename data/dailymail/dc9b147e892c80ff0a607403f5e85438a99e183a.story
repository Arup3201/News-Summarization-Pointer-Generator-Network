Juventus will meet Borussia Dortmund's famous 'yellow wall' in three weeks with a narrow advantage after a tap in apiece from Carlos Tevez and Alvaro Morata saw the Serie A leaders escape this Champions League last 16 tie with a slender lead.

Jurgen Klopp's rejuvenated team arrived off the back of three consecutive Bundesliga wins, and a composed first-half finish by Marco Reus means they travel home with an away goal in a 2-1 defeat.

The Italian champions searched for a third late on but it was in vain as Juventus must travel to Dortmund for the second leg on March 18 at the Westfalenstadion with the tie in the balance.

MOTM: Carlos Tevez 

It took just 13 minutes for Juventus to show why they sit nine points ahead of Roma in Serie A.

Morata's low drive from the left across Roman Weidenfeller saw the Dortmund goalkeeper spill it into the path of Tevez, and the former Manchester United and City striker's tap in from less than six yards gave them an early 1-0 lead.

Tevez celebrated his fourth goal in the Champions League this year with a dummy in his mouth, and Klopp may well have got a sinking feeling.

Yet this was not the same Dortmund  that were bottom of Bundesliga on February 6. 

The German club had managed wins over Stuttgart, Mainz and SC Freiburg ahead of this tie to lift them to 12th, and they were soon gift-wrapped an equaliser.

Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini's slip on the edge of the 18-yard box  saw Reus steal the ball with just goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon to beat.

The man that rejected Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United by signing a new four-year deal with Dortmund this month gave the Italian the eyes, slotting the ball to the left as the 37-year-old dived to the right. All square after 18 minutes, and an away goal in their back pocket. 

That chance for Dortmund proved to be a fluke. The Germans kept possession well, tried to press, but Juventus restored order shortly before half-time after Andrea Pirlo was forced off through injury.

Tevez held the ball up before feeding Pogba on the left, and the ex-Manchester United midfielder's cross found Morata in space six yards from goal. Like Tevez, the 22-year-old former Real Madrid youth made no mistake. 

Two shots on target, two counter-attacks, two goals from Juventus during a first half that was largely controlled by the visitors from Germany.

It was same again after the break as Klopp's team looked cool in possession but lacked the threatening touch they will need come March 18. Juventus, knowing a 2-1 advantage may not prove enough, could have made it three when Tevez met Stephan Lichtsteiner's cross, but the Argentina international could not make another fool of Weidenfeller.

It was Tevez again on 71 minutes that, among a melee of players, tried to find the bottom-left corner from 20 yards, but his shot dragged wide to Klopp's relief. Dortmund, likely to fancy their chances at the Westfalenstadion, were living dangerously.

A rare chance for the visitors arrived late on, though Ciro Immobile's strike swerved away from goal and was never troubling Buffon or the 41,182 inside the Juventus Stadium. 

The Italians, so dominant in Serie A, are not used to seeing play dictated by the away side, and frustration grew as the attacks became more frequent.

Roberto Pereyra, Pirlo's replacement in the 37th minute, could have made it 3-1 when he had a one-on-one chance on an angle to the left. He should, at the very least, have hit the target with Weidenfeller approaching, but his shot went wide of the far post and Dortmund survived.

And so the tie ended with both sides content with it all to play for in the second leg in three weeks.
