A 23-year-old old man from Minnesota who had coached young girls at a local high school  is accused of sexual assault and kidnapping after bringing two 13-year-old  girls he met online to the basement of his parents' home. 

Authorities say Casey Lee Chinn from Burnsville met the girls through Omegle, a free online chat site, and picked them around 7:30pm on Monday.

Chinn, 23, is charged with 6 counts of criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping and solicitation

Police found the girls Tuesday morning, crying and 'huddled behind a couch' in the basement of Chinn's home in Burnsville, Minn. Perhaps the most unbelievable aspect of the criminal complaint against Chinn is that he allegedly had the girls in basement because he lived with his parents who were upstair

Omegle is a free online chat site that randomly links users with strangers. It's promotional tagline is 'Talk to strangers!' 

According to the charging documents, the girls had been communicating with Chinn via text and other social media apps for about a month and the chats were 'sexually explicit.' 

Chinn knew the girls' age and acknowledged picking them up, the documents say.

When police arrived at the home, he initially denied the girls were there but after a search of the residence the two were found 'huddled behind a couch in the basement, crying and upset.'

Chinn explained to the police that he had believed the girls were unhappy and agreed to pick them up and drive them around before taking them to his home in Burnsville. 

He told them to enter the back door and to stay in the 'basement because he lived with his parents,' the documents said - he then sexually assaulted them both.    

Chinn serves as a volleyball coach at Christo Rey Jesuit High School in Minneapolis. This past winter, Chinn was named as a volunteer baseball coach in the South Washington County School District

Chinn was charged Thursday with six felonies - two counts of third degree criminal sexual conduct, two counts of kidnapping and two counts of solicitation.

Chinn has worked at several metro-area schools and organizations as a coach, according to authorities and has no criminal records. 

He has no criminal record in Minnesota. He was cited for speeding in a 2009 when he was 18-years-old.

Officials at Cristo Rey Jesuit High School in Minneapolis have since placed Chinn on leave from the part-time job as volleyball coach which he began in September.

'We are cooperating fully with the Anoka County Sheriff's Office and are encouraging our school families to discuss any interactions that their children may have had with Mr. Chinn and to come forward with any concerns,' the school said.

Chinn also has been involved in girls' softball in Burnsville and worked as a volunteer junior varsity baseball coach at East Ridge High in Woodbury for the 2014 season.
