A major sea search has been called off after a passenger was reported to have 'jumped' from a ferry in the English Channel.

The passenger was reported missing by the crew just after 1.30am when the Pride of Kent ferry was around six miles off the coast of Dover. 

HM Coastguard sent a helicopter, three lifeboats and a tugboat  to search the sea in darkness after the ferry crew said they feared someone had gone overboard.

A witness claimed he saw someone having a drink on the deck before calmly putting down their glass, climbing over the railings and jumping into the Channel.

But a Coastguard spokesman said that after the ferry arrived at Calais, a head count established that all crew and passengers were accounted for.

However, the search continued after the witness insisted they saw someone go overboard before finally being called off at 9,30am.

The spokesman added: 'The area has been extensively searched overnight and into this morning with nothing found. 

'Unless any new information comes to light, the search has been stood down.' 

The ferry left Dover at 1.11am with 385 passengers on board, with the weather conditions described as 'pretty good' when the missing-person report was made around 20 minutes later.

There had been conflicting reports about whether the passenger was a man or woman.

Chris Laming, spokesman for P&O Ferries, told MailOnline: 'We had a witness report that a male had been seen to jump over the side of the ship.

'The witness described the man as being perfectly calm. He finished his drink and walked calmly to the rail and jumped over.'

Mr Laming said the ferry went into a 'search and rescue' holding pattern as is standard procedure in the event of a person going overboard.

He added: 'These things happen from time to time very sadly'.  

The coastguard said it had received reports the passenger was a woman.  

A coastguard helicopter, several lifeboats and a tug boat from the Port of Dover were involved in the search
