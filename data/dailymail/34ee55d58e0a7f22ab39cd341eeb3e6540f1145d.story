Getting and staying fit is one of the most declared - and broken - pledges of the New Year.

But for those determined to stick to the resolution of a healthier lifestyle, MailOnline has teamed up with international rugby star James Haskell to make sure your plan lasts longer than your first trial month at the gym.

Although the recipe hasn’t changed – eating smart and working out are still the only way to bake a healthy body - there are many, many of ways to get the result you are looking for, no matter where you are in life.

Get fit like a pro: For rugby player James Haskell, staying fit is a full-time occupation - so he knows his stuff

STARTING YOU OFF:

Warm-up is key. If you are a member of a gym, foam rollers are readily available, and can be purchased in a sports shop or online.

However, a rugby/American football ball for the main muscles and a golf ball to target trigger points are great alternatives.

It is not painless, especially if you often run straight into a workout without warming up, but as it helps increase blood flow and warm up the muscle tissue it is a worthwhile practice to incorporate into your workout routine.

Ten rolls back and forward on your main muscle groups (back, calves, glutes, quads and hamstrings) and your body will thank you.

They see me rollin: Using foam rollers is an excellent way to get your muscles warm before a workout

All fired up: A good ten rolls back and forward on each muscle group will ensure that you are ready to start your workout and avoid straining your muscles

'These warm up techniques can be used at any age, a lot of people go in to the gym, especially when you are young, don't warm up properly and go straight into lifting,' James says.

'You don't need to be there for hours, you don't need to be a yoga master, what you need to do is to get your body into a good position to lift, so that no matter what you do, whether it is a bench press or a squat, your body is in line and your muscles aren't sleeping.'

Below, James has put together 
exercises which can be adapted to your goal, whether it is to get fit or
 get fitter, no matter where you are in life.

He says that 2014
 is the year to be inspired by our childhood, no matter our age. 'If 
working out becomes a chore, it will never last longer than the end of 
the month, so make it playful and fun.

'These exercises are supposed to be about accessibility, they work for everyone, especially for women.

'Many women fear that lifting weights is going to make them bulky, but that is never going to be the case.

'If you have limited space and time, a kettlebell and some rubberbands will get you a long way.'

Kettleball overhead lift: Hold two kettlebells as James is showing in the picture and lift both arms high

Medicine ball abdominal 1: Sit on the floor with your feet lifted, hold the medicine ball or equivalent with both hands and lift it from side to side, touching the floor on each side

Kettlebell swing: Create a stable base with your legs at shoulder width, 'ass to the grass', clench your abdominal muscles and swing the kettlebell from between your legs and out as you stand up

20S AND EARLY 30S

For
 many, our 20s and early 30s are about forging a career, building a 
social network and navigating romantic pitfalls.

But this is also the time when we build a base upon 
which our fitness can rest when our lives are less self-centred.

When
 getting your cardio in, channel your inner 80s kid and get back on your
 wheels.

Roller skating or long-boarding is a different way of pounding 
the pavement when you feel like mixing up your jogging.

James
 says: 'Rollerblading again will work your leg muscles and depending on 
for how long and how fast you go, you will build some body conditioning 
too.‘

LATE 30S AND 40S

Stereotypically,
 our late 30s and 40s is a time involving focus on family, partners and 
children, turning life into less ‘heels and cocktails’ and more ‘walking
 boots and milk bottles’.

Hours
 in the gym are exchanged for weekends spent in the park, which James 
says is a perfect opportunity to fit in some training time.

Get your old
 skipping rope from the attic and even a few minutes will raise your 
pulse.

If you have a partner, get together and incorporate interval 
training and body weight exercises such as using a park bench for 
step-ups and dips and burpees and lizard crawls to keep your heart rate 
up.

Medicineball abdominal 2: Lie down on your back and hold the medicine ball over your head

Medicineball abdominal 2: Sit up, bringing the ball over your head, and slam it into the ground as you come down with your arms

With your legs at shoulder width, hold 
the medicine ball at chest level. Squat holding the ball and as you come
 back to an upright position, throw the ball as high as you against the 
wall, and catch it on the way back

James says: ‘Skipping 
works your legs, your calves, your quads as well as your cardiovascular 
system. It’s a great exercise widely used by many sports people, 
requiring an entire body hit of conditioning.’

In your 30s and 40s, focus should move from pure fitness to more mobility exercises in order to stay fit and healthy as you age.

50S, 60S, AND ONWARDS

Increasingly
 independent children means time to enjoy adult life again, but if you 
want to maintain your health, it is important to continue to exercise, 
even if it is at a slower pace.

James
 says: ‘An hour’s walk over different gradients will raise the heart 
rate and help to burn off some of calories. Just make sure you have the 
appropriate supportive footwear and clothing on when you do so.’

James recommends adding a training supplement to get the best results from your fitness routine 2014.

'Getting the result you want is about training hard, training well, eating smart and ensuring you get a proper recovery process,' he says.

No surprises then that James put his own expertise to the test to create Hades and Hella pre-trainer and fatburner supplements.

Hades (for men) and Hella (for women) was created by James when he struggled to find supplements that he as a professional athlete could safely take.

Hades, Hella and James' own Organic Virgin Coconut Oil Tagaloa are available on jhbodyfire.com

Even
 10-15 minutes of daily body weight routines such as squats and abdominal
 exercises will see your health improve within weeks.

'Using a rubber band to stretch is particularly good when you have been working a long time and you may have problems with your back or legs, and they are easy to pick up online,' James says.

'Overhead dislocation sounds horrific, but it's not. Holding a rubber band at chest level and stretching it out over your head, behind your back opens up your chest.'

'Even if you cannot fit in going to the gym, a lot of exercises with bands and medicine balls is easy to do anywhere, even in your front room.'

'There is a difference between training, which is what you do in the early part in your life, when you are looking to get in shape, lose weight and perform, and exercising which is in the later part of your life when focus is on maintaining a healthy living.'
