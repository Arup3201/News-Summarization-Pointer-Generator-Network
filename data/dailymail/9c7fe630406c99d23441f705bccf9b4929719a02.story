Thousands of older homeowners are being refused better mortgage deals because of a ‘computer says no’ attitude from lenders.

Even those in their 50s are struggling to obtain home loans as an unintended consequence of tougher lending rules, a financial watchdog claims.

This has resulted in ‘mortgage prisoners’ who are stuck on their lenders’ default interest rate after failing to secure a cheaper fixed rate deal. 

Shut out: Older homeowners are being refused better mortgage deals because of a ‘computer says no’ attitude

The Financial Conduct Authority is accusing lenders of misinterpreting its new rules and defying ‘common sense’.

It said pensions were often a ‘very stable’ income and the industry must not use age as an ‘automatic bar’ to a mortgage.

The watchdog said it would be ‘looking much more closely’ at claims that lenders have applied the new rules – known as the Mortgage Market Review and introduced in April – too harshly. Banks and building societies say they are simply trying to stick to the stricter regulations.

These require more stringent checks on applicants’ current and future income and spending to ensure they can afford repayments if interest rates rise.

But critics say banks have gone too far and accuse them of refusing loans to people approaching retirement for their own financial gain by leaving them on rates that are often less favourable.

An official with the mortgage watchdog knew of cases where customers were turned down even when the switch would mean lower repayments

Most banks set an upper age limit beyond which they will not lend, typically between 65 and 80. Yet people in their 50s are also reportedly being refused because they would still be paying a mortgage in retirement.

At a conference hosted by the Council of Mortgage Lenders yesterday, Linda Woodall of the FCA said age should not be an automatic bar. 

‘There have been reports that older borrowers are finding it more difficult to get a mortgage and that this is partly down to our rules,’ she said.

‘But our rules do not aim to discourage lending to older consumers. Affordability is key. In fact the income of older borrowers such as pension income can be very stable.’

She said the FCA wanted to avoid a ‘computer says no’ attitude to lending, adding: ‘A sensible and proportionate approach is all we are asking of you’.

Mrs Woodall said even homeowners wanting to downsize or reduce their debt had been refused. She knew of cases where customers had been turned down ‘on the grounds that the new loan is not affordable’ even when the switch would mean lower monthly repayments.

She ordered banks to ‘look more closely at their interpretation of the rules’.

Mortgage broker Andrew Montlake, of Coreco Group, told of how banks were refusing new deals for homeowners in their 50s when they have reached the end of their mortgage term. ‘The banks are nervous,’ he said. ‘Whenever there is a regulatory change, there is always a tendency to rush to the harsh end of the scale.’

But broker Ray Boulger, of John Charcol, said recent pension reforms that allow customers to draw out all or part of their pension pot had made it much more difficult for lenders to estimate borrowers’ retirement income.

A spokesman for the Council of Mortgage Lenders said: ‘Lending to older borrowers whose mortgages plan to extend into retirement may sometimes be perfectly appropriate.

‘However, it has become more difficult for lenders to be sure that, at some future point, regulators will be satisfied that their lending was unequivocally appropriate at the time.’
