Ban: Russian president Vladimir Putin has said he will sign a law preventing U.S. citizens adopting Russian children

Russian President Vladimir Putin says he will sign a controversial bill banning Americans from adopting Russian children.

Mr Putin told a televised meeting in 
Moscow today that he 'doesn't see any reasons' against the bill and said
that he 'intends to sign it' into law.

The president said U.S. authorities 
deny access to adopted Russian children and lets Americans suspected of 
violence towards Russian adoptees go unpunished.

Critics say that the bill will deprive many Russian orphans of an opportunity to get a family.

The Russian parliament has voted for 
the bill, which is part of a larger measure by MPs retaliating against a
recently signed US law calling for sanctions against Russians deemed 
guilty of human rights violations.

UNICEF estimates that there are about 740,000 children not living with parents in Russia and only 18,000 Russians are now waiting to adopt a child.

The move has angered some Russians who argue it victimises children to make a political statement, reports CBS.

Russia is the single biggest source 
of adopted children in the U.S., with more than 60,000 Russian children 
being taken in by Americans over the past two decades.

Should Vladimir Putin ban Americans from adopting Russian children?

It is likely Putin's comments refer to Dima 
Yakovlev, a Russian toddler who was adopted by Americans and then died 
after his father left him in a car in extreme heat for hours in 2008. 
The father was found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter.

The 
U.S. State Department says it regrets the Russian Parliament's decision 
to pass the bill, saying it would prevent many children from growing up 
in families.

Amnesty International has called on Russian 
parliamentarians to reject the bill because it believes it have a 
'chilling effect on Russian human rights defenders'.

Amnesty International Europe and 
Central Asia director John Dalhuisen said: 'This bill is frankly a 
childish response to the Magnitsky Act.

'The Duma should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen Russian civil society, not weaken it.'

Putin said the U.S. Act had 'poisoned relations' between the two countries
