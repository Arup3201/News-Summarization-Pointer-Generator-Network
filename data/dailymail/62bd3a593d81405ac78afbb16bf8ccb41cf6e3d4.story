Cissy has never run away from home before.

But on Saturday the miniature schnauzer from Iowa did, in order to find the person that is home. 

Cissy disappeared from her yard in Cedar Rapids, only to show up about 20 blocks away at Mercy Medical Center.

Her owner, Nancy Franck, has been at the hospital for the last two weeks, after undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer.

But it remains a mystery how the dog managed to find her way back to her beloved 'mom'.

Puppy love: Cissy the miniature schnauzer ran away from her Cedar Rapids home on Saturday, traveling about 20 blocks to the hospital where her owner was undergoing treatment for cancer 

'Mom, where are you?': CCTV footage from Mercy Medical Center show the moment Cissy entered the foyer

'She's got to be in here somewhere': Security eventually spotted the dog walking up and down the halls

Searching: The family have no idea how Cissy found her way to the hospital, or knew to go there at all

'We looked up and there was this dog just that was just running across the lobby,' Mercy Security Officer Samantha Conrad told KCRG.

'We started looking at the tags and it had the address and we saw how far away this dog had lived, as far as going at least fifteen blocks to get here. 

'So it was quite an amazing journey that this dog made.'

The security guard used the dog's tags to call  Nancy's husband, Dale Franck.

Mr Franck said Cissy had been acting weird and he could tell she seemed anxious to go somewhere.

She had been missing about four hours before the hospital called. 

Happy patient: Owner Nancy Franck was grateful for the surprise visit from her pet

The journey: Cissy walked an estimated 20 blocks from her home on Washington Ave to Mercy Medical Center

Loyal: Cissy had never ran away from home before

'She wanted to go see her mom,' Mr Franck told KCRG.

'She was on a mission but she couldn't find the right elevator to take.'

The couple's daughter, Sarah Wood, then went to the hospital to get Cissy.

She of course took the eager pet up to see their mom.

'I said ''did you sneak this dog in here?'' She said ''no, she sneaked herself in here, mom''',' Mrs Fanck said. 

Scene: After being missing about four hours, Cissy turned up at Mercy Medical Center on Saturday

However the family have not been able to figure out how Cissy found the way.

They say she has never even been to the hospital before.

'That was great just being able to see her,' Mrs Fanck said.

'That was perfect. 

'I’m glad she thought of it.'
