Scotland's rich history, stunning landscapes and events such as golf's Ryder Cup are luring over two million holidaymakers a year, but what will happen to the country's lucrative tourism industry if it splits from the UK?

With rising anticipation over the Scottish referendum on Thursday, a number of industry analysts and tourism chiefs are trying to predict what a Yes vote could mean for visitors and for Scots who travel abroad.

Experts' biggest concerns relate to the potential impact on border controls, visa requirements and currency exchange rates if Scotland decides to go it alone.

Crucial vote: An independent Scotland could spell big changes for holidaymakers

Tourism is a massively important industry in Scotland, where it employs an estimated 200,000 people and attracted over 2.5 million overseas visitors last year.

Visit Scotland, the country's official tourism board, said the industry is worth £11bn and showing faster growth than the country's manufacturing, retail and transport industries.

But observers are offering conflicting views over  whether that growth will accelerate or slow down in an independent Scotland.

Border controls

Crossing the border is not expected to be a hassle if Scotland votes to separate.

Because the UK is part of an agreed Common Travel Area, Scotland is likely to remain part of it.

That means travel between the UK and Scotland would have minimal border control and people travelling to and from Scotland may not necessarily need their passport, according to insurance provider Columbus Direct. 

Money on the mind: Scotland's tourism industry will suffer if it cannot continue using Sterling, says one analyst

A recent survey by LJ research suggests most visitors do not care if Scotland is independent or not.

Of more than 700 international and local visitors to the UK in August, 84 per cent said their decision to visit Scotland would be unaffected by the referendum results.

But English respondents were twice as likely as international visitors to feel less inclined to visit.

Sean Morgan, managing director of LJ Research, said: 'It is likely that Scotland's tourism industry will suffer if it cannot continue using Sterling, as this factor will likely act as a barrier among inbound visitors' decision.' 

Scottish holidaymakers may face a reduction in availability of insurance, says Columbus Direct

Travel blogger Kath Cross, who writes for the UK Caravan Holidays website, isn't convinced that crossing the border will be a smooth experience in an independent Scotland. 

Kath wrote: 'Border controls on the border with Scotland could make a UK holiday as stressful as heading abroad.

'What exactly an independent Scotland might mean for holidaymakers is yet to be seen and of course it does all depend on a Yes vote, but it could mean the need to change money to a Scottish currency in the same way you need to when you go abroad. 

'It could mean passport control for those entering and leaving the country, and in time should the Scottish economy not be able to support its NHS that you may even need travel insurance to cover injury while you're away.'

What will happen? There are concerns about border controls, visa requirements and currency exchange rates

Joe Goldblatt, an expert in event tourism in Edinburgh, believes tourism to Scotland will boom if independence wins the vote.

He told travel news and data agency Skift: 'In the short term, tourism will dramatically increase in Scotland following independence due to the enthusiasm and interest in Scottish ancestry and culture.

'In the long term, tourism will grow even stronger due to easier and better visa regulations being put in place that will welcome more tourists to Scotland and encourage them to extend their stay to explore different parts of its beautiful land.'

The Scottish National Party claims independence will lead to lower tourism taxes, meaning cheaper holidays, more visitors and a boost for the Scottish economy.

But those in the No campaign say independence would hamper tourist flows and Scotland would lose its profile of being a member of the UK.

Travel insurance 

Scottish holidaymakers may face a reduction in availability when choosing insurance because many UK-based insurers are only able to insure UK residents, meaning Scots may either not be eligible for cover or will be directed to a specialist provider for their insurance.

There has been speculation that Scottish independence may result in a change of currency to the Euro, meaning that British insurers with license to sell insurance in Scotland may only be able to accept payments and offer settlements in Sterling.

However, Scottish independence may lead to a rise in the number of Scottish-based insurers. 

Greg Lawson of Columbus Direct said: 'If the polls are to be believed, the results on Thursday will be extremely close and a vote for independence could have a direct impact on travellers on both sides of the border.

'In the short-term, a Yes vote will disrupt the insurance markets, with both choice and price affected, but my view is that it will inevitably stabilise over time.

'The insurance industry is a mature market and adept to change and therefore will evolve to meet the needs of residents, whatever the outcome.'

Health

While Scotland is likely to keep its National Health Service, it will operate as a separate and independent Scottish NHS, meaning unless a reciprocal agreement is made between the UK and Scotland, anyone travelling between the two countries may have to pay for any medical care they receive.

If this does change, travel insurers are likely to charge higher premiums.

The premiums would be similar to those that they charge for European travel, with some providers potentially charging their customers double for cover.

National airline and air travel

And then there is the question of whether an independent Scotland should create a national airline.

Faced with the possibility of a new competitor, several aviation bosses told the Independent that Scotland shouldn't bother.

Christoph Mueller, chief executive of Aer Lingus, said: 'Don't do it.'

Professor Keith Shaw from Northumbria University, who has written an analysis on what he believes could happen if Scotland separates, said: 'There is also a good deal of anxiety about the implications, for Newcastle Airport in particular, of an independent Scottish government committing itself to an immediate 50 per cent reduction in Air Passenger Duty.

'There are also fears that cross-border businesses would suffer from any variation in exchange rates and from the potential administrative costs of dealing with two different currencies.'
