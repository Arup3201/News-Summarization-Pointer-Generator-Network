The Hollywood cast of the new Dad's Army film have been spotted out on manoeuvres as they begin shooting the movie remake of the classic comedy series.

Stars including  Michael Gambon, Daniel Mays and Toby Jones were seen in their Home Guard uniforms after they began making the new film in the Yorkshire countryside.

There was criticism of the film's world-famous cast when it was announced last month, with fans of the original saying big-money stars and expensive production would ruin the memory of the much-loved comedy.

But producer Damian Jones insists the remake will remain faithful to the original and pictures of the set appear to show the look of the new film is similar to TV series.

A heavily-camouflaged Tom Courtenay was pictured in his role as Corporal Jones - the character made famous by Clive Dunn and his catchphrase 'Don't panic!'

Photos taken in Yorkshire show Sir Michael Gambon - best known for playing Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films - getting used to his new role as frail medic Godfrey.

Bill Nighy - famous for starring in Love Actually - is meanwhile  playing Sergeant Wilson, the aristocratic but charming second in command to Captain Mainwaring.

Mainwaring himself, the character brought to life by Arthur Lowe in the original, is now being played by Toby Jones, who recently starred in blockbuster The Hunger Games.

The pictures show the Home Guard soldiers dressed in various forms of camouflage for an apparent exercise in the countryside.

Walker, now played by Daniel Mays, wears a strange leafy head-dress, while Private Pike, originally played by Ian Lavender but now by Inbetweeners star Blake Harrison, appears to be dressed in a sack.

Doctor Zhivago actor Tom Courtenay was in full webbing as he stars as old soldier and butcher Corporal Jones - who was formerly played by Clive Dunn and made famous the catchphrase 'Don't panic!'

Catherine Zeta-Jones, who plays a journalist sent to write about the Home Guard unit in the new film, was also spotted on set

Another actor, possibly Bill Paterson as Fraser,  was seen running around covered in a pantomime tree outfit.

Catherine Zeta-Jones - who is set to play a new character, a journalist who sends pulses racing when she is sent to Walmington-on-Sea to write about the unit - was also spotted on set.

Despite being given only 13 weeks when it was first aired in 1968, Dad's Army ran for 11 years and became one of the nation's favourite comedies, attracting 18million viewers at its height.

Scripts originally written by David Croft and Jimmy Perry made famous catchphrases such as 'you stupid boy', 'put that light out' and 'they don't like it up 'em'. 

The new cast were spotted filming in the countryside with each dressed up in an apparently home-made form of camouflage

Only two of the original cast are still alive, Ian Lavender, who was the mollycoddled Private Pike, and Frank Williams, who played the effete vicar.

The new film has been picked up by Universal Pictures, which means that it will be distributed worldwide.

A statement detailing the plot's outline stated: ‘Their new mission to patrol the Dover army base is a great chance to revive spirits and reputation, that is until glamorous journalist Rose Winters arrives to write about their exploits, putting the local women on red alert.

‘MI5 then discover a radio signal which was sent direct to Berlin from Walmington-on-Sea.

‘There’s a spy on the loose, the outcome of the war is suddenly at stake, and it falls to our unlikely heroes to stand up and be counted.’
