Iranian asylum seeker, Reza Berati, died during a riot at the Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea

A  Salvation Army employee led the attack that killed Iranian asylum seeker Reza Barati during the riot on PNG's Manus Island, an independent review has been told.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison on Monday released the long-awaited review - conducted by former public servant Robert Cornall - into the February violence.

The review says Mr Barati, 23, suffered a severe brain injury when he was kicked by multiple please and a rock was dropped on his head, in an attack led by a Papua New Guinean man employed by the The Salvation Army.

Mr Cornall interviewed an eye-witness to the attack.

'He said the attack was led by an identified PNG national employed by The Salvation Army and he named several other witnesses who he says can corroborate his statement.'

The Salvation Army issued a statement on Monday which acknowledged the findings of the Cornall investigation, in which they cooperated, and offered condolences to the family of Mr Berati.

The statement said: 'At the time of the alleged incident all Salvation Army personnel (both Australian and PNG) had been formally evacuated from the Centre in accordance with security protocols.

'The Salvation Army condemns any such behaviour and to the extent that any criminal actions as alleged are ultimately found by the PNG authorities to have occurred, they were not done with the knowledge or authority of The Salvation Army.'

The Salvation Army's contract to provide services at the Manus Island and Nauru centres ended at the end of February.

The Government review into the Manus Island riots said frustration and anxiety over a lack of information about resettlement policies was a key contributor to the tensions

The organistion was responsible for providing educational and recreational opportunities - including English classes, access to computer rooms and gym activities - and emotional and psychological support to asylum seekers.

The witness, who watched the attack through the open door of his room, said Mr Barati was in the internet room in the Mike compound when he heard gunshots fired and started coming up the staircase towards the witness's room.

The witness, described as a friend of Mr Barati who had come from Indonesia on the same boat as him, saw Mr Berati being followed by the Salvation Army employee who was known to him.

'When [Mr Barati] was trying to come upstairs, he hit him twice with a very long stick, and at the door of the room, when he was trying to come upstairs he further fell down,' the witness said.

'When he fall, all of the guards who were passing, they kick him in his head, and the last one, one of the PNG locals [redacted], the man [redacted], he put a very big stone at his head.'

The medical officer who treated Mr Barati at a triage centre on Manus Island said when he was brought in he was alive but medical staff knew he would not survive.

'Mr Barati's head was shattered by a crack on the left side of his skull… He also has facial abrasions and knocks indicating he has received a more general beating,' the medical officer’s record of interview said.

The treating doctor’s record of interview stated Mr Barati was bleeding externally from the back of the skull, and his fixed, dilated pupils suggested a 'catastrophic cranial injury'.

Mr Morrison said the government had accepted all 13 of the review's recommendations, including better lighting, fencing and CCTV surveillance.

The review found there was no particular factor that caused the violence.

'It is not possible to isolate one factor which, if handled differently, may have resulted in less injuries and damage or to apportion blame for causing the incidents directly to one or more of the parties involved,' it says.

But it says frustration and anxiety over a lack of information about resettlement policies was a key contributor to the tensions.

At least 69 people were treated for injuries as a result of the violence, including one man who lost his right eye, another asylum seeker who was shot in the buttocks, and another man who was slashed across the throat

At least 69 people were treated for injuries as a result of the violence, including one man who lost his right eye, another asylum seeker who was shot in the buttocks, and another man who was slashed across the throat.

Mr Morrison described the events as 'terrible and tragic'.

He said the review's recommendations had either already been implemented, or were in the process of being implemented.

This comes amid a report that almost half of asylum seekers in mandatory detention are suffering from mental health disorders, according to assessments by a government-contracted health provider.

The results show that the percentage of the asylum seeker population suffering from 'extremely severe' depression, anxiety and stress gets larger the longer they are held in detention.

The percentage of asylum seekers reported to be suffering from 'extremely severe' mental disorders after being in detention for longer than 18 months is almost triple the percentage reported for asylum seekers who have been in detention less than three months.

The findings were presented at the annual congress of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists earlier this month by Dr Peter Young, director of mental health at International Health and Medical Services, the firm contracted by the government to provide medical services in detention centres.

A report by IHMS also showed a jump in the number of asylum seekers detained on Christmas Island reported to be suffering due to trauma and torture, ‘indicating a high level of need for torture and trauma counselling services on the island’, The Age reported.
