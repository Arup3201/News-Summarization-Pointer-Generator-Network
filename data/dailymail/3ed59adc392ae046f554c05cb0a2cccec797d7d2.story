He was forced to issue a grovelling apology after claiming Wimbledon Ladies Champion Marion Bartoli was ‘never going to be a looker’.

But John Inverdale and the tennis ace will now have to put their differences aside as they will be presenting ITV’s coverage of the French Open together.

Miss Bartoli, who retired following her dramatic triumph last year, will join the 56-year-old presenter for the two-week tournament at Roland Garros, Paris, next Sunday.

Mr Inverdale will have to be on his best behaviour after his disparaging remarks last year provoked a furious backlash from listeners.

The BBC was deluged by 674 complaints after the presenter, who anchored the channel’s coverage of the Wimbledon championships, made the comments during an interview with Radio 5 Live ahead of the women’s final.

He said: ‘I just wonder if her dad, because he has obviously been the most influential person in her life, did say to her when she was 12, 13, 14 maybe, “listen, you are never going to be, you know, a looker.

“You are never going to be somebody like a (Maria) Sharapova, you’re never going to be 5ft 11in, you’re never going to be somebody with long legs, so you have to compensate for that.”’

Mr Inverdale was branded a ‘sexist moron’ by listeners, but Miss Bartoli seemed unfazed by his remarks.

The 29-year-old said: ‘I invite this journalist to come and see me this evening in ball gown and heels, and in my opinion he could change his mind. I am not blonde, yes. Have I dreamt about having a model contract? No. But have I dreamed about winning Wimbledon? Absolutely.’

Mr Inverdale said last night [Wednesday]: ‘Both the men’s and women’s games are intriguing at the moment, with the old guard being challenged by so much exciting new talent.

‘I know that the team, with Marion as a fantastic addition providing real insight into both the tennis and Roland Garros as a venue, are all looking forward to it enormously.’

The pair will be joined by four-time Grand Slam winner Jim Courier, Andy Murray’s former coach Mark Petchey, Fabrice Santoro, who played in a record 70 Grand Slams, and former British ladies number one Sam Smith.

The tournament will be broadcast on ITV3 and ITV4.
