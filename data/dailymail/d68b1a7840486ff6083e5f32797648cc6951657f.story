The Royal Family and the Middletons put up a united fashion front at the christening of Prince George at St James's Palace in London yesterday.

All wore shades of chic cream or royal blue for the event with the Duchess of Cambridge, the Duchess of Cornwall, Pippa Middleton - and of course Prince George! - all sporting off-white.

Zara and the Queen picked shades of navy and powder-blue and Carole Middleton wore a mixture of the two, in a navy coat and cream dress.

Traditional gown: Kate co-ordinated her colour with that of her son, who was dressed in a replica of the gown that Queen Victoria's first born was christened in

Mother and child: Kate and George wore exquisitely ruffled ivory gowns for the Prince's first royal engagement

Do you think they send an email round before big events? We imagine Kate being the organiser.

Yesterday, as at her last official engagement, Kate looked fresh and elegant. The proud mother stole the show in a ruffled Alexander McQueen suit, with a straw pillbox hat from Jane Taylor, a bespoke version of the designer's
Matilda hat (which costs Â£755).

George wore a delicate lace gown - even more beautifully ruffled than his mother's McQueen number - that is an exact replica of one worn 172 
years ago by Queen Victoria's first born.

He was welcomed into the faith by the Arch Bishop of Canterbury yesterday in the ivory gown made of delicate Honiton lace and white satin,
 worn before him by every baby born to the British Royal family since 
1841.

George's aunt Pippa opted for a 'trapeze' coat and 'Paris' dress by British designer, Suzannah.

The
 designer created a bespoke version of the cream wool coat with a blush 
pink trim and oyster silk lining for Pippa. A similar version is on 
sale for Â£750.

Pippa teamed her outfit with a jaunty hat by British milliner Edwina Ibbotson and carried a pale blush clutch bag.

Suzannah is a favourite designer of Pippa as she has worn her dresses on numerous occasions including society weddings.

Elegant in ivory: Camilla wears a textured coat and cream dress, accessorised with beautiful pearls

The designer told Grazia it was a 'dream come true' when Pippa approached her about her outfit for the christening.

She said: 'We aimed for understated 
beauty, drawing inspiration from a 1960s coat dress that I bought in LA,
 among other vintage looks and archive pieces.

'Creating
 a couture dress and frock coat not only for the occasion of the royal 
christening, but for Pippa Middleton, who is so naturally elegant and 
stylish is a commission that every designer dreams of.'

True blue: Both the Queen and Carole Middleton chose shades of blue for the christening

In the navy: Zara Tindall wore a chic navy dress with matching coat - and those trusty nude heels, which have become such a favourite of the royal women

The last of the ivory trio, Camilla, meanwhile, chose a smart coat, matching bag and dramatic feathered hat.

The blue brigade was led by the Queen, who looked as elegant as ever in a sky blue cashmere coat with mother of pearl buttons by Stewart Parvin over a paisley printed silk dress.

Zara
 sailed in dressed in a stylish yet understated navy blue coat and 
matching . At around six months pregnant, she looked radiant.

The
 Duchess of Cambridge's mother Carole, meanwhile, was as appropriate as ever in 
cream dress and navy coat with slimming lace panels which narrow the 
trunk of the body. Has the 'illusion' coat arrived?

Matchy matchy: The Countess of Wessex ,The Duchess of Cambridge and  The Duchess of Cornwall watching their husbands as they pass by during the procession of The Most Noble Order of the Garter, at Windsor Castle, in June 2012

The
 perfectly-groomed Carole, who smiled broadly as she arrived for 
intimate ceremony accompanied by husband Michael and children Pippa and 
James, teamed her coat with a large cream picture hat.

And it's not the first time the merry 
wives of Windsor have gone matchy matchy - who could forget Camilla, 
Kate and Sophie Wessex in co-ordinating cream and blush shades at the historic Order of the Garter service at Windsor Castle in June last year?

Then, Kate dazzled in another Alexander
McQueen outfit, with a Jane Corbett hat

Camilla, 65, sported an Anna 
Valentine cream chiffon dress and pale pink coat with a dramatic Philip 
Treacy hat, while the Countess of Wessex, 47, looked elegant in bespoke Bruce Oldfield suit and saucer-shaped hat.

Can we now expect a colour theme for each royal event? We hope so. Although cream and blue were the perfect choice for the event, and all of them looked lovely, we think everyone should follow the Queen's lead and throw a bit of bright colour in the mix next time.
