It is the stark tale of a lone fisherman ostracised by his local villagers that is still considered to have changed the face of British opera and propelled its writer Benjamin Britten to fame.

And in a special tribute to mark the composer's centenary, his famous opera Peter Grimes has finally been staged in the Suffolk fishing village of Aldeburgh which inspired the story 68 years ago.

The large-scale production has never been performed in Aldeburgh before as there are no halls big enough to show it. But producers have managed to overcome that minor detail - by staging it right on the beach where most of the opera's action takes place.

A thrilled sell-out crowd of 1,800 braved the chilly east coast wind to marvel at this ambitious staging of Britten's tragic story of a fisherman driven to destruction.

Quite a setting: Audience members arrive for the first performance of Peter Grimes which is being staged for the very first time on the beach which inspired the tale

Anniversary: The production falls on the centenary of its composer Benjamin Britten who wrote the opera 68 years ago

International opera director Tim Albery constructed a vast boardwalk on the shingle beach to act as a stage. He then decorated the set with a series of upturned fishing boats making it look as if a giant storm had swept these fragile craft up out of the water.

Aldeburgh Music's chief executive Jonathan Reekie said that although Aldeburgh had inspired Britten's operatic masterpiece they had been unable to stage it until now because the sheer scale of the opera had meant that there was nowhere big enough in the small village to perform it.

Mr Reekie said that an outdoor production with the Moot Hall only yards away put the focus squarely on the Suffolk town.

Speaking after the dress rehearsal attended by Aldeburgh residents, he said: 'It was the most wonderful evening. It received a standing ovation.

'The town has been full of the sound of the opera for the last three weeks as rehearsals have been under way and the local people have been fantastically patient with us.

Bleak: Benjamin Britten's opera Peter Grimes follows the story of a lonely fisherman on trial for the murder of his apprentice

Persecuted: But despite being cleared by the courts of the crime, Peter Grimes finds his villagers are more reluctant to accept his innocence

Last hope: Only one person believes in Grimes - the woman he wishes to marry called Ellen - who helps him track down his new apprentice

Isolated: But when Peter Grimes' second apprentice dies he finds he is completely alone - and not even Ellen is sure he is innocent

'There has been a real sense of excitement in the town and I hope it has made Aldeburgh feel really good about the Britten legacy.'

Mr Reekie said that if the international cast found daunting it to perform on the beach, the experience was useful as it brought them closer to the heart of Peter Grimes.

The opera is based on a section of George Crabbe's poem The Borough and deals with the trial of fisherman Peter Grimes over the death of his apprentice during a storm at sea.

Though he is acquitted in the eyes of the law, Grimes is still greeted with hostility by his fellow villagers who refuse to believe his innocence.

Grimes' struggle against prejudice and persecution sees him slowly descend into insanity to a tragic end.

First-rate production: Tim Albery constructed a large broadwalk to act as a stage on a shingle beach

Atmospheric: Upturned fishing boats were planted around the stage to make it appears as if a giant storm had just washed them ashore

Perfect setting: The sound of the waves washing over the shingle beach and the screams of gulls overhead added realism to the production

Wrapping up warm: Locals made sure they wore warm clothes, jackets and hats to watch the production on a chilly June evening

With the sound of surf thumping on to shingle and the screams of gulls mixing with the music, it was easy to slip into the mindset of Britten's brooding anti-hero.

The cast is the same one that performed, to great acclaim, the concert version of the opera at nearby Snape Maltings last week.

Although the performances were sung live, the Britten-Pears Orchestra was recorded at the Snape concerts and the music was broadcast on Aldeburgh Beach.

Mr Reekie said that the project was audacious enough without wanting to have an orchestra battling the wild North Sea elements as well as the cast.

Three concerts being staged are already sell-outs but the event is also being filmed to be shown in cinemas in the autumn.
