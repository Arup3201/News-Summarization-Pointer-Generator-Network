Perched on a deep pink stem as the dawn breaks, this Indonesian caterpillar cannot resist creeping up to another to give it a good morning kiss.

Dropping their heads to nestle against each other, the couple looks besotted.

Loved up: Amateur photographer Beti Monaris, 27, from Yogyakarta, Indonesia watched as the two caterpillars crawled up together and met face-to-face in his backgarden

The spell-binding image was caught by amateur photographer Beti Monaris, 27, as he went out into his back garden in Yogyakarta, the capital of Java, at 7am.

Almost walking straight into the silent and loved-up pair, he crept backwards to grab his camera without disturbing the moment.

The caterpillars look like a piece of art sharing their moment on a bright pink stem.

Dawning: As the sunlight breaks, the creatures nestle their heads against each other lovingly

It is the start of monsoon season in the former Dutch colony, making the water-soaked caterpillars and stem glisten even more.

Heavy rain, coupled with high temperatures, starts in November and lasts until April, giving rise to rich and colourful plants.

Designed to blend in with their surroundings to avoid predators, this is a rare snapshot of the creatures venturing into dangerous grounds.
