Saturday was the first time in a long time that I have seen an England team play attractive football. I really enjoyed their performance, despite the result. They played with real flair, particularly Raheem Sterling.

But if England are to make a real mark on this tournament, either Wayne Rooney or Daniel Sturridge needs to start Thursday’s match against Uruguay on the bench.

Yes, it is a tough decision for Roy Hodgson to leave one of them out but they both play the same position. There would also then be the advantage of bringing one of them off the bench to change the game.

One or the other: Daniel Sturridge or Wayne Rooney must be dropped to the bench against Uruguay

You need to keep back one of your ‘firework’ players for when the opposition are tiring — Argentina did it well with Gonzalo Higuain against Bosnia.

It’s a bigger sacrifice to put Rooney out on the left than on the bench. Unlike a lot of people, I thought Rooney played well against Italy so it is a tough choice between him and Sturridge, who is in such good form.

I would also like to see England give Steven Gerrard more support. He was having to defend, create and attack on Saturday, which is too much for one person to do.

If England support him more, he will have more energy, which is vital as when his energy dropped after an hour against Italy, England faded.

Give him more support: Steven Gerrard was having to defend, create and attack against Italy

English fans can sometimes be a bit harsh on their team so I hope there is a real positive energy created around the team.

It has been a long season and, although it sounds simple, loud support from the fans does give players extra power.

Football is an entertainment business and the players would be nowhere without the fans. At tournaments like this, they need them more than ever.

My country Holland made a cracking start and gave Spain a real wake-up call with the 5-1 thrashing on Friday night.

Bizarrely, I think the tournament will become harder for Louis van Gaal’s team as their opponents will be taking them even more seriously. The alarm bells will be ringing.

You don’t need me to tell you what a great coach Van Gaal is — his c.v does that. But what sets him apart is his ability to get his message across to his players and get them working really well as a team.

The boss: Louis van Gaal (right) high fives Robin van Persie and his ability to get the best out of his players sets him apart from other coaches

He is an very explosive man but most great coaches are and he has the tactical and technical ability to get away with it. He is also highly motivated after failing to qualify for the World Cup during his first spell as head coach.

I wouldn’t put Holland up there with Germany, Brazil and Argentina as the favourites for the tournament but they are not too behind after that performance.

World champions Spain need to respond against Chile — it will be a huge test.

Germany impressed me but they didn’t surprise me. Brazil and Argentina looked like they were feeling the pressure but two teams that really impressed me were Ivory Coast and USA.

Ivory Coast are much more organised than the other African teams and they have such quality.

Once they used that quality to turn the game around against Japan, they didn’t let their opponents have a single effort on goal and it was that that impressed me most. They were in control and are now a mature side who will do well.

Passion: John Brooks could not quite believe it after scoring the USA's winner against Ghana

USA have the great combination of Jurgen Klinsmann’s discipline and their natural national passion. They were so organised against Ghana and are a real threat to Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal. I wouldn’t be surprised to see them qualify.

Finally, I want to congratulate Brazil on the tournament so far. Despite all the concerns before it started, everything is going great.

They atmosphere is very special — Brazilians are picking a team to support for the game they’re watching and making lots of noise.

Here in Rio, there is a lot of fun, a lot of music and a lot of joy — I haven’t seen even the slightest hint of danger. I’m having a lot of fun, especially in the BBC studio.

Full of fun: Two Brazilians pose at the France-Honduras match and the World Cup atmosphere is special
