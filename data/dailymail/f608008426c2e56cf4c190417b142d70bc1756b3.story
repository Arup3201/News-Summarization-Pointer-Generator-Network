Former official Keith Hackett has spoken out on the referee's decisions that marred Saturday's 1-1 draw between Chelsea and Burnley, siding with Jose Mourinho's version of events.

Chelsea claim they were denied two penalties before Nemanja Matic was sent off for his aggressive reaction to a career threatening foul by Ashley Barnes - who should have already been sent off for a foul on Branislav Ivanovic.

Hackett slammed referee Martin Atkinson for a ‘pretty appalling performance’ while claiming the Serbian midfielder was fortunate not to have suffered a broken leg following Barnes' challenge.

Speaking to Chelsea TV, Hackett said: ‘I asked the question: is this the worst performance by a Premier League referee ever? It certainly borders on that, but when you get one incident in a match you might be able to discuss it and condone it, or find a method of understanding why the referee made an error, but I think we had a catalogue.

‘I found myself nodding in agreement with Jose Mourinho in terms of the incidents. In the 30th minute out on the wing Barnes clearly commits a red card challenge on Ivanovic.

‘Then you follow it up in the 33rd minute with the Burnley player [Michael Kightly] holding out his arm, making himself bigger. He knew what he was doing and, in my opinion, it should have been a penalty kick.’

The former general manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Board was also at a loss to explain why Barnes did not receive his marching orders for his foul on Matic.

‘Nobody can condone the challenge that Barnes puts in on the Chelsea player,’ said Hackett. ‘He’s off the ground, out of control and he’s taken the player. How he’s escaped without a broken leg is beyond me.

‘My view is that the players wouldn’t have to take their own action if they had confidence the referee was doing his job and, in this case, the referee wasn’t doing his job. In my opinion he had a pretty appalling performance.’

Mourinho appeared on Sky Sports' Goals on Sundato discuss the controversial draw with Burnley

Chelsea's official website appears to have adopted Mourinho's seige mentality following the Portuguese manager's claims that there is a 'campaign' against his team.

The site outlined the four incidents that Mourinho had highlighted in minutes 30, 33, 43 and 69: an unpunished challenge from Burnley's Ashley Barnes on Branislav Ivanovic; being denied two 'clear' penalties and a shocking Barnes' challenge on Nemanja Matic - again unpunished.

Following Match of the Day's analysis of the match, the website also posted a lead article entitled: 'Match of the Day: Referee ' had a terrible game'. 

30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up in anger when he realises no action is being taken. Verdict: Should have been a free-kick and could have been a yellow card. for Barnes. 

33 - Ivanovic fires a shot at goal but Michael Kightly diverts it with an outstretched arm, as he turns his back to goal. Martin Atkinson waves play on. Verdict: Should have been a Chelsea penalty. 

43 - Diego Costa tumbles to the ground after Burnley captain Jason Shackell leans into him with an oustretched arm. Atkinson waves play on. Verdict: Could have been a Chelsea penalty but would have been very soft.
