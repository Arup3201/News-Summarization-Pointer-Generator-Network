Didier Drogba has asked for patience in his bid to show some of his former brilliance after returning to Chelsea.

The 36-year-old missed last Saturday's Premier League defeat of Swansea with an ankle problem, but was thrust into the starting line-up for Wednesday night's Champions League clash with Schalke.

Drogba was unable to add to his 157 Blues goals - accrued over eight years, from 2004 to 2012 - and Chelsea were punished as the Germans claimed a 1-1 draw.

Chelsea striker Didier Drogba says he need time to get back to the level Blues fans are used to 

The Stamford Bridge legend is desperate to add to the 157 Chelsea goals he scored between 2004 and 2012

'For a first game I felt okay, kind of okay,' Drogba, who left Stamford Bridge after scoring the decisive penalty in the 2012 European Cup win, told Chelsea TV.

'The good thing is no pain in the ankle, so now I can start working and training and improve the condition.

'I was feeling much better in the second half. I'm like a diesel, I need time.'

After missing two easy chances against Schalke on Wednesday, Drogba was taken off for Diego Costa

Drogba twice was unable to convert what would once have been meat and drink to him, firstly when Willian crossed inside the six-yard box and then when Eden Hazard played him in.

Drogba added: 'I had (chances), especially the one in the second half. It was a clear chance and I think it's unlucky.

'If I score there there's no more game. The fact that you don't score, they still believe in the equaliser and that's what happened afterwards.'

Chelsea's £32m signing Diego Costa is also struggling with injuries and can't play three matches in a week
