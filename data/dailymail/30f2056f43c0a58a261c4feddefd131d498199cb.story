A father of four has been shot dead after he was involved in a road rage incident and the man he brawled with returned to his property with a gun, police say.

Thomas Brock, 30, died when he was fatally shot at his home in Pasadena, California, after being involved in an argument with another motorist.

Police have now arrested brothers Steven Rodriguez, 24, and Jacob Rodriguez, 29, and charged them with capital murder following the alleged road rage killing.

Police say Thomas Brock (left) had become involved in a traffic altercation in the lead up to his death. His widow Julie (right) said she and her husband had no idea who the men were

The violent standoff began about 9pm on Monday, when Mr Brock and one of the suspects got into an argument, the Houston Chronicle reported.

Mr Brock was then followed to his home where the two had a fist fight, after which the alleged killer left the property but warned he would return. It is unclear which brother was involved from the start of the incident.

Pasadena Police said he then returned with the second suspect. The two kicked down Mr Brock's front door, entered the house and shot him dead.

Mr Brock's widow Julie Brock told KHOU: 'This is just unbelievable.

'We didn't even know these guys. They came and killed a man that was a wonderful husband and wonderful father.'
