Fireman Sam fan Lewis Dudson is so keen to be like his TV hero he has been allowed to join fire crews for daily drills - at the age of just six. 

Each day at 7pm after school Lewis turns up at his local fire station in his mini fireman's uniform and yellow helmet to stand to attention with the other firefighters at their shift change.

The youngster has wanted to be a fireman when he grows up ever since he started watching the children's TV show two-years-ago.

Attention! Lewis Dudson joins Eccles Fire Station crew everyday to take part in drills

His mother Jayne Guthrie, 32, took him to watch the drills and exercises at Eccles Fire Station, in Salford, Greater Manchester, and the firefighters invited him to join in. 

Since then they have taught him how to stand to attention, how to turn on the siren and even work the fire hose.

Mum-of-one Jayne, a hospital worker, said: 'It all started with Fireman Sam and he's even got different fire brigade helmets - a yellow one which is a firefighter's, and a white one which is the boss'.

'He likes to use the 'boss' one so that I have to salute him while we're at home.

'Lewis says, 'attention,' 'salute,' 'at ease,' and 'fall out.' He scares the living daylights out of me when he shouts them sometimes.'

His dream to become a firefighter began a couple of years ago when Lewis first watched Fireman Sam on TV.

He would always ask for Fireman Sam Toys for his birthday and last year his mum bought him the whole outfit complete with a helmet.

Since watching the drills at the fire station he has been going every day - including weekends - for the shift change so he can line up with the other firefighters and salute when the station manager comes out.

Miss Guthrie said: 'He stays for the roll call when the night shift takes over from the day shift. 

'In the school holidays he was going in the morning but now he's back in school he goes for the night time roll call at 6.59pm.

'He stands in line with the firemen until the chief comes out to see them at 7pm.

'He knows so much - he knows where everything is in the engine and how much of all the equipment is needed in each engine.

'He knows where the lights are in the cab, can turn the hose on and off and knows the difference between the fire, police and ambulance sirens.

'He also knows the call signs for the engines.

'He's even gone to watch training where the firefighters rescued someone out of a burning car. That was amazing.

'After he's been at the station after school he comes home and tells me what he's done then makes me salute him.'

'He always says, "when I'm a fireman I will rescue people.' He knows the dangers because he always tells me to pull the plugs out of their sockets and turn off the switches.'

Lewis has a collection of fire trucks which he loves to play with but because he is getting a bit older he now has London Burning DVDs from old second hand shops and he loves Chicago Fire and Real Rescue.

'Every time he hears a fire engine going by he runs out of the house to see it,' his mother said.

She added: 'They all look after him at the station. They really take the time to show him what to do. They could easily have just left him at the railings but they went over to him and were really glad he showed interest.

'I can't thank the fire station enough for what they've done for Lewis. I'm also really proud of Lewis - it could just be a phase but it's great that he has something he is so passionate about now.'

White Watch Manager Stan Bradburn said it is pleasure to him on station every night. He said: 'Lewis has become a bit of a local legend with the crews at Eccles and he's a likable little chap in his own uniform.

'He's been coming down at shift change for a good couple of months now and he's so enthusiastic about everything we do.

'It's a pleasure to have him on station for a few minutes every night and I know all the watches feel the same, we let him have a look at the fire engines and join in with the cleaning of the engine at the start of shift and he loves it.'

Eccles Fire Station Manager Paul Smitham added: 'Lewis is a smashing little lad and for someone so young I have never known anyone so knowledgeable and interested in the fire service.

'Every day without fail he's there in all kinds of weather.'
