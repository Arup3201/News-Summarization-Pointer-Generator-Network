Gary the Goat was caught eating public vegetation and his owner fined. The fine was cancelled today

When a magistrate realised who the next defendant was on the court list she must have thought the police were kidding, so to speak.

For the miscreant was Gary – Gary the goat that is.

And while it was Gary’s owner who had been booked, it was the goat who was the real culprit, Magistrate Carolyn Barkell was told in Sydney’s Downing Centre Local Court today.

Owner James Dezarnaulds, a comedian who is also known as Jimbo Bazoobi, had been issued with a £292 fine last August after police caught Gary chomping away on flowers outside Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art, which is located beside the city harbour.

Mr Bazoobi decided the fine was unjust and elected to take the case to court. He took Gary along with him, too, but the goat, wearing a rainbow hat, was asked to remain outside while the case proceeded.

Miss Barkell noted that ‘he did eat garden plants.’

But she said there was no evidence Mr Bazoobi had brought Gary to the area with the intention of vandalising vegetation.

‘He may have preferred to have an ice cream,’ she said.

Mr Paul McGirr, lawyer for the goat, told the court that the police had issued the wrong infringement notice because it related to a person and not a goat.

‘The liability (for the fine) attaches to a person, but Gary’s not a person.

‘In addition,’ he told the magistrate, ‘it can’t be proved that Mr Bazoobi put Gary up to the act of eating flowers.

‘We can’t guess what Gary might have been whispered in his goat ear.’

Police prosecutor Senior Sergeant Rick Mansley said Mr Bazoobi was fined correctly because he knew Gary was hungry and had been reckless in letting him near the flowers.

‘Maybe we should just have an argument on whether Jimbo or Gary the Goat should be in the dock,’ said Mr McGirr.

Mr Bazoobi told the police who dragged his goat from the flower bed that he had brought his companion to the park because he needed to eat.

The magistrate cancelled the fine, saying it should never have been issued but dismissed Mr Bazoobi’s application for the Crown to pay his legal costs.

Outside the court Mr Bazoobi told a crowd of journalists that he was delighted Gary’s name had been cleared.

‘I just think there’s so many laws and regulations in Australia which are just an abuse of common sense.

‘This is actually an abuse of the laws of nature – a goat eating grass.

‘I’m a comedian – I can come up with jokes, but it’s pretty hard to compete with the cops coming out with this stuff.’
