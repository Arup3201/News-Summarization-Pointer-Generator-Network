Insects may be small, but they have some of the most intricate faces in the animal kingdom.

Now a wildlife photographer has captured extreme close-ups of the creepy crawlies, revealing the complex compound eyes of flies, aggressive stance of ants and even water drops clinging onto one insect’s hairy face.

The striking images were shot by 33-year-old Yudy Sauw at his home studio in Tangerang, Indonesia.

His models included a soldier fly, red ant and a longhorn beetle, which he painstakingly watched to get the best shot.

While the creatures may not sound particularly exotic, they are interesting. Soldier flies mimic organ pipe mud dauber wasps and longhorn beetles make pests of themselves by boring into wood to damage trees and houses. 

To take his photographs, Mr Sauw placed the insects between half an inch (2cm) and four inches (10cm) away from his camera.

He used specialist lighting and a macro lens on his camera to record the creatures’ portraits, before enhancing them on a computer.

Mr Sauw said: ‘I love macrography because I can see clearly what I cannot see with my normal eyes.

‘I can see the small world of insects, what they look like and what they do.'

Macrophotography
 allows photographers to see insects in unprecedented detail. This image
 shows the pattern on an insect's compound eyes as well as the different
 types of hair on its face - from short hairs on its antennae to long 
tufts

Gardeners
 may think twice about killing greenfly attacking their roses, after 
seeing this image of the creature's amazing compound eyes. Greenfly and 
aphids  are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants
 in temperate regions

Several species of longhorn beetle (pictured) are pests and the larvae often bores into wood, where they can cause damage to trees and structures. A number of species mimic ants, bees, and wasps

Red ants, also known as fire ants are more aggressive then other species. They often attack small animals and can kill them. Unlike many other ants, which bite and then spray acid on the wound, fire ants bite only to get a grip and then sting, injecting a toxic  venom called Solenopsin into their victim. For humans, this is a painful sting, which some say burns like fire

He used specialist lighting and a macro lens on his camera to take record the creatures’ portraits, before enhancing them on a computer. This curious image shows a developing insect in an eg

A compound eye may consist of thousands of individual photoreceptor units or ommatidia. Flies see a combination of images from different eye units giving them a view from different directions and a wide field of view

An extreme close-up of a soldier fly is pictured. The family contains about 1,500 species, all of which are scavengers - with some feasting on algae

The face of a longhorn beetle is pictured. The largest member of the family is the rare titan beetle (Titanus giganteus) from northeastern South America, with a maximum known body length of just over seven inches (16.7 cm)
