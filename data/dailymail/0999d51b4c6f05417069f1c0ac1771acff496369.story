Flesh-eating bacteria survivor Aimee Copeland has shown off her bionic hands on the Katie Couric show a year since she lost her four limbs to the aggressive infection.

The 25-year-old Georgia native revealed her astonishing on-going recovery on the show, eliciting cheers from the crowd as she walked on stage using new limbs and a cane for support.

It comes a year since Aimee, who suffered her life-changing injuries when she cut her leg after falling from a zipline into a lake, appeared on the show for the first time with just one prosthetic leg and relying on a walking frame to cross the stage.

Smiling: Aimee Copeland, who lost her limbs to a flesh-eating bacteria last year, appeared on Katie Couric's show

Fighter: Aimee walked across the stage using her new prosthetic limbs and just a cane for support

Speaking to Katie, she showed how her
new bionic hands - which open and close by her pushing her wrists 
backwards and forwards - and said the new limbs and her new service dog 
Belle have made every day tasks so much easier.

'It's a difficult process when you wake up in the morning and you realize this is my life,' she said, adding: 'I think I'm at the place now where I wake up and I'm like, "yeah I'm at the same place I was at yesterday".' 

Thanks to the new prosthetics, gadgets in her home and her unwavering upbeat attitude, Aimee is now able to put on makeup, brush her teeth, text, type for her social work degree and even drive.

She said that she still has bad days but that she chooses to have a positive attitude. Even when she fell over in the shower in her New York hotel, she knew that she only had one option.

Changes: She showed off the bionic hands which have helped her complete everyday tasks

Life-changing: She pushes her wrists forwards and backwards to close and open the fingers on her hands

Help: She showed that the new limbs can help her with tiny details - such as brushing makeup off her face

'You can curl and and cry all day or you can smile over it or you can just scream real loud and just carry on doing what you're doing,' she said. 'So that's what I did.'

Sitting among the audience, her father, Andy Copeland, said: 'She can make lemonade out of lemons better than anyone else I know.'

Despite her inspiring appearance, Aimee expressed her doubts about going on the show in a blog on Katie Couric's website.

'When I was invited to come back to Katie this year, I really didn’t think I had come far enough to return,' she wrote. 'I didn’t want to come back until I had my left leg because I didn’t want to be in the same place I was last year. I wanted to show progress to everyone.'

Making friends: She also introduced Katie to her new service dog, Belle, who helps her retrieve items

Moving on: Aimee can use the hands to help her type and text. She uses her iPad to switch on light and heat

Brave: Aimee, pictured at a physical therapy session, needed her limbs amputated after the flesh-eating bacteria got through a cut she sustained when falling off a zipline into a lake

The new normal: She is seen leaving her home with her new dog, who handlers say is bubbly like Aimee

But eventually, doctors deemed her skin on her left leg strong enough, she was fitted for the limb - and she realized she was ready to appear again.

'This year, I feel a lot stronger,' she said. 'Last year... I was so dependent on other people to help me with everything. Now I can do so many more things for myself. I feel independent.'

She added: 'When I come back to Katie next year, I see myself walking onto the stage again, this time without a cane. I see myself practicing social work and actually taking on my own cases.'

Aimee was injured on May 1 last year when she traveled down a homemade zipline that snapped, sending her into a lake on the Little Tallapoosa River near Carrollton.

A cut on her left leg from rocks in the water became infected with necrotizing fasciitis, caused by a flesh-eating bacteria which is found in many fresh-water rivers.

Support: Aimee is pictured with her parents, Andy and Donna Copeland, outside Doctors Hospital in Augusta, Georgia last June. They described their astonishment at her positive attitude

As her organs shut down, her parents made the agonizing decision to amputate her limbs to save her life. She had to undergo several months of hospitalization and rehabilitation.

Her bionic hands, which usually cost around $100,000 each, were given to her for free because she participated in a Georgia Tech research project about the limbs.

She completed her master’s degree in psychology from University of West Georgia in August and will now work on a second master’s degree in social work at Valdosta State University to become a licensed counselor.

While appearing on Katie Couric's show, a representative from Citi in Atlanta presented her with a check of $25,000 from the company to go towards a holistic center she wants to open.

The center will give people with disabilities the opportunities to experience nature and garden while undergoing therapy.
