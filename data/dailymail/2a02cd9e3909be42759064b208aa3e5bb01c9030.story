Angelina Corpuz was sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid community work for her 'appalling' behaviour

A nursing home employee has admitted to 'snapping' and spitting at an 85-year-old dementia sufferer she was supposed to be caring for.

Angelina Corpuz, 59, assaulted the elderly man, who suffered from dementia and had severe mobility and communication issues, while she was working nights at his nursing home.

Corpuz and another care assistant were taking him to his room when he became frustrated and began spitting at them.

She eventually 'snapped' after coming 'to the end of her tether' and spat back at the frail father.

Her concerned colleague alerted bosses at Wilton Manor Nursing Home, in Southampton, and she was sacked from her job.

Corpuz admitted spitting at the man at Southampton Crown Court.

She insisted she didn't mean for any saliva to land on the elderly man and claims she only retaliated to show him that he shouldn't spit.

But in her victim impact statement read to court, the victim's daughter, who does not want to be named, said: 'I can't help wondering if the assault contributed to his death.'

After the case, she added: 'My dad was a lovely, caring man who lived for his family.

'We kept him at home for so long with mum but there came a point where he needed proper care and we put our trust in the staff at the nursing home, and on that night that trust was betrayed.

'You are literally handing over the life of someone you love into someone else's hands and that is one of the most difficult decisions.

'I can't begin to imagine what my dad went through on that evening, he must have been terrified.

'It was a gross act of inhumanity that has disgusted and appalled me.'

Judge Derwin Hope said that Corpuz had 'recklessly assaulted' the victim, who had been in the home for eight months, but accepted that it 'arose from the strain' of her job.

He added: 'It was a terrible way to treat anyone, particularly one so vulnerable and who relied upon you to treat him with care and decency, as did his family.'

Corpuz, who now works as a cleaner, was sentenced to complete 120 hours of unpaid community work.

She was ordered to pay 200 pounds costs and a 60 pound victim surcharge.

A spokesperson for the nursing home said: 'Everyone at the home was shocked by Angelina Corpuz's behaviour last year.

'None of us can understand how an experienced and fully trained care assistant could behave this way.

'Our people used our whistle-blowing system to raise concerns about this individual's behaviour and we acted immediately by suspending this person and calling in the police.

'The actions of this individual last year do not reflect the home or the committed people who work here.

'Our residents' welfare is always our number one priority.'
