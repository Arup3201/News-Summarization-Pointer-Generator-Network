Plans are being drawn up to curb Scottish MPs’ voting rights, amid English anger at the sweeteners offered to persuade voters north of the border to reject independence.

Government sources say David Cameron and Nick Clegg are ‘very aware’ of backbench fury over the hastily pulled together ‘devo max’ proposals.

But any move to restrict MPs’ voting rights will be opposed by many senior Labour figures, who will try to push back a deal until after the next election.

Tory MPs last night warned they could throw out the entire plan to hand greater powers to Scotland unless the huge ‘subsidy’ paid by English taxpayers via the so-called Barnett formula is also ended: Salmond (left) and Cameron (right) ahead of the referendum

Tory MPs last night warned they could throw out the entire plan to hand greater powers to Scotland unless the huge ‘subsidy’ paid by English taxpayers via the so-called Barnett formula is also ended.

Deputy Prime Minister Clegg said yesterday that it was ‘simply not fair’ to hand sweeping new powers to Scotland without also limiting the right of Scottish MPs to vote on English matters at Westminster.

The Lib Dem leader was confronted on the issue by a series of angry English callers on his phone-in show on LBC.

They questioned why England should continue to subsidise Scottish policies such as free care for the elderly, free university tuition and free prescriptions, which are not available south of the border.

The Prime Minister has avoided discussing the issue in recent weeks, for fear of handing a propaganda victory to the SNP.

But senior Tories last night indicated that Mr Cameron will move swiftly to announce plans for ‘English votes for English laws’ in the event of a No vote.

Proposals drawn up for the party in opposition by former chancellor Kenneth Clarke can be ‘taken of the shelf’, and are likely to be unveiled formally in January alongside devolution plans for Scotland, they said. ‘It’s something the party has long had a position on and it is obvious that something now needs to be done,’ said one senior Conservative.

But Labour fears the move could prevent the passing of legislation on key issues such as health and education.

If cross-party pledges to devolve major tax powers are put in place, Scotland’s 59 MPs could even be prevented from voting on parts of the Budget.

Former prime minister Gordon Brown – who is leading Labour’s efforts in Scotland – ruled out reducing the rights of Scottish MPs as part of any post-referendum constitutional deal, saying: ‘I don’t think you can have two classes of MPs at Westminster.’

But Tory MPs said it would be ‘untenable’ to allow Scottish MPs to continue to enact laws in England that do not affect their own constituents.

And several indicated they would vote against any package that retained the Barnett formula – which means public spending per head is £1,623 a year higher in Scotland than in England.

MP John Whittingdale said: ‘I for one would be very concerned at the idea that my electorate would continue to subsidise the Scots even after they have been given all these powers to raise even more money.’
