When you're hot, even sporting legends clamber to have their pictures taken with you as golf's world No 1 Rory McIlroy found out ahead of the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship at St Andrews.

Former Barcelona, Real Madrid and Inter Milan star Luis Figo grabbed a photo opportunity with the northern Irishman before proudly posting the picture on his Twitter account with the caption: 'With the number 1 @McIlroyRory'.

McIlroy was named PGA Tour player of the year on Wednesday, after a blistering end to the season that saw him collect The Open, WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and US PGA Championships in consecutive tournaments.

McILroy has never won the event staged at the Old Course, St Andrews

The 25-year-old followed with what he described as icing on the cake after victory for Europe in the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles - where wild celebrations resulted in him pictured topless, wearing a mini-kilt and bright red wig on Sunday evening.

However, McIlroy is now back in the swing of things at the pro-am event staged over the Old Course in Carnoustie and Kingsbarns - a tournament he has never won before.

'It's a tournament that I have played well at but never been able to win,' said McIlroy, whose amateur partner is his father Gerry. 

'I finished third in 2007 (enough to gain his European Tour card in his second event as a professional), second in 2009 and second again in 2011.

'I've been close so it would be nice to win, especially as it's my dad's 55th birthday on Sunday. 

'If we can make the cut in the team event and be able to walk around St Andrews on his birthday and me have a chance to win the tournament as well, it would be very special.'
