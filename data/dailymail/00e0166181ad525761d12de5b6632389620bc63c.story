A mother who went into premature labour on a flight was forced to give birth in the airplane toilet.

The aircarft was forced to make 
an emergency landing in Vietnam after the Filipina woman gave birth to a boy.

Two Filipina nurses on the flight rushed over to help with the mid-air delivery as the plane flew from Dubai to Manila.

And the mother has decided to name the boy EK after the airline code for Emirates.

One of the nurses, Karen Caballes-Santos told Gulfnews partner website XPRESS: 'When I saw the mother walking toward the toilet, she seemed to be in pain. The father was restless… walking back and forth, nearly in tears, so I offered to help.'

She said she found the baby inside the toilet turning bluish-brown' due to lack of oxygen.'

After clearing the amniotic fluid from the baby’s mouth, nose and ears, oxygen masks were given to the pair.

The baby was kept wrapped in cabin blankets and kept warm using the LED lamps attached to the passengers seats.

The website reported that the 35-year-old mother was discharged from hospital on Friday, but the baby, born early at 27 weeks, is still in critical care.
