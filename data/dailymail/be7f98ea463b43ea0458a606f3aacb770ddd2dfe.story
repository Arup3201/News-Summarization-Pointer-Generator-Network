A 66-year-old woman was crushed to death by a homemade elevator as she tried to visit her disabled friend.

Margaret Harrison's body was found trapped under the device by her long-term partner Frank Jorr, who had gone to search for her after she failed to show up at Jean Blair's home on Tuesday morning.

Mrs Blair's husband, Robert, had built the elevator out of an old forklift truck 17 years ago to make it easier for his wife, who uses a motorized scooter, to get around their Weeki Wachee, Florida home.

Ordinarily he would be the one to operate the elevator, which has since been condemned, but he was having an operation on Tuesday morning, according to 10 News.

His wife, who had arranged for Mrs Harrison to keep her company while her husband and son were at the hospital, had sent the elevator to the ground floor, not realizing her friend was in its path.

Mrs Blair, now 81, is mostly stationary due to heart problems and failing limbs and relies on a power wheelchair. She called Mrs Harrison her 'very best friend.'

'My heart is just broken,' she said.

Those who knew her Mrs Harrison said she was a kind, generous woman who put others before herself.

The lift had been on the side of the three-storey home for 17 years and when police examined it 'they couldn't find anything wrong with it' said Mr Blair

Mrs Harrison's body was discovered by Mr Jorr who Mrs Blair had called after she became concerned when her friend had not arrived. 

After finding Mrs Harrison's car in the driveway he headed towards the elevator, where he could see something poking out from under it.

He activated the elevator to raise it, which is when he discovered his partner trapped underneath. 

'I knew as soon as I saw her,' Mr Jorr told the Tampa Bay Times. 'She was blue already.'

Mrs Harrison, a widow and mother of two grown children, had met him in 2002.

Mrs Blair had offered to meet her friend on the ground floor so they could ride up in it together, but Mrs Harrison had told her she knew how the elevator worked and would make her own way to the second floor.

Mr Blair has suggested that perhaps Mrs Harrison had a seizure, which is why she was unable to get out of the way.

Condemned: The elevator, built by Robert Blair for his wife 17 years ago, has been shut down by officials

He built the lift on the side of his three-storey home 17 years ago, and said when police examined it 'they couldn't find anything wrong with it'.

The elevator, made from a forklift, steel and wood, has since been condemned by the Building Department, which said it was illegal because it had been built without permits, and was also unsafe.

Under Florida law, lifts and other conveyances in private homes do not require certificates of operation or inspections.

There
was no electrical permit issued, as required, for the Blairs' device, 
said county Building Department operations manager Jodi Singer.

The elevator also lacked the required safety switches, county building official Frank Curlee said.

Officials shut down the device, but no citations were issued.

The couple told police that the elevator, which could work even in a power cut, was serviced every month, according to ABC Action News.

Mrs Harrison's death has been ruled as accidental after a post-mortem examination.
