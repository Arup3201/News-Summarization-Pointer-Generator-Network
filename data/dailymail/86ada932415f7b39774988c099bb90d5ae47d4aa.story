Rihanna's staff asked Topshop to send her clothes – after she had threatened to sue the store for using her face on a T-shirt.

The singer claims the ‘unendorsed’ white T-shirt with a photograph of her in a bra top may have damaged her image.

But that didn’t stop her entourage calling Topshop six times after a dispute had broken out ‘asking for products for her to wear’, according to the store.

Dispute: Rihanna is suing Topshop over the T-shirt bearing the picture of her face, seen left, which she claims is similar to one of her album covers and could mislead fans into believing the item was 'genuine' merchandise

But while the singer is claiming the 
top blighted her image it has not stopped her entourage contacting 
Topshop to ask for clothes for Rihanna half a dozen times since the 
lawsuit was launched.,  the retailer's lawyers said.

A barrister at London's High 
Court today claimed Rihanna's representatives had asked Topshop for products for the singer on '10 recent occasions', and said her 'shopping 
habits' were testament to the retailer's own considerable reputation.

Of those 10 occasions, six came after Rihanna launched proceedings against Topshop, said Geoffrey Hobbs QC.

Mr Hobbs said: 'It is not in dispute 
that Rihanna is a celebrity (but) the reputation of Topshop is also 
material to the allegation of misrepresentation.

'Rihanna's
 own shopping habits provide compelling evidence of Topshop's reputation
 in fashion wear. (There are) 10 recent occasions on which her 
representatives have contacted Topshop asking for products for her to 
wear.

'We note that six of these requests post-date this dispute,' the barrister said.

'Shopping habits': Employees of Rihanna, seen wearing a Topshop jumper last year, have asked for clothes for the singer since she launched legal proceedings, the retailer's lawyers said

The T-shirt in question is printed with a snap of the star wearing a bra top, which she says was 'very similar' to images used on one of her album covers.

She
 claims sales of the shirt amounted to 'passing off' and may have led to
 her reputation being tarnished with her fans, had they bought the 
garment thinking it was 'genuine' endorsed merchandise with 'an 
emotional connection to their heroine'.

Lawyers for Topshop maintain the retailer did nothing wrong, and accuse the pop star of making an unjustifiable bid to establish a 'free standing image right' over use of her picture in the UK.

Mr Justice Birss, sitting at London's High Court, heard that Topshop bought a licence to use the image on the T-shirt from the photographer who took it, during the video shoot for Rihanna's single We Found Love which was filmed in Belfast and Bangor, Northern Ireland, in November 2011.

However the 25-year-old singer protested that they had short changed her and her fans when the T-shirt went on sale.

The judge was shown the controversial tank-top T-shirt, showing the singer in a pale bra top with her hair in an up-do, as part of a 'wall of T-shirts' displayed to the court on coat hangers in evidence today.

Martin Howe QC, for Rihanna, who is suing Topshop's owners, Arcadia Brands Limited under her real name, Robyn Rihanna Fenty, told the court: 'Rihanna is one of the world's most famous musical performing artists. She needs little introduction.

'Like most well known contemporary performing artists, she engages in merchandising, and like most such performing artists, it represents a significant part of her revenue stream.

'In 2012, Topshop sold a T-shirt displaying a clearly recognisable image of Rihanna taken when she was on a video shoot. She was wearing her makeup and hairdo for the video shoot, and very similar images of her appeared on her CD inlay (for the album Talk that Talk.)

'The sales...gave rise to a likelihood of deception, damaging Rihanna's goodwill.

'A substantial number of people buying, or even seeing, those T-shirts would think they are approved or somehow connected with Rihanna, when, in fact, they were not approved of or connected with her at all.

'This will be particularly so amongst the group of most likely purchasers of those T-shirts, namely fans of Rihanna.

'We are saying that one of the qualities of the T-shirt is the mere fact of whether it has been endorsed or not, and is a genuine object, emanating from the source of the fans' affection.

'It is not so much a concern about the quality of the item, but it not having the emotional attachment to the heroine and (for fans) the desire to own the actual item issued by their heroine.

Claims: Topshop was selling a T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of Rihanna's face she claims is 'very similar' to one of her album covers

'Rihanna's case is not about stopping the sale of all images of her on T-shirts in the UK, nor is it about trying to create a free standing so-called image right in the UK. Passing off is a question of fact in each case.

'Topshop accepts that Rihanna has generated goodwill as a musical performing artist. It denies that she has any goodwill in any other area.

'Rihanna's case is that she has generated reputation and goodwill beyond that as a musical performing artist (which) extends into the fashion and clothing industries and has done so for years.

'She has collaborated in the design of clothes with a range of clothing designers at the high end of fashion, including Giorgio Armani and Gucci, and at established high street fashion stores, including River Island.

'These garments were not only endorsed by her but were sold and labelled under Rihanna's name and trademark. These ranges were highly acclaimed,' the barrister said.

Mr Howe concluded by saying that Rihanna is seeking a 'blanket injunction' preventing Topshop from offering for sale any clothing bearing her image.

Geoffrey Hobbs QC, for Topshop, responded that, having bought a licence to use the image from the photographer who took it, the fashion giants were fully entitled to sell the T-shirt.

'We resist the claim on two main bases; first, this is, in substance and reality, an impermissible attempt by Rihanna to establish an image reproduction right in the UK. There is no such right.

'On the contrary, Topshop are entitled honestly to sell the garment, having obtained the necessary copyright licence.

'Secondly there is no representation here, given that the garment is fashion wear and not promotional merchandise.'

The hearing, set to last until next week, continues.
