Despite expectations that he will serve half of his 17-year jail term, Paul Mosley has asked the Court of Appeals to shorten his sentence

Paul Mosley has asked for his 17-year prison sentence for his role in killing Jade, Duwayne,John, Jack, Jesse, and Jayden Philpott, to be reduced.

The announcement comes one day after Mairead Philpott's legal team appealed to the Court of Appeal to cut her 17-year jail term.

Mairead Philpott, 32 her husband Mick, 56 and their friend Paul Mosley, 46 were all convicted of manslaughter last month.

They started a house fire in Derby, which claimed the lives of the six children who were sleeping upstairs.

It is believed that Mick Philpott, who was given a life sentence, 
is also considering an appeal.

Barrister
Clive Stockwell, who spoke for Mosley during the seven-week trial, 
today said: 'We have lodged an application with the Court of 
Appeal for leave to appeal the length of the sentence.'

Mairead Philpott's appeal against her
jail sentence has been criticised by her father Jim Duffy, who said he 
was 'disappointed' by the news.

He said: 'Appealing like this will just drag 
everything back up and cause a lot of upset to the family.

'It will cost 
tax payers a lot of money to get it through the appeal court, there will
be a lot of bad feeling and I don't think she will succeed. I'm 
disappointed by it. She should just get on with her sentence.

'I don't think it was too long, she should have got as long as Mick for what she did.

'Six little children lost their lives and nothing will change that.'

Mrs Philpott's barrister, Shaun Smith QC said: 'The reaction to the sentence is we think it was too long, and so we are going to see whether or not we can persuade the Court of Appeal to reduce the sentence.

Mairead (pictured with husband Mick) was told that she ignored 'obvious' risks to her children's safety and is said to have been in a 'horrendous relationship' with her husband

'Mairead was instrumental in killing six children but we feel her role in the killing of the six children was not as substantial as the trial judge has assessed so we will have to wait and see what the Court of Appeal says.'

Jade Philpott, 10, and her brothers Duwayne, 13, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six and Jayden, five, died from the effects of smoke inhalation following the blaze on May 11 last year.

Their parents, along with Mosley, all denied starting the fire, which the prosecution said was 'a plan that went tragically wrong' - aimed at framing Philpott's former live-in mistress Lisa Willis.

But following a trial at Nottingham Crown Court, a jury found the trio guilty of six counts of manslaughter.

A spokeswoman for Derbyshire police said the force would not comment.

'Any appeal against the sentence is a matter for the courts. It would be inappropriate for the police to comment on the reports,' she said.

Earlier this month, Jim Duffy completed a 100-mile walk from Skegness to Derby to raise money for Catch Me When I Fall, a Derby organisation that helps families of sick children.

Mr Duffy was one of 12 walkers who finished the walk on Saturday May 11 - exactly one year after the fire.

It culminated in a fun day held at Osmaston Park in Derby, which began with the releasing of six white doves into the air.
