An 80-year-old professor claims he was told to clean his own toilet while he was crippled with pneumonia in hospital.

Joseph Cummins, a professor of genetics, made a complaint to the hospital after his unpleasant and humiliating ordeal; but the centre has denied that it happened.

The story has stunned a local politician who claims the incident happened because of cut backs in hospital staff.

Investigation: The Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario is investigating why an 80-year-old patient had to clean his own toilet

Mr Cummins was admitted to hospital after being treated at the emergency department at London Health Sciences Centre, in Ontario.

He was suffering from pneumonia following a recent trip to the UK.  

Staff at the emergency department gave Mr Cummins antibiotics and a strong laxative before taking him to a ward.

But due to the medication, the Western University professor said he had an 'accident' as he reached the bathroom and needed help to clean the toilet.

He went looking for hospital staff but could only find a man who delivered patients' breakfast that day.

Appalled: Politician Andrea Harworth, leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), blamed government cuts for insufficient staffing levels at the time

Speaking to The Star, Mr Cummins said: 'He sort of wandered down the hall and then came back later and told me I had to learn to control my bowels . . . and then I did my best to clean it up.'

He added: '...it was no easy matter because at that time I was crippled,'

Unwell and distraught, Mr Cummins did his best to deal with the problem using paper towels.

He went on to spend four more days in the hospital before being discharged to continue his recovery at home.

A week later, once he was better, he reported his experience to the centre's patient complaints office, but was shocked by the hospital's response.

The hospital denied that the incident had happened.

Tony LaRocca, vice-president of community and stakeholder relations at the hospital, said in a written statement that, according to a subsequent investigation, the incident never happened.

'All we can say is that we have no record of any such incident ever occurring at our hospital, and simply put, we would never ask a patient to do their own cleaning.'

The letter, quoted in The Star, says the hospital has highly trained environmental service workers ready to be dispatched to deal with required clean-ups in any part of the hospital.

Appalled at the treatment, politician Andrea Harworth, leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), blamed government cuts for insufficient staffing levels at the time.

She said it was an 'absolute disgrace' Mr Cummins had to clean his own toilet, which he shared with one other patient.

She criticised Ontario's Health Minister Deb Matthews for the poor quality of care.

Ms Matthews told The Star the incident was 'completely unacceptable' and was being investigated.
