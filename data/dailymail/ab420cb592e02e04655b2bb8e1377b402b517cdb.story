'Trauma': A friend of Mairead Philpott claims she has not eaten since being jailed for her role in the deaths of her children

The wife of Mick Philpott has not eaten since she was jailed for her role in the botched arson plot that claimed the lives of six of the couples' children, it has been claimed.

Mairead Philpott, 32, who was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 17 years in prison on Thursday, is believed to have been subjected to a barrage of threats from fellow inmates at New Hall women's prison in West Yorkshire, where she is said to be on 24-hour suicide watch.

A friend of the woman, who was convicted alongside her husband Mick Philpott and their friend Paul Mosley at Nottingham Crown Court, has said she has refused food since she was convicted as a result of the 'trauma'.

'She's been refusing to eat since she was convicted because of the trauma of it all and the threats,' the friend told the Sun newspaper.

'She
has been bombarded with threats and is terrified,' added the source, 
who said Mairead was being held in part of the West Yorkshire prison 
that is segregated from other inmates.

The Ministry of Justice said today it did not comment on individual prisoners.

Mick Philpott, who was sentenced to 
life imprisonment at Nottingham Crown Court last week, is at high 
security Wakefield Prison, where he is also reported to be on suicide 
watch.

The husband and 
wife were convicted of plotting together to frame his former lover Lisa 
Willis in a bid to win a bitter custody battle.

But the plan went disastrously wrong and the Philpotts and Mosley were all found guilty of killing Jade Philpott, 10, and her brothers John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, Jayden, five, and Duwayne, 13, in the fire at their home in Victory Road, Allenton, Derby, last May.

A judge told Mick Philpott he had 'no moral compass', adding that he was a 'disturbingly dangerous man'.

Guilty: The Philpotts were taken away from Nottingham Crown Court in prison vans after being convicted of manslaughter last week

Plot: Mick Philpott was jailed along with wife Mairead and Paul Mosley following the deaths of Duwayne, 13, Jade, 10, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five
