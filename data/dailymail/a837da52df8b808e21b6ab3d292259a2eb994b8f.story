Leon Brittan gained a double first from Trinity College, Cambridge before becoming a lawyer, MP, minister and EU commissioner

Leon Brittan was today hailed as 'by far and away the most brilliant of his generation' after a stellar career which took him from Hampstead to the House of Commons. 

Born on September 25 1939, the son of a north London doctor who had emigrated from Berlin, Brittan was brought up in the Orthodox Jewish tradition.

He won a scholarship from his state primary school to Haberdasher's Aske's School in Hampstead and went to gain a double first from Trinity College, Cambridge. 

At University he became president of the Union and chairman of the Conservative Association.

In 1961, he was called to the Bar and pursued a successful career as a libel lawyer, taking silk in 1978. But his ambitions to enter the House of Commons were frustrated for 10 years.

He fought and lost North Kensington in 1966 and 1970, and was rejected as Tory candidate by more than a dozen safer Tory seats.

Finally, he was elected for Cleveland and Whitby in 1974. Before long he was in Mrs Thatcher's shadow team, first as a deputy spokesman on devolution and then in employment.

When she won the 1979 election, Lord Brittan became minister of state at the Home Office. Within two years he was in the Cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury. Only days before that promotion he married divorcee Diana Peterson, who had two daughters.

In this post, he was an instant success, courteous and decisive and quickly aware of areas where compromises could be successfully reached in his battle to keep public spending under control.

But a cloud on the horizon was the projected disappearance of his parliamentary constituency. Lord Brittan, despite his proven ability, had trouble finding another seat to fight.

But the intervention of the then-home secretary, Willie Whitelaw, helped him to gain the safe seat of Richmond, Yorkshire.

After the 1983 Tory landslide, Brittan became the youngest home secretary since Winston Churchill. But he got off to a bad start when MPs decisively rejected his advice to restore hanging for terrorist murders.

His handling of the Libyan embassy siege brought him back to public favour, and it was at that stage that he became talked about as a possible future leader.

But his apparently unstoppable rise was halted and then reversed by two issues. His decision to ask the BBC not to transmit a programme on Ulster terrorism made him the target of accusations of censorship and of handing the IRA as major propaganda victory.

All this made him a liability and Mrs Thatcher transferred him to trade and industry, which everyone except him regarded as demotion. But within weeks he was caught up in the battle over Westland.

Brittan and the rest of the Cabinet wanted an American rescue package to save the company, while Heseltine alone wanted a European solution, and openly campaigned for one against all his Cabinet colleagues.

There followed the leaked letter and then Brittan was forced to apologise to MPs for allegedly misleading them over a confidential letter to Mrs Thatcher from British Aerospace, part of the European consortium bidding to rescue Westland.

He gained some support with a fighting Commons performance, denying he had lied to the House about an alleged meeting with BAe chief executive Sir Raymond Lygo.

But hours later, Sir Raymond issued a long statement contradicting Brittan's version of events. Later, Sir Raymond amended that by saying there had been a 'misunderstanding'.

It was too late. The 1922 Committee of Tory back-benchers demanded his resignation and despite pleas by Mrs Thatcher for him to stay, Brittan had to quit.

But he took this devastating blow with equanimity. 'I am bruised,' he said. 'But I am certainly not bowed. And I'm not looking back, nor in any state of nostalgia.'

Brittan was appointed a European commissioner in 1989 and a year later became vice-president of the Commission.

He stayed in Brussels for a decade and it was during this time he gave the now-Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg a job in his office.

He returned to Westminster in 2000 as Lord Brittan of Spennithorne but remained low key until Prime Minister David Cameron gave him a job as a trade adviser in 2010.

Last year, he was put in the spotlight when allegations of historic sex abuse emerged and Home Secretary Theresa May set up an inquiry to investigate.

Lord Brittan was likely to be called to give evidence over a dossier he received from MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983, documenting the alleged involvement of VIP figures in a child sex ring.

He had flatly denied failing to act on the abuse file.

The second woman appointed to chair the investigation, Fiona Woolf, was forced to quit over links to him - she was a neighbour.

Last July, Lord Brittan confirmed he was interviewed by police about a 'serious allegation', but insisted that the accusation was 'wholly without foundation'.

It followed press reports that he had been questioned under caution by police in connection with an allegation of rape dating back to 1967.

Lord Brittan is survived by a widow and two stepdaughters.
