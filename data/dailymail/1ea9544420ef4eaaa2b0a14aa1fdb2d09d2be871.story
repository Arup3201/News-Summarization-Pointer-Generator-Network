A flasher has been let off undergoing group therapy as part of his punishment, after having a sex change to become a woman.

Stuart Fisher, 47, from Tyneside, was given a community groupwork programme for men after his conviction in 2010 for outraging public decency by behaving in an indecent manner.

But a court has told Fisher he can now undergo the therapy one-to-one with a probation officer after he underwent gender realignment therapy and changed his name to Saralee.

Fisher was arrested for committing a string of offences in Whitley Bay between March and November 2009, while still living as a man.

He was convicted in January 2010 and given a community order with supervision requirements as well as being ordered to undergo group therapy sessions. It's unknown if he was placed on the sex offenders register as part of his punishment.

Since his conviction he made the decision to undergo a sex change - forcing North Tyneside Magistrates Court to reassess his punishment during a hearing last month.

It's thought to be the first time ever officials have been forced to alter the conditions of a sex offender's punishment in this way.

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'The suitability of treatment programmes for offenders is assessed on a case by case basis and the decision to vary a community sentence requirement is a matter for the courts.

'If an offender is not deemed suitable for group courses their offendingÂ  behaviour will still be addressed on a one to one basis with specialist help if required.'

A source close to the case insisted Fisher had not been given a reprieve and that his punishment would just be 'carried out in a different way'.

They added: 'Obviously this is a very unusual case and authorities in the North have never had to deal with a situation like this before.

'The groupwork programme specifically for men so it wasn't suitable for a woman to be on the course.

'As the offender became a woman part way through the course something had to be done.

'There was never a chance that the punishment would be removed - it will just be carried out in a different way.'

But campaigners insist he should be forced to carry out the punishment he was given.

Claire Phillipson, director of Wearside Women in Need, said: 'We have been waiting for this kind of thing to start, and it all stems from the Equality Act 2010 which is a real hot potato at the moment.

'What difference does change in gender make?

'It is irrelevant whether this person has changed gender or is undergoing gender reassignment - they have committed an offence for which they were sentenced by the court.

'A change of name or body does not make them any less dangerous or mean that they should not carry a sentence that the court ordered.'
