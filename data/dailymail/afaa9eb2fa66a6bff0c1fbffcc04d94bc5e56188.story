Even as the biggest sporting event of the year approached, ESPN took a moment to remember its veteran broadcaster, Stuart Scott, who died from cancer earlier last month.

Emotional colleagues shed tears as they described the passion and kindness of their colleague, who died on 4 January at the age of 49. 

Host Suzy Kolber recalled Scott, who covered the Super Bowl for years, holding her baby daughter the day she was born, and how she did the same for his daughter, Taelor.

Touching: Kolber shared this image of Scott holding her daughter Kellyn at her first NFL game, when she was nine months old

Sharing a picture of him holding Kellyn at her first NFL game, she said: 'When Kellyn was nine months old, she came to her very first NFL game - and I just always thought that picture was magical.

'So, what will I miss the most? He was universally known for his hugs? Strong, meaningful and filled with love.'

'We can't replace that, but we were happy we had him in our lives. But the legacy lives on, which of course is what Stuart was all about too.'

Kolber and Scott had a 20-year working relationship.

Another host said: 'We were grateful for the spirit of Stu, it was undaunted, indomitable, and we're grateful'. 

The ESPN hosts also reminded viewers of Scott's fund with the Jimmy V Foundation foundation, dedicated to helping disadvantaged groups fight cancer.

During his career at the network, which began in 1993, Scott covered practically every major sporting event.

He interviewed sporting heroes like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods - as well as scoring a segment with Barack Obama, whom he played at basketball in the run-up to his 2008 victory.

President Obama issued a tribute to Scott on the day that he died, revealing his ESPN shows often kept him entertained on the campaign trail.

He was diagnosed with cancer in 2007, and became a figurehead in his struggle with a disease, inspiring many. However, he never revealed what kind of cancer he was fighting.

Scott was noted for carrying on working even in some of the worst periods of his disease.

On the day of his death, ESPN president John Skipper described Scott as 'a true friend and a uniquely inspirational figure' and that his 'energetic and unwavering devotion to his family and to his work while fighting the battle of his life left us in awe, and he leaves a void that can never be replaced.'

He continued: 'Who engages in mixed martial arts training in the midst of chemotherapy treatments? Who leaves a hospital procedure to return to the set?'

Scott was survived by his parents, O. Ray and Jacqueline Scott; siblings Stephen Scott, Synthia Kearney and Susan Scott; his daughters Taelor, 19, and Sydni, 15; and girlfriend Kristin Spodobalski.
