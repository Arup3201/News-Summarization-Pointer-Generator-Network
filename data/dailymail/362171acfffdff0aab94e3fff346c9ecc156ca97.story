A mosquito species that can transmit both yellow fever and the dengue virus has been spotted in California.Â 

The species, known as the aedes aegypti, is known for its dark color with white markings around its legs, Medical Daily reports. It adds that unlike other mosquitoes, it prefers to bite people during all hours of the day, as opposed to only at night.

The mosquitoes are extremely difficult to contain because they need as little as a teaspoon of water to lay their eggs, the website adds.

The insects' impact would be enormous for California residents, Tim Phillips of the Fresno Mosquito and Vector Control District told the Associated Press.

'If it gets away it will change the way we live in California. You may not be able to sit on your patio and enjoy a cup of coffee during the day without getting bit,' he said.

The Associated Press adds that so far none of the mosquitoes trapped and examined in Clovis, California have carried diseases. Officials are concerned, however, that if they bite someone infected, there could be an outbreak.

California officials are concerned about the potential spread of aedes aegypti mosquitoes, like the one seen in this file photo. Florida has battled an outbreak earlier this year

There have been approximately 200 cases of dengue fever since 2010, the Associated Press continues. Health officials think this outbreak of mosquitoes could have originated from eggs on containers imported into the country.

The Las Vegas Guardian Express reports the California is a prime target for the mosquitoes' attack, since they die in cold weather.

In September NPR reported that health officials in Florida were trying to control a dengue fever outbreak spread by the mosquitoes. Until 2009 when there was a Key West outbreak, dengue fever hadn't been seen in Florida for over 70 years.

Dengue fever symptoms, The San Francisco Chronicle writes, include including high temperature, headaches and intense pain in muscles, joints and bones. Severe cases can lead to capillaries leaking, with patients dying from circulatory failure.

Symptoms for yellow fever, the Chronicle says, include fever, headaches, and body aches. More severe symptoms may develop, including bleeding and death. While there is no specific treatment for yellow fever, there is a vaccine.

Countries in other parts of the world, like the Paraguay patients seen here, frequently combat dengue, which is spread by the mosquitoes
