A Melbourne teenager remains in an induced coma after he was struck in an alleged one-punch attack, resulting from a road rage incident while out with friends on Halloween.

Diane Toulson says her 16 year old son, Brock, was 'king hit' while walking home from a Halloween party in Knoxfield, in Melbourne's south east, and was taken to Melbourne's Alfred hospital with a brain bleed. 

'I think we are very lucky that Brock's alive,' she told 3AW. 

'He was hit once. He did go straight to the ground. We were very lucky there was a person behind so his head actually landed on his foot instead of the concrete pavement.'

Overseas at the time of the attack, Ms Toulson had to cut her holiday short and try to get back to Australia.

She wrote on her facebook account, ' I am scared and panicked. Please send him everything you have.'

She said her son and two other friends had been drinking before they left the party at Knoxsville and were attacked by a man driving past.

Ms Toulson told Fairfax radio a car swerved at them before her son yelled out 'you're an idiot', and the driver jumped out and punched Brock in the face.

He was then taken to Alfred hospital in a serious condition, his current condition is critical but stable.

When Daily Mail contacted, Brock's brother, Cory, he said the family wanted to keep comments to a minimal and concentrate efforts on providing Brock the support he needed.

'I will say he is stable and we're working towards getting him into a better position, but it's a long road to recovery and we have a very difficult time ahead,' said Cory.

An update on Ms Toulson's facebook page on Sunday said Brock was stable and that his injuries were under control.

'The current problem is he is too aggressive to wake up which they say is normal after sustaining this type of injury and severe concussion,' she said.

'He has a few fractures in skull that will repair naturally, a fractured nose and a few brain bleeds but they are under control.'

She also thanked staff at the hospital saying they were fantastic and that he was being well cared for. 

'We are strategising on how to wake him up tomorrow and the next few weeks will see if there will be any ongoing or permanent damage.'

'We are just glad he is ok and will work towards getting him back on his feet and functioning.' 

Police confirmed that at 11:20pm on Friday, the driver, a 47 year old man from Ferntree Gully fronted up to the Knox police station soon after the incident, which occurred at the intersection of Scoresby Road and Camden Park Drive, Ferntree Gully.

The man advised police he had just been involved in an altercation, where he confronted two youths allegedly tagging a bus stop.

Police say the man was interviewed in relation to the assault but was released pending further inquiries. 

The disturbing incident came just a night before new laws were put into effect to mandate higher sentences for fatal one punch attacks.  

One-punch killers face at least 10 years in prison for manslaughter if they punch a victim to the head and it results in death.

Police are also urging any witnesses who have any information regarding Friday's incident to contact Crime Stoppers.
