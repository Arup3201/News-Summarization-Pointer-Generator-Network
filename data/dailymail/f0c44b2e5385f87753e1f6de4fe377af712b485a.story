The star of the Yorkie bar TV adverts was yesterday spared jail for killing his wife after a judge noted his ‘praiseworthy’ life.

Retired actor Stuart Mungall, 71, smothered 69-year-old Joan Mungall with a pillow in what he said was a mercy killing.

He was a devoted carer for his wife of 43 years who was left bedbound and in pain by Pick’s disease, which is like Alzheimer’s.

Relief: Stuart Mungall, with an unidentified female, leaves the Old Bailey after being given a 12-month sentence suspended for two years after he pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his ill wife Joan

'Needed to be put down': Joan Mungall, 69, was suffering from Pick's disease, a rare form of dementia

In July, the prosecution accepted his plea of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

He said the strain of caring for his wife for two years had made him clinically depressed.

Mungall, who starred as a trucker in 
the chocolate bar commercials during the Seventies, killed his wife on 
December 3 last year at their home in Tooting, South London.

When police were called, he said: ‘Doctors say do this and that but they cannot make it better, so I made it better.’

Yesterday at the Old Bailey, he 
received a 12-month sentence suspended for two years. Judge Peter 
Beaumont, the Recorder of London, told him:

‘You were caring for her most basic 
needs with unstinting devotion. You come before the court as a man who 
has had a praiseworthy life.

‘You have earned the plaudits of all who have known you.’

He said Mungall’s plea to manslaughter ‘reduces your responsibility but does not extinguish it’.

Fame: Mr Mungall played a lorry driver in adverts for Yorkie during the 1970s

The actor was also placed under 
supervision for two years and the judge ordered regular reports so that 
any recurrence of his illness could be 'nipped in the bud'.

Asked if he understood the sentence, Mungall replied: 'Yes, I do.'

His wife, who was also an actress and 
had worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company, was left unable to move. 
Doctors believed she had only months to live and Mungall 'snapped'.

The Old Bailey had heard Mungall describe Mrs Mungall as looking into his eyes 'like an animal who needs to be put 
down and cannot say it'.

Miranda Moore, QC, defending, said Mungall had served the equivalent of six months in custody before being granted bail.

She said: 'They were totally devoted to each other. They were each other's lives.

'At the time of her death, she had weeks to live. She was keen to stay in her own home with her husband.'

But
in an earlier court appearance the prosecution said the actor should be 
jailed, insisting the ill actress had given no indication she wanted to 
die and only the day 
before her killing had been 'typically upbeat and in a positive mood'.

After
police were called to the couple's home on December 3 last year, 
Mungall told officers: 'She's not in pain any more. She was in such 
pain last night

Outside 
court, Mungall's solicitor, Laurence Imrie, said: 'Mr Mungall would like
this opportunity to thank all of those who have provided overwhelming 
support during this particularly difficult time.

'He is relieved that this matter has finally been concluded and he respects the court's findings.

Pick’s disease is a rare form of dementia that is similar to Alzheimer’s, but which tends to affect only specific areas of the brain.

Named after Arnold Pick – a professor from the University of Prague who first described it in 1892 – it causes a slow shrinking of brain cells due to excess protein build-up.

Patients initially show marked personality and behavioural changes, and then memory loss and a decline in speech.

The disease accounts for just 5 per cent of all progressive dementias.

But it is frequently misdiagnosed in the early stages as depression, mental illness, or Alzheimer’s.

There is no cure, although antidepressants help manage mood swings, and patients often die within ten years.

'Joan is at peace now and without pain. The family now request that their privacy be respected whilst they continue to grieve.'

The Recorder of London, Judge Peter 
Beaumont, was told there had been fears that Mungall would take his own 
life after being arrested for killing his partner of 40 years.

When a doctor was called to their home after he had smothered his wife, the actor was wearing pyjamas and was drunk, saying he had taken pills.

He was taken to hospital, where his stomach was pumped, later telling medics: 'I couldn't cope any more. I killed her.

The court had earlier heard that Mungall, who 
shared a flat with Sean Connery in the 1960s when they were both unknown
actors, met his wife while working for the RSC. They married in 1967.

The couple gave up acting to run a 
garden centre, but were forced to sell their business in Tooting and a 
holiday home in France after Mrs Mungall developed epilepsy in 2008.

The following year doctors discovered
she was suffering from a degenerative brain condition, although she was
not diagnosed with Pick's until after her death.

The day before she died nurses had found her 'typically upbeat and in a positive mood' during a home visit.

Many of the couple's friends – including actress Jane Asher who spoke at Mrs Mungall's funeral – wrote to the judge to ask for clemency.
