An Illinois high school denied its graduating seniors their diplomas after they threw their caps in the air during their commencement ceremony after they were told not to.

The day after the celebration, staff at Ridgewood High School in Norridge wrote on its website that class representatives would have to apologize for the 'disrespectful and insubordinate behavior' if they wanted the students to receive their diplomas.

Superintendent Dr. Robert Lupo wrote a blog post about the incident to the students at the school, which appropriately has the slogan 'Home of the Rebels', referring to their athletic team.

The blog said the students had been warned against throwing the caps because the age-old tradition was dangerous that could leave students 'with cuts and black eyes'.

'It was a simple instruction,' he wrote. '"Please do 
not throw the caps or there will be consequences."  The graduates heard 
this and made their choice to mar what should have been a joyous event.

'Perhaps it is the final lesson they will take away from 
high school: there are consequences for behaviors in life. If you are 
unwilling to face those consequences, perhaps you should rethink your 
actions.'

The blog has since been removed and after the decision sparked outcry - with many students saying the school were being unfair or taking the celebration too seriously - the school reversed its decision.

'Regarding the distribution of diplomas; we recognize that most of those who participated in the graduation ceremonies were well-behaved and followed instructions,' an announcement said.

Anger: Supt. Dr. Robert Lupo said they needed to know there were consequences for their actions

'I am sorry that the ceremony was marred by a few students who chose not to follow those instructions.

'Consequently, we have re-thought our policy and will be sending out diplomas to all members of the class of 2014 today.'

The students have previously expressed their disappointment after school staff refused to hand out diplomas.

'I just think it’s really ridiculous,' Jackie Rios told WMAQ. 'We worked so hard to get to this point.'

'It was kind of silly that they would request them not to,' parent Mary Sticha added. 'It wasn't a way to disrespect anyone, it was just a way to do something together and celebrate the end of the year.'

Comments on Lupo's blog also called the decision 'the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard'.

'Maybe it is you, Dr. Lupo, that needs to grow up,' the comment said.

But other commenters agreed with the decision, with one saying: 'Children need to learn from their actions. And at this point they are still children. Grow up.'

Before the reversal, the students were told that they could collect their diplomas if class representatives apologized at a meeting on June 4. This is no longer necessary.
