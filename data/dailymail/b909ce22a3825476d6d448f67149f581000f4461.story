A young disabled boy was left smiling this afternoon, after getting a hug from the Countess of Wessex during her visit to his school.

After laying a hand imploringly on her arm, the little boy, who attends the Royal School for Deaf Children in Margate, was treated to a warm embrace from the royal.

Sophie then crouched down for a chat, much to the delight of the wheelchair-bound boy, school staff and his parents.

But the youngster wasn't the only one to get a hug from the Countess. One of his classmates also got a cuddle, leaving him, like his friend, with a face wreathed in smiles.

Sophie, who is the school's patron, was there to open a new hydrotherapy pool, disability gym and cafe complex but spent most of the visit getting to know the children.

Dressed in a chic cream suit teamed with a pair of the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite L.K Bennett 'Sledge' heels, the 49-year-old was every inch the royal style icon as she toured the school.

Admiring though the looks directed her way were, this was a visit that really was all about the children and a cause close to Sophie's heart.

A long standing supporter of charities dedicated to disability, along with the school, she is also patron of Brainwave, which funds therapy for youngsters with physical difficulties, the Disability Initiative and Dyslexia Action.

Earlier, the Countess had spent the morning raising the profile of another cause close to her heart, the plight of people suffering from cancer.

In Tunbridge Wells, she visited the local hospital, being shown around the decontamination unit before officially unveiling a memorial to staff who perished during the First World War.

Afterwards, she was driven to the nearby Pickering Cancer Drop-in Centre, which helps support anyone affected by the disease.

The visit came in the wake of a busy month for Sophie, who has spent most of it touring the country and hosting charity suppers at Buckingham Palace.

Next month is also set to be an engagement-packed one, with a visit to Buckinghamshire, including a tour of the spinal injuries unit at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, among the highlights.

Her husband, Prince Edward, also has plenty in his diary, starting with a trip to Birmingham early next week.

Neither, however, can beat the Princess Royal when it comes to exotic visits, with the Queen's only daughter scheduled to spend two days travelling in Tanzania and Ethiopia next week on behalf of the Vine Trust and Save the Children.
