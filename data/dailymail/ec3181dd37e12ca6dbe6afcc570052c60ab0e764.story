More than a month after the death of cricketer Phillip Hughes, his best friend has refused to celebrate the festive season without remembering his 25-year-old 'brother'.

Australian skipper Michael Clarke took to social media on New Year's Eve to pay tribute to the man from Macksville, in northern New South Wales, who tragically couldn't be there to celebrate the occasion with him.

A picture posted to the 33-year-old's Instagram account at about 4:30pm, showed a glass and bottle of red wine flanked by two burning Phillip Hughes tribute candles.

'Been a tough year, bring on 2015. May it be the best year of your life #family&friends,' Clarke wrote in the picture caption.

Clarke and his wife Kyly also shared similar tributes for their friend on Christmas Day.

'Today you will have Christmas with us bro,' Clarke wrote in a post shared by his wife. The words were accompanied by a photograph of a Phillip Hughes tribute candle and a framed photograph of the three sharing an evening on the town.

Hughes was struck in the head by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match at the Sydney Cricket Ground on November 25. 

He never recovered from the blow and died two days later, surrounded by friends at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney's inner-east.

'How blessed we were to call you ours': Michael and Kyly Clarke also posted this Christmas tribute to their late friend

'Rest in peace, my little brother. I'll see you out in the middle': Clarke's eloquent address at Hughes' funeral was widely praised

The life of the star cricketer, known to his family as 'Boof', was celebrated at an emotional memorial service in Macksville a week later.  

Clarke's eloquent eulogy to his fallen 'little brother' at the service was widely praised.

The Australian captain said he could scarcely believe the young star had been 'taken from the game and from his loved ones at the age of 25'. 

'His spirit is still with me and I hope it never leaves,' he told assembled mourners, before adding that Hughes' soul would act as a 'custodian of the sport we all love'. 

'We must listen to it, we must cherish it, we must learn from it, we must dig in ... we must dig in and get through to tea. And we must play on. 

'So rest in peace, my little brother, I'll see you out in the middle.'

In a social media tribute following the service, Kyly Clarke reflected on memories the trio had shared together. 

'Our Xmas lunch buddy, a friend we trust, our trivia night partner, the guy who was never fussed!' 

'WE LOVE YOU HUGH DOG, LIFE WONT BE THE SAME, HERE'S TO THE DAY WE SEE YOU AGAIN!'

Clarke has been publicly open about his grief for Hughes from the first moment. 

His tearful speeches, both at his best mate's funeral service and during a statement after his death was first announced, touched the hearts of  Australians across the country.

Kyly Clarke called Hughes 'my little Italian brother and our tour mate. Our Xmas lunch buddy, a friend we trust, our trivia partner, the guy who never was fussed!'

Clarke's social media accounts were flooded with photo tributes to his fallen best friend after the tragic incident. 'We were the KINGS of Trivia Night.. Hahahahahahahahaha,' one post read, while another stated simply: 'What I would give for just one more day'

He also penned a tribute to Hughes that featured in The Sunday Telegraph on what would have been his 26th birthday on November 29, in which he wrote: 'I don't have a blood brother, but I am very proud to have called Phillip my brother. I am a better man for having known him'.

The tribute recalled the first moment Clarke met the country boy and spoke of his humble nature and determination.

Clarke's social media accounts were also flooded with photo tributes to his fallen best friend after the tragic incident in which he shared some of their past activities.

'We were the KINGS of Trivia Night.. Hahahahahahahahaha,' one post read, while another stated simply: 'What I would give for just one more day'.
