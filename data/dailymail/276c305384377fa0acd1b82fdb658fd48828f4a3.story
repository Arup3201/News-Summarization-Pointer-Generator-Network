A pub league football referee was bludgeoned to death after he ruled a goal was offside during a friendly match in Zimbabwe.

Isaac Mbofana, 34, died on the spot after a fan battered him around the head with a log during the heated game last week.

The country’s Chronicle newspaper reported that Mr Mbofana had been running the line as an assistant referee when he ruled a goal was disallowed during the social match on a primary school playing field.

Police said a group of local fans reacted angrily to the decision, with one allegedly picking up part of a tree trunk and attacking the linesman by the pitch side.

Spokeswoman Thandiwe Khumalo confirmed officers had launched a murder probe following the incident, which happened last Thursday in the central village of Takawira.

She said: 'It is alleged that on the said date there was a soccer tournament at Jomboringo Primary School.

'The teams clashed at about 3pm and the now deceased Mbofana was an assistant referee in that match.'

The Chronicle reported that officers have named a local man Onismo Sichani, 31, as the main suspect in the murder.

The government-controlled publication reported: 'Sgt Khumalo said during the course of the game, Sichani’s team scored a goal and Mbofana disallowed the goal arguing that it had been scored from an offside position.

'She said the ruling did not go down well with Sichani who then confronted Mbofana.'

The officer confirmed detectives were hunting Sichani, who allegedly fled following the bloody attack.

She said: 'A misunderstanding ensued between the two resulting in Sichani picking up a log, which he used to strike Mbofana once on the head.

'Mbofana fell down and died instantly. After realising that Mbofana was dead, Sichani fled from the scene.

'The matter was reported to the police who attended the scene and the body of the deceased was taken to Gokwe South District Hospital mortuary for a post-mortem.'

Sergeant Khumalo urged members of the local community to come forward if they had information on the suspect’s whereabouts.

She added: 'Police are appealing to members of the public with information, which might lead to the arrest of Onismo Sichani to contact their nearest police station or use our suggestion boxes.'

The officer, who is acting spokesperson for Zimbabwe’s Midlands force, said people should not resort to violence during disputes.

She said: 'We urge members of the public to always seek assistance from third parties in settling disputes to avoid such incidences.'
