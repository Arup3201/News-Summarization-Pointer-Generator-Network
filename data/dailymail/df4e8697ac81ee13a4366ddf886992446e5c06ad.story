Nearly 1,000 homes every month are now being sold for more than £1million.

Figures reveal that around 30 houses a day are changing hands for seven figure sums – up two-thirds on a year ago.

And all regions of the country have seen property prices jump over the past year, according to the latest data from the Land Registry.

House prices are rising at 6.7 per cent - the highest rate for four years. But   homes in London went up by 17 per cent in the 12 months to April

So what does £1million buy? A grand Victorian hotel in Torquay (left) offers 25 bedrooms, landscaped gardens and coastline views. Or you could go for a four-bed, 2,500 square foot clock tower flat in Manchester (right)

In Central London £1million buys a ‘spacious’ studio flat off Oxford Street … measuring a mere 431 sq ft (left), or a 1,034 sq ft, three-bed ground floor flat with garden and off-road parking in nearby Richmond (right)

Their report will fuel fears that a 
dangerous house price bubble is developing in some areas, particularly 
London and the South East.

The
 figures show 836 houses changed hands for at least £1million in England
 and Wales in February – up 65 per  cent from 507 in the same month last
 year. Experts predict the number will soon exceed 1,000.

It
 is already significantly higher than the 740 homes a month, or 24 a 
day, which sold for at least £1million at the peak of the pre-recession 
boom in 2007. In 2004, just 11 homes a day were changing hands for seven
 figures.

The Land Registry 
also said the average house price across England and Wales rose 6.7 per 
cent in the 12 months to April to hit £172,069 – the biggest increase 
for four years.

All regions 
have seen prices jump over the past year, from a 17 per cent rise in 
London to a 2.9 per cent increase in the North East. Seven in ten of the
 £1million-plus properties sold in February were in London, where the 
average price of a house has leapt to £435,034. It rose by 4.2 per cent 
in April alone – the biggest one month increase since records began in 
1995.

The recent property boom has raised fears of a house price bubble which could derail the economic recovery if it is not controlled

Outside London, the 
most expensive areas are Windsor and Maidenhead, where the average house
 costs £366,333, and Surrey at £328,328. And after the capital, prices 
are rising fastest in Oldham, where they are up 12.1 per cent. But the 
average home there still costs just £82,845, the report shows.

The
 most expensive area of London is the exclusive Royal Borough of 
Kensington and Chelsea, where a typical home sells for £1.27million. 
Meanwhile, prices are rising fastest in Waltham Forest in the north-east
 of the capital, where they soared 26.2 per cent to £323,288 in the year
 to April.

Several areas of 
Northern England also saw significant year-on-year price increases, with
 a 5.5 per cent rise in Yorkshire and the Humber pushing the average 
house price to £120,118.

The
 North West has seen growth of 3.8 per cent, taking the typical value to
 £112,064, and in Wales, prices have increased by 3 per cent over the 
past year to reach £117,581 on average.

The Government has introduced a Help to Buy scheme to make it easier for youngsters with big enough salaries to afford mortgages but are not able raise deposits to get a loan. But critics say runaway house prices are making homes unaffordable 

Experts
 said the property boom is extending beyond London as the economic 
recovery and the Government’s controversial Help to Buy scheme boost 
demand – and predicted the number of properties selling for at least 
£1million would ‘increase nationwide’.

David
 Newnes, director of estate agents Your Move and Reeds Rains, said: ‘The
 housing market recovery has spread  its wings out from London and the 
South East. Help to Buy has been instrumental – its impact has been felt
 most strongly in  the North West and East.’

Stuart Law, chief 
executive of Manchester-based property company Assetz, said: ‘The ripple
 effect from London is now clearly benefiting the regional markets with 
blanket annual property price growth across the country. We would expect
 to see sales of £1million plus properties increasing nationwide.’

But
 Dr Howard Archer, chief UK economist at research group IHS Global 
Insight, warned: ‘It is certainly justifiable to talk of a house price 
bubble in London … and the risk of a general housing market bubble 
developing is very real.’

Matthew
 Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics, said London had 
‘taken off’, but elsewhere ‘the bigger picture is that prices are making
 steady gains rather than accelerating’.
