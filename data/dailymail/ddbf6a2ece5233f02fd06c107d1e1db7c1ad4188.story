The brother of a British teacher found murdered in Bali said that she had only been in the country for five days before she died.

Anne-Marie Drozdz, 49, was discovered dead on the floor of her holiday apartment on Friday with a black cloth over her face.

Police believe that she may have been strangled after returning to the property and disturbing an intruder.

Anne Marie Drozdz, a spinster, who was originally from Hinckley, Leicestershire, had spent much of the last 20 years teaching around the world as well as travelling

The spinster, who was originally from Hinckley, Leicestershire, had spent much of the last 20 years teaching around the world as well as travelling, her brother Gregory said yesterday.

Mr Drozdz, 55, a delivery driver who lives with wife Margaret in the Leicestershire town, said: ‘Ever since Anne-Marie qualified as a teacher he plan was to travel and work abroad. She started in Namibia, then Columbia and Turkey and for the last five years had been teaching in Vietnam. She loved the Far East and was very knowledgeable on it.

‘We only found out she had moved to Bali when the Foreign Office called us with the dreadful news on Friday evening. I hadn’t seen Anne-Marie since our father’s funeral in 2008, but we kept in touch via email.

'We believe she planned to set up a social enterprise, helping young people to express themselves through music and drama. She had taken a year out from teaching – she had obviously found a project that she believed in.’

Mr Drozdz and brother Peter, 54, were yesterday waiting for further information on the progress of the Indonesian police investigation.

Police have said the door to Miss Drozdz’s flat had been forced and there were ‘dried-up pools of blood on the floor’ when she was discovered by the husband of her landlady.  A local builder has been arrested.

Mr Drozdz added: ‘We are still trying to come to terms with our grief but I will be contacting the Foreign Office early next week in order to start to talk through the practicalities [about bringing the body of Miss Drozdz home].

‘The family just want the authorities over there to vigorously investigate what has happened, and how our sister met her terrible fate.’
