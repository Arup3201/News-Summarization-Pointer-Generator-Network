Schoolchildren in the UK are still far behind their peers in other countries despite the money pumped into the education system by successive Governments.

The results of international tests published today reveal that Britain's performance has not improved over the past three years, with countries such as Japan and Singapore leading the global league tables.

Business leaders said the disappointing figures should be a 'wake-up call', adding: 'School leavers in the UK are among the least literate and numerate in the developed world.'

Poor performance: Britain is lagging behind many other countries in education league tables

The tests, part of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), measure the achievement of 15-year-olds in maths, science and reading.

The latest results show that girls are far behind boys in maths lessons, with female pupils less likely to enjoy studying the subject.

And figures from Wales are particularly worrying, as its students performed worse on every measure than those in other parts of the UK.

Wales is falling behind the rest of the UK in reading, maths and science, the new league tables show.

The nation's teenagers scored lower results on average in each of the three subjects than their counterparts in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland.

Scotland leads the way in the UK in maths and reading, while England is ahead in science.

The figures show that 15-year-olds in Wales scored 468 points on average, compared with 498 in Scotland, 495 in England and 487 in Northern Ireland.

In reading, Scotland scored 506 points on average, England scored 500, Northern Ireland 498 and Wales 480.

In science, England's average points score was 516, compared with 513 in Scotland, 507 in Northern Ireland and 491 in Wales.

The OECD report concluded that for each of the three subjects, 'performance in Wales was lower than the rest of the United Kingdom'.

The results come despite the billions of pounds invested in education by Labour, and the decision by the Coalition to 'ring-fence' Britain's schools budgets while making deep cuts in other public services.

Education Secretary Michael Gove blamed the disappointing figures on the previous Government, but his Labour opposite number Tristram Hunt said it showed the importance of improving the standards of teachers.

The UK is in 26th place for maths, 23rd for reading and 21st for science in the PISA league tables for 2012, which focus on applied skills rather than theoretical knowledge.

The findings show that the UK's average score for maths was 494 and in reading it was 499, roughly average for all countries and on a par with the Czech Republic, France and Norway.

Britain did better in science with an above-average 514 points, similar to Australia, Ireland and Slovenia.

However, on every measure the country lags behind leading nations including Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and Shanghai in China.

The OECD, which conducts the tests, said that Britain's performance was strikingly similar in 2006 and 2009, the last two times the league table was published.

'In essence you can say that the UK stands where it stood in 2009,' said Andreas Schleicher, special adviser to the OECD's secretary-general.

Business groups were sharply critical of the results, arguing that there is an urgent need to raise the standards in British schools.

Mike Harris, head of education and 
skills at the Institute of Directors, said: 'The generation of young 
people tested for the latest OECD PISA report will be looking for jobs 
in a competitive and unforgiving global race.

'Unfortunately, thanks to historic complacency, the UK appears to have its feet shackled at the starting line.

'We
know from previous OECD skills surveys that, despite billions of pounds
of investment in education over the last 15 years, school leavers in 
the UK are among the least literate and numerate in the developed world.

'This
latest report highlights these historic failings yet again, and raises 
further questions about the UK's attitude to education.'

Girls in the UK perform worse than boys in maths and are less likely to enjoy the subject, according to the results of the PISA tests.

British boys scored an average of 12 points more than girls, a greater gender gap than that seen in most countries.

The findings also show that girls find the subject less enjoyable and are more anxious about studying it.

Overall, 59 per cent of boys said that they are interested in learning maths, compared to 53 per cent of girls.

The study adds that across all OECD countries, greater anxiety about maths is linked to lower scores in the subject.

In the UK, the proportion of students who had high levels of maths anxiety was lower than the OECD average, but girls were more anxious than boys, it says.

Boys also did better than girls in science with a gender gap of 13 points, larger than the OECD average of one point.

But girls performed better in reading, scoring 25 points more on average, significantly less than the OECD's average gender gap of 38 points.

Katja Hall, CBI chief policy director, said: 'High-performing schools are the best way to support economic growth and greater opportunity. These figures should be a wake-up call.

'UK schools are treading water when we know that matching the very best could boost the growth rate by one percentage point every year.

'No issue matters more to the UK economy over the long term than the quality of our education system.'

Britain's poor performance comes despite its above-average spending on education.

The UK spends an average of £59,889 per student, compared to an OECD average of £50,951.

The report shows that around one in eight (12 per cent) of UK teenagers are considered 'top performers' in maths, nine per cent in reading and 11 per cent in science.

By contrast, more than a fifth are 'low performers' in maths, meaning they can only solve the simplest problems.

Mr Gove said: 'These poor results show the last Government failed to secure the improvements in school standards our young people desperately need.

'Labour poured billions of pounds into schools and ratcheted up exam grades - yet our education system stagnated and we fell behind other nations.'

He added that the performance 'underlines the urgent need for our reforms'.

However, Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that only a crackdown on unqualified teachers could boost pupils' performance.

'What we have under this government is a series of policies which lead to the deprofessionalisation of teaching,' the Shadow Education Secretary said.

'It is scandalous that schools can advertise for unqualified teachers.'
