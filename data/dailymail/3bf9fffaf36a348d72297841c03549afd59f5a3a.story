Marie Claire has launched the Take A Good Look campaign to ensure that women are informed, empowered and protected when it comes to cosmetic surgery

As the editor of one of the UK’s leading glossy magazines, and a forty-something woman who wants to look good, I consider myself to be well informed about the beauty industry and the world of cosmetic surgery.

Marie Claire has always prided itself on investigative journalism, in the past we’ve dug into the murky world of cosmetic surgery tourism, and we’ve also reported on the shocking PIP scandal, when it came to light that 45,000 women had given faulty breast implants containing industrial fluid. 

But PIP aside, like most people I had assumed that any surgical procedure that takes place in this country would surely have to be safe, and that if you can walk down your high street and get a shot of botox or some crows feet filled while on the way to do the weekly shop, then surely those products must be licensed or have undergone rigorous testing too?

Yet when I was invited onto Sir Bruce Keogh’s committee to review the regulation of cosmetic interventions, I was truly shocked at how little protection UK consumers have in an industry that’s now worth nearly £3bn a year to our economy. 

This is why Marie Claire has launched the ‘Take A Good Look’ campaign to urge the government to implement the recommendations of the committee as soon as possible to ensure that women are informed, empowered and protected.

And we also want to encourage our readers to take responsibility too: to ask the right questions, do the research and be realistic about the outcomes of any of these procedures, because the truth is, very often they don’t live up to the expectation.

Thanks in part to the glut of real-life makeover shows extolling the virtues of liposuction, fillers and teeth whitening, as well as our bizarre national obsession with programmes like TOWIE, there has been an explosion in the number of cosmetic procedures taking place in the UK over the last five years.

With nine out of ten of those being Botox and dermal fillers, it seems that women as young as 20 are happily incorporating them into their beauty regimes alongside regular manicures and blowdrys.

This huge increase in demand, coupled with a lack of regulation, has encouraged far too many unqualified, dubious characters, looking to make a fast buck to set up in business.

I’ve heard shocking stories about pop-up Botox clinics in places like hairdressers and nightclubs, where young women queue up to sign a consent form, pen in one hand, drink in the other, and then have fillers injected into their lips.

When it goes wrong, as it very easily can do, there is nowhere to turn to for help, and often these women feel too ashamed or embarrassed to take any action. Frequently, it is the good old NHS that has to pick up the tab for putting it right.

And this is just the tip of the iceberg.

When editor Trish Halpin invited onto Sir Bruce Keogh's committee to review the regulation of cosmetic interventions, she was shocked at how little protection UK consumers have

During my time on the review committee, we delved much further, looking in detail at products used for surgical and non-surgical procedures, the people who administer them, the way they are advertised and the advice and support patients and consumers are given before, during and after their treatments.

Our final recommendations, published 
this week, include establishing an implant register with fillers falling
under the same controls as other implants (it was extremely difficult 
to trace the 45,000 women given PIP implants as there was no register, 
many of the companies who used them had gone out of business and a lot 
of the women didn’t even know which implants they’d been given).

There
are currently nearly 200 fillers available in the UK, yet only 14 are 
licensed for use in the US, so from now on, fillers will also have to 
pass vigorous safety appraisals, be prescription only and only those 
with appropriate skills can administer them.

Other
recommendations include a register of qualified and assessed surgeons 
who practice in the UK to prevent fly in fly out doctors and, very 
importantly an independent ombudsman for women to go to when something 
does go wrong.

So
after everything I’ve learned during my eight months on the review 
committee, would I have cosmetic surgery? Having been under the knife 
for two back operations, I would never want to subject my body to a 
surgical procedure if it wasn’t absolutely necessary.

But Botox? I wouldn’t be averse to a shot or two of that. I’ll definitely be doing my research beforehand though.
