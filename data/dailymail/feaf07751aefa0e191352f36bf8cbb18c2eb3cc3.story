An archer has achieved an impressive feat of marksmanship after splitting one arrow with another.

South Korean Joo Hyun-jung performed the shot, known among archers as a 'Robin Hood' in a practice session for the Archery World Cup in Medellin, Colombia yesterday.

The Robin Hood shot refers to shooting one arrow into another one.

The impressive shot is akin to that of a golfer managing to get two holes in one on the same round of golf.

The iconic archery shot has been re-produced in various Robin Hood films over the years - archer Howard Hill reportedly managed to split a target-embedded arrow with his own while he was working as a stunt archer for the The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) which starred Errol Flynn.

But when it was carried out in the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, starring Kevin Costner, it was the use of special effects which saw the camera seemingly follow the arrow through the air.

In 2008 a British blind grandmother pulled off the shot at a practice session of the Wellington Bowmen in Somerset.

Tilly Trotter, 74, told The Daily Telegraph: 'The second arrow made such a noise going into the back of previous arrow I thought I had hit the ceiling or done some expensive damage.

'Then I heard people jumping up and down shouting that I'd done a Robin Hood.

'It was a one-in-a-million shot and a bit of a fluke really.'

Peter Jones, a spokesman for the Grand National Archery Society, said: 'It's a very rare feat - like getting two holes in one on the same round of golf.'
