A motorcyclist was caught performing stunts and travelling at 120mph when he was spotted by a hi-tech patrol plane with a powerful new camera 2,000ft in the air.

Corey McDonah, 23, appeared in a Hayward court last week after authorities in a California Highway Patrol aircraft spotted him driving at nearly double the speed limit on April 2.

CHP Officer Tony Jackson shot a video of McDonah from more than a mile away after spotting him during a routine patrol over the East Bay.

A patrol plane spotted Corey McDonah driving on his motorbike at speeds of up to 120mph last month

He can be seen pulling a wheelie and at one point stands on his seat, KTVU.com reported.

The plane followed McDonah to his home several miles away in San Leandro where he was arrested, CBS San Francisco has reported.

McDonah pleaded no contest to reckless driving and was sentenced to three years of probation, 20 days with the sheriff's work squad, and 40 hours of community service.

He must also pay a $500 fine and take a safety class or sell his motorcycle.

According to myfoxphilly.com,
 Tim Wellman, Alameda County Deputy District Attorney, said: 'It was so 
reckless, it was so dangerous, that not only did he put his own life in 
danger, he put the lives of innocent drivers on the freeway in danger as
 well.'

The Air-37 patrol 
plane, complete with a thermal camera and lens which has the ability to zoom 
in from a range of several miles, flies at any time during the day.

While at 2,000ft in the air it may just appear a dot in the sky, the cameras on board are so powerful they are able to record objects on the ground in fine detail.

Last month, MailOnline reported how a reckless biker had been banned from the roads after filming himself speeding, jumping red lights and pulling wheelies on his high-powered bike.

Lewis Shallcross, 20, used his helmet-mounted camera to take footage of himself - and was later spotted by officers roaring through quiet streets at 60mph after dark with no headlights.

Shallcross - who told police officers he thought the speed limit was 100mph - had his camera seized, and evidence of him roaring through Plymouth, Devon was used as evidence against him in court.
