Gaffe: Broadcaster John Inverdale, pictured, excused his foul language as a 'slip of the tongue'

BBC presenter John Inverdale was forced to apologise after swearing during radio coverage of the Cheltenham Festival.

Speaking on BBC 5 Live, the veteran broadcaster accidentally said 'rose-c***ed' glasses when reflecting on the career of former jockey John Francome.

He quickly corrected himself and apologised before explaining it had been a 'slip of the tongue'.

Inverdale made the embarrassing gaffe while interviewing Francome and rising racing star Lizzie Kelly earlier today.

Francome, who became a racing pundit after retiring from the sport, said: 'You get wet, you're mucking out, and it's hard work.

'But through all of that it's a way of life that most of them wouldn't swap, a lot of people go off and do other things and then come back to it.' 

To which Inverdale replied: 'This is looking at it through rose-c***ed, rose-tinted glasses from the past... I apologise there for a slip of the tongue, but Lizzie your love of the sport just shines through.'

Kelly, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise in the last 12 months, struggled not to laugh as she said: Oh yeah, because, as I've said it's very important to love it or you wouldn't do it otherwise.'

It is not the first time that Inverdale's language has landed him in trouble.

He made headlines last year when he said 't**t' during an interview with former tennis World No. 1 tennis star Jim Courier during French Open coverage.

Speaking to Courier about Twitter, Inverdale said: 'Did you know the past participle of tweeting was t**t?'  He quickly corrected himself, saying: 'Was twit'.

And in 2013 the broadcaster faced public criticism when he said that Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli was 'never going to be a looker' during coverage of the tournament. 

Inverdale sparked a furore  when he made the comment about the appearance of the French player, who had just won the  ladies' final.

Speaking the following year, Inverdale said that he knew that he had committed a gaffe but that his BBC training meant that he did not say sorry. 

A BBC spokeswoman said: 'It was a slip of the tongue and John apologised immediately afterwards.'
