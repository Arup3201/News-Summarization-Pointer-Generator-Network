A travel agency manager who tricked Take That fans into paying for tickets to a sold out Wembley gig that never existed has been jailed.

Symon Webb, 46, made £65,000 from customers he tricked into paying for concerts and holidays at his travel agency and then failed to deliver.

Take That fans only found out when their coach to Wembley didn't arrive that they had been ripped off.

The conman, who traded as Lowestoft Travel from June 2009, was jailed for 16 months yesterday and banned from being a director for seven years after admitting fraudulent trading.

The director pocketed £36,109 alone from Take That fans for gig tickets, Norwich Crown Court heard.

David Wilson, prosecuting, said: 'The concerts went ahead, but for the customers due to travel via Lowestoft Travel they were to be disappointed.

'Many customers were left standing in vain for coaches which did not arrive.

'Had such tickets existed then of course irrespective of the absence of coach travel, the customers would still have had the concert tickets available to them.

'The absence of provision of such tickets indicates that no such tickets ever existed.'

The travel agency scam started to unravel after Webb and two drivers were arrested in Dover, Kent, on June 30, 2010, for drug smuggling.

Webb was jailed for four years in March 2011 for trying to import cannabis worth £68,000.

Mr Wilson said: 'His arrest appears to have been a trigger for further acts of a dishonest nature with Lowestoft Travel.'

Holidaymakers who had paid Webb to go to to Spain were due to leave on March 18, 2011.

But they found the hotel had not been booked and the cost of just the accommodation alone topped what they had been charged.

Mr Wilson said the trip would never have been viable.

On March 16, 2011, Lowestoft Travel stopped operating. Webb lied that customer deposits were protected, said Mr Wilson.

'Had a bond in reality existed then customers would have had the opportunity of refunds on purchases for trips and excursions they had paid for,' he said.

Jailed: Webb, 46, was locked up for 16 months by a judge at Norwich Crown Court

Judge Coleman told Webb, of Slough, Berkshire, yesterday: 'It was a series of dishonest acts and it took place over a long period of time and there was a significant loss in excess of £60,000.

'All those disappointed people must even now be cursing under their breath for what you did. One can forgive them that feeling.'

Claire Davies, defending, said that he had ran a successful business but as he got into debt he struggled to keep going.

She said: 'He would wish to compensate people but at the moment he cannot do so.'

Ashley and Gloria Lake, of Lowestoft, Suffolk, paid £758 to go on a holiday to Spain's Costa Brava with the crooked travel agent in September 2011, but it never happened.

Mr Lake, 67, said: 'I was so angry. He just took our money and was going to rip us off for the very beginning.'

He added after Webb was jailed: 'That has made me feel really good. He should have known what would happen when he took our money.'
