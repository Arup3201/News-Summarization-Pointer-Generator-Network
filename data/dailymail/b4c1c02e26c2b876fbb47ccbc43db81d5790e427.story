Real Madrid are in discussions over a deal for Manchester United's young right-back Guillermo Varela.

The 21-year-old was David Moyes's first official signing from Penarol for £1.75m but Madrid want him to join up with Zinedine Zidane and their B team Castilla. 

Manchester United are expected to announce their deal for Angel Di Maria imminently but it now appears that may not be the end of the two clubs' transfer dealings.

Real have asked for a loan for the right-back which could then become a permanent £4m deal. 

Varela is capped at youth level for Uruguay, having played for both their Under 17 side and also the Under 20 side.

The former Penarol man has failed to make a single appearance for Manchester United's first team but has been used regularly for the club's Under 21 team.
