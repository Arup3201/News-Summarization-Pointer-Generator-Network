Dick Cheney's daughter Liz Cheney, who is currently running as a Republican candidate for Senate in Wyoming, reaffirmed her disapproval of gay marriage today despite having a legally-married lesbian sister.

In an interview with Fox News Sunday, Chris Wallace asked Cheney if she was flip-flopping on her gay marriage stance.

He pointed out that she opposed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage while also supporting the State Department's plan to offer benefits to same-sex employees and their partners.

'It's not, and I stand by both of those positions,' Cheney said. 'I don't believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. If people are in a same-sex relationship and they want their partner to be able to have health benefits or be designated as a beneficiary in your life insurance, there's no reason we shouldn't do that.

'I also don't support amending the Constitution on this issue. I do believe it's an issue that's got to be left up to the states. I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage,' Cheney added.

In September her sister Mary Cheney, who legally married her longtime partner Heather Poe in Washington last year, wrote on Facebook saying her sister's stance on gay marriage was 'dead wrong'.

'For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage. Freedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all families - regardless of how they look or how they are made - all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other.'

Liz Cheney responded to that message on Sunday, saying that she too loves her sister but this is an issue 'on which we disagree'.

Cheney's strong-stance on the issue of gay marriage may have to do with her fight to win the senate race in ultra-conservative Wyoming.

‘I am not pro-gay marriage,’ Cheney previously said in a statement released by her campaign.

Cheney announced her run for senate against incumbent Republican Senator Mike Enzi last month.

‘I believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states,’ the statement continued, ‘and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.’

Push back? Liz Cheney claims her opponent Mike Enzi is conducting a push poll campaign that asks voters 'Are you aware that Liz Cheney supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage?'

This stance is also a slight departure for the candidate in regards to her high profile family.

Since as far back as 2004, Dick Cheney has maintained a pro-gay marriage stance.

‘Lynne and I have a gay daughter, so it’s an issue our family is very familiar with,’ Cheney told an audience that included his daughter while stumping in Iowa in 2004.

‘With the respect to the question of relationships, my general view is freedom means freedom for everyone. People ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to.’
