Sitting happily in the saddle, nine-year-old Daisy Pritchard looks a picture of poise.

But the confident young rider has far more to thank her pony for than a bracing trot in the winter sunshine.

After she suffered a stroke during a heart operation at 21 months, doctors warned Daisy would never walk or talk again.

Daisy has built a remarkable bond with Dollar, pictured, and is making a good recovery after being told she would never walk or talk again 

Yet thanks to the remarkable bond she has forged with Dollar the pony, she is making an extraordinary recovery.

It began when Dollar, who belongs to her mother, sauntered over to the little girl, who was in her wheelchair on a trip to the stables when she was nearly three.

Daisy’s mother Eileen, 44, said: ‘There was a flicker of recognition between the two of them. Then Daisy turned her head towards his and Dollar put his ears back as if to say, “I’m here”. 

'It was the first time since the stroke Daisy had moved her head and in that moment I saw a spark of the child I’d lost.’

After eight months Mrs Pritchard began holding Daisy up on Dollar’s saddle as she’d sometimes done on visits to the stable before she became ill.

Daisy had been undergoing physiotherapy for her back, which was twisted after the stroke left her right side paralysed.

She disliked the repetitive exercises, but riding 24-year-old Dollar – holding the reins with her left hand – proved to be the perfect therapy. 

By the age of five, her back muscles were strong enough to allow her to walk short distances.

Daisy's mother Eileen took her daughter when she was still in her wheelchair to the stables with her and that's when she struck up a bond with the horse 

Mrs Pritchard, from Wrexham, Wales, gave birth to Daisy in 2006 after she and husband David, a company director, had several rounds of IVF. 

She has four older children from a previous relationship. Tests in 2008 revealed Daisy had only three heart chambers instead of the normal four and needed an operation to reposition her arteries. 

The first surgery went wrong and she was rushed back for a second operation, during which she had the stroke.

Her mother said: ‘When Daisy had gone into theatre she’d been a beautiful, blonde, chatty toddler who was running around. Now she was just lying there helpless.’

Since learning to ride, Daisy has come on in leaps and bounds – walking, talking and attending mainstream school – although she still uses a scooter or wheelchair to help her get around outside the house.

She can ride without any assistance and has even developed a special way of communicating with Dollar, tapping either side of his neck to ask him to turn. 

Mrs Pritchard, who is now separated from her husband, said: ‘Without Dollar in her life I don’t believe Daisy would have ever recovered. He became her legs, her reason to get up and walk.

‘It might sound strange to say about a horse, but I will always be so grateful to Dollar ... I thought I’d lost my beautiful daughter but his healing has brought her back.

‘With other people Dollar can be quite boisterous. But when Daisy is riding him he purposely takes smaller steps. He is devoted, ensuring she’s steady on him.

‘When Daisy rides Dollar onlookers have no idea at all she is paralysed down her right side, unable to use her right arm and leg.’

Daisy and Dollar have developed a special way of communicating with Daisy tapping Dollar either side of his neck to turn.

Although Daisy still has to use a scooter or wheelchair for walking outside the house, on Dollar she is so stable she can ride herself.

Mrs Pritchard said: ‘These days Daisy and I go riding together, with her on Dollar. It might sound strange to say about a horse, but I will always be so grateful to Dollar.

‘For a long time I thought I’d lost my beautiful daughter but his healing has brought her back.’
