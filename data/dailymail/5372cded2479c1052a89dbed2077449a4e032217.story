Oil chiefs told offshore workers to put on their 'big-boy pants' or quit if they couldn’t deal with the risk of helicopter crashes - just weeks before the Shetland chopper disaster last week which killed four.

Bosses at Total oil company told stunned crew not to complain about the prospect of crashing at sea during risky flights on the same oil rig that the doomed helicopter left last Friday.

The talk, which took place on August 8, involved helicopter company CHC’s chief pilot Will Hanekom, and Total head of logistics Christophe Barbier, according to the Press and Journal in north east Scotland.

Investigation: The wreckage of the Super Puma L2 helicopter which went down in the North Sea with the loss of four lives around two miles west of Sumburgh Airport on Shetland

It was meant to reassure workers concerned about the safety of Super Puma choppers.

But in a leaked audio recording from the meeting on the Borgsten Dolphin Rig one worker asked what Total would do if they refused to board a chopper because they feared for their life.

One boss replied: 'If you can’t live with that risk then you can’t work offshore.'

A CHC pilot added: 'I have to say how else are we going to get there? It is what we do.

Response: The wreckage floats on the surface as the operation to recover the helicopter and the last of the four bodies was completed today

Loss of power: The helicopter was being operated by CHC for oil company Total and was transporting workers from the Borgsten Dolphin platform

Difficult task: RNLI volunteers and Coastguard workers inspecting the wreckage of the Super Puma L2 helicopter which went down in the North Sea with the loss of four lives

'At some point we have to put our big-boy pants on and say either "we believe", either what I am telling you is the truth and I’m willing to sit in the front and risk my family and everything that I have got.

'If you don’t, well, I wouldn’t force any of my pilots to fly if they didn’t want to.'

Today local trade union boss Jake Molloy criticised the oil and helicopter bosses.

The RMT Regional Organiser said: 'It’s an appalling statement to make to anybody at anytime, whether it was before or after Friday’s incident.

'If anybody has any concerns about flying on helicopters, they should be given support if required.'For representatives of an oil company and helicopter firm to say that is just plain out of order.

Model: An undated handout photograph released by CHC Helicopter shows a Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma L2 variant, the same model as the CHC operated helicopter that crashed in the North Sea

'It’s poor, poor management and they shouldn’t be in a job if that’s their attitude towards their workforce.'

The talk was meant to reassure workers about the Super Puma EC225 fleets, which had just returned to service after being grounded following safety fears when two were forced to make an emergency bail-out at sea last year.

But Total and CHC stand by what was said in the safety briefing and claim they were trying to prove the safety of the EC225, not the older AS332 L2 model that crashed on Friday evening off the coast of the Scottish island.

Inverness

Tragedy: George Allison, 57, from Winchester, and Sarah Darnley, 45, 
from Elgin, who lost their lives

The crash claimed the lives of Sarah Darnley, 45, of Elgin, Gary McCrossan, 59, of Inverness, Duncan Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland, and 57-year-old George Alison from Winchester.

A Total spokesman said: 'We’re talking about a different model of helicopter and we don’t yet know what caused this tragic accident on Friday.'
