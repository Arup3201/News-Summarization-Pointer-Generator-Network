A teenager who apparently never swore couldn't stop cursing after getting his wisdom teeth pulled.

American YouTube user mlprice31 filmed her son Cameron shouting out a range of expletives after undergoing the procedure.

'N**ga I'm hungry,' he slurs on the car journey home, adding that he wants a meal from Jack in the Box despite being unable to eat with a swollen mouth.

Changed person: YouTube user mlprice31 filmed her son Cameron shouting out a range of expletives after undergoing a wisdom tooth extraction 

'Cameron, can you stop cussing?' his mother tells him.

She then asks him if he's alright as he incessantly mumbles away with his eyes closed.

He reassures her that he feels 'good' and it's just that the laughing gas has made him high. 

Cameron's bad behavior continues as he proceeds to unbuckle his seat belt.

He also threatens to take his shirt off because he's feeling hot.

Finally after the stressful  journey, the car pulls up in the driveway at home. 

Welcome home: The teen is greeted by his grandmother, who is unsure what to make of his dazed state

Not with it: He is later seen lay slumped on the couch, mumbling and waving his arms in the air

The teen is greeted by his grandmother, who is unsure what to make of his dazed state.

It takes several minutes to persuade Cameron to get out of the car.

Some wisdom teeth extractions are performed with local anesthesia, numbing the area from where the tooth is removed.

Alternatively, patients are given oral medication, such as Valium or Ativan, before the procedure and require an escort home while the effects wear off.

Another option is intravenous sedation, administered through IV. 

Although a patient is conscious throughout they are usually completely unaware of the procedure. 

An escort home is vital while the sedation wears off.

When he does get out of the vehicle, he can barely stand up straight.

His grandmother tries to help him walk by holding him around the stomach. 

She is seen smiling at the camera as she struggles to offer support.

When Cameron eventually makes it to the front door of his home, he doesn't seem to know where he is.

'I ain't going into that motherf***ing place. You n**ga's crazy . . . What you all doing to me?' he cries out. 

With a bit of persuasion he is corralled inside the house and the video cuts to to show him lay slumped on the couch, mumbling and waving his arms in the air.

Cameron's mother said that she found the incident 'hilarious.'

She added: 'Although he's 18, I had NEVER heard my son say a swear nor say the ''N'' word in my presence until this day.

'And boy did he bring it all out!'
