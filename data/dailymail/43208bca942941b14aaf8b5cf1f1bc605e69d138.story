When Jody Kinsey of Miles City was told last summer she was pregnant with triplets, everyone in the family was surprised - except for her husband, Jase.

'My dad's a multiple,' the 29-year-old father told the Billings Gazette after the three boys were born. 'I just kind of had that feeling that it would get me sooner or later.'

Since Jody, 30, wasn't undergoing fertility treatment, the odds of that actually happening were, in the words of Dr Dana Damron, one in a million.

Special delivery: Jody Kinsey of Miles City, Montana, gave birth to identical triplets, which are an extremely rare case for women not undergoing fertility treatment

'To have a patient with spontaneous identical triplets is incredibly rare,' said Dr Damon, a maternal fetal medicine physician at the Billings Clinic where the triplets were delivered.

KULR reports that the first one to be born, Cade, is already out of the intensive care unit, and will soon be joined by his brothers Ian and Milo.

The triplets were born early in December, at 32 weeks, nothing out of the ordinary for triplets in the United States, according to Billings Clinic registered nurse Tiffany Draayer.

'You take care of their oxygenation, make sure they're breathing well,' said Draayer. 'All three of them did really well, and they just have to work on eating.'

'Once they can all eat, and don't have to be tube-fed for their feedings for a few days, then they get to go home,' she added.

Dr Damron said that considering the difficulty in delivering triplets, the pregnancy went as smoothly as possible.

Happy and healthy: Ian, Milo and Cade are healthy, according to clinic officials, who say they'll be ready to go home once they can eat on their own

Intensive care: The triplets were kept in intensive care due to being born premature at 32 weeks, though medical staff say this is normal for triplets

Comedy of errors: The triplets' father, Jase, is already envisioning his three sons causing hijinks as identical siblings 

'When you see a patient with triplets, you take a deep breath and realize all sorts of complications that can occur,' he said. 'But when it turns out well in the end, it’s one of the most amazing experiences.'

Their father is already planning for the triplets to get into the habit of slapstick hijinks when they're older.

'They can scheme together and get it figured out to where, "Okay you're better at math, so you go to my math class, and you go to my math class, and I'll go to English, 'cause I'm better at English,' said Jase.

Jody was only focused on bringing them back home to join their six-year-old brother Jax. 

'It'll be nice to get them all home, and get a routine figured out,' she said.
