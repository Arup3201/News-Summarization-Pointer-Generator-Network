The battle for Rangers took another twist on Sunday night when it emerged that American financier Robert Sarver had submitted an £18million offer for a controlling stake.

Sarver, who owns the Phoenix Suns basketball team, made his offer to PLC chairman David Somers in the days after Christmas.

He wanted a general meeting called to approve the issue of new shares and was willing to spend a further £15m to buy up 100 per cent of the club.

However, the acquisitions made recently by Dave King and a consortium comprising Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor – who now have around 34 per cent between them - have since altered the picture significantly. None of those wealthy fans would have any intention of selling as they seek to force regime change.

While the initial format of his bid appears unlikely to succeed, Sarver may still have a role to play as it is understood he would be willing to work alongside fan groups and Rangers-supporting businessmen.

The 52-year-old chief executive of Western Alliance Bancorporation is thought to have had some limited contact with the Park consortium. Should the broad coalition of fans succeed in toppling the current board, then he could figure in plans to try and rebuild the financially-stricken club.

‘Sarver is a serious player with superb credentials,’ one source told BBC Scotland.

‘He knows what it takes to make major sports clubs successful and would bring a tremendous track record to Rangers.

‘He is regarded as a straight-talking and very determined guy with a genuine passion for sport and an impressive record of success at the highest level of US sport and business.

‘Of course, he sees this as an exciting opportunity to invest in a major sporting institution, but given his involvement in the NBA, he fully realises that, without the broad support of fans, any proposals are doomed to failure.’

At least 75 per cent of shareholders would have to agree to new shares being issued to a non-shareholder at a general meeting, after resolution nine was defeated at club’s AGM in December.

As it stands, existing shareholders must be given first refusal on the available new shares, which could raise around £6.5m. The acquisitions made by King and the Park group give them a strong hand – and they could apply to buy up any shares not taken up when the issue goes ahead.
