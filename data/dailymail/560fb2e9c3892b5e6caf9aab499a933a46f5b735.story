David Cameron has been pictured smiling for the cameras alongside Morris dancers with blacked-up faces.

The Prime Minister happily posed for photographers with his daughter Florence at the Banbury Folk Festival.

The picture is likely to prove controversial, with the tradition of having blacked-up faces branded racist in the past.

Mr Cameron and his family attended the annual event on Saturday.

Martin de Vine, founder and Squire of the Foxs Morris dancers, said it had been a 'wonderful weekend of dancing'.

Writing on the Fox Morris Facebook page, he said: 'Lovely dance spots with welcome refreshments provided. And a great concert on Friday.

'Some bloke who lives in Downing Street joined us on Saturday, and Chris Leslie (Fairport Convention) stopped for a few words on Sunday.'

Referring to Mr Cameron's appearance at the event, Mr de Vine added: 'His politics are not my politics but happy for Banbury Folk Festival to gain some publicity to ensure its future...although it might have the opposite effect!'

The group insists the tradition is not racist. They stress that it stretches back five centuries and refers to when unemployed farm labourers would cover their faces in soot while begging for money to avoid being recognised.

Mr de Vine told the Telegraph: 'It's not racist and offence is never taken. People from other cultural backgrounds don't see it as that at all. We have had an Arab person dancing with us in the past - it's not seen as racist.' 

The Foxs Morris was started in 1999 and is based at Cookley School in Worcestershire, where Mr De Vine is headteacher. 

A Downing Street source reiterated the explanation from the group about the origins of the blacking-up tradition. 'The organisation itself says it's nothing to do with racism,' the source added. 

Earlier this year an ale featuring Morris dancers with blacked-up faces was rejected by a bar in the Houses of Parliament because the pump badge was deemed to be offensive.

Tory MP Jake Berry had nominated a beer from the Irwell Works Brewery intended to celebrate the Britannia Coconut Dancers from nearby Bacup, who have been performing since 1857 with blacked faces to celebrate the area's mining heritage.

But a spokesman for the House of Commons said: 'The ale offered was not acceptable as the imagery proposed to be used in connection with sales may have caused offence.' 

Heritage: A 'Nutter',  part of the history of the small Pennine town of Bacup

The Foxs Morris group insists the tradition is not racist.

They say they are reviving a tradition associated with Border Morris dancing, in which Welsh Morris dancers on the English border used fire-blackened cork to disguise themselves when they went begging in the streets more than five centuries ago.

When money was scarce in the winter months they would dance but have to disguise themselves. It was necessary to use a disguise to avoid arrest for begging.

Each dancer also makes his or her own tattercoat which is made from rags. This reflects the origins of border morris dancing in poor rural communities who had to make good use of every resource

The Britannia Coconut Dancers, known as the 'Nutters', are part of the history of the small Pennine town of Bacup.

Every Easter Saturday the troupe of men - dressed in red and white kilts and clogs, with their faces blackened - take to the streets of the town to dance their way from one side to the other.

They perform folk dances, which are said to have originated with Moorish pirates.

The custom of blackened faces, reflects, according to their website, a 'pagan or medieval background' to 'disguise the dancers from being recognised by evil spirits'.

It is also thought to link to the town's mining heritage.

In April Will Straw, son of the former Labour Cabinet minister Jack, defended posting a photograph on Twitter celebrating an Easter tradition with Morris dancers with blacked-up faces - claiming his critics were ignorant about history.

Mr Straw, who has been selected by Labour to fight one of the party's top target seats at next year's general election, uploaded the tweet after meeting The Britannia Coconutters on Saturday.

The 32-year-old responded to the outcry - some have branded the tradition 'racist' - defending the historic performances as a vital piece of local cultural history.
