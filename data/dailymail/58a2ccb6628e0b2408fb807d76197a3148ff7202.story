Maxwell Morton, 16, of Jeannette has since been arrested and charged with criminal homicide, first-degree murder and possession of a firearm by a minor.

He was identified as the shooter after he took a selfie with Mangan's body on Snapchat and sent the image to a friend, according to police.

The image showed Mangan in the same position and condition that authorities found him, with a single gunshot wound to the face, in his mother's home last Wednesday evening.

Morton's friend saved the image before it deleted itself, as SnapChat lets users send images that are removed from the recipient's phone after a few seconds.

Both of the boys attended Jeannette High School. Police are continuing to look for a motive in the case

The friend's mother, who first alerted police about the picture from Morton, also said her son received messages from him that said: 'I told you I cleaned up the shells' and 'Ryan was not the last one'. 

Following a search at Morton's home, he confessed to shooting Mangan after police found a 9mm handgun hidden under the basement steps that matched the shell casing found at the scene of the murder, according to Triblive.

In the ongoing investigation, Morton's phone will be examined for any other evidence and police are continuing to look for a motive in the shooting. 

The Jeannette School District delayed classes by two hours because of the funeral (above Sacred Heart Church), and said grief counselors will be available during the next few days

A GoFundMe page was created to help contribute to Mangan's burial cost and nearly $6,000 were raised in donations. In four days, 169 people contributed $5,925 to the funeral fund. 

A post written on the page said that Mangan leaves behind devastated parents, a brother, niece, extended relatives and many friends.

The Jeannette School District delayed classes by two hours because of the funeral, and said grief counselors will be available during the next few days, according to the Post-Gazette.

Both boys were students at Jeannette High School.

Morton is being held in a juvenile detention center without bail and is set to face a preliminary hearing on February 19.
