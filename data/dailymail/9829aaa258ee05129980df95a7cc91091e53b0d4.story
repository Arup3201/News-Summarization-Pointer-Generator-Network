Men everywhere will likely be taking aim at director of the upcoming Fifty Shades of Grey film Sam Taylor-Wood, when they discover that she turned down one of the desired glamour models around for the role of Anastasia in the steamy adaptation.

After a modelling career spanning eight years and almost as many covers Keeley Hazell is back for this month’s FHM magazine, and opening up about her raunchy role ambitions.

The 27-year-old, who relocated to LA to focus her energies on an acting and writing career  revealed: 'I auditioned twice for Fifty Shades Of Grey – that was a pretty, erm, “interesting” experience.'

'The truth is that women want to be viewed as sexy. Shooting a cover like this is so empowering' says Keeley

However Keeley confesses that she was not as devastated as on might imagine at losing out to Dakota Mayi Johnson for the movie role, as her real interest lies elsewhere.

'I’ve done some acting stuff – a couple of films and other projects. But the thing I’ve been most passionate about is my writing,' she confesses.

'I’m currently collaborating with a talented young female director – we wrote a series that has been taken on by a production company. It’s in the super-early stages, but it’s really exciting.

'In a nutshell it’s about a girl from London, who moves to LA and attempts to reinvent herself as the creator of a fashion-focused lifestyle website. It’s loosely based on my life, but it’s also heavily influenced by internet celebrities, fashion bloggers and some “it” girls,' Keely gushes.

This career change has left many of her fans disappointed as Keeley has largely left her successful glamour modelling days behind her.

In the sexy shoot it is easy to see why she might be missed by adoring men.

With a pair of blue jeans and wedged sandals enhancing her impossibly long legs and wearing a black satin pushup bra to boost her cleavage, Keeley certainly hasn't forgotten how to raise pulses in her modelling hiatus.

Defending her return to men’s magazines after a 13-month long break Keeley says: 'I suppose I came to a realisation that being a serious actress and being on the cover of FHM don’t need to be mutually exclusive.

'There’s this perception that you can’t be more than one thing. That if you’re dubbed ‘sexy’ you can no longer be anything else. That you become intellectually uncomplicated, incapable of accomplishing anything other than appearing to be an object for men. And it’s rubbish.

'Society tells you that you can’t be smart and sexy, and that’s totally wrong.'

The fiesty model continues: 'The thing about sexiness is that it’s been painted as evil.

'But the truth is that women want to be viewed as sexy. Shooting a cover like this is so empowering. It brings out a different side of you, which is incredibly liberating.'This month’s FHM Magazine is on sale now (Thursday). Visit www.fhm.com for more of Keeley.
