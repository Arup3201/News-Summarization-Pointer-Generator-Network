A German architect has been given a one-year jail term after a Los Angeles firefighter was killed tackling a blaze in his modified Hollywood Hills home.

Gerhard Albert Becker, 49, is expected to serve four months of his prison sentence before being deported to Germany, after he pleaded no contest to involuntary manslaughter.

Firefighter Glenn Allen, 61, died after being trapped under several hundred pounds of plaster when a ceiling collapsed in Becker's home during a blaze in 2011.

Becker was accused of ignoring safety recommendations when he remodeled the $11 million home after it had already had safety inspections.

The verdict in the case was met with disappointment by Mr Allen's family and colleagues, who say the sentence sent the wrong message to contractors.

The fire was started by a fireplace Becker had installed in the building despite it being for outside use only, the court heard.

Budget cuts in Los Angeles also meant that the nearest fire house to the property, due to be used in the filming of Germany's Next Top Model, had been closed.

'It was a perfect storm, with the budget cuts and an architect who cut corners, and ultimately one of our firefighters paid the price,' Frank Lima, president of a United Firefighters of Los Angeles association, told the New York Times.

The fire was so intense that it melted the sprinkler system on the roof, causing water to build up and then cause the ceiling to collapse.

During the court case a firefighter recalled hearing a bang followed by an 'eerie silence' as the ceiling came down on him, NBC 4 reported.

Eleven other firefighters were injured when the plaster came down, and some still suffer with emotional and physical injuries.

'Some still have some traumatic effects, memory loss, ongoing neck pain; some have nightmares. This is going to be an ongoing thing for all of us,' fire captain Kevin Mulvehill said.

The courtroom also heard an impact statement from Mr Allen's widow, Melanie, who said her life had been 'ripped to shreds' by her 61-year-old husband's death.

'We had such plans for retirement, which
 was so close. I know it is cliche but we looked 
forward to growing old together,' her statement said.

Firefighters had to use chainsaws to free Mr Allen, who died in hospital five days after the fire.

Becker was sentenced to a year in county jail and must serve three years' probation, according to KTLA.

Los Angeles Fire Department reacted to the verdict in a statement that read: 'Todayâ€™s guilty verdict in the case of 
Gerhard Becker, should send a clear message and warning to those who try
 to circumvent those codes'
