Valencia have expressed an interest in Everton striker Samuel Eto'o.

The 33-year-old has impressed at Goodison this season and is popular among his team-mates and fans. 

He has been used mainly from the bench and has helped bring on Everton's younger players.

However, Valencia want him to bolster their attack and Singapore-base owner Peter Lim is happy to offer £75,000 per week in wages.

They hope that will persuade the Cameroon international to return to Spain where he performed so well for Real Mallorca and Barcelona.
