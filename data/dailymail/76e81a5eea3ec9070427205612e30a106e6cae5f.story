Plus-sized Australian women are turning to online shopping in order to avoid confrontation and ridicule from sales staff when asking for sizes above 12.

In a social experiment conducted by A Current Affair, Rebecca Turner - a size 16 - revealed that in the none of the nine stores she visited were able to offer her the same selection of clothing marketed to smaller women.

More often than not, staff would either ignore Ms Turner or simply turn her away from their store.

Ms Turner said the whole shopping experience is disheartening for her.

'I'm ignored and I have people looking me up and down,' she said.

In one instance, Ms Turner tried to stay in the vicinity of a shop assistant to see whether she would be approached.

'I purposely went towards her and she turned her head and found a different person â€“ a smaller person to go and help in the shop,' Ms Turner said.

Another case showed a staff member trying to convince Ms Turner to buy an item that was too small for her, saying 'it will stretch'.

Size 22 Lisa Manu, who recently lost 50kg, has had similar experiences.

'I literally dread going to the shops,' she said, referring to one particular incident that left her red-faced.

'As I walked in the two young girls were leaning on the counter said: "as if we've got anything in here for her",' Ms Manu said.

It's for this very reason she now chooses to do her clothes shopping online and she's clearly not alone.

A Current Affair reported that the average Australian woman is a size 14 with research showing that a third of plus size women are buying online - a warning for retailers to keep up with the demands or risk losing business.

Ms Turner simply wants to have the same shopping experience as any other Australian woman.

'I don't want to be hiding under a sack, I actually want to show off my curves and my healthy body,' she said.

'If you haven't got that life experience to shrug it off and you are a little bit vulnerable or younger, it can be really detrimental to your whole body image and your whole outlook on life'

Founder of Fame and Partners, Nyree Corby, saw a demand for a plus size range which prompted her to launch a new sizeable line of formal wear.

'Women in general deserve better,' Ms Corby said.

'They deserve to feel empowered and beauty after a shopping experience and that goes for a size 4 girl all the way to a size 26 girl,' she said.
