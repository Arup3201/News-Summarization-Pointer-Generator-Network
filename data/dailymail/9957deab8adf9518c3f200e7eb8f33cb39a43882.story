Thousands of British expats are suspected of committing benefit fraud abroad in the past year, costing Britain more than £80m - with Spain, Pakistan and Turkey the top destinations.

An astonishing new league table reveals 7,296 British nationals were accused of fiddling their benefits in the past year in 157 countries and regions worldwide.

The most common cases involved bogus 
claims for pension credit, which was around £52million, housing benefit 
- £19million - and income support, which was more than £10million.

Britons living abroad cheated the taxpayer out of more than £80m last year in false benefit claims. Karen Trant, 51, from Dartmouth, Devon,

years while living in Goa, India

Top destinations for fraud abroad were Spain, Pakistan and Turkey where more than 1,500 cases were reported in 2013-14.

The figures from the Department of Work and Pensions show 628 cases of benefit fraud reported in Pakistan, 298 in Turkey, 282 in India and 246 in the USA.

But the list of suspected fraudsters included such far-flung destinations as Madagascar, which had two cases, Oman, Jamaica, Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean and even the Vatican – where one person who was claiming a disability benefit was found on an Italian walking holiday.

Most popular on the list was Spain, home to around a million Britons, where 769 cases were investigated over the past year, including a couple who illegally received £140,000. 

William Bunce, 54, and Berwyn Jones, 50, of Pontypool in Wales who lived in the UK, said they didn’t have partners and were unfit for work.

They spent the money living a life of luxury in Spain. Earlier this year they were both sentenced to pay back the full amount and sentenced to four months in prison at Newport Crown Court.

Another high-claimer was Karen Trant, who claimed to be crippled by a fear of open spaces which left her housebound.

But she was snared by investigators are they found photographs of her enjoying beach holidays in Goa.

10) Cyprus - 126

The 51-year-old, who claimed £134,000 of taxpayers’ money over 13 years, bought a holiday home in the sunny Indian resort, and spent thousands of pounds on cosmetic surgery.

She was pictured sunning herself on an empty beach and riding a horse, having invested in a tummy tuck, liposuction and work on her ‘bingo wings’.

Miss Trant, from Dartmouth in Devon, was jailed last month for 27 months at Plymouth Crown Court after admitting unlawfully obtaining benefits.

The most common reasons were people failing to inform the Department of Work and Pensions they were living abroad, or not reporting the death of someone entitled to receive benefits.

On top of any fine or prison sentence handed out by the courts, the government is able to withhold up to 40pc of the person’s benefits in order to get the fraudulently claimed money back.

Welfare minister Mark Harper said: ‘We’re clamping down on fraud – both at home and abroad – so money goes to those who need it most, rather than lining the pockets of criminals sunning themselves overseas.

‘We’re toughening up the system and working more closely with foreign authorities so we can bring benefit cheats to court and make sure they’re appropriately punished. More fraudsters are realising there are no hiding places when you break the law.’

Richard West, head of the DWP’s counter-fraud teams, said: ‘Cases range from people hiding foreign assets and homes to those moving abroad, either temporarily or permanently, at the taxpayers’ expense.

‘Benefit cheats need to know that even if they are out of the country, our teams will still investigate and, where necessary, bring them back to the UK to face justice.'
