The figure of speech 'a chip off the old block' appears to an apt one for Henrik Larsson's son, Jordan following his recent stunning strike.

The son of former Celtic, Barcelona and Manchester United striker Henrik scored a sublime solo effort for Norwegian side Helsingborg against Syrianska on Wednesday night.

Larsson Jnr's strike is certainly one that his dad, and the current manager of Helsingborg, would have been proud of as he opened the scoring in their 2-2 draw during the Swedish Cup encounter.

Running on the shoulder of the last defender, the 17-year-old gathers the ball on the edge of the box before turning and unleashing a beautifully curled effort that flies into the top corner.

According to some reports in Sweden after the goal, Helsingborg fans sang: 'He's better than his dad!'

And judging by that striker Larsson could well emulate his father's goalscoring talents that illuminated Europe for 25 years.

Larsson is probably best remembered for his seven-year spell at Celtic where his honours included four league titles and two Scottish Cups.

On Thursday the Scottish giants announced that they have signed a long-term deal with sports manufacturer New Balance - who will become their official kit supplier from the 2015/16 season onwards.

Celtic Chief Executive Peter Lawwell commented: 'New Balance is one of the world's leading sportswear manufacturers and will cater to the huge global demand for the Celtic FC kit. Importantly, our cultures match well.

'While New Balance is relatively new to football, its sporting heritage dates back more than 100 years and there is huge excitement around the brand and its ambitions globally. 

Our supporters are rightly proud of the similarly long and prestigious history of our Club, and both Celtic FC and New Balance look forward to an exciting, long and rewarding future collaboration.

'Once again we are pleased to connect with a brand of such quality and stature and we are sure our supporters will warmly welcome New Balance to the Celtic family.'
