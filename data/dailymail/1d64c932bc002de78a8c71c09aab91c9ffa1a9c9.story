The funeral of a five-year-old girl who died after being knocked down by a car days before Christmas has been postponed because her grandparents have been denied a visa. 

Andrea Gada was hit by a car in Eastbourne in East Sussex as she walked home from school with her father and stepped out into the road. 

But despite the efforts of locals to raise £5,000 to support her parents and pay for family members to fly over from Zimbabwe for the funeral, officials have now denied to grant a visa for the child's grandparents Charity and Wellington Gada.

The funeral of five-year-old Andrea Gada, who was killed in a road accident, has been postponed after her grandparents and aunt were denied a visa to travel to the UK from Zimbabwe to come and pay their respects 

Stephen Lloyd, MP for Eastbourne, has accused the Home Office of 'callousness.'  

Officials have also denied a visa to Andrea's aunt who wanted to come across to England to pay her final respects to the child.

Andrea was struck by a Ford Fusion in Friday Street at about 3.15pm on December 16 and was flown to St George's Hospital in Tooting in South London for treatment, but died of her injuries.

Her parents believe she may have stepped into the road because she was eager to get home and wrap Christmas presents for her friends.

The 64-year-old female driver from Eastbourne was not injured in the incident, Sussex Police said. 

Since her death locals in Eastbourne have supported the child's parents, both students, and raised money to help family members travel over for her funeral.

Mr Lloyd said: 'This awful accident has shocked us all.

'Eastbourne has done what it does best in difficult situations like this and rallied around in support as a community.

'I was dismayed therefore to discover that the Immigration Services have refused point blank to issue visas for the family to come over from Zimbabwe to attend little Andrea's funeral.

'This is despite Mr and Mrs Gada giving me a categorical assurance the grandparents and aunt would be returning home soon after paying their respects.

'I am extremely angry at the callousness shown by the Home Office.

'To me this is an immigration decision which lacks compassion and basic decency - attributes which I know are front and centre with the vast majority of British people.

'I have written a further urgent letter to the Immigration Minister, James Brokenshire MP, asking that he intervene and reconsider his officials' decision.

'A young girl has died tragically.

Mr Lloyd said he wanted to appeal to Mr Brokenshire to grant temporary travel visas to the family so they could pay their respects to the young girl.

Wellington and Charity Gada are from Zimbabwe and were granted asylum in the UK.

The Home Office told members of the family that the request had been denied because they were not satisfied they were sufficient family and economic ties for them in Zimbabwe.

Little Andrea's funeral was due to take place on Friday but has now been postponed because of the issues 

Andrea's parents said they believed their daughter had been rushing home to wrap Christmas presents 

Officials also said they were not satisified there were 'sufficient factors' that would ensure their departure from the UK, the BBC reported.

Andrea's funeral was due to take place on Friday but has now been postponed. 

A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'All applications are considered on their individual merits, including any compelling and compassionate circumstances, and in line with the immigration rules.'
