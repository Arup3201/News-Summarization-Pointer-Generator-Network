Natasha Calcraft, 29, has told how she tried to save her husband Luke's life after he suffered a severe allergic reaction to a bee sting

The wife of a British Mormon father-of-six killed by a severe reaction to a bee sting has paid tribute to her 'soulmate' and told of how she struggled in vain to save his life.

Luke Calcraft, 46, was rushed to hospital after being stung by a bee while cutting down trees in the garden of his family home in Pennsylvania, but died four days later.

Now his wife, 29-year-old Natasha, has recalled how she injected her husband with three EpiPens as he went into anaphylactic shock, and performed CPR until an ambulance arrived. 

The mother-of-two said: 'We were cutting down trees, trying to clear about an acre of land for a garden and at the very end of the day Luke lit a fire to burn all the branches we had chopped down and that is when he was stung.

'He ran over to me and said "I've been stung in the arm, can you see anything"?

'There was no immediate reaction - but then he got woozy and said "run and grab my EpiPens" so I grabbed all three of them and administered the first one and he went unconscious, I administered the second one but he was foaming at the mouth and was struggling to breathe.

'I ran to my neighbour, who is a nurse, and she gave him the third one but he went into anaphylactic shock which caused a cardiac arrest and he started turning purple.

'We tried doing CPR but his throat was so swollen that the air could not get through.'

Natasha revealed Luke's extreme allergy to bees and wasps only began affecting him after he moved to America from Chelmsford in late 2011.

A previous wasp sting whilst in The States left Luke unconscious for 12 hours on the floor of his bathroom, and a GP later confirmed he had a severe allergy.

Luke had been taking a series of venom injections in a bid to build up his immunity but they were not enough to help him.

He suffered a severe lack of oxygen for 30 minutes and by the time he had arrived at hospital he was already brain dead. As the days passed at St. Luke's Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Luke's condition deteriorated.

Natasha said she injected Luke with three EpiPens after he was stung cutting down trees in the garden of their family home, but he went into anaphylactic shock and was struggling to breathe

After Natasha was given the devastating news that there was nothing that could be done to save her husband she spent Luke's final days at his bedside, along with her two children.

She added: 'I knew from Luke's will that he would not want to remain on life support so we took him off life support and it was within a minute he was gone.'

Natasha could not bear to be at Luke's side as the machines keeping him alive were turned off. 

Natasha said: 'That was not the way I wanted to remember Luke. I wanted to remember him alive and well. I have pictures all around the house at times in Luke's life when he was happy - pictures of the family all together.

'That's what I look for to help me remember him. If I focus on the hospital, it is too much. I want to focus on all the good times we had together.'

Natasha only married Luke last year following a whirlwind romance after the couple met at the headquarters of Olympus, where Luke was president of the Medical Systems Group.

She said: 'It was so crazy - it all happened so fast, between the time we met and then got married and a house.

'Even though we were only married for a year, it felt like we were together for 40 years, that was just how it felt.

'It just all clicked into place really early on in our relationship but because we were both going through divorces, we wanted to be extra cautious.

Natasha performed CPR on Luke until an ambulance arrived and took him to hospital, however by the time he arrived he was already declared brain dead 

Natasha paid tribute to Luke as a father, saying he treated her two children as if they were his own. She added: 'Not many people are lucky enough to find what me and Luke found in each other'

'Looking back on it, we would have gotten married after a month or so of dating - we knew it was right, it was that soulmate connection.

'Not many people are lucky enough to find what me and Luke found in each other.'

Luke has four teenage children from his previous marriage and treated Natasha's two children, Rhonin, four, and Arija, two, as if they were his own.

Natasha had Rhonin from her first marriage but a month after she started dating Luke, she discovered she was three months pregnant with Arija - to her ex-husband.

She said: 'Most people would have run in the other direction but Luke's response was "you poor thing, what can I do to support you".

'That blew me away - that really spoke so much about his character. He really was "dad" to them.

'Rhonin has really understood everything. He seems to be coming around and is glad daddy is heaven, but he really is comprehending some complex things.

'My daughter, who is two, she just knows that daddy is gone.

'When people come through the door she will say "daddy" and go looking for him, so she has not really comprehended the fact that he is not coming back yet.'

She paid tribute to her husband's approach to business which saw the Royal London University graduate rise through the ranks of Olympus during a career spanning nearly a quarter of a century.

Natasha said Luke was her 'soulmate', calling him the 'perfect guy' and saying he was always happy

Despite a 17-year age gap between the two, Natasha described her husband as 'young at heart' and said the couple enjoyed days out together, including sightseeing and kayaking

Natasha, a member of the Mormon Church, said her faith is the only thing keeping her going after Luke's death

'If you were the janitor or if you were the Olympus president in Tokyo, you were the same to Luke. He had such a dynamic personality and everyone at his work warmed to him.

'But he will be missed by as many children as he will adults - kids just gravitated towards him.

'He was always serving people, always happy and he really was the perfect guy. I can't think of a single thing he did wrong - which was the only thing that would frustrate you with him.

'I would ask "are you ever upset or miserable or do you ever have a bad day" but he was always so happy and realising how blessed he was compared to others so instead would be looking to see how he could help others.'

Despite the age gap of 17 years between the pair, Natasha described her husband as 'young at heart', with the pair enjoying kayaking as he became a 'true American'.

Natasha is a member of the Mormon Church and said her faith was helping her through the dark days since Luke passed away last month.

She said: 'Without my faith and without my children, there is no way I would be dealing with this as well as I am.

'The one thing that our faith believes is that there is life after death so when I die Luke and I will be re-united. I just have to get through the next 50 or 60 years and then I will see him again.

Luke previously lived in Chelmsford but moved to Pennsylvania in 2011 after landing a dream job as president of the medical systems group Olympus Corp, where he met Natasha

'And for the kids I have to get up each day and eat food, feed them and take care of things around the house and manage the estate now that Luke has gone.

'They are giving me the drive to move forward each day.'

Natasha, who worked as clinical project co-ordinator at Olympus, said she was now under financial pressure after Luke's death because the couple did not have a life insurance policy in place.

She cannot afford to pay the mortgage on her own and may even have to sell the family home.

Luke worked at the Olympus headquarters in Center Valley in Pennsylvania.

A spokesperson for Olympus in America said: 'We are deeply saddened by the sudden and unexpected loss of our friend and colleague, Luke Calcraft, president of the Medical Systems Group at Olympus Corporation of the Americas.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Luke's family and friends.'
