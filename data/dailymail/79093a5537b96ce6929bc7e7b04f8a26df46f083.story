A slaughterhouse worker who stabbed his ex-girlfriend's male friend to death after wrongly believing the pair were dating has been jailed for 25 years after being convicted of murder.

Jason Taylor, 21, shared an eight-month relationship with Jodie Emery, 26, but after the pair broke up he became jealous, often going to her house in Preston, Lancashire, to spy on her.

Convinced she was seeing another man he sent the mother-of-two a text on September 22 last year which said: 'Last chance, otherwise things are going to turn sour, tell me who is there'.

He then went to Miss Emery's home and kicked in the front door. With her two young daughters asleep upstairs he began fighting with friend Adam Wilson, 25, who she said had been invited over for drinks.

During the struggle he used a knife he had bough on a previous holiday with Miss Emery to fatally stab Mr Wilson in the thigh. 

During his trial at Preston Crown Court, Taylor tried to claim that that there was no innocent reason for Mr Wilson being in the house, and denied intending to kill him, but a jury took just an hour and a half to decide he was lying.

Today he was handed down a life sentence and told he cannot apply for parole until at least 2040. 

Judge Anthony Russell QC told Taylor: 'The victim was someone completely unknown to you and had done you absolutely no harm at all and yet was murdered by you for no other reason other than he happened to be the person at the home of Jody Emery.

'This was a particularly shocking murder because it was pure chance Adam Wilson was the person who you vented your rage on because you were unable to accept your relationship with Jody Emery was finished. 

'People have to accept that sometimes things go wrong in their lives and relationship do sometimes end. You were not prepared to accept that. 

Taylor kicked down Miss Emery's front door on September 22 last year, and began fighting with Mr WIlson (pictured), fatally stabbing him in the thigh

'You persistently badgered her to the extent that you became a nuisance.

'You were not prepared to let her move along with her life or yours because of your obsessive jealousy. She was perfectly entitled to see other people, it was none of your business if she did so. 

'You murdered this man for no other reason other than he was in a place he was perfectly entitled to be. He had done no wrong.'

The court earlier heard that Taylor, a slaughterhouse worker who spent his days deboning animal carcasses, had been in an eight-month relationship with Miss Emery.

The pair had shared a caravan holiday together in Scarborough, but after they returned home Miss Emery secretly terminated a pregnancy. When Taylor found out he flew into a rage and the pair split.

Unable to accept the break-up Taylor began texting and calling Miss Emery on a regular basis begging for them to get back together, and often went to her house to watch her, often coming up to look through the windows.

Two days before the murder took place Taylor was at pub the Tardy Gate. When he spotted one of Miss Emery's former boyfriends he became angry, smashed a window and tried to punch the man.

Louise Blackwell QC said on the day of the killing Taylor texted Miss Emery saying: 'I miss you. Maybe in time you'll want to try again'. 

She asked him not to contact her but later that evening he sent her another text saying: 'Can I come for cuddles?'

Miss Emery responded, 'you being weird then', to which he said: 'I'm not my head is just f..ked' and he allegedly rang his mother asking for a knife he bought during his holiday with Miss Emery. 

The court heard he was spotted cycling towards her home during which he sent her another text asking her who she was with.

She texted back, 'on my own I keep telling you' at which point Taylor said: 'last chance otherwise things are going to turn sour, tell me who is there, last chance'. 

Emery replied 'wtf' and tried to call him three times with no response.

Miss Blackwell added: 'The defendant then arrived at the front door and used considerable force to kick his way through the bottom panel. 

'Once inside the incident starts immediately in the hall between the defendant and Adam Wilson and spilled into the lounge. 

'Miss Emery was trying her best, obviously unsuccessfully to break apart and stop the defendant being able to get at Adam Wilson but it did not stop.

'All three of them ended up on the sofa in the living room. Adam Wilson was on the bottom, Jodie had got herself between him and the defendant lay on top but she described the repeated blows being struck to Adam Wilson.

During his trial at Preston Crown Court, Taylor (pictured right) had tried to claim there was no innocent reason for Mr Wilson to be with Miss Emery, and denied intending to kill him, but a jury ruled otherwise

The court heard that after Miss Emery split from Taylor following an eight-month relationship he became jealous, constantly texting and calling her, and often going to her house (pictured) to spy on her

'She did not initially realise there was a knife involved but after a period of time during which blows were being reigned down, the defendant then stood up. 

'At that stage she saw he was armed with that knife, a knife she had seen before which he has bought when they were on holiday in Scarborough.'

Taylor fled the scene and dumped the knife as Miss Emery rang for ambulance. 

Mr Wilson was pronounced dead in hospital just an hour later from the 6cm long and 7.5cm deep fatal wound which was to the inner right thigh.

Doctors also found cuts on his back, buttocks and legs, and abrasions on the rest of his body that were consistent with a struggle.

On the night of the killing Taylor text Miss Emery saying ''ast chance, otherwise things are going to turn sour, tell me who is there' before kicking in her front door while her two young daughters were asleep upstairs

When Taylor was arrested he said: 'No you are not serious are you, you are joking, he is dead? He attacked me I have done nothing wrong'.

Shortly afterward police recovered the black-handled and blood-stained knife.

In a video interview Miss Emery said Wilson was 'just a friend' whom she had known for a couple of months. 

She said Taylor would turn up at her home and she she believed he would carry on turning up if she did not reply to his messages. 

She said: 'Jason had been constantly texting all the time. I made sure I was answering and replying to the phone calls. I didn't tell him that I was with anyone because I knew he would not like it.'

In a statement Wilson's mother Diane said: 'Adam would have been frightened at time of his death. I'm so angry at the compete irrationality to understand how someone could do that to my son.'
