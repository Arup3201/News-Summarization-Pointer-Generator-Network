Aston Villa left-back Joe Bennett has joined Brighton on a season-long loan move from Aston Villa.

Bennett was bought by Villa for around £2.75million in 2012 after impressing at Middlesbrough but found his opportunities limited last season through injury and Ryan Bertrand’s arrival on loan.

Paul Lambert’s capture of Aly Cissokho has seen Bennett look for game-time elsewhere and the 24-year-old passed his medical with Sami Hyypia’s Championship side on Wednesday.

Brighton were set to complete a deal for another left-back, Stephen Ward, last week, but Burnley stole in at the eleventh hour to sign the player.

Bennett has two years left on the Villa contract he signed two years ago, and has made 30 appearances in the Premier League for the club so far. 

He is the fifth player to leave the club on a season-long loan this summer after Nicklas Helenius, Antonio Luna, Yacouba Sylla and Aleksandar Tonev
