A police officer accused of punching a woman to the ground at a Philadelphia street party has been acquitted of assault.

Highway 
Patrol Lt Jonathan D. Josey II, 40, was suspended by the police after footage of the incident at a festival associated with the city's Puerto Rican Day parade was posted online.

A judge has ruled that Lt Josey was not guilty of assault after the video allegedly showed him striking Aida Guzman, 39, in the face during the confrontation last year.

Fired? Highway Patrol Lt Jonathan D. Josey II was suspended following the incident last year

The verdict, which was made by the judge without a jury, was met by applause from supporters of Lt Josey in the Philadelphia courtroom.

He is now hoping to get his job back.

Ms Guzman testified through a translator that she had been hit by Josey with a closed fist to her mouth, CBS News reports.

Lt Josey told the court that she had refused to drop a bottle she was holding when asked and that he had tried to knock it out of her hand.

He said he was 'shocked' when she went down when his hand struck her face.

Judge Dugan said the footage of the incident in the video was 'troubling,' but that there was more going on at the scene than the clip revealed.

He said the scene of the confrontation between the policeman and Ms Guzman was 'chaos' and 'volatile,' according to CBS.

Josey said outside the courtroom that he had never intended to hit Guzman. She is now reported to be considering filing a civil law suit against Lt Josey.

She suffered a swollen and cut lip as well as injuries to her hands and arm during the incident.

Lt Josey - is seen in the video apparently striking Ms Guzman after someone else in the crowd throws water at the officers.

In March 2010, Josey was cleared in the fatal shooting of an armed robber at a 7-Eleven and was later cited for bravery. He was stabbed in June 2010 when he was trying to break up a fight at a bar when he was off duty.

Shortly after the footage appeared on the line, the Deputy Police Commissioner Richard Ross described the video as 'disturbing.'

The 36-second video, which was first 
posted on YouTube the same day as the parade was 
watched by hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom voiced outrage. The
video shows a number of people milling around during a street party that followed the parade.

A number of officers appear to be surrounding a
car and as their backs are turned, someone throws an unidentified 
substance at them which some viewers speculated was either water or 
'silly string.'

When Lt 
Josey turns around, he zeroes in on Ms Guzman and as she walks away, he appeared to hit her from behind and knock her to the floor.

Ms Guzman was then arrested and was issued a summary citation for 
disorderly conduct, on which police reported she had thrown beer at 
them.

Friends of Lt Josey described soon after the incident as a loving father and caring member of 
the community.

They also revealed that three years ago, he and Crime Scene Unit
Officer Terry Lewis started the Life or Death Initiative, a nonprofit 
organization that teaches violence prevention to teens and ex-offenders.

Around 1,500 people attended the Puerto Rico Day parade.
