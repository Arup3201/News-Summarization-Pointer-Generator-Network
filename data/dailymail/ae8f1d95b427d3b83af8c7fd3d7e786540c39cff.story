A California man's romantic proposal to his girlfriend almost ended in complete disaster when their sunset hot air balloon ride crash landed into the Pacific Ocean on Sunday.

Hundreds of beach goers at Cardiff-by-the-Sea watched the balloon veer dramatically off course around 7pm, just after Eric Barretto had successfully proposed to girlfriend, Jennilyn Buenaventura Garcia.

The pilot could not return the stricken balloon to shore, so dozens of surfers swam out to meet the balloon as it hovered over the surface and watched as Barretoo and Garcia jumped from the basket into the water.

Escape: One of the three passengers dives into the sea off the coast of Cardiff-by-the-Sea on Sunday evening during the disastrous hot air balloon proposal of Eric Barretto 

Proposal: Eric Barretto got a 'yes' from girlfriend, Jennilyn Buenaventura Garcia, on Sunday evening

Landing: The hot air balloon dips into the ocean in Cardiff-by-the-Sea, a beach community in Encinitas, after a man proposed to his girlfriend during their sunset ride Sunday

Help: The hot air balloon dips close to the ocean as it is pulled in by surfers in Cardiff-by-the-Sea

Relieved he managed to propose before his dramatic rescue, Barretto said that at least he and his fiancé will have a story to tell at their wedding.

'It's unforgettable. That's all I can say,' said Barretto. 'I don't know if we'll do it again.'

Matt Lawson, who witnessed the beach crash said that he initially did not know that the pilot and passengers were in trouble.

'We all just thought that, you know, they were just having some fun, just getting their passengers close to the water,' said Lawson to ABC News.

Witnesses: Hundreds watched from the shore as the balloon ditched and bobbed in the sea - its torch trying and failing to lift the basket

Unusual: The balloon veered dramatically off course at around 7pm on Sunday and attracted an audience of hundreds

'Someone dropped a rope out of the balloon, and all of the surfers started piling over.'

Cellphone footage from the accident shows Barretto and his fiancé jumping out of the basket into the sea.

The balloon pilot was identified as Tim, who works for Panda Air Bear Balloon Flights.

He told NBC San Diego that strong winds caused the balloon to be pushed off course westwards, leaving him no choice but to attempt to either use onshore winds to push them back or to ditch in the water.

Not so happy: A sign wishing Garcia a 'happy anniversary' was attached to the side of the basket before it ditched in the sea on Sunday evening

After the surfers pulled the balloon as close to the shore as possible the basket landed in the surf said Encinitas Marine Safety Captain Larry Giles.

'Between the lifeguards and the bystanders in the water, the surfers here at Cardiff reef, everyone did a great job and they got the balloon back up onto the beach without injury,' said Giles.
