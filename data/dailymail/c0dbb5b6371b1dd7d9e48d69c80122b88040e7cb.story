Fresh from rescuing a last-minute  draw against Chelsea in so-called 'Fergie Time', Manchester United players arrived punctually for the launch of a collection of watches inspired by the 1999 Treble-winning season.

Manager Louis van Gaal will accept no excuses for lateness after official timepiece partner Bulova released three watches - available in silver, blue and a red version, that will be worn by players and staff. 

United legend Andy Cole, who was part of the historic Treble-winning team, was present for the launch - while the first team squad, including Robin van Persie, Angel di Maria and Luke Shaw but not Phil Jones, posed in their club suits under grey skies at Old Trafford.

United are renowned for their exhaustive list of global partnerships, which have helped fund the club's unprecedented spending spree in the summer that saw the likes of Di Maria, Shaw and Radamel Falcao arrive

According to the club’s official website, United currently has 29 sponsors and commercial partners - including everything from diesel engine parts to potato chips.

They have a world record shirt sponsorship deal with Chevrolet, worth £47million-a-year for seven years - while they also receive £17m-a-year to have their training kits sponsored by Aon.

Van Persie has also been used to promote a brand of tomato juice across Asia

In the latest full-year accounts released for the club, covering the 2012-13 season, United’s commercial operation pulled in £152.5m.

However that figure has grown dramatically, with estimates suggesting that figure will be closer to £190m when the next full-year results - which cover 2013-14 - are released later this month.

Accounts covering the current season are expected to show commercial income closer to £240m when they are released next year.

As a result, the Old Trafford commercial operation will also allow the club continue to sign elite players and pay massive wages, comparable with captain Wayne Rooney who earns £300,000 a week.
