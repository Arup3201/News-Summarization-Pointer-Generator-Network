Away from the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, it was back to work today for Stephen Hawking following Eddie Redmayne's Oscar for playing the celebrated physicist. 

The 72-year-old, who has motor neurone disease, was too ill to attend last night's dazzling ceremony, settling instead for a hearty message of congratulation on Facebook.

These images of the world-renowned professor at Cambridge University are a timely reminder of the gulf between his life of study and the acting career of his 33-year-old counterpart. 

Back to work: Stephen Hawking was pictured arriving at Cambridge University today, just hours after Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar for playing the scientist

The physicist, who has motor neurone disease, said he was 'proud' of Redmayne for winning the Oscar

Accompanied by two nurses who were seen waving and smiling. Mr Hawking spent the afternoon working at the campus, where many of the scenes for the film were shot.

He was wrapped up warm in a blanket as he was wheeled from the car in his specialist wheelchair, which has a computer screen for him to communicate.

Hawking is the director of research at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Cambridge, and is one of the world's most respected scientists.

The professor had earlier congratulated the actor on Facebook after he won the award for best actor following his performance in The Theory of Everything.

He wrote on Facebook: 'Congratulations to Eddie Redmayne for winning an Oscar for playing me in The Theory of Everything Movie. Well done Eddie, I'm very proud of you.' 

Redmayne, who had already won a Bafta and Golden Globe for his performance as Hawking, spent seven months preparing to play the famous scientist.

He met him briefly before filming began and dedicated his award to Hawking and his family last night.

The actor said the award for was 'all of those people around the world battling' motor neurone disease and said that the Oscar belonged to 'Stephen' and his ex-wife Jane, as well as the rest of their 'exceptional family'.

Joy: Eddie Redmayne collects his best actor Oscar from Cate Blanchett last night

The Theory of Everything tells Hawking's story from his early years as a student at Cambridge University to his relationship with his future wife Jane.

It also shows him dealing with the onset of motor neurone disease as he learns to use a wheelchair and speak through a computer.

Redmayne won over even more fans last night with his excited and emotional response to his 'extraordinary' big win, breaking off midway through his acceptance speech to exclaim 'wow'.

'I don't think I'm capable of articulating quite how I feel right now. I'm fully aware that I'm a lucky, lucky man,' he said. 

Clutching his Oscar, Redmayne added: 'I will be its custodian and I promise you I will look after him, I will polish him, I will answer his beck and call and wait on him hand and foot.' 

Accepting his trophy from Cate Blanchett, a shocked Redmayne also told his new wife Hannah: 'I love you so much,' before joking about the trophy: 'We have a new fella coming to share our apartment'.

Later, Redmayne said that being on stage was 'an extraordinary euphoria.... something I will not forget in a hurry'.

Backstage, he told reporters that he had been trying to 'bury all this frenzy of nerves and white noise and trying to speak articulately and, of course, you then forget everything'.

He admitted that despite now being an Oscar winner, it had not always been easy to find work.

'I've never really had much choice in work-wise, I've always had to fight for the jobs and fought pretty hard for them, certainly for The Theory Of Everything,' he said.

'So as far as where you go from here, just retaining employment will keep me very happy.'

Redmayne, who has also won a Golden Globe, Bafta and Screen Actors Guild for the performance, thanked his 'staggering partner in crime Felicity Jones' who lost out on the leading actress Oscar to Julianne Moor, who starred in Still Alice.
