Christmas is always a boom time for the perfume industry — the run-up to the big day accounts for more than half of all perfume sales for the year — but it seems that it’s not all going to be Dior and Chanel sitting under the tree.

Last week it was revealed that scents from stars such as Britney Spears, Beyoncé and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini are outselling established fragrance brands such as DKNY, Hugo Boss and Gucci by as much as three to one.

But are these perfumes actually any good, or are they simply trading in on a name?

To find out, we asked fragrance expert, Callum Langston-Bolt, of Les Senteurs, London’s oldest independent perfumery, to blind-sniff some of the best-selling celebrity scents from The Perfume Shop, and give his verdict, before revealing to him exactly who was behind each one.

The results may put some noses out of joint . . .

CHERYL FERNANDEZ- VERSINI

Storm Flower, £27 for 50ml

THIS smells very soapy and clean because it’s based on the sort of notes often used to fragrance washing powder. Add peach — as you’ve got here — or white florals, and you get something slightly reminiscent of very posh laundry detergent.

Musk scents like this are very cheap to make in a laboratory and can make a fragrance long-lasting, but unless they’re mixed well, smell a bit flat.

This is not as sugary as some, and really rather nice. Initially I thought that this was Justin Bieber, but I can see how it works for Cheryl playing on her girl next door image. Nice and gentle if you like clean floral scents. 4/5

VICTORIA BECKHAM

Signature, £14.99 for 75ml

This is exactly what you’d expect from a celebrity fragrance: generic and rather cheap. It’s very fruity, very sugary with some white florals in there. They can be quite sweet and sickly, but this isn’t. The floral notes are very thin. I’d guessed this was Cheryl, because as an international style ambassador you’d expect better of Victoria. 2/5

JUSTIN BIEBER

Collector’s Edition, £39.50 for 100ml

This has more of the sugar-iness I mentioned. These are the sort of cloying scents you’ll find yourself choking on, when you’re sitting behind someone on the bus who is wearing too much of it. I thought it was Rihanna, but it turns out to be teen icon Justin Bieber. I can see the appeal of the bottle, which comes with a gold record charm. 2/5

KATY PERRY

Killer Queen, £19.99 for 100ml

Goodness, this is much more interesting than many of the others. There are slightly richer floral notes going on in here. You’re not being hit in the face with sugar, there’s a warmer, more gourmand vanilla note in it as well. I can smell a nice orange blossom, rose and a bit of patchouli. My first guess was Victoria Beckham as I had faith in her doing something a bit different. I wouldn’t have thought it was Katy Perry — and the bottle’s quite interesting, too. 4/5

ONE DIRECTION

You & I, £19.99 for 100ml

This is very syrupy and fruity. There’s quite a bit of peach in here — it’s a popular scent so many fragrances use it. But I’m also getting that horrible plasticky apple note that you’ll find in DKNY’s Be Delicious. It really hits you in the back of the throat, but if you like that perfume, you might very well like this. There’s a bit of jasmine and tuberose in the heart but it’s basically very summery and very fruity. To me though, it smells like a shampoo.

I thought it was Beyoncé’s. And although I’m sure the pentagon-shaped bottle is meant to represent the five members of the band, it’s quite uninspiring. 2/5

BRITNEY SPEARS

Fantasy, £19.99 for 100ml

This is really generic — it’s like the paint-by-numbers recipe for the sort of sugary white floral that you see at this end of the market. They always start with something fruity, mango or peach, then there’s some white flowers at the heart — jasmine, tuberose, maybe gardenia — and the base is wood or musks.

But there’s no real depth to it, it’s just sugar. I suppose finding out it’s Britney isn’t that much of a surprise, and the bottle is one of the ugliest I’ve seen.1/5

BEYONCÉ

Rise, £19.99 for 100ml

This is actually really nice. It’s quite clean, quite fresh, and has a very classic eau de cologne style to it. At the top it’s very citrussy, the florals are basic but not overly sugary and overall it’s quite refreshing. Initially I guessed Lady Gaga, but then I thought Rihanna — I really wasn’t expecting Beyoncé. And, while it’s pleasant, I wouldn’t say it was the ‘empowering’ scent for women she claims she was aiming for. 4/5

NICKI MINAJ

Onika, £28.50 for 50ml

Urgh, this smells like those disgusting bright green sour apple sweets you find — or like an apple vodka alcopop. There’s something really childish about it: there’s a bit of blackcurrant or peach coming through, but it’s all fruit and all sweet. It’s like being in a sweet shop — really horrible. I thought it had to be One Direction because it was so pre-pubescent, and there had been absolutely no attempt to make it more sophisticated.

You’d have to be a real fan of breakthrough artist of the year Nicki Minaj to want this. 1/5

LADY GAGA

Eau de Gaga, £31.50 for 50ml

Mmmm, this isn’t bad at all. There’s something of the Nineties about it — it reminds me of the citrussy, clean scents that were very popular then, such as L’Eau D’Issey from Issey Miyake.

After the Eighties, when everything had been quite dark and heavy with scents like Christian Dior’s Poison, the Nineties trend was for lighter and zestier scents.

And there’s a nice pepperiness to it too. I did guess this was Lady Gaga and I’m impressed by the bottle too: it looks very high end in a Tom Ford or Chanel type way. 5/5

RIHANNA

 Rogue, £19.99 for 75ml

Another of those very fruity fragrances, this is slightly more subdued and less cloying than some of the others. There’s a strong blackcurrant note in it, but in a very Ribena-esque way, and some sort of muted strawberry as well

I thought this had to be Britney as it seemed to be targeting young teenagers and I was taken aback to find out it was Rihanna’s. Her whole persona is about being outrageous so you would expect her to be doing something different. But there’s nothing sexy about this —it’s incredibly unprovocative for someone who courts controversy. 3/5
