You can now cruise along the Thames in London and take in the city's iconic landmarks from the comfort of your own home on board Google Street View's virtual riverboat.

A 30-mile stretch of the river has been captured, between Richmond in the west of London and Woolwich in the east, using Google's 360-degree Trekker cameras.

The route takes users through the centre of the capital, past the Houses of Parliament, the London Eye, Canary Wharf and the Millennium Dome.

Google used its Trekker cameras fitted to the front of a riverboat to capture the 360-degree shots along the Thames. Users can travel on board the virtual boat and rotate the view around to see famous London landmarks such as the Houses of Parliament, pictured

The Street View Trekker camera took more than a year to develop.

It weighs 40lb and includes a multi-lens 15-megapixel camera, an on-board hard drive, and enough battery to run for an entire day.

Cameras are positioned to give a 360-degree view so every possible angle is captured and photos are automatically captured every 2.5 seconds.

The Trekker can be fitted inside a backpack meaning it can be worn by Google photographers.

The River Thames is the first river in the UK and Europe to be mapped on Google Street View.

Google worked with the Port of London Authority and fitted its Trekker camera to the front of a boat as it travelled along the river.

Ed Parsons, a geospatial technologist at Google said: 'The Thames offers some of the most scenic and iconic views of London from arguably the best vantage points the city has to offer.'

To see the images, including this shot of Tower Bridge, users can drag the Pegman above the river on Google Maps. A thick blue line will appear. If they drag the Pegman onto the river, but not onto this blue line, they will only see photos taken by other Google users on its Panoramio service

Google started to photograph canals across the UK earlier this year, after it mapped the Grand Canyon last year.

Other recent projects including mapping the Galapagos Islands, the Barrier Reef and the wreck of Mary Celeste in the Atlantic Ocean.

There are more than 3,500 cities in 53 countries available on Street View, plus various underwater locations in oceans and parts of the Arctic and Antarctica.
