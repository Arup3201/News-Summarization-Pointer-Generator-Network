Nascar racing driver Danica Patrick has become the first woman to take pole position at the Daytona 500 race in Florida.

Patrick, 30, also became the first woman to become the pole-sitter in any Nascar top division event - the latest in a long line of achievements for one of the most prominent women in motorsport.

Patrick posted a qualifying lap of 196.4mph in her number 10 Chevrolet, completing the 2.5mile-long route at the Florida superspeedway in 45.817 seconds yesterday.

She will line up alongside four-time Nascar champion Jeff Gordon on the front row of the grid this Sunday, for the first race in the 2013 Sprint Cup Series.

She was tipped to take pole after topping the second practice session on Saturday before qualifying.

After her lap, she had to wait for two hours while 37 other drivers took their turns to try to knock her off top spot with faster laps.

Patrick, from Roscoe, Illinois, qualifies as a rookie as it is only her first full season in the sport - and became the first rookie to take pole since Jimmie Johnson in 2002.

Patrick, competing for Stewart-Hass Racing, told CNN that the magnitude of her achievement would only sink in after the race itself.

She said: '[It] is something that happens down the road. In the moment, it's about thinking about what I need to do for next Sunday and trying to make some more history.

'If you're anywhere but the front row, it's hard to see on race day.'

She paid tribute to her crew, claiming her involvement was only 10 per cent compared to their 90 per cent input.

But crew chief Tony Gibson said it was an equal effort.

He said: 'I'm proud of her. She didn't falter.'

Patrick told CNN's Don Lemon: 'I've heard stories about a kid, a boy or a girl, saying, "But mommy, daddy. That's a girl that's out there racing."

'And then they can have that conversation to say that, "You can do anything you want to do, and gender doesn't matter." Your passion is what matters. And that's cool.'

Three-time Daytona 500 winner Gordon 
said: 'This is great from the sport and the rest of us will benefit from
it. I'm proud to sit on the front row with her.'

After the qualifying session, Gordon 
asked Patrick to pose for a photo with his five-year-old daughter Ella, 
who had requested an introduction.

The Daytona 500 is the series' most prestigious race - considered to be Nascar's equivalent of the Super Bowl.

The Florida track's breezy coastal location makes it difficult for a driver to break away on their own from the chasing pack.

It is one of four races in the Nascar calendar where power is restricted to 500bhp.

Before making the switch to Nascar, Patrick raced in the IndyCar series.

Her Indy Japan 300 win in April 2008 made her the only woman so far to win an IndyCar race.

Patrick will be looking to repeat her Indy Japan 300 win from April 2008 this Sunday at the Daytona 500

In 2005 she was voted Rookie of the Year at the Indy500 after finishing fourth in the race.

By 2009, she recorded the highest finish by a woman at the Indy500 when she finished third behind Helio Castroneves and the late Dan Wheldon.

Sir Richard Branson tried and failed to woo her to Formula 1 to join his Virgin Racing team for the 2010 season. She was due to test for a seat at Honda F1 in 2008 before the team pulled out of the sport.

The previous qualifying records for a female driver were held by Janet Guthrie.

She qualified ninth in two 1977 races and 18th for the 1980 Daytona 500.
