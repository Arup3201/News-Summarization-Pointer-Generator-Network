A reptile park near Sydney is calling for public assistance in catching deadly funnel web spiders to help make antivenom.

With warmer weather approaching, spider season has begun but the Australian Reptile Park is experiencing a shortage of spiders to milk.

Managing operator Mike Drinkwater says there are safe ways to capture the arachnids and urges the people to exercise caution when undergoing the process.

The Australian Reptile Park are calling on the public to catch funnel web spiders to help make antivenom

Managing operator Mike Drinkwater says there's a shortage of spiders at the park which is why they need public assistance to source more of them

'We're at an all time low in spider numbers,' Mr Drinkwater told Daily Mail Australia.

Previously the reptile park, in Central Coast - north of Sydney, conducted 1500 milkings for antivenom production but this year they hope to double that figure.

'The reason why we want so many is because we're aiming for 3000 milkings this season,' Mr Drinkwater said.

'This provides us with the antivenom which is a huge contributor in saving lives.'

Mr Drinkwater says it's vital the spiders are caught the right way.

'Use a 20 to 30 centimetre container and place the opening of the jar near the spider,' he said.

'Then use a ruler to gently flick the spider into the container. Then put the jar upright and place the lid on.

'It's also important to put in some moist soil into the jar and also poke some air holes.' 

While catching spiders can be a dangerous task, Mr Drinkwater says the public have helped the reptile park source them in previous years.

Mr Drinkwater says the park began the spider milking program to produce antivenom in 1981.

There were reportedly 13 deaths in NSW from funnel web spiders but since the reptile park program was established, there have been no further recorded deaths.

'Our park is the sole provider of funnel web poison for antivenom,' he said. 

There are various drop-off points across NSW including spider hotspots in southern parts of Sydney, Newcastle and the Blue Mountains.
