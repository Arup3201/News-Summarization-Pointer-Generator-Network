To viewers of her reality show, the demise of Tori Spelling's marriage to Dean McDermott seemed like an inevitability.

Beset by rows and hit by his cheating, the two appeared certain to split.

But now, MailOnline can reveal, the pair are very much back on - thanks to Dean's decision to quit True Tori, the show which detailed their ups and downs.

Tori had initially pushed back against him not appearing in the reality show, but when she checked into hospital in October, the couple experienced a rapprochement.

Now they have spent Thanksgiving together in Las Vegas, after switching on its Christmas tree as a family and spending the rest of the week there - and are said to be much happier as a result.

In the family: The whole Spelling-McDermott clan switched on the Christmas lights at Las Vegas's Venetian Hotel, starting a Thanksgiving week spent in the city. The children are, from left, Finn, Stella, Hattie and Liam.

'It's true, Tori and Dean were talking about ending their marriage when she checked herself into Cedar's Sinai hospital,' says a source close to the dramatic duo.

'Tori was very ill with a mystery virus, and she was worn down both mentally and physically. She'd lost weight and couldn't stop crying over her unhappy life.

'Tori had been working night and day to try and make a go of her TV series, Mystery Girls, as well as filming True Tori. And on top of that, she was dealing with a cheating husband and caring for four little kids under the age of 7.'

The Mystery Girls actress and McDermott have four children together - Liam, aged seven, Stella, aged six, Hattie, aged three, and Finn, aged two.

Tori - born Victoria - was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital on October 18 for pneumonia and severe bronchitis, but she attributed the symptoms to stress.

'I don't deal with stress well,' admitted Spelling, who also spent six days in the hospital for a migraine back in April.

The stress came after McDermott admitted cheating on Spelling in an affair which took place last year. He later checked into reheab.  

But according to the source, while Tori lay in her hospital bed contemplating a split, Dean surprised her, by stepping up to the plate at home.

'Dean was amazing,' says the source. 'He kept the home fires burning by making sure everything ran smoothly.

'He's always been a perfectionist, and Tori's even accused him of being a little OCD. So when push came to shove and he had to be there for her and the kids, he stepped up and took charge.

'Dean would start out the day by getting the four kids up, dressed and fed, before taking them off to their respective schools.

'And while he had help at home with the little ones, he took it upon himself to drop the two older kids off and pick them up himself, knowing the children were worried about their mother.

'He made sure the house was in tip top shape too,' says the source. 'They have a housekeeper, but Dean cleaned out cupboards, and closets, and washed and folded all the laundry himself.

'And he even cooked meals ahead so that when he went up to the hospital to visit Tori in the evenings, the kids had home cooked meals to enjoy.

'He also made sure the bills were paid, and the shopping was done. And he was sure to be home before bedtime to help with homework, read stories and tuck the children into bed.

'Tori says that the way Dean took control and was there when she needed him, reminded her of the man she married, and she felt she couldn't have concentrated on getting better if Dean hadn't taken so much responsibility.'

The source says that after Tori arrived home, the atmosphere around the house changed and she admits seeing Dean through a new pair of eyes.

'Tori was shocked to see how orderly everything was,' says the source. 'Not only was the house spotless and the kids clean,

'I don't like them seeing me as sick': The 41-year-old reality star said her four children 'weren't even fazed by me being in the hospital. They're used to it. And I don't want them to grow up thinking, "Mom's sick"'

'Dean also filled the house with flowers and managed to put together one of her favorite meals: grilled lamb chops with strawberry mint sauce and baked potatoes.'

The source says that being reminded of Dean's devotion's made Tori take another look at him. Despite all their problems, she knows that when push comes to shove, she can count on her husband to care for his family. So she's decided to recommit herself to the relationship. And as part of this renewed commitment, she's honoring Dean's wishes to leave True Tori.

'At first Tori was upset that Dean wanted to leave the show and she felt he was basically abandoning ship,' says the source. 

'Then she realized that if he no longer wanted to make his life public, she had to respect that decision and let him go. In the end, Tori hopes that by letting Dean make his exit, it will improve their relationship. 

'And she's determined to keep fighting for her family even if it means continuing the reality show on her own.

'Only time will tell if Tori and Dean can make love work,' says the source. 'But it doesn't look like either one of them is quite ready to throw in the towel just yet.'
