Hillary Clinton has said she was obliged to defend an accused rapist out of professional duty when she was a lawyer in the 1970s - a case in which she was ready to discredit the 12-year-old victim.

She even intimated that she knew the accused was guilty by revealing her shock that he passed a lie detector test.

Mrs Clinton was given the case in 1975 when she ran the University of Arkansas’ legal aid clinic. The accused was Thomas Alfred Taylor, 41.

Retort: Hillary Clinton said she was obligated to defend an accused rapist in 1975

Last month an audio recording emerged of an interview Mrs Clinton gave in the mid-1980s in which she chuckled several times as she described how she helped set the accused free.

The recording drew fierce criticism from the victim, who is now 52.

Mrs Clinton has now spoken about the case for the first time, telling Mumsnet that it was her duty to defend the accused.

She said: ‘When I was a 27-year-old attorney doing legal-aid work at the law school where I taught in Fayetteville, Arkansas, I was appointed by the local judge to represent a criminal defendant accused of rape. I asked to be relieved of that responsibility, but I was not, and I had a professional duty to represent my client to the best of my ability, which I did.

‘When you’re a lawyer you often don’t have the choice to choose who you will represent, and by the very nature of criminal law there will be those who you represent that you won’t approve of.

‘But at least in our system you have an obligation, and once I was appointed, I fulfilled that obligation.’

The audio recording in which Mrs Clinton laughs about the case was published on YouTube by the Washington Free Beacon.

She is heard chuckling as she describes how her client beat a lie detector case.

She said: ‘I had him take a polygraph, which he passed – which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.’

She also appeared to find the fact that a crime lab accidentally threw away bloodied underwear funny – it was DNA evidence potentially linking Taylor to the crime.

Court documents show that Mrs Clinton's case was to be based around discrediting the victim.

She wrote: 'I have also been told by an expert in child psychology that children in early adolescence tend to exaggerate or romanticize sexual experiences and that adolescents in disorganized families, such as the complainant’s, are even more prone to exaggerate behavior.'

However, in the end, the missing evidence meant the case against Taylor collapsed. 

In the end he pleaded guilty to a lesser offence.

Clinton said: 'Got him off with time served in the county jail, he’d been in the county jail for about two months.'

After hearing the recording, the victim, who has not been named, told The Daily Beast: ‘Hillary Clinton took me through hell. I realize the truth now, the heart of what you’ve done to me. And you are supposed to be for women? You call that [being] for women, what you done to me? And I heard you on tape laughing.’

Mrs Clinton's book 'Hard Choices', meanwhile, is on track to be one of the year's top nonfiction books despite another slip in sales.

Nielsen BookScan says 'Hard Choices' sold 26,000 copies during its third week of publication.

Clinton's memoir about her years as secretary of state was published June 10 and sold more than 80,000 copies the first week and nearly 50,000 the second week. The numbers don't include e-book sales, which comprise around 30 percent of the overall market.

'Hard Choices' has been the No. 1-selling nonfiction hardcover on The New York Times' list for three straight weeks but has slipped on Amazon.com, ranking No. 57 as of Thursday night.

Clinton's 'Living History' was published in 2003 and sold more than 1 million copies.

She is expected to run for president in 2016.
