Brazilian legend Pele has been named a lifetime global ambassador for Santos.

The 74-year-old expressed his delight at the deal on Thursday which followed reports that his health is continuing to improve in hospital after he left intensive care.

He tweeted: 'I am proud to share with you that @santosfc has announced me as lifetime ambassador for the club.

Pele signed his first professional contract with Santos as a 15-year-old in 1956

'It is exciting to know that I will be wearing the shirt of my favorite team for the rest of my life. 

'I expect to keep bringing pride and joy to Santos fans all around the world.'

The three-time World Cup-winner was admitted on November 24 after being diagnosed with a urinary tract infection that stemmed from a November 13 operation to remove kidney stones.

On Thursday, Santos, which signed Pele to a global ambassador agreement in 2013, offered him a lifetime contract during the renewal process.

Santos will continue using Pele's image in its marketing, publicity and social media campaigns, and will have the presence of the Athlete of the Century at its events. 

The new agreement also includes a licensing deal which allows Santos and Pele to create and release products together.

Pele spent 18 years at Santos during two spells with the Brazilian club, scoring 1,091 goals and winning 48 championships, including two Club World Cup titles in 1962 and 1963.

Santos FC president Odílio Rodrigues said: 'Pele and Santo brands will always be related. We expect this agreement to last forever, just like Pele's legacy, and that is essential for our brand strategies. We have the greatest player of all time in our history, in our present and in our future. We are so pleased to be able to make this announcement at this time.'

Pele added: 'Santos believed in me when I was young, and shaped me to become a successful player, teammate and man. The club is in my blood, it is with me everywhere I go and I talk about it in every part of the world. I am looking forward to working with Santos on its strategies and programs to ensure it is recognized as the best football club in Brazil.'
