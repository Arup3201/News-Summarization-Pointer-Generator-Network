His day job is to manufacture the parts that keep Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg at the top of the Formula One world championship.

But Worcester City’s Sean Geddes will be sharing the headlines with them after putting the brakes on Coventry’s FA Cup hopes.

Geddes played alongside Danny Welbeck, Tom Cleverley and Ravel Morrison in Manchester United’s academy but was released at the age of 16 and thought his chance would never come again.

However, the midfielder’s textbook penalty and fantastic second-half finish made him the toast of Worcestershire and football romantics everywhere last night.

‘Words can’t describe it, this is the best moment of my career,’ said a beaming Geddes. ‘For the penalty, I was so nervous and I knew the keeper who came on. He said to me: “I know where you’re going” but obviously he dived to his right and I went down the middle. For the second, I couldn’t have hit it any better. It was magical, that’s the one word I can say. I loved it.’

This was Worcester City’s greatest moment since dumping Liverpool out way back in 1959. Players and management celebrated like they’d won the Cup in front of 3,220 jubilant travelling fans at the final whistle.

But this was no plucky, backs-to-the-wall underdog story. The Conference North outfit made a mockery of the 64 places that separated them from their League One opponents, who famously lifted the Cup in 1987.

Although aided by Coventry goalkeeper Lee Burge’s moment of madness — he kicked out at Daniel Nti and was shown a straight red card shortly before half-time — fearless Worcester were excellent value for their place in tonight’s second round draw.

Coventry manager Steven Pressley described his team’s performance as ‘embarrassing’ and put it alongside their 1989 humbling at Sutton United as ‘one of the worst results’ in the club’s history.

They won a penalty shortly after falling behind but captain Reda Johnson saw it saved by Nathan Vaughan. And although Johnson’s 81st-minute reply ensured a nail-biting finale —which included seven minutes of stoppage time that seemed like an eternity for the away fans — they never looked like scoring again.

Worcester boss Carl Heeley, who played 536 times for the club, started another chapter in their history and rounded off a week he’ll never forget.

He said: ‘It just caps a perfect week, my third daughter Mia was born last week and I have been up doing night feeds since then.

‘It is my proudest moment in a long association with Worcester — payback for a long injury in the late nineties and some heartache when we lost our ground. We are still in exile but this makes it all worthwhile.’

Worcester have been ground-sharing with Kidderminster for 18 months after departing St George’s Lane, their home since 1905.

WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE

Conference side Dover caused an upset when they dumped League Two Morecambe out. Former Fulham trainee Stefan Payne scored the winner.

Hemel Hempstead Town of the Conference South came within two minutes of drawing with Bury, 61 places above them. Nathan Cameron and Daniel Nardiello spared the Shakers’ blushes late on.

Derby County showed their promotion potential with a 5-0 thrashing of Wolves and returned to the top of the Championship table.

PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND
