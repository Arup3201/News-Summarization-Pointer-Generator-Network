This is the stomach turning moment a karate kid is left with his car key lodged deep in his foot after a 'one in a million' accident.

Bartek Turek, 18, was working on self-defence moves when he was thrown backwards onto the floor.

His car keys, which had been tucked in his pocket, fell out and the teenager slammed on top on the upturned point before landing.

Painful: Bartek Turek's car key was left lodged deep in his foot after the freak karate accident

Grappling: Bartek and a partner go through the moves and his keys are just visible from his right-hand pocket

Down you go: The black belt is thrown backwards onto the ground but his keys have fallen out

That hurts: Bartek's partner looks aghast as they realise his keys are impaled in the sole of his foot

However, instead of screaming in pain, Bartek simply moans when he realises what has happened.

Bartek, from Illinois, U.S., was taken to hospital where it took doctors seven hours to safely remove the keys.

An X-ray of his left foot shows the key was wedged into his sole but luckily did not cause any damage to the bones or nerves.

But the black belt did need to use crutches for two afterwards.

He told The Sun: 'My foot slammed it before it fell over. The chances were one in a million.

Ouch: Bartek was taken to hospital where it took doctors seven hours to remove the lodged keys

Lodged: An X-Ray shows how far the keys penetrated his foot but did not damage the bones or nerves

'They took X-rays to make sure it did not fracture a bone or any nerves.'

Video of the accident shows the keys dangling from his gi before he hits the ground.

He and his partner are shown laughing and joking before the accident.

It is even more unfortunate as it was Bartek's last day at the club.

Positive: Despite the pain the teenager was able to smile and he was only on crutches for two weeks
