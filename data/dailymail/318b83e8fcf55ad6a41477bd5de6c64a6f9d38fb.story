Babies learn how to use their muscles by twitching in their sleep, according to controversial new research.

Scientist Mark Blumberg has claimed babies' brains are learning how to use their muscles and limbs while they are deep in slumber.

Video footage showing the jerky movements of babies' arms and legs has been used in Professor Blumberg's research.

Silent night: This controversial research puts to bed the idea that babies twitch in their sleep because they are dreaming

Subtle difference: The involuntary twitch in the baby's arms pulls his arms off the base of his crib. They are momentarily suspended in midair

Do all babies do it? The research studied footage of other mammals. These three kittens move in a similar way to the baby

Planning ahead: The involuntary movements are said to be the brain's way of learning how to move the body's muscles

The babies' twitching has been 
compared to the involuntary movements made by animals including rats and
squirrels, showing a similarity between the two.

In a new paper published in Current Biology, Blumberg argues that the 
movements, known as myoclonic twitching, play a key role in the 
development of the nervous system.

During his research, the University of Iowa professor analysed the twitching sleep movements of rats.

When
he slowed down the video, he found the seemingly-random jerks had a 
pattern.

The movement of limbs is often copied, from right to left or 
vice versa.

Blumberg said this copied behaviour is the brain's motor
system learning how to build up towards more complex movements.

'The
brain is trying to understand, what are my limbs, how many do I have, 
and how many joints, and muscles, and how do they all move together?' he
told National Geographic.

'So
that later, you can fire off a command somewhere in your mind, and 
generate a whole series of joint movements that would bring a bottle to 
your mouth, or make it possible to step.'

It is most commonly assumed that the adorable involuntary movements made by babies are a sign that the child is dreaming.

In
order to try and better understand these movements, scientists are now 
building robots which mirror the neurological patterns of the brain.

When they perform muscle contractions, they can see which circuit patterns emerge.

The
research remains controversial however. Sleep scientists continue to 
debate the reasons why humans sleep and how much is necessary.

Insight: When Professor Blumberg examined footage of sleeping mammals he found a pattern in the jerky movements

Getting some rest: Footage of this sleeping squirrel shows the sleeping motion up-close

Controversial: Sleep scientists debate the reasons why humans sleep and the way in which they sleep

Research: Psychologist Dr Blumberg believes the twitching explains how infant mammals learn more complex movements
