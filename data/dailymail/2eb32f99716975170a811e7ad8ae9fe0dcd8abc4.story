Tucking into a burger alone, he gazes adoringly at a picture of a woman propped up on the table.

This photo of an elderly man dining at an In-N-Out Burger restaurant in California captured hearts across the world when it was posted online by a diner last week.

Now, the pensioner has revealed the woman in the picture is his beloved wife, whom he was married to for 55 years and who passed away five years ago.

Heartwarming: This photo of an elderly man dining at an In-N-Out Burger restaurant alongside a photo of his late wife of 55 years captured hearts across the world when it was posted online by diners last week

The man, who has been captured eating at the fast food chain alongside photos of his late wife several times, told intrigued customers that he met his soul mate when they were both 17.

They dated briefly, before losing contact when he went off to war and her family moved away from California, according to a diner who posted an image of the pensioner on Imgur.

While he was serving for his country, the man constantly thought about the woman he loved and on his return to America, decided to look for her.

For the following ten years, he desperately searched for his love, refusing to date anyone else and answering claims that he was crazy with: 'I am. Crazy in love.'

Not alone: The man (pictured in another photo at the In-N-Out Burger restaurant) told intrigued customers that he met his soul mate when they were both aged 17. Sadly, his beloeved wife passed away five years ago

Reduced to tears: Diner Madina Bashizaduah, from San Francisco Bay Area, posted the above photo of the pensioner alongside the caption: 'Oh my god I just died! He has a picture of his wife with him as he eats!'

Finally, he visited a barber shop in California, where he discovered the barber's daughter was, in fact, the woman he had spent so long searching for.

She, too, had spent the past decade searching for him, so he proposed and they wed. They then spent an amazing 55 years together. It is unknown whether they had children.

Since his wife's death in 2009, the pensioner revealed he takes at least one photo of her with him everywhere and even kisses it goodnight. He also still celebrates her birthday and their anniversary.

One diner, Madina Bashizaduah, of San Francisco Bay Area, posted a photo of the man on Twitter, alongside the caption: 'Oh my god I just died! He has a picture of his wife with him as he eats!'

The image was quickly shared more than 7,000 times, prompting other customers to upload interesting quotes that the pensioner had said during their conversations with him.

These included: 'I was a very rich man. Not with money, but with love', 'I never had a single argument with my wife, but we had lots of debates' and 'Tell your wife that you love her everyday'.

They also featured the sentence: 'People are like candles. At any moment a breeze can blow it out, so enjoy the light while you have it.'
