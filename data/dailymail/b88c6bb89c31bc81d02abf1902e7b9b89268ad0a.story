A devastated husband broke down in tears as he today told how he found his wife collapsed on the floor after she was repeatedly stabbed by her jealous lover because she ended their eight-year affair to save their marriage.

Jilted Martin Bunch, 44, is accused of stabbing Jeanette Goodwin 19 times in the chest at her Southend home in Essex and then leaving her to bleed to death on her patio.

Mark Goodwin, 49, a gas engineer, told the jury how he and his wife of 21 years had been planning a barbecue at her home in Southend, Essex, when Martin Bunch walked into the front room.

A jury at Chelmsford Crown Court, Essex, heard Bunch went straight up to the mother-of-three and allegedly plunged a five-inch kitchen knife into her chest.

Mr Goodwin told the court: 'He walked straight up to Jeanette and from where I was standing I thought he had punched her in the stomach which I thought was very odd at the time.

'Jeanette reeled back and she was holding herself and there was blood everywhere. Jeanette said, 'he has stabbed me'.

'She grabbed me at the waist to go round me and get out of the living room door.'

He told the jury how Bunch had appeared 'smug' as he struck out with the knife and then said: 'I told her I would kill her'.

Mr Goodwin continued: 'He was not in a frenzy - he was just calm.'

Mr Goodwin said he tried to fight off Bunch by picking up a large lamp and swinging it at him in a desperate bid to stop him. 

He told the court how he had rushed 
out of the frontdoor of the couple's  cul-de-sac home hoping to find his
wife but then was locked out as he realised she was still in the 
property. 

Mr Goodwin then rushed to the back of the house and realised panels from the 6ft-high fence had been removed.

He spotted his wife slumped to the ground next to a hedge in the backgarden.

Mr Goodwin, who then called 999, said: 'There was blood everywhere - blood on Jeanette, blood on the plants.

'She was slumped against a hedge at 
the bottom of the stairs next to the patio - she had two wounds that I 
could see were not bleeding anymore and

'I remember thinking "that's not good".'

As Mr Goodwin gave his evidence from the witness stand the defendant could be seen smirking and at times shaking his head. 

At one point during the proceedings, 
Bunch appeared to be mouthing words towards Mr Goodwin from behind the 
re-enforced glass in the dock.

The jury heard how Mrs Goodwin had 
engaged in an eight-year-long affair with Bunch but broke it off in late
2010 after confessing to her husband.

John Dodd QC, prosecuting, said: 
'This was a brutal and determined attack by the defendant - a man who 
was unwilling to accept Jeanette Goodwin had called an end to their 
affair.

'He set out on that summer’s day almost a year ago intent on killing her or, at least, causing serious harm.'

She called an end to the romance in late 2010 but complained to police about a number of incidents of harassment by Bunch throughout the beginning of the following year. 

Bunch was handed strict bail conditions banning him from contacting Mrs Goodwin or going to her house - but he was caught breaching those conditions on a number of occasions.

Less than a month before her death Mrs Goodwin made a statement to police after she received voicemails, text messages and unwelcome visits from Bunch.

The court heard the statement was triggered by a conversation with Bunch’s own mother, Veronica Webb, who had warned her that her son had spoken of his intent to kill his former partner.

In a statement to police Mrs Goodwin said: 'This behaviour has left me fearful for my life. I feel extremely harassed from all the phone calls and texts I have received. I just want him to leave me alone.'

Despite this statement and evidence Bunch had removed an electronic tag used to monitor a 6pm-6am curfew order, he was once again granted bail at Southend Magistrates Court, just four days before Mrs Goodwin’s death.

The court heard that on the day of the attack Mrs Goodwin had seen Bunch on a grassy bank overlooking her garden but failed to report the breach of bail conditions to police.

Mrs Goodwin later alerted police by pressing a specially installed panic alarm at 7.39pm but when officers arrived at the house six minutes later they found Mrs Goodwin lying on the floor with numerous stab wounds.

Bunch was arrested less than 30 minutes after the attack at his mother’s home half-a-mile away.

He was taken into custody where officers described him as 'verbally aggressive and emotional'.

He refused to answer any questions and officers later reported hearing Mr Bunch shout: 'I can’t believe I killed the woman I love. I f****** loved that woman.'

Bunch, from Southend, Essex, denies a single charge of murdering his ex-partner.

The trial continues.
