A council has had to pay out more than £350,000 in compensation to workers in the last five years - including to one employee who claimed her uniform was too tight and another who suffered a splinter.

Northamptonshire County Council paid out £200 for a 'large splinter in hand causing injury' and £5,500 for a 'spinal injury' caused by a 'poorly fitting uniform.'

The council also forked out £500 to a worker who had a blind fall on them and another £11,125 to a member of staff who had a shutter door spring open on him which 'threw him into the air' and injured him.

Price tag: The council paid £5,500 for a 'spinal injury' caused by a 'poorly fitting uniform.'

On top of this they were forced to pay out a staggering £32,010.96 for a worker who slipped on some food in the dining hall while carrying a table causing a 'contusion or bruise'.

Figures obtained through a Freedom of Information request also show that the biggest claim was £90,517.86 for a fireman who injured his lower back during a fire drill.

The numbers relate to a period between July 2006 and July 2011.

The council paid £7,500 to a claimant who 'went to sit down when someone moved the chair...jarring her back.'

Another alleged 'pots and pans' fell out on her when she opened a cupboard at work causing her to receive a soft tissue injury - and £12,000 in compensation.

The council also has some ongoing claims for sunburn while on a training course injuries caused to one woman 'due to a pupil jumping at her'.

A large splinter meant an injury to an employee's hand - and a £500 bill for the council

Jonathan Isaby, Political Director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The bill to taxpayers for compensation claims has got unacceptably high.

'While some staff might have legitimate claims because of negligence, there has been a worrying rise in the compensation culture across local government.

'Taxpayers should not be footing the bill for cases where a bit of common sense would have avoided an accident and there has to be a degree of personal responsibility.

'Accidents do happen, and council staff should not see an accident as an excuse to fleece the rest of us out of our hard-earned cash.

'It is therefore important that councils should fight any questionable claims to protect taxpayers' money from being abused.'

A spokesperson from Northamptonshire County Council said: 'The welfare of our staff is a top priority but with over 15,000 employees, unfortunately accidents can occasionally happen.

'We follow health and safety policies and ensure staff carry out their activities and maintain their premises in ways that minimise the risk of accidents occurring.

'We also have appropriate procedures in place if things do go wrong, to ensure any lessons are learned and that we can continue to maintain excellent standards of safety.'

Northamptonshire is not the only council to pay out thousands to injured workers.

Rotherham Council, in South Yorkshire, paid £9,128 to a 61-year-old cleaner after he stumbled over a mop handle, falling and pulling a groin muscle.

Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act this year have revealed that since 2007 the same council has paid out a whopping £1million in compensation to other workers for minor slips, trips and falls.

A teacher, carer, administrative assistant and a weed sprayer received £26,867 between them after falling off chairs.

A 53-year-old town hall admin assistant tripped over a 'protruding' dining table leg in 2010 and was handed £14,452.

The same year, a labourer was given £10,450 after he was working in the garden of a council house and fell into a hidden pond.

Newport Council is currently being sued after a pub landlady injured herself at a rock concert.

A heavy metal music fan is suing Newport Council for £25,000 compensation after a 'horrifying' slip in a puddle of vomit at a live gig.

Pub landlady Lindy Butcher, 39, fell over in the sick as soon as she arrived at the Newport Leisure Centre in Wales and missed the opening of the Whitesnake concert while she was being disinfected.

She suffered bruising and soreness to her knees as well as pain through her neck and shoulders and muscle spasms between her ribs.
