Alexander Kristoff of Norway sprinted to victory in the first stage of Paris-Nice on Monday to claim his fifth win this season as former world champion Tom Boonen retired with a broken collarbone.

The Katusha rider edged Frenchmen Nacer Bouhanni and Bryan Coquard in the finale of the 122.1-mile stage from Saint-Remy-les-Chevreuse to Contres that was marred by Boonen's crash.

The one-day classics specialist heavily hit the ground about 10.6 miles from the finish after colliding with another rider.

Boonen withdrew from the race and his upcoming classics campaign could be in jeopardy.

Michal Kwiatkowski, who won Sunday's prologue, retained the race leader's yellow jersey.

The race continues Tuesday with a 106.9-mile trek from the ZooParc de Beauval zoological park to Saint-Amand-Montrond in central France.
