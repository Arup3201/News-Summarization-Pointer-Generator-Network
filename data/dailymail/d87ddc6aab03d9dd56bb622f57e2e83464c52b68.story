It promises to be one of Australia's most exclusive nights out complete with private helicopter rides, a VIP nightclub room, a masseuse and plenty of premium alcohol.

And it can all be yours if you've got a spare $50,000 to spend.

Bond nightclub in Melbourne's CBD, which opened almost two months ago, has started selling its Green Room experience to cater to wealthy international visitors.

But even the club's part-owner Ozzie Kheir says it's a crazy amount of money to spend.

The Green Room in Bond nightclub in Melbourne's CBD can be privately hired for $50,000

The package promises private helicopter rides, a VIP nightclub room, a masseuse and premium alcohol

But even the club's part-owner Ozzie Kheir says it's a crazy amount of money to spend

'It's a big show off factor,' Mr Kheir told Daily Mail Australia.

'I wouldn't spend $50,000 on the package, that's for sure, it's so over the top.'

Mr Kheir said he offers $10,000-$15,000 packages at another nightclub venue he owns but they are not exclusive enough to satisfy some patrons.

'Some clients said "Is that the best the package you've got?" so we decided to go one bigger.'

He was also inspired after he hosted a couple of sheiks at his Adelphi Hotel and was stunned to see the amount of money they were prepared to spend.

Mr Kheir said so far three people had booked the package, with the first one to be hosted in March during the Melbourne Grand Prix 

'They booked out entire floors – they booked a room just to put their luggage in,' Mr Kheir said.

'It's very common overseas where they do spend that money.'

Mr Kheir said so far three people had booked the package, with the first one to be hosted in March during the Melbourne Grand Prix.

The package includes helicopter rides, SUV transport to and from the helipad, private security, three waitresses, masseuse, photographer, Cuban cigars and specialty desserts.

The premium liquor on offer includes an engraved 15L bottle of Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label champagne, Dom Perignon Oenotheque 1975 and 6L Belvedere Cradle.

But Mr Kheir said the Green Room experience was flexible, and while a helicopter is on offer that could easily be changed to a boat on request.
