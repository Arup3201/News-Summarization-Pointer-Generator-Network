They are ferocious predators, armed with razor-sharp teeth, who lurk in the depths of the world's largest oceans.

So unsuspecting rowers were more than a little shocked when they spotted a shark's fin - in a north London park.

The rowers were at a private event on the boating lake in Finsbury Park, when they saw the Great White Shark's fin poking above the surface of the water.

Boaters were happily enjoying themselves at a private rowing on the boating lake in Finsbury Park, north London, when they spotted something rather unusual in the water

As the boaters relaxed in the north London park, a fin belonging to a Great White Shark suddenly appeared above the surface of the water

One of the guests pointed in disbelief and shouted to his friend as he saw the shark fin move across the water

The creature came uncomfortably close to the rowers' boats, causing a sudden outbreak of panic on the usually-calm lake.

One of the rowers shouted 'look at that' as he cowered away from the ominous fin. One of the girls screamed so loudly that the boat nearly toppled over.

But, luckily for the rowers, the shark fin was all part of a prank to celebrate Shark Week on Discovery Channel, which starts today.

The stunt was set up using a hand-carved polystyrene fin mounted onto a 3m tubular frame, with internal ballast and flotation devices.

One of two girls was relaxing on the lake, seemingly unaware the shark fin was coming uncomfortably close to their boat - but her rowing partner suddenly spotted the fin out of the corner of her eye

When the girl finally turned and spotted the ominous fin gliding towards out, she let out a petrified scream

One girl was so frightened when she saw the fin, pictured left, that she almost toppled out of the boat in disbelief. But the girl was soon laughing when she realised the fin - made from polystyrene - was not real, right

These two men cowered away from the water in fear as the fin raced towards their rowing boat

But the men soon peered closer in curiosity once they realised the fin was probably not real

A macabre rowing boat -
 with a huge bite taken out of it - was also planted at the scene to add to the eery atmosphere.

The prop was created by BAFTA award-winning art director and special effects designer Jamie Campbell.

Shark Week, which runs all week, will feature dozens of programmes about the ocean predators.

Once the rowers realised the makeshift fin was part of a prank, they relaxed and carried on boating

One of the girls laughed as she spotted the writing on the side of the fin, which revealed the prank was to promote Shark Week on the Discovery Channel

The promotion on the side of the fin reassured boaters that a Great White Shark was not lurking in the lake

Some of the programmes include Airjaws Finding Colossus, in which shark experts Chris Fallows and Jeff Kurr visit the legendary Seal island in South Africa in search of Great Whites.

There is also Mythbuster Jawsome - which counts down the 25th biggest shark myths of all time - and Sharkpocalypse, which explores the trend of sharks moving closer to shorelines.

The line-up also features Megalodon, which explore the myth around the massive prehistoric shark.
