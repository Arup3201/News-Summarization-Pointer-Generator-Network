In the Bible, Jesus managed to turn water into wine with the wave of a hand - the Miracle Machine  isn't quite that quick but it can transform everyday liquids into plonk in just three days.

Developed by wine experts in California, the machine can even make different types and styles of wine, including Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay.

Users can track the progress of their wine using a free smartphone app, and its makers claim the wine produced is as good as a $20 bottle, for the equivalent of $2 (£1.20).

The Miracle Machine, pictured, is due to go on sale later this year for $499 (£299) each - if its California-based inventors achieve funding. Once on sale, DIY wine makers will be able to buy ingredient kits for a variety of different wine types and styles from Amazon at the equivalent of $2 (£1.20) a bottle

To create wine using the Miracle 
Machine, users add a sachet of ingredients, choose the type and style of
 wine they want to create, and start the machine.

They can then monitor the fermentation process via a free iOS or Android smartphone app.

The app will also alert the user the fermentation has finished and the wine is ready to drink.

The pair haven’t revealed the exact 
science behind the machine, but said the fermentation chamber uses 
electrical sensors, transducers, heaters and pumps ‘to provide a 
controlled environment for the primary and, as needed, secondary 
fermentation stages.’

Miracle Machine was created by the founders of Customvine in California.

CEO Kevin Boyer is a sommelier and founded the Boyanci winery in Napa Valley, while Philip James is a British entrepreneur and founder of wine site Lot18.

For example, a digital ‘refractometer measures the sugar content of the liquid during the fermentation process, while an air-diffuser passes filtered air through a so-called ‘micro-oxygenated’ channel.

The machine also has an ultrasonic transducer under the chamber that can speed up the flavour and development of the wine. 

‘Just like the Bible miracle, it literally turns water into wine, with just the addition of a few ingredients in a fraction of the time and cost it would normally take,‘ explained Boyer.

After a user has chosen a wine they want to make, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, they can choose what style they want, including ‘fruity’, ‘forward’ and ‘lively’.

The pair has created a prototype Miracle Machine and is now looking for funding to produce more.

If successful, the Miracle Machine is expected to go on sale ‘later this year’ for $499 (£299) each.

Owners will then be able to buy the grape concentrate, yeast, and other sachet of ingredients from the Miracle Machine website, or from Amazon.

Each kit will make a different type of wine and the firm will launch with six variations including Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay from Napa Valley, a Pinot Noir from Oregon, a Tuscan blend from Italy, Sauvignon Blanc from Sonoma, plus a red and white from Burgundy.

They said they expect to add another five to ten varieties over the next three months.

The exact price of the ingredient kits hasn’t been announced, but Boyer claims it will equate to around $2 (£1.20) a bottle for a wine that he would expect to pay '$20+ (£12) for, at minimum.’

The firm also said it’s planning to create a low cost monthly wine club, where customers can pay less than $10 (£6) a month for a range of kits - enough to make a bottle of wine a week.

Because the wine is produced and bottled under air, not an inert gas, Boyer and James said the wine will only keep for between one to two weeks.
