To kick off her new career, Kirsty Bertarelli appeared on Madeley on Sunday, Richard Madeley's Radio 2 show and was spotted leaving the recording studio looking relaxed in jeans and a cowboy jacket

Most up-and-coming popstars have a couple of  things in common: they're generally young and struggling for money.

But one aspiring perfomer smashes those stereotypes.

As Britain's richest woman, the former Miss UK shares a 
£7.4billion fortune with her Swiss husband Ernesto, whose family made its money in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.

She's also well out of her teens: the billionairess is 41 years old and has three children.

To kick off her new career, glamorous Kirsty appeared on Madeley on Sunday, Richard Madeley's Radio 2 show.

She was spotted leaving the recording studio looking cool and casual in jeans and a cowboy jacket.

The former Miss UK - who went on to take third place in the 1989 Miss World pageant - sang her new track, Indigo Shores, live in the studio.

The single will be released on May 12th but is currently available to download on Kirsty's website.

On her upcoming tour, Kirsty is preparing to shun
 the trappings of wealth.

She may be accustomed to private jets and holidays aboard a £100million superyacht, but she has pledged to fly economy, wear ‘off-the-peg’ stage clothes and perform solo gigs as plain old Kirsty B.

Staffordshire-born Kirsty has already experienced chart success in Switzerland, where she lives on the shores of Lake Geneva.

Crowned Miss UK in 1988, she met Ernesto, an America’s Cup-winning sailor, on the London party circuit.

At around that time, she was experiencing some success as a songwriter - her tune Black Coffee became a UK No 1 for the girl group  All Saints in 2000, the year she married.

Mrs Bertarelli put her fledgling pop career on hold after her nuptials. But now, 14 years later, she's decided to give pop stardom another go and has recorded an album, Love Is, which includes a duet with Boyzone star Ronan Keating.

She insists she is not being bankrolled by her husband, whose grandfather started the multinational drugs company Serono.

She said: 'It's probably why he's such a good businessman. He says "it can't be something that costs huge amounts. It's got to be real." 'This is not a problem. When I was in Switzerland promoting my music to the radio stations, everyone was amazed I would just travel around with them, in the car, in the van.

She added: 'It doesn't bother me. I'm quite happy to be casual and not made up. I can never even remember to put my jewellery on.

'I'm from Staffordshire and I've been very fortunate but I'm the same girl I used to be. I've always been a creative and sensitive person.'

Speaking to the Sunday Times, Mrs Bertarelli, who splits her time between Geneva and a townhouse in Knightsbridge, London, added: 'I'm not wanting to be the new Rihanna or Lady Gaga. I'm just a singer-songwriter.'

Despite having more money than, well, every other woman in the country, the 41-year-old mum of three is putting her luxurious lifestyle to promote her new single, seen here leaving the Radio 2 studio on Sunday

She added: 'I don't think Ernesto is going to stop working and rely on my income quite yet but it still feels fantastic to make your own money.

'It feels so much more special to buy a present for my husband. It's important to a woman's self-worth and self-belief to be making some money.'
