It may not be James Bond’s iconic amphibious Lotus, but suave millionaires can dive the depths of the ocean in their own two-seater submarine, which resembles a Ferrari. 

The diminutive sub can dive to depths of up to 300ft (91 metres) so passengers can look at fish while staying dry and is small enough to be stowed on a yacht.

The HP Sport Sub 2, which has been dubbed the ‘sub-sea Ferrari’ because it loosely looks like the supercar, is powered by six thrusters and can be used for six hours without recharging.

Luxurious: The HP Sport Sub 2 (pictured), which costs a cool €1 million (£724,375 million or $1.1million)  is powered by six thrusters and can be used for six hours without recharging

It has luxuries on-board such as leather sports seats and air conditioning, as well as power steering so the underwater world can be navigated effortlessly, underwater lights and a navigation system.

The vehicle can be controlled by a touchscreen and also has an underwater communication system.

But all this luxury and convenience comes at a cost of €1 million (£724,375 million or $1.1million) when the vessel launches in August.

Stable: The vehicle weighs 4,850lbs (2,200kg) and is 4ft 5inches (136cm) tall. The sub’s wide design enables passengers to board on the surface and remain stable under water

The nine foot long (2.7 metre) submarine can travel at up to 4mph (6kph) and is the latest creation by Dutch company U-Boat Worx, which has been pioneering ways to travel under the waves since the 1980s.

It weighs 4,850lbs (2,200kg) and is 4ft 5inches (136cm) tall. 

The sub’s wide design enables passengers to board on the surface and remain stable under water.

The firm says the vehicle is the ideal toy for millionaires because it’s small enough to fit inside an on-board locker on a yacht and be towed behind a car.

‘This remarkable submersible is suitable for all superyachts from 30 metres up,’ said Bert Houtman, founder of U-Boat Worx.

‘The design is attractive but above all it’s safe and functional. We’ve adopted a very different look compared to traditional submersibles without compromising on safety and ease of use. 

‘The result is a modern and streamlined submersible with fantastic performance. Whether at the surface or underwater its speed and manoeuvrability are exceptional.’ 

James Bond's amphibious Lotus Esprit (pictured) may be the pinaclke of cool when it comes to personal submarines in films, but the HP Sport Sub 2 offers people the chance to see the fishes in luxury

He claims that the model outperforms every submersible in its class.

‘Thanks to its ultra-low height and its minimal footprint can fit it easily in a tender garage without refitting your yacht.

‘It has an astoundingly low weight so existing cranes can be used for easy launch and recovery.

‘These specifications make the HP Sport Sub 2 the most compact submersible, with the performance and comfort you expect.

‘This “sub-sea Ferrari” is the ultimate sport submersible for the discerning owner.’
