If Jack Wilshere wanted to go quietly about his business, a tweet just before kick-off catapulted him firmly into the spotlight.

As the England midfielder prepared for a game that was always going to provide a stern examination of Arsenal’s credentials, Piers Morgan proclaimed to his 4.2million followers that he ‘bet @JackWilshere has a big game today. Convinced he’s going to have a huge season. #quality’

No pressure, then. Coming just 48 hours after Arsene Wenger complained that Wilshere had been put ‘under too much pressure’, Morgan’s declaration guaranteed every step the 22-year-old took would be scrutinised.

Don't believe the hype! Jack Wilshere struggled to impose himself during Arsenal's draw at Everton 

This, after all, is the type of game in which he should be making a difference.

The thing with Wilshere, though, is that we are still waiting for him to put it all together and run a game that matters, to dominate the type of contest in which Arsenal have habitually fallen short down the years.

After another troubling evening on Merseyside, the wait goes on. If Arsenal were collectively abject for 83 minutes, failing to deal with Everton’s slick passing and movement, Wilshere epitomised their shortcomings, not getting a look-in as James McCarthy and Gareth Barry dominated.

He set the tone for a petulant display as early as the fifth minute, complaining without justification to referee Kevin Friend after being outmuscled by the energetic Steven Naismith. Sulking and scowling, Wilshere shuffled around on the periphery and never looked to take charge.

There have, of course, been well-documented fitness problems down the years but this effort — coming after a similarly anonymous showing against Crystal Palace in which he was substituted after an hour — never threatened to get out of first gear.

Why me? The England midfielder argues with referee Kevin Friend at Goodison Park on Saturday evening

When Everton broke forward, Wilshere never had the pace to snap back and help Mathieu Flamini, while his occasionally forays into the opposition area lacked the wit or invention to cause problems.

As his frustration mounted, it came as little surprise when he was booked for scything down Barry.

‘I believe at the moment he should not respond (to criticism), just focus on his game,’ Wenger argued. ‘At the moment I believe he should just focus on being fit, present and improve physically. If Wilshere can maintain his physical fitness, he can have a huge career.’

Yet that is a big ‘if’. Wilshere has long been championed as the player who will provide the fantasy in Arsenal and England’s midfield but, at present, his form merely adds weight to the acerbic comments Paul Scholes made about him last spring.

When Wenger has a full complement of midfielders, where does Wilshere fit in?

It should be pointed out that Wilshere — roundly booed by Everton supporters when Wenger did the decent thing and ended his evening on 73 minutes — was not the only Arsenal player to let his manager down badly.

How much did you pay? Arsenal's new striker Alexis Sanchez looked hopelessly out of sorts on his own 

Mesut Ozil started his first competitive game since winning the World Cup with Germany but his meaningful contributions could be counted on the fingers of one hand.

Indeed, his loose ball enabled Everton to break and score their second goal before half-time.

Alexis Sanchez, meanwhile, looked hopelessly out of sorts deployed as the lone front man.

The experiment lasted 45 minutes, during which the Chilean never had a shot and Everton’s swagger nearly took the game away from Arsenal.

All, clearly, is still not right with the Gunners. At least the changes Wenger made in the second half worked magnificently and the fighting spirit they showed to rescue the contest might be a trigger for them to have a big season.

Whether the same can be said for their lacklustre No 10 remains to be seen.
