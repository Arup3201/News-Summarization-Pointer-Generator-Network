Citizenship: Adolf Hitler was given honorary citizenship of Dietramszell in Bavaria back in 1933

A small town in Germany has tried and failed to revoke the honorary citizenship awarded to Fuehrer Adolf Hitler back in 1933.

The vote by the councillors in the town of  Dietramszell in Bavaria - the state where Nazism was born - is an embarrassment that shows the sneaking admiration that some in Germany continue to harbour for the dictator 68 years after his death in Berlin.

Thousands upon thousands of communities in Germany fell at Hitler's feet when he became Fuehrer and Chancellor, giving him the keys to the city, sending him gifts and making him an honary dignitary.

To this day an average of five municipalities a month delve into their archives, see that the mass murderer is still on their books and then vote to remove him.

Mayor Leni Gróebmaier thought it was about time Dietramszell did the same after town hall archivist Agnes Wagner found Hitler was still a top dog in town dating back to March 1933, the month he came to power.

The nearby town of Münsing carried out a similar vote a few days earlier which passed without discussion.  But the town councillors of Dietramszell refused to fall into line.

'It would be a distortion of history, the whole debate is laughable,' said council member Traudi Fröstl.

Another member Josef Hauser said: 'Honourary citizenship goes with death. It is all a very long time ago.'

And a third council member asked: 'Can we not distance ourselves from living politicians? That would be much wiser.' In the end eight councillors voted to kick Hitler off the VIP list, and eight voted to keep him.

German media had a field day at the town's expense. 'It doesn't get more stupid than this,' said local governor Josef Niedermaier. 'Fascism is too important a topic for stupid political games.'
