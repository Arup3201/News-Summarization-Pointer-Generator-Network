Russell Brand's book Revolution has put him squarely in the influential literature list with Hilary Mantel

Other new entries include actor Idris Elba, Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton, television presenter Clare Balding, musicians Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith, and digital sensation Jamal Edwards.

Russell Brand joins fellow authors Hilary Mantel, Ian McEwan and Kate Mosse on the influential literature list, after publication of his anti-government treatise Revolution.

The guide writes: 'Those who deplore the histrionic celebrity’s woolly-minded populism and woeful grasp of economics are deceiving themselves if they think he lacks influence.'

It adds, 'Whether he is considered a revolutionary or just an irritation, Brand’s influence over the masses is a force that cannot be denied.'

YouTube vlogger and author Zoe Sugg - better known as her online alter ego Zoella, is named in the 'New Media' list along with her boyfriend, fellow YouTuber Alfie Deyes and prolific tweeter, Stephen Fry.

Prince Charles is included on this year's list in a surprising category of architecture.

The guide, which describes the Prince of Wales as a 'pioneer for sustainable development' explains: 'Perhaps seen by some as a controversial influence over the realm of architecture, Prince Charles is an undoubted influence none the less.  

Victoria Beckham, the Duchess of Cambridge and Cara Delevingne all make it on to the most influential fashion list along with Kate Moss and David Gandy.

Debrett's outlines Kate Middleton's power: 'Her commitment to British brands sees sales of household labels soar – what she wears one day sells out the next.

'Whether playing volleyball in wedges or hockey in heels, fashion’s favourite royal combines understated, conservative charm with youthful elegance as an ambassador of British style.' 

In art Banksy, Tracey Emin, Grayson Perry and Damien Hirst are included on the list.

The youngest personality on the list is 17-year-old activist Malala Yousafzai, while the oldest is wildlife broadcaster Sir David Attenborough, aged 88.

There are 147 women on the list.

Joanne Milner, chief executive at Debrett's, said: "We are delighted to announce this year's Debrett's 500. It's a fascinating mix of people, and not entirely who you might expect.

'Every individual, though, demonstrates outstanding qualities of influence, achievement and inspiration. 

'I think now is the perfect time to consider how we can inspire the next generation of influencers, so that we can ensure that everyone, regardless of their background, has an equal opportunity to succeed.'

Seen as a guide for the upper classes, Debrett's has launched a foundation which aims to support social mobility in a bid to ensure that the next generation of leaders and influencers are from all backgrounds.
