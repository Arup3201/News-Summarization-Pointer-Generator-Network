A drunken airline passenger who ignored warnings from Boris Johnson to calm down on a flight from Malaysia has been jailed for six months. 

David Morris, 43, became abusive mid-flight following a drunken binge on lagers, whiskey and wine and headbutted a flight attendant. 

The Mayor of London was returning from a trade trip in the Far East when he tried to intervene and warned the drunkard he might have to be restrained if he did not settle down.

In a statement given to police on landing, Mr Johnson spoke of the fear in which the drunkard had put the passengers on the Malaysia Air flight.

Mr Johnson said: 'Myself and a few other passengers felt we needed to keep an eye on the male the whole time as we were worried about the safety of the crew and other passengers.

'I could tell people were stressed by the male's behaviour.'

Morris, 43, of Aldershot, in Hampshire, was arrested by police when the plane landed on December 3. 

The oil engineer had initially said he did not remember the incident. 

But at an earlier hearing at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, he admitted assault by beating and being drunk on an aircraft.

Mr Johnson told a court in a letter he was 'worried about the safety of the crew and other passengers

Prosecutor Pamela Reiss told Isleworth Crown Court how Morris had become increasingly agitated when he was denied further alcohol on the flight from Kuala Lumpur to London, pacing up and down the aisles and shouting abuse.

'Mr Morris' bad behaviour started around two hours into the flight,' she said.

'He was shouting and swearing foul language. There were a lot of f**** and a lot of c****.

'He was interrupting other passengers' peace. You could smell the alcohol on his breath.'

When startled staff tried to restrain the drunkard using plastic handcuffs, Morris became more violent, the court heard.

'He was becoming a danger to other passengers. His behaviour was out of control,' Ms Reiss said.

Flight attendant Johari Nordin was sitting opposite Morris and trying to put the plastic handcuffs on him when the drunkard headbutted him, leaving him with a swollen lip. 

'Myself and a few other passengers felt we needed to keep an eye on the male the whole time as we were worried about the safety of the crew and other passengers.

'I could tell people were stressed by the male's behaviour.'

But the court was told Morris was 'horrified' at his behaviour and has no recollection of the flight. 

Lance Whiteford, for the defence, said Morris had lost his job in the wake of the case and 'been punished enough'. 

Mr Whiteford told the judge: 'This case has attracted a huge amount of publicity because of the high-profile person who was in the first class cabin with him, and your Lordship will have seen the letter from him.

'As a result of his actions, his job in Malaysia was terminated.

'This man has been punished as a result of his actions.' 

'He has no recollection of his behaviour,' Mr Whiteford added. 'He was disgusted with his behaviour.

'He accepts the incident would have been terrifying for crew and passengers.

'This is no lager lout. This is someone who is mystified as to why he behaved in this atrocious way.'

The case was sent to Isleworth Crown Court for sentence, and a court official said Morris had received a total of six months' imprisonment.

Morris, dressed in a dark suit and light green shirt, broke down in tears as Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson told him his behaviour was 'far too serious' for a suspended jail term.

Referring to the claim that Morris was not a 'lager lout', Judge McGregor-Johnson said: 'You behaved in exactly the same way as one.

'It doesn't matter whether you come from the front or back of the plane, this court treats everyone equally.

'It's quite clear that you have expressed genuine remorse for your actions and have suffered the consequences with the loss of your job.

'Members of the aircraft crew are entitled to go about their jobs without being assaulted by passengers and a clear message has to go out.'
