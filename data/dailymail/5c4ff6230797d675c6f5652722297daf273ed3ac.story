Spiritual healer George Boak, 70, at an earlier healing at Bradford Crown Court. He denies two counts of sexual assault and one of indecent assault

A spiritual healer sexually assaulted women who went to him for pain relief, a court heard yesterday.

George Boak, 70, told patients his treatment worked by hovering his hands above their body and occasionally touching them.

One victim agreed to be naked after Boak claimed his healing methods would be more effective if she undressed.

But he allegedly groped her and kissed her breasts, before telling her: ‘Sorry, I got carried away.’

Boak – described as both a ‘spiritual’ and ‘faith’ healer – also put his hands under his clients’ clothing to touch them inappropriately, a jury at Bradford Crown Court was told.

He denies two counts of sexual assault and one of indecent assault involving three women. The offences allegedly took place over a ten-year period.

Michael Smith, prosecuting, said the women hoped Boak’s skills would help them, but instead he abused their trust and assaulted them.

‘He would sexually touch them when they went to him for treatment for chronic pain,’ he said.

The first victim hired the healer, who saw patients at his home in Halifax, West Yorkshire, to treat her severe back pain.

She lay on her front for the first hour, while he put his hands on her and moved along her body.

She then turned over on to her back and he did the same for the second hour, ‘avoiding the intimate areas’, as he worked.

The victim said the treatment worked at first, but she was disconcerted by Boak’s behaviour when he began to tell her she was ‘stunning’ and ‘beautiful’.

She felt uncomfortable and stopped visiting, only to return again last year due to chronic back pain.

‘On her last appointment she says the 
defendant put his hands down her T-shirt onto her breasts and pushed his
 groin against her,’ said Mr Smith. Boak is then alleged to have put 
his  hands down her leggings and under her underwear.

Then when she tried to get up, he kissed her on her stomach, Mr Smith told the court.

The woman went to police and Boak was arrested.

Boak told his clients that his treatments worked by hovering his hands above their body and occasionally touching them

Detectives seized his diaries, 
contacted other patients and found the second alleged victim who 
immediately told police she had been sexually assaulted by him in 2005.

She told officers she went to Boak with her husband and the couple were treated together.

‘In due course the defendant suggested the best way of her treatment would be for her to be naked,’ said Mr Smith.

‘Because her husband was present she agreed to receive the treatment naked from the defendant.’

The court heard he touched her private parts and breasts with the flat of his hand.

However, when she saw him later 
without her husband he  carried on touching her – and even kissed her 
breasts, it is claimed. She asked him: ‘George, what are you doing?’ and
 he replied: ‘Sorry, I got carried away’, the court was told. The woman 
didn’t go to police as she believed she had been ‘gullible’.

When questioned about the assault, 
Boak admitted the touching but claimed the woman said to him words to 
the effect of ‘give it to me, George’. He thought she was asking to be 
touched sexually, the court heard.

After Boak was charged and appeared in court, a third  complainant contacted police after reading about him in the local paper.

She told police he had put his hands 
down the front of her  trousers and groped her, but then continued on 
with the treatment as if nothing had happened. She went home, told her 
husband and never went back to him.

Addressing the jury, Judge Jonathan Rose said: ‘There is no suggestion that Mr Boak is a quack or a fake.’

The case continues.
