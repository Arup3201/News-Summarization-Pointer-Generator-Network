Gerard Pique let the cat out of the bag regarding Cesc Fabregas's transfer to Chelsea.

Pique had earlier spoken at a press conference, defending Fabregas.

He said: 'I love Cesc very much but he's going through a difficult situation.

'The club have never valued him as highly as they should have done. He would fit into any side.'

Pique told Del Bosque that he had supported Fabregas, to which the Spain manager replied: 'The president [of Barcelona, Josep Bartomeu] isn't going to be happy.

'You're going to drive him mad, poor guy. You're going to upset him.'

Pique replied: 'He [Cesc] told me it's all done. He's going. 33 million [euros] he told me.'

Although they did not state a location 
for Fabregas' transfer, Chelsea are believed to be the only English side
 close to sealing a deal for the former Arsenal star.

Fabregas was not first choice on Jose Mourinho's shopping list but the club are keen to bring him to Stamford Bridge.

Frank Lampard has left on a free transfer and the Blues need to strengthen their midfield.

Chelsea are lining up several transfers this window, with another La Liga star, Atletico Madrid's Diego Costa passing his medical on Wednesday afternoon.
