Hyundai has unveiled a new luxury sedan that is capable of outsmarting speed cameras.

Known as the Hyundai Genesis, the car will slow down automatically if it is being driven over the speed limit.

Its automatic braking technology combines with GPS locations of speed cameras to slow the car down if it detects it is in danger of getting a ticket - but only in range of a camera.

Hyundai's new luxury Genesis sedan, pictured, features smart technology that enables it to 'cheat' speed cameras. It uses GPS to locate speed cameras and then, after alerting the driver to the speed, slows the car down if it detects it is going too fast

The feature was announced by company spokesperson Guido Schenken in Seoul for the launch of the car.

If automatic braking isn't enough for you, then the Cruise RP-1 might be of interest.

It claims to be the world’s first ‘highway autopilot’ and can take control of car on a motorway, keeping it safely in lane and a suitable distance from the car in front.

The gadget, designed by Kyle Vogt, comprises a rooftop sensor unit, computer in the boot and control panel next to the driver.

The 'sensor pod' relays what it detects back to the ‘Cruise computer’ to make real-time decisions on where to position itself on the road.

It can be pre-ordered and is expected to be ready next year.

By comparison, Google has said that its automated self-driving cars will arrive between 2017 and 2020.

He said the vehicle is able to track the known locations of speed cameras on the road, although it is currently unable to keep track of mobile speed cameras.

The feature might prove to be controversial, though, with some drivers claiming speed cameras are not meant to be cheated, but rather are a safety measure for roads.

The car gives the driver a chance to slow down before applying the brakes itself.

As it approaches a camera, the Genesis will beep at a distance of 2,600ft (800 metres) to let the driver know the legal speed, reported Drive.

Another beep will sound if the speed is over that before the automatic braking system kicks in and slows the car down to the correct speed as it passes through the eyes of the camera.

The speed-camera avoidance system is likely to prove controversial with road safety groups, as it may advocate driving fast before and after a camera. Therefore negating the point of having speed cameras in the first place

It can also be used for average speed cameras found on motorways, keeping the car at the correct speed through a region.

The car will no doubt be useful for people exploring a new location where they are unaware of the location of local speed cameras.

But it’s unlikely to prove popular with people campaigning for increasing car safety on the roads.

This speed camera feature will not be available on the first models of the Genesis, which is available from October 2014, but will be released eventually.

The Genesis will also come with a number of other features. These include a blind spot detection system to check for cars, a lane departure warning assistance that keeps the car on the road and emergency braking if an upcoming hazard is detected.

The Genesis car features a number of smart driving features. The Automatic Emergency Braking system uses cameras and radar sensors to detect if a crash is imminent and, if so, can rapidly stop the car. The Heads-Up Display above the dashboard (pictured), meanwhile, displays directional data
