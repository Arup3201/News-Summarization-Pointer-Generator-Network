Medieval men dug them to harvest medicinal salt, but today Romania’s Turda salt mine complex has been turned into a theme park, with the help of some ingenious engineering.

The deepest mine is 393 ft (120 metres) below ground and while labourers previously chipped away at the salt before pulling it to the surface, now people can enjoy a ride on a ferris wheel or play mini golf, in the most spectacular surroundings.

Experts claim that microclimate also offers health benefits especially for people with respiratory difficulties and has a constant temperature of around 12°C.

While it is possible that the mines near the city of Turda were first dug during Roman occupation, it is thought that they were founded shortly before 1075 after engineers stumbled across evidence of medieval tunnels in 1876.

The first official document that mentions their existence was written by the Hungarian chancellery in 1271 and the mines’ success grew from there.

In the early years, a ‘staircase of the rich people’ provided access to the mines' depths to observe the workers. To fix each step in place, labourers had to cut parallel slots in the wall. Later, three wells were used to extract the salt and were expanded in the 19th century when table salt was still very much in demand.

An octagonal room houses a winch called the crivac which was driven by horses to pull salt from the Rudolf mine to the surface. It is the only one of its kind in Europe.

Over the years the mine has had many uses. Between 1948 and 1992 the Franz Josef Gallery was used to store cheese. Now it is a large recreational complex.

At 137 ft (42 metres) deep, 196 ft (50 metres) wide and 262 ft (80 metres) long, Rudolf Mine (pictured) is home to miniature golf, bowling lanes, an 180-seat amphitheatre and playground, as well as fairground rides such as a carousel and big wheel

At 137 ft (42 metres) deep, 196 ft (50 metres) wide and 262 ft (80 metres) long, Rudolf Mine is home to miniature golf, bowling lanes, an 180-seat amphitheatre and playground, as well as fairground rides such as a carousel and big wheel.

It is accessible from in impressive lift and visitors can take in the array of stalactites dangling from the ceiling, which grow at rate of one inch (2 cm) every year, before they typically drop off when they reach of length of around nine ft (three metres).

The cone-shaped Terezia mine is even deeper at around 393 ft (120 metres) and it too is decorated with a bloom of stalactites. Its focus is a shallow lake of salty water, up to 26 ft (eight metres) deep, which is peppered with rowing boats.

There is an island in the centre, which was originally a heap of ‘waste’ salt that was never moved once the mine was shut down in 1880.

Above the surface, salt baths are taken as a health treatment, but the mine itself also offers respiratory benefits, according to the attraction’s website.

These benefits include a constant air temperature of 12°C and humidity between 73 to 80 per cent, which is believed to help respiratory problems.

There are said to be ‘virtually zero’ allergens in the mines as well as pathogenic yeasts or fungi and Romanian health workers claim it is good for asthma and bronchitis.

The mine complex’s website claims: ‘Exposure to salt mine microclimate has beneficial effects on the airways of people with occupational risk factors, or environmental - emissions, gas, tobacco, etc - thereby reducing morbidity.’

The mines are located in the protected area of Durgau-Salt Valley where there are salt baths. People first took to the spa in 1840, but the Lakes of Durgau were well known in Roman times and were used for bathing and therapy.

The waters halve a high salt content – 10 percent at the surface and up to 28 per cent at depths of 98 ft (30 metres).

They are gradually being turned into a complex used to treat rheumatic diseases, circulatory and gynaecological issues and tourists flock to them during the summer months.
