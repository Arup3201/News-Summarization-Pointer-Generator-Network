‘Hoylake, blown upon by mighty winds, breeder of mighty champions,’ wrote the legendary golf writer Bernard Darwin, who happened to be the grandson of Charles Darwin.

And he was right - the evolution of Open winners at this venue is easy to trace: to lift the Claret Jug here you must be a true links great.

From J.H. Taylor to Bobby Jones, Peter Thomson and the greatest of them all, Tiger Woods, Hoylake does indeed breed mighty champions.

So look no further than golf’s big beasts in the field this week.

That doesn’t mean to say that having a major championship already in the bag is a must for the eventual winner this week - it sure helps, but this is a course where legends can be made.

One man who has already claimed a spot among the game’s pantheon is Tiger Woods. The 14-time major champion returns to the scene of his most emotional triumph, having won here just two months after the death of his father in 2006.

Woods is bullish and claims only victory here will do – he won a US Open on a broken leg after all - but in his second tournament after major back surgery, surely this is a step to far for even a superman like Woods. Still, 22-1 is the most tempting price of all this week. Resist if you dare…

Woods showed how to conquer Hoylake in 2006 – avoid the fairway bunkers at all costs and putt like a demon.

In with a shout: 14-time major champion Tiger Woods claims only victory in the Open will do

Memories: Woods won in Liverpool just two months after the death of his father in 2006

Those taking the bold approach off the tee could be punished by Darwin’s mighty winds and find themselves caught in the traps or in the thick rough found at every Open venue. The greens here are large for a links and fairly flat – a dead-eyed putter could clean up.

That is why defending champion Phil Mickelson (25-1), who has not putted well since his crowning glory at Muirfield last summer, and world No 1 Adam Scott (14-1) could fall just short. Scott looks focused and ready to add to his Masters victory last year, but the flat stick remains his one weakness.

Of the favourites, Henrik Stenson looks the best bet. The hulking Swede also has a slight weakness in his putting but is the best ballstriker in the world right now.

It surely is only a matter of time before he wins his first major. Stenson’s Open record is mightily impressive after three top three finishes in his last five appearances, including a near miss at Muirfield last year.

Given that he destroyed the field in the last major contested in one of the game’s all-time great performances, Martin Kaymer is outstanding value at 25-1.

The German has two majors under his belt and showed at Pinehurst last month that his is the coolest putting stroke out there from any distance. Kaymer also won the previous big event he entered, the Players Championship in May, so is the game’s in-form player along with Justin Rose.

Rose (14-1) has claimed the Quicken Loans Invitational and Scottish Open titles in successive weeks on either side of the pond.

The Englishman’s win in Aberdeen was his first on a links course since bursting on to the scene with a fourth at Birkdale as a teenager in 1998, too.

THREE TO WIN

Adam Scott (AUS) — 14/1Blew good chances to win in 2012 and 2013 but surely destined to hold the Claret Jug one day. Those watching him in practice believe this could be his time.

Henrik Stenson (SWE) — 14/1It was this time last year that the personable Swede went on his all-conquering run. Fearless under pressure and likes the course.

Graeme McDowell (NI) — 28/1First-round leader the last time The Open was at Hoylake and has all the tools to be leading after 72 holes.

THREE FOR E/W (FINISH IN TOP FIVE)

Mikko Ilonen (FIN) — 12/1May be the most underrated player on the European Tour. Won Amateur Championship at Hoylake in 2000.

Shane Lowry (IRE) — 20/1The eyes of good putters tend to light up when they see the smooth greens at Royal Liverpool. Lowry can putt with the best of them.

Jordan SpietH (US) — 10/1Given how many top 10s the 20-year-old  compiles, he has to represent decent value. The Texan should prosper on these putting surfaces.

But surely three wins on the bounce is 
too much for anyone other than Woods in his prime, so the Hampshire man 
may have peaked just a little too soon. Kaymer’s form, however, is too 
good to ignore.

It was also difficult to look past Jordan Spieth’s assertion that he could one day break Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18 major championships, despite the fact that the 20-year-old Texan has yet to win a single one of golf’s four big tournaments.

But this kid is special, as he showed is so nearly becoming the youngest ever Masters champion in April. He also has good links experience from his days as a junior, can hit the ball low under the wind and has a magic short game. At 33-1, Spieth is one to watch.

Another man impossible to ignore is Rory McIlroy. If everything clicks, the Northern Irishman could blow away the field like one of the gales that often howl in here from the Wirral Estuary.

But if the wind does pick up, there are huge question marks over McIlroy’s game. His bizarre Friday funks also mean McIlroy’s form is too erratic to risk a price of 16-1.

One man heading under the radar this week is Ian Poulter (80-1). His Open form is heading in exactly the right direction after top 10s in the last two years, including a dramatic late charge at Muirfield last summer. 

As Ryder Cups have proven, there is no 
better putter under pressure than Poulter.

He has been worried by a 
painful wrist this week, but remember the old adage: beware the injured 
golfer.

Under the radar: Ian Poulter's Open form is heading in the right direction after top 10s in the last two years

The only thing hurting Graeme McDowell (25-1) recently is his failure to add to his US Open title from Pebble Beach in 2010. The 34-year-old grew up on links golf in Portrush and came very close to the Claret Jug two summers ago just up the road from here at Royal Lytham.

A springtime break and his recent marriage have left McDowell happy with life and he looks to be approaching his prime as a golfer. Oh, and he’s also deadly on the greens.

Any of these men would be a worthy successor to Woods as champion at Hoylake. Oh, and what price was Tiger, again?
