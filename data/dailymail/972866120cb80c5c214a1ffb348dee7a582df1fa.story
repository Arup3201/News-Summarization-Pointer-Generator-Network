A former Indiana state trooper who has maintained his innocence over the killing of his wife and two young children for 13 years was finally been cleared of their murder today.

Jurors cleared David Camm over the deaths of 35-year-old Kimberly and their children, Brad, 7, and Jill, 5, who were shot dead in September 2000.

As the verdict was read, Mr Camm thanked the jury, who had been selected from a town 100 miles away from where the crimes took place to ensure impartiality.

Mr Camm had discovered his family's bodies after they were shot dead in the garage of their Georgetown home.

They were killed about four months after Mr Camm had resigned from the Indiana State Police force to take a job with his uncle.

The 49-year-old has said previously that he was playing basketball at a church at the time of the murders, but juries had convicted him twice before.

Both convictions were overturned on appeal because of issues with evidence.

'This is vindication,' defense attorney RIchard Kammen said.

Mr Camm's father, Donald, was jubilant after the verdict as he spoke outside the courthouse with his daughter, Julie Blankenbaker and defense attorneys.

'I don't have the words. I'm very happy,' he said.

The third trial was moved about 100 miles north of the crime scene to the central Indiana community of Lebanon to find an impartial jury.

'The verdict is pretty clear,' Special Prosecutor Stan Levco said.

Much of the testimony during the eight-week trial focused on blood spatter evidence and Mr Camm's whereabouts at the time of the slayings.

Prosecutor Todd Meyer challenged the father's alibi, saying other basketball players couldn't say definitively that Mr Camm never left the church gymnasium on the night of the killings.

Mr Levco said in opening statements that Mr Camm had wanted to end his marriage and stood to benefit from insurance proceeds.

Mr Kammen did not call the defendant to the stand, saying he believed significant questions had been raised about evidence presented against Mr Camm, and that there was no need for him to testify.

Mr Camm's attorneys have blamed a second man, Charles Boney, for the killings. Boney, whose sweatshirt and DNA was found at the crime scene, is serving a 225-year sentence for murder and conspiracy.

He had testified that he visited the Camm home on the day of the shootings and sold Mr Camm the gun that was used.

He testified he was outside when the shootings occurred and that Mr Camm also tried to shoot him but the gun misfired.

The murders were one of Indiana’s 
longest-running cases, following a tangled legal path riddled 
with missing murder weapons, allegations of affairs and child abuse, the
emergence of a second suspect and a prosecutor’s removal over a book 
deal.

Jury selection for the third trial began in August and the trial was moved to Boone County in 
hopes that an impartial jury could be found.

For Frank and Janice Renn, Kimberly Camm's parents, the trial was another chance to get closure.

'It’s like that movie Groundhog Day, where he keeps waking up to the same thing every day,’ Mr Renn said.

After DNA 
linked a violent ex-convict to the scene in the first trial, most believed Mr Camm would be 
freed. Instead, prosecutors said he had conspired with the second man 
to kill his family, and he was convicted again in 2006.

Boney’s palm print was found on Kimberly Camm’s SUV, and a sweatshirt found in the garage had been issued to Boney in prison while he was serving time for armed robbery and criminal confinement.

Both times, appellate courts ruled 
that prosecutors had deliberately inflamed the jury, in the first trial 
by calling a dozen women who testified they had extramarital affairs 
with Camm, and in the second by suggesting he had molested his daughter 
without any evidence to back up those statements.

September 28, 2000, was like most 
days in the Camm household. After work, Mrs Camm drove her children to sports clubs before setting off for home at about 7pm.

Mr Camm had left work just before 7pm and drove to a nearby church, where
he arranged to play a pickup game of basketball with a group of 
friends. 

Costly: It is estimated that the three trials of David Camm will have cost the state $4 million

Just before 9.30pm, he placed a frantic call with the ISP Sellersburg, where he had worked for 10 years, reporting that he found his wife and children shot dead in the garage of their home.

The prosecution, however, rejected David Camm’s version of events, accusing him of murdering his family in order to pursue affairs with other women. 

During his first trial, the 11 people who took part in the basketball pickup game on the night of September 28 testified in Mr Camm's defense, telling jurors that he was at the gym at the time of the murders.

The three trials have cost Floyd County, 
where the murders took place, more than $4 million and have forced 
officials to eliminate raises for most county employees and repair 
bridges and roads only in emergencies.
