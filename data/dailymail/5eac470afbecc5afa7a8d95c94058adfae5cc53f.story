Tough times: Simon Cowell suffered a breakdown as he collapsed under pressure, earlier this summer

Simon Cowell collapsed from nervous exhaustion this summer after his workaholic lifestyle got the better of him, it emerged yesterday.

The star was bedridden for weeks after doctors told him to rest, according to an updated biography.

It claims the 52-year-old admitted he was ‘paralysed with tiredness’ and his ‘immune system was failing’ because of his job.

But with The X Factor continuing to flop in the UK, and scheduling clashes dogging the US version, it seems there will be no respite in the near future.

In an updated version of his book Sweet Revenge: The Intimate Life Of Simon Cowell, biographer Tom Bower claims that the star had to halt filming of the US show as he began acting like a ‘weird vampire’, working through the night.

Doctors warned him to give up smoking, stop taking health supplements and give his body a break.

Cowell is claimed to have confided in X Factor judge Louis Walsh: ‘I desperately need peace. I’m craving normality. I’ve got to work out my demons and come out of it.

‘I have to get back to where I was  years ago. I have to stop reading texts at three in the morning and making calls later and later.’

He also told friends that running two high-profile shows in the UK and America had left him at breaking point.

His enforced spell of rest meant he missed key promotional time with The X Factor’s new US line-up, which includes Britney Spears.

But Cowell revealed he was told to take a rest because his life had ‘become like a night shift’, adding: ‘I had forgotten the sensation of the morning.’

His company Syco Productions officially stated that he had come down with bronchitis. It is understood he took a three-week break from work to recuperate fully.

The revelations come as ratings in  Britain for Saturday night’s episode of  The X Factor dropped to a series low of 7.7million, with viewers apparently put off by the decision to show fewer performances and more ‘behind-the-scenes’ shots.

The ratings will be a blow to Cowell as they are some way below the average of more than 10million for the 2010 series.

He will be hoping that the surprise reappearance of Cheryl Cole will provide a boost.

The singer left her role as a judge for an ill-fated stint doing the same on the US version of the show, falling out with Cowell after she was axed within days.

But she has returned to assist Gary Barlow as a guest mentor for the ‘judges’ houses’ stage of the singing competition, which will be screened later in the series.

However, it seems that her feud with Cowell is not over.

After he sent her a Twitter message to say ‘Welcome back’, the singer said: ‘I saw Simon’s tweet. I’m not doing this for him. I am doing this for Gary as he’s my friend and he asked me to do it.’

Meanwhile, the US version of The X Factor is facing increased competition.

Last week Cowell reacted angrily to news that a rival talent show, the US version of The Voice, will be screened at the same time as The X Factor returns there for a second series.

He said: ‘It is a spoiling tactic and it’s very simple – [The Voice broadcaster NBC doesn’t] want people to see this first episode… I think it’s mean-spirited and I hope and I pray that it backfires on them because this is one of the best shows we’ve ever made.’
