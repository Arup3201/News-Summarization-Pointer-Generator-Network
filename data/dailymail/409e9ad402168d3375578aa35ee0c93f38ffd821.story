The ATP has announced an increase in prize money which will see it breach the $100million (£63.6million) barrier for the first time in the 2015 season.

The biggest changes come at the top level with a prize money increase totalling 14 per cent at ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournaments, and a smaller three per cent increase at ATP World Tour 250 level.

The ATP said increases will take effect over the next four years and will see overall prize money reach $135million (£85.9million) by 2018.
