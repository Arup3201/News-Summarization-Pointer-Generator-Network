It's not often this is said, but Manchester City could really have done with an extra dimension on Saturday.

Beaten by the odd goal - a stunning Mame Biram Diouf solo effort, in fact - against Stoke City, Manuel Pellegrini's side lacked ideas.

They were uncharacteristically without the means necessary to break down what was a masterclass in defensive organisation and ultimately fluid counter attacking football.

Ruthless: Manchester City could do with someone of Radamel Falcao's talent, despite their attacking prowess

The brilliance of Diouf's storming run and finish from deep in his own half masked what was an unusually insipid display by City.

Stevan Jovetic and Sergio Aguero showed signs that their partnership could prove fruitful, with Edin Dzeko normally an important impact player, but the Premier League champions were nowhere near their best. 'A bad day,' was Pellegrini's assessment.

And all the while there was a certain Colombian who appeared to be saying his goodbyes at Monaco.

Radamel Falcao looks all set to leave Ligue 1 on loan for the remainder of the season - talk intensified by his mysterious omission from Monaco's game on Saturday afternoon. He was pictured sat with agent Jorge Mendes in the stands and is attracting interest throughout Europe.

But while City were originally in the hunt for Falcao's services, Real Madrid are now on the brink of securing the hitman to add to their attacking delights. 

There aren't many strikers of Falcao's quality and ruthlessness about and the swell of feeling that City could be ready to swoop was only heightened when Pellegrini refused to rule out a move. 'We have 48 hours (until the transfer window shuts,' he said. 'We will see.'

What the Chilean definitely witnessed was a side struggling with plan B against Stoke.

The away central defenders Ryan Shawcross and Marc Wilson dealt with the movement in front comfortably, and when City did knock the ball long the words meat and drink sprang to mind.

Despondent: Pellegrini may live to rue not being able to pick up Falcao on a season-long loan

Can't believe it: But only Edin Dzeko offers a chance of tact for Manchester City's striking options

Dzeko is the striker to offer a real change in tact - meaning they can go back to front a bit more directly - but, for all his undoubted quality, isn't powerful enough in the air.

Falcao on the other hand has it all.

Quick, athletic and a man who enjoys aerial battles, he is someone who would present a different challenge to defenders both domestically and in Europe.

With a superb goalscoring record, Falcao's move to Real Madrid may be a moment City live to rue.

When more teams sit deep and frustrate at the Etihad Stadium, they will be crying out for someone of the Colombian's ruthless goalscoring prowess.
