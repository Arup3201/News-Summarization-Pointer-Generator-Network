A photographer captured a pair of unidentified objects apparently hovering near the flight path of a passenger jet as he took pictures of huge storm clouds gathering over Bondi Beach.

Photographer Dan Toomey snapped photos of the two objects flying either side of a Virgin passenger jet while taking photos of angry skies off Sydney's coast

Mr Toomey believes they are unidentified flying objects or UFOs.

Dan Toomey snapped photos of these unidentified flying objects in the sky over Bondi during a storm five years ago

'When I was taking photos I saw nothing unusual other than a new storm,' he said.

'I uploaded the photos only minutes later on my laptop and I zoomed in and said "What is this"?'

In the series of photographs, taken in 2009, a saucer-like and cigar-shaped object are seen flying either side of a Virgin Blue plane.

Over the next few days, Mr Toomey tried to find out what the objects were, but was unsuccessful.

'I tried to experiment to determine whether or not any insects or birds could have produced similar results, which is impossible – I’ve consulted with other photographers,' he said.

This photo is part of a series of about nine photos taken consecutively showing two objects flying near a Virgin Blue passenger plane

'The photographs are authentic and they are objects that cannot be claimed.

'If you invert the photo to a negative, the plane appears white as a solid object and so do the other objects.'

But this is not the first time Mr Toomey has spotted an unexplained object.

He said he had seen them with his own eyes but had rarely captured them on film.

'It always pays to have a camera handy,' the 38-year-old said.

Even though the photos were taken in 2009, Mr Toomey has been holding them close to his chest.

In this negative image, the two objects (left and right) appear in white on either side of the plane (centre) indicating they are solid

But with the unexplained disappearance of the Malaysian Airlines flight, he felt it was time to share them.

'There’s a big a question mark next to that plane and a lot of conspiracies surrounding what happened,' Mr Toomey said.

'Maybe it’s the right time for the world to know and that these things are real.'

Flight MH370 was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it went missing on March 8.

The search for the plane continues off the coast of Australia in the southern Indian Ocean.
