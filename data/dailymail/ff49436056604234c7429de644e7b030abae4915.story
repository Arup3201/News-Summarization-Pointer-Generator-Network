Attack: Iain Duncan Smith was criticised for suggesting welfare cuts encouraged businesses

The burden of high taxes and red tape is preventing Britain from creating enough globally successful entrepreneurs, according to a think-tank.

Analysis by the Centre for Policy Studies found the UK does not even rank among the top 10 countries for producing billionaire entrepreneurs.

Britain lags behind the likes of Hong Kong, the U.S., Australia, Canada and Ireland according to the study - although still performed better than the majority of eurozone countries, including Germany.

In an article for The Daily Telegraph, the report's author Dr Nima Sanandaji urged the Government to cut capital gains tax and scrap the top 45p tax rate.

He also criticised Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith for suggesting the Coalition's welfare reforms were encouraging more people to start successful businesses.

Last week Mr Duncan Smith hailed Britain's 'entrepreneurial spirit' after the Bank of England highlighted figures showing a record 4.5 million people are self-employed.

But Dr Sanandaji wrote: 'The Work and Pensions Secretary was conflating self-employment with entrepreneurship. In reality, the two phenomena are quite different.'

'The Coalition's benefit reforms may well promote self-employment, which is a good thing in itself. But it is wrong to suppose that reducing benefits will do much for entrepreneurship.

'In order to do that, the Coalition should turn its attention to cutting business and personal tax rates and taking the axe to red tape.'

Success stories:  There were a total of 22 British billionaire entrepreneurs between 1996 and 2010, including retail tycoon Sir Philip Green (left) and Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson (right)

Dr Sanandaji analysed nearly 1,000 self-made men and women who, according to business magazine Forbes, have earned at least one billion dollars.

There were a total of 22 British billionaire entrepreneurs between 1996 and 2010, including retail tycoon Sir Philip Green and Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson.

According to the analysis, Britain produced one entrepreneur billionaire for every two million people.

By contrast Hong Kong produced almost three mega-rich entrepreneurs for every million, Israel 1.7 per million and the US 1.3 per million.

However, the study suggested Britain was still better than most eurozone countries when it came to producing successful entrepreneurs - beating Germany, Spain, France and Italy.
