Taylor proposed to his musical girlfriend on Valentine's day this year. Presenting her with a large heart shaped diamond ring. 

The couple first met in 2011 when he starred in her video for her hit song, You and I. 

28-year-old Gaga, whose real name is Stefani, has previously professed her desire to have children. In an interview with Oprah in 2012 she said: 'Yes, I want kids, I want a soccer team.'

She has previously spoken out about how supportive Taylor, 33, is of her and her career. She told The Times last year: 'He's supportive of everything I do. 

'He loves me from the inside out, and he is completely blind to the way that I dress, my creative process as it is. He knows me as the Italian-American girl my mother and father gave birth to.' 

She said of having children with the actor: 'To be honest, having my own kids will be like having three little monsters with me all the time. They probably won't be fans. They'll probably like hate my music who knows.'

'I want to live a family life. I grew up with a very strong family and I just cannot imagine not having a normal nuclear family.'
