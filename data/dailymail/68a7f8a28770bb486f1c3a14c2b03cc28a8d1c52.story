Two young children have been left orphaned after their father died in his sleep in the same bed where their mother had succumbed to cancer just two months before.

Stephen Furbush, 39, passed away following a suspected heart attack at his home in Canton, Massachusetts on Sunday, leaving his children, Kayley, six, and Patrick, three, with no parents.

His wife Kristen had died in November after a six-month battle with brain cancer.

'The kids were almost getting back
 to some kind of normalcy,' Kristen’s father, John O'Keefe told the Patriot Ledger. 'And 
then bang, this happened. It's crazy. I don't know why.'

Mr O'Keefe and his wife, who are 64 and 62 and both work, are now looking after Kayley and Patrick at the children's home, while numerous cousins, uncles and aunts rally around them.

Stephen's brother said three-year-old Patrick doesn't really understand the deaths, but that little Kayley immediately broke down on hearing about her father.

'She immediately grasped onto the nearest family member and started sobbing,' he said.

'She just went through this two months ago with her mother, and we explained to her, "Kayley, you have two angels now looking down on you".'

Stephen had spent Saturday night at home watching the football game with friends. One stayed overnight and made the heartbreaking discovery on Sunday morning.

Broken heart syndrome, which is also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or takotsubo cardiomyopathy, can strike even healthy people, according to the American Heart Association. It is caused by a stressful situation, from suffering a break-up or death.

It may be misdiagnosed as a heart attack because the symptoms and test results are similar;  1 to 2 per cent of people diagnosed with a heart attack are really suffering from the broken heart syndrome.

Tests show changes in rhythm and blood substances that are typical of a heart attack, but unlike in a heart attack, there's no evidence of blocked heart arteries.

In the condition, part of the heart temporarily enlarges and doesn’t pump well. It can cause severe, short-term heart muscle failure, but it is rarely fatal. It is usually treatable and sufferers can make a full recovery within weeks.

Authorities said the death is not suspicious and the Boston Herald reported that the cause was a heart attack.

This time last year, the couple was enjoying bringing up their young children after seven years of marriage and four years living in Canton.

But last May, Kristen started to suffer from blurred vision and headaches.

An MRI scan found a tumor pressing on an optic nerve and Kristen began radiation and chemotherapy - but her condition worsened quickly.

On a website set up to share details of her care, Stephen wrote on November 8: 'The cancer is moving faster than the medical science.'

She returned home and passed away on November 11.

'She just wanted to come home and get her 
loving arms around her two beautiful children whom she loved more than 
any mother ever has,' Stephen wrote. 'She said all her 
goodbyes, made her peace and set her soul free.'

Stephen's relatives said he had been tremendous with his children following the death of his wife.

He had completed his first week back at Wellesley Bank, where he processed mortgages, and bought workout gear in the hopes of losing some weight.

Now the family is raising money for the children's care online - more than $83,000 so far - and through events as they wonder where to go from here.

'You’ve gotta do what you’ve gotta do,' said Mr O'Keefe.  'Between the bunch of us, we'll get it done.'
