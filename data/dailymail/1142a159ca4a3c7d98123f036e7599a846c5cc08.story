A raft of 'bizarre'  Victorian-style by-laws banning activities such as selling lucky heather have been introduced by councils

Driving into a retail park after 6pm is now a crime under a raft of 'bizarre' new Victorian-style by-laws introduced by councils.

Playing music, skateboarding, drinking alcohol in public and even selling lucky heather are among the activities outlawed by local authorities across the country in a drive to restrict freedom, say critics.

A group which campaigns against excessive regulation said the measures introduced in the 2014 Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act had created a 'patchwork of criminal law'.

Under Public Spaces Protection Orders (PSPOs), an activity that is illegal in one street may not be in the next – creating confusion, the Manifesto Club has claimed.

But councils say the orders, which allow them to target anti-social behaviour at a local level, have widespread public support.

The orders, a form of Asbo, were first used in December when council chiefs made it a crime for motorists to enter a retail park between 6pm and 6am unless they were using shops or restaurants.

The aim was to ban up to 500 boy racers who used the Turner Rise Retail Park in Colchester as a meeting place. 

Ministers insist the orders are intended to clamp down on anti-social behaviour, such as spitting and aggressive begging.

But some councils are also planning to apply them to the likes of pigeon feeding, 'nuisance parking' and children playing ball games outside schools. 

Town Hall chiefs in Blackpool want to ban loitering around cash machines and the sale of lucky charms and heather.

In Oxford it is now a crime to enter a tower block if you are under the age of 21 unless you live there or are visiting a resident. Council bosses are also trying to ban pigeon feeding and taking your dog off their lead.

Playing music, skateboarding and drinking alcohol in public  are among the activities outlawed

Anybody flouting the orders will be liable for a fine, normally ranging from £70 to £100, issued by a police officer, police community support officer, council worker or private security guard employed by the local Town Hall. A Home Office spokesman said: 'Public Spaces Protection Orders ensure that public spaces are not affected by anti-social behaviour so law-abiding people can enjoy them.'

But Josie Appleton, director of the Manifesto Club, said: 'These powers are so broad that they allow councils to ban pretty much anything.

'The result is a patchwork of criminal law where something is illegal in one street but not the next. This makes it hard for the public to know what is criminal and what is not.

'These orders will turn towns into no-go zones for homeless people, old ladies feeding pigeons, or anyone else the council views as 'messy' – a return to the meddling and moralism of 19th-century by-laws.'

People caught urinating in the streets will have to clean up the mess themselves as part of a groundbreaking new scheme.

Instead of being given a fine and facing a court case, offenders will be given the chance to wash the street clean of urine.

The plan, which was introduced in December in Eastleigh, Hampshire, is believed to be the first of its kind in the country and has been welcomed by traders.

Under the scheme, those responsible can meet with a representative of the town's businesses who explains what it is like to clear up after someone.

They also spend several hours cleaning the streets – and avoid a fine of up to £400. One young man who took part in the initiative said: 'I'm ashamed of what I did. I hadn't realised how many people are affected.'
