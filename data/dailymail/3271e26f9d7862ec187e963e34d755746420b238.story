It's far from the glamour tie Liverpool fans would have dreamed of upon the club's return to Champions League football as Brendan Rodgers' side take on Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets on Tuesday night.

The Bulgarian champions earned their place in this season's top European competition thanks to a dramatic Champions League play-off win against Steaua Bucharest in August.

Here, Sportsmail tells you all you need to know about the 13-year-old club about to make their Champions League debut.

The Romanian defender stepped in to help Ludogorets qualify for the Champions League group stages 

Who are they?

Their name is PFC Ludogorets Razgrad, to be precise, and they will be just the second Bulgarian team to make an appearance in Europe's elite competition - the other being Levski Sofia in the 2006-07 season, and they didn't gain a single point.

That means, Ludogorets, which translates to 'The Wild Forest', only need to record one draw against Liverpool, Real Madrid or Basle to better their compatriots.

Founded in 2001, the Razgrad club are just 13 years old. To put that in even starker context ahead of Tuesday, Steven Gerrard had already been playing in Liverpool's first team for three years.

Their ground in Razgrad only holds 8,000 people and they will have to play their Champions League matches in the capital Sofia.

Some teams have a bloke in a costume as their mascot, Ludogorets, known as The Eagles, have the real deal. After beating Lazio in Rome in February, the Italians were so impressed they gave their opponents a live eagle. Fans named it Fortuna, but they may have missed a sponsorship opportunity — one of the other names suggested was Nike. 

How did they get to the Champions League group stage? 

Promoted to the Bulgarian First Division in 2011, Ludogorets have managed to make history by winning three successive titles, largely thanks to the investments of businessman Kiril Domuschiev.

Ludogorets' summer campaign to claim a place in this season's Champions League group stages caught the neutrals' eye after a dramatic penalty shootout win against Steaua Bucharest in August.

As the tie was forced into extra-time, Romanian defender Cosmin Moti came to his side's rescue following the 119th minute dismissal of goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov.

Moti, forced to wear the shirt of substitute keeper Ivan Cvorovic, was the hero of the night, scoring the first penalty for his side before making brilliant diving saves to deny Paul Pirvulescu and Cornel Rapa as Ludogorets won the shootout 6-5 to spark wild scenes.

The club’s ground seats only 6,000 people and does not meet UEFA requirements, so their home games will be played 200 miles away in Sofia.

Domuschiev has plans to build a new stadium for the club and one of the stands will be named after Moti.

One to watch 

Brazilian forward Marcelinho has the creativity to cause Liverpool problems if he's given too much time on the ball.

And with Rodgers claiming 'we have to defend better,' following Liverpool's 1-0 Premier League defeat against Aston Villa on Saturday, Marcelinho will be hoping to find the gaps between Liverpool's midfield and defence.

Who will be kicking Mario Balotelli into Row Z? 

As long as he doesn't have to make another memorable cameo appearance in goal, Moti will be the one to let Super Mario know he's in a game. 

Ludogorets captain Svetoslav Dyakov will try and fill holes, but he may be pre-occupied with the forward running if Liverpool's man of the moment Raheem Sterling.

How will they line-up?

Georgi Dermendzhiev's side are likely to line-up in a 4-2-3-1 formation with their 2014 Europa League talisman, Slovenian striker Roman Bezjak, leading the line.

Tuesday night's away side will try and settle into their own half and wait for chances on the counter-attack to make the most of their pacey wingers.

Should Liverpool break down Ludogorets' defence, you'd expect Balotelli and Co to end up on top as the Bulgarians have a habit of conceding late on.

Season so far

The Bulgarian champions haven't had the best of starts to their 2014-15 domestic campaign.

Ludogorets have won just 15 points from eight games but that's enough to keep them in fourth, just two points off the pace behind CSKA Sofia.
