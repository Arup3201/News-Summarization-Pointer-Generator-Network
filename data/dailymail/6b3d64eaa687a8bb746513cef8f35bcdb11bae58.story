A 15-year-old schoolgirl has been found safe and well by police after disappearing with a man twice her age.

Rebecca McLean was last seen with Michael Britten in Ryde on the Isle of Wight on Saturday after travelling to the holiday island by ferry.

The 33-year-old chef has been arrested on suspicion of child abduction.

A
 spokesman for Hampshire Police said: 'We can confirm that missing 
teenager Rebecca McLean, aged 15 years, from Southampton, has been found
 safe and well.

'Rebecca was located on the Isle of Wight. A 33-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of child abduction.'

It is thought the pair, who are both from Southampton, met while Britten was lodging at the home of one of Rebecca’s family friends, Michele Allen.

The teenager had been living at the flat for a few weeks when social services decided to move her to new accommodation several weeks ago.

She was last seen by her family on Saturday morning before taking a ferry to the Isle of Wight with Britten, it is thought.

Ms Allen said she knew the pair had run away when she went into Britten’s bedroom at the weekend and found all of his things were gone. 

‘I first realised they had gone when I went into his room to ask for him to pay his rent for the month, which is £50 a week.

‘He would go to Tesco's to withdraw money to pay me but I need someone to live here because I cannot pay the bills on my own.

'I went in to get the money from him but all their stuff was gone from the room and I realised they had done a runner.

‘At first I phoned the police and then the social worker rang me up - she said “she's on the run with Michael”’

‘I couldn't believe what they had done - it's so wrong and it's affected everyone close to them.

‘I told them it was wrong but they would deny anything was happening between them.’

Ms Allen, 51, added Britten had been quiet before Rebecca moved in but became more sociable. 

‘She would spend her days living in the flat talking to Michael - they were always together.

‘He worked as a chef at Yates's bar in the town centre and moved in here about three months ago - he knew a friend of my son's.

‘There was nothing at all between them when Rebecca first moved in until about a week later.

‘I wasn't very happy about it and this is what I told the social worker - she had come up to our flat to try and take her back to her mum's for the time being.

‘I think when they realised Rebecca would have to move out they decided to run off together.’

‘Before she moved in he never spoke to me and would just be in his room saying nothing. He liked his computer games and had a TV for it in his room.

‘We had an argument once and I told him “I took you in when you had nowhere to go” - and from then on he started being nice.

Rebecca’s mother, Julie Middleditch, said she was relieved her daughter had been found safe after making an emotional plea for her to come home at the weekend. 

‘I'm really happy she has been found - we were so worried because she was away from home.

‘We wanted her back as soon as possible and it is a big relief,’ she said.
