A college football star has been accused of brutally beating a 66-year-old man before leaving him to die in the street.

Beau Smith, 22, a wide receiver for Williamette University, appeared in Marion County Circuit Court in Oregon on Thursday, accused of murdering Michael Hampshire, a retired airplane mechanic.

A passerby found Hampshire's body at an intersection just two blocks from the man's home at 3.42am on Wednesday. When police arrived, they declared him dead.

Pastor Dallas Yetter said Hampshire often took walks in the night when he had trouble sleeping and said he believes the man fell victim to a random attack.

'I don't know anything about Beau Smith,' Yetter told the Statesman Journal. 'My guess is it was a random beating... Something took place that wasn't right there. It's just a shock, and sad.'

After the body was found, a man covered in blood - believed to be Smith - waved down a patrolman a few blocks away, raised his arms and said, 'I need help, I was in a fight', sources told CBS.

The Willamette senior and chemistry major, who is from Roseville, California, was taken in to custody and is being held on a charge of murder.

It is unclear whether a weapon was used but the medical examiner concluded that Hampshire died of blunt force injuries to the head.

Top student: Smith, a chemistry major at Willamette University, had a 4.0 GPA in high school

Marion County District Attorney Doug Hanson told the Sacramento Bee that officials are still investigating what happened but they have no reason to believe the two men knew each other. 

Hampshire's neighbors said they don't recognize Smith and a university spokesperson said Hampshire had no affiliation with the school.

The university released a statement saying they are cooperating fully with the investigation and they have started their own student conduct investigation.

They would not say whether Smith is still considered an enrolled student. 

Smith's attorney said he may enter a plea when he next appears in court, on December 11.

He has been denied bail, in accordance with Oregon law. 

Before the next appearance, his attorney is working on providing evidence to the state that Smith is a strong student and athlete, as well as character references.

The student was in the top five per cent of his high school graduating class in Roseville and had a 4.0-plus grade point average, according to the Sacramento Bee.

He then moved to Oregon to attend Williamete, where he played for the Bearcats - first as free safety and tight end before playing as wife receiver.

The school's athletic records show he caught four touchdowns and 17 passes last year.

'He was never in trouble,' Former Roseville High Principal Brad Basham said. He said the fact that the young man has been arrested for murder is 'almost unbelievable'.

Scene: Hampshire's body was found by a passerby just blocks from his home on Wednesday morning

Hampshire was remembered as a friendly neighbor who volunteered at a food share and enjoyed working on remodeling projects at his home.

Oregon Department of Corrections records show he had completed probation in 2013 for menacing, the Bee reported.

He lived alone with his dog after he and his wife separated a few years ago, his pastor told the Stateman Journal.

'He would catch me out in the yard working and just come over and talk,' Yetter said. 'He liked working with his hands. He was innovative and liked to try new things. He liked a challenge.'
