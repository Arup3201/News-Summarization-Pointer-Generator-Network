Syrian forces have continued to relentlessly shell its own people in Homs after claims more than 14 people had been slain in front of a Co-op in the rebel city.

Thousands of Syrians are stranded in a district overrun by regime troops, with a Red Cross aid convoy blocked from the area due to booby traps and mines.

Syrian government forces took control of the western Homs neighbourhood of Baba Amr, where conditions are said to be 'catastrophic' due to food, water and medical care shortages.

Local media reports today said up to 14 people had been executed outside a government cooperative building selling subsidised food.

The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had received reports people had been killed in front of the Co-op, which was also reportedly being used as a prison.

Butcher: Syrian President Bashar Assad

The latest reported slayings come as activists claim President Bashar Assadâ€™s troops have been going from house to house in a scorched-earth campaign, backed by relentless shelling.

The Red Cross said it had received permission from President Bashar Assad's government to enter Baba Amr.

A convoy of seven trucks with 15 tons of humanitarian aid including food, medical supplies and blankets left Damascus on Friday, taking several hours in heavy snowfall to reach Homs.

But once they neared Baba Amr, the government prevented them from entering.

The Syrian government has not offered its explanation for revoking the permission.

The Local Coordination Committees activist network said mortars slammed into the districts of Khaldiyeh, Bab Sbaa and Khader.

Abu
Hassan al-Homsi, a doctor at a makeshift clinic in Khaldiyeh district 
of Homs, said he treated a dozen people who were wounded, most lightly.

'This
has become routine, the mortars start falling early in the morning,' he
said. Several homes were damaged from the morning shelling, which he 
described as steady but intermittent.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called
on Syria to give humanitarian workers immediate access to people who 
desperately need aid.

His calls came after David Cameron 
accused President Assad of 'butchering his own people' in a scathing 
attack on the Syrian regime.

In other violence Saturday, a suicide car bomb exploded in Daraa, killing at least two people and wounding 20, activists said.

The
state-run news agency said the blast occurred at a roundabout in an 
area known as Daraa al-Balad and said there were casualties including 
civilians and security forces.

Daraa is the birthplace of the nearly year-old uprising against Assad. The revolt has killed more than 7,500 people, according to the most recent U.N. estimate.

Syria has seen a string of suicide bombings, the last on Feb. 10, when twin blasts struck security compounds in the government stronghold city of Aleppo, killing 28 people and bringing significant violence for the first time to the city.

The capital Damascus, another Assad stronghold, has seen three suicide bombings in the past two months.

The regime has touted the attacks as proof that it is being targeted by 'terrorists.' The opposition accuses forces loyal to the government of being behind the bombings to tarnish the uprising.
