Rusty the red panda has been found after disappearing from his enclosure at Smithsonian National Zoo overnight.

Staff spent seven hours frantically combing the grounds of the Washington D.C. sanctuary and the surrounding areas for the animal - even shutting down the zoo for two hours this morning. Finally, Rusty was discovered in the Adams Morgan neighborhood nearby the Smithsonian. He had spent 24 hours on the loose.

'Rusty the red panda has been recovered, crated & is headed safely back to the National Zoo!' the zoo tweeted around 2.25 p.m. EST.

The little guy was spotted by a passerby around 2 p.m., just south of the zoo near 20th and Biltmore streets. Ashley Foughty took a picture of Rusty scurrying in the bushes and tweeted it to the zoo with a note saying 'Red panda in our neighborhood. Please come save him!'

Smithsonian staff quickly rushed to the location and apprehended the missing creature.

Code Green: Officials at the zoo, pictured, sounded the 'Code Green' alert for an escaped animal when they noticed Rusty missing in June

Officials first discovered the male panda, who is less than a year old and the size of a raccoon, had disappeared at 7:30 a.m. and immediately sounded a 'Code Green' alert for an escaped animal.

'We have been searching all morning,' spokeswoman Pamela Baker-Masson told The Washington Post earlier today.

'It is most likely that he has not really left the vicinity. He would have to have some very strong motivation to leave the area.'

Rusty hasn't been long at the zoo, having arrived from Lincoln, Nebraska, in late April. He has only been on exhibit for about three weeks. The zoo is planning to breed Rusty with its female red panda, Shama.

Before he fled, the animal hadn't been seen at 6 p.m. Sunday. Staff thought he may have braved 'hot wires' to escape his enclosure and would be hiding somewhere inside the zoo.

They feared, however, that he could be sick or may even have died somewhere 
on the grounds his handlers said his appetite had waned in recent days. Officials were also looking into the possibility that the exotic animal was stolen.

Baker-Masson had insisted the animal wasn't dangerous to the public.

'This animal is not dangerous to any human,' Baker-Masson said. 'He is vaccinated.'

But they said that while being friendly and mild-manners, Rusty, who has thick reddish fur and a long tail ringed with white circles, 'will bite if cornered or scared.'
