Police investigating a video of a dog walker swinging a Chihuahua off the ground by its lead have arrested a teenager.

The 19-year-old man was taken into custody after an urgent investigation was launched yesterday when footage emerged on social media.

The incident, which happened in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, was filmed by an onlooker and shows a man walking along with a group of three other men while he repeatedly thrusts the dog up in the air.

A man was filmed as he walked along Julians Road in Stevenage and swung the dog in the air by its lead

He was with a group of three other men while walking the dog and one appears to be carrying a pack of lager

A
 spokesman from Hertfordshire Police said: ‘A 19-year old man from 
Welwyn Garden City has been arrested following an appeal showing a dog 
being swung by its lead in Stevenage.

‘The man was arrested on suspicion of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.

‘He is currently in police custody and will be interviewed by detectives.’

It
 is believed the dog’s owner had allowed the men to walk the pet but was
 unaware of the incident until the video was posted on Facebook page 
‘Spotted in Stevenage’ on Thursday night.

In the footage another man can be seen carrying a pack of lager while a third member of the group walks a second dog on a lead.

Hertfordshire police say the male Chihuahua was not injured and was returned to its owner that evening.

PC
 Lindsey Cox from the Stevenage Safer Neighbourhood Team said: ‘No 
animal deserves to be treated in this way and we are taking this matter 
extremely seriously.’

The footage sparked outrage when it appeared 
online and prompted several people to report it to animal welfare 
charity the RSPCA.

Jessica Louise, 22, from Stevenage witnessed the video she described as ‘sick’ on a ‘selling site’.

She
 said: ‘I was reading comments on the post and a lady had commented 
saying it was her friend’s dog and she knows the lads personally.

‘She said that she had allowed them to walk the dog while she was at work and trusted them.’

A
 spokesperson from the RSPCA confirmed they had received a number of 
complaints and said: ‘We are very concerned about this footage of 
someone swinging a Chihuahua around on a lead. This would likely have 
caused the animal great distress as well as potentially serious injury.

‘We
 urge people to remember that they have a legal and moral responsibility
 to ensure animals in their care are properly looked after, free of 
suffering, with all their needs catered for.’

The anonymous owner of 
Facebook page ‘Spotted in Stevenage’, who calls himself The Stevenage 
STIG, was one of the people responsible for sharing the video online 
last night.

He said: ‘I feel that after I had posted the video it 
would reach out to many people in Stevenage and we would come together 
to find these scum.

‘Previously a girl had been missing in Stevenage
 and through my page everyone got together and shared the link to help 
find her safely.

‘My page has comes under fire many times because it
 has been controversial in its content, however in matters such as these
 or any other incident that happens locally, I will highlight it on my 
page good or bad.’

Since the arrest he has posted a ‘thank you’ to 
the page’s followers adding: ‘Even though we may make fun of the town 
and the characters in it, it just goes to show when it comes to serious 
matters our solidarity shines through as a community. You should all be 
very proud of yourselves’.
