An 80-year-old Japanese extreme skier and an 81-year-old Nepalese former Gurkha are in a race to become the oldest climbers to reach the summit of Mount Everest.

Yuichiro Miura climbed Mount Everest five years ago, but just missed out on the record when Min Bahadur Sherchan nipped in to claim it.

And the pair are set to do battle again as they are both aiming to conquer the mountain in the next few weeks.

Miura on Wednesday was already in the
'death zone,' the steep, icy, oxygen-deficient area close to the 
8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit. His rival, Min Bahadur Sherchan, from 
Nepal, was at the base camp preparing for his own attempt on the summit 
next week.

On his expedition's website, Miura 
explained his attempt to scale Everest at such an advanced age: 'It is 
to challenge (my) own ultimate limit. It is to honor the great Mother 
Nature.'

He said a successful climb would raise the bar for what is possible.

'And if the limit of age 80 is at the summit of Mt. Everest, the highest place on earth, one can never be happier,' he said.

Miura reached the South Col, the 
jumping-off point for most final ascents, on Tuesday, according to his 
website, which also posted pictures of him eating hand-rolled sushi 
inside a tent.

'Miura is reported to be in good 
health and he and his team are aiming to reach the summit on Thursday 
morning,' said Gyanendra Shrestha, a Nepalese mountaineering official at
the base camp.

Not his first time: Miura, right, takes a break with his son, Gota, on their way to a camp at 6,500 metres. He says the feat, while difficult for a man of any age, will add 70 years to his physical body age - making him feel more like 150 years old

If Miura makes it to the top, he would capture the record. But it would only last a few days if Sherchan is able to follow him.

Still competitive: Min Bahadur Sherchan has announced he plans to start climbing Everest next week after hearing his record could be broken

Miura's daughter, Emili Miura, said 
he 'doesn't really care' about the rivalry. 'He's doing it for his own 
challenge,' she said.

The situation was not too different 
five years ago, when, at the age of 75, Miura sought to recapture the 
title of oldest man to summit the mountain. He had set the record in 
2003 at age 70, but it was later broken twice by slightly older Japanese
climbers.

He reached the summit on May 26, 
2008, at the age of 75 years and 227 days, according to Guinness World 
Records. But the record eluded him because Sherchan had scaled the 
summit the day before, at the age of 76 years and 340 days.

Sherchan, a former Gurkha soldier in 
the British army, first began mountaineering in 1960 when he climbed 
Mount Dhaulagiri, the 8,167-meter (26,790-foot) high peak in Nepal, 
according to his grandson, Manoj Guachan.

Always an adventurer, and unbowed by age, he walked the length of Nepal in 2003.

Sherchan and his team said Wednesday 
that they were prepared for their new climb, despite digestive problems 
he suffered several days ago.

'Our team leader has just arrived 
back at base camp and we are holding a team meeting on when exactly I 
will head up to the summit,' Sherchan, who uses a hearing aid, said by 
telephone from the base camp.

'I am fine and in good health. I am ready to take up the challenge. Our plan is to reach the summit within one week.'

It takes three to four days for climbers to reach Camp 4 on South Col from base camp, and another day to reach the summit.

There are only a few windows of good 
weather during the climbing season in May for people to attempt the 
summit. That could favour Miura.

Conditions should be favorable 
Wednesday and Thursday, but they were expected to deteriorate after 
Friday, said Shrestha, the mountaineering official at base camp.

Father and son: Miura has had three heart operations in recent years and suffered a broken pelvis and fractured thigh in a 2009 ski accident

Sherchan's team is also facing 
financial difficulties. It hasn't received the financial help that the 
Nepal government announced it would provide them. Purna Chandra 
Bhattarai, chief of Nepal's mountaineering department, said the aid 
proposal was still under consideration. 
Miura faced difficulties of his own.

He fractured his pelvis and left 
thigh bone in a 2009 skiing accident, and had an operation in January 
for an irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia, his fourth heart surgery 
since 2007, according to Emili Miura.

His daughter said Miura decided to go
ahead with the expedition despite the surgery because he felt that at 
age 80, he was running out of time.

'If he was in his 60s, he probably 
would have waited for another year or two, but at the age of 80 he's not
getting any younger. He has a strong determination that now is the 
time,' she said in a phone interview.

On his ascent, Miura made a stop at 
the rarely used Camp 5 to take a break between the South Col and the 
summit. Almost all the climbers these days walk straight from Camp 4 to 
the summit. 
Miura was well-known long before his late-in-life mountaineering pursuits.

He was a daredevil speed skier who 
skied down Everest's South Col in 1970, using a parachute to brake his 
descent. The feat was captured in the Oscar-winning 1975 documentary, 
"The Man Who Skied Down Everest."

In 1964, he briefly set a world speed
skiing record in the Italian Alps, reaching 172 kilometers per hour 
(107 mph). He also skied down Mt. Fuji using parachutes.

It wasn't until Miura was 70, 
however, that he first climbed all the way to the summit of Everest. 
When he summited again at 75, he claimed to be the only man to 
accomplish the feat twice in his 70s. After that, he said he was 
determined to climb again at age 80.

Miura is accompanied on the 
expedition by his son Gota, a two-time Olympian skier. Gota Miura, 43, 
summited Everest in 2003 with his father, but had to turn back short of 
the summit in 2008 due to symptoms of high altitude cerebral edema.
