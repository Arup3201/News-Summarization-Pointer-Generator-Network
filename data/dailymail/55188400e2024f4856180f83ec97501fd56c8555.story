One of Tiger Woods' front teeth was knocked out by a cameraman during a media scramble after his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn won another World Cup event in Italy on Monday.

The golfer revealed the gap in his mouth as he congratulated the skier following her winning run in Cortina D'Ampezzo - her 63rd World Cup victory.

He had hidden behind a skeleton-covered mask before surprising Vonn but it seems she was not the only one who didn't recognise the former world No 1, as the media promptly trampled him.

'During a crush of photographers at the awards' podium at the World Cup event in Italy, a media member with a shoulder-mounted video camera pushed and surged towards the stage, turned and hit Tiger Woods in the mouth,' Woods' agent Mark Steinberg said. 

'Woods's tooth was knocked out by the incident.' 

Vonn broke Annemarie Moser-Proell's 35-year-old record of 62 World Cup wins with a flawless run down the Olympia delle Tofane course, finishing 0.85 ahead of Anna Fenninger of Austria.

'I'm so happy to have finished the weekend with win No. 63. My family and Tiger is here. It's a really, really special day,' Vonn said following her triumph. 

Vonn had been on track to shatter the record two years ago before a high-speed crash at the 2013 world championships in Schladming, Austria, when she tore two ligaments in her right knee.

She attempted to return for Sochi but re-injured her knee in Val d'Isere, France, in December, 2013, requiring a second surgery.

She is planning to compete through the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
