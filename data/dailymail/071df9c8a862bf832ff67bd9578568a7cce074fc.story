For those paranoid about protecting their selfies, Boeing and Blackberry may have the ultimate handset.

Designed for secure communication between governmental agencies and their contractors, the handset can self destruct if it is tampered with, destroying all the data on it.

However, the phone is so secure that Boeing will only sell it to 'approved' purchasers.

The dual-sim phone supports GSM, WCDMA and LTE for high speed data.

It will also have a HDMI port to allow it to be hooked up to a TV.

The handset also comes with USB , Wifi and Bluetooth.

It will run a secure version of Google's Android software.

Blackberry confirmed the existence of the project - but refused to reveal any more information.

'We're pleased to announce that Boeing is collaborating with BlackBerry to provide a secure mobile solution for Android devices utilizing our BES 12 platform,' BlackBerry CEO John Chen said on a conference call held to discuss its quarterly results.

'That, by the way, is all they allow me to say.' 

The Boeing Black phone being developed by the Chicago-based aerospace and defense contractor, which is best known for jetliners and fighter planes, can self-destruct if it is tampered with.

The Boeing Black device encrypts calls and is aimed at government agencies and others that need to keep communications and data secure. 

The Boeing phone uses dual SIM cards to enable it to access multiple cell networks and can be configured to connect with biometric sensors and satellites. Boeing has begun offering the phone to potential customers.

The secret handset was uncovered by website myce, who spotted an FCC filing for it.

According to the filing the Boeing Black is primarily designed for secure communication between governmental agencies and their contractors.

Although the majority of its features are listed as 'protected' and will remain secret, the documents do reveal the dual-sim phone supports GSM, WCDMA and LTE  using micro SIM cards.

The FCC filing reveal very little about the phone - other than its shape and the fact it will take two sim cards

It will also have a HDMI port to allow it to be hooked up to a TV, and USB , Wifi and Bluetooth.

'The phone will be sold primarily to government agencies and companies  engaged in contractual activities with those agencies that are related to defense and homeland security,' Boeing says.

It plans to limit the sale of the device to 'approved' buyers.

'The device will be marketed and sold in a manner such that low level technical and operational information about the product will not be provided to the general public.'

Even if approved, buyers will have to sign an agreement agreeing to keep their details of the phone secret.

'Specifically designates and protects as 'proprietary information' the components, hardware, Product Software, applications, functionalities, or internal structure or workings of the Product provided by Seller, including without limitation those that can be obtained by disassembling or opening the Product or its software or components.'

It also reveals that the handset will be completely sealed, and any attempt to open it will destroy the phone and delete all the data on it.

'There are no serviceable parts on Boeing's Black phone and any attempted servicing or replacing of parts would destroy the product.

'The Boeing Black phone is manufactured as a sealed device both with epoxy around the casing and with screws, the heads of which are covered with tamper proof covering to identify attempted disassembly.

'Any attempt to break open the casing of the device would trigger functions that would delete the data and software contained within the device and make the device inoperable.'
