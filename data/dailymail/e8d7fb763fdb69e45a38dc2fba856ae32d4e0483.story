Harry Kane has to be in the England squad next month. He’s made the step at every level. England is the next natural stage of his development. To play in his first north London derby and score twice is extraordinary.

When you’re looking at a youngster, you bring them into first-team training to see what they can do against your experienced players.

And if he copes with that, you take the next step and put him on the pitch. Then you find out for real and the player finds out as well.

Tottenham striker Harry Kane has shown he is capable of being in the spotlight by impressing against Arsenal

Kane has progressed bit by bit. He’s been able to reproduce in the first team everything he’s done in the youth team and Under 21s.

Then the confidence comes and suddenly you have a player. I love the fact that for the first goal against Arsenal, the minute the ball came off the hand of David Ospina, he’s reacting. There was no tightness or freezing up.

He knew exactly where he was going. He had scored in that split second. He was relaxed and put it away.

He has a little bit of everything. He can play in the pocket and up top and his movement is very cute. For the second goal, if he hadn’t moved to the side of Laurent Koscielny, he wouldn’t get the chance to score that great header.

It was a fantastic performance all round from Tottenham. Their intensity and tempo was superb throughout the 90 minutes. There are three players who have elevated them this season: one is Kane, another is Christian Eriksen but the third is Mousa Dembele.

He’s one of the best in the country at going past a player. But if he does it in a deep position, he’s not the same threat as when he plays behind the striker.

I feel he’s more suited to that position than Eriksen, because the formation they have at the moment allows Eriksen to drift in from wide positions. They’ve found a balance in those front players. I’d play Andros Townsend ahead of Erik Lamela, but the formula is working well at the moment.

And the full backs, Kyle Walker and Danny Rose, are absolutely key. They have the energy to provide width and they release Eriksen and Lamela to come inside, which is crucial to the balance of the team.

If they can keep those two fit and fresh, then Tottenham may be able to negotiate upcoming Europa League games and keep on track for the top four.
