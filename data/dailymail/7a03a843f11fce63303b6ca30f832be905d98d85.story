Stuart Lancaster has given the strongest indication yet that Steffon Armitage’s dream of playing for England in next year’s World Cup will not be realised.

The Toulon flanker cannot currently be selected for England due to the RFU’s strict policy on overseas players, and last week The Mail on Sunday revealed that Lancaster’s refusal to guarantee he would pick him if he moved to Bath played a large part in scuppering the deal.

Armitage, 29, sought assurances that he would be included in Lancaster’s 33-man elite player squad, which was named on Wednesday, but the England head coach would not offer preferential treatment, leading to the Bath deal collapsing and Armitage hinting that he could now try to gain selection for France on residency grounds.

When asked if the door was closed on Armitage, Lancaster said: ‘He has obviously chosen to stay at Toulon, so yes in the short term.

‘We’ll obviously have to wait and see how it plays out, if there is any truth in the rumour in him wanting to go down a different nationality route. I don’t know. But I’ve made it clear that in order to be playing in this series and the Six Nations he would have to be back here playing, and he’s not.’

When asked if he had refused to offer Armitage any guarantees he would be picked, Lancaster replied: ‘I can’t guarantee anyone anything. It’s right that people have to earn their right to get into the team. I don’t guarantee Chris Robshaw a place. I don’t guarantee anyone. They have to earn the right. It’s the basis of group dynamics.

‘You have got to give everyone a fair and equal opportunity. There are a lot of people who have worked extremely hard to get this opportunity and if you can be on the end of the phone call when you tell a Calum Clark or a Semesa Rokoduguni that he will get a chance to come and train with England it is then unfair to say that actually this guy has got a guaranteed pick.’

Clark’s selection — as first reported in last week’s Mail on Sunday — behind Robshaw, Tom Wood and James Haskell means Armitage appears too far down the pecking order to have a hope of inclusion next September.

Lancaster is expected to call up Saracens flanker Will Fraser on Sunday, along with Exeter’s exciting young centre Henry Slade and five other players, including Saracens scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth and Bath winger Anthony Watson.

The England head coach has told his players that with only 12 Tests to play before the World Cup and ‘time running out’, his side must claim at least three victories in four Tests this autumn, starting against the All Blacks on November 8, to be considered serious contenders.

But, with one eye on next year’s home tournament, Lancaster also revealed this week that he intends to use the Test against Samoa on November 22 — which kicks off at 7pm — to streamline procedures for late matches to help players avoid boredom.

‘That week will be a slightly different week anyway,’ Lancaster said. ‘We’ll have played New Zealand and then South Africa — two massively big and physical teams — so we might adapt the week differently and give the players a little bit of a break at the start of the week. We will probably do our captain’s run at a later time of day. Little things like that will be different.

‘By having the captain’s run later, the players might go to bed a bit later and therefore might wake up a bit later. You move your meals accordingly to deal with that evening kick-off. What you do on the day of the game... it’s quite a long time. When you’re a player it’s even worse. You need to fill your day appropriately so that you’re physically firing at the right time.

Lancaster said no player in his England squad is guaranteed a place in the team

‘Part of that then allows us to look at what our processes are and our build-up to evening kick-offs. Because all our World Cup games are evening kick-offs.

‘It was a collective decision by the union because we’ve got three games at 8pm during the World Cup. That does affect how you structure your day. It affects the stadium — playing under floodlights — and everything else.

‘That apart we’ll be operating our build-ups as normal.’

Lancaster’s inclusion of Rokoduguni — an uncapped Fijian-born soldier in the British Army — drew most attention. The 27-year-old has been in scintillating form for Bath this season just two years after signing professional papers and seven years after touring Afghanistan’s notorious Helmand province as an infantryman.

‘I said to the boys at Bath, if you go out on the pitch and something goes wrong you can always come back next week, review it, go through the process and come back better and stronger,’ Rokoduguni told The Mail on Sunday.

‘But out there in Afghanistan you can’t afford to make those kind of mistakes because you are putting someone’s life in danger out there.

The naming of Bath flyer Semesa Rokoduguni attracted the most attention when the squad was named

‘If you mess something up or miss an opportunity you are letting the boys down and allowing the terrorists time to kill someone. You can’t afford to do that.

‘In my first week out there I witnessed a Marine lose both of his legs and I was thinking to myself, “That could be me”.

‘The way I see it now I want to make every opportunity count and take every single opportunity that comes my way.

‘When you experience something like that it teaches you a lesson in life. That’s how I’m looking at my professional rugby career. I have one go at this and I don’t intend to mess it up.’

Lancaster — a big supporter of the armed forces — will consider asking Rokoduguni to relive his experiences in Afghanistan to the wider squad.

‘I wouldn’t want to put that on him to start with,’ Lancaster said. ‘But potentially (I’ll ask him to talk).

‘I want to settle him in and make him feel comfortable. He came in in June which was great because we got to know him a bit before we flew to New Zealand — he played in that Barbarians game.

‘We’ll see how he goes against the All Blacks.’
