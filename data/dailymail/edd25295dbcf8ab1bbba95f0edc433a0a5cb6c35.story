A cross-party group of MPs and peers will table a report on Monday calling for an urgent Parliamentary inquiry into concussion in sport and funding for independent research to investigate the link between head injuries and early onset dementia.

The group, led by Labour MP Chris Bryant and Paralympian Dame Tanni-Grey Thompson, will praise The Mail on Sunday’s long-running concussion campaign, while urging sport’s authorities to improve protocols following decades of inaction.

Impressed: Labour Party MP Chris Bryant will praise the Mail on Sunday's Concussion Campaign

‘Professional sport has dragged its heels for far too long over the risks associated with concussion,’ one contributor to the report told The Mail on Sunday. ‘All sports need to simplify the message and tell parents very clearly that concussion can kill.’

Last week we exclusively revealed that former England and West Bromwich Albion star Jeff Astle, who died in 2002 aged 59 suffering severe dementia, was the first English professional footballer to be diagnosed with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), found in American footballers.

The Football Association promised a 10-year joint study with the Professional Footballers Association into head injuries following Astle’s death but our investigation found that the study was never completed due to woeful under-resourcing.

‘What the Jeff Astle case shows is that complacency and turning a blind eye is just not good enough,’ said Bryant.

‘We are letting players, especially young players down if we don’t take this seriously — and soon.’Astle’s family will be at the House of Commons on Monday, along with Peter and Carol Robinson, whose 14-year-old son Ben died in 2011 after sustaining serious head injuries while playing rugby but being allowed to play on.

‘If anyone present at the ground that day had understood the risks associated with concussion Ben would still be alive today,’ his father said.

‘It was Ben’s 18th birthday last week but instead of buying him a birthday cake I sent flowers to his grave.’
