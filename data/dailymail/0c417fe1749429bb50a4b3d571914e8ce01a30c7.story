Two of Spain’s most wanted ETA terrorists were arrested this morning in dawn raids by armed police in London.

Police held fugitives Antonio Troitino Arranz and Ignacio Lerin Sanchez in a 4am swoop in Hounslow for their suspected involvement in the Basque separatist group, the Spanish Interior Ministry said.

Troitino, 55, has been convicted of 22 murders including a 1986 bombing in Madrid which killed 12 police officers, and had been on the run for over a year.

Lerin, 38, from Pamplona, is 
considered one of ETA’s most dangerous terrorists and has been on the 
run since April 2007, the ministry said.

The pair were said to be sharing a residence in Hounslow, living clandestinely in the capital and using false documents.

Both men are wanted by the National Court in Madrid, which specialises in terrorist cases.

Troitino, from the Palencia province of northern Spain, was one of ETA’s most prolific killers in the 1980s.

In July 1986 he detonated a car bomb 
by remote control in the Plaza de la Republica Dominicana in the Spanish
capital. The blast destroyed a Civil Guard van, killing 12 officers and
wounding 51 people.

He was arrested in 1987 and jailed for 2,232 years at the National Court in 1989.

There was public outrage when Troitino
was released from prison in April last year after serving 24 years. 
Days later the National Court revoked his release and ordered him back 
to jail, but he went on the run before security services could locate 
him.

Spain’s Interior Ministry said the two
men were arrested in a joint operation between the Metropolitan police 
and Spain’s National Police.

They said in a statement: 'These two 
fugitives from the terrorist organisation ETA were on the security 
services’ most wanted list and are also wanted by the National Court.

'Troitino was responsible for more than 20 murders in a number of terrorist attacks.

'He is the subject of a European Arrest Warrant issued by the National Court, for belonging to a terrorist organisation.

Terror: Masked members of ETA raise their fists as they declare a permanent cease-fire in January. The separatist cell has killed more than 800 people since it launched its campaign for an independent Basque state in the late 1960s

'In 1985 he joined ETA’s terrorist 
cell in Madrid. This cell’s actions were particularly bloody, and they 
were responsible for the brutal attack against a Civil Guard bus which 
killed 12 Civil Guard officers and wounded 51 others.

'Lerin is the subject of an European 
Arrest Warrant issued by the National Court, for belonging to a 
terrorist organisation and possession of explosives.

'These arrests have dealt a powerful 
blow to ETA, as Antonio Troitino was a key figure in the terrorist 
organisation and had direct links with the current leadership of the 
terrorist group.

'The operation is ongoing.'

ETA has killed more than 800 people since it launched its campaign for an independent Basque state in the late 1960s.

In January last year the group announced a 'permanent ceasefire' following more than 40 years of bloodshed.

The terrorist group is being urged to hand over its weapons and make a public apology to victims.
