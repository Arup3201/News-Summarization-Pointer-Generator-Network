From Damien Hirst sacrificing 9,000 butterflies to Tracey Emin scrawling the names of every one of her lovers onto a tent, some artists make a living out of pushing boundaries.

But
 one young creative has pushed them to a whole new level. Cutting-edge artist Millie Brown, who shot to fame as the girl who drank coloured milk and regurgitated it over Lady Gaga on stage, has embarked on her most challenging work to date.

Wilting Point, as her work is called, sees the British performance artist enclosed in Hatbox, a gallery space at Refinery Hotel in New York, removed from the outside world for 168 continuous hours.

A work of art: Millie Brown's latest performance sees her enclosed in  a gallery space removed from the outside world for 168 continuous hours surviving on only water

Surrounded by a carpet of freshly-cut flowers, Brown is currently lying in complete isolation immersing herself in a meditative state and surviving solely on water for the entire seven days.

Speaking about the challenge, which began on Friday and forms part of NYC's Frieze Art week, the 27-year-old said: 'I wanted to create a performance that embodied the transience of life.

'I wanted to eliminate all the distractions from my daily reality in order to focus on the impermanence and fragile beauty of our existence.'

Withstanding the physical discomfort and inevitably entering into an altered mental state, Brown will apparently use this fast to 'enable herself to explore the depths the mind can reach, once physical comforts and limitations have been removed'.

Her toughest challenge yet: Surrounded by a carpet of freshly-cut flowers, Brown wants to immerse herself in a meditative state  

The public are being encouraged to follow the evolution of Brown's performance both in person, where she can be glimpsed from the sidewalk through the window of Refinery Hotel's Hatbox, and via VMAGAZINE.COM, where the performance is being live-streamed 24 hours a day.

Speaking to the magazine about the inspiration behind her performance, she said: 'I always strive to push through my own physical and mental barriers. I think it’s important to experience everything you can, on every end of the spectrum.

'I believe it’s important to make yourself uncomfortable and learn to separate mind and body in order to reach a raw, primal state of being.'

A spokesman B-eat (Beating Eating Disorders) said: 'The artist here is making a choice. Purging is often an extremely secretive behaviour, something that an individual will do anything to hide from others and there certainly are negative health impacts related to purging in this way.'

So
sick: Gaga performed on the Doritos Bold Stage at Stubb's BBQ and had 
performance artist Millie Brown throw up paint on to her

Quirky: Young artist Millie Brown has taught herself how to regurgitate paint to create quirky canvas art

Bohemian: Sleeping in abandoned buildings and driving around Europe in trucks became part of her everyday adventures

The eccentric artist - whose unique work
features in Ripley’s Believe it or Not! - is better known for her 'vomit art', whereby she uses a selection of dyed soy 
milk in a mixture of colours which she then swallows at various 
intervals, one at a time, before vomiting it onto a white canvas.

But despite the regular 
retching, Millie insists it doesn’t affect her health. She said she
 maintains a healthy vegan lifestyle and always leaves a one month rest 
period between each performance.

The vomiting visionary
 began experimenting with her unique style back in 2005 and has since 
gained commercial success by regurgitating onto the dress of pop singer,
 Lady Gaga, in a controversial music video.

Millie can be seen vomiting shimmering turquoise liquid over the 
singer in Lary Gaga's pop music video, Exorcist Interlude, and starred on stage with her.

However, Katy Perry isn't a fan. As she kicked off her tour in Northern 
Ireland, fans were treated to a video montage of her sticking her finger
 in her mouth and spitting up blue and green paint, in what could be 
perceived as a mocking nod to Gaga's infamous vomiting performance at 
SXSW.

The video showed Katy vomiting the paint over herself and the walls.

It was similar to Gaga's performance with Millie at the Doritos Bold Stage at Stubb's BBQ earlier this year.

Born in England to Bohemian parents 
and spending much of her youth in Spain and the South of France, it is 
clear where Millie’s maverick tendencies originated.

Aged 13 and unable to relate the French children of her neighborhood, Millie befriended local street punks.

From then on, sleeping in abandoned buildings and driving around Europe in trucks became part of her everyday adventures.

After
a brief summer stint in LA, Millie returned to London at the age of 
17 where she embarked upon her artistic journey in performance art and 
film.
