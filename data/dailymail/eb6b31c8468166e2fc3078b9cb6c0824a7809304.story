World markets were hit by another bout of global economic growth fears today with London shares falling 2.8 per cent as the copper price was hammered.

The euro also fell below its 1999 launch value versus the dollar for the first time in nine years, and to six-year lows against the pound.

The single currency was hit by growing expectations that the European Central Bank will announce a government bond-buying programme to jumpstart the eurozone economy out of deflation.

But wider market jitters were caused by the World Bank slashing its overall growth forecast for 2015 from 3.4 per cent to 3 per cent, citing stagnation in Europe and in Japan.

The bank also highlighted a slowdown in China's expansion and estimated growth for 2014 at 2.6 per cent, well below earlier expectations of 2.8 per cent.

That hammered copper, a leading barometer of industrial demand, whose global price fell 6 per cent - its biggest drop in nine years mirroring the continuing slump in the world oil price, which has more than halved in six months, also on global growth concerns.

In turn that hit heavyweight commodity and mining shares in London, sending the FTSE 100 index plunging 180 points to 6,362.2. Leading shares on Wall Street meanwhile opened 1.2 per cent down, and the French and German blue-chip indices were down by a similar amount. 

The euro fell 0.4 per cent to $1.1728, its lowest level in nine years and below $1.1747, the level it started trading at in Sydney on January 4 1999. The euro also hit a new six-year lows against sterling at 77.40p, making a pound worth €1.295.  

The fresh falls by the single currency came as an adviser to Europe's top court said that an earlier, unused, ECB bond-buying programme proposed in 2012 was pretty much legal.

Pedro Cruz Villalon, advocate general at the court, said while the ECB was entitled to buy bonds and that the Outright Monetary Transactions scheme outlined was 'necessary' and 'proportionate', it would first have to spell out its justification and remove itself from any direct aid programme to a eurozone member state.

That ruling was seen as leaving the door open for the central bank to embark on outright money-printing for the first time after its next policy meeting on January 22.

Marc Ostwald at ADM Investor Services International said: 'There is nothing in this ruling that blocks QE.' 

Although the advocate general's opinion looked at a bond-buying blueprint from 2012, designed at the height of the financial crisis to avert a break-up of the euro, it could shape future quantitative easing moves by the ECB in order to combat deflation in the eurozone.

Craig Erlam at Alpari said: 'The reason why this ruling was so important was because of the implications it could have had for QE, which the ECB is expected to announce next week.'

The euro has fallen sharply against the dollar over the last month and is now below its 1999 launch level 

Stimulus expected: ECB boss Mario Dragh is expected to unveil a government bond-buying programme after next week's policy meeting for the eurozone's central bank.

He added: 'Had the ECJ ruled against OMTs, Draghi would have come up against significant opposition as the two programs are very similar. Both involve purchasing government bonds on the secondary market, which some have argued constitutes government funding.

'With this hurdle now out of the way, Draghi is free to announce a bond buying program without fearing a backlash from those that previously called it illegal and outside of his remit.' 

The opinion is another milestone in a long-running dispute between the ECB and Germany, the largest member of the 19-country bloc about the merits of printing money to aid the struggling eurozone economy. The German Constitutional Court had referred the OMT legality question to Europe's top court.

Oil prices that have fallen by about 60 percent since June are wreaking havoc on economies that depend on commodities exports. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov called for a 10 percent spending cut on everything but defence on Wednesday.

At the same time, Europe is on shaky ground despite the European Central Bank's bond-buying stimulus plan.

'The global economy is running on a single engine... the American one,' the World Bank's chief economist, Kaushik Basu, said. 'This does not make for a rosy outlook for the world.' 

Analysts said oil prices would remain weak as a result of oversupply, prompting cuts to price forecasts for 2015 and 2016.

Growth for this year is expected to be better than last year partly due to the economic benefits of low oil prices and the strengthening US economy as well as low interest rates, though the pace will be lower than had been thought.

Metal bashed: Copper prices saw their biggest drop in nine years, following on from sharp falls in oil prices, as the World Bank slashed global growth forecasts raising worries about demand or commodities

The eurozone is expected to grow by just 1.1 per cent this year, down from a forecast in June that it would expand by 1.8 per cent, according to the World Bank's Global Economic Prospects report.

The report expects the UK to grow by 2.9 per cent this year, above the average for high income countries of 2.2 per cent but behind the United States at 3.2 per cent.

China is expected to grow by 7.1 per cent this year, a slowdown from 7.4 per cent in 2014, according to the World Bank. 

Brent crude was lower again today at around $46 a barrel compared to $114 in June.

London-listed mining and commodities firms were hammered by the plunge in metal prices, with Glencore shedding £3billion of its value and Anglo American losing more than £1billion of its worth as both plunged by 9 per cent.

Meanwhile, Antofagasta fell 8 per cent and BHP Billiton was down 6 per cent.

The falls by less commodity-focused European markets were less pronounced, however, with Germany's Dax 30 index and France's CAC 40 index both down around 0.3 per cent, helped by the enhanced ECB bond-buying hopes.
