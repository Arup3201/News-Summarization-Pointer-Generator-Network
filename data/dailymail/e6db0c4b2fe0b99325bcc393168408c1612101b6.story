Danny Welbeck was not just the toast of the England dressing room but also the internet as virals flooded social media after Arsenal's new forward bagged a brace against Switzerland. 

Web jokesters were quick to remind Manchester United and Louis van Gaal what they have lost when Welbeck found the net in the 58th minute and fourth minute of time added on in Basle to kickstart England's Euro 2016 qualifying campaign against their most fancied opponent. 

In a mix of new and rehashed old favourites, Welbeck is superimposed holding the 1966 World Cup aloft, on the undershirt of Lionel Messi and on a £10 note - a graphic statement that he is apparently 10 times as good a player as his team-mate Raheem Sterling. Arsene Wenger's savvy £16million signing of the former Red Devil late in the summer transfer window also get an unsurprising airing.

Here are some of the best the internet has to offer after night to remember from the man sometimes simply known as 'Dat Guy'...
