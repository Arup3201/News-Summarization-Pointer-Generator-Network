A 20-year-old drunk man was the first to admit he was an ‘absolute idiot’ for driving with a child on his lap while three other youngsters were in the backseat of his car.

P plater Lucas Matthews decided to take a drive to McDonald's at lunchtime on Sunday after consuming 15 cans of full strength beers to wash down his pizza the night before in Lithgow, NSW.

The man, from Katoomba, was seen by police driving through the restaurant's drive thru with a ten year-old child on his lap, a woman in the front passenger seat and three other children filling up the backseat of the Toyota Camry.

‘I just wanted lunch and the car was full–it was a stupid mistake,’ Matthews told Channel Nine News out the front Lithgow Local court on Thursday after pleading guilty to mid-range drink driving.

When police approached the car the officers allege that the man and boy on his lap were both under the same seat belts which was not properly fastened and the P plates were not displayed on the vehicle.

Police noticed a very strong alcoholic smell when Matthews got out of the car before he admitted to drinking 15 cans of beers the night before when asked by the officers.

He was arrested and taken to Lithgow Police Station, where a breath analysis returned an alleged reading of 0.133.

He was charged with mid-range PCA and booked for not properly restrained, child not restrained as prescribed, and not displaying P plates on his vehicle. 

His driver's licence was also suspended.

When questioned by Channel Nine News outside the court room on Thursday Matthews wasn’t so sure of the amount he had consumed.

‘I don’t know - a fair whack the night before,’ Matthews said.

A remorseful Matthew expressed regret for his careless actions when it was pointed out that he could have killed all three children that were in the car at the time.

‘It’s not something I’m happy about,’ he said.

He was also reported to have called himself an ‘absolute idiot’ during the court hearing.

Matthews will appear back before court in September to be sentenced.
