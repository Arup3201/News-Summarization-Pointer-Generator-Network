A North Carolina woman says she has been receiving threatening calls for the last two years from suspicious people claiming to be debt collectors, telling her she owes money and will face criminal charges if she doesn't pay up.

However Frances Marshall, of Davidson County, says she doesn't have any outstanding debts and the callers can't always tell her what the bills are for.

At one point the so-called debt collectors, who contact the great grandmother from a Charlotte area code and have cited her social security number, claimed that someone was stationed outside her house.

'I felt very violated,' Marshall told FOX8.

They said ''If you want to go this far and have your neighbors see you taken out in handcuffs, we'll be happy to do so''.'

'Well that scared the living daylights out of me.

'I'm thinking there goes my house, there goes my husband, my home ... there goes everything.

'They've taken my life away.'

The amount of money the collectors claim Marshall owes varies from call to call, she said.

The debt collection firm calls itself Forts and Segal, however there is no listing for the agency.

When calling back the number that Marshall has been contacted by - 252 495 6601 - it is a voicemail asking for 'an ACF account number', a name and a phone number.

The voicemail says a 'representative will return your call within 24 to 48 hours'.

Marshall admitted at one point she was going to pay the apparently outstanding bills to make the harassment stop.

However it appears that is what the people at the other end of the call want.

North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper told FOX8 he received more 1,800 complaints in 2013 filed against debt collectors for such things as threatening calls and other illegal practices.

It is illegal to threaten consumers with criminal prosecution.

Cooper said anyone facing this kind of treatment should file a report with the Attorney Generals office.

Frances has reported the calls to the Davidson County Sheriffs Office but the calls continued.

The office said they have a deputy assigned to investigate the matter.

When it comes to owing money, consumer rights are outlined in the The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

Under section 806, it is illegal for debt collectors to harass, oppress or abuse anyone when trying to collect a debt.

Mark Littrell, owner and president of debt collecting agency Source Receivables Management in Greensboro, believes the threats Marshall has been receiving don't add up.

'I don't know any of the instances where someone actually faces criminal charges for a debt unless it's a court system calling them,' Littrell told FOX8.
