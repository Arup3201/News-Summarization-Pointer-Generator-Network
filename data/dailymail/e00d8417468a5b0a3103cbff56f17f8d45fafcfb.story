Prosecutors allege a man living in a Massachusetts hotel put hot sauce in the mouth of his girlfriend's three-year-old son and then taped it shut.

Christopher Delcid, 21, was held on $250,000 bail after pleading not guilty Wednesday to assault and battery on a child and child abandonment.

The boy was found alone in the Danvers hotel room Tuesday. The child told police that bruises on his body were caused by his 'daddy' who hit him with a shoe and a belt as punishment.

Delcid is not the child's biological father, but is the father of his two younger siblings with the boy's mother, Katherine Rodriguez. She has also been arraigned on child abuse charges.

Police responded to the Extended Stay America hotel in Danvers after the hotel's front desk received a call from Delcid's sister concerned about the child.

Officers knocked repeatedly before asking a manager to let them in.

There they found the toddler lying on a mattress in the corner of the room, alone.

He told officers he'd been left there while Rodriguez, Delcid and his two siblings had gone out with friends because he had been 'bad,' reports the Salem News.

He had multiple injuries, and was able to explain how he sustained each one.

A scratch on his face, he told police, he did to himself. He was trying to remove tape from his lips, placed there by his 'daddy' after he'd filled the child's mouth with hot sauce.

A bruise on his calf was caused by Delcid hitting him with a shoe.

Other injuries included bruising to his side and buttocks caused by Delcid hitting him with a belt, a black eye from being punched, and marks around his wrists where they were bound with tape, the boy told police.

The Salem News reports that the little boy told police that he was punished 'Every day. Daddy says Iâ€™m bad every day.'

Delcid's lawyer said his client has alternate explanations for the toddler's injuries.

The boy has ADD and that he has made false accusations against carers in the past, a lawyer for Delcid said. The lawyer claimed that the boy sustained the injuries falling off playground equipment and slamming his own head into things.

Almost two hours after police found the boy, Rodriguez had still not returned to the hotel for her son.

She has been held on $100,000 bail after being arraigned on child abuse charges.

All three of her children have been taken into custody by the Department of Children and Families.
