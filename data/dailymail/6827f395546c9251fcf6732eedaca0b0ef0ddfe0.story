Tesco’s American dream looks to have come to an abrupt halt.

Britain’s biggest retailer says its chain of 200 Fresh & Easy stores will either be sold or closed.

The supermarket’s failure to crack the cut-throat US market is a major blow to the group which has been battling to turn around its UK business following a shock profit warning at the beginning of the year.

Tesco said it had invested £1 billion in Fresh & Easy since its launch in 2007, but the chain has never made a profit, losing £74 million in the first half of this year

Tesco had poured £1bn to its 'Fresh 
& Easy' chain but the supermarket giant, which recently reported its
first drop in profits in 20 years, confirmed it was launching a review 
of its US operation Fresh & Easy that could see some or all of the 
chain closed or sold off.

The
supermarket giant, which failed to make a dent in established US brands
such as Wal-Mart, is due to give a third-quarter trading update to the 
Stock Exchange this morning.

The brand was launched in 2007 but has never made a profit, losing £74 million in the first half of this year, which was itself 1.4 per cent improvement on the same period in 2011.

Philip Clarke admitted the non-food performance was 'not good enough'

Tim Mason, who ran the US business and has been with Tesco for 30 years, has announced he will leave the company.

Mr Clarke said his priority was to deliver long-term value for shareholders and said Fresh & Easy could not make a profit in an acceptable time frame.

'Whilst the business has many positives, its journey to scale and acceptable returns will take too long,' he said.

The supermarket giant had anticipated spreading their huge wings across the Atlantic and making their Fresh and Easy stores as successful as their UK operation.

The first Fresh and Easy store opened in November 2007, and was joined by shops in Arizona, California and Nevada.

But despite vigorous planning - including testing stores and studying how US families ate and what their buying habits were - the chain failed to compete with established big chains like Wal-Mart.

The business said it had been approached in recent months from parties interested in Fresh & Easy.

Tesco was unavailable for comment on the report last night, ahead of today's announcement,  but will report back on the Fresh & Easy review when 
it posts full-year results in April.

It came as they also admitted a key part of its performance in the UK was still not good enough.

The high street giant posted its first fall in profits since 1994 - a 12 per cent drop to £1.7 billion - in October.

After
six consecutive quarters of falling like-for-like sales, the UK's 
biggest supermarket chain managed just 0.1 per cent growth in the second
quarter of its financial year as its £1 billion turnaround revamp 
launched.

Despite the news that Tesco's US operation has not been a success, the supermarket chain's shares rose today by four per cent

But the significant investment - spent
on a range of initiatives from 8,000 extra staff to launching its 
Everyday Value range - took a chunk out of its UK profits.

In
the UK, Tesco said its sales fell back into the red in its third 
quarter after a poor non-food performance held back improvements in its 
grocery arm.

Chief executive Philip Clarke admitted the non-food performance was 'not good enough' as the group reported a 0.6 per cent fall in like-for-like sales excluding VAT and fuel in the 13 weeks to November 24.

Today, however, the group's shares rose four per cent 
today to 340p.

To compound its woes, Tesco’s international arm, once the driving force behind the group, saw profits fall 17 per cent to £378 million as shopping restrictions in South Korea and the eurozone crisis hit Asia and Europe respectively.

At the time, chief executive Philip Clarke said: 'I wouldn’t say we’ve turned a corner, but we’re definitely on the road.'

Mr Clarke, who started his career stacking shelves in a Tesco store, took over from Sir Terry Leahy in 2011, having previously been international and IT director.
