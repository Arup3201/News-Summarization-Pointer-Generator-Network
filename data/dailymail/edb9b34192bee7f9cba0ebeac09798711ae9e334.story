Bob Casale - the guitarist for iconic US band Devo, best known for the 1980 hit Whip It - has died of heart failure, his brother and band member Gerald Casale said Tuesday.

He was 61.

Devo founding member Casale said in a statement that his younger brother's death in New York on Monday was 'sudden" and 'a total shock'.

The loss of Casale has given the music world more reason to mourn following the loss of Devo drummer Alan Myers, who died of brain cancer in June aged 58.

Mourning: Devo drummer Alan Myers lost his battle with brain cancer at age 58

New Wave: Devo - Bob 
Mothersbaugh, Mark Mothersbaugh, Gerald Casale,  Bob Casale and Alan Myers - went on to become 
the sound of a generation in the 70s and 80s

'As an original member of Devo, Bob 
Casale was there in the trenches with me from the beginning,' Gerard Casale 
said in a statement.

'He was my level-headed brother, a solid performer and talented 
audio engineer, always giving more than he got.'

No further details on his death were provided.

The Ohio-based Devo introduced themselves to the world in 1977 by making a frenetic version of the Rolling Stones' Satisfaction.

The new wave band released its Brian Eno-produced debut, Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!, in 1978.

They reached platinum status in the 1980's with record Freedom of Choice, largely thanks to the success of Whip It, which became the theme song of a generation.

Gerald Casale formed Devo with lead singer Mark Mothersbaugh.

Myers, who was the group's third and most famous drummer, has been credited with taking the band out of Ohio and onto the big stage.

'We were mostly in basements and 
garages writing songs,' Gerard Casale said following his death.

'It was Alan that brought everything to life.

'That was the catalyst where everything clicked.

'People watching him thought we were using a drum machine. Nobody had ever drummed like that.'

While
Myers left the group in 1986 after 10 years because of creative differences 
due to the increased use of electronic drum machines, his legacy lived 
on long after that.

Surprisingly, he went from rock star to blue collar worker and took a job as an electrician in Los Angeles. 

Since
2005 had played improvisational music with his wife, Christine Myers, 
in the group Skyline Electric. He had also performed with his daughter, 
Laena Geronimo, in the experimental ensemble Swahili Blonde, reported Rolling Stone.

Skyline Electric will perform a tribute to Myers this Friday, June 28th, at the Human Resources gallery in Chinatown in L.A.

Legacy: Myers is credited with cementing the band's signature sound with his drumming skills

Devo is short for devolution, the idea that man was regressing into an earlier state.
