The European Tour is beginning a search for just the fourth chief executive in its history after the announcement that George O'Grady will step down.

O'Grady, who has been with the Tour for more than 40 years, confirmed on Wednesday that he has asked the board of directors to begin the process to appoint his successor.

The 65-year-old, who will remain in his role until that successor is found, became chief executive on January 1, 2005, succeeding John Jacobs - who led the Tour's formative years from 1971 to 1974 - and Ken Schofield, who took over on January 1, 1975.

In a statement released by the European Tour, O'Grady said: 'In the aftermath of what I believe to have been the best presented Ryder Cup since my first involvement in the contest at Royal Lytham in 1977, I felt this was the right time to ask the board to begin the search for my successor.

'It is my firm belief that, coming towards the end of what has been another incredibly successful season, we are now seeing the green shoots of recovery across Europe and I am pleased that this coincides with all our building blocks, in terms of key television and sponsorship contracts, being in place.

'I have agreed with the board to stay not only for the time it takes to appoint a new CEO but also for sufficient additional time after that to see them properly settled in. The board also agreed that, at that stage, I will take up a role as president of international relations which will see me represent the European Tour through the Olympic Games in 2016.'

European Tour chairman David Williams added: 'On behalf of the board and all of the members of the European Tour I would like to thank George for his contribution to the European Tour and professional golf generally over the last 40 years.

'The European Tour and its players are admired throughout the world of golf and George has played a key part in building global relationships and developing the Tour. He has always respected the traditions of the tour and built on the strong foundations put in place by John Jacobs, Neil Coles and Ken Schofield.

'The Tour is now embarking on a new phase in its development and that is why George has considered that it is the right time to ask the nominations committee to find his successor.'

An announcement about the process had been planned for the week of the DP World Tour Championship, but media reports on Tuesday forced the Tour's hand. The Tour said no further comment will be made until the season-ending tournament in Dubai in a fortnight's time.
