An investigation has been launched amid fears nearly 160 cases of Salmonella poisoning across the UK could be linked.

Public Health England (PHE) said it was looking into a national outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis after cases were reported in Hampshire, London, the West Midlands, Cheshire and Merseyside.

The cases occurred in 'isolated clusters' over several months but officials now say they could be potentially linked.

Genetic tests suggest that the cause of illness in the 156 people could have come from a single source, PHE said.

Investigators are working alongside the Food Standards Agency to look into the cause of the outbreak - which may have also affected people in France and Austria.

Dr Paul Cleary, a consultant epidemiologist leading the PHE investigation, said: 'We are working with our colleagues across PHE, at the Food Standards Agency, in local authorities and with other public health organisations in Europe to investigate the cause of this outbreak. 

'We are making good progress and hope to have more conclusive evidence shortly.

'We will continue to monitor the situation and if there is any further public health action necessary then we will ensure that this takes place.'

Across England experts are examining 55 cases in Hampshire, 32 of which have been connected with an oriental restaurant, and 33 cases in Cheshire and Merseyside, 31 of which have been linked to one oriental takeaway.

PHE are also looking at 43 cases in the West Midlands, 34 of which were connected with the Birmingham Heartlands Hospital outbreak. 

Anyone can get salmonella, but young children, the elderly and people whose immune systems are not working properly have a greater risk of becoming severely ill.

Symptoms include watery diarrhoea, stomach cramps and sometimes vomiting and fever.

These symptoms usually last for four to seven days and clear up without treatment, but if you become seriously ill you may need to be treated for dehydration (fluid loss) caused by the illness.

Transmission occurs by eating contaminated food, mainly of animal origin, or by faecal contamination from an infected person or animal.

The Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Birmingham hospital, confirmed the outbreak in June and said four members of staff and 19 patients had tested positive for the common strain of salmonella.

All were suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting – which are typical symptoms of the bug.

PHE also said officials were looking at 25 cases of reported salmonella poisoning in London.

Salmonella Enteritidis is a strain of bacteria that causes gastrointestinal illness and is often linked to poultry or eggs.

Professor Anthony Hilton, head of biological and biomedical science at Aston University, said: 'If the cases are related, the next important stage will be identifying common risk factors which are associated with the infected individuals.

'This might be consumption of a contaminated food or ingredient or even a common exposure at an event or activity.

'Compiling food and exposure histories of cases occurring over several months can be complex and time-consuming, depending on the quality of the information available, and it may be some time before we know the true extent of the outbreak and the causative link, if any.'
