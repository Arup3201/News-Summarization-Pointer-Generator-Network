Police say a California woman was cited after climbing into a giraffe exhibit at a Wisonsin zoo and getting kicked in the face by one of the animals.

A police report from the Madison Police Department says 24-year-old Amanda Hall, of San Luis Obispo, California, 'climbed over one fence and was partially through a second fence that surrounds the giraffe exhibit' at the Henry Vilas Zoo.

The incident took place at about 5:30pm Saturday, police said.

A 2-year-old giraffe named Wally gave Hall a lick, then before turning and kicking her in the face, police said.

'Zoo staff advised that giraffes are capable of killing lions, and that Hall was lucky not to have been more seriously injured,' the report said.

Police said they ticketed Hall for 'Harassment of Zoo Animals' and fined her for $686.

The police report says Hall revealed 'she climbed into the exhibit area because she loves giraffes.'

Dane County said in a release last year that 12-foot-tall Wally is a reticulated giraffe and earlier lived at Illinois' Niabi Zoo.

Wally lives alongside another reticulated giraffe, named Eddie.
