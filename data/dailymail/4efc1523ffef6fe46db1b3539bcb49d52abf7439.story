Two women who accused Lib Dem Lord Rennard of sexual harassment are to call on the Queen to have him stripped of his peerage.

Bridget Harris, a former aide to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, and Alison Goldsworthy, a former Parliamentary candidate, say he should be censured for bringing the House of Lords into disrepute and refusing to apologise.

Ms Harris, whose lawyer Lawrence Davies will petition the Queen, said: ‘The public will not understand why this man, who I regard as a menace, is still allowed to pass laws for this country.

'Disrepute': Lord Rennard's alleged victims claim he has brought the House of Lords into disrepute

'If Westminster is serious about cleaning up its sleazy reputation, politicians like Rennard need to go.’

Lord Rennard was alleged to have molested women. 

A party inquiry found ‘credible’ evidence he had ‘violated’ their personal space, but it could not be proved he had inappropriate or sexual motives.

Last night Lib Dem MEP Chris Davies came to the peer’s defence, tweeting: ‘Clegg’s treatment of Rennard is a disgrace. A good, decent man publicly humiliated.’
