A soldier who lost both his legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan is hoping to become the first double-amputee to walk to the South Pole.

Sergeant Duncan Slater, who was struck by the explosion in the war-torn country in July 2009, has spent the last week training for the challenge in sub-zero temperatures in Iceland.

The 34-year-old, from Muir of Ord in Scotland, is one of six injured servicemen and women hoping to be selected for a four-person British team to compete against teams from America and the Commonwealth in the Walking With The Wounded charity race to the South Pole in November.

High hopes: Sergeant Slater is one of six injured British soldiers hoping to take part in The Walking With The Wounded South Pole Allied Challenge Expedition

Tough: They are currently training in Iceland where temperatures drop to minus 20C and winds reach 50mph

Sergeant Slater was told by doctors he would never walk again after his vehicle was blown up by a Taliban roadside bomb when he was serving with the RAF Regiment.

But the 34-year-old has now learned to ski and is aiming to become a record-breaker by being the first double amputee to ski to the South Pole.

'I volunteered to do this to show what amputees can do," he said after spending five days and nights on Langjokull glacier in Iceland.

'It would be great to see more and more amputees reach the pole.

'Hopefully I won't be the last, and if I get there and find out an easier way of doing it, then other people can follow in my footsteps and do it as well.'

Competition: Three teams are getting ready to take on the South Pole Allied Challenge Expedition

Sergeant Slater has been in Iceland with other wounded men and women from the UK, US, Australia and Canada to familiarise himself with the conditions the teams will face in Antarctica.

They have camped out on the glacial ice, melted snow for water each morning and night and eaten freeze-dried rations.

Sgt Slater said the conditions have been a strain, but he has learned to adapt.

'It's had its challenges to be honest,' he said. 'It's not easy learning to ski and then go out for four days covering quite a lot of mileage. But it's been a great learning curve.'

Asked if he has a particular technique, he added: 'It is a little bit ad hoc, but you've got to find your way of doing it and find a rhythm, but once you do that, it's amazing how much distance you can cover in a day.

Heavy luggage: The wounded servicemen and women from the UK, US, Australia and Canada trekked for more than 15 miles each day dragging sledges, known as pulks, weighing 130lb

Varied: Each team has members with injuries ranging from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to total blindness and gunshot wounds

'You've got to be quite hot on your personal administration. You've got to really look after your stumps.

'The last things you want to do is get any rubs, and blisters, or indeed in these temperatures, any frostbite or injuries like that on them.'

With temperatures in Iceland dropping to minus 20C and winds reaching 50mph, the wounded servicemen and women from the UK, US, Australia and Canada trekked for more than 15 miles each day dragging sledges, known as pulks, weighing 130lb.

They camped out on the ice, melted ice inside their tents and ate freeze-dried rations - exactly what they will do to survive the treacherous Antarctic plateau.

Each team has members with injuries ranging from double leg amputations to post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and total blindness to gunshot wounds.

No easy feat: The challenge involves a 200-mile walk across the southern wilderness

They will face huge challenges on the 200-mile walk in the southern wilderness, which is extremely hazardous even for people without profound physical and mental injury.

The Walking With The Wounded charity successfully reached the North Pole in 2011 in an expedition which Prince Harry joined for five days, and last year an attempt to reach the summit of Mount Everest was called off because conditions on the mountain were too dangerous.

Three teams of four for the South Pole expedition will be picked in the coming weeks.

Sgt Slater, who now lives in Meadowview in Norfolk, will then find out if he has been selected for Team Glenfiddich, the UK team for the Walking With The Wounded South Pole Allied Challenge.
