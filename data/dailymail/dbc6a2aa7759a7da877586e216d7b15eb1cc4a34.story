Long gone are the days when a room with a view was the be all and end all for hotel room guests.

These days they would be just as happy with a room with free wifi, according to a study.

An online survey by travel company ebookers has found that a free room upgrade on arrival is the thing that guests put at the top of their hotel wish lists.

A survey has found that hotel guests would be just as happy with free wifi as they would be with a great view

But in joint second place in the list of items that would make a hotel stay more rewarding were beautiful views from the room and free wifi. 

Customers would rather have a good connection to scroll through social media updates or keep in touch with family and friends instead of other treats such as robes and slippers in the room, airport limo services and complimentary cocktails on arrival.

Based on responses from 2,000 UK adults, the poll also showed that other things that make a holiday more rewarding included good restaurants and fine weather when it was cold at home.

But 20 per cent of those from Cardiff who were surveyed said they had never experienced a rewarding holiday.

Ideally, those polled preferred European destinations, with three in five not keen on having to travel for more than four hours.

And as many as 17 per cent put their pals before their partner, preferring to travel with a friend.
