This is the moment a cat is torn to pieces by a pack of wild dogs still loose on a quiet Kent estate.

Families living in Strood fear a child could be killed next because the animals have already stalked and then mauled seven pets to death.

Police and the council have been called in after the series of attacks by the three dogs with 'unusual markings' but they have still not been traced.

The latest attack was captured on CCTV where the dogs stalked and killed Coco.

Shocking: Two dogs in the pack of wild animals have a tug of war over the body of Coco the cat - one of seven pets to be mauled to death on a quiet Kent estate

Murder: The leader of the pack is shown here on the righht carrying Coco's limp frame away followed by the other dogs, which still haven't been traced by police and the council

The pack is seen running along the pavement before crossing the road after spotting the black cat near its front door.

The dogs then sprint across and play a tug-of-war with its body before the leader ran off with its lifeless body in its mouth.

Parents on the Medway Estate in the north Kent town are now not letting their children out to play on their own because it is a safety risk.

Victim: Beloved pet Coco the cat, pictured in one of its favourite spots at home, is one of seven cats to have been killed on its Strood estate

Bereft: Coco with owner Rik Tye, whose family fear for their children's safety and are not letting them out to play unsupervised

Upset: Mr Tye says he has shown the footage to an animal expert who 'can't pinpoint what these animals are'

Mother-of-five Amanda Tye, 32, owns the cat with husband Rik, 36.

She said: 'Coco jumped out of the way of the smallest of the pack bit her, snapped her neck and brought him over to the other dogs who then started ripping into her.

'I was asleep at the time but my neighbour shouted out of her window.

'He was lying in the road, her face was crumpled. It was heartbreaking.

'If they come back again I'll kill them.' 

'They (the dogs) may well go for a child if they are hungry enough – they pose a big threat.

'Coco was a one in a million cat who we'll miss so much.

'I've had my eldest driving me loopy asking if he can go outside and I have to say that he can't. The only way he's allowed out is if I can see him.' 

Wild: The dogs are seen here sprinting along the pavement in a line before they spot Coco

Mysterious: The dogs with 'unusual markings' have not been found despite three visits by dog wardens

Fears: The dogs keep returning to the street in Stroud, who are frightened about being attacked

Suspicions: Residents fear that the pack of dogs are hidden inside this nature reserve across the road - jumping over the fence to kill cats before returning to their lair

Mr Tye said: 'I showed the video to an animal expert at a local farm and he said they're dangerous.

'Nobody can pinpoint what these animals are.

Another victim? Hanging on the fence of the nature reserve is a poster asking for information on Hermoine, one of a large number of cats to disappear in recent weeks

'They're hyena like things and do not have a face, it's all squished.

'It's a bit disturbing.' 

Coco had been a particular source of comfort to her children, especially eight-year-old Kyal who has autism. They are distraught that the cat has died. 

More worrying footage has emerged of the pack jumping up and smelling the front door of the Tye family home before chasing a cat down the road.

Medway Council told MailOnline that they had sent dog wardens to the estate on three occasions and have been unable to trace the animals. 

A council spokesman said: 'Following reports of this incident community wardens went out on Sunday and twice on Monday to look for the dogs seen in the video.

'They were unable to locate the dogs or their owners'.

Neighbours say they are living in fear of the dogs returning.

Rikki Dunning, 38, who has four children and four cats said: 'It's worrying.

'They hunt in packs and if they can rip a cat apart they could easily attack a little baby.'

Mother-of-four Lorraine Orange, 46, whose husband set-up the camera which captured the shocking footage, is worried about the dogs getting into her back garden.

She said: 'They probably won't think twice about jumping over my fence and getting to my guinea pigs and dogs in my back garden.

'People in the estate are worried about letting their kids out.'

Her husband Steven Orange, 44, added: 'Until we've heard the dogs have moved on we don't know where we stand.

'The dogs could creep up on a child.

'There's a fence next to a large nature reserve which has holes in it and that's probably where they're coming in through.'

Street in shock: This is the spot where Coco had its neck broken by the 'faceless' wild animals

Cat lovers: Rikki Dunning and partner Kathy Hicks have 5 cats and are also worried the wild animals will attack them while Steven Orange and Lorraine Orange put up the camera that showed the animals attacking Coco

There have been several reports of cats going missing around the estate.

Tortoiseshell cat Hermione went missing from her owner's flat opposite the nature reserve a month ago.

Julie Keeble, 38, the owner’s wife put up signs appealing for help to find the moggy, fears it may be linked.

She said: 'We thought she might have been poisoned but there's a possibility it could be something to do with these dog attacks.

'I haven't heard or seen these dogs but there used to be so many cats next to the nature reserve. It's strange.'

Earlier this week ginger cat fur was spotted in the same road, sparking fears the rabid dogs had struck again.
