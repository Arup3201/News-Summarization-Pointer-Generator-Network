A 26-year-old woman and her two housemates - one of which she was said to be having an affair with - were sitting inside the Burger King restaurant where they work while allegedly concocting a plan to murder the woman's husband at a Pennsylvania park.

However the intricate Christmas Eve plot, which included removing the man's teeth and setting his body on fire so it would be harder to identify, was thwarted when a park worker stumbled upon the three with their bleeding intended victim, according to The Post-Gazette.

Kimberly Thompkins, 26, Daryith Stevens, 18, and Robert Crosby, 24, are now being held on charges of attempted homicide, conspiracy to commit homicide, conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and aggravated assault.

Kimberly Thompkins, 26, is being held on a variety of charges, including conspiracy to commit homicide, after allegedly hatching a plan to kill her husband and father of her children, Adam Thompkins, 29. The pair were married in 2006

Alleged accomplices: Daryith Stevens, 18 (left), and Robert Crosby, 24 (right), are the housemates and Burger King co-workers of Kimberly Thompkins. Together the trio are alleged to have conspired to kill Adam Thompkins, who owns the house they live in

Victim: Adam Thompkins, seen here in a Facebook photo with one of his children, was stabbed and beaten in a brutal attack on Christmas Eve by three assailants. He has since been released from hospital

The alleged murder plot was hatched inside this Burger King in Rostraver, where the three suspects work. Co-workers say they sat in the first booth on Monday and were talking intently. On Tuesday, Christmas Eve, the plan was put into play

Thompkins was believed to have been having an affair with Crosby and allegedly hatched the plan to kill her husband, 29-year-old Adam Thompkins.

The two were married in 2006 and, according to their Facebook photo albums, appear to have three children together.

All four adults lived in a house on Eureka Hill Road in Jacobs Creek, a section of South Hampton, which was bought by Mr Thompkins two years ago, records show.

On Monday the trio met at the Rotraver Burger King where they work and 'conspired to kill Adam Thompkins', according to an affidavit of probable cause.

Police say that on Christmas Eve morning, Ms Thompkins drove her husband to Cedar Creek Park to discuss their marital problems.

However when they arrived, the other two alleged accomplices were waiting in a separate car, with the three allegedly proceeding to stab and beat Mr Thompkins.

The trio brought a gas can 'to burn the victimâ€™s body after he was killed', according to the affidavit.

The three suspects, who have been remanded in custody, lived together in this house that victim Adam Thompkins bought two years ago in Jacobs Creek, a section of South Hampton

Ms. Stevens also brought 'a change of clothes and pliers to pull the victimâ€™s teeth so he could not be identified,' police wrote.

But around 11.15am, before the plan could be completed, park crew leader Frank Backstrom, 52, passed through the area and noticed a man 'bleeding pretty good from the head'.

Mr Backstrom approached the group and Mr Crosby told him the man had fallen and that they were taking him to the hospital.

Mr Backstrom then left but, worried something was amiss, returned to the area shortly after and found a bloody three-inch blade.

He then called police.

Park Patrolman Edward Bricker then found the group at another section of the park, noting in the affidavit that Mr Thompkins was 'covered in blood' with wounds to his head and was unable to speak.

Police were able to catch the alleged trio at Cedar Creek Park in Rostraver before their plan could be fully executed

He was flown by helicopter to Allegheny General Hospital.

The three suspects were interviewed at the park separately by police by 'all gave conflicting statements', police said.

The trio were arrested and remain in the Westmoreland County Prison, with a preliminary hearing set for January 6.

Mr Thompkins was released from hospital on Wednesday and is working with police.
