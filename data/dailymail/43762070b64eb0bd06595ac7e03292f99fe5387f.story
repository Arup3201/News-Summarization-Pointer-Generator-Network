Even if you’re full to bursting point this Christmas, expect angry glares from your host if you leave so much as a Brussels sprout uneaten on your plate.

That’s because the cost of the average Christmas lunch for six has soared by more than 10 per cent above the rate of inflation since last year to reach £93.

Prices for 25 festive items, along with the cost of the cheapest turkey from Asda, Sainsbury’s and Tesco, were analysed for a survey.

Finish your dinner: Due to the soaring costs of Christmas dinners at more than 10 per cent over inflation, there may be an increase in arguments as well

Supermarkets have blamed wet weather and higher demands from suppliers for the rising cost of a traditional turkey dinner.

The price of an average 9lb turkey has risen from £51.40 last year to £55, while the average price for a pack of six mince pies has risen from £1.17 to £1.43.

The difference was even more pronounced at Sainsbury’s where a pack was £1 in 2011 but £1.65 this year.

The survey also found that the price of vegetables has shot up this year due to the wet summer.

A poor Brussels sprout harvest means prices are expected to rise 42 per cent, while the cost of potatoes has increased by just under a quarter, according to the Sunday Times survey.

Paul Kelly, of the British Poultry Council, said he thought turkey prices would rise by 7 per cent on average.

He added: ‘If you really want value, buy a whole turkey. You’ll get nicer meat, nicer stock and a better eating experience, and the butcher won’t have to throw all that meat away.’

Inevitably, the price of presents and cards is also set to rise.

Last year, the top Christmas gift on Amazon was the Kindle ebook reader, for £89. However, this year’s updated version, the Kindle Fire, will set shoppers back £129.

The average pack of 12 Christmas cards will cost £3 this year, up 25p from last year. But the price of posting them has risen dramatically, with first-class stamps for 80 cards costing £48 – up £11.20 on last year.

But it’s not all bad news – the price of a Christmas tree will stay the same, with a 6ft Nordmann fir for about £50.

And the Toy Retailers Association’s ‘Dream List’ of the most popular toys has seen an average price drop of 3p on the price of last year’s. This year Furby, the furry electronic owl, and InnoTab 2, a tablet computer for children, are expected to top the list.

Since publication of this article, we have been informed that this offer did not in fact begin until November 30.
