Kidnapping victim Amanda Berry's father has spoken about his daughter's reaction to Ariel Castro's suicide for the first time, saying that she is 'relieved that the monster is dead'.

Before his death, Berry fought to insure that he would not have legal visitation rights to see Jocelyn, the six-year-old daughter that she gave birth to while being held by Castro.

Her father Johnny Berry said that she 'has been living in constant fear that Jocelyn may someday have to see Castro, and she didn’t want that ever to happen'.

Her thoughts were revealed just hours after two corrections officers who were in charge of watching Castro were put on paid leave following the incident.

Suicide: The two corrections officers who were guarding Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro have been placed on administrative leave following his death on their watch at the Ohio prison

The end: Castro acknowledged in court last month that he would die in prison

Survivor: Amanda Berry and two other young women were kidnapped and held by Castro for over a decade

Department of Rehabilitation and 
Correction spokeswoman JoEllen Smith says the two guards Caleb Ackley, 
26, and 27-year-old Ryan Murphy were on duty in the Orient, Ohio prison 
unit where Castro hanged himself on September 3.

The
two men are on paid administrative leave until internal investigations 
by the department and a criminal investigation by the state highway 
patrol are completed. Neither have any previous disciplinary notes in 
their files.

The three women
who Castro kept locked up for over a decade have kept mum following his
suicide, but Mr Berry's comments makes the residual anger clear.

He
told The National Enquirer that the only thing about Castro's suicide 
that upset him was 'that I wanted to kill that b****** myself'.

'I
thought that maybe he got killed — animals like him get taken out all 
the time in the prison system,' Mr Berry said about when he first heard 
the news.

'But I’m glad he’s dead. I hope he died real slow.'

The officers haven't been found guilty of
any wrong doing but are on leave pending the review board's decision, 
according to 19 Action News.

Messages were left for the union representing prison guards. There was no response from Mr Ackley when contacted by MailOnline.

The 53-year-old Castro hanged himself with a bed sheet earlier this 
month, a few weeks into a life sentence for imprisoning three women in his home for a decade.

Castro was serving a life sentence plus 1,000 years for abducting, raping, and holding hostage Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus.

Castro was being housed alone in an 
isolation unit for his protection, where he would be checked every 30 
minutes.  Prison officials said he hanged himself with a sheet during a 
break between inspections.

being kidnapped, raped and tortured by Castro. They have declined to 
comment on his suicide

Initially, Castro was being checked on every ten minutes, but this stopped in June after he was deemed not to be a risk to himself and taken off suicide watch.

An autopsy confirmed his death was suicide by hanging.

Castro's attorneys tried 
unsuccessfully to have an independent psychological examination of the 
53-year-old done at the Cuyahoga County Jail before he was turned over 
to state authorities following his conviction.

A
full investigation is underway as to how he was able to take his own 
life while under the watchful eye of prison guards - who said he was 
always calm and cooperative with them.

House of horrors: This is the four-bedroom home where Castro kept his victims for a decade - unbeknown to his family or his neighbors
