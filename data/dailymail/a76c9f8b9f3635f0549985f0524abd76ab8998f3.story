All three NFL games in London next season will have early afternoon kick-offs in the UK, meaning fans back in the US will have to get up early to watch.

The NFL announced on Thursday that the November 1 game between the Detroit Lions and Kansas City Chiefs at Wembley Stadium will start at 2:30pm local time - 9:30am on the US East Coast.

Early kickoffs had already been announced for the October 4 game between the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins (2:30 pm local; 9:30 am EDT) and the October 25 game between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars (1:30pm local; 9:30am EDT).

The first NFL game at Wembley played with an early afternoon kickoff was this season's game between the Lions and Atlanta Falcons on October 26. All other London games had kicked off in the early evening, translating to a 1pm start in the US.

NFL UK managing director Alistair Kirkwood says 'our fan research has shown overwhelming support for early kickoffs.'

The timing also allows the teams to fly home later the same day to begin their bye weeks.
