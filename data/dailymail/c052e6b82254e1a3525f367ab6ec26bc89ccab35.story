Pictures of the Shetland skeleton taken before a landslide covered it. Researcher also took a bone sample which will now be analysed

A series of storms on Scotland's Shetland Islands temporarily revealed what archaeologists believe could be a pair of 2,000-year-old skeletons.

Police were initially called to the scene on December 16th when storms eroded a cliff at Channerwick, exposing the human remains.

Local archaeologist Chris Dyer said the ancient skeleton looked as if it were the same age as the remains of Iron Age structures revealed nearby. 

Researchers then identified evidence 
of one or possibly two more burials at the site, but another storm 
caused a further chunk of the cliff to crumble, covering up the 
discovery.

'The original burial now lies under 
several tons of fallen bank, and the Iron Age structures have also 
disappeared from view,' Dyer said.

'However, a small piece of bone will be sent for radiocarbon dating and 
it will be possible to determine whether or not the remains are about 
2,000 years old, as we suspect.'

Archaeologist Val Turner added 
that during the investigation she and freelance colleague Samantha 
Dennis discovered evidence of at least one, and possibly two other 
burials.

Turner
also told the Shetland News that the force 10 easterly storms on 16th December had damaged archaeological sites
along the entire east coast of Shetland.

In South Nesting as much as a metre has been lost of an Iron Age site at Gletness.

And a Viking site above the beach at 
the Easting on Unst, originally excavated and consolidated by the Unst 
Archaeology Group and Glasgow University, has been partially lost to the
sea.

'We are fortunate to have a record of 
these sites as a result of earlier work but coastal erosion is an ever 
present feature of archaeology in Shetland,' she said.

'Shetland Amenity Trust’s archaeology 
section would be keen to hear from anyone who knows of other sites which
may have appeared or been eroded by the storms.

'We are hoping that once we have an 
indication of just how great a problem has been created in the last few 
weeks, we will be able to formulate an action plan.'
