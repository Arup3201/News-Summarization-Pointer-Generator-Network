He succeeded where both Kris Boyd and Kenny Miller have so far failed by grabbing a first competitive goal of the season.

And after coming off the bench to notch the killer second in an unconvincing 2-0 win at Falkirk on Friday night, Nicky Clark vowed he is ready to step in for the injured Miller who limped off with a tight hamstring at Westfield and will miss Monday night’s Petrofac Training Cup clash with Barry Ferguson’s Clyde at Ibrox.

‘Hopefully Kenny Miller is all right because he is a massive player for us,’ said Clark. ‘He also has great experience to give to the team. But if he is going to be out then it is a chance for me to come into the team and do well.

‘And I was pleased with my performance when I got on. I felt I got in behind Falkirk, I turned their defence and in the end I grabbed a goal.’

However, Clark nearly found himself cast in the role of villain when, with the score still goalless, he headed a great chance from six yards straight at Falkirk keeper Jamie McDonald.

After Lewis Macleod put Rangers ahead with a wickedly deflected shot, Clark made amends by applying the finishing touch to a shot from Nicky Law that already looked net-bound.

‘I needed to do better with that header I missed,’ nodded Clark. ‘I just tried to go back across goal with it and their keeper has saved the ball. But luckily enough I’ve got another chance and scored it.

‘Nicky Law hasn’t said anything to me about stealing his goal bonus! I wasn’t even sure his shot was going in. Anyway it’s my job as a striker to score goals and that’s what I’ve done tonight. I had to put the ball in the net.’

Clark admitted Rangers flattered to deceive for large spells. With a return to the Premiership the ultimate goal, however, the former Queen of the South striker says points are more valuable than performances.

‘It was a relief when the first goal went in, yes. I felt we huffed and puffed at the start of the match but the longer the game went on the more we came into it.

‘We created a few chances, and we maybe got a bit lucky with the first goal that went in via a deflection from Lewis Macleod. But getting three points is the most important thing. Yes it would be nice to go out and play attractive, attacking football but teams come and stop you from doing that. So we will take it even if we have to win ugly.

‘I think it’s going to be tough like this every week in the Championship. There are teams like Hearts and Hibs - and Falkirk proved they are a very good side, too. So are Queen of the South and Livingston.

‘It’s a massive step up from Leagues One and Two because there are only two or three teams who aren’t full time. We’ve been used to playing part-time teams so the fitness levels of the opposition will be much higher. But that’s something we will have to deal with.’

Challenge: Clark says it is a 'massive step up from Leagues One and Two' and it will be tough for Rangers
