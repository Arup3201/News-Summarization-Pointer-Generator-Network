A gunman who killed seven people during a rampage through his Ohio neighbourhood has been described as 'quiet and strange'.

Michael Hance, 51, died in a shootout with police in Copley, Ohio, after the killing spree on Sunday, where he shot seven people dead, including his girlfriend's 11-year-old nephew.

Robin Hancock, a carer for a couple slain in the rampage, went to the police station in Copley on Monday to hear updates on the killings and the identification of Hance as the gunman.

Ms Hancock, 53, of Akron, told CBS news: 'He was quiet and strange.'

The gunman was also described as 'unpleasant' and 'disliked'.

Hance had become increasingly belligerent over residents' comments about the state of the property he lived in with his girlfriend of two decades, Becky Dieter.

His neighbour Carol Eshleman said Hance had been asked to clean up his property by another resident, Gudrun 'Gerdie' Johnson, around a month ago, but he had thrown her off his property.

He began gunning people down after Miss Dieter's family had visited the couple to try and settle a dispute over the property.

The bitter row is thought to have begun after the deaths of Ms Dieter's parents two years ago, neighbours claimed.

Miss Dieter's brother Craig wanted to sell the house, but instead Hance and Miss Dieter moved in.

Craig Dieter and his wife Beth had driven to Copley from their home in Walton, Kentucky, to go over the estate.

They were visiting the Johnsons when Hance opened fire.

Mrs Johnson, 64, was killed in the attack, along with her husband Russell, 67.

Their 44-year-old son Bryan Johnson and his daughter Autumn, 16, were also shot dead.

Miss Dieter's brother Craig, and his 11-year-old son, Scott, and an unidentified girl who was shot in a parked car with Autumn were the other victims.

Scott Dieter was shot in the basement of a third house where he had apparently sought refuge after fleeing through a swamp to get away from the gunman.

Miss Dieter, Hance's long-time girlfriend, was also shot but survived and remains in hospital.
