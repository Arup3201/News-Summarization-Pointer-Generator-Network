 As the US government shutdown enters its ninth day the closure is threatening to leave America’s craft brewers nursing a serious hangover.

While stores across the country will continue to stock a range of beers and ales on their shelves, the shutdown has closed an obscure agency, which quietly approves new breweries, recipes and labels.

Its closure could halt the rapidly growing craft industry in its tracks, creating huge delays for customers who expect a constant supply of inventive and seasonal beers.

At risk: Mike Brenner, owner of Brenner Brewing in Milwaukee, said the US government shutdown could halt his plans to open a new craft brewery in December. He claims the federal closure will cost him $8,000 a month

The federal government shutdown began on October 1 after a group of House Republican lawmakers blocked a budget deal in a last-ditch effort to stop funding for President Barack Obama’s health care law.

Mike Brenner is trying to open a craft brewery in Milwaukee in December. 

His application to include a tasting room is now on hold, as are his plans to file paperwork for four new labels over the coming weeks. He risks losing around $8,000 for every month his opening is delayed.

‘My dream, this is six years in the making, is to open this brewery,’ he said. ‘I've been working so hard, and I find all these great investors. And now I can't get started because people are fighting over this or that in Washington.

‘This is something people don't mess around with. Even in a bad economy, people drink beer.’

He said politicians do not seem to care how much damage they are causing.

‘For them it’s just another day,' he added. 'They are still getting paid, but I’m losing $8,000 a month.’ 

Shut: The closure of The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau means Mr Brenner's application to open his new brewery, to include a tasting room, is now on hold as are plans to file paperwork for four new brews

Concerned: Matt Krajnak, spokesman for Lakefront Brewery in Milwaukee, said: 'Right now, it's only been a week so it's not too bad. Two weeks, three weeks is when we're really going to start sweating here.'

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is a little-known arm of the Treasury Department. While the agency will continue to process taxes from existing permit holders during the shutdown, applications for anything new are in limbo.

What will happen during the shutdown?

All non-essential government services close and their staff are put on unpaid leave. More than 80 per cent of staff at bodies such as Nasa and the Environmental Protection Agency will be 'furloughed', but courts, the military and veterans' affairs will remain functioning almost as normal. National parks and government-funded museums such as the Smithsonian will be closed. Social Security pension payments and the 'Obamacare' health reforms will not be affected, because they are funded separately.

What is the economic effect?The shutdown is predicted to cost the American economy more than $1billion a day, according to Goldman Sachs, thanks to the drop in output caused by federal workers staying at home, and the loss of tourism.Why should people outside the U.S. care?Visa applications are expected to be delayed because consulate staff will not be paid, while officials currently involved in international trade negotiations will have to break off from talks. Stock markets around the world fell on news of the shutdown. Even more worryingly, the deadlock in Washington makes it less likely that politicians will be able to strike a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling later this month - if the world's biggest economy is forced to default on its debts, the world could be plunged into the worst economic crisis since the collapse of Lehman Brothers.

Paul Gatza, director of the Brewers Association, which represents more than 1,900 US breweries, said: ‘One could think of this shutdown as basically stopping business indefinitely for anyone who didn't have certain paperwork in place back in mid-August.’

A woman who answered the phone on October 2 at TTB’s headquarters in Washington abruptly hung up on Associated Press after explaining the government was shutdown. Assistant Administrator Cheri Mitchell did not respond to telephone or email messages.

A message on the bureau’s website warns: ‘Due to the government shutdown, information on this website is available, but may not be up to date.'

The closing is not expected to have much effect on America’s industry giants, including MillerCoors and Anheuser-Busch, who can continue to produce existing products as normal.

But the shutdown poses a huge problem for smaller, craft brewers who build their business by producing quirky, unusual flavours and introducing new seasonal beers.

Prior to the shutdown craft brewers claim the TTB was taking up to 75 days to approve applications. Now they are bracing themselves for longer delays.

The impact has provoked anger among smaller producers. Tony Magee, owner of Lagunitas Brewing Co. in Petaluma, near San Francisco in California took to Twitter to air his annoyance.

‘(Expletive) Feds are gonna shut down the already incompetent Gov while hundreds of small breweries, including us, have labels pending. Nice.’ That was followed by: ‘Wanna regulate? Perform or get out of the way.’

Lagunitas Chief Operating Officer Todd Stevenson called the TTB shutdown a ‘headache’.

He said the company was planning to submit an application to package its autumn seasonal Hairy Eyeball in 22-ounce bottles instead of 12-ounce bottles but can't move forward.

‘It's just aggravating,’ he said. ‘It is frustrating that government can't do its job. Doing what they're doing now is unprecedented.’

Bryan Simpson, a spokesman for New Belgium Brewing in Fort Collins, Colo., said his brewery has three recipes and five new labels awaiting approval. 

The company is especially worried that the release of its new spring label, Spring Blonde, could get pushed back. 

More delays might force New Belgium to shell out extra money to speed up the label printing and rush the beer to market, he said.

Mr Simpson said: ‘Everybody is frustrated in general. The whole way this has played out has been disappointing for the entire country.’

Lakefront Brewery in Milwaukee has applications pending for new packaging of its IBA dark ale and for permission to offer a sour cherry dark lager called John, a brewery employee's own concoction.

The brewery hopes to launch the IBA packaging in November and John in December, but plans are on hold.

‘If the shutdown causes delays, the brewery will probably have to rush the beers to market,’ he said.

‘If we lose that first month, we lose out on a good chunk of money,’ brewery spokesman Matt Karjnak said. ‘Right now, it’s only been a week so it’s not too bad. 

‘Two weeks, three weeks is when we’re really going to start sweating here.’

President Barack Obama is locked in a budget battle with the Republicans

The shutdown of the US government began on October 1 after the two houses of Congress failed to agree a new budget.

President Barack Obama is locked in a battle with the Republicans, who insisted they would not pass a bill to fund the government unless Democrats agreed to delay the President’s signature healthcare reforms by a year.

The White House ordered non-essential services to stop operating shortly before midnight local time on October 1 - the first shutdown for more than 17 years.

The US Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, refused to negotiate with the Republican-dominated House of Representatives over ‘Obamacare’, which requires every American to buy health insurance or pay a fine.

The lack of compromise means that nearly a million federal workers are on unpaid leave until the two legislative bodies come to an agreement.

On Tuesday President Obama opened a new chapter in the shutdown stand-off by announcing the Democrats are ‘willing to pass, at least, a short-term budget’.

But he added he won’t bargain, negotiate or otherwise strike a deal on extending America’s $16.7trillion debt ceiling.

Hours later, House Speaker John Boehner said that Obama's offer won't do.

'The long and short of it is: There's going to be a negotiation here,' Boehner said, referring to the more daunting debt limit fight.

'We can't raise the debt ceiling without doing something about what's driving us to borrow more money and to live beyond our means. The idea that we should continue to spend money that we don't have, and give the bill to our kids and our grandkids would be wrong.'

Obama had insisted that he would force Republicans to negotiate with him in good faith, but only on the budget.

'I think what has changed,' he told reporters, 'is they're aware of the fact that I'm not budging when it comes to the full faith and credit of the United States, that that has to be dealt with.'

The president said he was open to a second sit-down meeting with House and Senate leaders. 'I'll even spring for dinner again,' he said.

'But I'm not going to do it until the more extreme parts of the Republican party stop forcing John Boehner to issue threats about our economy. We can't make extortion routine as part of our democracy.'

Boehner, however, dismissed Obama's terms.

'The president's position that, "Listen, we're not going to sit down and talk to you until you surrender" is just not sustainable,' the Ohio Republican said. 'It's not our system of government.'
