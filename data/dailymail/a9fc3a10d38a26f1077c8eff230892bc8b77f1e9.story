The trial of a 25-year-old Maine mother who allegedly drugged and smothered her young daughter to death in June 2013 began Monday.

Defendant Leanna Norris pleaded not guilty to intentional or knowing murder in 2013, and in September entered a not guilty by reason of insanity plea, Bangor Daily News reported.

Martha Harris, who is representing Norris, told the courtroom that her client  was depressed and had both anxiety and mood disorders last year, according to the newspaper.

Though Harris had also said Norris wasn't at fault, Assistant Attorney General Deb Cashman said Norris knowingly committed the murder.

'She did not want Mike dating other women and did not want them mothering her child,' she reportedly said.

Testimony: Assistant Attorney General Deb Cashman said Norris knowingly committed the murder and 'did not want Mike dating other women and did not want them mothering her child' 

Norris' ex-boyfriend Michael Grenda, who was the father to two-year-old Loh Grenda, testified Monday about the parents' estranged relationship, according to the newspaper. 

His testimony reportedly included that the couple's verbal disputes led to police being dispatched on multiple occasions -- and though Grenda broke up with Norris on June 16, 2013, the two agreed to stay and parent in the same residence.

Norris' digital communications with different men stopped a potential reunion, he also said, according to Bangor Daily News.

Grenda reportedly recounted his telling Norris on June 23 'that was the end of everything' - and then 'She became very upset. She was crying and smashing her head against the wall.'

The 27-year-old's testimony also reportedly revealed that Norris cooled off that morning through his help, he left the home in the afternoon, and found out what happened to Loh Grenda on June 24.

Steven Norris, the alleged murderer's father, testified though he and Leana Norris spent Father's Day and her June 18 birthday together, she had been unresponsive with her cell phone for several days before receiving a text message from her, Bangor Daily News reported.

According to the newspaper, he recalled Monday that he received a a 2.27am phone call on June 24 from Leanna Norris, in which she admitted to killing her daughter.

He also reportedly described how he contacted authorities as Leanna Norris' mother was on the phone with her, and Leanna Norris showed up at her parents' house and her daughter was dead inside the car.

Leanna Norris was suicidal at her parent's house and wanted a gun, her father also reportedly testified.

Bangor Daily News earlier reported that Leanna Norris was arrested last year after Loh Grenda's body was found in the front seat of her car in Stetson, Maine, on June 24, 2013.

According to the newspaper, her affidavit by Maine State Police Detective Thomas Pickering  said she offered 'two or three syringes of Benadryl to make [Loh Grenda] go to sleep.'

'Leanna Norris put black Gorilla [duct] tape on Loh Grenda’s mouth and nose; that Leanna Norris put a blanket over Loh Grenda’s face so she would not have to look at Loh’s eyes,' the affidavit reportedly said. ' Leanna Norris said that she killed Loh Grenda; that Leanna Norris put her hand over Loh Grenda’s face and suffocated her.'

Norris said she took the tape off 'so it would not look so horrible', the affidavit is said to reveal.

Later at a Stetson cemetery was 'where [Leanna Norris] took pills and put tape on her face in order to kill herself,' the affidavit also reportedly said.

But, after vomiting, the 24-year-old allegedly called her father, Steven Norris, and then drove to his house, where he discovered his granddaughter dead under a blanket.
