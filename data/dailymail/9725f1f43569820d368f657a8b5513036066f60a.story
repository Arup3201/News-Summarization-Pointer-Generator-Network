This little mouse was relying on a wing and a prayer if it thought it could outrun this predator.

These stunning images capture the exact moment a majestic Northern Hawk Owl descended and captured the tiny rodent.

The pictures were taken by photographer Roman Lobanov, who endured sub-zero temperatures in Rybinsk, Russia, to catch the predator in action.

Mr Lobanov said he waited for hours in the cold before he spotted this owl.

The pictures show the hungry owl hovering in the air when it first sees its prey before swooping on the unlucky rodent.

The mouse tries to escape but is no match for the bird, which catches it in its talons and flies away with it.

Mr Lobanov, 40, from Peresvet in Russia, said it was taking the photographs was a trial.

He said: 'It was extremely difficult to get these shots.

'It was really very cold, about -32 degrees and of course I had to be very patient.

'I waited several hours to capture this moment and it's extremely difficult to get such a sharp sequence when everything is moving so quickly.'

Northern Hawk Owls are found in Russia, as well as across North America and also in Britain and Scandinavia.

They have a wingspan of up to 45cm and eat small rodents and birds.

Mr Lobanov said the mouse did not realised it was being hunted until it was too late and its speed almost caught him by surprise as well.

He said: 'The owl was fantastically quick and of course there was also an element of luck involved.

'Owls are almost silent in flight so the poor mouse didn't really stand a chance.'
