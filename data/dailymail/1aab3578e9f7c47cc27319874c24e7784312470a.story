An impatient commuter probably regretted  telling a man to 'f*** himself' on a busy train when he arrived at a job interview later that day to find his fellow passenger was the head of recruitment.

HR executive Matt Buckland claimed the job seeker pushed past him and launched a foul-mouthed tirade as they were both getting off a packed rush-hour train on Monday morning.

He said he stood to one side to let a woman off the train as it pulled into Monument Station in central London, but the job hunter thought he was deliberately standing in the way.

Hours later, the same man walked in for an interview with Mr Buckland at investment firm Forward Partners. 

HR executive Matt Buckland found himself interviewing the same man who launched a foul-mouthed tirade at him earlier the same day

'I was on my way into work on the Tube on Monday morning during rush hour. I stood to one side to let a lady get by, and ended up blocking a man momentarily.

'I think he thought I was just standing in his way. He pushed and I turned, I explained I was getting off too but he pushed past and then looked back and suggested I might like to f*** myself…which might have been true but not before a few cups of coffee,' he told Buzzfeed.

Despite the heated exchange, the job seeker did not recognise his interviewer as soon as he arrived.

So Mr Buckland asked him a few tube-related questions until the penny dropped.

He then shared the awkward encounter on Twitter and his original tweet has been favourited 14,000 times and re-tweeted more than 15,000 times.

'Karma - the guy who pushed past me on the tube and then suggested I go F myself just arrived for his interview...with me..' he tweeted.

He then said: 'I'm not sure he realised until the very end... very awkward! 

Mr Buckland had stood to one side to let a woman off the train as it pulled into Monument Station in central London, but the job hunter thought he was deliberately standing in the way and shouted at him

'I think it crept up on him slowly as my questions became more and more tube related.' 

The job seeker 'laughed it off' and carried on with the interview for the role of web developer at the firm.

But he was not offered the job as Mr Buckland said he was not right for the role. 

'It would be easy to hold something like this over someone in an interview, but for me interviews aren't about that,' said Mr Buckland.

'By the end of the interview we laughed it off and we're both happy.'

'When you interview you are looking for a read of skills but also to know if that person is a real human being, it's about that connection.By the end of the interview we laughed it off and were both happy.

'The candidate didn't get the job, though, and maybe now he'll maintain a better attitude in the morning since he just might need some help from a fellow commuter one day.'
