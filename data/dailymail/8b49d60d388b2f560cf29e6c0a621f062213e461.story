President Barack Obama on Sunday urged Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to an 'immediate, unconditional humanitarian ceasefire' with Hamas.

The White House says Obama expressed 'strong condemnation' of Hamas' attacks on Israel and again supported Israel's right to defend herself but implored Netanyahu to abide by a permanent ceasefire between his country and the terrorist group.

Obama's call with the the world leader followed Israel's rejection on Friday of a new ceasefire agreement with Hamas negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.

Afterward, an Israeli news report quoted 'voices' from the latter leader's cabinet describing Kerry as 'completely capitulating' to Hamas and 'negligent,' and a top Israeli journalist compared Kerry to a space alien - characterizations that had the Obama administration 'fuming' on Monday, according to the Associated Press.

The White House is none too happy with deprecating comments made over the weekend by Israeli ministers about Secretary of State John Kerry's negotiating skills

In a post on liberal news publication Haaretz's website over the weekend, diplomatic correspondent Barack Ravid said Kerry did more to 'thwart the possibility of reaching a cease-fire in Gaza' than he did to promote one.

He went on to say Kerry would be 'responsible for every additional drop of blood that is spilled' if his actions resulted in an escalation of Israeli military aggression.

'Kerry isn’t anti-Israeli; on the contrary, he’s a true friend to Israel,' Ravid wrote. 'But his conduct in recent days over the Gaza cease-fire raises serious doubts over his judgment and perception of regional events.

'It’s as if he isn’t the foreign minister of the world’s most powerful nation, but an alien, who just disembarked his spaceship in the Mideast.'

Fighting resumed between Israel and Hamas on Sunday morning as the clock ran out on a temporary ceasefire that put the nearly three weeks old armed conflict on hold for a half day.

Appearing on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday morning, Netanyahu reaffirmed his country's refusal of Hamas' ultimatum and chastised his enemies' violation of previously agreed upon ceasefires.

'Israel is doing what any country would do, and certainly what the U.S. would do,' Netanyahu said.

The White House says Obama called the Israeli Prime Minster that afternoon and told him 'ultimately' a long-term solution 'must ensure the disarmament
 of terrorist groups and the demilitarization of Gaza.'

However, the White House says Obama shared the administration's 'serious and growing concern about the rising number of Palestinian civilian deaths and the loss of Israeli lives, as well as the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza.'

As of Sunday, more than a thousand Palestinians had been killed in the conflict and up to 6,000 others had been injured, according to AP. Nearly four dozen Israeli soldiers and three civilians and three civilians have also been killed.

In excerpts of an interview with Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal that aired on CBS on Sunday and Monday, Meshaal told Charlie Rose that  'the world has two choices' - to help Hamas 'peacefully' remove Israel from the West Bank and the Gaza strip or 'we will expel this occupation from our land.'

'We are not fanatics. We are not fundamentalists. We do not, actually, fight the Jews because they are Jews per se - we fight the occupiers,' he said.

Hamas will keep fighting the 'occupiers,' he said, until it is victorious.

'I can die because of Israel. I cannot live under the occupation. The occupation is the worst thing that you can ever imagine,' he said. 'So every single Palestinian can die for the next generations to live in peace and freedom.'

Mashaal danced around whether Hamas would 'coexist with the state of Israel' if Palestine had its own state before telling Rose, 'When we have a Palestinian state, then the Palestinian state will decide on its policies,' adding that the 'Palestinian people can have their say, when they have their own state, without occupation.'

United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said today that both Netanyahu and Mashaal were 'morally wrong' for allowing the death and destruction to continue and the two men need to show 'compassionate leadership' by ending the armed conflict.

He joined Obama and the U.N. Security Council in calling for 'an immediate and unconditional humanitarian cease-fire,' saying that 'Gaza is in critical condition.'

Ban also said Israel's retaliation against Hamas raises 'serious questions about proportionality.'

His statement follows a U.N. Human Rights Council resolution last week approving an international investigation into Israel for potential war crimes in Gaza.

U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican, said on Sunday that he would 'condemn' the report because it places the blame for the conflict on Israel.

'The U.N. Human Rights report is a joke,' Graham said in comments reported by Politico. 'The U.N. is becoming anti-Israeli, anti-Semitic.' 

Will they ever forgive him?: One Israeli journalist compared Kerry to a space alien after he failed to successfully negotiate a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas last week

Throughout Israel it was Secretary Kerry who was the subject of mockery in weekend commentary.

Maariv columnist Ben Caspit called Kerry 'an ongoing embarrassment, with the characteristics of a snowball.'

'The further he rolls, the greater the embarrassment,' Caspit said.

Israeli TV reporter Udi Segal ran a report citing government officials who framed Kerry as 'incapable of handling the most basic matters.'

The Associated Press said Monday that Obama administration officials said on background that by ridiculing Kerry, Israeli ministers 'crossed a line' and relations between Israel and the U.S. may never be as close as it once was as a result.

In on the record comments Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken came to Kerry's defense.

'Israel has no better friend, no stronger defender than John Kerry,' he told AP.

The comments about Kerry are 'people leaking things that are either misinformed, or attempting to misinform,' he claimed.
