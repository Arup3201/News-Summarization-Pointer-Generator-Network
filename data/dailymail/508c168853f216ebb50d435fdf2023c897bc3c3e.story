The 34 year old had to break the news to his two eldest daughters Shaylah, 7, and Makaylah, 5, but it will be some time before he has to explain to his youngest, two year old Indianah and five month old Zaharah, their mother died tragically.

The rugby league club, the East Woy Woy Roosters, where Mr Jackson is a long time member, have thrown their support behind the grieving father.

Football manager Frank 'Junior' Johnson says the club is stunned and saddened by Lauren's passing.

'He also hasn't got a car at the moment so all the football boys have chipped in. We have all (the club) rallied together and Central Coast rugby league are also letting us pass around buckets on the weekend to help raise funds to help a mate out.'
