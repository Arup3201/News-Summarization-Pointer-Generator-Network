A cyclist claims he was warned by police he could face an assault charge after he saw a driver throw litter out of his car so threw it back through his window.

The rider filmed the moment he confronted the motorist, who got out of his vehicle and asked him for a fight in Dumbarton, near Glasgow.

In the footage the cyclist tells the driver, who is wearing a white cap and white t-shirt, 'here's your stupid litter back', before throwing the cup into the man's Vauxhall Corsa.

But after contacting the police the cyclist was warned he could be charged with common assault for instigating the fight.

Row: This is the moment a driver asked a cyclist for a fight after he confronted him about dropping litter

Drama: In the footage the cyclist tells the driver: 'Here's your stupid litter back', before throwing the cup into the man's Vauxhall Corsa

Officers added that no charges would be brought against the driver for threatening behaviour. 

The 20 year-old cyclist, who has asked not to be named, posted the video online last Thursday in an attempt to shame the motorist.

He said: 'I just thought for some reason in my head I should be confronting this person. I wasn't intending it in a very aggressive way.

'As I approached the driver I asked him to roll down the window and this was when I threw the cup in the window.'

The rider's video shows him picking up an empty Pepsi cup he claims the driver threw from his car.

He then pedalled after the black car, which was caught in traffic and tossed the cup back through his window.

Fury: The driver rushed out of his car to asked if he wants to go to a local park for a 'square go' - slang for a fight

The furious motorist leapt from his seat and challenged the cyclist to a fight before driving off.

He then turned around and wound down his window to hurl more abuse at the cyclist as he passed.

The cyclist caught the incident on a head cam and tried to report the motorist to police. 

In an expletive-laden rant, the driver says: 'What do you think you're doing, do you think you're smart or something? Get off the bike.'

He then walks back to his car, before driving past the cyclist, rolling down his window and asking if he wants to go to a local park for a 'square go'.

The cyclist declined and hurriedly pedalled away from the scene in Dumbarton, Scotland.

When the cyclist sent the video to police  he said two officers came to his house to see the footage. 

He claims they told he they could not bring a Breach of the Peace charge against the driver because the cyclist was clearly the instigator for throwing the cup inside the car.

They suggested that he should be charged with common assault but the case was dropped.

The cyclist said: 'I do feel this guy needs to be named and shamed.'
