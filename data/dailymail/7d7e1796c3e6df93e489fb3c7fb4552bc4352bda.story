An 18-stone mother-of-one was shamed into losing weight after snapping her daughter's bed while reading her a bedtime story.

Cacia Griggs, 26, from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, spent her whole 20s as a morbidly obese size 24, but crushing four-year-old Isabelle's bed was the final straw, and she embarked upon a life-changing diet.

Just one year later she has lost eight stone, dropped to a size 10, and married her fiance Chris in her dream wedding dress.

Cacia said: 'I'd had enough of being overweight. I have a four-year-old daughter called Isabelle and being overweight was having a huge impact on my life'

Cacia, who works in marketing, had always struggled with her weight, but when even her size 24 clothes were getting too tight and
she realised she desperately wanted to lose weight and wear fashionable clothes like
her friends, instead of being forced to shop in plus-sized stores and 
simply buying anything that fitted.

Cacia,
whose maiden name was Wilkinson, said: 'I'd tried every diet under the 
sun but never had the motivation to continue with it. But
I'd had enough of being overweight. I have a four-year-old daughter 
called Isabelle and being overweight was having a huge impact on my 
life.'

One night, having asked her 
29-year-old fiance to carry Isabelle up to 
bed because she couldn't fit through the stair gate, Cacia followed them
upstairs and lay down on the edge of the bed with her daughter to read 
her a story.

'I 
heard a loud snap,' she said. 'I'd literally broken the entire side beam of her bed 
because I was overweight.  I was devastated.'

Cacia had a similar moment of clarity while on her first family holiday with Chris and Isabelle in Turkey last year when she couldn't fit the aeroplane seatbelt around her.

She
said: 'I thought I was going to have to ask for a seat belt extension 
and the thought of this humiliation made me force the seat belt closed 
but it was so tight and uncomfortable, I was relieved when the seat belt
sign was switched off.

'I had the most wonderful daughter and fiancé and I should have been the happiest girl in the world, but in reality I was desperately unhappy'

'I knew after that I didn't want to go 
on holiday again at that weight and the ever-familiar guilt of knowing 
what that would take away from my family made me feel terrible.'

Cacia added: 'I
had the most wonderful daughter and fiancé and I should have been the 
happiest girl in the world, but in reality I was desperately unhappy 
with my weight controlling every thought that I had and everything that we did or didn't do.'

Cacia
was also desperate to set a date for her wedding but again kept putting
it off because of her weight, terrified she wouldn't find a dress that 
fitted her.

Cacia said: 'The thought of subjecting my beautiful 
little girl to a lifetime of weight-battling misery and ill-health was 
too much for me to bear. In that moment, I knew I had to make a change 
and it had to be now'

It was a newspaper article that finally shocked Cacia into losing the weight for good.

She said: 'The article explained how daughters of obese mothers were much more likely to grow up to be obese themselves.

'It might as well have been written about me and my daughter. She was already starting to copy my bad eating habits, asking for the fizzy drinks and junk food that I was eating.

'I realised the article was a stark warning about the issues that my daughter would be faced with because of me - diabetes, heart disease, and eventually premature death.

'The thought of subjecting my beautiful little girl to a lifetime of weight-battling misery and ill-health was too much for me to bear. In that moment, I knew I had to make a change and it had to be now.'

Cacia was able to wear her dream, size 10 wedding dress on her big day

Cacia began the Cambridge Weight Plan in June 2011, swapping her high-calorie diet for soups, shakes and bars.

'My
weight literally began to drop off,' she said. 'In no time at all I was
wearing smaller clothes and was over the moon the first time I brought a
size 16, I couldn't believe it fitted.

'For the first time I began to really believe that I could do this. People started noticing and I fell in love with exercise.'

In August this year, Cacia - who has now been crowned 
Cambridge Weight Plan's Slimmer of the Year - reached her goal weight of 10 stone and dropped from a size 24 to a size 10.

'I couldn't believe it,' said Cacia. 'My entire approach to food has changed, and my daughter's eating habits have radically changed too.

'She never asks for fizzy drinks now, it's nearly always water, and her new favourite thing in the world is broccoli!'

Cacia added: 'My life is so different and 
sometimes I feel like I'm someone else. I love shopping, wearing dresses
and skirts. Gone are the baggy tops and my black wardrobe.

'My
fiancé and I also finally set a date for our wedding and on 3 November 
we got married. I felt amazing and instead of wearing the size 16 dress 
I'd bought as my incentive to lose weight, I ended up wearing a size 10.
'I still have to pinch myself to think that I've come this far.'

Cacia says the best thing about losing the weight is being able to lay with her daughter again on her bed instead of sitting on the floor next to her.

She said: 'Recently I was reading The Very Hungry Caterpillar to Isabelle and she turned to me and said: "That was like you wasn't it mummy? You ate too much and got really fat, but now you've turned into a beautiful butterfly".

I burst into tears. Only a four-year-old can say something like that and really mean it. I have truly turned my life and my family's life around and now there's no going back.'

feel like I'm someone else. I love shopping, wearing dresses and 
skirts. Gone are the baggy tops and my black wardrobe'
