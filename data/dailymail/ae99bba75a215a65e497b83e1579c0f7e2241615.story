Lewis Hamilton was left with a protocol dilemma after cruising to the 31st victory of his career: how do you behave in front of the president of the Russian Federation?

He turned against the wall in the pre-podium room and fluffed his hair, as has become his custom in recent months. The question was immediately raised whether this was a calculated slight motivated by a political objection. Doubtful.

When Hamilton realised that Putin was in attendance, he shook the hand of the inscrutable leader, a ritual the pair repeated when Putin handed over the winner’s trophy for the inaugural Russian Grand Prix.

It was a processional bore of a race from the moment Nico Rosberg overcooked his move on Hamilton, the pole-sitter, on the first lap and went in for a change of tyres to cure the vibration caused by locking up.

But it was still an astonishing afternoon in this Black Sea resort.

An edict was sent out by Bernie Ecclestone calling for the Russian national anthem to be heard in stillness and silence. So he and the Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Kozak stood side by side with the drivers at the front of the grid as the 80-strong Kuban Cossack Chorus intoned the august hymn to the Motherland.

It was an amazing, and bizarrely moving, scene: this corporate sport of the West being trumpeted in the heartland of the old Eastern Bloc.

For Ecclestone it was a dream come true, 30 years after Leonid Brezhnev first mooted the idea of staging a race around the Kremlin.

But at this point there was no Putin, the anticipated grid walk off the schedule, possibly for security reasons. His arrival, was now scheduled for mid-race.

So with 39 laps gone, he was met at the circuit gates by Ecclestone, who usually flies home before the race ends. The two men, each in white shirt sleeves, are old friends. Putin invited Ecclestone to the Olympics staged in this very place earlier this year, but he could not go.

But there was no chance that Putin would stay away from this. His country spent £30billion-plus on creating an Olympic town out of nothing, and the grand prix is an associated project to show his people and the world what Russia can accomplish under his aegis.

Putin and Ecclestone along with the King of Bahrain, who was in town for talks with the president, went up to the VIP stand to watch the closing moments of the soporific action.

Putin barely speaks English but, as Ecclestone said afterwards, the two of them understand each other perfectly.

Four times the cameras cut away from the racing to show Putin in the stands. Accompanied by Ecclestone, he then went into the podium drivers’ room. He asked in Russian, which was translated into English: ‘How much weight do you lose in a race?’

‘He didn’t say anything to me,’ said the hirsute Hamilton of the pre-podium meeting. ‘He was talking to those girls behind. Then I realised he was there and came over and shook his hand.

‘It was surreal to meet him. I don’t know too much about him. I know a lot more about Barack (Obama). It was very cool to be presented the trophy by the president. He’s one of the most powerful men in the world.’

Hamilton was in control from the moment that Rosberg made a mistake on the very first lap

Was Putin presenting the prizes particularly unusual? No, heads of state often do so if they are attending a race. For example, the blazer-wearing Prince Albert performs the duty in Monaco every year.

What was different was the secrecy surrounding Putin’s movements to the extent that the PA announcer was handed a piece of paper that omitted to name Putin as the prize-giver.

For Hamilton, the race was won within moments of it beginning. Rosberg, who started second, pulled fractionally ahead of him on the first lap but ran wide, his tyres smoking as he did so.

He went in for a change of tyres, using his new pair for the 52 remaining laps of the 53-lap race. The asphalt was as smooth silk.

Such is the superiority of the Mercedes that Rosberg sliced through from the back to finish second. Valtteri Bottas, of a resurgent Williams, added to his burgeoning reputation by coming third. He is a good little racer.

Hamilton’s win takes his career tally level with Nigel Mansell. A 32nd win will make him outright the most prolific race winner. Victory extended his lead to 17 points – sadly a near-irrelevance because of the risible double points in the final race in Abu Dhabi. The American and Brazilian races come before the likely title decider in the gleaming extravagance in the desert on November 23.

But one championship was settled here: the constructors’ title going to Mercedes. With apologies to Stuttgart, this is a remarkable British feat given that Mercedes are based in Brackley, Northamptonshire.

If any one individual deserves praise it is Ross Brawn, the mastermind of their superiority. He was dispensed with in an awful power struggle last year and now spends more time with his family and his fishing rod.
