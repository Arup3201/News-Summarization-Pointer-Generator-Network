Tyson Fury has been warned he won't get away with fighting dirty on November 29 against new dad Dereck Chisora.

European heavyweight champion Chisora, in public for the first time with baby daughter Angelina, convincingly lost to Fury when the two met in July 2011.

Chisora's trainer Don Charles believes Fury got away with 'dirtiness' that night, and has pleaded with Marcus McDonnell, the third man in the ring later this month, to ensure there is no repeat.

Chisora, who lost his first fight against Fury back in 2011, lifts little Angelina above his head 

'When this fight was announced, all I said to Frank (Warren), "Get us a fair referee, a referee who's not gonna allow any nonsense that Tyson brings", said Charles.

'Because he brings a lot of dirtiness into his game. We will box fair, we will fight fair. A referee who's going to be fair is all we ask.

'The first fight Dereck had with Tyson Fury I was going to put in a complaint. He won, but he was allowed to get away with a lot of nonsense.

'In the rules meeting I will insist that the referee does his job professionally.'

Charles also revealed he had seen positive changes in Chisora since he became a father, and is also pleased he has a daughter instead of a son.

He said: 'I'm so glad he had a girl. The difference – everyone of us has got it inside us. Lets say he's a hard man. The girl will bring out the softness. 

'The daughter, daddy's girl, and trust me – every morning before every session, the first thing he does when he comes to the gym, he will do his hands, and then he will bring his phone, and say, "Have you seen what my daughter did last night?"

'That shows us this is a guy who is truly taken by that little girl.

'It's one of the hardest sports in the world. You're putting your life on the line every time you go in the ring. So you need something that's totally removed from what you do.

'When he looks at the girl every morning it gives him that extra motivation.'
