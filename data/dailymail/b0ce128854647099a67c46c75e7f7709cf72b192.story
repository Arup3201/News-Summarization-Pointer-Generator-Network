A Swedish couple were mistaken for Islamic State supporters when passers by mistook the birthday balloons in the window saying '21' as 'IS' - an abbreviation for the terrorist group.

They were in the window for Sarah Ericsson's birthday party held at her boyfriend's house last weekend according to Kvalls Posten, who reported the police came knocking on Monday.

Someone then saw the balloons from outside Fabian Akesson's home in Karlskrona and reported it as Islamic State propaganda.

Birthday surprise: Swedish couple Sarah Ericsson and Fabian Akesson were suspected of being Islamic State supporters when passers-by mistook the birthday balloons saying '21' in the window for 'IS'

He was brushing his teeth when he noticed several police cars parked outside the house before there was knock on the door minutes later.

Mr Akesson added: 'I laughed about it and even showed them a picture that we took. And from that perspective, it looked almost like the letters 'IS'.'

Despite the huge misunderstanding, the couple were still asked to take down the balloons to avoid further attention being drawn to their house.

Birthday girl Sara - who studies Spatial Planning at the Blekinge Institute of Technology - told the Local: 'It was a little strange.'

'We understand why someone would report it if they thought it looked like IS-propaganda, although everyone else just thought it looked like the number '12' from outside,' 

She was in class on Monday when the authorities paid a visit to her boyfriend's house, in what was a very unusual call-out for police in the area.

Officer Kurt Erik Gunnarsson said: 'I've never heard of such a thing before. It was new. The patrol got there and found out that someone had celebrated their 21st birthday.' 

'Extremism should always be taken seriously, and we did take the balloons down immediately,' Sarah Ericsson told the Local.

'I'm so surprised at all the attention. I will never forget my 21st birthday!'
