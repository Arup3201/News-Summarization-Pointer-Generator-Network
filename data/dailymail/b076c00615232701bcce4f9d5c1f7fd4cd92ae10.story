An X factor contestant got through the audition stages of X Factor, despite being on police bail over an alleged rape, it is claimed.

The 24-year-old singer songwriter reportedly auditioned for Simon Cowell and his fellow judges, Mel B, Cheryl Cole and Louis Walsh, before making it through to the next round.

However, the panel were unaware that the would-be star was the subject of a police investigation, having been arrested and questioned by detectives.

The contestant has now been dropped from the show for after he failed to declare the incident, and his appearance will not be broadcast on television

A 24-year-old singer songwriter reportedly auditioned for Louis Walsh, Mel B, Cheryl Cole and Simon Cowell while on police bail over an alleged rape

The rape is alleged to have taken place last year, and it is understood that the singer denies all of the accusations.

Police have not charged him in connection with the alleged sex attack, and according to The Sun, he will learn later this month if any further action is to be taken against him.

A friend said he had decided to try his hand at the TV talent search due to his admiration of Cole, who returned to the panel for its 11th series after leaving the show in 2010.

She took up a place on the U.S. version, but was fired by Cowell - after just one episode, reportedly over fears that American viewers would struggle to understand her Newcastle accent.

'He was naive to think this wouldn't become an issue,' the wannabe's friend told The Sun's Emma Brankin.

The singer is reportedly cooperating with police over the matter, after approaching them voluntarily.

X Factor bosses have now decided to drop the contestant from the show entirely - his audition will not appear on TV, and he will not be allowed to proceed to the later rounds of the competition.

Previous contestants have been dropped from the show if they have unspent criminal convictions or pending court cases, with each contestant assessed on an individual basis.

Return: Cheryl Cole and Simon Cowell have returned to the X Factor judging panel for the show's 11th series

Other contestants caught in 
controversy, but not involved in any criminal proceedings have been 
asked to leave the show, or have made the decision to quit.

In series four, contestant, 15-year-old
 Emily Nakanda, pulled out of the show two weeks into the live shows 
after she was allegedly filmed in a 'happy slapping' video.

In
 series seven, contestant Frankie Coccoza was asked to leave the 
competition, following claims he had boasted about drug use - which is 
strictly prohibited by the show's rules.Â 

In the show's most recent series 
singer Kazeem Ajobe from band Rough Copy was allowed to remain in the 
competition, despite not being granted a visa for the judges houses 
stage in New York because of past issues with the law.

He
 received a caution for assault on a man outside a train station back in
 2006, and was handed 250 hours of community service for affray a year 
later. In 2010, he was fined for possessing cannabis.

Auditions for series 11 started in March, with the show expected to air later this summer.

As
 well as Cole's return, Cowell is also making a comeback, having left at
 the end of series seven. As well as returning judge Louis Walsh, they 
will also be joined by a new face on the judging panel, former Spice 
Girl, Mel B.

ITV will be 
hoping the return of Cole and Cowell will boost ratings, after series 
ten attracted some of the lowest viewing figures in the show's history.

A
 peak audience of 11.5 million viewers watched Sam Bailey scoop last 
year's prize, compared with the 17.7 million who tuned in for Cole's 
last performance in December 2010.
