With the exception of Kim Kardashian, most women would be wary of letting their boyfriends or husbands serve as their personal stylists for the day - let alone a week - but that is exactly what one writer did.

After learning that her boyfriend Luke Winkie disliked her favorite pair of black shorts, Kelsey Lawrence, 25, from Austin, Texas, was inspired to give him complete control of her closet, allowing him to dress her without any limitations for an entire work week.

'I thought I had red-blooded, heterosexual dudes mostly figured out as far as what they think girls look most attractive in because I’ve spent a few years as an observant young female,' she wrote in an essay for xoJane. 'I was curious to put this to the test. What would he pick out for me?'

Monday: Kelsey, 25, was 'pleasantly surprised' by Luke's first outfit choice (pictured), which mixed color and prints

The rules were simple. Luke, who knew nothing about women's fashion, had to pick out Kelsey's outfits based solely on what he found her most attractive in. 

For his first day of styling his girlfriend, Luke chose an A-line, forest green skirt from Madewell, a loose, black H&M t-shirt and a leopard print cardigan from Goodwill. 

Black stockings and black ankle boots completed Kelsey's look. 

Kelsey noted that she was 'pleasantly surprised' that Luke was mixing colors and prints, and more importantly the outfit earned 'approving stares' at her suburban office. She even got a few compliments in the break room.

The next day Luke dressed her in a stomach-baring, polka dot L.A. Gear shirt, a pair of grey and white tie dye Levi's and a denim jacket. 

While the eclectic ensemble made Kelsey embarrassed to go to work, her worries were unfounded. 

Tuesday: Kelsey said she was embarrassed to go to work in this stomach-baring outfit that Luke put together, but she later received a genuine compliment on her new look from one of her female co-workers

Wednesday:  Luke's next look was somewhat of a dud because Kelsey was wary of wearing these old boot cut jeans from Aéropostale

Not only did a co-worker love her pants, she went on to tell Kelsey that she noticed 'something new was going on' with her. 

'I am simultaneously flattered and also now uncertain of anything I’ve worn ever,' Kelsey wrote. 'The outfits I’ve worn the past two days have garnered more compliments than any look I’ve put together for the last month.'

For the third day of her experiment, Luke opted for a casual look, putting Kelsey in 'very old' old pair of bootcut Aéropostale jeans, his baggy New Order t-shirt and a  herringbone hooded coat.

The entire look made her feel frumpy and 'mad unattractive', and she was shocked to learn that Luke wasn't a fan of the form-fitting leggings she usually wore.

The following day, Luke stuck with some of Kelsey's favorite wardrobe items and dressed her in a black Stone Cold Steve Austin Christmas sweatshirt and her high-waisted black jeans from H&M. 

Kelsey explained that the playful outfit made her realize she hasn't been dressing like herself lately, noting that she has been 'very safe' when choosing her looks.

Thursday: For day four, Luke picked out some of Kelsey's favorite wardrobe staples - a Stone cold Steve Austin Sweatshirt and high-waited jeans from H&M

Friday: On the last day of Kelsey's experiment, Luke dressed her in an eclectic outfit, which featured a football jersey, a fur coat and a shocking yellow miniskirt

For Luke's final day of styling, he paired a San Diego Chargers jersey with a tight yellow pencil mini skirt and a white rabbit fur coat that she recently purchased at a vintage boutique.

The somewhat over the top outfit was worn to pick up gummy bears at a grocery store before she headed to Luke's apartment to hang out.  

'My friend Andy told me I looked like an extra in a Cam’ron video,' she wrote. 'No higher compliment has been paid to me.'

With the exception of the ill-fitting Aéropostale jeans, none of Luke's chosen outfits were even close to being failures. In fact, many of them earned some unexpected compliments.

What's even more interesting is that Luke only spent a total of five minutes choosing Kelsey's outfits over the course of five days.  

The next time you're standing in front of your closet with 'nothing to wear', consider calling your boyfriend in for some help.  

Fresh faced: A year before Kelsey enlisted Luke to pick out her clothes, she dressed herself in a simple white t-shirt and form-fitting black pants 

Personal style: She wore a white short-sleeved button down with grey shorts in 2013
