Hotels.com has reported a huge rise in the number of travellers across the world who were researching trips to the floating city while the couple were pictured in the Italian hotspot over the weekend.

The firm also revealed that it's not just the British who are suddenly keen on Venice, with searches between 24th and 28th September up globally by 77 percent compared to the same dates last year.

Germany were ahead of the UK after an increase of 149 per cent in people searching Venice on the Hotels.com website, while the Netherlands were up by 125 per cent.

Lizann Peppard, of the Hotels.com, said: 'With international stardom comes international interest and the beautiful couple caused quite a stir over the weekend.

'With so many stunning images of the city beamed around the world, it's no surprise that many of us are now considering a getaway to this beautiful city.

'Happily, there is no need to break into the bank to follow in the footsteps of the Ocean's Eleven star as there are plenty of more affordable bargains there to be found.'

Tourist however might struggle to re-create the same level of glamour as Mr Clooney, who hired out rooms for his guests at the five-star Belmond Cipriani Hotel on the city's Giudecca Island.

Venice is one of the world's most romantic cities, sited on a group of 118 small islands separated by canals and linked by bridges

The venue, which opened in 1958, is one of the most expensive hotels in the world with rates starting at around £800 per night.

During the four days of festivities, the newlyweds also held their wedding ceremony at the exclusive seven-star Aman Resort overlooking the historic Grand Canal.

Smiling, kissing and waving to well-wishers, they were treated to the kind of excited welcome normally reserved for royalty.

The Ocean's Eleven star also dined at the city's Da Ivo restaurant on the night before he tied the knot.

The spectacle finished on Monday when the couple completed formalities with a civil ceremony held at Venice's city hall, a 13th century building overlooking the Grand Canal.
