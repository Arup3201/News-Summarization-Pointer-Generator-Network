A Swedish public service reporter has come under fire for asking Crown Princess Victoria about her ‘Nazi’ grandfather while at the Auschwitz memorial service.

The Crown Princess of Sweden attended yesterday’s event on the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the former Nazi concentration camp, alongside hundreds of survivors and  dignitaries.

Flanked by two Auschwitz survivors, Crown Princess Victoria was asked if she had ‘considered the family history’ during the ceremony.

Outrage: A reporter asked Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden about her maternal grandfather, who was a Nazi sympathiser in the 1930s, at the Auschwitz memorial service

Ancestor: Her grandfather Walther Sommerlath had joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), more commonly known as the Nazi Party, as an expatriate in Brazil in 1934

Rolf Fredriksson, a reporter for Swedish public service channel Sveriges Television, interviewed the Crown Princess and Auschwitz survivors Hédi Fried och Emerich Roth at the ceremony.

‘Has the Crown Princess considered the family history?,' he asked.

'There are relatives further back who were Nazi supporters,’ Mr Fredriksson added before highlighting the achievement of the Crown Princess’s great uncle, diplomat Folke Bernadotte, who saved thousands from the Nazi camps.

The Crown Princess did not address the line of question and instead stared Mr Fredriksson down as she spoke.

Strange ask: Crown Princess Victoria, pictured yesterday, found question 'out of context'

‘Nazism is something horrifying and it is one of humanities worst histories,’ the 36-year-old first-in-line said.

 ‘It is a long history. We have a lot of information and one can take part of that if one so wishes.’

Representatives of the Royal Court of Sweden were critical of the question, and said that it had been unjustified.

'You wonder what the point was. In this instance, the Crown Princess was standing with two elderly people, survivors of the Holocaust,' said Royal head of press Margareta Thorgren.

Queen Silvia of Sweden, Crown Princess Victoria’s mother, was born in Germany in 1943, the daughter of businessman Walther Sommerlath and his Brazilian wife Alice de Toledo Sommerlath.

Walther Sommerlath had joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), more commonly known as the Nazi Party, as an expatriate in Brazil in 1934.

Mr Sommerlath has been accused of taking part in the 'aryanisation' of Jewish-owned businesses in Germany, after buying a metal engineering plant in Berlin from a Jewish engineer for a knock-down price in 1939.

Queen Silvia has publicly apologised on behalf of her father, saying she only found out about his former NSDAP membership as an adult.

On the opposite side of the family tree is diplomat Folke Bernadotte, King Carl XVI Gustav’s godfather and his father’s cousin.

During the Second World War, Count Bernadotte negotiated the release of about 31,000 prisoners from German concentration camps, including 450 Danish Jews from Theresienstadt.

After the war he worked as a UN mediator between Israel and Palestine, before he was assassinated in Jerusalem in 1948.

Crown Princess Victoria’s daughter Estelle, third in line to the throne, is named after his wife.

The broadcast of the interview with the Crown Princess caused outrage on social media in Sweden.

A number of people accused Sveriges Television of trying to blame the Crown Princess for her grandfather’s actions, with one tweeter calling reporter Mr Fredriksson a 'coconut,' Aftonbladet reports.

Moderate Party MP Maria Abrahamsson tweeted: ‘So incredible tasteless of @rolffred in Auschwitz today to try to play the Crown Princess’s grandfather and Folke Bernadotte against each other’.

‘Tasteless of the journalist to pressure Crown Princess Victoria about her family’s past in Auschwitz,’ Swedish Bar Association's general secretary Anne Ramberg tweeted.

Ms Thorgren added that Crown Princess's reaction had been 'about the same as on social media'.

'It felt like the question did not belong in the context. It meant more to her to be there and honour the victims of the Holocaust'.

Rolf Fredriksson himself defended his question, tweeting: 'No blame on next generations, but they are responsible for debate.’
