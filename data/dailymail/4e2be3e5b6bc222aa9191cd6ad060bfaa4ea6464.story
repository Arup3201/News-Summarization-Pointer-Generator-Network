A woman has died after she got hit by a wave and swept out to sea while paddling on Christmas Day, police have said.

The woman, who is believed to have suffered head injuries after colliding with a groyne, was recovered from the sea and taken to hospital, where she has today died.

She was pulled out of the water after two lifeboats were sent to rescue her, following the attempts of three other people who also jumped into the sea to try and drag her back to shore.

A police spokesman today said: 'At 10.40am yesterday an adult female was paddling in the sea at Hastings when it appears that she was hit by a wave and taken a short distance out to sea.

'The lady was recovered from the sea and given emergency CPR before being taken to a local hospital.

'Sadly she has died as a result of this incident.'

A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman told Mail Online three people had gone into the sea to rescue her before the lifeboats arrived, but had managed to get back out safely.

A Dover Coastguard spokesman told the BBC: 'She collided with a groyne, suffered head injuries and was face-down in the water for some time.'

The spokesman said the winds were gusting at around 50 knots.

Yesterday, the traditional festive swim in Brighton, just over 30 miles away from Hastings and also on the south coast, was called off after the local council closed the beach due to bad weather.

Brighton and Hove City Council said conditions would be 'extremely dangerous' for even experienced swimmers, with winds of up to 30mph, a high tide and a heavy sea swell forecast.

The council also said the water would be very cold at this time of year, with a temperature of around five degrees.
