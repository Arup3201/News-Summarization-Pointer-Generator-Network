It's hard to believe that a little girl in pigtails, who's only in her first year of school, could possibly be the best six-year-old surfer and skater in the world.

She goes by the name of 'the flying squirrel' and she's only been surfing for 18 months.

So there's no disputing that Quincy Symonds has certainly defied the odds from her birth up until now, proving that age is no barrier when it comes to excelling at your ultimate passions in life.

Six-year-old Quincy Symonds from Tweed Heads, north-eastern NSW, has been surfing for 18 months

Nicknamed 'the flying squirrel', she hopes to make a mark on the surfing and skating world

The fearless girl has already gained multiple surfing sponsors and has been dubbed as the next Layne Beachley or Stephanie Gilmore

The Tweed Heads local caught her first wave at the age of four when she decided she would go out with her father Jake while they were holidaying in the Gold Coast, 94km south of Brisbane.

'She had no idea what surfing was but she just wanted to hang out with her daddy,' mother Kim Symonds said.

When Quincy was born, she was kept in the Intensive Care Unit for three weeks

'She hadn't swum in the ocean much or wasn't exposed to the water that much as she lived near a farm but she really doesn't like missing out on things.

'After her first wave, she was addicted.'

Mrs Symonds witnessed the change in her daughter that very moment she jumped on her surfboard.

'I was freaking out but she looked so excited but once she got on that board there was something about her that changed,' she said.

'Her mindset is different and she's not afraid of the ocean. She seems so calm and complete when she's out there.

'I know the risks involved but it's where she wants to be so I wouldn’t stop her from that.'

Two months later, Quincy's parents decided that when the ocean was too rough for their little one she would have to find another alternative. That's when her other love for skating began.

'She keeps saying that she wants to be a pro surfer and skater when she grows up and she loves the two sports equally so she wouldn't be able to choose between the two,' Mrs Symonds said.

'I think it's awesome. It's such an adventure we're on and it feels as though she's the one who's taking us for a ride.'

But the journey hasn't been without its complications.

Quincy has big dreams with hopes of becoming both a pro surfer and skater when she grows up

At birth, Quincy suffered from adrenal insufficiency which left her in the Intensive Care Unit for three weeks.

She was diagnosed with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia which means she is steroid dependent.

Since then, the fearless little girl has been taking cortisone medication three times a day.

'If someone told me five years ago that I'd be where I'm at now I would've laughed,’ Mrs Symonds said.

'Quincy blows my mind. I'm speechless. I don't know how she does it at her age and how she can be so focused and driven.

'But I think when you find your passion nothing can hold you back. Not even Quincy's condition or her age and you could see that when she was out in the water.'

So much so, the six-year-old has already signed on multiple surfing sponsors and gained a huge following on social media.

Her coach Anthony Pope says she has a lot of potential and could possibly be the world's best surfer and skater in her age group.

'She has incredible balance and her ability to judge the conditions and adjust is at a level I've never seen in someone her age,' he told the ABC.

Quincy's love for surfing began when she decided that she wanted to follow her father out for a surf during a holiday in the Gold Coast, southeastern Queensland

But the little surfer and skater says she loves both sports and couldn't possibly choose between the two

Quincy started skating when her parents decided there were times when it was too dangerous to be out in the water

Despite her big dreams, the flying squirrel - a nickname which stuck as a toddler when she befriended the furry animal while her family lived in the US - has only just started in her first year at school.

However there are times when she wishes she was elsewhere.

'When there’s a big swell or the weather is nice, she says she wants to go out in the water or skating,' Mrs Symonds said.

'People say it's funny hearing that from a little girl.

'So I asked her why she loves it so much and she simply said: "it's just what I do".'
