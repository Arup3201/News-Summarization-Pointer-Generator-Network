You better watch out, and you better not cry, because Santa Claus is coming to town  - and he is being accompanied by a gruesome creature called the Krampus.

This devil-like character is the evil companion of St. Nicholas, the kindly winter gift-bringer who rewards good children each year.

But according to Austrian folklore, while the generous Saint hands out gifts to the good, he leaves the task of punishing bad children to his hell-bound cloven-hoofed counterpart, who beats the children then drags them to his fiery underworld.

But while he rewards the good children for their behaviour - he leaves his fearsome companion to deal with the bad

Krampus, in Tyrol also called Tuifl, is a demon-like creature represented by a fearsome, hand-carved wooden mask with animal horns, a suit made from sheep or goat skin and large cow bells attached to the waist

Sixteen Krampus groups including over 200 Krampuses participated in the first annual celebratory event in Neustift, Tyrol, western Austria.

The demon-like creature is portrayed with  a fearsome, hand-carved wooden mask complete with animal horns. He wears a suit made from sheep or goat skin with large cow bells attached to the waist.

Krampus has been a part of Central European, alpine folklore going back at least a millennium. He accompanies St. Nicholas and the angels on the evening of December 5 to visit households to reward children that have been good while punishing the bad

Hand-crafted Krampus masks lie in the snow. Krampus is celebrated on Krampusnacht, on the eve of St. Nicholas' Day. In Austria, Northern Italy and other parts of Europe, party-goers masquerade as devils and witches to participate

Krampus has been a part of Central European, alpine folklore going back at least a millennium.

Since the 17th-century Krampus traditionally accompanies St. Nicholas and angels on the evening of December 5 to visit households to reward children that have been good while reprimanding those who have not.

However, in the last few decades Tyrol in particular has seen the founding of numerous village Krampus associations with up to 100 members each and who parade without St. Nicholas at Krampus events throughout November and early December. 

The cloven hoofed creature is depicted as a devil with horns, hooves and snarling mouth. He punishes the naughty children, by beating them with rusty chains before dragging them in baskets to a fiery underworld

Krampus night is an important tradition in the European calendar and young and old join in the celebrations

The feared Krampus is said to capture particularly naughty children in his sack and drag them away to his lair

Members of the Haiminger Krampusgruppe prepare to parade on the town square. Europeans have excahnged greeting cards featuring Krampus since the 1800s - a traiditon which has recently become popular once again
