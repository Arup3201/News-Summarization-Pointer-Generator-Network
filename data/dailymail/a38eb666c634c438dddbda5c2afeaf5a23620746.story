When Sir Bobby Charlton presents Wayne Rooney with his 'Golden Cap' ahead of his 100th England game on Saturday, all eyes will be on Roy Hodgson's captain.

After 99 appearances and 43 goals, the striker will follow the likes of Steven Gerrard and Ashley Cole in receiving the honour.

And as England's golden boy prepares for the occasion, Sportsmail takes a look who is behind the centenary cap, and the making of it ahead of game at Wembley.

Toye & Co are responsible for creating medals and ribbons for the FA Cup and have again been trusted by the association for Rooney's garment.

The only part that is not done by hand by the company, is the process of embroidering the England crest onto the front of the cap.

Enscribed on the cap, it reads: 'UEFA Euro 2016 Qualifying Round England v Slovenia, 2014'

In operation for more than three centuries, Toye & Co is the oldest fraternal regalia maker in the world.

It makes the CBEs and MBEs which honour those who have done great things in public life, as well as the military medals which adorn soldiers who have shown valour on the battlefield, and much more.

But this weekend, the spotlight will be on Rooney when he reaches the century milestone at Wembley.

'It's an honour for them to get the cap and it's an honour for us as a company to make them,' one worker admits in the video.
