Prosecutors filed charges of bomb possession against a recently crowned Utah beauty pageant winner.

Kendra McKenzie Gill was arrested last weekend with three accomplices for what one described as a prank.

The 18-year-olds were arrested Saturday after driving around neighborhoods and allegedly tossing plastic bottles filled with caustic chemicals at people they knew.Â

Kendra McKenzie Gill, 18-year-old Utah beauty contest winner, was arrested on felony charges for throwing bombs

All four face the same set of four felony charges, prosecutor Blake Nakamura said.

'We don't really understand a clear reason for their behavior,' he said. 'The reason we charged them is obviously, what they possessed was indeed explosives, and we're alleging they were throwing them near homes and at people, and therefore, had the potential to cause a great deal of harm.'

No one was injured in the incident.

Felony bomb possession is punishable by 1 to 15 years in prison.

Gill is charged with manufacturing home-made bombs which her and three other teenagers threw from a moving car and people and homes

Gill was crowned Miss Riverton, topping a slate of nine beauty contestants earlier this summer in the Salt Lake City suburb. She showed off years of piano training with a Scott Joplin number and took home a $2,000 scholarship.

Others charged Friday were John Patrick Reagh, Shanna Marie Smith and Bryce Christopher Stone.

All four are due to make their first court appearance together August 26 in Salt Lake City. Each has been released on $50,000 bond.

The teens are charge with ten first degree felony counts including construction on an incendiary device, KUTV.com reported.

Gill had just been crowned Miss Riverton and was supposed to go on to compete for the Miss Utah title before her arrest

All four teens acknowledged they were tossing bombs powered by a toilet bowl cleaner reacting with aluminum foil on sidewalks, front yards or in streets 'to scare some of their other friends,' Unified Fire Authority investigator Steve Bowen said in a court affidavit.

Stone reportedly told authorities it was a prank.

'They were throwing them at both property and people,' Unified Fire Authority Capt. Clint Mecham told KUTV-TV earlier this week. 'This goes well beyond a teenage prank.'

One of Gill's friends claims they were throwing the bombs as a prank, however, authorities said someone could have been gravely injured by the explosives

'They're very caustic, very nasty. So they can cause injury to somebody 
just if the chemicals get on somebody, much less the fragmentation of 
the shrapnel damage that can be caused,' Mecham told the television station. 'They can very 
easily cause serious harm or even death.'

A Riverton pageant official didn't immediately return calls Friday on Gill's prospects for moving up in beauty competitions, or whether her title will be revoked.

'That's a local matter,' said Jean Hatch, a producer for the Miss Utah Scholarship Pageant, set for next June.

Hatch said she didn't know if Gill's legal troubles would disqualify her from statewide competition.
