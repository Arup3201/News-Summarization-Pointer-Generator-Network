Cesc Fabregas is set to return from a thigh injury in time to feature in Chelsea’s Barclays Premier League clash with West Bromwich Albion on Saturday.

It was initially feared the Spanish midfielder would miss three weeks of action with a minor thigh tear that ruled him out of his country’s games against Belarus and Germany during the international break.

But Fabregas trained on Thursday at Chelsea’s Cobham training base and looks likely to feature for the league leaders at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, returning to the side a week ahead of schedule.

The former Arsenal skipper has started every league game this season alongside Nemanja Matic in the centre of midfield – and that trend now looks set to continue.

The news could further fuel suspicions in Spain over the commitment of Fabregas and team-mate Diego Costa, after both played through the pain barrier in Chelsea’s 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield but pulled out of Vicente del Bosque’s squad.

Costa had been struggling with injuries to his hamstring and his groin, while manager Jose Mourinho spoke regularly about the need for his top scorer to be rested – a request eventually granted by Del Bosque.

Spain team-mate Sergio Ramos appeared to question the commitment of the Chelsea duo last week – although he later claimed that his comments relating to wanting ‘players to show the same commitment to the national team as they do to their club’ were not about the pair.

A win against the Baggies on Saturday would extend Chelsea’s at the top of the Premier League to seven points, with second-placed Southampton not playing until Monday night.
