A terrified youngster screamed in horror when she opened a
bag of hay bought for her pet guinea pigs and found a rotten deer leg with bits of fur and decomposing flesh inside.

Isabel Henderson, was stunned to find the animal’s decaying limb in the sack of hay meant for her two pet guinea pigs Ginny and Squeak.

The Bob Martin My Little Friend Meadow Hay had been bought
from a branch of Sainsbury’s in Woodford, Greater London, on Wednesday morning and Isabel's furious father James now wants compensation from the supermarket giant.

Shocking: Isabel Henderson, 11, opened up this bag of hay which had been bought from Sainsbury's for her pet guinea pigs to discover a deer leg.

He said his daughter was stunned when she discovered the 1ft long
decomposing deer leg sticking out of the 3kg bag.

He said she let out a
piercing scream and went charging through the house shouting: 'Dad there’s
something dead in the bag.'

The father-of-one, who lives with partner, Lucie Ebinik, 50,
said he was in the kitchen making breakfast when he heard the scream: 'It’s an
awful thing for an 11-year-old-girl to see but she has coped with it rather
bravely,' he said.

'My wife didn’t want to look so I had to deal with
it.

'There was this black cloven hoof sticking out of the hay,
it was all a bit grim,' he added.

'I pulled it out and it was clearly a deer leg with bits of
fur and decomposing flesh attached to it.

Surprise: The deer leg with fur and decomposing flesh on it was found in Bob Martin's 'My Little Friend Meadow Hay'. The packaging boasts it is 'hygenic and easy to use'

Disturbing: Hamster lover Isabel screamed when she made the gruesome discovery in a bag of Bob Martin's 'My Little Friend Meadow Hay' intended for guinea pigs Ginny and Squeak

'It was curled up but extended I should think the thing was
about 1ft long.

'The worrying thing is where is the rest of the body is -
there could be some poor family out there with a whole head in there hay.'

Astonishingly the manufacturers of the hay, Bob Martin,
advertise the product as ‘fresh and hygienic’ and say it makes a ‘soft cosy
home’ for pets.

Mr Henderson, a communications consultant, bought the £1.99 bag
from Sainsbury’s in South Woodford, East London, and called the store to let
them know about the grim find.

He then contacted customer services - who apologised
straight away before returning the leg to a shocked shopping assistant the same
day.

He was told the store would look into the case, but thinks he should
receive compensation.

He added: 'It is not just a little mistake it is pretty bad
for a supermarket to sell a product with a deer leg in it.

'I think they need to look into this product to make sure it
doesn’t happen again, because this was a pretty traumatic experience for a
young child.’

Isabel, who was getting ready for school at the time of the
bizarre discovery said: 'It was very scary and when I told my friends at
school, they couldn’t believe it.

Gruesome: Isabel, who was getting ready for school at the time of the bizarre discovery, said it was very scary and when she told her friends at school

'I will carry on feeding Ginny and Squeak and putting down
their hay, but I think I will get my dad to open the bags from now on.'

A spokesman for Sainsbury's said: 
'Naturally we are very alarmed and would like to sincerely apologise to 
the Henderson family.  We are urgently investigating this with our 
supplier.'

A spokesman for Bob Martin said: 'We would like to express
our sincere apologies to James and Isabel Henderson for any distress caused
following the discovery of animal matter in a pack of Bob Martin Meadow Hay.

'Before being packed into little bales, the untreated
natural hay is visually inspected and mechanically screened to get the
undersize material out.

'However, due to the nature of the harvesting and automated
packing processes, preventing foreign objects from ending up in the hay,
including plant life and, on extremely rare occasion’s animal matter, cannot be
guaranteed.

'Our Quality Team will be reviewing processes to see how we
can best prevent a reoccurrence.'
