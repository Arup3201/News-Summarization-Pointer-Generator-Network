Scam: Nguyen used $16,000 and also took her family on a Disneyland trip, the Arapahoe County Sheriff's said

The Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office said in a March release 'it was discovered that [Nguyen] did convince her son, family and community that her 6-year-old had cancer and was receiving cancer treatment since approximately September 2012.'

One year later, 'over $25,000' was gathered by Aurora residents, the sheriff's office said.

However, the sheriff's office revealed that 'Over the last several months, Ms. Nguyen accepted at least $16,000.00 from that account as well as a trip to Disneyland for herself and her family, which was paid for by the donated funds.'

$23,000 was found inside her home 'and in a subsequent interview, [Nguyen] admitted that her son does not have cancer, and stated that some of the money recovered was from donations received,' the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office said.

Bogus: The story of Nguyen's 'cancer-stricken' son was also heavily featured in a charity race

Hoax: Nguyen allegedly falsely posted online a list of cancer treatments for her son 

Nguyen's son, in excerpts of an arrest affidavit published by CBS Denver, said 'he believes he has cancer and is going to die' and was under the impression he received nightly chemotherapy treatments. 

The boy also revealed 'his mom shaves his head every morning before school,' according to the published excerpts.

7NewsDenver reported  Nguyen's 'cancer-stricken' son was also heavily featured in a charity race, and that she posted 'updates' on his treatment online.

The principal of the boy's school, Darla Thompson, said in a letter published by the station 'We are deeply troubled by these allegations and saddened to learn that an adult may have taken advantage of an innocent child and our school community.'

'But the allegations do not, in any way, diminish the concern and support demonstrated by the Rolling Hills community for a child believed to be facing a life-threatening challenge.

'It is important for our community to continue to show support and compassion for this child, who is also a victim in this case. The child was wrongfully led to believe that he was ill, and he was not responsible for the parent’s alleged actions.'
