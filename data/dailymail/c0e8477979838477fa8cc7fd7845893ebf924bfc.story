A teacher at a Los Angeles-area high school is on paid leave as administrators investigate her profanity-laden outburst in class this week.

That outburst happened Wednesday at the new Humanities and Art (HArts) Academy, located on the Narbonne High School campus in Harbor City.

The teacher was being heckled by a student in the middle of the lesson when she broke down.

Teacher tirade: A teacher at the Humanities and Art Academy is on paid leave as administrators investigate a viral audio recording of her cussing at students in her class

Careful what you say: The outburst happened at the Humanities and Art Academy, a new school located on the campus of Narbonne High School in Harbor City, California

'I know my f****** shit. Don't f*** with that. I'm tired of trying to educate you and you guys resist every step of the f****** way. Get the f*** out of here.'

The student heckler recorded the outburst, and it has since went viral online.

The unidentified teacher in question was placed on paid leave, and has since issued an apology in the Daily Breeze.

'You know, I had a weak moment,' she said. 'Forgive me.' 

The teacher explained that she was in the middle of a lecture about how the term 'African-American' can be a misnomer when a student started heckling her.

She says that though her family traces its roots back to Italy, she doesn't call herself an 'Italian-American'.

'You're an American first,' she said.

But the student who started heckling her insisted that she was wrong.

When the teacher broke down, that student recorded the outburst and shared it with another teacher who encouraged her to keep spreading it.

'This girl took my moment of weakness and used it against me,' she said. 'And then the teacher (at Narbonne) egged (the student) on to send it to her, and then they disseminated it. It's just cruel.

The teacher also explained that she was stressed out because of health issues and recently underwent an appendectomy.

Warning: A school district representative said that usually teachers are issued with a 'notice of unsatisfactory act' for such behavior

'I’ve always felt safe with my students,' she said. 'That’s why it hurts so much that someone would do this.'

Ellen Morgan, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified School District said they are continuing to investigate the incident.

'At the outcome of the investigation, he/she will meet with the individual and conference, reprimand and/or move to recommend dismissal,' Ms Morgan said in an email to the Daily Breeze.

Morgan said that usually in these cases, a teacher would receive a 'notice of unsatisfactory act' for the behavior.

The outburst has caused a mixed reaction among the high school's students and their parents.

'I think the teacher should get fired for talking to the student that way,' Narbonne junior Carla Mateo told NBC Los Angles. 'They're not supposed to react like that no matter what the situation was.'

Aaron Taylor, another student, said it was wrong that the teacher cussed but noted that other students egg on the teachers.

Sympathetic: Student Aaron Taylor said that while the cussing was wrong, he understands why she did it because students can often egg teachers on

'She's a good teacher. Everybody makes mistakes and she's only human,' he told KTLA.

Parent Anton Georgis agrees.

'Why would a student heckle a teacher? They're there for an education if they can't understand that, the teacher should have went to the principal and the student should be taken to a lower grade to be re-educated,' Georgia said.
