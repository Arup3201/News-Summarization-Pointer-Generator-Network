Discarded wet wipes are blighting Britain’s shores – with a 50 per cent rise last year in the number found.

An average of 56 wipes per mile were retrieved in the Marine Conservation Society’s annual clean-up of some 300 beaches.

It also found a sharp rise in litter overall in parts of the UK.

Rubbish on some beaches in the South West increased by 89 per cent in 2014 compared with the year before, the MCS found.

Popular holiday destinations in Cornwall were among the worst, including Porthpean, Porthtowan, Gwithian and Gunwalloe Fishing Cove.

The MCS complained that wet wipes – which are being used to remove make-up, replace toilet paper and apply fake tan – do not disintegrate like toilet paper, which means they survive being flushed or thrown away.

Earlier this year, Southern Water revealed more than 2,000 tons of wet wipes were playing havoc with sewers in Kent.

Research for United Utilities in the North West showed one in ten households have had blocked toilets and drains due to baby wipes and make-up wipes.

Charlotte Coombes of the MCS said the wipes should be thrown in the bin, not down the toilet, adding: ‘Our sewerage systems weren’t built to cope with wet wipes … they typically contain plastic so once they reach the sea they last for a very long time.

‘They can cause blockages in our sewers, then everything else that has been flushed down the loo can either back up into people’s homes, or overflow into rivers and seas.

‘Overflows also happen during excessive rainfall, or if the plumbing hasn’t been connected up properly, meaning the wrong pipes are heading straight to the sea. That’s when we find sewage-related debris, including wet wipes, on the beach.’

Plastic bottles and aluminium cans made up 10 per cent of the litter found in the MCS clean-up in September.

The charity called for the introduction of a refund of 10p-30p for containers that are returned for recycling.

Volunteers also came across bizarre items including a plastic hand, a colostomy bag, a piping nozzle, and on one beach, nine pairs of shoes.

The MCS found an average of 3,955 bits of litter per mile in 2014, up 6.4 per cent on the year before. Welsh beaches were the dirtiest with an average of 10,360 rubbish items per mile.
