Queensland scientists have made a breakthrough in their fight against chlamydia and the damage the infection is inflicting on the koala population. 

Scientists at the University of the Sunshine Coast have spent five years working on the vaccine for the sexually transmitted infection which has left koalas on the verge of extinction.

The infection, which is rapidly being transmitted during birth and physical contact, is one of the main reasons the iconic Australian marsupials are now listed as endangered species.

But researchers have successfully trialled the vaccine after observing wild koalas in the Moreton Bay region, north of Brisbane.

Chlamydia, also known as 'wet bottom' or 'dirty tail', causes blindness and infertility in koalas. 

Sixty koalas were captured, tagged and monitored, while 30 animals receiving the vaccine and 30 remaining unvaccinated as a control group.

USC microbiologist Professor Peter Timms told Daily Mail Australia that they had successfully immunised the koalas and the results were promising.

'What we wanted to do was capture koalas from the wild and find out two things,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'The first thing was to cure the ones already infected and see if the vaccine has decreased the disease.

'And secondly, we wanted to help prevent healthy koalas from getting infected in the future.’

Mr Timms said the vaccine decreased chlamydia infection levels in the koalas who received the dose.

'This large trial has confirmed that the vaccine is safe to give to not only captive koalas, but also koalas in the wild,' he said.

'We found a positive response and we know the vaccination is getting better and we're going the right direction as well.'

The million dollar project allowed the research team to put a 'radio collar' on each vaccinated koala to be able to keep track before releasing them back into the sanctuary.

'The radio collars are worth $1000 each and they help us monitor and give samples of their health,' he said.

'They are really expensive and the project was heavily funded to make it all possible.

The trial will extend for at least another year but Mr Timms said the team wants to follow the animals for two more years. 

'We hope to specifically show a positive effect of the vaccine on disease, not just infection, as well as female reproductive rates,' he said.

'It's a long process but it's rewarding and we want to make a difference.'
