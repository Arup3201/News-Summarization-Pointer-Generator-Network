Gunner wear it? This could be the Arsenal kit for next season - their first Puma strip

Gunners midfielder 
Mesut Ozil was spotted outside his London home brandishing a replica 
shirt complete with No 11 - the squad number designated to the Germany 
international.

Speculation
 is rife that Ozil has got his hands on the Gunners' home shirt for next
 season, despite the new design not having been revealed by the club.

Twitter
 user @ArsenalEdits tweeted Sportsmail with two images of an Ozil shirt 
(below), which they claim is Puma's first home shirt of a new five-year,
 £150million deal.

Ozil was carrying the Arsenal merchandise as well as an iPad as he stepped out of his imported £200,000 Mercedes SLS.
