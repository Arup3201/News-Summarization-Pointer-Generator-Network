Over 1,000 rare relics from the Third Reich are going under the hammer in one of the biggest ever auctions of Nazi war items.

Macabre items including a love letter written to Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's secret accounts book and even the Nazi leader's personal desk are all part of the huge sale in Stamford, Connecticut.

Top of the lots was the ceremonial brass desk belonging to Hitler which the Nazi leader used at the signing of the Munich Pact, which preceded the Second World War.

Relic: Adolf Hitler's desk, on which he signed the Munich Pact, sold for $423,000

The brass ceremonial desk includes ink wells and the Nazi crest with an eagle and swastika

The brass desk set, with an inscribed 'AH', was said to have been designed by Hitler himself, according to auctioneers

The desk, which is inscribed with 'AH' and includes ink wells and the Nazi crest of an eagle and swastika, fetched $423,000 today, according to the auction house.

Auctioneers say the two-day sale of Third Reich items reflects a boom in the Nazi relic trade, which has been expanding the more the Second World War fades into history.

Other items in the extensive collection range from a photo from a Hitler Youth rally signed by Nazi leader Arthur Axmann, which is set to fetch $200, to Joseph Goebbel's handwritten love letters, which could fetch $9,000.

Insight: An incredible collection of love letters written by Jewish schoolteacher Esle Janke to Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels is also included in the lot

Signed: Letters written by Hitler one while he was incarcerated at Landsberg Prison for his participation in the abortive 'Beer Hall Putsch', the second written three weeks after his release, are also part of the huge collection

Revealing: Another page of love letters exchanged between Goebbels and the Jewish teacher reveal how the Nazi leader lost interest in her when he discovered her roots. On the right, another Hitler letter is displayed

The September 30, 1938 agreement which appeased Germany's ambitions to extend its borders allowed it to take over Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, a region where ethnic Germans lived.

The vain hope was that it would curb the nation's thirst for expansion.

The signing of the Pact saw British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain fly to Germany where he attempted to negotiate alongside French premier Édouard Daladier and Hitler's ally the Italian leader Benito Mussolini.

The appeasement deal saw Chamberlain announce ‘peace in our time’ on his return yet war broke out a year later as Hitler continued his plans for German dominance of Europe.

Bill Panagopulos, President of the Stamford Alexander Auction House, said: 'People want souvenirs – I would even sell Hitler's moustache.

'For all intents and purposes the piece is sold for $423,000.'

Andreas Kornfeld, also with the auctioneers, said the buyer of the desk was a private U.S. west coast collector.

Buyers at the Nazi auction range from
nouveau riche Russians and private historians to wealthy Jewish bidders
who purchase historically important memorabilia for museums.

'We don't get neo-Nazis – they have neither the brains nor the money,'

The
Munich Pact ceded the Sudetenland, a heavily ethnic-German part of 
Czechoslovakia, to Germany and was meant to appease Hitler's 
expansionist ambitions.

However, the pact served to encourage Hitler, leading to Germany's invasion of Poland and the triggering of World War II.

Memorabilia: A school journal belonging to Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels contains notes written as a schoolboy about his classes and teachers

Boom: Auctioneers say they have seen a rise in people demanding Nazi relics, such as this signed photo of Adolf Hitler outside Landsberg Prison

Portrait: A 9 x 11' profile shot of Hitler is 
another item on sale in the macabre display, along with the class 
journal belonging to Joseph Goebbels from when he was a schoolboy, right
