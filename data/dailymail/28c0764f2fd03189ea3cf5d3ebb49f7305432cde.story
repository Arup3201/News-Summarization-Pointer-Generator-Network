Harlequins will play Chris Robshaw and the rest of their weary England contingent in Sunday’s showdown with Leinster - on the basis that they will soon have precious time off.

Test captain Robshaw and his clubmate Mike Brown played every minute of England’s four-match autumn campaign, and Quins captain Joe Marler started every game.

Quins director of rugby Conor O’Shea insists they are ready to commit body and soul to the key European Champions Cup tie.

‘There’s not one of them (England players) who’s even remotely intimated that they want to miss this weekend,’ said O’Shea, while admitting that the strain on Robshaw and Brown is extreme.

‘It’s the two boys who have played four lots of 80 minutes. Robbo knows when he’s booking his week’s holiday and Mike knows he’ll get the same.

‘I think Robbo had a spa treatment yesterday and he’ll get a week off somewhere sunny, probably in the new year. It is still early in the season. I will give the players a week off after the Six Nations.’

Robshaw already knows when he'll get a week off 'somewhere sunny' after the Six Nations, says O'Shea

Quins captain Marler was at the spearhead of England's scrum dominance of Australia at Twickenham

O’Shea, who is known as a strong supporter of player welfare, added: ‘Is it something I think should be looked at? Yes, because it’s a ferocious schedule, but we have massive ambitions as a club.

‘These are big games to be involved in and the players want to be part of that.’

In contrast, Wales captain Sam Warburton will miss Cardiff Blues’ European Challenge Cup match with London Irish on Saturday because of a slight shoulder injury suffered in the 12-6 win over South Africa last weekend.
