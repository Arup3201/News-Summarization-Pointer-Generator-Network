A Supreme Court jury has toured the former home of accused killer Gerard Baden-Clay and the site where his wife's body was found.

Jurors spent almost an hour at the Kholo Creek Bridge at Anstead in Brisbane's west on Monday morning.

The body of 43-year-old Allison Baden-Clay was found on the creek bank, below the bridge on April 30, 2012, 10 days after her husband reported her missing.

Police blocked traffic from entering the two-lane bridge as jurors peered over the side to see the area where a kayaker spotted Mrs Baden-Clay's remains more than two years ago.

To get on to the bridge they had to pass a stone memorial for Mrs Baden-Clay where people had placed pots of yellow flowers, to match the mother-of-three's favourite colour.

The jury was accompanied by presiding judge Justice John Byrne and lawyers for the defence and prosecution, as well as court staff.

They then travelled by minibus to the Baden-Clay's former house at nearby Brookfield, where according to the Crown case, something happened to Mrs Baden-Clay on April 19, 2012.

They spent about 25 minutes touring the former residence, a Queenslander set back from the busy road that is now part of the childcare centre next door.

A faded plastic bunch of yellow flowers and a plastic wreath hanging on the front fence were the only signs the house once belonged to the Baden-Clays.

The fading blue paintwork has been replaced with fresh cream and brown colours and the trees and shrubs that once hid the house from the road have mostly been cleared.

The jury was then driven past the homes of neighbours who testified to hearing noises coming from the Baden-Clay's home on the night of April 19, 2012.

Baden-Clay, a real estate agent, has pleaded not guilty to murder.

More than 50 witnesses have testified during his trial, which has entered its third week.

The jury will return to court on Tuesday for more witness evidence.

The jury are taken to Kholo Creek, where Allison Baden-Clay's body was found
