'A lot in common': John Cleese with fourth wife Jennifer (left) and 30-year-old daughter Camilla

By her own admission, she and her father don’t always see eye-to-eye when it comes to her work.

And when John Cleese’s daughter Camilla unveiled her latest stand-up show, it wasn’t difficult to see why.

The 30-year-old comic devoted almost half of her set to making jokes at the expense of her 74-year-old father – and his wives.

As well as describing the Monty Python star’s current wife Jennifer Wade, 42, as ‘a child’ and his ‘soul mate du jour’, Miss Cleese referred to his third wife, Alyce Faye Eichelberger, as ‘Lucifer’, or the devil.

She also likened her family to tumbleweed ‘rolling along picking up dirt and debris’.

Miss Cleese – whose mother is the late American artist Barbara Trentham, her father’s second wife – told a sold-out crowd at Edinburgh Fringe Festival: ‘I’m still single and it’s weird because my parents set an amazing example.

‘They’ve been married for almost 42 years – to seven different people. Not at the same time, we’re not Mormon or anything like that, not even close.

‘If most people have a family tree, we have a family tumbleweed, it just keeps rolling along picking up dirt and debris, nobody knows how they are related to anyone else, we just know not to f*** each other, because we’re not Mormon.’

The 6ft 1in comedienne then turned her attention to Miss Wade, who became Cleese’s fourth wife two years ago, saying:  ‘Recently I got a surprise, we got a new child in the family, it’s pretty cool, my new step-mum.

‘My dad, about two years ago, married 
lucky number four, his soulmate du jour. She’s great, we actually have a
 lot in common – we’re both six foot, blonde and inappropriately aged to
 be married to my dad. But she’s really nice and I’m not, so that’s 
different.’

Miss Cleese saved some particularly barbed jibes for Miss Eichelberger, 69, who she dubbed ‘Lucy … fer’ – leaving the audience in no doubt that she was making a reference to Lucifer, or Satan.

Miss Eichelberger’s £12million settlement in her 2008 divorce from Cleese forced the comedian to come out of retirement and launch his Alimony Tour, and Miss Cleese has previously accused her of driving a wedge between her and her father during their marriage.

While Miss Cleese couched her jokes about Miss Wade in some compliments, no such courtesy was reserved for Miss Eichelberger during the 11-minute set on Wednesday night.

She said: ‘Because [Miss Wade] is now officially a Cleese, I call her the worst possible thing a 30-year old-woman can call a woman in her early 40s in public: mum.

‘She is so much cooler than the last one. Her name was Lucy … fer. She was a treat.

‘She had two sons who were both horrible people and they were up in Texas, it’s weird,  we have nothing in common,  we were related I guess but not any more.

‘One of them, Martin, he’s colour blind, he can’t see colour at all, don’t get me wrong, he’s super racist. He’s just red-green colour blind, I guess he just sees shades of grey, so to him, Christmas is just one big f*** you.

‘So, a few years ago for Christmas I gave him a Rubik’s cube, now he thinks he’s like  world champion, he tells everyone that.

‘I guess it just p***** me off because my parents have always said he was the gifted one and it’s messed up because if you think about it people say a child is a gift, right? So, technically, all children are gifted, even me.’

The comedienne – she is a regular on the US stand-up circuit but this is her first UK show – has collaborated with her father on several occasions, co-writing a stage version of his hit 1988 film A Fish Called Wanda and also his 2011 Alimony Tour.

However, her deeply personal new material might explain why, in a recent interview, she revealed that her stand-up is the ‘one thing [she and her father] don’t always see eye-to-eye on’.

Miss Cleese has previously discussed 
how she was a ‘nightmare’ teenager, falling from  being a top student 
and champion show jumper to being a homeless addict.

It
 took ‘five-ish’ trips to rehab and a tough-love approach from her 
parents – Cleese cut off all support and contact from his daughter – 
before she finally gave up alcohol and rebuilt her life.

Although Miss Cleese was born in the UK, she has spent much for her life in America and currently lives in Los Angeles.

Her
 latest show, American … ish, consists of four US-based comedians 
performing short sets. It runs every night at the festival until next 
Wednesday.

She made a 
tentative start to her comedy career, aware that she was receiving more 
scrutiny than her peers because of her father.

But things are speeding up and she is due to begin shooting a film, Bachelorette Weekend, later this year.

Camilla Cleese

Her father has had four wives – Fawlty Towers actress Connie Booth, then Miss Trentham, Miss Eichelberger and now Miss Wade

Miss Cleese’s mother Miss Trentham had three husbands. Before Cleese, she married Giles Trentham, a fellow student at Oxford University, and retained his name after their divorce in 1970.

Her marriage to Cleese broke down in 1990, and she later tied the knot again with barrister George Covington.

Miss Cleese has one biological sibling, her half-sister Cynthia Cleese, 43, from Cleese’s marriage to Miss Booth.
