Heroic: 27-year-old Mark Wright died in the botched operation in Helmand province in September 2006

Defence chiefs have gagged soldiers from talking about a botched Afghan rescue mission portrayed in a new film.

An official letter warns servicemen not to discuss the RAF’s controversial role in the 2006 operation to save paratroopers stranded in a minefield.

Personnel have also been ordered not to wear their uniform to the cinema to see the film Kajaki: A True Story – and banned from talking about whether the Army should have given more support to filmmakers.

The letter, issued by the Parachute Regiment and seen by the Mail, reveals how Ministry of Defence bosses refused to back the film, despite originally saying they would.

Last night Labour defence spokesman Vernon Coaker accused the MoD of imposing ‘draconian rules’, adding: ‘It’s totally unnecessary and mind-bogglingly illogical.’ 

The film, released yesterday, tells how one soldier died and six others were injured during an operation in Helmand province in September 2006. 

Paratroopers were injured by explosions when they became stranded in an unmarked minefield during a mission against Taliban fighters near the strategic Kajaki Dam.

But further tragedy struck when the downblast from a hovering RAF Chinook helicopter sent to rescue them set off another mine, wounding more soldiers and causing fatal injuries to Corporal Mark Wright.

The 27-year-old from Edinburgh was posthumously awarded the George Cross for his brave attempts to save the lives of colleagues while suffering serious wounds himself.

At his inquest in 2009, the MoD was heavily criticised when a coroner said officials should ‘hang their heads in shame’ for failing to send helicopters fitted with winches.

The film was made after a plea by scriptwriter Tom Williams in the Mail for more British war films that celebrated courage –

Ahead of the film’s release, serving Paras were sent a letter saying they were free to attend screenings – but not in uniform. And it warns about voicing their opinions on the mission, asking them not to ‘actively engage’ with the media.

‘Please do not get involved in the whys/wherefores/what-ifs of the events of the day,’ it reads. ‘Please do not be drawn into a wider commentary on whether wider support should have been given by the Army/MoD to the film.’ Paras are also instructed not to be drawn into a wider debate on the Afghan campaign.

A relative of a Para who had received the letter said troops were ‘surprised’ by it, adding: ‘They wanted to go and show their support for a soldier who died fighting to save his comrades.

‘They are frightened, what have they got to hide? It is a film about heroism. This letter opens your eyes, it is all shrouded in secrecy.’

The letter also reveals how military top brass removed their support for the movie despite backing from Cpl Wright’s parents and former paratroopers involved in the incident.

Movie-makers Pukka Films were given permission by the MoD in the summer of 2012 to interview soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (3 Para). But in October 2013 the MoD reviewed the script and pulled their support. 

The letter read: ‘After careful consideration of the script, engagement with Pukka films and consultation with serving personnel involved in the incident, the Parachute Regiment, Army and MoD have concluded that they cannot support this film. Accordingly the Parachute Regiment, Army and MoD are not to be represented as supporting this film.’

However, it contradicts a Ministry statement last month that said it was ‘untrue to suggest the MoD has withdrawn its support’.

It is understood defence bosses considered the film to be ‘way off reality’ and showed the RAF and senior officers in a negative light.

Defence sources said: ‘There were issues with it – the RAF hit and the portrayal that officers were in the back in the operations rooms while the soldiers were taking all the risks, which couldn’t be further from the truth.’

An MoD spokesman said: ‘The decision not to engage with Pukka Films further was made for a number of reasons, principally the demands on the time of serving soldiers and resource limitations.’

Personnel have also been  banned from talking about whether the Army should have given more support to filmmakers. Pictured is Jar Head, played by Thomas Davison (pictured)
