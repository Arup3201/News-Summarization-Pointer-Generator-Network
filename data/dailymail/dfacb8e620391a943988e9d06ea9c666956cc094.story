The 13-year-old girl who was charged in relation to the bullying and ultimate suicide of a classmate spoke out today after charges were dropped to say she did nothing wrong.

Katelyn Roman and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, from Florida, were initially charged with aggravated stalking in the death of Rebecca Sedwick, 12, and were controversially named and shamed by Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd.

Florida prosecutors announced last night the charges would be dropped and today Katelyn and her family appeared on the Today show with their attorney Jose Baez to insist the teen did no wrong.

Lesson: When asked if she has learned anything from the experience, the teen said its not OK to bully and people should stand up to bullies before saying

Her father said: 'They had a fight at school and it was all
over with but to then turn around and say [Katelyn] bullied Rebecca was uncalled for 
and was it was uncalled for of Grady Judd to put her picture up there.

'Then I had people coming to my house and phoning my house and threatening me and my family. It was crazy.'

He also claimed his daughter did not write any of the messages she was alleged to have on Facebook, including telling Rebecca to 'drink bleach and die'.

'Katelyn never said any of that stuff.'

When asked if she has learned anything from the experience, the teen told the Today show she knows it's not OK to bully and that people should stand up to bullies before saying: 'I do not feel I did anything wrong.'

Baez, the lawyer who was behind Casey Anthony's acquittal, also said today the family are thinking of suing the sheriff for his actions.

'The family are extremely disturbed and we are
 looking into every possible remedy at their disposal. His conduct was 
reprehensible,' Baez said.

Suspended: Katelyn Roman, 12, left, and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, right, were booted from school after being arrested for reportedly stalking 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick until she committed suicide

Baez praised the decision to clear his client of any wrongdoing at a press conference last night.

‘We
 are very pleased that the State Attorney's Office, through hard work 
and through extreme professionalism, has decided to do the right thing,’
 Baez told the Sun-Sentinel.

Baez's
 juvenile client allegedly told the lawyer that she was sorry for what 
happened and referred to herself as a victim after her mugshot was splashed
 across newspapers and shown on TV, the New York Daily News reported. 

Sheriff Judd said that both girls are now receiving counseling to ensure they 'never bully anyone again'.

Baez
 called the sheriff’s decision to name the two underage girls 
'unconscionable' and ‘reckless', and warned that Judd 'should get a 
lawyer and a damn good one'.  

The girls are no longer in custody and will 
have have no further criminal implications related to the suicide of Rebecca.

It is not clear if the girl's grieving family will pursue a civil case against the formerly accused.

Mr Baez spoke of the unlikelihood his client would be found guilty in a court of law during a previous interview with CBS news.

'I represent people accused of crimes as 
well as victims of crimes. She falls under both categories,' he told CBS.

'My client has been the victim of bullying in
 the past and she is currently being bullied by the system.'

Both Ms Shaw and Roman were 
suspended from school for one year in relation to the incident, it is 
not clear how the state dropping all charges will impact that 
punishment.

A Polk County Schools spokesperson reached by MailOnline declined to comment on whether the formerly accused cyberstalker would be allowed to return to class.

A source close to the family previously said the girl's family are worried 
about their honor-student's chances of getting back into the public 
school system.

'There is no 
guarantee that after a year you are allowed back into the public school 
system and that is if you are acquitted of all charges even,' the source
 said.

All charges dropped: Defense attorney Jose Baez will soon announce that all charges against accused cyber bully Katelyn Roman are to be dropped

According to the 
source, Katelyn Roman had the third highest state testing score in Polk County
 a few years ago but now won't even be able to continue her education 
electronically.

The two girls were part of a group of 15 girls who were accused of tormenting Rebecca Sedwick at Crystal Lake Middle School in Lakeland, Florida.

Polk
 County Sheriff Grady Judd said Ms Guadalupe was singled out for arrest 
after she posted an insensitive tweet about Rebecca's death.

'Yes IK [I know] I bullied REBECCA nd [sic] she killed her self but IDGAF [I don't give a f***],' Guadalupe allegedly posted.

'We decided that we can't leave her out there. Who else is she going to torment, who else is she going to harass?' he said.

But
 Sheriff Judd also announced last week that the bullying may have only 
been one part of Rebecca's decision to commit suicide.

John Borgen, the 13-year-old boy at the center of this tragedy, told MailOnline that he feels partly responsible for the Ms Sedwick's death.

Mr Borgen had dated Ms Sedwick before dating Ms Shaw, causing a rift between the trio.

'Guadalupe did not like the fact that I still liked Rebecca,' said the teen boy, 'that I still liked Rebecca and that I'd talk about her.'

The teen lamented that the extent of the torture Ms Sedwick was put through has devastated him, and that he wished Ms Sedwick had spoken up about Ms Shaw's tormenting.

'She never said anything to me, not a word. The only person she told was her mother.'

'If I'd have known I could have said something,' he added. 'I miss Rebecca.'

Roman was once Rebecca's best friend, but officials said Shaw turned her against Rebecca. 
Other girls also stopped being friends with her in fear of being 
bullied, the sheriff said.

'Several
 students corroborated stories of both girls bullying Sedwick on 
different occasions, through name-calling, intimidation, threats to beat
 her up, and at least one actual physical fight,' the sheriff said.

It is believed the bullying started when Guadalupe started dating Rebecca's ex-boyfriend.

Witnesses
 told investigators she sent messages to Rebecca, calling her ugly, 
telling her to 'drink bleach and die', and encouraging her to kill 
herself.

Rebecca's computer 
searches revealed she had searched for ways to commit suicide and asked 
questions like, 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl' .

One of the Florida girl's screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting on a railroad track.

She changed one of her online screen names to 'That Dead Girl.' She messaged a boy: 'I'm jumping.'

Polk County Sheriff Judd said Rebecca had been 'absolutely terrorized' by the other girls.

'We can see from what we've been investigating so far that Rebecca wasn't attacking back,' Judd said.

'She
 appeared to be beat down. She appeared to have a defeatist attitude. 
And quite frankly, the entire investigation is exceptionally 
disturbing.'

Even when her mother took Rebecca out of school, the bullying was carried out online.

The
 bullying started over a boy last year at Crystal Lake Middle School and
 at one point she was suspended for fighting with another student - 
believed to be Katelyn.

Last
 December, Rebecca was hospitalized for three days after cutting her 
wrists because of what she said was bullying, according to the sheriff.

'When
 she was being bullied at Crystal Lake Middle, she used to come home 
every day and tell me how she wasn’t worth anything, that she was ugly, 
how she was stupid,' her mother Tricia Norman said after her death.

'And
 I said, ''Baby what on earth would make you think that? You’re the most
 beautiful person I know and the smartest person I know.'

to all parents to be vigilant

'She put on a perfect, happy face. She never told me,' Tricia Norman told the Lakeland Ledger.

'I never had a clue. I mean, she told me last year when she was being bullied, but not this year, and I have no idea why.'

Once
 police checked her cell phone they discovered that the bullying had not
 stopped, especially on Kik Messenger, Instagram and Ask.fm.

'They would tell her she's ugly, stupid, nobody liked her go kill herself,' Ms Norman said.

She has started a Facebook page to try to fight back against online bullies, called Rebecca Sedwick Against Bullying.

Ms Norman told 10 News she was inspired to start it after reading her daughter's journal.

In
 it, Rebecca had written: 'Every day more and more kids kill themselves 
because of bullying. How many lives have to be lost until people realize
 words do matter?'

Ms Norman
 wants online bullies to face harsher consequences, and begged other 
young victims to stay strong and seek help, adding: 'Don't ever give up,
 like Becca did.'
