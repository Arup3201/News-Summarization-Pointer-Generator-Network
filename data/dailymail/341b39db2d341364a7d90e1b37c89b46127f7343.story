The study involved 1.5 million people in Ontario, Canada, and the statins involved were fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin

People taking statins face an increased risk of developing diabetes, warn researchers.

They found a 10 per cent extra risk linked to taking simvastatin – the most commonly prescribed anti-cholesterol drug – which rose to 22 per cent for those taking atorvastatin.

Previous research into a suspected link with statins found a 9 per cent rise in the chance of patients developing diabetes, but the new study looked at specific brands of drug.

The study involved 1.5 million people in Ontario, Canada, and the statins involved were fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin.

Researchers identified 471,250 patients with no history of diabetes and 
who were newly treated with a statin, just over half were women and all 
were at least 66 years old.

Statin therapy was started between 1997 and 2010 and individuals were 
followed for a maximum of five years following the initiation of 
statins, whichever came first. The Statins included in the study were: 
fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and 
rosuvastatin.

The research used pravastatin-treated patients as the comparison group 
as this has been shown to have favourable effects on newly diagnosed 
diabetes in animal models and clinical trials.

The overall risk of developing diabetes was low but this risk was increased among some patients taking statins.

The study found between 162 and 407 patients would have to be treated 
with the various statins for one extra patient to develop diabetes.

Patients treated with atorvastatin had a 22 per cent increased risk of 
new-onset diabetes, rosuvastatin an 18 per cent increased risk and 
simvastatin a 10 per cent increased risk, relative to pravastatin.

In contrast, patients treated with fluvastatin were at a five per cent lower risk and lovastatin a one per cent decreased risk.

The findings also suggest older patients are at an increased risk 
regardless of dose for atorvastatin and simvastatin or whether therapy 
is used for prevention in people thought likely to develop heart disease
or to stop it worsening.

The researchers say several factors may explain the increased risk of 
new-onset diabetes among patients receiving certain statins including 
impaired insulin secretion and inhibited insulin release.

The researchers said doctors should consider risk when prescribing 
statin therapy and they may want to switch patients to a ‘low-risk’ 
type.

Previous research into a suspected link with statins found a 9 per cent rise in the chance of patients developing diabetes, but the new study looked at specific brands of drug

Experts say the absolute risk of diabetes is low - far lower than the benefits of statins in cutting heart attacks and deaths.

More than eight million adults take statins, with most taking 20-40 mg 
of simvastatin a day. They are the most widely prescribed drugs in the 
UK, with about 61 million prescriptions in England alone in 2011.

Maureen Talbot, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, 
said: 'Statins are taken safely by millions in the UK and protect those 
at high risk of developing coronary heart disease.

‘Although this study suggests an increased risk of older people 
developing diabetes when taking certain statins, other risk factors like
being overweight, family history and ethnicity may have played their 
part.

‘There are benefits and risks with all medicines so if you’re worried, 
discuss your concerns with your GP. In the meantime, getting plenty of 
exercise and eating healthily will reduce your risk of developing both 
diabetes and coronary heart disease.'
