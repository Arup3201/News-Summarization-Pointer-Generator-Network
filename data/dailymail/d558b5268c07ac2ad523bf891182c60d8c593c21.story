Covered in scars and bruises or held in a vice like grip by an unseen male, these are not the kind of profile pictures Tinder users are used to seeing.

But the popular dating app has become the latest platform used to raise awareness of the growing problem of sex trafficking.

The women pictured are in fact actresses who are posing as victims. Users are able to scroll through several shots of them before seeing a message which reveals the campaign behind the pictures.

Tinder campaign: The fake profiles feature actresses posing as victims of sex trafficking in an attempt to raise awareness of the issue 

Raising awareness: Each profile ends with a stark message 'Sex trafficking victims have no options. You have an option to help end it now'

'Your options are left or right,' the message reads, 'sex trafficking victims have no options. You have an option to help end it now.'

'Made up to work here, but too young to be there,' reads another profile featuring a heavily made-up adolescent looking girl. 

The campaign has been launched by Immigrant Council of Ireland and advertising agency eightytwenty to attempt to bring home the reality of modern day slavery.

With human trafficking now the second largest criminal activity in the world, it is increasingly common in the West.

The International Labour Organization estimates that there are over 1.5 million victims of forced labour in developed economies and the European Union.

A recent Association of Chief Police Officers report found over 2,212 brothels just in London with an estimated 50 per cent of the women working in them believed to be victims of trafficking.

One of the many profiles created for the campaign shows a women being held down by an unseen male 

Speaking about the innovative campaign, Cathal Gillen of eightytwenty says: 'This is the first use of Tinder in Ireland for a campaign of this nature and one of the first globally. 

'Tinder has become an extremely popular app in Ireland, and it provides us with a unique, innovative and stand out way of communicating to men the issues faced by women involved in sex trafficking'

So far the organisation is reporting a good response to the large number of fake profiles they have set up.  

The NCA’s United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre (UKHTC) estimates that 2,744, people, including 602 children, were potential victims of trafficking for exploitation in 2013.

This represented an increase of 22 per cent on 2012.

The report lists the 10 most common countries of origin for victims, which shows Romania as the most prevalent country overall, and Poland as the most likely nation for labour trafficking.

The number of British victims increased 124 per cent to 193, of whom three quarters had been trafficked around the country for sexual exploitation.
