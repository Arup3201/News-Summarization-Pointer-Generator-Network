Ms Griffin said: 'If you think 'I'm going to apologise for trying to go down on Anderson you are mistaken'

Unrepentant comedienne Kath Griffin has publicly announced she has no intention of apologising for simulating oral sex live on CNN.

US television watchdog said yesterday that Griffin 'had shown increasing contempt for the CNN audience', after shocking viewers during the New Year's Eve show with behaviour branded 'vile' and 'putrid.'

Despite the backlash, the presenter and actress went on the David Letterman show last night and said: 'If you think this is the part where I’m going to apologise 
for trying to go down on Anderson Cooper you are sorely mistaken.'

She added: 'I tried, ladies and gays, I tried for you.'

David then grilled her and asked: 'Let’s say a man on television did that to you. What would your reaction be?'

To which Kathy quipped: 'If it was Anderson Cooper, 
myself and every other gay guy and woman, I’d unzip so fast.'

The comic, known for her 
unpredictability on TV, had cracked a string of 
lewd jokes that left viewers flabbergasted on New Year's Eve.

Before the show had even begun, Anderson -
predicting Kathy would get up to her usual behavior - tweeted: 'As 
always, I await New Year's Eve with 
Kathy Griffin with grave reservations and tremendous fear, and I want to
apologize in advance to anyone she may offend/assault/attempt to kiss.'

Letterman asked her what her reaction 
would be if a man did that to her on television, to which she replied: 
'If it was Anderson Cooper, 
myself and every other gay guy and woman, I’d unzip so fast.'

unpredictability on TV, has a history of cracking
lewd jokes on television

Should Kathy Griffin apologize for simulating oral sex with Anderson Cooper on TV?

She lived up to expectation, referring to co-host Anderson Cooper's 'sack' and called the fiscal cliff 
negotiations in Washington the 'fisting cliffs'.

About ten minutes into the program, 
the 52-year-old  told the CNN host she was going to 'tickle his sack'. 
As he giggled nervously back, Kathy quipped, 'You can say sack, that's 
not bad.'

Trying 
to cover her tracks, Cooper said: 'I don't know what you're talking 
about. I have no sack of gifts here,' to which Kathy responded, 'You're 
calling your privates your Christmas presents?'

But it was after midnight in New York's Times Square that things started to get really racy.

National
correspondent Gary Tuchman reported live from Eastport, Maine, where 
the custom on New Year's is to kiss a statue of an eight-foot sardine 
that they drop from the town's museum.

As
the people of Eastport kissed the sardine, Griffin dropped to her knees
in New York's Time Square and kissed Cooper's crotch over and over 
again.

Once again, trying to cover up the 
lewd act, Anderson asked her if she dropped something. 'No I was kissing
your sardine,' she replied.

Parents Television Council president Tim Winter told TMZ on Wednesday that Griffin 'has shown increasing contempt for the [CNN] audience'

As he tried to lift her to her feet, Kathy continued to try to kiss his crotch saying: 'I can do this all night long' and 'I'm going down. You know you want to.'

The action only stopped when they cut to Brooke Baldwin in New Orleans.

By the morning, Twitter and 
other social networking sites exploded with comments blasting Griffin's 
behavior and CNN for allowing her to host the show again when she has a 
history of outrageous behavior.

Darcy
tweeted: 'I see tasteless, classless fame-whore @kathygriffin was once 
again a guttersnipe in search of 15 minutes more on @cnn last night. 
Gak.'

Dan Strnad 
wrote: 'A child mimics a gun with his fingers and he's kicked out of 
school. Kathy Griffin kisses Coopers crotch on live TV and it's funny.'

Parents Television Council president Tim Winter told TMZ on Wednesday that Griffin 'has shown increasing contempt for the [CNN] audience.'

He says that it's now up to the network to dump the comedienne before she tries to trump her own performance next year.

Mr
Winter told the site: 'The onus is now on CNN.  Either the network has a
policy that allows its on-air talent to fondle a co-anchor's genitals, 
or it has a policy that forbids such conduct.'

The sex simulation adds to a long list of inappropriate gaffes by Griffin.

In
2008 she directed a graphic oral sex insult to a heckler. In 2009 she 
dropped the F-bomb and last year she stripped down to her underwear.

If male co-host had pulled same stunt on her she would have 'unzipped'
