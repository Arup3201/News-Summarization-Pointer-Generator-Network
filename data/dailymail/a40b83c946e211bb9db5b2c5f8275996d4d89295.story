For years, the Mediterranean diet with plenty of olive oil and vegetables has been lauded as the key to health and longevity.

But it seems that a Scandinavian nation's cuisine could actually be better for you.

Scientists have found that eating a diet based on that served up traditionally in Denmark could significantly reduce your risk of heart disease.

Nordic cuisine is usually made up of fresh berries, fish and game - foods that thrive in colder northern climates.

Obese people in a study who ate a diet packed with fresh berries saw their cholesterol drop by 4 per cent

Professor Matti Uusitupa, from the University of Eastern Finland,told The Daily Telegraph: 'The Mediterranean diet, representing the diet traditionally eaten in southern Europe, has long been related to improved health and prevention of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and type two diabetes.

'Acceptance of the Mediterranean diet has not been easy in other parts of the western world, probably due to difficulties in changing dietary patterns, cultural differences in taste and limited accessibility to various foods.

'A health-enhancing regional Nordic diet has therefore been proposed as an alternative to the Mediterranean diet.'

The diet has already been nicknamed the Noma diet - after the Noma restaurant in Copenhagen, ranked as the world's best three years in a row.

The study featured 166 obese people from Finland, Denmark, Sweden and Iceland, some of whom ate their regular diet and some who adopted the Nordic diet.

Both sample groups ate the same number of calories but those on the Nordic diet ate meals packed with fish, locally sourced vegetables and whole grain products.

Poultry or game was consumed rather than red meat.

While those who stuck to their 
regular diet showed little difference in their levels of 'bad' 
cholesterol after 24 weeks, those on the Mediterranean diet had seen 
LDL-C levels drop four per cent with an increase in 'good' cholesterol.

Unlike
 the Mediterranean diet, the Nordic version also reduced chemicals that 
cause inflammation in the blood that are linked to heart disease.
