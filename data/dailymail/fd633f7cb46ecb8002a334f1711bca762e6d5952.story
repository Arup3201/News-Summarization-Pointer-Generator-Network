A man sleeping in the back of a moving truck was given a very rude awakening when he fell out of the vehicle and on to the busy road.

Nikita Bikov, 22, was dozing against the door of the truck when it came open - throwing him into the path of oncoming traffic.

Incredibly, he narrowly avoided being hit by cars on the motorway near Vladimir, in western Russia, staggering to the side of the road just moments after the fall.

The door of the truck (pictured right) opens, and Nikita Bikov (just seen hanging out of the vehicle) falls on to the motorway near Vladimir, Russia. Mr Bikov, 22, was dozing against the door of the truck on his way to work

Mr Bikov falls on to the road (pictured next to the truck) and into the path of oncoming cars, which swerve to avoid him. His friend, not realising what has happened, continues driving to work

His friend who was driving the truck did not realise what had happened and continued on his way to work.

Cars swerved to avoid Mr Bikov, who was left winded and sore from the force of the fall.

A nearby car had a dashboard-mounted video camera which captured the remarkable series of events.

Mr Bikov told local media: 'I was dozing against the door of the lorry while my friend Ivan Toukov was driving. 

'He was concentrating hard on the road I guess. Suddenly I felt the door of the cab fly open and the next thing I knew was I was heading for the asphalt.'

'I landed hard on my back and had all the wind knocked out of me and couldn't move.

'I was aware of these whooshing sounds - and I realised it was fast-moving traffic swerving around me to avoid hitting me.

Mr Bikov, winded and sore, slowly gets to his feet. He said he was 'aware of whooshing sounds' of oncoming traffic as he lay on the road. The events were captured by a dashboard-mounted camera in a nearby car

Mr Bikov staggers to the side of the road after his fall. His friend who was driving did not realise that Mr Bikov had fallen out of the vehicle until he arrived at work and saw that he was missing

'I managed to crawl to the edge of the road and sat there stunned. I wondered where Ivan was. He later told me didn't realise until he got to work that I'd gone.

'When he parked he asked me for a cigarette, and then realised I was missing.

Police spokesman Bogdan Polyakov said: 'He was a very lucky young man indeed - first to survive the fall from the truck, then to avoid being hit by the numerous cars and lorries that were travelling behind the truck he fell from.

'We gave him a lift to work where he met up with his friend.'

'He suffered no permanent injuries.'
