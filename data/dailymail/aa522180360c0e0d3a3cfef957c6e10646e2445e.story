Winds from Russia are forecast to freeze Britain until next weekend, capping a winter colder than almost every winter since 1995.

As snow and sleet  hit parts of the country on Saturday, the Met office warned that formation of icy patches overnight may disrupt travel on Sunday.

Freezing winds saw temperatures hover at or just above freezing, putting most of the country on a par with Hammerfest, in Arctic Norway, which recorded a temperature of 1C today.

Swathes of the north of England awoke 
under blanket of snow this morning, and the cold snap gripping the UK 
shows no signs of abating as forecasters predict temperatures could 
plunge as low as minus 11C in northern Scotland in the days to come.

Areas of high ground in the north of 
England could see up to three inches of snowfall this weekend, the Met 
Office has said, while biting north-easterly winds will make icy 
temperatures - already below average for this time of year - feel even 
colder.

Earsdon,
near Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, turned white overnight, and police in Northumberland have advised drivers to take care on the roads in the wake of the snowfall .

Many
secondary roads, particularly around Gateshead and Newcastle, had 
coverings of snow this morning, a force spokeswoman said, adding that 
motorists should watch out for icy patches on wet, slippery routes.

The icy temperatures saw water trickling from fountains in 
London’s Trafalgar Square frozen solid this morning, as light snow fell in the capital.

Temperatures
in Leek, Staffordshire, hit a low of minus 4C last night, while 
Aviemore, in the Scottish Highlands, recorded a teeth-chattering minus 
10 yesterday morning.

The gardener and writer Monty Don 
tweeted about the 'sharp, stiletto wind' adding to the chill, and 
Britons shouldn't hold out hope for any respite in the near future, with
forecasters expecting the cold snap to last for up to five days.

Forecasters warned today of possible travel disruption in the north east
and north west of England, with much of the region likely to see 
between two and five centimetres of snowfall.

Michael
Lawrence, from the Met Office, said temperatures across much of the country were hovering at 
or below freezing, creeping up to a maximum of 4C in the south of 
England.

A forecaster for MeteoGroup said eastern England and Scotland would experience small 
flurries of snow into tonight and tomorrow before temperatures become 
milder, with sleet expected tomorrow night and Monday morning.

Light snowfalls are expected in Kent, East Anglia and northern England 
tomorrow but will be confined mainly to hills in the north.

Maximum temperatures over the next couple of days are expected to be around 2C or 3C in England and 4C to 6C in Scotland.

The coldest areas will be in the east and south east, where winds coming
in from a north and north-easterly direction will cause cold, breezy 
conditions.

The MeteoGroup forecaster said: 'We're not going to see spring in any rush.

'It looks like next weekend there will be a few snow showers around and no warm, spring-type weather in the next few days.'

The icy wind has sent temperatures plummeting around the country in recent days.

Dubbed the ‘beast from the East’, the freezing air has been sucked in from Siberia and is causing temperatures to drop.

John Lee from Meteogroup
said: ‘At the moment we have a high-pressure
zone across Scandinavia and that is bringing in winds from the East, 
from Russia, and they are especially cold and people will feel the 
difference in temperature this weekend.’

Tonight is expected to bring a widespread frost and drivers have been warned to take care on untreated roads.

Mr Lee said: ‘It could remain very cold for the 
majority of next week.’

Today is expected to see the heaviest of the impending snow flurries.

Last week saw overnight lows of minus 8.3C recorded in Scotland while Cumbria tumbled to a chilly minus 5.8C.

Thousands of gritters are on standby to deal with icy roads and snow while railway operators are poised to de-ice trains.

Peter Box, of the Local Government 
Association, said: ‘Gritting teams will be out in force to try to ensure
main roads remain passable.

‘There are still hundreds of thousands of tons in council depots.’

As well as causing havoc for 
motorists, the sudden burst of freezing weather is causing major 
confusion among flora and fauna. Many plants and bulbs which normally 
begin to bloom by this time of year have failed to show, while some of 
those that have were killed by hard frosts and snow.

An annual Valentine’s Day flower count revealed that the number of plants in bloom was well down on last year.
