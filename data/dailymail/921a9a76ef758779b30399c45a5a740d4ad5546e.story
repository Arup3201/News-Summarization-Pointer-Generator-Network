Owners of Nobby beach holiday resort, on the Gold Coast, Queensland, are about to hit the jackpot after finally agreeing to sell the ageing properties as one.

For nearly 30 years property developers have been unsuccessful in their approach to purchase Nobby Outlook.

Now, almost 50 unit owners have decided to sell the iconic beachside resort built in 1966 due to ageing of the property and expenses needed to renovate.

For nearly 30 years property developers has been unsuccessful in their approach to the unit owners of Nobby Outlook

Bronwyn Bartal, the Melbourne-based chairperson of the body corporate, said she has many childhood memories at Nobbys Outlook unit and although she is sad to let it go, Ms Bartal understands it is time.

'Although we were reluctant we see it needs major renovation and it just can't go on into disrepair,' Ms Bartal told Daily Mail Australia.

'If you haven't been here it is very hard to appreciate what an icon it is.' 

Ms Bartal recalls developers in 1988 approaching the unit owners separately in an attempt to force them to sell. She said developers were calling the owners 'horrible', insisting they were trying to stop positive development.

The 7284 square-metre property features 46 apartments 

'I have always been pro-active about Nobbys Outlook because my mother always said "I am not leaving Nobbys - I don't care how much money they will get us for", so I always wanted it to remain in the family.

'She has now passed away and I thought she wouldn't like to see Nobbys in the state it is in now - it will take a lot of money to just repair the outside.'

'So we decided we would rather be involved  in the sale, rather than just letting it fall down.'

Ms Bartal said the owners could not afford to renovate the property and it into  four or five star class.

Watching the units fall apart prompted owners of Nobbys Outlook to seek a joint venture partner to redevelop the site or find someone to acquire the site outright. 

'We will wait and see what is proposed to us but we know this place has such a history so if it is a good offer we will take it,' Ms Bartal said.  

According to the Gold Coast Bulletin, in 2011 developers valued the site at more than $30 million but Ms Bartal said all the figures so far was purely speculation.

She said in 2007-08 there was an 'evaluation of around $19 million but that was far too low.' 

'Recently a beachfront unit block of 17 near Nobbys Outlook  sold for $12 million,' Ms Bartal said. 

Along from Ms Bartal's family, a number of others have had strong family ties to the property for generations.

The 7284 square-metre property features 46 apartments that were purchased for as little as $50,000 by unit owners.  

Jayde Pezet, of KM Sales and Marketing, is taking care of the sales and marketing process of Nobbys Outlook and said owners know it is time for this fantastic site to be redeveloped. 

'The owners as a group are prepared to be flexible in negotiations and are keen to consider a variety of options, including: participating in a redevelopment, ‘cashing’ out their investment or, an outright sale,' Mr Pezet told Daily Mail Australia.

Nobby Outlook is being sold by an expression of interest till October 17, 5pm.
