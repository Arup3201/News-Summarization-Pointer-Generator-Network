A Vietnam vet who has just days to live has one final wish - to find his rescue chihuahua Mr Cutie who ran away from home.

A neighbor was caring for Mr Cutie since his owner, John Simpson, moved to a hospice because his pancreatic cancer was in its final stages.

After visiting Mr Simpson at the hospice, the chihuahua dug a hole under the fence of their Holiday, Florida, home and disappeared on Sunday.

Man's best friend: John Simpson is desperate to hold rescue chihuahua Mr Cutie one more time before he dies

'That dog's never tried to dig a hole. 
Saturday was the first time I took the dog here to hospice. That next 
day, he got out. I really think he was looking for John,' Ann 
Marie Gemmel, who has been looking after Mr Cutie, said.

The little dog was wearing a red collar, but did not have any tags on. He was last seen in Moog Road, Holiday.

Mr Simpson had pancreatic cancer diagnosed last Thanksgiving, and was given only four to six months to live.

Since moving to a hospice a few weeks ago, Mr Simpson says the chance to see his dog had kept his spirits up.

'That's what I was living for, to go see him, he toldÂ Fox 13.

He said he is now clinging to life in the hope he will have the chance to hold his dog one more time.

'When you're growing up you're asked, "If
you could have one wish, what would you wish for?" Back in those days, I
used to say, "As many wishes as I could wish for." Now, my only wish 
would be for my dog to come home,' Mr Simpson said.

Since Mr Cutie went missing friends have put posters up searching for him around Mr Simpson's home.

But so far, no one has found the dog and, since he has been lost, the area has been hit by Tropical Storm Andrea.

As word of the Mr Simpson's dying wish spread however, a Facebook campaign by Life With Dogs has attracted more than 2,000 likes and shares as dog lovers join the search to find Mr Cutie.

'This is part of a project, the last thing on earth to do is to get my dog back,' Mr Simpson said.

'Part of me feels like I can go in peace if that happens.
