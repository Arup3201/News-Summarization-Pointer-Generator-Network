British and American forces landed Wednesday on Iraq's Mount Sinjar, but plans to airlift as many as 30,000 starving and dying Yazidi refugees thought to be stranded there are not likely moving forward.

That's because most of the people are no longer there.

Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement that 'there are far fewer Yazidis on Mt. Sinjar than previously feared, in part because of humanitarian air drops [and] air strikes on [ISIS] targets.'

Also helpful, he said, were 'the efforts of the Peshmerga and the ability of thousands of Yazidis to evacuate from the mountain.'

U.S. officials said Marines and special 
forces flew in on black hawk helicopters, and departed after spending 24
 hours assessing  the military situation and the potential for a 
civilian evacuation route.

Tens of thousands of people from the minority Yazidi population were trapped in the mountains of northern Iraq, but the U.S. government now says most of them have fled to safety and don't need rescuing.

Vacation: Obama risks looking aloof as Iraq burns, but he's sent 100 troops to Mt. Sinjar – are they 'boots on the ground'?

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told the Associated Press that it's now far less likely that American military personnel will undertake any sort of rescue mission.

Airdrops of food and water had sustained the refugees, he said. But the U.S. effort in Iraq is not over.

It is 
understood the American team on the ground is also guiding U.S. air strikes against ISIS 
fighters encircling the barren mountain. A British official  said a 
handful of SAS soldiers were also on hand to 'gather intelligence', The Guardian reported.

It is the first confirmation that international forces were on Mount Sinjar.

It was 
reported earlier that Obama is considering military options to 
help the refugees, who attempted to flee Iraq to avoid ISIS, a militant group that says it has established an 'Islamic state' consisting of parts of Syria and Iraq.

'There
 needs to be a lasting solution that gets that population to a safe 
space where they can receive more permanent assistance,' Ben Rhodes, 
President Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser, told 
reporters in Martha's Vineyard, where Obama is currently on vacation.

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Tuesday in France that world leaders should make the crisis a priority.

'I
 know it is the holiday period in our Western countries,' he told a 
radio interviewer,' but when people are dying, you 
must come back from vacation.'

Obama plans to return to the White House briefly this weekend, but has spent his time on the Massachusetts island golfing, beachcombing and dining – often with a retinue of fans in hot pursuit.

Rhodes told 
reporters the U.S. would consider using ground troops, but reiterated that the president has ruled out 'reintroducing U.S. forces 
into combat on the ground in Iraq.'

He insisted, though, that the deployment of 
troops to aid in the rescue of refugees would be 'different than 
reintroducing U.S. forces in a combat role.'

White House spokesman Eric Schultz also said during a press briefing on Wednesday that any rescue mission would not have an impact on whether 'U.S. forces are going to be redeployed in Iraq in a combat role to take the fight to [ISIS].'

 David Cameron, speaking after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting in 
Downing Street today, said tens of thousands of refugees risked dying of
 thirst after being trapped on a mountain side in northern Iraq

Mr Cameron declined to give any details of the mission – such as whether Chinook helicopters (pictured) are being sent to the region could play a role in any evacuation

Earlier, 
David Cameron had revealed Britain is working on plans for an international 
rescue mission to save the tens of thousands of trapped refugees left 
'exposed, starving and dying of thirst' on the barren mountain.

The
 Prime Minister returned to the UK from holiday on Wednesday morning after 
flying back from Portugal 12 hours early to chair an emergency meeting on
 the crisis in Downing Street.

Speaking
 after the Cobra meeting, Cameron said 'detailed plans
 are now being put in place' for an international mission to rescue the 
stranded Yazidis and that Britain would 'play a role in delivering it.'

It's now unclear what such a mission would entail, since most of those in need of help have gone elsewhere.

RAF
 C130 transporter aircraft have made several drops of 
humanitarian supplies to civilians trapped on the mountainside in the 
autonomous Kurdish region in the north of the country.

Tornado
 jets are due to carry out reconnaissance missions of the area, and four
 Chinook helicopters were yesterday sent to the region ready for 
possible deployment in Iraq.
