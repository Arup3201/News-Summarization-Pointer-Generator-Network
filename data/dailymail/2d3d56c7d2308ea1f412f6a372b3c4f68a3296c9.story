A four-star hotel in the heart of the New Forest National Park has been ordered to pay more than £20,000 in fines after hygiene inspectors found evidence of rat infestation in its kitchen.

The Crown Manor House hotel in Lyndhurst, Hampshire, chose to close down its kitchen twice in a month after inspectors found fresh rat droppings underneath and behind kitchen equipment, as well as gnawed eggshells and gnawed paper towels.

The hotel, which was fined £16,670 and incurred £4,326 in costs, pleaded guilty to five offences under the Food Hygiene Regulations at the Southampton Magistrates’ Court.

Fined: The kitchen of the Crown Manor House in Lyndhurst was infested by rats

Two of the offences involved the production and distribution of food in an area infested with rats.

Environmental health officers from New Forest district council visited the hotel in October last year following an anonymous complaint about the hygiene in the hotel’s kitchen. 

Inspection: The Crown Manor charges up to £144 for a standard double room

The Crown Manor House, which was established in the 15th century and charges up to £144 for a standard double room, received a food hygiene rating of zero - the worst rating under the food hygiene rating scheme.

A spokesman for New Forest district council said: ‘Evidence of significant rodent activity was found in the kitchen.

‘Fresh rodent droppings were found underneath and behind equipment as well as gnawed eggshells and gnawed paper towel.

‘Food was not protected against potential contamination.'

Following the inspection the hotel agreed to voluntarily close the kitchen and was allowed to reopen it after seven days.

But when inspectors visited the hotel’s kitchen again for a routine follow-up check, they again found rat droppings and the hotel again agreed to voluntarily close the kitchen until the infestation had been removed.

A hotel spokesman said the rats had come from a derelict building next door that had been empty for many years.

The building has since been restored and the hotel installed a new kitchen costing £150,000 as part of a major facelift, he said.

He added: ‘The new kitchen is fantastic and our food hygiene standards are very robust, especially as the former problem next door no longer exists.’ 

Edward Heron, Councillor at New Forest District Council, said: ‘It is totally unacceptable to allow rats into a food business.

‘Environmental health officers took necessary action to protect the health of customers and staff and I am pleased that The Crown Manor House Hotel has responded with improvements and received a food hygiene rating of four.’
