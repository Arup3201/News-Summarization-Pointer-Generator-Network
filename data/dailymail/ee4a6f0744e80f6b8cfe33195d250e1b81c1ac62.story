She has been dubbed the 'Runaway Bride' but Princess Charlene of Monaco wouldn't get very far trying to run in the high heels she wore to an athletics meeting on Friday.

The royal wore nude stilettos to watch the Herculis athletics meeting at the Louis II Stadium in Monaco, part of the Diamond League series.

On the warm evening, she kept cool in a pale jumpsuit and kept her look natural with minimal make-up and no jewellery save her wedding ring.

As a former Olympic swimmer, the 35-year-old is known for her love of sport and clapped and cheered as she watched the world class athletics with her husband, Prince Albert II.

She later took to the track to present medals to the winners and jokingly mimicked a running action when she saw photographers were snapping her as she crossed the home straight.

The princess is hoping she can put her 'runaway bride' tag behind her after last week speaking out on the speculation surrounding her wedding two years ago when she was seen crying as she made her vows.

Happy together: The Princess last week dismissed rumours she had cold feet about her wedding to Prince Albert II and she tenderly held his arm as they watched the athletics on Friday

On form: The royals watched Mo Farah break the British 1500m record

She said they were tears of happiness
and rumours that she had tried to flee after getting cold feet in the 
run up to the big day were 'categorical lies'.

In an interview with The Times she
explained of her tears: 'Everything was just so overwhelming and there 
were all the mixed emotions because of the rumours, and obviously the 
tension built up and I burst into tears.

'And then I burst into tears some more because I was thinking "Oh no, now the whole world has seen me cry".'

True to her words, the princess couldn't have looked happier with her husband on Friday. The couple were seen smiling and chatting as they shared a programme to follow the track and field action.

As they stood at one point, she tenderly looped her arms around her husband's, who looked smart in a suit and red tie.

The royal couple were treated to some exciting races including seeing Britain's double Olympic champion Mo Farah break the 1500m European record.

His time of 3 minutes and 28 seconds also broke the British record that has been held by Steve Cram for the last 28 years.
