Legendary TV host Johnny Carson once feared for his life from a Mafia hit after he drunkenly put the moves on a mob boss's girl at a celebrity hangout in Manhattan.

The iconic funnyman hid at home and was 'holed up in his UN Plaza palace for three days, missing three shows' after an underworld figure put a contract out on his head in 1970.

Carson's offense occurred at closing time at Jilly's Saloon on West 52nd Street and this colorful tale is the latest from the new biography written by his long-time confidant and lawyer Henry Bushkin.

Legend: Johnny Carson hosts the Tonight Show with guests Richard Pryor and a chicken. But a mafia boss wanted Carson dead when he chatted up his girlfriend in a Manhattan bar

Carson was at the lounge bar often frequented by Frank Sinatra and other stars when he singled out one woman for special attention.

'An attractive brunette at the bar caught Carson's eye, and he was doing his considerable best to convince her to leave with him,' Bushkin wrote in the book.

Unfortunately for The Tonight Show host, the object of his affections was not only spoken for but also seeing a shady character who was high up in the mob, as reported by the New York Post.

'And when her boyfriend – a major figure in the underworld – arrived, he was not grateful to Johnny for entertaining his ‘goomar' in his absence,' Bushkin continued.

The mafia man and his heavies lifted Carson off his stool and hurled him down some stairs before the bar owner, and Sinatra's friend, Jilly Rizzo stepped in to calm things down.

But the jealous mob boss wasn't finished yet, and he put out a contract on the TV host. That's when Carson sensibly hunkered down at home for three days.

The situation was only resolved when one of his agents made a deal with crime boss Joseph Colombo, who needed TV coverage of a Columbus Day rally by his recently formed Italian-American Civil Rights League.

Bushkin explained that 'Colombo was deeply, deeply disappointed that so far all of the [TV] networks had refused to cover the rally.'

'Soon an accommodation was reached. NBC News covered the rally, and Johnny could leave the apartment,' he wrote.

Elsewhere in the book, Bushkin has revealed the moment the notoriously mercurial star broke down in tears when he discovered his wife was allegedly cheating on him.

Having been roped into breaking and entering the secret Manhattan apartment of Joanne Copeland, Carson's second wife, attorney Bushkin and the entertainer discovered a virtual shrine of photographs to pro-footballer Frank Gifford - confirming Carson's greatest fears.

As Carson began to weep, Bushkin, who was aged only 27 during the clandestine 1970 raid recalls that the multi-millionaire television host's raincoat had fallen open to reveal a .38 revolver in a holster on his hip.

Now 70-years-old, Bushkin's revelatory tale is just one of many he recounts in his memoir, 'Johnny Carson', that charts the 18-years he worked for the comedian as his lawyer, wingman and fixer. It hits bookshelves on October 15th.

The pair were also great friends and Carson frequently referred to him as 'Bombastic Bushkin' in many of his opening monologues on The Tonight Show.
