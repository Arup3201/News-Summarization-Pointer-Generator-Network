Amid the destruction and devastation as Ukraine is gripped by widespread anti-government protests, love is clearly in the air.

One demonstrator wearing a helmet, balaclava and bullet-proof jacket proposed to his girlfriend on a street in Kiev close to Independence Square today, where the deadliest clashes have broken out.

In a set of images taken by photographer Oleksandr Stashevskiy, the man was seen professing his love for the woman with a megaphone - getting down on one knee as his comrades lit smoke flares.

during rallies earlier this year. They plan to get married on the 
barricades.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's 
president is to return from a short sick leave that had sparked questions
 over if he was taking himself out of action in preparation to step
 down or for a crackdown on the protests.

Viktor
 Yanukovych's office made the announcement about the president's return 
tomorrow the same day as protesters seeking his resignation held one of 
their largest gatherings in recent weeks.

About
 20,000 people were at the main protest site in Kiev's central square 
today. Mr Yanukovych's sick leave was announced Thursday, with his 
office saying he had an acute respiratory illness.

But some opposition leaders believed he was vanishing from the limelight in advance of imposing a state of emergency amid the deepest turmoil in Ukraine since the Orange Revolution in 2004-2005.

The protests, which are heading into a third month, began in late November after Mr Yanukovych backed away from a long-awaited agreement to deepen ties with the European Union.

They quickly grew to encompass a wide range of grievances after police violently dispersed some of the early gatherings.

During Mr Yanukovych’s sick leave, a sense of stasis set in and neither side showed signs of movement. But his return to work could bring new action.

‘Repression works in reverse. More people are coming to Maidan,’ said demonstrator Tamara Tribko, using the abbreviated name of the square where an extensive tent camp has been established since early December.

Top opposition figures spoke to the rally to urge supporters to push forward with their demands.

Arseniy Yatsenyuk, one of the protest leaders, emphasised the importance of obtaining the release of all people arrested during the protests.

‘We must free all,’ Mr Yatsenyuk said, adding that there were 116 people being held. ‘Freedom to every hero.’

Mr Yanukovych’s sick leave was announced the morning after the parliament voted to offer amnesty to many of those arrested during protests.

It was on the condition that demonstrators vacate some of the buildings they occupy in Kiev and government buildings elsewhere in the country.

The measure was greeted with disdain by protesters, who characterised it as the Government essentially taking hostages and then using them to try to negotiate concessions.

Kiev's city hall, which protesters have seized, is being used as an operations centre and dormitory key to supporting the extensive protester tent camp on the nearby Independence Square.

Another protest leader, former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, showed that opposition hopes for cooperation from abroad are high.

‘The crisis will end at last when under the auspices of the international community we will hold new elections that will stop the regime of Yanukovych,’ he said.

On Tuesday, parliament is expected to consider reforms to the constitution that would reduce some presidential powers and allot them to the prime minister.

Mr Yanukovych last week accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov, but has not appointed a new one.

Also today, authorities granted permission to a prominent opposition activist to leave Ukraine for treatment of injuries he sustained after allegedly being kidnapped and tortured.

Dmytro Bulatov went missing on January 22 and resurfaced a week later, heavily bruised and with part of an ear cut off.

The incident, along with the beatings of other activists, one of whom died, raised fears that government supporters are using brutal hirelings to intimidate the opposition.

Police had sought Mr Bulatov for questioning on suspicion of organizing mass disorder, but prosecutors said he was free to go today.

He was taken to an airport and Mr Klitschko said he would be flown to Latvia for treatment.
