'Wriggling': Miliband as Labour Party Parliamentary Candidate for Doncaster North in 2005

Ed Miliband has finally admitted that The Mail on Sunday’s account of his Mr Bean-type blunders when he lived with the family of a former Labour mayor is true.

In a speech in Westminster last week, the Labour leader tried to make light of his habit of getting into scrapes.

But his attempt to play down his ‘Calamity Ed’ image stalled as he made a series of eccentric and contentious remarks, including:

Miliband’s comments broke his silence after this newspaper’s serialisation of an explosive new book by Martin Winter, the former mayor of Doncaster.

Winter claims Miliband’s ‘clueless and arrogant’ behaviour while he lived with his family in the run-up to the 2005 General Election made him lose faith in him.

Miliband and his advisers initially dismissed the revelations as ‘ancient history’ – but it didn’t stop David Cameron, Boris Johnson and others taunting him.

It led to the Labour leader responding on Thursday in a speech to more than 200 people, including many of Britain’s leading political journalists, at the Commons.

He devoted a large chunk of his speech to this newspaper and Winter, admitted the reports were true, and even said he found the accounts of his bumbling behaviour ‘hilarious’. However, some members of the audience were mystified by Miliband’s attempt to laugh off the book’s extraordinary disclosures – such as the incident when he nearly killed himself when he accidentally set fire to Winter’s office and, inexplicably, bought the family a £25 Muslim prayer mat for Christmas to cover the hole burnt in the carpet.

‘They [the MoS] revealed how I gave Martin a Muslim prayer mat to cover up a singed carpet,’ said Miliband. ‘I just thought it was what we in the Jewish community call a nice piece of schmutter.’

There was laughter when he continued facetiously: ‘They [The MoS] got me banged to rights because this atheist Jew confesses tonight to being a secret Muslim. That was during my Islamic arsonist phase.’

But there were raised eyebrows when he compared his prayer mat gift to the attempt in 2011 by Right-wing US tycoon Donald Trump to smear Obama by suggesting he was a Muslim and not born in America. That incident caused outrage among Obama’s supporters. Miliband mused: ‘I was wondering, where have I heard that before about a political leader? I think Donald Trump is available to go in search of my birth certificate and prove where I was really born.’

Miliband confirmed Winter’s account, reported by The Mail on Sunday, of how he nearly missed a meeting with Gordon Brown when he locked himself into his own house.

He recalled: ‘Eventually – and this is true – I escaped through a window and therefore made history as the first person to make a break for freedom to get closer to Gordon Brown.’

He tried to ridicule one of Winter’s most damaging revelations, that Miliband told him in October 2007 – a year before the UK financial crash – that the British economy was about to ‘fall off a cliff’, and that Labour had wanted to call an early election to cling to power before voters found out. ‘I am apparently Mystic Mili,’ said the Labour leader sarcastically.

Mr Winter said last night: ‘Mr Miliband (pictured) can sneer all he likes. He cannot deny saying he knew the economy was about to fall off a cliff because he said it in my house.'

‘I kept the global financial crisis from everyone and revealed it to only one person – not the head of the World Bank, the IMF, or the governor of the Bank of England, but someone at the epicentre of global finance – the mayor of Doncaster.’

Mr Winter said last night: ‘Mr Miliband can sneer all he likes. He cannot deny saying he knew the economy was about to fall off a cliff because he said it in my house.

‘In mocking a local political ally he mocks all his supporters and his own town.’

Linking an emotional passage about his grandfather who died in a Nazi labour camp to the media’s role in the coming Election, Mr Miliband said ‘some tough stuff’ had been written about him in recent weeks.

He added that ‘truth-telling’ was part of the job of the press – as had been ‘very ably demonstrated by The Mail on Sunday’.

The killing of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists by Islamist terrorists in France underlined the need for a free press, he said.

But he went on to argue that he and other politicians should be taken more seriously by the media. Journalists should ‘report on what [politicians] believe’ and not encourage ‘cynicism’ by suggesting they had ‘base motives’.

Press and MPs alike were ‘custodians of politics and its reputation’.

One observer said: ‘It was entertaining, moving and cringe-making all at the same time.

‘He wriggled about knowing the economy was falling off a cliff in 2007. He seemed to say “poke fun at politicians – but not me”. Winter has got under his skin.’

Ed Miliband was presented with a light-hearted list of his top ten calamities when he lived with Martin Winter.

The ‘Top Ten Edisms’ – as the Winter family called it – were inspired by the Labour leader’s own description of incidents which occurred when he first became MP for Doncaster in 2005. They include:

In his book, Fallout, Mr Winter tells how he and his family got a unique insight into Miliband when he secured his selection as a Labour candidate.

‘We gave him the list of “Edisms” because he got involved in so many catastrophes when he lived here,’ Winter says. ‘It was like having Frank Spencer as a lodger. It was meant in good fun and Miliband joined in the laughter.’

THE 'EDISMS':

1. ‘Things like that always happen around me.’

Winter says: ‘Miliband candidly admitted he had a reputation for getting into awkward spots – usually of his own making.’

2. ‘No… I can’t smell burning.’

Winter: ‘This was inspired by the way we found him in a semi comatose state in the office in my garden, having set fire to the carpet. For a moment we thought he might be dead.’

3. ‘Tyson, Tyson, get down! Oo it bit me!’

Winter: ‘When Ed visited retiring Doncaster MP Kevin Hughes to ask for his support, Kevin’s Staffordshire terrier, Tyler – Tyson as we called it – attacked him. It ripped his jacket and he had to wave his arm around to shake it off.’

4. ‘Nice carp you’ve got there, Nora.’

Winter: ‘Ed asked local Labour councillor Nora Troops, a keen angler who had lots of photos of her with carp on the wall, to back him. I said, “What on earth did you say to her?” He said this.’

5. ‘Hi guys – am I Blair or Cliff?’

Winter: ‘He didn’t like Tony Blair at all and took the mickey out of him by doing an impression – “Hi guys, who am I?” – and when you said “Blair,” he would say, “No, it’s Cliff”.’

Ed Miliband mocked Tony Blair (right) in an impersonation that made him sound like Cliff Richard (left)

6. ‘I do have cultural reference points, you know.’

Winter: ‘We tried to help him connect to ordinary people by getting him to have a flutter on the Grand National or have the occasional pint, but he didn’t get it, and doesn’t have interests or knowledge outside politics.’

7. ‘John Prescott? A joke politician.’

Winter: ‘I have always rated John Prescott as someone who understands working-class people, but whenever his name was mentioned, Ed would scoff, “He’s just a joke politician”.’

8. ‘Help! I’m locked in my house and I’m meeting Gordon in 20 minutes!’

Winter: ‘Ed had to be rescued by my partner because he couldn’t unlock his own front door when Gordon Brown visited.’

9. ‘Has she really got 19 cats?’

Winter: ‘Ed had just been to visit a local Labour supporter and it was the first thing he said to me when he came back. It had us in stitches.’

10. ‘Did he just call me Jim?’

Winter: ‘We initially gave Miliband the code name Jim to conceal the fact that I was backing him as mayor – but Miliband blurted it out by mistake when we were in the pub.’

The Winters also chose two songs for a farewell party for Miliband – The Trammps’s Disco Inferno, with the lyrics ‘Burn baby burn’, and Smooth Operator by Sade.

Winter: ‘He was always telling us what a smooth operator he was – sadly he was too busy for the party to take place. He was in such a hurry to leave that he left some possessions behind.’
