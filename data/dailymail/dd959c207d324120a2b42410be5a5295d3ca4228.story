A shocking advertising campaign for fashion brand American Apparel has been banned for ‘sexualising school-age girls’.

Photographs of its ‘School Days’ range included a young woman bending over in an ultra- short tartan skirt with her white underwear on display.

In a scathing attack, the advertising watchdog labelled the campaign ‘gratuitous’ and ‘sexist’.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said ‘the focus was on her buttocks and groin rather than on the skirt being modelled’.

It also accused the firm of promoting seedy ‘up-skirt’ photographs – when unauthorised pictures are taken from beneath a woman’s skirt.

The brand launched its Back-to-School range earlier this month with the slogan, ‘Your first assignment is to dress accordingly.’

The campaign included pictures of a model bent over touching the ground, revealing her crotch and underwear, while another showed a woman bending over a red car in a thigh-skimming green tartan skirt and her buttocks on show.

The ASA said: ‘We considered the images were gratuitous and objectified women, and were therefore sexist and likely to cause serious and widespread offence.

‘Furthermore, we considered the images imitated voyeuristic ‘up-skirt’ shots which had been taken without the subject’s consent or knowledge which, in the context of an ad for a skirt marketed to young women, we considered had the potential to normalise a predatory sexual behaviour.’

The fact that the model’s face was not visible meant the public would ‘understand that the model was, or was intended to appear to be, a schoolgirl.’

The ASA concluded: ‘We considered the ads had the effect of inappropriately sexualising school-age girls and were therefore offensive and irresponsible for that reason too.’

They acknowledged that American Apparel, which is popular with teenagers, ‘had removed the images before we had contacted them’, but said they were ‘nonetheless concerned that the images had appeared in their advertising at all.’

Following objections, the firm quickly pulled the offending pictures from its Instagram account and website.

The company said the images were not intended to represent an underage model but had been ‘posted by a junior and relatively inexperienced member of their social media team’.

The rest of its School Days collection – featuring models in mini-skirts, knee socks and crop tops stood next to lockers – remains online.

American Apparel has also courted controversy previously over its promotional campaigns

Two garments are named ‘the Lolita skirt’ and ‘the Lolita top’, in a possible reference to the sexualised schoolgirl in Vladimir Nabokov’s novel ‘Lolita’.

Last year, the retailer was labelled ‘sexist’ and ‘sleazy’ for an advertisement for a unisex shirt which showed half-naked women alongside fully clothed male models.

The business now has 10,000 employees and 249 stores in 20 countries, including the US and the UK.

American Apparel (UK) Ltd said its images featured non-airbrushed everyday people ‘and their approach was not graphic, explicit or pornographic.’

The brand said ‘their models were happy, relaxed and confident in expression and pose and were not portrayed in a manner which was vulnerable, negative or exploitative.’

It also argued it was well-known for its provocative campaigns and customers were well aware of this before they chose to actively follow American Apparel’s social media accounts or browse its website.
