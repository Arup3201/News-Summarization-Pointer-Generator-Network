Britons get happier rather than grumpier with age, according to a new survey which reveals we find our greatest contentment at 58.

The research suggests that people in the UK finally manage to get the work-life balance right towards the end of their working lives as they hit a golden age of satisfaction when silver-haired.

The study, commissioned for the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, also found that the age associated with the greatest stress is 35 - as they juggle the pressures of a young family with a demanding stage in their careers.

Analysis of the study of 2,000 people found 58 was the age at which the highest proportion of people were happy with the balance of work and leisure, as well as feeling good about their lifestyle.

They were also more likely to have a proper lunch break and stick to their contracted hours rather than working unpaid overtime.

A third of those who took part in the survey, to mark the launch of the new Samsung model today, said they were unhappy with their work-life balance.

The biggest key to contentment was spending time with family, according to almost two-thirds (63%) of those who took part - while the second most important factor was doing a job they loved.

Financial worries were the biggest cause of stress.

Professor Cary Cooper, from the University of Lancaster, said: 'It’s little wonder that our 30s are so stressful as we try - sometimes desperately - to juggle high-pressure jobs and family demands whilst maintaining happy relationships.

The age at which people are most stressed was given at 35 when many men and women start a family but also have to meet the demands of high-stress jobs

'And then by the time we reach our 50s, we feel much more confident - allowing us to set the agenda when it comes to working hours and family life.

'It is also interesting to note that spending time with family and being in a happy relationship score most highly in making us feel happy, while money is the top source of stress.'

Marketing director of IT and mobile for Samsung, Ines van Gennip, said: 'It seems the old adage of "good things come to those who wait" is true, at least in life, with those aged in their 50s likely to be the most content. 

'In our fast-paced busy lives, finding the balance between work and life has never been harder so make the most of the time you have by being really organised.'
