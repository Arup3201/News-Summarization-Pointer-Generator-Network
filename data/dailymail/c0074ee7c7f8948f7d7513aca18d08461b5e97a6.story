An erupting volcano creates an awesome spectacle as it spits molten lava over a remote snow-covered forest region in the far east of Russia.

Tourists have flocked to witness the eruption of the Plosky 
Tolbachik volcano located hundreds of kilometres from the nearest 
residential areas on Russia's Kamchatka peninsula.

The shocking pictures shows thrill-seekers risking life and limb for a good picture, edging further and further backwards towards spewing lava.

Remote: The Plosky Tolbachik volcano is located on Russia's Kamchatka peninsula in the far east of the country

The volcano, which began erupting in November after lying dormant for almost 40 years, has unleashed huge jets of lava up to 200 metres into the sky.

Plumes of gas and ash have been sent into the atmosphere and a huge lava lake has formed around the volcano.

Both the Kamchatka and Kizimen volcanoes are also active on the same peninsula and seizmologists have been monitoring the situation carefully.

Chill factor: The area the volcano is erupting in is currently covered in a thick layer of snow with temperatures well below freezing

Rescue workers have now been drafted in to ensure the tourists do not get too close to the eruptions.

Photographer, Denis Budkov, witnessed the bizarre moment whilst exploring the Plosky Tolbachik volcano in the far east of Russia.

The 33-year-old, from Kamchatka Krai, who works as a guide at the site was so stunned by the scene he pulled out his own camera to take a picture.

Denis said: 'I was working my way around the volcano guiding a group of tourists, when I spotted the lady.

'I have been living near the volcano for a long time and have seen plenty of eruptions but never anything like this.

'This was my first time actually seeing the eruption and lava so close. I was completely overwhelmed.

'I'd never been that close to the crater before and I've never seen a fountain of lava like that. It was unforgettable.

'She was very brave but I'm sure it made for a spectacular shot.'
