Warning: Britain's status as a free-market nation is at risk from 'the forces of pessimism', Chancellor George Osborne will claim today

Britain's status as a free-market nation is at risk from ‘the forces of pessimism’ who are waging war on big business, George Osborne will claim today. 

An anti-business alliance of Labour and the ‘populist Right’ – a reference to Ukip – want to ‘pull up the drawbridge and shut Britain off from the world’, the Chancellor will say.

‘They want to constrain foreign investment in our economy, and deprive us of the British jobs that it has created in industries from car manufacturing to energy,’ he will tell the Confederation of British Industry.

‘They want to set prices, regulate incomes, impose  rent controls, wage war on  big business, demonise wealth creation, renationalise industries – and pretend that  they can re-establish  control over all aspects of the economy.

‘Whether from the Left or the populist Right, we now see a deeply pessimistic, depressing, anti-business agenda.’ 

Mr Osborne’s remarks are designed as a trenchant attack of the economic policies of Labour’s Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, who have unsettled business leaders with a series of 1970s-style policy proposals.

But it is also a provocative riposte to those in his own party and Ukip who have expressed concern about foreign take-overs – most recently the stalled Pfizer bid for British-based drugs firm AstraZeneca.

Mr Osborne is said to have been the leading Government champion of a controversial attempt by the US giant to merge with AstraZeneca.

The now stalled bid was prompted at least in part by UK tax breaks for businesses.

The Chancellor has repeatedly slashed 
the headline rate of corporation tax, despite the Government’s austerity
 measures, to encourage firms to invest in and move to the UK.

He will tell business leaders that Britain has been brought ‘back from the brink’ and hail a ‘real sense of optimism that is growing in Britain today’.

But he will warn that it would be a ‘grave mistake’ to think that repairing the economy is complete and the country can ‘go easy and slow down’. 'Our task to secure our country’s economic future is not even half done. 

‘This is a decade-long turn-around job we have embarked on – and we are determined to see it through.’

He will also highlight the cracks in Britain’s reputation as an ‘open, free-trading, free-market economy and a welcome home for business’ as a growing threat to the nation’s future prosperity.

For all of my adult life, since the fall of the Berlin Wall in the year I left school, there has been a  political consensus in this country that Britain’s future lies as an open, market economy,’ he will say.

‘Since then, under governments of all political persuasions, we have championed free trade – and welcomed  foreign investment – and built competitive, open markets under the supervision of robust independent regulation.

‘You [CBI members] know what a huge advantage it is for Britain that you can say that Britain is the most open, competitive economy in Europe – and that commitment to  openness, independent regulation, free and competitive markets existing regardless of the  political make-up of the Government.

'Sadly, that consensus that we put the national economic interest first – ahead of opportunist party advantage – is under threat for the first time in 25 years.’
