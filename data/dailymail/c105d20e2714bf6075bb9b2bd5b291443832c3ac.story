It might be without a creative director, but iconic British brand Mulberry does at least have Cara Delevingne on its side. The 21-year-old model, who is currently the face of the label, unveiled her first attempt at fashion design with a bag created exclusively for the brand.

Appearing centre stage on the catwalk in a simple white dress and flanked by a pair of red-haired male models, Ms Delevingne was cool and composed as she showed off the fruits of her first foray into design.

And while she might be famous for her quirky sense of style, it seems Cara Delevingne is no slouch when it comes to creating must-have bags. Although Mulberry's new bag is available in a limited edition lion design inspired by the model's tattoo, there were plenty of options for the sartorially shy on offer.

Bag lady: Cara stands centre stage with the camouflage haircalf version of Mulberry's brand new Cara Delevingne bag, which was designed by the model herself

Strutting her stuff: As ever Ms Delevigne appeared at home on the catwalk - even when, as on this occasion, her own designs are being revealed for the first time

The reveal: Cara appears on the catwalk to unveil her new bag which comes in three different sizes and three different materials

Stylish: The camouflage option is made from haircalf (calf skin) while the other two are made from natural leather or quilted nappa leather

Top of the class was the beautiful 
quilted nappa leather option, available in a range of colours but served
 up for the show in vibrant grass green. The natural leather looked 
slightly dull, particularly in the small size, but has the potential to 
look fabulous in a bigger size and more interesting colour. 

The
 final option was camouflage print in 'haircalf' - Mulberry speak for 
calfskin. This last is bound to go whizzing off shelves; an easy way to 
jazz up your look and a convenient size to boot.

So
 what did the model herself have to say? 'My Granny will like this bag,'
 she revealed. 'She’s 102 years old.' Bizarrely, she went on: 'My 
five-year-old cousin will probably like this bag. He’s a boy.'

If
 he really does, and great-granny too, then Cara really will have earned
 the right to add 'fashion designer' to her varied - and 
ever-lengthening - CV.

But while the model's foray into fashion design proved a hit, stylish eyes were also turning towards this afternoon's schedule, which includes Matthew Williamson, Topshop Unique and Vivienne Westwood.

SamCam's new wardrobe? First lady friendly frocks and a succession of crimson co-ords formed the backbone of the Preen show

Colourful: Tomato red was the hue of choice for the brains behind Preen by Thornton Bregazzi

Tailoring: Preen's outsize silhouette was once more in evidence

Bold: Print added interest to the collection's limited palette

Elsewhere, day three got off to a 
flying start with Preen, firmly established as one of London's hottest 
names by designers Justine Thornton and Thea Bregazzi.

On
 this showing, their reign as one of the capital's most exciting 
designer duos looks set to continue, courtesy of a show that combined 
gorgeous geometric prints with their trademark outsize tailoring.

The
 palette was kept minimal, focused on black, charcoal, cream and jolts 
of bright tomato red, but that certainly didn't mean boring. Highlights 
included a stunning shirt-waist dress, enlivened with print to hem and 
sleeve, and a tomato red tunic and trouser combo.

More
 co-ords followed - a trend that doesn't seem to be going anywhere soon -
 and some first lady friendly frocks, including a stunning cream number 
crafted from delicated lace and brightened with a panel of tomato red. 
Expect to see SamCam in it soon.

Just as diverting was the front row, which included 
Yasmin Le Bon and socialite Olivia Palermo.

Living
 dolls: Sophia Webster's dollhouse presentation saw models perch at 
primary coloured dressing tables and even relaxing in a bubble filled 
bath

Pretty: Powder pink and delicate pastels once again ruled the roost at Sophia Webster, a designer famous for her grasp of colour

90s
 cool: Webster showed that she's still a 1990s girl at heart, 
referencing the decade's penchant for houndstooth, extreme girliness and
 the odd bit of grunge

Following Preen was  Pringle of 
Scotland who showed a confident collection awash with muted nudes and 
beiges - all the better to show off some of the best tailoring of 
fashion week so far.

Also 
offering a clever approach to cut and finish was Margaret Howell whose 
thoroughly British basics included a beautifully soft blue Fair Isle 
knit and a sequence of librarian chic cream silk blouses.

Riffing
 on the librarian theme, Howell also showed a baggy olive trouser suit -
 perfect for stacking stray books in - and a succession of heavy velvet 
and whalecord skirts and dresses. Bookish it certainly was but boring 
not at all.

Another to take
 a cerebral approach was shoe designer Sophia Webster, whose 
presentation involved models clad in 90s sweatshirt dresses and 
houndstooth perched at lilac dressing tables and flopped, long limbs 
modestly crossed, in bubble filled baths.

While
 the set-up was eye-catching, it was upstaged by the shoes which for 
A/W14, included chunky fur-filled mules and delicate strappy sandals 
jazzed up with a fluffy heel.

Once
 again, powder pink proved a winner, with Webster splashing it onto 
shoes in the shape of pretty pastel pink hearts and fluffy pom poms to 
maximum girly effect.

Tour
 de force: Richard Nicoll proved yet again that he's a dab hand at 
tailoring with a very clever grasp of colour and silhouette

Stunning: Richard Nicoll's self-assured show emphasised, once more, why the designer is well worth a place at the top table of British fashion

Up next was another fashionistas favourite, Richard Nicoll, who, unsurprisingly for a man who earned his fashion stripes consulting for Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton, is no slouch when it comes to knowing what women want to wear.

The man who gave the world the one size fits all geometric print t-shirt dress was on winning form once more today, with a collection that combined relaxed tailoring with loose, wearable shifts and striking knife-pleat dresses.

Nicoll opted for a surprisingly summery palette, with powder blue and cheerful cerise domninant although there was the odd flash of mustard and cobalt.

In what has to be a first for a winter show, black and stark white were entirely absent, suggesting next autumn could be far more colourful than most expected.

Colour notwithstanding, highlights included a stunning knife pleat dress in petrol blue and white, and a gorgeously wearable cerise jumper teamed with a knife pleat skirt. On this evidence, summer's love of all things pleated will be with us well after the snow arrives.

Summery: Richard Nicoll showed tailoring in summery powder blue

Blues: Nicoll's penchant for blue also encompassed navy, cobalt and petrol

Cheerful: A simple knitted cerise dress was lifted with three simple rosettes
