A gang that deliberately crashed a 12-tonne bus carrying 26 passengers as part of a thousand-pound 'crash-for-cash' scam has been jailed.

Mohammed Omar Gulzar, 31, devised at least 39 collisions across South Yorkshire to claim up to £500,000 from insurance companies.

Working with a team of actors and fraudulent company City Claims 4 U, Gulzar filed dozens of claims for injuries such as whiplash for hundreds of pounds at a time.

The most elaborate stunt over the seven 
months between January and July 2011 involved Gulzar and his employee 
Shoaib Nawaz, 25, filling a single-decker First Mainline bus with 
co-conspirators, before driver Adam Herbert - who was in on the plot - 
deliberately crashed into a Vauxhall Safira.

Scam: Mohammed Omar Gulzar, known as Bobby, employed 25 people to file fake insurance claims after their bus collided with a Vauxhall Zafira in Sheffield, South Yorkshire

Genuine passengers were bemused as people threw themselves to the floor, and one man ran into the windscreen, after the low-speed crash, Sheffield Crown Court heard.

Afterwards, 25 people made claims for whiplash.

Sentencing the gang at Sheffield Crown Court yesterday, Judge Graham Robinson said: 'The idea that cash-for-crash is a victimless crime needs to be rebuffed immediately.

He added: 'The fact that this criminal enterprise was a failure does not make the offences less serious and the sentence I give will hopefully serve as a deterrent to anyone considering taking part in a cash for crash scam.

'Cash for crash is not a crime that pays.'

Gulzar and Nawaz were sentenced to four-and-a-half years and three-and-a-half years, respectively for conspiring to defraud insurance companies between January 1 and July 31, 2011.

Bus driver Adam Herbert, 26, was jailed for 20 months.

Gulzar, his employee Shoaib Nawaz, 24, and two other men - Javed Khan, 46, and Sami Selam, 36 - were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud following a six-week trial in September 2013.

Sheffield Crown Court heard police enquiries began after the smash at the junction of Scott Road and Ellesmere Road in Sheffield.

Enquiries by bus company First revealed that there had been a spike in passenger numbers on that particular day.

Police branded the 'crash for cash' scams, involving Osman Bakri (left) and Sami Selam (right), 'professionally-planned' and 'highly-organised'

Accounts of the collision given by bus driver Adam Herbert and the driver of the Zafira, Safaida Bi - also in on the scam - varied greatly, while genuine passengers were bemused by the actions of others on the bus.

One woman told police how following the collision, which 'barely made her sway', one man ran past her and headbutted the windscreen.

Another genuine passenger said that she was provided with collision report sheets prior to the crash even taking place.

The case - dubbed Operation Lollipop - led South Yorkshire Police to a Sheffield-based accident claims company City Claims 4 U, and Gulzar's fake hire-car operation, CCC Hire 4 U.

Officers worked closely with the Insurance Fraud Bureau, a London-based industry organisation, and FirstGroup to identify and gather evidence.

They identified suspects involved in ten 'road crashes' at Halifax, Sheffield and Rotherham between January 1 and July 31 2011.

DC Mark Wootton, who led the investigation, said: 'This was a professionally-planned, highly-organised group of individuals who set out to defraud a number of insurance companies by making deliberate false claims and pocketing the money for themselves.

'The fraud involved false claims for personal injury, vehicle damage, over-inflated recovery and storage costs, together with extortionate and false claims for hire vehicles from CCC Hire 4 U, a company owned and run by Mohammed Omar Gulzar.'

Bus driver Herbert, 25, pleaded guilty to fraud at an earlier hearing along with six other people.

Vauxhall Zafira driver Safaida Bi, 30, was given a three-month sentence suspended for 12 months and ordered to do 250 hours of unpaid work.

Saeeda Ali Bi, 40, was given a three-month sentence suspended for 12 months and ordered to do 250 hours of unpaid work.

Mohammed Abbas Jaffar, 25, was given a four-month sentence suspended for 12 months and ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work.

Saif Allah Kara Glenn, 25, was given a three-month sentence suspended for 12 months and ordered to do 250 hours of unpaid work.

Osman Bakri, 25, was given a four-month sentence suspended for 12 months and ordered to do 275 hours of unpaid work.

Dusan Pacan, 27, will be sentenced at a later date.
