Night after night, Barbara Paul would lie staring at her ceiling through the small hours of the morning. Sometimes the 63-year-old would recite the alphabet to herself over and over in an attempt to drop off, but it rarely worked.

Of course, surviving on as little as two hours’ sleep a night had a profound impact.

‘I began to dread bedtime, knowing what lay ahead. I felt so frustrated and it became hard to cope,’ she says.

Insomnia is a devastating condition that affects up to 30 per cent of people, but there’s a little-known trigger that causes it in women such as Barbara: the menopause.

Alongside hot flushes, memory loss and mood swings, sleeplessness is a surprising side-effect of the change, and one that causes misery to millions of women.

A recent study found that one in four middle-aged women aren’t happy with the quality of their sleep, while another major piece of research found menopausal women are nearly four times more likely to have insomnia.

And it’s not just irritating — lack of sleep has significant health implications and has been linked to obesity, high blood pressure, dementia and cancer.

Colin Espie, professor of behavioural sleep medicine at Oxford University, says: ‘The menopause or associated HRT treatment is a time of major hormonal, physical and psychological change so it can often be a trigger for insomnia. Levels of both the female hormones, progesterone and oestrogen, drop.

‘Progesterone is known as a sleep-promoting hormone, while the reduction in oestrogen can leave you more susceptible to environmental factors that can disrupt sleep, such as light.

‘Hot flushes with their surge of adrenaline and change in temperature can also disrupt your sleep.’

Barbara, a retired college principal who lives with her husband, Trevor, in Devon, started suffering from insomnia ten years ago.

‘It was around the time the menopause kicked in and I was suffering badly with hot flushes. I didn’t put two and two together — and there was no information that the menopause could cause sleeplessness.

‘I’d feel tired but then, when I got into bed, it was like a switch had been turned on and I suddenly felt wide awake. When I finally did get to sleep, I’d wake up again after two hours.

‘All sorts of ridiculous worries would come into my head. Before, I’d always gone to bed at around 10pm and slept through the night.’

The resulting exhaustion took its toll on Barbara. ‘When the alarm went off in the mornings, I felt so irritable. It made me clumsy, snappy and forgetful.

‘I had a very demanding job, but I felt so foggy and dazed that everything started taking me much longer to finish. And I started spotting mistakes in my work. One time I was driving and I had to stop the car because I felt so confused.

‘By the evenings I was just shattered. I’d go to the theatre and as soon as the show started, I’d be nodding off, no matter how good it was. I started staying in more.’

While she started HRT to battle the other menopausal symptoms, Barbara assumed she had to put up with sleeplessness.

She didn’t want to take sleeping pills so tried to find her own solutions — going for 15-mile walks once a week — but that didn’t work either.

The problem isn’t just dropping off, but sleeping through the night, too. One study found 60 per cent of middle-aged women wake in the night at least once a week. They are also statistically more likely to ask their GP for sleeping tablets.

This was the case for secondary school teacher Monica Troughton.

‘I always used to sleep like a log and would struggle to get up in the morning,’ says Monica, 60, a mother of two who lives with husband David, 61, an artist, in Leamington Spa.

‘Now, although I fall asleep easily at around 10.30pm, every night without fail I wake at three in the morning and cannot get back to sleep.’

All those hours spent lying awake started to take their toll.

‘I looked and felt awful,’ Monica says. ‘I just couldn’t think properly and would be crabby with David.

‘Sometimes, I’d wake him up in the night, which would really wind him up. I became anti-social because I was so neurotic about sleep — if people came round I’d worry they’d stay too late.’

Although Monica’s sleep problems started when she hit the menopause at around 50, they weren’t prompted by night sweats.

‘Thankfully, I haven’t suffered with hot flushes,’ she says. ‘So although I think insomnia is linked to the menopause, I wouldn’t say it’s confined to those who suffer from hot flushes.’

Formerly a writer, Monica started researching a book about the menopause: ‘I spoke to more than 100 menopausal women. Without exception, they all said they woke up in the night.’

Over the years, Monica has tried everything from acupuncture, hormone replacement therapy, hot drinks and herbal remedies — to no avail. At one point, she took sleeping tablets while on holiday despite an aversion to them.

‘I was worried about waking up in the hotel and not being able to roam around like I can at home,’ she says. ‘They knocked me out but I didn’t feel refreshed. I’d get quite tearful about it. The thing I hated most was feeling disorientated the following day.’

In the end, Monica learned to simply accept her fate. ‘I’ve found the best thing to do is get up and do something. It stops me panicking about how tired I’m going to be.

‘I’ll polish a mirror, read a book — I’ve even baked a cake. Now I understand that sleep patterns change throughout your life and the worst thing to do is panic about it because then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.’

Writer Jacqui Deevoy, 52, also tries to adopt a positive approach to menopausal insomnia. But there’s no denying the anxiety it caused her initially.

‘I used to be a really good sleeper and would boast about the fact I needed 12 hours sleep a night,’ says Jacqui, who lives in West London and has four children, aged from 14 to 25.

‘A couple of years ago, I started waking throughout the night — sometimes only getting three hours’ sleep. Although I didn’t suffer hot flushes, I knew it must be hormonal.

‘I still find that I just can’t sleep like I used to. Quite often I go to bed at 2.30am but am wide awake by 7am.

‘I tried taking herbal remedies but nothing made a difference.’

Like Monica, Jacqui has dealt with the lack of a cure by trying to accept the change.

‘The worst bit is when the birds start singing at 4am and you realise you’ve got to get up in a couple of hours,’ she says.

‘But I noticed that it was around this time that I started having epiphanies about aspects of my life. So I tried to think of the menopause as a positive change — perhaps I just don’t need as much sleep.’

Surely there must be something that can be done? Professor Espie says: ‘By far the most effective long-term solution is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).

‘It helps people to think and behave differently in relation to their sleep in such a way that normal good sleep can return. If you let your insomnia go untreated, it can continue long after the menopause has finished.’

As for Barbara, three months ago she read about an online self-help programme called Sleepio based on the principles of CBT.

‘For the first two weeks you fill in lots of questions about your lifestyle and sleep patterns, then you go on to a sleep deprivation programme. I wasn’t allowed to go to bed until 1am and had to get up at 7am.

‘That’s been one of the hardest things for me — it’s really hard not to nap. I realised that I’d got myself into a bad pattern of going to sleep in the day and probably going to bed too early, too.

‘I cannot tell you the joy I experience just from getting into bed, turning out the light and falling gently to sleep.

‘I still have my off days and I know I can’t cure it overnight. But for now, I’m delighted, and so is my husband, who’s politely said I seem to be much happier these days.’
