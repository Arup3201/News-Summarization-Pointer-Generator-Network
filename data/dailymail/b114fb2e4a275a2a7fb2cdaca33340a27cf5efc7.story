It's the first taste of the gourmet burger coming to a Maccas near you.

The world famous Golden Arches, best known for Big Macs, cheeseburgers and Happy Meals, is now serving up a gourmet menu it hopes will take the fast food chain upmarket.

You will even be able to build your own burger from scratch from a range of ingredients, while some restaurants will offer table service. To hold it all together, the burgers will even come with toothpicks holding them together, just like they do in more trendy eateries.

This new menu will be rolled out to McDonald's customers in Australia over the next six to nine months after the fancy new range was launched in Sydney on Thursday.

McDonald's Australia boss Andrew Gregory told Daily Mail Australia that customers have driven the overhaul.

The company is in the throes of a $1billion remodelling, which will introduce more of its Australian fast-food restaurants over the next five years.

The 'create your own gourmet burger' offers 19 different fillings served on wooden platters with a side of fries in a basket, complete with table service.

Customers can order their customised burgers on a digital touch-screen menu also offers up never seen before choices at McDonald's such as guacamole, tortilla chips and a range of other sauces.

The 'create your own burgers' range will be offered across Australia in the next six to nine months

Aside from the gourmet burgers, digital self-service kiosks and menu boards, McDonald's will also include home delivery as part of the service

Mr Gregory revealed there are plans for three more so-called 'Customer Learning Labs' will open this year, with a further ten planned in early 2015 before a full roll out.

The first at McDonald's to trial the revamped menu and service will be Castle Hill in Sydney's north-west.

'We will build another three of these before the end of the year and test and learn and listen to our customers,' he said.

'We plan to do it over the next 12 months in every restaurant around Australia.'

Aside from the gourmet burgers, digital self-service kiosks and menu boards, McDonald's will also include home delivery as part of the service. 

The fast-food chain previously released a jazzed up version of their burgers - the Grand Angus

'McDonald’s is innovating and changing again to meet the needs of our customers,' Mr Gregory said.

'All of our innovations have been led by Australians. What we’re really doing here is just what our customers have asked us to do.

'An important part of our new learning lab restaurants is that we take customers along the journey with us and get their feedback - we want to make sure Maccas restaurants of the future are what Aussies ordered.'

There will also be table service for customers and home deliveries for 'create your own burgers' customers

Mr Gregory said there will also be a change in the working culture and how staff interact with customers.

Australia's love of McDonald's began when the first fast-food restaurant opened in Yagoona is Sydney's south-west in 1971.

There are about 930 McDonald's restaurants across Australia which serves more than 1.7 million customers a day and employ up to 90,000 people.
