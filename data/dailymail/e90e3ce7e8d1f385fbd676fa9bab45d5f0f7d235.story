Google could place 'flags' on search results to show it has hidden links to embarrassing information following the European Court's controversial 'right to be forgotten' ruling.

Under the plans, an alert would appear at the bottom of a page of search results telling internet users in Europe whether certain links had been deleted.

It comes after the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled that people have a right to
 ask for ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive’ 
material about them to be dropped from search results.

Google is planning to put 'flags' on search results to alert people that links to sensitive information has been removed

The internet giant has since provided forms allowing people to ask that certain information about them be hidden when their name is searched online.

But the company is planning to flag up to European Citizens the occasions when it has removed certain links once a search request has been made, The Sunday Times reports.

Sensitive material would not have to be removed from the internet altogether under the ruling as it would remain on websites such as MailOnline.

But information not shown in internet search
 results is effectively beyond the reach of web users who do not know 
the specific location of what they are looking for.

Earlier this month it was revealed Google had received one demand every seven seconds to suppress information about people’s pasts.

The figures indicate that large amounts of material could disappear from public reach as a direct result of the ECJ decision that search engines must enforce the ‘right to be forgotten’.

Managers at the search engine said the online form was used 12,000 times on the first day its form was available – with applications arriving at the rate of 20 a minute during its busiest periods.

Demands came from all 28 EU countries, but are understood to have involved hundreds from Britain.

Although Google is based in California, judges ruled that it could be considered a European organisation because it maintains sales offices in European countries.

A high proportion of the information expected be lost to European search engine users is likely to be connected to convicted criminals trying to remove records of their past that could be seen by employers, clients or social contacts.

Over the first three days following the court judgement, those asking for records to be removed in Britain included a convicted user of child pornography, a politician with a chequered record in office, and a doctor with a controversial professional record.

The ruling was triggered by a test case involving a Spanish citizen who wanted Google to stop providing an embarrassing link in searches for his name.

The link provided a regional newspaper advert from 1998, in which authorities were auctioning the man’s house to recoup debts to the social security system.

Judges said search engines should be required on request to remove links which breached the ‘right to be forgotten’ – a new rule strongly supported by officials in Brussels but one which has yet to be incorporated into EU treaty law.

The scope of the rule – against which there is no appeal – is not yet clear.

One internet pioneer, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, has already said that the European attempt to suppress information would not work because of the global scale of the web.

He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: ‘They don’t censor the US version. That is not going to happen. There are many search engines around the world which don’t have a presence in Europe and who won’t abide by this ruling.’

Company co-founder Larry Page has suggested authoritarian states around the world will see the controversial ruling as a green light to internet censorship

The BBC, which runs an archive of news stories dating back to the 1990s, is also among organisations to receive requests that material cease to be flagged up.

In his first interview since the decision, company co-founder Larry Page suggested authoritarian states around the world will see the changes as a green light to internet censorship.

'It will be used by other governments that aren't as forward and progressive as Europe to do bad things,' he told the Financial Times.

Google has been contacted for further comment.
