Almost three years ago millions of Americans were marking a supposed new dawn as they celebrated voting in their first black president.

But Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman claims racism in the U.S. has actually got worse since Barack Obama took office in January 2009.

The film star, who played Nelson Mandela in 2009 film Invictus, told CNN the President has become a target for the Tea Party's ‘racist’ aggression.

Not happy: Mr Freeman, who played Nelson Mandela in Invictus, told Piers Morgan the President has become a target for the Tea Party's 'racist' aggression

He backed President Obama during his election campaign and said the Tea Party’s anti-Obama stance is racist, reported the Huffinton Post.

‘Their stated policy, publicly stated, is to do whatever it takes to see to it that Obama only serves one term,’ he told Piers Morgan on CNN.

Is America more racist under Obama?

‘What underlines that? “Screw the country. We're going to do whatever we can to get this black man out of here”.’

Mr Morgan is concerned by the rise of the Tea Party, a right-wing Republican arm that supports presidential candidate Michele Bachmann.

‘It just shows the weak, dark, underside of America,’ he told CNN. ‘We're supposed to be better than that. We really are.

Under-fire: More than 50 per cent of Americans say President Obama, pictured today, is at fault for the dismal state of their economy, a poll revealed this week

‘That's why all those people were in tears when Obama was elected president. "Ah, look at what we are. Look at how this is America."

'Their stated policy, publicly stated, is to do whatever it takes to see to it that Obama only serves one term. What underlines that? “Screw the country. We're going to do whatever we can to get this black man out of here”'

‘And then it just sort of started turning because these people surfaced like stirring up muddy water.’

Mr Morgan said that Americans would be ‘shooting themselves in the head’ if they get rid of President Obama next year after just one term at the White House.

More than 50 per cent of Americans say President Obama is at fault for the dismal state of their economy, a poll revealed on Thursday.

This was a majority for the first time since he took office and will be another concern to a President with an ever-growing list of problems.
