Sky have won a major power battle with BT Sport as the Premier League broadcast rights were sold in a staggering £5.136billion deal - worth over £10m per game.

Sky have swept up the majority of the live slots - winning five of the seven packages that were on offer.

From 2016, Sky will have the Saturday 12.45pm, Sunday 1.30pm, Sunday 4pm, Monday night and new Friday night matches - plus Bank Holiday and other Sunday slots.

This leaves BT Sport with the 5.30pm Saturday slot and occasional midweek matches. 

BT will be delighted to gain greater clout with the new evening slot they have swapped with Sky for their current Saturday lunchtime broadcast, which is considered one of the weaker slots.

And they can also console themselves with the fact they will start their three-year deal to broadcast 350 live Champions League and Europa League games next season.

But it is clear that Sky remain the big player in Premier League TV rights.

The most lucrative sale of club football rights in global football means Premier League clubs will retain their status as the richest in the world collectively. The jaw-dropping revenues mean each game will have cost £10.2m. The total figure is a rise of more than 70 per cent on the £3.018bn collected last time for 2013-16.

The value of overseas rights is also expected to grow as they are sold in regional bundles over the next year. The upshot is that from the 2016-17 season the bottom club in the Premier League can expect around £99m in central prize money each season (up from £62m now) and the highest earning club can expect around £156m (up from £97.5m).

Seven packages were available in the auction, five with 28 games per season and two with 14 games per season.

THE PACKAGES SKY WON 

Package A comprises 28 games on Saturday lunchtimes (12.30pm).

Package C has 28 games kicking off between 1.30pm and 2.15pm on Sundays. Pack A has 6 'first pick' games from 38 rounds and B has 9 first picks.

Package D is the 4pm Sunday bundle of 28 games - crucially with 18 'first pick' games.

Package E is the 'Monday night football' (8pm) bundle, with 18 games on Mondays plus 10 on Fridays; this is the first time Premier League games will be shown live on Friday evenings. There are no first picks in this package.

Package G is a bundle of 14 games on Bank Holidays and other Sunday matches with two first picks.

THE PACKAGES BT SPORT WON 

Package B has 28 games at tea-time on Saturdays (5.30pm)

Packages F has 14 games, a mix of midweek and Saturday games including three first picks.

Under the current ongoing deals Sky have paid £2.28bn over three years from 2013-16 for 116 games per season, or in other words, get 348 games at £6,551,724 each.

BT have paid £738m over three years from 2013-16 for 38 games per season, or in other words, get 114 games at £6,473,684 each.

50 per cent of the revenue is divided equally between the clubs

25 per cent is awarded on a merit basis, determined by final league positions

25 per cent is distributed as a facilities fee for televised matches

Presenters from the two stations were quick to reveal their views on social media, with Gary Neville tweeting: 'I want sensible ticket pricing and grass roots football to benefit as much as possible from this deal. Who doesn't! This is a big issue!

'However the @SkyFootball staff produce / direct and present football better than anyone else. The best won!'

And Jamie Carragher said: 'That's the coaching badges out the window for a few years.

'Great day for @SkyFootball but with the amounts involved ticket pricing especially for away fans has to change. £20 for the 20 away games.'

BT Sport frontman Jake Humphrey added: 'Delighted that @premierleague football remains on @btsport for another 3 years. More games, plus Champs League, FA Cup & European matches.'

The total paid by the two broadcasters is more than the annual BBC budget, according to the Corporations' most recent financial reports.

Total revenue - including the Licence Fee - amounted to £5.066bn in 2013-14, £70m less than the £5.136bn paid by Sky and BT Sport to air 168 football matches. 

Total £5.136bn figure is a rise of more than 70 per cent on the 2013-16 price

BT Sport have swapped their early Saturday slot for the 5.30pm fixtures

'Only Sky Sports will have the best match picks and the best slots so our viewers will be able to follow the biggest matches, the key head to heads and every club at least four times,' Sky Sports Managing Director Barney Francis said. 'No other broadcaster comes close.'

John Petter, BT Consumer CEO said: 'I am pleased we will be showing Premier League football for a further three years and that we have secured the prime Saturday evening slot. 

'These new rights will enhance our existing schedule of football, rugby and other international sport, including all the live footballing action from the UEFA Champions and Europa Leagues starting this summer.

Anticipated bids from the Discovery Channel and beIN Sport did not materialise, meaning consumers should not have to pay additional subscription costs to watch live Premier League football.

Tom Mockridge, chief executive officer of Virgin Media, said: 'A 70 per cent increase shows the TV rights auction is a licence for the Premier League to print money.'

'This is hurting fans and does not warrant an exemption from normal competition law rules.'

Premier League highlights rights remained with the BBC's Match of the Day programme in a £204m deal announced last month - this was an increase of 13.5 per cent on the previous deal of £179m. 

The new deal will start in 2016 with bids from beIN Sports and the Discovery Channel failing to materialise

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said: 'Last season saw record levels of attendance with the highest top-flight crowds since 1949/50, as well as increased viewing figures across all our UK rights holders.

'Both Sky Sports and BT Sport have done a tremendous job in bringing the game to the fans as well as providing the revenue that allows clubs to invest in football, facilities, youth development and their communities.

'It is an endorsement of what the Barclays Premier League delivers that these broadcast partnerships have been extended and enhanced today. We are grateful for the continued belief that Sky Sports and BT Sport have in the Premier League and our clubs, both as a sporting competition and organisations to work with.

'We are also grateful to the significant interest and participation in the process from other highly credible parties.'

Sky Sports is £24.50 extra a month with any Sky TV bundle, or £27.25 on Virgin Media (£7 increase on HD), while BT Sport is free with BT Broadband or £13.50 a month on Sky.

SKY SPORTS

Jeremy Darroch, Sky's Group Chief Executive: 'This is a good result and confirms that Sky is the unrivalled choice for sports fans. We went into the Premier League auction with a clear objective and are pleased to have secured the rights that we wanted.'

Barney Francis, Managing Director of Sky Sports: 'We are looking forward to bringing even more live Premier League football to viewers. Only Sky Sports will have the best match picks and the best slots so our viewers will be able to follow the biggest matches, the key head to heads and every club at least four times. No other broadcaster comes close.

'The best Premier League coverage is part of an unrivalled range of sport across our seven channels and digital platforms. This new deal follows our recent success in the rights market, ensuring Sky Sports will be the first choice for years to come.'

BT SPORT

John Petter, BT Consumer CEO: 'I am pleased we will be showing Premier League football for a further three years and that we have secured the prime Saturday evening slot. These new rights will enhance our existing schedule of football, rugby and other international sport, including all the live footballing action from the UEFA Champions and Europa Leagues starting this summer.

'BT Sport has got off to a strong start, reaching more than five million households and commercial premises, by making itself far more affordable and accessible to sports fans.'
