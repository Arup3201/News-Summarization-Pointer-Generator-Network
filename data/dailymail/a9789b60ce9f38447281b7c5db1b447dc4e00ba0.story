A driver had his brand new Ford Fiesta stolen after a carjacker placed a 'slow' sign in the middle of the road.

The thief pounced early in the morning when Matthew Witts was forced to step out of his car to move the obstruction.

The carjacker ran out of nearby bushes, jumped in the car and hit the accelerator almost running Mr Witts over.

The 21-year-old Post Office worker jumped out of the way and watched helplessly as his £16,000 car sped off into the distance.

Gutted: Matthew Witts was almost run over as he stepped out of his car to remove a 'slow' sign in the road

'Not a scratch on it': Matthew, 21, had only had his red Ford Fiesta for six months before it was stolen in a scam

He said: 'I was in a rush to get to work so I jumped out to move the sign. But I turned around to see this guy jumping into my car.

'He ran from bushes at the side of the road - he would have hit me if I hadn't moved. It was brand new.

'I had only had it for six months so I'm gutted. There was not a scratch on it but now it's probably locked up in a garage waiting to be stripped.' 

The sign was left on a single-lane stretch of road in Kingshurst, West Midlands, at 6.30am on September 20.

Matthew, from Water Orton in Warwickshire, was driving to work from his girlfriend's house. He also lost his wallet, which contained £80 in cash.

Suspicious: The driver was so upset, he appealed for help on Facebook in a post shared more than 2,000 times 

He admitted he was suspicious as he got out of his 2014-registration car.

'When I had the sign in my hand I thought: "Hold on, what's going on here?"

'It was early, there was no-one around and it seemed weird. But it was a Saturday morning so I assumed kids had been messing about the night before and had put something in the road to be a nuisance.'

Matthew was so upset that he appealed on Facebook for help to get his car back. 

He wrote: 'It was a set up, someone left a stop sign in the way of the road and as I stupidly got out to move the sign thinking kids have placed it there. 

'A man then got in attempted to run me over and drove off.'

In a second message, he added: 'Thanks everyone for the support.'

Matthew's red Ford Fiesta Zetec has the registration number BN14 WDM.
