A breathalyser app that can automatically post results to Facebook or Twitter has been launched.

While critics say the BACtrack mobile breathalyser could encourage drinking games, the firm behind it claims it will help users 'understand how alcohol affects their body'.

Users can even create a drink diary of their evening, with pictures of every drink and how it affected their blood alcohol level.

Users can choose from varying levels of privacy - ranging from private, personal and 'fully social'

Users even get to choose from varying levels of privacy - ranging from 'private', 'personal' and 'fully social', which posts results to their linked Twitter and Facebook accounts.

And they can even take pictures of their drinks using the app as well as update their 'drink diary' where they can keep note and describe each drink they have.

The pocket sized device has been designed to accurately track your blood alcohol levels and then plots it in a graph over time.

The
gadget can also track how fast someone is getting drunk and most 
importantly, when their levels will be at an acceptable level to drive a
vehicle.

The firm has even produced a 'drunk map' showing anonymous users complete with their alcohol reading.

Users can even map exactly what they drank and where, creating a drink diary of their evening out, complete with photos 

President of BACtrack Keith Nothacker said: 'We realised that adding smartphone connectivity opens up a wealth of new features for alcohol testing.

'Everything from tracking, analysing, and sharing results, to even making the actual breathalyser smaller because you're using hardware on the phone.

The BACtrack Mobile Breathalyser is truly the most powerful yet personal tool available    for understanding how alcohol affects your body.

The invention costs $150 with over two years of designing and planning went into creating the device.

BACtrack believe their invention will not only encourage responsible drinking but also save lives.

It is currently available on Apple devices but BACtrack are in the process of launching an Android compatible version of the app.

The gadget also changes colour depending on the alcohol level in the user's blood
