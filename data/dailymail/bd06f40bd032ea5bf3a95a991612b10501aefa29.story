Ryan Shawcross has remarkably been pulled off man-marking duties at corners and set-pieces as Stoke City attempt to shield him from the 'grappling' spotlight.

The defender was named as a serial offender of penalty area 'dark arts' by former referee Graham Poll as we launched our 'Hands Off In The Box' campaign.

Ten days ago Shawcross conceded a spot-kick after wrapping his arms around Wilfried Bony in Stoke 2-1 victory over Swansea but in the 1-0 defeat at Southampton on Saturday he was asked to mark zonally.

HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box.

Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating.

And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League.

For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that.

So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees.

We'll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it.

Referee Michael Oliver's decision to penalise the player appears to have had the required deterrent effect. Stoke admit they took action simply because they thought Shawcross's reputation could make him an easy target for other officials even if he did nothing wrong.

Stoke assistant manager Mark Bowen said: 'It seemed as though Ryan was singled out. It was no doubt it was a penalty in the strict sense of the word because of what Ryan was doing.

'But you see it time and again at every game across the country and in Europe as well. Nothing happens.

'On Saturday — and it shouldn't happen like this — we tried to pull him out of the spotlight if you like. So instead of Ryan marking from a corner, we put him in an area where he could attack the ball in a more zonal area.

'That's not his game, he's not been brought up on that. But it comes to something where you've got to try and change your system of marking because you're worried the lad is getting targeted.

'He's our captain, one of our best headers of the ball. You want Ryan Shawcross to be marking their most dangerous player. Even if Ryan doesn't do a full grab but the referee is looking for him, you couldn't leave that to chance. It's at the detriment to us.'

The increasing scourge of man-handling rivals at corners and set-pieces is blighting the game and players know they can get away with it. Chelsea pair John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic, who between them know every trick in the book, were caught by Manchester United's Marcus Rojo and Chris Smalling in the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford.

Terry was so riled that he tweeted a complaint that he and Ivanovic had been 'double headlocked'. Referee Phil Dowd took no action.

In his defence of Shawcross, Bowen then highlighted the other covert crimes committed in the box, as if that was some justification.

Our campaign is to stamp out wrestling, grappling, man-handling, blocking and all the other cheating tactics used by professional footballers.

Former Wales defender Bowen pointed the finger at Swansea pair Bony and Ashley Williams and claimed that they, too, should have been prevented from blocking tactics.

'Is it just holding or is it when people are handing others off?' questioned Bowen. 'We looked at Swansea, they do two blocks on corners. Ashley Williams will stand there and as Wilfried Bony is running past he will turn and block the runner.

'I'm not having a go at Swansea, a lot of teams do it. But is that as cynical as holding? Of course it is. It's foul play but different clubs have different ways of gaining that little advantage.'

Bowen is not the first to admit that coaches regard sneaky fouling in the area as a legitimate tactic. It is impossible for the referee and his assistants to spot who is pushing and it is not unusual to see several players on the ground as the ball flies into the area.

Managers and coaches also know that it is highly unlikely a referee will start to award lots of penalties and/or issue several yellow cards so the offenders get away with it.

Even Bowen did not attempt to deny Shawcross's misdemeanour against Bony. His gripe was that the player had been singled out for punishment on a day when there were others breaking the rules too.

Eagle-eyed Oliver acted while colleague Dowd either missed the fouls or chose to ignore them.

'You wonder if Michael Oliver was seriously looking for something in that area, Phil maybe had a more general picture let's say,' added Bowen.

That inconsistency annoys managers and coaches and also prevents a change of behaviour. Bowen believes that the only way to alter the mindset is by an early avalanche of red cards.

Losing players in games and to suspensions would be the immediate and unpopular result.

Bowen added: 'The only possible way of eradicating it is if every single time it happens it's punished. That might take a significant amount of penalties for all sides throughout the league.

'Then in maybe two months' time or so, you would see a lot more goals because strikers would get first run on defenders.'

No more pushing, but plenty more goals - Sportsmail would settle for that.

John Terry, Chelsea captain

'Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner.'

Colin Pascoe, Liverpool assistant manager

'Grappling. That is the new word is it? It is the referees' interpretation and we'll leave it to them. That's what the referees and the officials are paid for. They make decisions. So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it's in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn't have to mark anyone.' 

Ian Wright, Ex-Arsenal striker

'There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.'

Graham Poll, Former top referee

'Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.'

Martin Keown, Ex-Arsenal defender

'Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.'

Micky Mellon, Shrewsbury Town manager

'In a congested area how can you judge if someone's been blocked? It's part of the game and some people are good at it. It's football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. 'Can you show me some blocking techniques?' That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won't be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.'

And the readers of MailOnline...

'It's more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It's about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.' Willdajack, Neath

'To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop. I've been watching football since the Sixties and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst I've ever seen.' Sir Miles Platting, Manchester
