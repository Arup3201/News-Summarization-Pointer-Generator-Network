Police have launched a murder inquiry into the death of a teenage cyclist who was knocked off his bike by a hit and run driver.

Delaney Brown, 19, died after his bike was hit by a car in Vincent Road, Luton, on Wednesday, police said.

A police spokesman said the death of Delaney Brown was now being treated as murder 'as a result of information which has been given to detectives.'

She refused to be drawn on a motive for the killing but said that a 26-year-old man who had previously been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving had now been freed.

He was released on police bail while further inquiries were carried out.

'We do not want to give out further information while there are still outstanding suspects to be arrested,' the spokesman added.

The 19-year-old was the victim of a hit-and-run driver as he rode his bike along the road. He was thrown to the ground and left to die by the callous motorist who sped off.

Today police appealed for help from the public to convict the killer.

A spokesman for Bedfordshire Police said that the joint major crime team from Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire had launched an investigation into the death.

'Mr Brown, who was from Luton, was pronounced dead at the scene and a full collision investigation was launched.

'Family liaison officers are supporting the victim's family at this time and the coroner will open an inquest in due course.

"Case is now being treated as murder 'as a result of information which has been given to detectives.'" says Police spokesman

'It is believed a silver or grey Astra or BMW, was seen in the area at the time of the collision and officers would urge the driver of this vehicle or anyone who can help trace this car to contact them urgently,' added the spokesman.

Detective Inspector John Arthur added: 'It is clear that there are people who have either witnessed or have a knowledge of this incident. We need their assistance and appeal for them to come forward with their information.'

He said that they could contact the poilice anonymously either via Crimestoppers or by texting the police with their information. 

Detective Inspector John Arthur, from 
the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, 
said: 'It is clear that there are people who have either witnessed this 
incident or who have knowledge of this incident.

'We need their assistance and appeal for them to come forward with any information.

'If people are uncomfortable speaking
directly to the police, for whatever reason, they can contact 
Crimestoppers, completely anonymously.'

Police said that they had arrested a man in relation to the non-stop 
fatal road traffic collision. He said said to be 26 years old and had 
initially been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous 
driving.

Anyone with information is urged to contact Bedfordshire Police on 101 or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
