The family of murdered ­teenager Ben Kinsella told of their fury after the father of one of his killers was handed £20,000 by police.

Michael Alleyne's son, also Michael, stabbed Ben to death in north London in 2008 - but his father has now won a settlement over injuries he suffered during the ­Met Police hunt for the murderer.

Parents George and Debbie Kinsella 
received just half of that when Ben, 16, was killed outside a north London bar in 2008.

Ben, 16 (left), was stabbed to death in a street. Now Michael Alleyne (left) - the father of one of his killers - has received £20,000 compensation from police for injuries and 'trauma' he suffered when they raided his flat

At the time, £10,000 was the most the law allowed for criminal injuries 
compensation.

Mr Alleyne was injured when officers raided his Islington flat while searching for his 18-year-old son on the ­morning after Ben’s death.

He said he was kicked in the eye and had his ankle broken as police handcuffed him to the ground, also claiming he suffered post traumatic stress.

Thug: Michael Alleyne Jr was one of three men jailed for Ben's murder

Police had a warrant for Alleyne Jr’s arrest, but he had already fled. A court was told last year that during the tense raid Mr Alleyne’s pitbull terrier was Tasered and sprayed with a fire extinguisher.

But George and Debbie Kinsella, also from Islington, said today: 'As a family the last four and a half years have been a total nightmare, since losing our Ben in such a horrific, violent and senseless murder. We will always live that nightmare.

'We are devastated by the decision and feel that our system aids and favours perpetrators and their families, not the victims.'

Mr Kinsella told The Sunday Mirror today: 'Officers apparently had no choice but to force entry. They told us they had to Taser the dog and somehow Alleyne Sr got ­trampled.'

Mr Alleyne has now been handed £20,000 in public money as compensation for the injuries and 'trauma'.

Mr Kinsella added: 'Why can’t I sue him for a ­broken heart? I raised a boy who knew respect and morals and now he’s dead. That man raised a ­murderer who ruined our lives. It’s ­devastating.

'It’s left us wondering once again, "Where is the justice?"'

Ben’s sister, former ­EastEnders actress Brooke Kinsella, 29, was also devastated at the news.

She has ­campaigned tirelessly for tougher knife-crime sentences since her brother was killed, working as a Government ambassador and helping to set up the Ben Kinsella Trust.

She tweeted today: 'So unbelievably unfair for our beautiful Ben and for every victim out there. Please help us make change.'

Unfair: Ben's sister, EastEnders actress Brooke Kinsella, today said the decision was a blow for all victims

Star pupil and promising artist Ben was stabbed 11 times in a street after a night out celebrating the end of his GCSEs.

Alleyne Jr is currently serving a life sentence for his killing.

While the Kinsellas do not deny that Mr Alleyne was injured, or even that he should have the right to compensation, they were horrified at the ­discrepancy ­between his payout and theirs, which was spent on Ben’s funeral.

Mrs Kinsella said it was not about the money, but about the principle.

Emily Thornberry, Labour MP for Islington South, said: 'This seems to be a huge insult. No parent could fail to think that this was an insult.'
