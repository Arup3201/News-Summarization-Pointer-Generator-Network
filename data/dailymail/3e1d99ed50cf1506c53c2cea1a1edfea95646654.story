Sergio Aguero may be injured for the entire Premier League Christmas schedule but that hasn't stopped the Manchester City striker joining in with the festivities.

The Argentina international looked in good spirits as he assembled his Christmas tree on Wednesday evening.

Aguero suffered a knee ligament injury during Man City's 1-0 win against Everton earlier this month as is expected to be out for another four weeks, meaning he will miss key games over a busy period.

But the City hitman, who had netted 19 goals before succumbing to injury, took to Instragram to share a picture of himself adjusting decorations to the family's tree.

The striker seemed delighted to be able to bring some Christmas cheer to the Aguero household proudly proclaiming: 'Our christmas tree is here!'.

At a time of year that is all tinsel and lights, Aguero's glittering performances - that have, at times, kept Manchester City in the title race and in Europe - will be sorely missed.
