A hunt member has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm after a protester was left with seven broken ribs and a punctured lung when 'his horse trampled her' at a hunt.

The 42-year-old woman was left seriously injured when she was allegedly hit by the horse at the Blackmore and Sparkford Vale meet in Somerset last Thursday evening.

Police said they are treating the incident as a criminal assault and said the hunt member did not stop after the incident.

The woman suffered seven broken ribs and a suspected punctured lung and was taken to Yeovil District Hospital. 

Hunt saboteurs at the scene claim the alleged incident was caught on video from a camera mounted on a vehicle.

The Hunts Saboteurs Association said the woman was with another protester 'on a public road' when she was hit from behind and dragged along the ground.

The joint master of the hunt, Mike Felton, said members were 'very upset and deeply concerned' that she was injured while the hunt was out.

He said: 'We as a hunt and as individuals deeply regret any accident or incident that happens to anyone who is hurt. There is a police investigation so I can't say much about it.'

The hunt was meeting near its base and kennels at Charlton Horethorne near Wincanton close to the Dorset-Somerset border.

The hunt and its pony club, which consisted of around 60 riders, was met by protesters from the Dorset Hunt Saboteur group.

Saboteurs attend the planned hunts in a bid to raise awareness of animal cruelty and use two main tactics to throw the hunt off course.

One tactic is to cover the scent of a fleeing fox by using citronella (an essential oil) which stops the hounds from knowing which direction the animal has escaped.

The other tactic is to use calls - either voice calls, hunting horns or a  small handheld device with an mp3 player attached - which calls them away from chasing the fox.

Jay Tiernan, spokesman for Stop the Cull, said the incident had come as a ‘massive shock to everyone’.

He said: ‘It’s a massive shock. It’s difficult to see someone who you care for ending up in hospital.

‘By being a saboteur you are in a particularly dangerous environment and there are several people who are injured every year.

‘There is a lot of anger out there, if there isn’t a successful prosecution what will happen to that hunt member?'

Avon and Somerset Police confirmed an investigation had been launched into the incident. 

A  spokesman said: 'We've started an investigation after a woman was significantly injured after being hit by a ridden horse on Water Lane, Charlton Horethorne.

'An investigation began as soon as this incident was reported to us and at this time is being treated as a criminal assault.

'As part of this work we have a copy of some video showing the incident.'

The spokesman added that the man attended a local police station at the weekend and was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm, interviewed and bailed while further enquiries are carried out.
