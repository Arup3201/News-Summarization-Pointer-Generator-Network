Scarlett Johansson's distinctive rising sun tattoo was conspicuously missing when her controversial Soda Stream ad aired during the Super Bowl.

The actress has a multi-colored rising sun tattoo on her inside left forearm, and though it would have only been visible for a quick second of the ad, it was very clearly missing.

It is unknown whether the tattoo was covered up with makeup or airbrushed out after the fact, but there is speculation that the meaning behind that tattoo could have caused problems with Soda Stream executives.

Missing: Scarlett Johansson's inner left forearm is shown during a brief moment of the 30-second Soda Stream ad, but her tattoo is conspicuously missing

Normal: She regularly displays her brightly colored rising sun tattoo on her inner left forearm at events

Though the 28-year-old identifies as Jewish, but goes against the religion's mandate that forbids followers from having tattoos.

Though she turned into somewhat of a lightning rod for controversy with the spot, many praised the selection of Johansson as the Israeli company's first global spokesperson.Â 

It is unclear who mandated that her tattoos were 'erased' from the ad- whether it was Johansson or the company executives- and MailOnline's calls were not immediately returned.

Not only is her colorful rising sun tattoo from her inner left forearm mysteriously missing, but so is the rosary bead bracelet she has on one wrist and the small interlacing circles on her inner ankle.

For much of the 30-second spot, she 
was covered in a bathrobe, in the final moments, she takes off the robe 
to show that she is wearing a form-fitting black dress.

During that reveal, her left arm is is shown and there is no visible tattoo.

Part of her off-screen persona: Scarlett rarely covers up the tattoos when she is not working

Both sides: The rosary tattoo that she has on her right wrist was also gone from the ad

Causing pause: Soda Stream, an Israeli company, was praised for picking a Jewish global ambassador but the faith also prohibits followers from getting tattoos

The same is true of her right wrist, as it is visible when she demonstrates how to use Soda Stream but there is no rosary bracelet visible at the time.

This is not the first time that her tattoos have been removed during an ad campaign, as her tattoos are also conspicuously missing when she posed as a pin-up for a Dolce and Gabbana make up ad.

The motivation behind removing her tattoo is just the latest controversy relating to the multi-million dollar ad, since the company's use of Palestinian factories led to her decision to drop her ambassadorship with Oxfam since the children's charity opposes work in the occupied territory.

Not the first time: Johansson's tattoos have been removed in other ad campaigns as well

Jewish religious doctrine bans tattoos, and though she identifies as Jewish that hasn't stopped her from getting inked

Soda Stream is an Israeli company and picked her as a global ambassador in part because of her religious identity
