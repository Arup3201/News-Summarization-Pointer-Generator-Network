A young graduate died when she was hit by a train after she ran on to the tracks to rescue the dog she was walking.

Yasmin Jones, 22, is thought to have chased after the pet when it wriggled beneath the gates at a level crossing.

The crossing had been branded ‘high risk’ because of a nearby bend in the track which makes approaching trains only visible for a matter of seconds.

The 22-year-old drama graduate killed by a speeding train 'while she tried to rescue a dog' at Fisherman's level crossing in Lancashire on Wednesday has been named as Yasmin Jones (above), from Glastonbury, Somerset

The popular young woman had just graduated from Liverpool John Moores University with a 2:1 drama degree

Yasmin’s father, Nigel Jones, yesterday said she had been trying to chase her boss’s dog when it ran off and she was tragically hit by a train at Freshfield, near Liverpool.

Mr Jones, from Glastonbury, Somerset, said she had just graduated from Liverpool John Moores University with a 2:1 in drama and had decided to stay on Merseyside as she had ‘fallen in love’ with the city. 

She had taken up a part-time job at a local pub and had offered to walk the landlady’s two dogs.

He added: ‘Yasmin had taken the dogs to a nature reserve, where she had been looking for red squirrels. The dog caught sight of another dog on the other side of the line and ran. 

'Without thinking Yasmin followed.’

Yesterday friends paid tribute to Miss Jones. 

Residents close to the incident, which occurred just before 3pm on Wednesday, said Miss Jones had been trying to rescue a dog when she was struck by a passing train. Police said her next of kin had been informed

Sophie Goddard-Jones added: ‘So much love for such an outrageously outstanding human. Keep sharing the love just like she always did.’

University friend Kathryn Schofield added: ‘Still in shock and been thinking of you and your loved ones all day Yasmin Jones our beautiful DIVA!!’

A spokesman for British Transport Police confirmed the death and said the incident was not being treated as suspicious.

Miss Jones' father Nigel described his daughter as 'beautiful' and said the family had been left devastated

The tragedy happened at a crossing, known as Fisherman’s Path, between Freshfield and Ainsdale stations, north of Liverpool, at 3pm on Wednesday. 

Kanesh Saran, who works at a nearby newsagents, said: ‘People say that it’s a dangerous spot. Dogs can get underneath the gate. That’s where the problem started. She has gone through the gate to protect the dog which was on the track and then been hit. It’s very, very sad.’

It is understood that the dog also died. Network Rail graded the crossing as ‘high risk’ in its most recent inspection due to the 146 trains that pass each day and the number of people who use it. 

Miss Jones grew up in Glastonbury but had decided to stay living in Liverpool after graduating earlier this year

In an email from Network Rail to local councillor Nina Killen in April, a spokesman said it planned to close the crossing in the next 18 months.

It added: ‘We have secured funding for a footbridge at Fisherman’s Path and if all goes to plan, it should be installed within the next 18 months.’

Mr Jones said his family had been left devastated. He added: ‘No words can describe the emptiness we feel at this time. We are comforted by the knowledge that her energy and love of life has touched the hearts of so many. 

Miss Jones had graduated from Liverpool's John Moores University and was thought to have been working at a nearby city centre bar called The Caledonia at the time of her death. Friends say she was a 'lovely character'

‘As a family we ask for privacy at this time so that we can try and come to terms with this awful tragedy.’ 

Another, Courtnie Cassidy, who is believed to be a university friend, wrote on Twitter: 'I can't believe it, such sad news.

'You were such a funny, lovely character and made our first year of uni such a laugh so many memories.

'Can't stop thinking of all the memories we shared during first year, you diva.

'Thoughts are with your loved ones. Rip Yasmin never forgotten.' 

Imelda Quinn added: 'Make the most of everyday, how simply life can be taken away

'RIP Yasmin! You truly were a ray of sunshine!' 

And Rebecca Yoxall said: 'Reading the news about Yasmin. Such a tragedy... such a lovely girl gone far too soon #RIP.' 

One group, called GlastonburyBackpackers At TheCrown, also paid tribute to Miss Jones, writing on Facebook: 'Our thoughts go out to Yasmin Jones friends and family today. You were a wonderfully spirited girl and will be sadly missed. Rest in peace sweetness xx'

British Transport Police, Merseyside Police and the North West Ambulance Service were called to the level crossing just before 3pm on Wednesday following reports of the incident. 

Officers, who are still trying to establish the exact circumstances of what happened, said her death is not being treated as suspicious.

Residents near the crossing, which is close to Ainsdale's busy commuter station, said they were aware Miss Jones had been trying to rescue a dog before the tragedy.

 

British Transport Police said the incident was not being treated as suspicious and the woman's next of kin had been informed. Services were severely disrupted in the area following the incident on Wednesday afternoon
