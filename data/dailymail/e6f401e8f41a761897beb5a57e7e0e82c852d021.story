Martin Sculpher said he joined the EDL, pictured clashing with police in Birmingham, after feeling 'let down' by politicians in the wake of the 7/7 attacks

A tube worker who cut the bodies of victims from the mangled wreckage at Edgware Road station in the wake of the 7/7 bombings claims he is 'fighting to protect Britain' after joining the English Defence League.

Martin Sculpher, who was publicly honoured for his bravery, has turned to the far-right group after becoming disillusioned by politicians in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks.

The 52-year-old from east London believes by aligning himself with the group, which stages protests against what it sees as the spread of Islamic extremism, he is fighting to protect the country's future.

He told The Sunday Times he joined because he felt 'let down' by ministers including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who 'pontificated about terror in London' with their 'heads in the clouds' about 'what's going on in this country'.

Mr Sculpher, who met his wife through the EDL, does not feel guilty about being a member of the radical group, dismissing the idea they incite racial hatred blaming the media for its bad reputation.

He said: 'It is not racist to challenge a radical ideology of Islam.'

The father said the group was in its infancy and that it would make mistakes, adding 'I hate the Nazi element as much as I hate radical Islam'.

Prior to his career on the London Underground, Mr Sculpher worked as a bomb disposal apprentice at the Ministry of Defence.

When terrorist bombers Mohammed Sidique 
Khan, Shehzad Tanweer, Hasib Hussain and Germaine Lindsay, struck on 
July 7, 2005, Mr Sculpher was head of the Underground's emergency 
response unit.

Mr Sculpher led a response team at Edgware Road tube station, crawling under the wreckage of the twisted carriage to cut the bodies of victims free from the tunnel

He was alerted to the bomb detonated at Edgware Road station by ringleader Khan, killing six people.

He
 led a response team to the scene and crawled under the mangled wreckage
 of the train to help search for victims and free bodies from the 
twisted carriage.

Richard 
Barnes, who chaired the London Assembly inquiry into the tragedy, 
publicly recognised Mr Sculpher and his colleagues' bravery.

Mr
 Sculpher was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in the wake 
of his experiences, leaving him suffering insomnia, weight loss and 
nausea when he smelt burning meat.

He turned to alcohol and by 2009 was living in a hostel for the homeless in Luton.

The 52-year-old 
has said he will never ride on a London bus again or step foot inside the 
first two carriages of an underground train.

During treatment for his post-traumatic stress disorder, Mr Sculpher said his therapist advised he read the Koran to learn more about the culture.

But he said he was shocked by what he read. He joined the United Peoples of Luton, formed by Tommy Robinson. Staying with the group when it was renamed the English Defence League, Mr Sculper met his wife through it.

He added: 'I want to do something for my children's children.'
