A fantasist who blogged about his experiences as a police officer during last summer’s London riots was today jailed for five years.

Ellis Ward, 29, gained a massive following with his postings about life as a Met police inspector on the streets of London.

As rioters took to the streets last summer, his blogs - which were used by national newspapers - and tweets about attempts to restore law and order enthralled thousands.

Conman: Ellis Ward posed as a police officer on Twitter and gave bogus first-hand accounts of his experiences on the front line during last year's London riots

Writer: Ward was even hired to write a piece for the Daily Telegraph under his police alias - 'Inspector Winter' (stock picture)

Inspector
Winter became the name synonymous with the police social media scene as
he described how he and his ‘team’ were dealing with looters and those 
who had caused mayhem.

He
spoke of 98-hour shifts, fatigue and fear and his never-ending crusade 
to return the streets to decent folk, and at the height of his fame had 
more than 3,000 Twitter followers.

On one celebrated occasion he even told of a dawn raid which dealt with one miscreant looter who was still in bed.

But
Ward’s charade as a police officer was not just restricted to the 
internet, as he also posed as an Army major who had been injured in 
Iraq.

With an impressive 
array of uniforms and identity cards, the serial conman used his aliases
to dupe three unsuspecting women out of thousands of pounds.

At Winchester Crown Court, Ward, of Bishop’s Cleeve, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was jailed for five years after admitting 18 charges of fraud.

Judge Peter Ralls QC told the him: 'You engaged yourself in a deception of quite staggering complexity.

'You lived a complete lie. You were in effect creating a fantasy world for yourself.'

The judge told Ward he had used false identity cards and uniforms to commit a 'serious breach of trust' in defrauding the three women.

'The life you put forward was entirely without foundation,' the judge said.

Ward
was wanted by Gloucestershire Police for fraud in 2009 but was released
from a nine-month prison sentence before officers could speak to him 
and spent the next two and a half years on the run.

He was eventually arrested in February this year as forces including Essex, Wiltshire and Thames Valley helped track him down.

Police found that as well as posing as a police officer, he also claimed to be a major in the Royal Military Police, and while living in Ware, Hertfordshire, he claimed to be a man called Ethan Winchombe.

He told people that he had been invalided out of the Army after being injured in Iraq and had also spent time attached to the Serious Organised Crime Agency.

Flames: The public was eager for information about the riots as they erupted in several English cities last summer (here a shop burns during the disorder in Croydon, south London - stock picture)

Former girlfriends told police that Ward carried false warrant cards, real handcuffs, stop and search forms, witness statement forms and police pocket books.

He also duped The Daily Telegraph 
newspaper, who contacted him to give a first-person account of his 
frontline duties in Tottenham and Croydon during the August riots.

The newspaper paid
him £600 for a column called 'On the frontline.'

Winchester
Crown Court heard Ward befriended one woman over the internet in 
December 2008 and ran up credit card debts in her name of £30,000 over 
the subsequent six months.

He
also later met two other women online - one a serving police
community support officer who later became a PC - and conned them out 
of a total of £12,000.

Prosecutor Michael Williams told the
court: 'The defendant is a professional confidence trickster and over a
number of years has portrayed himself as a senior police officer and an
Army major injured in Iraq to gain the trust of, and defraud, women.

'There was no limit to the lies he was prepared to tell in order to get his hands on money.'

Mr Williams said that when Ward met his first victim in December 2008 'everything he told her was a lie.'

'He told her he had been in the counter terrorism branch and had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder which was triggered by being sent to an address where he discovered his sister’s body,' said Mr Williams.

'He had previously been in the Ministry of Defence Police and while serving a tour of duty in Iraq had been injured by an IED (improvised explosive device).

'She believed it was a genuine relationship, she trusted him and loved him and invited him to share her home.'

Ward was seeing two of the women he defrauded at the same time.

While living with one, he told the other that she could not visit his home as it was on a military base and would compromise his job.

Daniel Higgins, defending, said Ward wished to apologise to all the people he had conned.

'He wishes for me to convey to the court, to those that have been affected, his remorse, whether or not it is accepted or believed,' he said.

'He genuinely liked and loved many of the people involved.'

Mr Higgins said Ward felt excluded from society and did not believe he had an identity as he was without a birth certificate or driving licence.

'Ellis Ward never had a father in his life and his mother was an alcoholic who died in 2004,' he said.

'He told a psychiatrist that he wanted to have a real life, job and friends. In his mind he is somebody that does not exist.

'He has lived a lie and he does accept that he has put a great number of people through heartache.'

Nikki Haywood, district crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service Wessex, said Ward had 'grossly abused the trust and the love of the women he had relationships with.'

She revealed that Ellis had me and started relationships with women before and after his release from prison - telling them 'numerous lies' in order to defraud them by taking out credit cards in their names or loans.

She said Ellis had been driven by 'pure greed' to commit the frauds.
