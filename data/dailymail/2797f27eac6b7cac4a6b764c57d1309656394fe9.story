Europa League broadcasters ITV have pulled off a coup by persuading the injured Everton and England defender Leighton Baines to be part of their panel for tonight's important tie between Roberto Martinez's men and Dynamo Kiev at Goodison Park.

Baines has been ruled out the first leg because of a knock to his quad muscle and will join 1980s Everton legend Peter Reid for the live television coverage to see if his side can salvage some respect for the Premier League after a dismal European campaign for our leading clubs.

Everton may be the only English club who will end up qualifying for the quarter-finals of either European competition. Chelsea crashed out of the Champions League against Paris St Germain on Wednesday while both Arsenal and Manchester City have to overturn first-leg deficits when they travel to Monaco and Barcelona next week.

Roberto Martinez's side are the only English survivors in the Europa League following exits for Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur in the last round and ITV have chosen to show the match from Goodison on their main channel ITV1 rather than ITV4 where most Europa games are screened.

Clive Tyldesley and Andy Townsend will commentate with presenter Mark Pougatch – who recently replaced Adrian Chiles – joined by Baines and Reid.

Baines, 30, rarely does interviews but is known to hold thoughtful and incisive views on football. A huge music fan, he disembarked from the plane that brought back England's players from last summer's World Cup clutching a guitar he had taken with him to South America.

The left-back, who was wanted by Manchester United at the start of last season before he signed a new contract with Everton, has only played once since the end of January because of injury and received a knock to the quad muscle on his leg last month.

He has returned to training though and may make his return in Sunday's Premier League game against Newcastle United.

Everton have so far saved their most impressive performances for Europe and qualified for the knockout stages from a difficult group that included Wolfsburg, Lille and Krasnodar.
