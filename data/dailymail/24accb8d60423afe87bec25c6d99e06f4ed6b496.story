The battle over whether to turn off the life support machine of a 13-year-old girl declared brain dead heads to court Friday after a federal judge ordered the two warring sides to try to reach a settlement.

The US District Court Justice Donna Ryu will convene over a meeting of the family of Jahi McMath and representatives of the hospital where she is being treated in order to get them to reach an agreement over her future.

The teenager suffered complications on December 9 after routine tonsil surgery causing her heart to stop and massive brain damage.

Legal channels: A district court judge is going to mediate a hearing between Jahi McMath's family and her doctors after a continued battle over whether or not her life support can be turned off

Children’s Hospital in Oakland, California, claims the damage is so severe that the child is effectively dead and they want to turn off a respirator keeping her heart pumping.

But the family are adamant she can recover and want her moved to a different medical facility where she can receive long term care.

The war of words, which has divided public opinion, has become so heated that each side is accusing each other of lying and using the tragedy to further their own ends.

Now they have been dragged into Federal Court for a 'mandatory settlement conference' to try to hammer out their differences.

The meeting at 11am will bring to a head three weeks of legal wrangling encompassing three courts and two injunctions – the last of which will run out on Tuesday.

Jahi’s family, citing religious beliefs and the hope that she will pull through, want to continue life support indefinitely.

The hospital wants to remove her from the ventilator that has kept her heart beating, saying the brain death diagnosis means there was no hope of recovery. 

Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo initially ruled that doctors could remove Jahi from the ventilator at 5pm on Monday, but two hours before the deadline gave the family the injunction.

The girl's mother wants to transfer her to another facility and to compel the hospital to allow Jahi to be fitted with the breathing and feeding tubes she would need to be moved safely.

The family of brain dead Jahi McMath is receiving financial help from the Terri Schiavo foundation

The hospital has refused to perform those procedures because they say it is wrong to operate on a dead body.

The legal meeting comes after Jahi's parents received public and financial backing from a foundation started by another family famous for their battle to keep their child on life support.

The Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network has been working with Jahi's relatives to get her moved to a care facility.

The case of Terri Schiavo became famous in the late 1990s and early 2000s when her husband attempted to remove her feeding tube against the wishes of her parents.

Terri Schiavo had suffered a heart attack in 1990 after which her husband cared for her, until 1998 when he filed a petition to have her feeding tube removed.

Michael Schiavo claimed that it was his wife's wish to 'pull the plug', and after several years fighting her family in court, Terri's feeding tube was removed in 2005.

Terri Schiavo's parents set up the foundation in 2001 to fight for Terri's case and now the organisation is devoted to helping families of incapacitated patients facing a loss of life support.

Jahi's mother Nailah Winkfield, believes her daughter can recover and is fighting plans to turn off her ventilator.

On New Years Eve, the family won a last-minute injunction to keep Jahi alive until January 7.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, she said watching her daughter suffering will haunt her forever.

'My daughter started to bleed and that will scar me forever because it happened in front of my face, in front of my mother’s face, in front of my husband’s face,' she said on a break in the grounds of Children’s Hospital, Oakland, California.

'She was very scared. She knew something was wrong. To see your daughter like that is just heartbreaking.

'But I still have hope. In fact I have 
more than hope. I am positive my daughter is going to wake up. I don’t 
have a doubt. I talk to her about it all the time.'

Mrs Winkworth, 34, a Home Depot worker, was comforted by her husband Marvin, 33, a truck driver, as she sat on the wall outside the hospital which she has not left since December 9th when the complications occurred.

'I never knew I would have to fight a hospital to treat my daughter,' she said.

'I find it unbelievable.  I have not been home since December 9th, I have been sleeping in the waiting room. I cannot leave Jahi.'

She said that the way the hospital has treated her daughter and the family has been 'disgusting'.

'The way the hospital has behaved towards me is outrageous. It is disrespectful. It is disgusting.

'They don’t even refer to her by name. They refer to her as the deceased, or the body, or the dead and my daughter is not dead.

'They are awful, they have no compassion.'

Backing: Terri Schaivo was at the center of a right-to-life debate that captivated the United States for several years in the late 90s and early 2000s, and a foundation set up in her name is supporting Jahi's family

Mrs
 Winkfield, who has three other children, said all she wanted to do was 
get her daughter away from the hospital to a place that cared for her.

'The doctors here pretty much want my daughter gone', she said.

'I want the same thing but I want her out of here alive, they want her out of here dead.

'I
 blame the hospital for what happened. They should say ‘hey let’s do 
what’s right for this little girl, we messed her up,  we owe her, the 
least we can do is let her get out of here’.'
