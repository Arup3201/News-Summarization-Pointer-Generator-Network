Mark up: An average large frozen turkey will be £3 more expensive this year at £20

The Christmas turkey will be some 17 per cent more expensive this year as stores attempt to cash in on the festive season.

A typical large frozen turkey, enough to feed more than ten people and leave some over for sandwiches, will be around £3 more expensive at £20.

However, people buying fresh from a butcher will probably be paying at least £60 – and potentially much more -  for a bird of that size.

At the same time other key essentials for the feast, such as potatoes, carrots, peas and, of course, sprouts, are also more expensive.

The latest official figures from Smithfield market suggest the price of turkey is up by some eight per cent in the past year. At the same time, the British Turkey Federation claims a smaller increase of six per cent.

However, a snapshot survey conducted this weekend found a the price of a large frozen turkey in supermarkets was up by some 17 per cent in a year.

Research by The Grocer magazine last year put the price of a frozen turkey weighing 5-6kg at £17, however this year it is around £20,

Tesco is currently charging £20 and Sainsbury’s £22 for a bird weighing 5.3-6.9kg, while Asda is charging £20 for a 5.8kg bird.

The other Christmas dinner essential, Brussel sprouts, are up by some 19per cent this year -  a rise from £2.10 a kilo to some £2.50.

At the same time a 2.5kg pack of white roasting potatoes is up by some 15per cent to £2. The increases for carrots and peas are smaller.

Cashing in: Stores have also upped the prices of brussels sprouts ahead of families doing their Christmas shop

Savings: But shoppers will be able to find cut-price deals on mince pies and satsumas in certain supermarkets

Smoked salmon and stilton are now as much a part of Christmas as the turkey. The survey found that Blue Stilton is up by around 5 per cent to £2.32 for just 100g, while smoked salmon is up by some 28 per cent to £4 for a 100g pack.

However, there is some positive news from the survey, which found some significant price reductions this year, particularly on drink.

A bottle of Hardys Stamp Shiraz is down from £5.92 to £5; four cans of Stella are down from £4.06 to £3.50, Harveys Bristol Cream from £8.30 to £8 and Baileys from £12.17 to £12.

There are also savings on coffee, Satsumas, a tin of Cadbury’s Roses and a pack of mince pies.

Paul Kelly, chairman of the British Turkey Federation, said: ‘Massive fluctuations in the price of feed affects the price of a turkey but people will still 'trade up' at Christmas by getting the best they can afford. This year you'll be paying around £53 for a 4kg turkey.’

Iceland claims to offer the cheapest Christmas dinner at a total of £30.50 for a meal for eight. This includes a self-basting Golden Norfolk Turkey, weight - 4.05-5.4kg – at £14.

Also on its frozen food menu is a 907g pack of oven ready roast potatoes, and a 900g pack of button sprouts, which come in at £1 each. Its pack of six deep filled mince pies are also £1.

Chief executive, Malcolm Walker, said: ‘We’ve worked extra hard this year to be sure that our products offer a better price, or superior quality at a matching price, against what you’ll find at the ‘Big 4’ supermarkets.’
