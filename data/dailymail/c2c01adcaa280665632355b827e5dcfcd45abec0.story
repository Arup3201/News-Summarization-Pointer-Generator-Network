Relaxed: Lord Hanningfield outside his home earlier this week before being rearrested

Expenses cheat Lord Hanningfield was arrested yesterday – just days after being released from jail.

The former Tory peer, who was imprisoned for falsely claiming more than £13,000, was questioned over allegations that he had also put in fraudulent claims while leader of Essex County Council.

The politician, who was born  Paul White, has been released on bail until January 18 ‘pending further inquiries’.

A spokesman for Essex police said: ‘A 70-year-old man from the Chelmsford area has been arrested... for fraud as part of an investigation into expenses claims.’

Lord Hanningfield, a former pig farmer, was freed from prison last week after serving just a quarter of his nine-month sentence.

He was a former frontbench opposition spokesperson and leader of Essex County Council and was jailed in July this year after a jury at Chelmsford crown court found him guilty of £13,379-worth of expenses fraud.

He claimed parliamentary travel expenses to London when Essex county council was already paying for him to be chaffeur-driven to the capital.

He was found guilty of six counts of false accounting which included falsely claiming for overnight hotel accommodation when he was actually sleeping at his home 50 miles away.

Justice Saunders branded the lord a 'benefits cheat' when he sentenced him. Hanningfield then lost an appeal against his conviction in July when judges said his case was 'unarguable'.

But he was freed earlier this week after serving only nine weeks of a nine month sentence.

The former peer was pictured earlier this week walking his dog in his home village of 
West Hanningfield, Essex. He looked relaxed and refused to admit any wrongdoing.

‘I have been out of prison for a few days and I was treated very well,’ he said.

‘There is much more to my side of the story, which will be revealed when I’m ready.’

‘I just want a couple of weeks to myself to relax and let everything settle down’.

Lord Taylor of Warwick, who was jailed in May for 12 months after fiddling £11,000 of taxpayers' money, is also out on early release.

Taylor celebrated his freedom by visiting his local beauty salon for an hour in Ealing, west London.

It is not known what treatment the peer enjoyed, but massage and holistic therapies are its specialty.

Both men were expelled from the Conservative party but they remain members of the House of Lords – enabling them to start claiming more expenses.

It is understood they were released separately last week on a home detention curfew which deems them low risk and forces them to wear an electronic tag.
