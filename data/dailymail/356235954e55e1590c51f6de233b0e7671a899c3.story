The world has gone well and truly pear-shaped - if these pictures are anything to go by.

A Russian artist has taken the unremarkable fruit and used it for a new photography series in which pears are pictured in crazy and often realistic scenes.

Stanislav Aristov constructs the backdrops before placing the fruit in romantic, surreal, funny or just bizarre situations.

Loved up pear: The fruit are pictured in a wedding scene complete with veil, corsage and wedding bands

Forgotten fruit: This pear is bathed in the light from a window and appears to be in a dark cell

The 30-year-old from Yekaterinburg, Russia, uses his dark sense of humour to bring the mundane fruit to life.

He spends hours selecting the right pear for his pieces before building a background and photographing his unusual subjects.

Among the series are images of pears dressed as punks or buskers, romantic couples or even young children.

In one, a conspicuous-looking pear is seen lurking suspiciously by a comedy wanted poster.

Clever pear: The fruit wears glasses as it reads through the oversized book

Disguise: A pear loiters suspiciously in sunglasses and a cap next to a wanted poster in a dark alley

Pear-fect: The well-placed pears cast a shadow in the shape of a heart

Aristov uses over-ripened fruit to portray the elderly in the pictures.

In one image, a wizened fruit is pictured staring longingly at a more youthful image of itself and in another a wrinkled pear begging on the street goes unnoticed as other pears rush by.

The artist also plays on the shape of the fruit.

He morphs it into lightbulbs, uses them to cast interesting shadows and in one picture has a cube-shaped pear.

Spooky: The artist uses his dark sense of humour to bring the mundane fruit to life

Stanislav, an IT specialist, said his aim was to try and make the curious creations as realistic as possible.

Stanislav, who has also gained praise for a separate photography series using burned matches, wanted to make the pears look like as much like people as possible.

He said: 'The idea is to present a human-like pear and make it look as genuine as I can.

'The hardest and most time consuming 
thing though is finding the model - the correct pear for the shoot. That
can be quite tricky.'

He said another time-consuming aspect of the project is to build the sets.

But he said the hard work has been worth the effort after the project was praised.

He said: 'The scenery and backgrounds also take quite a lot of time to design and build.

'People generally seem to like my work. They tell me that they find the pieces interesting and very realistic.'

Musical pears: A fruit busker plays the violin in a subway - but it does not seem to have made any money
