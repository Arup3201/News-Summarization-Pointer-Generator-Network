Fisherman Ivor Charles cuts the engine of his sailing boat on a gently swelling sea beyond Weymouth Harbour, so all we can hear is the sound of the waves. 

‘Listen!’ he whispers. ‘Hear that gurgling sound? That’s the boat singing to us.’

And so it seems. There is no lullaby as gentle as the quiet lapping of water against the sides of a small boat. Ivor, 75, runs up the main sail. The breeze tugs at it. It bellies out and we’re off, gliding on a current of air.

Seadog: Fisherman Ivor Charles has become the go-to man for Hollywood film scouts hoping to give authenticity to nautical scenes by including sea-faring men

He reels in his fishing lines. All along them, like jewels on a necklace, hang a shoal of mackerel, silver and iridescent green.

Below in the cabin, Ivor’s mate David Parrott, 63, brews coffee. We warm our hands on mugs of it. Above us, in a cold, bright sky, an early winter sun shines. ‘Pure Heaven,’ declares Ivor. And that’s just how it seems.

Ivor fell in love with the sea 65 years ago; now it runs in his blood, a briny tide. And if you were to ask anyone, the world over, to describe an old sea dog, they’d paint a verbal picture of him: a face craggy and weathered by salt and sea air; snowy hair and a white beard; twinkling eyes as blue as a summer tide.

Which is why, when Hollywood film scouts
 are looking for sea-faring men — sailors, fishermen, sea captains, 
pirates — to give authenticity to nautical scenes, Ivor is their go-to 
man. And why, late in life, he has a burgeoning career as an extra in 
big-screen movies.

Hollywood calls: Ivor spruced up as the captain of the Titanic for a TV documentary during his burgeoning career as an extra in big-screen movies and TV programmes

Ivor has worked alongside a veritable galaxy of A-list stars. His credits include Dark Shadows, Tim Burton’s 2012 gothic comedy starring Eva Green, Michelle Pfeiffer and Johnny Depp, who plays a 200-year-old vampire.

Ivor portrayed a fisherman in the film as he also did in Snow White And The Huntsman, a 2012 fantasy based on the Grimm’s fairy tale and starring Charlize Theron, Kristen Stewart, Chris Hemsworth and Bob Hoskins.

Spruce and neatly barbered, he was 
elevated to Captain Smith of the Titanic in a 2012 National Geographic 
documentary film Titanic: Case Closed. He even had a line (‘Carry on, 
Murdoch’) to deliver to the doomed ship’s First Officer.

He
 appears, too, in Da Vinci’s Demons, a British/American collaboration 
for TV in which he brings realism to a dockside scene as a beggar. 

And
 his most recent call was to Pinewood Studios, where he will play a 
fisherman in Disney’s remake of Cinderella, directed by Kenneth Branagh,
 with Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother and Lily James, of 
Downton Abbey, as Cinders.

But
 how it all came to be is a story in itself. For decades, Ivor — 
long-since divorced with three daughters and 11 grandchildren — has 
garnered a reputation as a local celebrity on the picturesque quayside 
of Weymouth, Dorset. You’ll find him there most days on his boat, 
Humdinger.

A lithe man, 
upright as a ship’s mast, in navy blue Guernsey and reefer jacket, he 
sits among barnacled lobster pots, smoking a roll-up.

Sightseers
 are drawn to him. Many ask to photograph him and he is always happy to 
say ‘yes’ as long as they donate £1 to the RNLI. Indeed, one recent 
summer’s day, he reckons he raised about £85 for the lifeboats.

But he made the leap into films by 
accident, when five years ago production workers on Richard Curtis’s 
film The Boat That Rocked — set in 1966, it features a fictitious pirate
 radio station — arrived in Weymouth to recruit extras for a sea rescue 
scene.

Ivor was walking 
along the seafront to his boat when he saw the queue of hopefuls waiting
 to audition outside a hotel. He bumped into a friend who told him the 
extras were wanted for background shots and needed to ‘blend in’. 

‘I told him: “I’d be no good for that. I stick out like a sore thumb.” ’

But
 as he stood having a smoke and chatting, he was approached by a man 
with a clipboard who encouraged him to apply. ‘So I thought: “Why not?” 
And that’s how I got the job.’

He beams a toothless smile. There are 
only two teeth in Ivor’s head. ‘I did have three, but I pulled one out 
with a pair of long-nosed pliers only last week. It was giving me gyp.’

Ivor
 took to filming like a boat to water: he featured in the Richard Curtis
 film as one of the crew of a fishing boat that goes to the rescue of 
the pirate radio DJs in a storm.

‘One of my grandsons told me: “Grandad, I saw you in the film — for all of five seconds!” ’ He chuckles.

It might have ended there, were it not for Ivor’s friend Svetlana Savrasova, a keen amateur photographer, who persuaded him to enrol with Mad Dog Casting, an agency specialising in extras with character. Thereafter, the work rolled in.

‘I never need make-up,’ says Ivor, 
proudly. Indeed, his sea-blown characteristics are so perfect, one 
make-up lady refused to trim his beard after he asked her to.

She told him: ‘My notes say: “Don’t touch his beard. Don’t touch his hair. Don’t touch a thing.” ’

Ivor’s
 interpretation is: ‘They’re too polite to say it, but I’m scruffy and 
that’s exactly the look they want. But I’ve lived with this face for 75 
years. I wouldn’t change it now.’

Indeed,
 the casting agents were so impressed with Ivor that they asked Sevtlana
 if she knew any more Weymouth fishermen who might also want to become 
film extras.

After placing 
an advert in the bistro where they go for breakfast, lots of men came 
forward. The agency recruited 12 — Ivor’s friend Dave Parrott among them
 — and they were asked to grow Ivor-style beards. ‘So any fisherman you 
see hereabouts with a beard has most likely been in a film,’ says Ivor.

Beginning of his movie career: Ivor got his first extras job working on Richard Curtis's film The Boat That Rocked after the film crew arrived in Weymouth to recruit extras for a sea rescue scene

They hired a minibus to go to Pinewood Studios  to film Dark Shadows and later, Snow White And The Huntsman. Ivor’s friend Kevin Nurrish, 60, who appeared in both films, remembers the fanfare when they turned up on the set, a replica of a harbour town in New England.

He says: ‘Someone shouted: “Everyone stop! The Dorset Fishermen have arrived! They’ll show you exactly what happens on a boat!”

‘They’d even imported American seagulls which had to be looked after by a specially employed seagull wrangler.’

The high-point for Kevin was sitting during a pub scene next to veteran actor Christopher Lee.

‘Johnny Depp was there, too, filming until 2am. He chatted with us and was lovely to everyone,’ says Kevin.

They even shared a pint with film producer Richard D. Zanuck who was responsible for such hits as Jaws and Driving Miss Daisy (Dark Shadows was his penultimate film before his death last year).

A photo of them all is displayed in Ivor’s local, The King’s Arms, on the harbourside. ‘See that knife stuck in the table?’ Ivor says, pointing to a lethal looking blade in the photo. ‘That’s my best filleting knife.’

Out on the sea, sailing past oil tankers, fishing boats and the Condor cross-channel ferry, Ivor is most at home. He and David, friends for almost 50 years, share reminiscences about their filming exploits.

David remembers: ‘During filming of Snow White And The Huntsman, the producer told Ivor to say to me “That’s the huntsman” every time one actor rode by. The third time he said it, I said: “Yes Ivor. You’ve already told me twice. I know it’s the blooming huntsman!” Ivor said: “You silly b****r, I’ve been told to say that!” ’ 

Then there was the occasion their friend, fisherman Peter Matthews, newly recovering from a cataract op, was called on to man a fish stall on the set of Snow White. ‘And he was blinking and grimacing because of the eye op,’ says Ivor, ‘and they says to him: “Yes, that’s brilliant. Wink at the lady customers just like that!” ’

The little boat is rocking with their laughter. 

Ivor and David are a double act, united by their love of the sea. Every weekend, David deserts his wife Penny to go sea fishing with his friend. ‘My wife spends a lot more on her pleasures than I do, but I enjoy myself more,’ he says. ‘Come Friday, I’m still smiling from the weekend before.’ 

Ivor concurs: ‘I’m never happier than when I’m out on the water. And filming’s a good life, too. We just mess around with nets and fish like we would do anyway.’

I wonder what characters Ivor would like to play next. 

‘I could be the new Captain Birdseye,’ he says, ‘only a slimmer, trimmer version. And if Johnny Depp makes another Pirates Of The Caribbean, I’d love to be in that.

‘In fact,’ he smiles, ‘they need look no further than Weymouth for the whole cast. The Dorset Fishermen could supply a complete crew.’
