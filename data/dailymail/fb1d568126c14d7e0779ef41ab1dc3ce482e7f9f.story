Manchester United striker Robin van Persie admitted the win over Southampton on Monday night reminded him of when Sir Alex Ferguson was in charge.

Van Persie scored two goals as United moved to third in the Barclays Premier League by beating pretenders Southampton 2-1 at St Mary's.

The Dutchman felt like he was back in the Sir Alex era as he celebrated winning the game for Louis van Gaal in front of the travelling fans.

'They (the supporters) were unbelievable. I just want to say that it felt like the old days, like two years ago. It was a really special day, and they were unbelievable,' Van Persie told MUTV.

'I want to thank them because I know they've been travelling from all over England, maybe some from abroad. 

'It's a long journey. Thanks everyone for coming. You are absolutely amazing.'

United are now firmly on track to qualify for the Champions League after a rocky start to life in Manchester for former Holland manager Van Gaal. 

They have won five consecutive Premier League games and Van Persie hopes for more of the same atmosphere when United face Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday.

'My first away game against Southampton for United two and a half years ago was a special one, but I think today was a good one as well,' added the 31-year-old.
