The Yorkshire Ripper is enjoying a cushy lifestyle in Broadmoor eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, it was claimed yesterday.

Despite being one of the country’s most notorious serial killers, Peter Sutcliffe, 68, is allowed visitors four days a week who can stay for up to four hours.

He is said to have money to spend in the psychiatric hospital’s shop, and attends a ceramics workshop and twice-weekly Bible studies sessions. It has been claimed that Sutcliffe is now a Jehovah’s Witness.

Relaxed: Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe (pictured above) is said to enjoy a relaxed life in Broadmoor with an MP3 player, an X Factor habit, four-hour visits and money from penpals to spend in the hospital's own shop

Sutcliffe, who killed 13 women and tried to murder seven others between 1975 and 1980, has been held at Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire (pictured) for more than 30 years. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia

In the evenings, he watches TV shows such as The X Factor and I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, the Sun on Sunday reported. 

The mass murderer – who savagely killed 13 women – also has his own MP3 player and can read emails.

A new image of a relaxed-looking Sutcliffe – the first for 20 years – supports the easy lifestyle claim. There has been little change to his distinctive appearance apart from an increase in weight and the greying of his hair and beard.

Sutcliffe has certainly piled on the pounds. One report estimated his weight at 19 or 20 stone. He has type 2 diabetes, but rather than hit the gym to get fit he is said to enjoy chocolate and burgers.

Sutcliffe has been in Broadmoor for more than three decades after he was given 20 life sentences in 1981. As well as the 13 women he killed, he tried to murder seven more in a five-year spree.

The claims about his lifestyle have angered victims’ families. Roofer Neil Jackson, 56, whose mother Emily was Sutcliffe’s second victim, said: ‘He tore apart our family and this just looks like he’s being rewarded. He’s getting an easy life and he’s clearly enjoying every minute. I hope the lifestyle kills him.

‘It doesn’t matter how many years go by, it doesn’t make the pain of what he did any easier.’  

Lifestyle: The high-security hospital houses more than 200 patients, many with severe psychiatric disorders

Corridors: Inside Broadmoor looks like any other hospital, but patients like Sutcliffe are closely monitored

Connections: This photo showed the moment Sutcliffe was introduced to Frank Bruno by disgraced entertainer Jimmy Savile in 1991. Boxer Mr Bruno said he was duped and did not know who he was meeting

Attack: Sutcliffe after he was first assaulted by another inmate in 1983. Several other attacks would follow

Greg Mulholland, a Liberal Democrat MP in Leeds where Sutcliffe attacked a number of women, said: ‘Every time there are reports of Peter Sutcliffe’s life it is hugely distressing to the relatives of his many victims. 

'Considering the enormity of his despicable crimes people need to have confidence that his life behind bars is not a soft touch.’ 

Although Sutcliffe has gone grey, the new photo reveals that he still has his full head of frizzy hair, beard and moustache, familiar dark staring eyes and arrogant smirk.

Change: Sutcliffe's apparent weight gain is a far cry from photos which circulated of him in the 1980s

He is smartly dressed in a pink shirt and patterned red tie.

The picture is said to have been taken in a playroom normally used for the children of people visiting the high-security institution in Berkshire. 

Sutcliffe posed for it with an unidentified visitor and was watched closely by guards in the room. When shown the photo he is said to have commented: ‘Oh God, I look so old.’

It costs taxpayers more than £300,000 a year to detain him in Broadmoor, at least five times the cost of a prison cell.

Last year his plea to be moved to a unit in his home county of West Yorkshire was rejected.

In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released.

His health has deteriorated in recent years. He had a hernia operation in 2013 and later suffered from a debilitating cough. 

Medication has made him put on weight and has increased his blood pressure. 

Two months ago he suffered an attack of angina.

He has reportedly been banned from eating fried breakfasts and must have cereal instead.

Sutcliffe used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England. 

He believed he was on a ‘mission from God’ to kill sex workers.
