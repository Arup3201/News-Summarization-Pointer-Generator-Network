Texas bound? After saying farewell to Fox Glenn Beck is thought to be moving to a rented mansion in Dallas, Texas

After saying farewell to Fox, Glenn Beck is going it alone.

So what better place to head than the Lone Star state of Texas?

The right-wing mouth piece, who is thought to have sold his Connecticut home for $3.6million, is moving his family to Dallas, according to his listing agent.

'They are going to the Dallas area,' Lynne Leonard told the New York Daily News. 'They will be renting. It's secure and gated.'

Beck is expected to move into the seven-bedroom pile owned by baseball player Jorge Piedra and Swarovski heiress Vanessa Piedra.

The home is currently on the market for $3.9million, but Beck will be renting the 7,900-square foot mansion for $20,000-a-month for the time being, Dallas-based real estate blogger Candy Evans said.

As well as multiple bedrooms Beck can also look forward to seven-and-a-half bathrooms, two-acres of land and of course, Swarovski crystals throughout the house.

He is thought to still own an apartment in Manhattan however and his production company, Mercury Radio Arts will still operate out of New York meaning he could be back in the city repeatedly.

But on a prior show he's also joked with Texas Governor Rick Perry that he would run for the post.

Beck drew his final breath, on television at least, last night.

The now ex Fox News host filed his last ever show with a series of bizarre rants that repeatedly returned to the reason why he had decided to call time on the programme after two-and-a-half years.

He promised a so-called cynical media 
that he would be back adding 'you will pray for the time when I was only
on the air for one hour a day.'

Beck went on to reveal his plans in a live Q and A after the show online.

Eat in, work out: The house also comes with a home gym and lavish kitchen. Should Beck fancy a stroll to mull on his various philosophies he can do so within the sprawling grounds

From September Beck will broadcast a two-hour daily show on his GBTV internet network.

He is also launching a charity programme called Mercury One, the name of which he revealed during his live TV show.

Mercury One will be a 'humanitarian' project that will gather people to help others in disasters and tragedies, Beck explained.

Legacy: Beck said he and his audience must have 'faith, hope and charity' going forward

'It will be part of a rapid response team everywhere in America, in every town...everywhere,' he added.

He is even planning a clothing line called 1791, the same date the U.S. Bill of Rights was ratified.

'It's not about GBTV, it's about 
saving the world,' Beck said before setting out a challenge for people 
to sign up as 'peace ambassadors.'

'It's 828,
it's' Restoring Courage.'

During his hour-long last show, Beck said he was heading to Israel in search of 'courage.'

'What makes 
people live in Israel? he asked. 'It 's a ticking time bomb. How do I get some of 
that courage? I begin my search after this programme.'

The infamous chalk boards: CNN may have graphics, but Fox has chalkboards, Beck told his audience

The show, broadcast live, kicked off with Beck reliving the last two-and-a-half years with a montage of best bits.

Before that he had taken the cameras back stage to see where the props for the show were kept or 'magnet alley' as he called it.

Floor to ceiling shelves groaned 
under the weight of aids the Fox host had used over the years to express
certain metaphors. Quiet what a chainsaw was doing there was anyone's 
guess.

There was also cases and cases of chalk for writing on the infamous chalkboards of the show.

Beck later joked that 'CNN use graphics, we use chalkboards,' adding that he always felt as though he had chalk on his trousers.

There was some speculation Beck may cry. He didn't but there were many emotional moments - genuine and hammed.

'I've met amazing friends' on this show, he said. 'Namely you.'

Beck then went on to talk about all the 'amazing' things the Glen Beck Show has taught the people of America.

Looking back: Beck admitted he'd done many things in order to 'hack the left off' as he went over his best bits

Should the topics have slipped anyone's memory, they were all handily written up on a chalkboard titled: 'Things we've learned.'

'How many people knew about the great depression of 1920' before the show? Asked Beck.

'We showed you.'

'We are the same, me and you,' he continued before adding: 'I may be able to figure out some things little faster than you.'

He's
well known for going on a bit but in tonight's show Beck actually 
celebrated his 'staggeringly long monologues' saying that a 21 minute 
stint was normal for the show now.

He even took on Jon Stewart, berating him for having 'so many writers' for 'just six minutes' worth of material.

End of an era: The blinds go up and the set is dismantled as Beck says a final farewell to his audience

He then brought in his show's writers, all two of them. They shuffled about and looked at the floor for a bit before the show went to a commercial break.

Beck, teasing the audience, kept suggesting he would reveal the real reason why he was leaving 'next,' but never quite made it.

'There were people who said I was fired,' Beck said in a booming voice before going on to suggest if he had been sacked he wouldn't be in the midst of a live broadcast.

Many asked if he was negotiating his contract Beck added, even his agent.

But in the end Beck said he was standing in his New York City apartment looking at the skyline after 'hanging out with Bono' backstage after watching Spiderman: Turn off the Dark musical, currently on Broadway, and thought: 'If you don't leave now, you will not leave with your soul.

'Never want anything too much,' he said. 'It will destroy you.'

Beck ended the show saying he was 'determined to fix this country one family, one entrepreneur at a time,' with his new project 'Mercury one.'

He failed to say what that was exactly, but left the audience in no doubt that he'd be back soon.Â
