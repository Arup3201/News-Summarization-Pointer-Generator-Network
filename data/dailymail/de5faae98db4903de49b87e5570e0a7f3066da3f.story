Friends and family of a much loved grandmother beheaded outside her London home gathered together today to mark her funeral.

Palmira Silva, 82, died after she was allegedly attacked with a machete by Nicholas Salvadore, 25, in the garden of her home in Edmonton, north London earlier this month.

Today her loved ones said their final goodbyes to the Italian-born mother-of-two, gathering outside one of the London cafes that she ran with her family.

Other local traders and shoppers lined the street outside Silva's Cafe in Edmonton, many of them bearing bouquets of flowers as the hearse carrying Mrs Silva's body drove slowly past.

Around 150 people turned out to see the funeral cortege pause at the cafe before it went on to a nearby church.

Her coffin was accompanied on one side by a pink floral arrangement spelling 'Mum', and on the other the arrangement read 'Nonna' - the Italian for grandmother.

A vibrant bouquet of sunflowers and roses had been placed atop the coffin, as mourners stopped next to the cafe to pay their respects.

For others, the sombre occasion became too much, and many shed tears, or embraced one another in grief. 

Mrs Silva, who was known as Pam, and her husband Domenico moved to separately to London from their native Italy in the 1950s to start a new life. 

Emotion:Friends and family members were joined by neighbours and local traders as they gathered to say goodbye to Mrs Silva at today's funeral

Sorrow: Mourners, many of them bearing bouquets of flowers gather as the funeral cortege travels past

The couple ran a restaurant business together and had two children, a daughter, Celestina, and a son, Rino.

Mr Silva died in 2008 but in Edmonton, the family continued the business with Silva’s Cafe building up a solid base of regular customers who enjoyed Mrs Silva’s friendliness as much as her food. 

She had only recently stopped working full time at the cafe, a few minutes walk from her home, having handed over the running to Rino, now 53, after her husband died.

Much loved: Mrs Silva had only returned from a family holiday in Italy in the week before she died

Mr Silva died in 2008 but in Edmonton, the family continued the business with Silva’s Cafe building up a solid base of regular customers who enjoyed Mrs Silva’s friendliness as much as her food. 

She had only recently stopped working full time at the cafe, a few minutes walk from her home, having handed over the running to Rino, now 53, after her husband died.

Mrs Silva had only returned from a family holiday in Italy in the week before her death.

Friends today recalled the woman who had no enemies.

John Morris, 64, a retired carpenter, lived in the flat above the cafe for up to eight months four years ago.

He said: 'I didn’t believe it when I heard it. I thought it might be someone of the same name. I couldn’t sleep for two nights about it. She was a beautiful person.

'I can’t think she’d had a holiday in 30 years, she lived for the cafe. She was very hard-working.

'She had time for everyone, I think she thought there was no such thing as an enemy.'

Roger Turley, 72, a retired businessman, said: 'She cooked my meals for 20 years. Rino, her son, rang me and he could hardly speak. He said ‘My mother’s had her head cut off’ - what can you say to that?

'She could run that cafe on her own - didn’t take notes, took the orders, remembered what people wanted, how they liked it cooked, and who they all were.

'She was a remarkable woman. This is a very sad day.'

Brenda Eberson, 73, said: 'I knew her well, she was a really beautiful lady. When my husband Peter and I would go past, she’d say "Would you like to come in and have a cup of tea?"

'I’m so sad, I couldn’t sleep when I was told.' 

Speaking after her death, Celestina said: ‘It’s just the most horrendous thing to do to another human being. We simply can’t make any sense of it.’ 

Scene: Police investigate the scene where Mrs Silva was found dead earlier this month

Mrs Silva was found dead at her home on September 4, and the cafe became a focus for tributes, with hundreds leaving messages of condolences and flowers.

The house in the busy street where the Italian widow's body was found was the scene of a major police operation after officers were called to the scene initially to reports that a man had beheaded an animal.

Scotland Yard said that its officers distracted the man after he was seen going through back gardens in Nightingale Road to prevent him attacking anyone else, while they evacuated people from nearby homes.

Unemployed Salvadore, of Enfield, north London, was staying with a friend a few doors from the Italian widow at the time of her death.

He is charged with murdering Mrs Silva and assaulting a police officer, PC Bernie Hamilton. He has not yet entered pleas to either of the charges.
