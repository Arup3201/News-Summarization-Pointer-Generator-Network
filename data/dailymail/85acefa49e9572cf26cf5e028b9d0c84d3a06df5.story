Ferrari have ended speculation surrounding Fernando Alonso's future - with their outgoing president confirming he will cut short the Spaniard's contract at the end of the season.

Alonso was widely rumoured to be leaving the team he has been part of since 2010, but Luca Di Montezemolo finally provided confirmation that he would be heading for the exit on Italian television.

'Fernando is leaving for two reasons,' Di Montezemolo said. 'One, he wants another environment. Two, because he is an age when he cannot wait to win again.'

Alonso is said to have lost faith in Ferrari's ability to produce a winning car as he currently sits sixth in the drivers' championship with three races remaining.

'He was disappointed that he has not won over these last years and wanted new stimulus,' Di Montezemolo confirmed.

Alonso gave a hint about his Formula One future at Sunday's Russian Grand Prix by saying the decision would seem obvious once announced and he was unlikely to drive for a Mercedes-powered team.

'I'm not in a hurry...I understand the curiosity, and I understand, for the fans, the news that can be around the future,' the Spaniard told reporters.

'But do not worry, do not worry. Just relax, enjoy, and when it's time to know it, you will know it. 

Alonso has been at Ferrari since 2010, but has never won a Championship with the Italian team

'My mind is set, for the last two or three months, and when you know you will understand that probably it was very obvious what I would do,' added the double world champion.

In a separate interview with NBC television, Alonso said 'I don't think so' when asked if he would be driving for a team with Mercedes engines.

That would appear to leave only a return to McLaren, who are starting a new partnership with Honda, or staying at Ferrari as the 33-year-old's realistic options of a drive given that Renault-powered Red Bull have announced a 2015 line-up.

Although Alonso has a contract at Ferrari until the end of 2016, he is expected to leave at the end of the year to make way for four-times champion Sebastian Vettel.

Kimi Raikkonen, Ferrari's 2007 champion, has a contract for 2015 but has been eclipsed by Alonso this year.

Vettel announced last week that he was leaving Red Bull at the end of the year, with his team's principal Christian Horner saying the driver was heading for Ferrari. Neither Ferrari nor the German have confirmed anything.

Maintaining the intrigue, Alonso also said he wanted to do his best for the future of Ferrari.

'My decision...was to help this fantastic team, and I'm extremely happy with the things that will come,' he said.
