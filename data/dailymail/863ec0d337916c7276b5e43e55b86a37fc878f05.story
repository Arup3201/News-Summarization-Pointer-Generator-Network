A man has offered to fund an education for the men who allegedly tied him up, locked his housekeeper in a bathroom, and robbed his Texas home.

Police have launched a manhunt across Houston to find four men who they say posed as delivery men then threatened the homeowner at gunpoint before making off with cash, jewelry and guns from a safe.

And as an incentive for the alleged thieves, the victim, a physician, says he will pay for them to go to college to help them get out of a life of crime.

A priceless offer: This is a sketch of two of the four alleged burglars who are being offered the chance to go to college if they turn themselves in. They stand accused of raiding a Houston, Texas, home brandishing guns

There is no financial limit to the offer, they revealed. 

His wife Arielle Lawson told ABC13: 'We want to be able to say to them that they could make better choice, so they don't have any excuse in the future to look back and say they had to be felons or bad guys.'

'My husband is...very hurt. My children have been traumatized, and one of my children he cannot sleep at night,' she added.

According to investigators, the housekeeper answered a knock on the front door on October 17 to find both men wearing ski masks and brandishing handguns.

They were accompanied by a Hispanic man holding two cardboard boxes, they said.

'No limit': Arielle Lawson, whose husband was allegedly tied up by the thieves, said there is no financial limit

Targeted: The housekeeper (above) was locked in a bathroom by the gang posing as delivery men, police say

The pair are said to have locked the housekeeper in a cupboard then advancing on the homeowner.

Tying his hands behind his back, they marched him to the safe and ordered him to explain how to open it, investigators claim.

The suspects allegedly took cell phones from the homeowner and housekeeper then fled on foot, ABC7 reported.

Raided: The group took off with cash, jewelry and firearms from the home in Houston, Texas, it is claimed

Lawson's 11-year-old daughter said: 'I'm just glad that if the people do think about turning themselves in, they might be able to have a better education and go on with a different life instead of just being a criminal.'

Crime Stoppers is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest. The homeowners are offering a further $5,000.
