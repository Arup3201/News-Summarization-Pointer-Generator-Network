A woman was forced to have a mastectomy after a private clinic took nearly a year to pass on the results of a crucial scan that revealed she was suffering from breast cancer.

The X-ray showed Judith Dawson had a potentially cancerous tumour in her left breast but by the time she received the results from Medicentre 11 months later, it had grown into an aggressive 2in lump. 

The grandmother, 64, then endured months of gruelling chemotherapy and surgery which experts say could have been prevented. However, she is unable to bring a legal claim against Medicentre for the appalling blunder after the chain went into administration last year.

The firm, subsequently bought by another organisation, has also failed to apologise for the error.

Social worker Mrs Dawson, from Reading, said: ‘I was flabbergasted to receive an envelope in the post after 11 months. It said I needed a follow-up and originally I thought, “Well, a follow-up is fine.”

‘It wasn’t until I took it to my GP, who said the time-lapse was appalling, that I realised something was wrong. Within ten days I had seen a consultant and had a  tissue biopsy.

‘The tumour was too large by then to save my breast. I felt horribly let down. Doctors say the mastectomy wouldn’t have been necessary if someone had seen the X-ray results a year earlier. I can’t get anyone to admit they did anything wrong.’

The mother of four had regular health 
assessments with Medicentre because her employers, Wandsworth Council in
South London, had a contract with the company. In May 2009, she went 
for an annual check-up at its site in Waterloo and was referred to a 
respected Harley Street clinic for a routine mammogram because of her 
age.

It is understood the clinic sent the results on the same day by courier to Medicentre’s main office, with a recommendation that a further investigation be carried out immediately.

However, no action was taken. Mrs Dawson
contacted Medicentre in July 2009 to ask about the results but nothing 
was passed on, which she assumed was a good sign.

It was only after Medicentre rang her 
in April 2010 to make an appointment for another health check that the 
X-ray was posted to her home with a recommendation that it be ‘followed 
up’. Medicentre, which went into administration  in 2011, was later 
taken over by General Medical Clinics, but it still operates clinics 
under the Medicentre name.

Medicentre’s insurers, which would have been responsible for making a payout, deemed Medicentre’s policy invalid as one doctor working at the group was found not to have personal liability insurance.

Mrs Dawson’s solicitor Grainne Barton, from Hugh James, said: ‘We’re told the company’s insurance policy is invalidated by what is another administrative failing on  the part of Medicentre. They were obliged to ensure all of their doctors were insured but one wasn’t.’

HCA International, which owns General Medical Clinics, said: ‘As we did not own the company at the time it would be inappropriate to make any comment.’
