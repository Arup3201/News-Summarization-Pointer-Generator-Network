Twitter users have hit back at the GOP staffer who called Malia and Sasha Obama classless - by reminding her of Jenna Bush's more unseemly moments while her father was in office.

Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Rep Stephen Fincher, issued a groveling apology on Friday after slamming the President's girls, aged 16 and 13, for wearing casual clothing and looking sullen during the Thanksgiving address.

Calling for the self-professed media expert to be sacked, thousands of people responded by tweeting the renowned picture of George W Bush's daughter Jenna drunkenly tumbling over her friend on to the floor of a frat party, cigarette in hand.

The 2001 photo, which earned the then 19-year-old the nickname Jenna And Tonic, has gone viral with the hash tag '#classy'.

'Classy': Images of George W Bush's daughter have gone viral since the outburst on Thanksgiving Day

Open letter: Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Rep Stephen Fincher, wrote this to the girls

Other responses included a picture of the moment Jenna, one of the former president's twin daughters, stuck out her tongue at White House photographers while riding in the presidential limousine.

'Did you forget that jenna bush got photographed at the age of 19 knocking someone over at a FRAT party? good lord,' one Twitter user wrote.

Another commented: 'The Bush twins used fake ID's to get into bars. & Jenna Bush stuck out tongue at press. Is that "classy?" @DCGopGirl #tcot #UniteBlue.' 

One wrote: 'Where were your ignorant comments on the Palin family brawl, the Bush girls (Jenna & Tonic).'

'So Sasha and Malia Obama have no class? Two words: Jenna Bush. #ElizabethLauten,' one tweet read.

And one said: 'I have a feeling that Jenna Bush & sister are a little ticked off at #ElizabethLauten for bringing their past behavior into the spotlight.' 

By Saturday evening hundreds of people had demanded that Lauten lose her job as communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.) under the #FireElizabethLauten Twitter hashtag.

Lauten had apologized for her post, writing that 'judgmental feelings truly have no place in my heart', saying that 'hours of prayer' had shown the error of her ways. 

'Dear Sasha and Malia,' she wrote in the post, recorded by The Root reporter Yesha Callahan, 'I get you're both in those awful teen years, but you're a part of the First Family, try showing a little class.'

Lauten, communications director for Rep Stephen Fincher of Tennessee, added: 'Act like being in the White House matters to you. 

'Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.

'And certainly don't make faces during televised public events.'

Reaction: They prompted soft criticism for sullenly scowling at their father, the President, on Thanksgiving

Twitter users rushed to defend the girls who Lauten said 'deserve a spot at a bar' rather than the White House

Sasha, 13, was dressed in a short maroon dress with a long cream cardigan that matched her thick cream socks, worn over bare legs.

Her sister Malia, 16, wore black tights under a mini kilt with a grey and cream jumper.

After the President had pardoned the designated bird, a four-month-old 49-pounder called Cheese, he asked Malia if she wanted to pet the turkey.

'Nah', she replied, in a rare departure from her usual, gracious disposition, which prompted a flurry of remarks from viewers.

'Awful teenage years': The cyber-bullying post addressed to the young girls said they are at an 'awful' stage

Star Jones, a lawyer and television personality, was among those unimpressed. 'I’ve seen tacky people…but rarely seen someone as tacky as #ElizabethLauten for slamming the children of the #POTUS' she tweeted. 

One commenter, whose username is Eclectic John, wrote: '@RepFincherTN08 There is nothing that excuses what #ElizabethLauten posted re the children of our President. That's off limits. Fire her now.'

The incident was not Lauten's first social media slip-up.

In August, she posted a tweet from her boss's verified Twitter account about 'shagging'.

Apology: Hours later she removed the original outburst, issued an apology and set her page to private

Firing: Many Twitter users directed messages to Lauten's boss, Stephen Fincher

Stephen Fincher's followers were baffled when he tweeted: 'God I love this song. And beach music. AND shagging #pandora,' in reference to an Embers playlist on Pandora radio.

Lauten later deleted the post and apologized for the 'accident' - but insisted 'shagging' is a dance term rather than a sexual reference.

'It had nothing to do with Stephen Fincher. I don’t think he knows what Pandora is; he certainly doesn’t have it,' she said, according to Politico.

Following mass outrage to her post on Thursday, Lauten deleted it, set her profile to private, and issued an apology: 'I reacted to an article and quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager.

Other accusations: Lauten also took aim at Barack and Michelle Obama, saying they 'don't respect their roles'

Her critique was in response to a national broadcast of the annual White House turkey pardon

'After many hours of prayer, talking to my parents and re-reading my words online, I can see more clearly how hurtful my words were.

'Please know that these judgmental feelings truly have no pace in my heart.

'Furthermore, I'd like to apologize to all of those who I have hurt and offended with my words, and pledge to learn and grow (and I assure you I have) from this experience.' 

This year, Malia and Sasha were declared by TIME as two of its 25 Most Influential Teens of 2014.

In an interview earlier this year with Today, Michelle Obama told Jenna Bush Hager their family emphasizes health over appearance: 'We don’t talk about weight. We don't talk about physical appearance.

'We talk about health. We talk about what's on the inside. We spend so much more time talking to our girls about being kind and treating others well, and being passionate and respectful.' 

Reaction: Twitter users were outraged by Lauten's attack on the young girls on the national holiday
