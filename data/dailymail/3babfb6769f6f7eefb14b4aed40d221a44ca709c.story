Paul Pogba's agent Mino Raiola is '99 per cent' sure the Juventus star will reject the chance of sealing a summer move to the likes of Manchester United or Chelsea in order to stay at the Serie A champions.

The former Manchester United midfielder has been linked with a move to several of Europe's top sides during the last few months, however Raiola insists his client is keen on staying at the Juventus Stadium.

Raiola also revealed the seven clubs who are have stated their interest in the Frenchman - with Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea all said to be keeping a close eye on the 21-year-old's situation at Juventus.

'We made a pact with Juve: Paul doesn’t have to leave,' Raiola told Tuttosport.

'I spoke to president Andrea Agnelli, directors Pavel Nedved, Beppe Marotta and Fabio Paratici, so they all agree. The club doesn’t need the money.

'At this moment the situation at Juve is ideal for Pogba. We would only leave if a situation emerged that was favourable for all concerned.

'He is wanted by seven clubs and that is certain, because they all told me so. The ones that can afford him are Real Madrid, Barcelona, PSG, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea.

'If I just whistled, I’d sell Pogba tomorrow to PSG or City in a heartbeat. But Paul did not tell me to find him another club.

'What are his chances of staying? As of today it’s 99 per cent. Juve agree with our approach, which is that they will only sell if Paul asks to leave and there’s a suitable offer. Of course, it could become one per cent, it depends on the market.'
