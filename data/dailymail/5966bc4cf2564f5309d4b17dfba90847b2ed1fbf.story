When Michael Jarvis became Michelle, she shed a whopping ten stone and underwent a radical transformation.

The father-of-three had felt trapped in the wrong body his whole life and, depressed by his predicament, gorged on takeaways, chips and fry-ups to numb the pain, ballooning to 28st 7lb at his heaviest.

But the 52-year-old is now virtually unrecognisable after swapping trousers for skirts - and chocolate for salad.

Michelle Jarvis, 52, formerly Michael  says her decision to change gender helped her shed 10st, and is now living as a woman with wife of 10 years Lynn, 57, and their children Michael and Gwyneth (pictured right)

Michelle, whose wife Lynn is sticking by her, said: 'I always knew I was different, from a young age.

'I would take every opportunity to dress as a woman behind closed doors.

'I would hide myself away and eat mountains of food. I would eat in secret, it helped numb the pain. I would pile my plate high with as much food as possible. I would eat and eat and eat.'

Michael, as he was then known, of Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, had found himself trapped not only in the wrong body but also in a destructive cycle of over-eating to compensate for his misery.

He would gorge on fry-ups for his breakfast, chips for his lunch and a takeaway for his tea, snacking on chocolate and crisps in between.

It was in 2010, two years before he began dressing as a woman full-time, that Michael started to shed the pounds.

Michael shed six stone before he made the decision to become a woman. She is now known as Michelle and is happier than ever.

He radically changed his diet, swapping greasy fry-ups for healthy cereal, cutting out the snacks and walking for up to 14 miles a day.

Michael, now a full-time carer to wife Lynn, added: 'I started to feel better in myself. Then I seriously began thinking about changing my sex for good.

'After I began to dress as a woman full-time I lost even more weight. I think the hormones I was taking helped. For some reason I began to crave salad. I had never liked it much before.'

The former welder and taxi driver weighed 28st 7lb at her heaviest and has shed 10st in total.

However, the medication she takes to assist her sex change has meant that herweight fluctuates and she is now around 18st, and wants to lose more.

It was in 2013, after she had shed most of the weight, that she went to Benidorm on her own and spent her entire time among people she did not know,.

'It was then that I realised for sure I wanted to live as a woman permanently.

'I just felt so much more comfortable and so much more myself.' she added.

Michelle has been married to Lynn for 10 years and they have three children together; Michael, 18, Gwyneth, 13 and Tara, 19.

Lynn, 57, who suffers from a severe form of diabetes, has accepted her husband’s lifestyle choice and opted to stay with her.

Michelle added: 'I told my wife Lynn very early on that I liked to dress as a woman as a previous relationship had broken down because of it.

'She was understanding, but neither of us had any idea I would one day change sex.'

Lynn said: 'When he told me he wanted to live as a woman full-time I knew things would be difficult and I was shocked.

'But the most important thing is that Michelle is content in her own skin. I have always thought that.

'Of course, it has been hard. Our house has been vandalised and our children bullied as a result.

'I fell in love with a man - and now I am with a woman.

'But we’ve been together for so long. I simply do not know what I would do without her. She is still the same kind and generous person I first met.

'And I am so proud of her for losing so much weight. I couldn’t be happier for her.'

Michelle is due to undergo final gender reassignment surgery later this year.

She has set up support group Cleveland Transgender Association to lend support to transgendered people in her area as she felt there was very little on offer.
