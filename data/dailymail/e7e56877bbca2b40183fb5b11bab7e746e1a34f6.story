Thousands of pubs have agreed to serve weaker house wine as part of a deal by the drinks industry to head off tougher alcohol laws.

Industry chiefs met ministers on Monday to thrash out the latest stage in the Government’s ‘responsibility deal’ with the food and drink industry.

Representatives of more than 20,000 pubs and bars said they would offer lower-strength house wines containing no more than 12 per cent alcohol.

House wine is traditionally the biggest seller for most pubs and concern has grown at the increasing strength being offered in recent years.

Wines containing 14 per cent alcohol or more are no longer uncommon. Under the new guidance a typical bottle will contain no more than 12 per cent. It means a glass of house wine will contain about 14 per cent less alcohol.

However, Tory MP Philip Davies condemned the proposal as ‘nanny state nonsense’. Mr Davies said ministers should focus on cracking down on problem drinkers and yobs rather than interfering in the wider industry.

‘Why should the overwhelming majority of responsible drinkers be denied the drink of their choice because of a lunatic minority?’ he said.

‘This is a sort of nanny state measure I would expect from a Labour government – not a Conservative government.’

Health campaigners warned that the deal did not go far enough.

But ministers welcomed the package, which also includes a pledge by supermarkets to reduce the prominence of beer, wine and spirits in stores and a ban on big cans of super-strength lager and cider.

The drinks industry has also agreed to fund a small team to travel round schools to teach children about responsible drinking.

Home Secretary Theresa May said alcohol-fuelled harm costs the taxpayer £21billion a year and the drinks industry had a responsibility to help tackle the problem.

Mrs May said: ‘It is right that the alcohol industry is taking action to help reduce this burden, without penalising those that drink responsibly. We now look forward to seeing the positive impact of these pledges and continuing to work with industry to explore what else can be done to tackle alcohol abuse.’

But health campaigners condemned the backroom deal, saying it was no substitute for new laws such as a minimum price for alcohol, which was abandoned by the Government last year. They say the increasing strength of popular wines raises the risk of serious complaints such as liver disease.

Persuading manufacturers and retailers to reduce the strength of wines and beers is a key part of the Government’s drive to reduce alcohol harm without resorting  to legislation.

Sir Ian Gilmore, adviser to the Royal College of Physicians and chairman of the Alcohol Health Alliance, said: ‘It is frustrating to see the Government continually fail to take the action that is needed to effectively tackle increasing alcohol harms in the UK.

‘One person dies every single hour from alcohol-related causes. It is simply not good enough for the Government to rely on voluntary commitments from the alcohol industry, brokered behind closed doors, to deal with those problems.’

The agreement to curb the strength of house wine was made by the British Beer and Pub Association, whose members own more than 20,000 pubs and bars across the country. Ministers hope other pubs and restaurants will follow suit over time.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the so-called ‘responsibility deal’ would help take one billion units of alcohol out of the market in the coming years.

Ministers have acted to curb the practice of below-cost selling of wine, beer and spirits by supermarkets. But they rejected plans for minimum pricing last year amid fears it would alienate cash-strapped families.
