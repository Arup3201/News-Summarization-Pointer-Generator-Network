A Texas toddler died after shooting himself with a 9mm semiautomatic handgun he found while searching his great grandparents’ bedroom for gum on Wednesday afternoon.

Two-year-old Trenton Mathis from Cherokee County, east Texas, was pronounced dead at hospital in nearby Tyler after shooting himself in the face.

Trenton and three siblings had been removed from their parent’s home due to abuse and neglect late last year, said CPS officials.

Three of those children, including two-year-old Trenton, his five-year-old brother and ten-month-old sister, were placed with their great grandparents despite a CPS report claiming that their home wasn't safe for kids.

Another child, who will turn two next month, was placed in a foster home in Harris, because CPS felt the child had medical needs that could not be met by the great-grandparents.

Trenton’s brother and sister have now been taken into CPS custody.

Great grandmother Carolyn Mathis told KLTV that Trenton had gone looking for gum through a bedroom door that hadn't closed properly. He got onto her bed, and found the handgun on a nightstand.

Both Carolyn Mathis and her husband were present for the accidental shooting. It isn't clear whether they will face charges.
