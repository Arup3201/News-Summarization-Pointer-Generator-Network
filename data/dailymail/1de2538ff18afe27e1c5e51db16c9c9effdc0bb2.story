It sounds like one of the complex theories he is so good at making seem simple.

In fact, the ‘Cox Effect’ is the name given to the surge of interest in all things scientific when Professor Brian Cox appears on television.

Amazon has reported an extraordinary leap in sales of telescopes of almost 500 per cent thanks to the popularity of BBC2’s Stargazing Live.

The show, which is fronted by Professor Cox and Dara O’Briain, explores astronomy and the sky at night.

This year’s series has seen record ratings – peaking at 3.8million including those watching on HD – with audiences keener than ever to learn about the wider universe.

A spokesman for Amazon.co.uk said it saw sales of telescopes jump by 491 per cent after the first show aired on Monday night.

He said: ‘In the three hours following ‘Stargazing Live’ being aired, we saw an almost six-fold increase in sales of telescopes.

‘Each time the popular physicist appears on TV we see a jump in telescope sales and that would appear to point to a significant ‘Brian Cox effect’ encouraging a renewed interest in stargazing.’

Thousands took to Twitter to praise the star for making difficult theories more accessible.

Professor Cox, who used to be in pop band D:Ream, is hailed with making science 'sexy' again.

Academics and examiners have reported seeing a huge increase in students interested in maths and science subjects.

In
 2011, entries for A-level maths are up by just over 40 per cent over 
five years, while the number of entries for physics has risen by 19.6 
per cent and chemistry is up 19.4 per cent.

The TV physicist, who made his name presenting BBC2 series Wonders of the Universe, is credited with helping fuel the big rises.

He said in a recent interview he believed there had been a ‘step change’ in the public’s opinion of science.

Professor Cox said: ‘I go to schools and I see and hear there are a lot of kids, girls as well as boys, interested in science and engineering.

‘This is the message: that these subjects are great things to do – for the individual it’s great because there is a shortage of scientists and engineers, but it’s also great for the country, because our country needs these people to improve our economy in the 21st century.’
