Balenciaga has filed a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court in Manhattan accusing Steve Madden of making a ‘studied copy’ of its famous Motorcyle handbag.

According to the suit, Balenciaga is seeking an injunction that would forbid Steve Madden from selling the offending item, as well as monetary damages.

Court papers read: ‘The Defendant’s wholesale copying of Balenciaga’s designs is likely to deceive consumers into believing that the infringing [handbag] is associated with or authorized by Balenciaga when it is, in fact, not.’

Bag in question? While its not clear which bag Balenciaga is referring to in its suit, a likely guess would be Steve Madden's $88 'Btalia' bag which is currently for sale at retailers including Macy's and Nordstrom

While it is unknown which exact 
handbag Balenciaga has taken issue with, reports suggest that the $88 
Steve Madden ‘Btalia’, currently sold at Macy’s and Nordstrom, is the 
most likely candidate.

The 
French label, which is owned by parent company Kering, claims that Steve
 Madden has violated a trade dress regulation that the French fashion 
house filed in 2007.

A trade
 dress is a visual kind of trademark, which allows a brand to outline 
the aesthetic hallmarks of an item they wish to protect. Trade dress 
infringement suits are filed when a design’s original creator feels that
 a copy could lead to consumer confusion.

Balenciaga’s
 Motorcycle bag has been a celebrity favorite since its release in 2000.
 It was created by Nicolas Ghesquiere, who helmed the label from 1997. 
He was succeeded in 2012 by Alexander Wang.

The
 bag - which in its early days was carried by stars as diverse as 
Mary-Kate Olsen and Paris Hilton - became so popular that in 2007, 
Balenciaga filed a U.S. trade dress to protect the design from 
additional counterfeits (by this time, there had been many).

It
 outlines the Motorcycle bag’s design hallmarks that, if copied, could 
potentially cause consumer confusion.

According to The Fashion Law these key design features include: ‘The flat pouch 
with a zippered rectangular closure, a zipper pull consisting of a strip
 centrally-knotted and hanging in two equal lengths, and a 
semi-elliptical patch outfitted with two raised studs in each corner; 
and two identical patches in an elongated pentagonal shape, featuring an
 elongated hexagonal patch outfitted with a buckle and two raised 
studs.’

Famous fans: In its 14-year history the Motorcycle bag has enjoyed a diverse array of celebrity fans including Ashley Olsen (left, in 2007) and Kim Kardashian (right, in 2013)

These protections 
also apply to the Motorcycle bag’s collection counterparts like the 
Papier, Twiggy and Velo styles, which include the same zip and pocket 
closures in tote and clutch formats, rather than a satchel.

Information
 regarding litigation and settlement discussions has not yet surfaced, 
and representatives for neither Balenciaga nor Steve Madden were 
immediately available to return MailOnline’s requests for comment.

This
 is not the first time that Balenciaga has sought legal action against 
the brand. In 2009, it filed a similar trade dress suit, alleging that 
Steve Madden had copied the ‘LEGO’ high-heel from its fall 2007 
collection.

After a two-year battle, the two brands reportedly settled the matter out of court. Details of the settlement were not released.
