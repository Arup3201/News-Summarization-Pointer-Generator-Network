Sky is set to launch a download service it claims could make the morning commute far more enjoyable.

The Sky Go Extra service, which launches next week, will allow people to download films and TV show to their phone or tablet.

It puts Sky in direct competition with Apple's iTunes services, and Google's Play store.

The broadcaster said it expects the Sky Go Extra to be popular with commuters

The download service is an addition to Sky's Go app.

Users simply find the programmes or film they want, and click the download button.

It is then available on their device for 30 days, whether they have an internet connection or not.

Set to launch this week, the service 
will offer the 'majority' of Sky's catalogue, and will cost £5 a month 
for users of the firm's apps.

Blockbusters such as Avengers Assemble, Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows and Pirates In An Adventure with Scientists will all be available for download through the service, alongside the entire James Bond film catalogue, containing all twenty-two official Bond films.

Luke Bradley-Jones of Sky admitted the firm had been taken aback by the popularity of its Sky Go service, which allows people to watch its content on their phones and tablets.

'There has been a massive shift in behaviour from consumers due to content on demand,' he said.

'It's comparable to the introduction of live pause and rewind.

'We're connecting our customer's boxes to the internet, and consumption habits shift dramatically - and it's not all driven by the juggernaut of iPlayer, it shifts the shape of people's viewing habits.

'Being connected drives extra value for us customers, and really help people watch whenever they want - this is really the final piece of the puzzle.'

Sky also revealed what its customers are watching on 'catchup' - with Game of thrones being the most popular and 'boxsets'

Using the new service, people can also choose to download either standard or high definition versions, and once downloaded, they have 30 days to watch.

'People can download their favourite TV shows and movies, and watch them offline where they don't have a 3G or wifi connection,' he said.

Sky believes the service will offer better value for money that services such as Apple's iTunes, which charges users for every item they download - although users do then 'own' the content, compared to Sky's subscription model.

'People spend a lot of money buying content through iTunes and other places to watch when they commute or are on a plane, so we think this is good value,' said Mr Bradley-Jones.

The new app will run on iPads, iPhones and selected Android devices

The new service allows people to download as many films and shows as they can fit on their device
