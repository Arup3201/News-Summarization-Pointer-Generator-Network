The words 'Richie McCaw' and a 'below par performance in Scotland' is music to the ears of Vern Cotter and his coaching staff.

Unfortunately though for the Scotland coach, McCaw's display was on a golf course instead of a rugby pitch.

The New Zealand captain enjoyed a round of golf with his team-mates at East Lothian's Gullane Golf Club on Wednesday ahead of Saturday's match against Scotland at Murrayfield.

McCaw was all smiles as he Beauden Barrett, Israel Dagg and TJ Perenara played the course under the tutelage of two-time major golf champion Sandy Lyle.

And although their rugby credentials aren't in question, the same couldn't necessarily be said for their golfing pedigree with Perenara, in particular, finding himself in the rough at times.

Scotland will be hoping the quartet will be having a rough time too on Saturday when the Southern Hemisphere giants come to Murrayfield looking to protect their undefeated record against the Scots.

The last time the two sides met in Scotland two years ago New Zealand romped to a 51-22 win to stretch their unbeaten run to 29 Tests against the hosts.

Fresh from playing their part in a 24-21 win against England last week, the All Blacks quartet will be looking for a similar outcome on Saturday.
