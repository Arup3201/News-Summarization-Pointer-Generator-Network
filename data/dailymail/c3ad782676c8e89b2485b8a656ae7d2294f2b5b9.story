After going for a walk, a German shepherd puppy decided to go for a drive â€” straight into a pond.

John Costello, from Massachusetts said that his 12-week-old puppy, Rosie, was so excited Sunday after going for a walk at Bolivar Pond in Canton that she jumped in his running car, hit the gear stick and shifted into drive.

The pooch then fell onto the gas pedal and sending the car careening into the water.

Puppy power! A three-month-old German shepherd puppy is being blamed for driving a family car into a Massachusetts pond

What did I do? Could you really shout at a puppy with a face like this?

In the blink of an eye: Rosie's owner, John Costello says it all started after he'd taken his frisky puppy for a walk by Bolivar Pond in Canton. He hopped into his car, and started it up, but Rosie had her own ideas and knocked the car into drive

'The dog just jumped into the car and 
hit the gear shift ... when she slammed it into drive she fell on top of
 the gas pedal,' Costello told local television station WFXT-TV.

'The car went for a swim. We all did.'

A couple of passers-by saw the commotion and helped Costello rescue Rosie.

Nobody was injured, but Costello says the Dodge Neon is a total loss.

That sinking feeling: Both the Canton police and fire departments arrived at the pond to help out, and remove the car from the water

Taking it easy: Rosie is okay but unaware of all the commotion she caused

The 911 call surprised even police. Officer Robert Quirk says he has never heard of a dog driving into a pond.

The car was totaled after being completely submerged in the pond, but the dog and owner escaped unharmed.

'The perp says she was just going with the flow of traffic,' Quirk said in a Twitter post showing a picture of the puppy.

Eric Hermann, who was working nearby, rushed to help.

Friends again: Mr Costello leaped into the car, grabbed the dog and pulled her out. They both fell back into the water

Ready for more: The entire encounter provided quite a bit of drama and excitement for everyone involved

'It was about 30 feet out the car,' Mr Hermann said. 'The puppy was scared and ran to the back seat. The front door was open, [we were] trying to get her out the front door.'

'I just leaped in and grabbed the dog and pulled her out and we both fell back into the water,' said Mr Costello.

The water level soon rose to be over Hermann's head.

'By the time we got the puppy out, the car had slid and we had to do a little swimming,' he said.

But they all made it safely to shore in the end.
