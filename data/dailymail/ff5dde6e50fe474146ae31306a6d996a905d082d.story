If they were handing out gold medals for the best six pack at the Commonwealth Games, then Tom Daley would surely win.

The 20-year-old shows off his buff body in pictures set to feature in his 2015 calendar, which we can reveal here. Last year, the diver's 2014 offering was a bestseller and 2015's similarly racy version is likely to follow suit when it hits the shelves.

In most of the pictures, Tom appears without his top on revealing the super-toned physique that has made him one of Britain's top sportsmen.

Success: The calendar is on sale for £9.99, last year's offering was a bestseller

He was 
just 14 when he qualified for his first Olympics in Beijing and then won
 a bronze medal at the London 2012 Olympics for his dive off the 10m 
platform.

Tom
 wears his pride at being an Olympian on his sleeve - or rather tattooed
 on his arm - and the Olympics rings on his bicep can be clearly seen in
 numerous of his calendar poses.

The 
Plymouth-based athlete is currently in Glasgow for the Commonwealth 
Games where he's hoping to strike gold again. Four years ago in Delhi, 
he won two golds in the individual 10 metre platform and synchronised 
dive with Max Brick.

Aside
 from his sporting achievements, Tom has also launched a TV career, 
acting as a presenter and mentor on ITV show Splash! where he teaches 
celebrities how to dive.

Also this month, the star, who is dating screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, was voted Attitude Magazine's world's sexiest man of 2014. He took the accolade ahead of One Direction heart throb Zayn Malik, footballer David Beckham and actor Zak Efron.

Tom's success away from the pool has led to speculation he may soon retire from diving - but his spokesman insists he intends to carry on to compete in the Rio 2016 Olympics.

He said: 'Tom's working hard in training and his goal remains to compete in his third Olympic Games.'

The Tom Daley 2015 calendar costs £9.99 and is currently available to buy from http://pyramidshop.com/do/item/C13036/Tom-Daley-2015-Calendar
