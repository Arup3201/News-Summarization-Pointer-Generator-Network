Bonus: Royal Bank of Scotland CEO Stephen Hester was given £1m by RBS chiefs, despite a catalogue of failures and his decision to axe 3,500 jobs

The boss of state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland was handed an annual bonus of nearly £1million yesterday.

To widespread fury, the board of directors awarded Stephen Hester more than many ordinary workers earn in a lifetime.

The bank insists it has shown restraint because its chief executive was ‘entitled’ to £1.5million.

But David Ruffley, a senior Tory on the Treasury select committee, said: ‘Mr Hester is already paid a £1.2million basic salary, which seems to me generous given that the share price has fallen and RBS has failed to meet its lending targets set by the Chancellor.

‘It is therefore totally unacceptable that there should be a bonus of just under £1million for what in the rest of the private sector would be seen as sub-standard performance.’

John Mann, a Labour MP on the same committee, said: ‘It is a reward for failure. Giving him a bonus that just creeps under £1million is like sticking two fingers up at the taxpayer. The Government should have put their foot down and insisted that he gets nothing.’

The move comes just days after ministers announced a crackdown on executive pay and David Cameron said a seven-figure sum for Mr Hester would be unacceptable.

The Prime Minister said rewards for failure made ‘people’s blood boil’ when – in the words of the Bank of England governor – hard-up Britons were suffering ‘a ferocious squeeze’.

Mr Hester’s bonus is the first of many for staff at a bank in the process of laying off 3,500 employees.  

RBS’s share price, meanwhile, has slumped by 40 per cent, giving the taxpayer a paper loss of billions of pounds. Senior Government sources said they were satisfied Mr Hester’s bonus had been cut and insisted he had to be paid well or be lost to a better-paid job in the private sector.

Angry: David Cameron said that the rewards for failure make people's 'blood boil' while Labour's John Mann said that the payment was like 'sticking two fingers up at the taxpayer'

One source said: ‘We said it should be smaller than last year and we said it should be under £1million. It is. Last year, his bonus was £2.04million.

A senior Treasury source said: ‘We said we wanted the bonus to be significantly less and they have bowed to that.’

Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, said the bonus was fair, adding: ‘A safer and more valuable RBS is in the interests of our customers, shareholders and the UK economy.

‘We are progressing well toward this goal under the leadership of Stephen Hester.’

However, the boss of Lloyds Banking Group, which is also partly nationalised, has turned down a bonus which could have been up to £2.4million.

Antonio Horta-Osorio said his decision was triggered by ‘the tough financial circumstances that many people are facing’, as well as his two-month absence following a severe attack of insomnia.

Mr Hester’s bonus will be paid entirely in shares, allocated over the next three years. He has been given 3.6million, worth a total of £996,000 last night.

Mr Hester will be taxed on his bonus, although the exact size of the tax bill is unclear because there are many different structures a company can use to make a share-based bonus award.

Last night, experts said the most likely option is that he will have to pay income tax, currently 50 per cent, when the shares are awarded to him over the next three years.

Labour condemned the Government’s failure to get a better deal. Angela Eagle, shadow Commons leader, said: ‘The board of RBS is thinking of paying their chief executive in one day more than someone on average earnings would make in a lifetime. We have heard expressions of outrage from the Government benches but the question is: “What is it going to do about it?”

Lord Oakeshott, a LibDem peer, said: ‘It is time to block the bonus which is a clear reward for his failure to lend. He should certainly not got a penny in bonus. Britain cannot grow when one of its biggest banks does not lend.’

David Fleming, national officer at the union Unite, said: ‘What planet do Stephen Hester and his banking chums live on?’

He said the bonus was ‘utterly disgusting and offensive to every working person across the country’.

Sir Mervyn King, the Bank of England governor, has also voiced his disapproval of big bonuses at a time of financial hardship.

In a speech this week, he said: ‘The tragedy of the financial crisis is that those who have suffered most have been those who bear no responsibility for it.’

Criticism: Sir Mervyn King said it would be wrong if rewards go to a small elite earlier this week, while Angela Eagle asked what the Government were doing about it in a speech in the Commons

He added it would be wrong ‘if rewards go disproportionately to a small elite, especially one which benefited from the support of taxpayers.’ Royal Bank of Scotland’s share price has fallen almost 40 per cent in the past 12 months to close at 27.67p last night.

The bank fell slightly short of its target for lending to small firms under the government’s Project Merlin initiative to get credit flowing through the economy,

Critics argue the Merlin  goals are faulty as they measure banks’ ‘capacity’ to lend – the money they make available in theory.

Small firms claim the banks have hiked up loan charges and fees, deterring businesses from taking up the funds.

Under the terms of Merlin, RBS and the country’s other four biggest banks pledged to lend small and medium-sized firms £76billion in 2011. Between January and September, this should have seen them hand out £57billion – and they fell £1billion short. Lord Oakeshott said RBS, which is 83 per cent state owned following its bail-out in 2008, was ‘the worst culprit by far’ among the banks.

RBS earlier this month announced a further 3,500 job losses in its investment banking operation, on top of 2,000 announced previously.The bank has shed around 30,000 staff in the past two years, 22,000 of them in the UK.

Chris Leslie, Labour Treasury spokesman, said: ‘Nobody doubts that Stephen Hester has done some important things at RBS, but what this award shows is David Cameron’s promises about reining in excessive bonuses at state-owned banks or using shareholder power have proved to be utterly worthless.

‘Indeed, anyone who thinks it is acceptable to award a bonus of almost £1million on top of a basic salary of £1.2million in these tough times is desperately out of touch with millions of people who are struggling to make ends meet.’

But George Young, the Leader of the Commons, said: ‘The contract which entitles Mr Hester to a bonus was put in place by the last Labour government.

‘We have done something which they failed to do. We have limited cash bonuses to £2,000 at RBS and Lloyds.

‘We’ve already said the bonus pool at RBS and Lloyds will be lower and more transparent this year than last year.’
