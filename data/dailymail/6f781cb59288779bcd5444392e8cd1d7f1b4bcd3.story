Leyton Orient, Crawley, Stevenage and Luton. Now there are just four of the FA Cup minnows who have surpassed Newcastle United by making it to the fifth round in recent seasons.

Not since 2006 – in a pre-Mike Ashley era – have the Magpies progressed beyond the fourth round. You can add MK Dons, Oldham Athletic and Bristol Rovers to a list of lower-league teams who have outshone Ashley’s Newcastle in a competition they have won six times.

Indeed, their tradition and history is best illustrated by the FA Cup and the team of the 1950s – led by Jackie Milburn – who lifted the famous trophy three times in five years.

Today, however, they are the only football club in the land who have gone on record in deprioritising the 144-year-old competition. Such policy has certainly been played out on the pitch.

In fact, no top-flight club better – or worse - demonstrates the demise of the FA Cup and its relevance in a climate where the Premier League cash cow is the only competition worth milking.

Since gaining promotion back to the top division in 2010, Newcastle have won just one FA Cup match. They have been eliminated by Stevenage, Brighton (twice), Cardiff and Leicester. Twice they have made seven changes for a third-round defeat and twice they have made five.

On Saturday, during the sorry 1-0 surrender at Leicester in which star players Daryl Janmaat, Fabricio Coloccini, Moussa Sissoko, Jack Colback and Ayoze Perez were rested by caretaker boss John Carver, supporters made their feelings known. ‘We’re s***t and we’re sick of it’ was the terrace put-down, followed by disgust when they waved their own players away as they attempted to applaud a 4,300-strong following.

The Toon Army have had enough. Their team are tenth in the table, 10 points clear of the relegation zone, seemingly needing just 13 more to hit 40 and renew their Premier League status and, more importantly from a boardroom perspective, bolster the owner’s bank balance for one more season at least. Why, then, did they so brazenly disrespect this season’s FA Cup?

Club legend Alan Shearer said he was ‘annoyed, angry and surprised’ when Alan Pardew named a weakened side in last year’s third round, while John Anderson, who played 337 times for Newcastle and was at Leicester on Saturday, is another former favourite who cannot understand the approach.

‘It’s baffling why they do not value the cups when they’re in the position they are in the league,’ he told Sportsmail.

‘I was at the game on Saturday and so were more than 4,000 Newcastle fans and I could not believe the team when I heard it - it’s taking a lend of fans when they’ve paid good money to be there.

‘They weren’t happy and they had every right not to be. It was like a practice match and, to be honest, neither team wanted to win it.

‘Leicester would have been just as happy to get beat you feel. But they’re fighting to stay in the league and you can understand their changes to a degree – their priority is survival.

‘But Newcastle only need another three or four wins and they’ll be fine. So now you’re left with a scenario where the season is pretty much over in January.

‘What are they playing for? To finish as high as possible in the league? Well you’d even doubt that because the Europa League is just as much as a distraction to them as the FA Cup.’

Anderson himself only made it to the fifth round on three occasions during 10 years on Tyneside. But the former Republic of Ireland international says there was never a question of certain competitions taking precedence.

‘Listen, our record in the FA Cup wasn’t great, but it wasn’t for the want of trying, we just weren’t good enough,’ he said.

‘We named our strongest side in every match and I appreciate things have changed in that respect, but clubs like Newcastle and those around them in the Premier League should be having a right good go at the cups.

‘They aren’t going to get in the top four, they aren’t going down and they’ve got supporters who work hard all week and follow them all over the country in their thousands.

‘Newcastle aren’t the only ones guilty of this but it’s killing the cup and you end up with matches like Saturday which just feel like an inconvenience for both teams.’

There, in one word, Anderson captures the sad slide of the FA Cup – has it really become an inconvenience?
