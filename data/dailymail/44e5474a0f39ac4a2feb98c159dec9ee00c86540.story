Pippa Middleton donned a traditional Austrian dirndl complete with 'bust-boosting blouse and a pinny' for her latest travel writing venture about an Alpine festival.

The outdoorsy 30-year-old was certainly dressed the part for her feature, in which she visited the Jahrmarkt festival in Kitzbühel, Austria – a traditional celebration of schnitzel, beer and bratwurst.

She wore a short-sleeved white blouse under the dirndl - a historical costume of Alpine peasants - with a quaint floral pinny wrapped around her waist.

Writing about the trip in her latest piece for the Daily Telegraph, Pippa described her traditional outfit as being 'a dashing dirndl with a bust-boosting blouse and a pinny to give an approachable, girl-next-door look that Austrians like.'

For the piece, the Duchess of 
Cambridge's sister posed for various photos around the festival and even
tried her luck at Bavarian nail-hammering game Nagelbock.

Fun: Pippa Middleton obviously enjoyed her trip - saying she planned to return to the area later in the year

In other images, which can be viewed on the Telegraph website, Pippa posed next to a stall adored with gingerbread delights and then another laden with schnapps.

Pippa embarked on various adventures for her piece, including skiing, hiking, dancing and gorging on traditional delicacies.

The piece begins with the columnist describing her 'burning thighs' as she descends the notorious Hahnenkamm ski course before complaining about her easyJet bag weight limit not allowing room for her walking boots.

Eventually, Pippa arrives at the festival and remarks: 'There is only one way to enjoy this and that’s to enter fully into the fun.

'I was easily lured by the prospect of dancing in a dirndl, sampling every wurst imaginable, sniffing suspiciously and then knocking back the flavoured schnapps at various stalls, while using the one word of German I felt comfortable with (bitte) over and over.'

Pippa goes on to describe sampling another delicacy - the pretzel - but says she only managed to eat half on it because of the tight-fitting drindl

She added that she attempted a Bavarian jig and a bit of shoe-slapping, but her dancing skills were less than to be desired - especially in front of the 'lederhosen-clad boys'.

Happy couple: Pippa Middleton and boyfriend Nico Jackson arrive at Edinburgh Airport today

Pippa, who is also a columnist for Vanity Fair, obviously enjoyed her visit, promising at the end of her piece that she would 'need to find an excuse to return'.

Last week, Pippa wrote about flower arranging for her lifestyle column in the Telegraph, adding that she loves to join the 'savvy church flower arrangers and DIY brides' at Covent Garden Flower Market in London.

The column lead to speculation that Miss Middleton, who is currently dating Nico Jackson, had marriage plans on her mind.
