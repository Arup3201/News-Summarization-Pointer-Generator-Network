Offenders: Lord Selsdon said he found that British families travelling in large 4X4 cars to go skiing in the Alps were the most badly behaved

Most of us don’t have the time or the energy to reprimand anti-social drivers who drop litter out of their car windows.

But it seems Tory peer Lord Selsdon has both these gifts – and good connections to boot.

In an extraordinary outburst in a 
House of Lords debate yesterday, the 75-year-old told colleagues how he 
calls his ‘friends at the DVLA’ to obtain the vehicle owner’s phone 
number.

Lord Selsdon said he records the number plates of British cars when abroad if sees litter being dumped on the road before calling up his friends at the DVLA.

The peer claimed the DVLA would then use the details to find the telephone numbers of offenders before handing them over.

But with a possible threat to data 
protection laws, the DVLA said it was trying to contact the hereditary 
peer before considering launching a full probe.

The
Data Protection Act requires organisations such as the DVLA to keep the
personal information they are processing secure and to have controls on
making sure such information is not inappropriately accessed.

But
Lord Selsdon told the House of Lords that he found that British 
families travelling in large 4x4s to go skiing in the Alps were the most
badly behaved.

The peer said: ‘I find when you look at 
the international scene that, believe it or not, some of the most badly 
behaved now are British families in large 4x4s driving to the Alps to 
ski.

‘They
are the ones I've followed occasionally and, for a bit of fun, I've 
just taken note of their number and occasionally manage - because I have
friends with DVL(A) - to find their telephone and I give them a ring.

‘I
just say, ‘I'm sorry I happen to be involved in the political world a 
bit and it was noticed that at a particular point you did this”.

‘And
of course most continental motorways have got signs every kilometre or 
every half kilometre or often more often so you know exactly where you 
are and so do the spies.

Rubbish: Tory peer Lord Selsdon said he notes down the number plates of British cars he sees littering abroad

‘If the police themselves are deciding 
that they may be perhaps a little short of income for Christmas, the 
number of fines seems to go up.

Lord Selsdon's speech on littering comes as he marks his 50th anniversary in the House of Lords.

An ex-Naval officer, he took his seat in 1963 after his father's.

The 76-year-old is one of just 90 hereditary peers left on the red benches.

He worked in business and banking before entering Parliament.

He lists skiiing among his interests and has been President of the Anglo-Swiss society, which might explain how he spots the littering drivers in the Alps.

He once launched a campaign to find out if there was a legal definition of the role of a peer. He was told there wasn't.

'There is of course absolutely no connection between these two issues. But this is self-interest.’

Lord Selsdon made the surprise admission during a debate on a legislation drawn up by former journalist, Tory Lord Marlesford, which calls for anyone caught throwing rubbish out of a vehicle to be fined.

Under the Littering from Vehicles Bill, a registered driver would be the automatic recipient of the fine.

The Bill, which stands little chance of becoming law, would require local authorities to publish the details of the contracts awarded in relation to its enforcement.

A spokeswoman for the DVLA said: ‘We are writing to Lord Selsdon to ask him for further information.

‘Depending on his reply, we will then decide on whether or not it is necessary to conduct a full investigation.’

She said drivers were not obliged to provide their telephone numbers when applying for a licence so that in some cases the agency would not hold the details apparently requested by Lord Selsdon.

Investigation: The DVLA said it would contact Lord Selsdon before deciding whether to launch a probe into the potential breach of data protection laws

The spokeswoman added: ‘We take our responsibility to protect information seriously. That is why information is only provided under strict controls to those who are legally entitled to it, such as local authorities and the police.’

A spokesman for the Information Commissioner said: ‘We expect any organisation handling personal information to have appropriate safeguards in place to ensure that access to people's details is strictly controlled.

'These arrangements must be effective in practice.’
