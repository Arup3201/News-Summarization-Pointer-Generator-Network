The stopped watch, pipe and other last possessions of a First World War hero have gone on display 99 years after his death.

The belongings of 36-year-old Harold Llewellyn Twite include his mud-encrusted watch which was stopped at 8pm on 1 December 1915 - the exact moment he was killed by a German mine in the Somme region, northern France.

But the objects, covered in the mud from the tunnels in which Lieutenant Twite died, were only discovered 99 years later because his heartbroken widow Lucy Muriel Twite was too distressed to look at them.

The watch worn by Lieutenant Twite was frozen at 8pm on 1 December 1915, the exact moment he was killed by a German mine. The watch lay untouched for 99 years after his widow was too heartbroken to look at it

His grandson David Chilcott found the sacred items just this year and has donated them to the St Agnes Museum in Cornwall, in Lieutenant Twite's home village.

After his death, Lieutenant Twite's surviving comrades scoured the French frontline where he fought to gather his kit bag, letters, binoculars and other belongings.

They then posted them back to Sutton, Surrey, where Lieutenant Twite's family was living at the time.

But his widow could not bear to open the parcel and his daughter had just a brief look before it was packed away.

The mementos then lay untouched, covered in the mud from the Somme tunnels in which he had battled, for nearly a century.

It was then only this year that Lieutenant Twite's grandson David Chilcott, also from Cornwall, stumbled across them.

Lieutenant Twite was working overseas as a mining engineer when war was declared.

He returned home to sign up and was seconded to the 183rd (Tunnelling) Company of the Royal Engineers.

An expert in digging tunnels and sinking shafts, Lieutenant Twite was put in charge of a team of Cornish miners.

The team's job was to tunnel under the German trenches in northern France to lay explosives.

His team had just retreated in December 1915, after setting a series of charges, when the enemy detonated a huge mine.

The blast killed him and four of his fellow countrymen.

After Lieutenant Twite's death fighting in the Somme region of northern France, his pipe and binoculars were sent back to his widow, who was living in Sutton, Surrey at the time, by his comrades

They are buried in Citadel New Military Cemetery at Fricourt, a village on the Somme, near Albert.

Lieutenant Twite's widow commissioned a memorial plaque in her local church to honour her husband and his dead comrades. She also wrote to their families to pay her respects.

When the items were found, Mr Chilcott donated them
 to the St Agnes Museum where they will feature as part of a memorial 
exhibition, marking the Great War's centenary.

Museum spokeswoman Liz Thompson said the personal nature of the items offered a tangible reminder of the terrible loss suffered by soldiers' families.

She said: 'His widow never opened it, 
his daughter looked at it once, and his grandson, David Chilcott, 
generously offered it to us. We were amazed when David brought it in.

'Among the possessions are his shirt, pipe and mud-encrusted watch, stopped at precisely 8pm, the time of his death.

'There is a letter to his widow, written by a fellow officer from the battlefield, and a great deal of correspondence.'

The exhibition will also include a sketch pad containing drawings from an unknown artist.

In late 1914, it became clear that new tactics were needed for both sides to break through the enemy's entrenched positions.

So the British Army employed companies of engineers to start digging attacking tunnels under the enemy lines.

Tunnelling would involve digging under the enemy lines, placing explosives in the tunnels and blowing them up.

Once a tunnel was discovered, it would be destroyed by the enemy.

For the infantry above ground, the wait 
for underground explosions was nerve-wracking.

For the men underground, the explosions often meant sudden death.

It became a good way of moving into an enemy territory. But there was a constant struggle to 
find the areas where the conditions were most favourable - and to rebuild in areas which had been targetted by the enemy.

As the two sides created tunnels and counter tunnels, there were many underground encounters.

Sometimes
 a tunnelling team would break into an enemy position and meet the 
enemy underground. This would lead to fighting in the tunnels.
