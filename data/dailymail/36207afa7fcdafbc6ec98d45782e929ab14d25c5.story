Christopher Bridger pictured leaving court. Today he was found guilty of assaults on three separate women

A paramedic was today warned he faces a long prison sentence after a jury convicted him of rape and sex assault charges.

Christopher Bridger, 25, used a ruse that he was gay to get close to three women victims before attacking them when they were drunk after boozy nights out.

One of the women he assaulted was passed out drunk in a hotel bed with her lesbian lover, while another was a fellow student at St George's University Hospital.

The South East Coast Ambulance Service paramedic was found guilty of one count of rape and four other sex abuse charges following a 12-day trial at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey.

Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith warned Bridger that he faced a long prison sentence as he remanded him in custody ahead of his sentencing on September 5.

The judge ordered a pre-sentence report to be conducted, and said: 'You have been convicted by this jury of some very serious sexual offences. The consequence of that conviction is inevitably a lengthy custodial sentence.'

Bridger had 
denied all the allegations, accusing all of his victims of lying and 
putting them through the ordeal of giving evidence at his trial.

He
 was acquitted of two further charges of sex assault by penetration and a
 sex assault, which had been alleged by two other women he knew.

The first victim was a fellow student in September 2008, while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George’s University Hospital in London.

He raped the drunk student paramedic at St George’s University Hospital after accompanying her back to her halls following a Freshers’ Week fancy dress party.

She told how he started cuddling and kissing her, despite her asking him to stop. He then raped her, but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.'

The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong.

He then began working for South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust in 2010.

A lesbian colleague told the jury how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at a staff Christmas party the following year.

She had been arguing with her girlfriend, who started recording her drunken rant on her mobile phone.

Audio of that recording was played to the jury, during which Bridger is heard to come into the room and ask the woman for a hug and a kiss, which she obliged to, thinking he was gay.

Afterwards, Bridger climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn’t understand what had happened.

The day after was Bridger’s birthday and he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour.

One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.'

Bridger claimed the incidents were just 'drunken fumbles' and that the women were lying

Another said: 'You don’t have to forgive me, I’m just telling you the truth. I’m ashamed of myself.'

His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay the night at her house after a dinner in October 2012.

The court heard all the women had been told by Bridger - and believed him - that he was openly gay.

Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to his bosses in late 2012.

Following an internal NHS inquiry, Surrey Police arrested Bridger in January 2013 and he denied any involvement, telling detectives that he was a gay man who had been in several same sex relationships.

He had been separately arrested by the Metropolitan Police and questioned in relation to the allegations while he was a student paramedic.

Bridger did admit having sex with his rape victim but claimed that it was consensual and an experience 'that confirmed I am gay.'

He claimed the other incidents had just been 'drunken fumbles' and that the women were lying.

Bridger was convicted of rape, two counts of sexual assault, one sexual assault by penetration, and one charge of engaging in a sex act without consent.

He was acquitted of two further charges of sex assault by penetration and a sex assault, which had been alleged by two other women he knew.

Bridger, of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, had denied all the charges. He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at Guildford Crown Court on September 5.
