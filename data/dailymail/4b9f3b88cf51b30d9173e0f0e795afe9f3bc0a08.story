A couple in Oregon believe that they recorded footage of a UFO hovering and zigzagging across the sky on the very same day that a huge meteor blast injured over 1,000 people in Russia.

Flying saucer skeptics Heather Scherffius and Gregory Soldner were outside their Grants Pass home at 10.30 pm on February 15 when they think they witnessed something that can't be explained.

As reported by the International Business Times, the pair filmed the object on camera and say it 'looked like a metal disk of some sort.'

Mysterious: The couple say the object was metallic and moving at angles they have never seen any aircraft or object move before

Skeptics: The couple say they don't believe in flying saucers but they had never seen anything like this before

Scherffius told the IBT: 'At first I was like what's wrong with that star? I thought, whoa, that's kind of trippy. So I went to get him and he's like whoa! What is that? And it started moving.'

'It moved up and down, back to one spot and then zigzagged a bit. It was there like 20-30 minutes and then it was just gone!' according to Soldner.

The man said he doesn't believe in flying saucers but that he'd never witnessed anything like this before.

'It looked like a metal disk of some sort. I'm not sure, but it was metal and the way it moved was weird,' Soldner added.

The low-quality video recorded by the couple is inconclusive. NBC have added a filter to make the mysterious object clearer.

Evidence: The pair recorded the video on this digital camera

Kyle Aevermann, a news reporter at NBC affiliate KOBI-TV, told The 
Huffington Post: 'Both Greg and Heather described the object as metallic, occasional 
blinking lights and moving at angles they have never seen any aircraft 
or object move before.

'They claim it moved at 90-degree angles. 
It's very hard to tell in the clip because they weren't using a tripod 
and the clip itself wasn't the best quality since it was filmed on their
digital camera,' Aevermann added.

NBC contacted the Federal Aviation Administration to see if any other potential UFO sightings had been recorded that day.

The FAA said that very few UFOs were actually reported but an investigation is ongoing.
