Croatian Milan Sarcevic is accused of taking part in the 1991 Vukovar massacre

Just three of the 200 suspected war criminals found in Britain in the past 18 months have been removed from the country.

Suspects identified by border officials are accused of systematic killing, torture and rape in countries such as Afghanistan, Rwanda and Zimbabwe. More than 30 have been given the right to stay here.

Campaign groups said the figures showed Britain was a ‘safe haven’ for war criminals.

Earlier this week the Daily Mail revealed that a former Serbian soldier accused of involvement in one of the worst atrocities of the Balkans war was allowed to stay in Britain because of his human rights.

Milan Sarcevic is accused of  taking part in the 1991 Vukovar massacre when 300 wounded Croats were beaten, executed and buried in a mass grave.

The 60-year-old – who denies any wrongdoing – came to Britain more than a decade ago and, when he was refused asylum, returned to Croatia in September 2002.

But just eight months later he was allowed back in to Britain to put in another asylum claim. This year an immigration judge ruled that evidence of his involvement in the atrocity was ‘not conclusive’, and said Sarcevic must be allowed to stay because of his family rights under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act.

Last year it emerged that a former henchman of Robert Mugabe was given refuge in this country.

Phillip Machemedze tortured political opponents of the Mugabe regime, but he was given the right to stay in Britain in case he faced ill-treatment when returned to Zimbabwe.

Home Office figures, released under Freedom of Information rules, showed that more than 800 people were investigated between June 2010 and the end of last year over potential involvement in war crimes.

Of those, further action was recommended against 207. But just three have been removed from the country.

Another 32 have been told they can stay here – including 15 on human rights grounds – and two have been given British citizenship.

The remainder are still under investigation, having their cases reviewed, appealing against a decision to remove them or awaiting removal having lost their case.

The figures appear to suggest war crimes suspects see Britain as a potential home.

Dr James Smith, chief executive of the Aegis Trust, which campaigns against genocide, said: ‘Aegis successfully campaigned for a change in law to allow the prosecution of genocide and war crimes suspects residing in the UK, but unless that law is applied, the UK will remain a safe haven for people responsible for the worst crimes known to humanity.

‘The question is, how many of the suspects identified by UK Border Agency have been fully investigated by the police and how many investigations are currently in progress?’

A Border Agency spokesman said: ‘The Government makes no apologies for refusing people access to the UK if their presence is not conducive to the public good.

‘We are determined to ensure the UK does not become a refuge for war criminals. If it is not possible to remove them immediately – for example, if we have been over-ruled by the courts – these individuals can now be subjected to stringent reporting and employment restrictions while we continue to seek their removal.’
