Baby-snatch: 30-year-old Gabriela Osorio pleaded guilty to trying to murder a new mother and stealing her week-old daughter

A California woman desperate to have a baby who faked pregnancy for nine months and stabbed another young mother to steal her newborn daughter, will spend years in jail, she was told yesterday.

Gabriela Osorio was sentenced to 24 years in prison over the brutal attack and kidnapping in Santa Ana, California, in May 2010, the Orange County Register reports.

Osorio, 28, befriended the 26-year-old Hispanic victim and her week-old baby, bringing around gifts for the child.

But unbeknown to her, Osorio had been faking a pregnancy for nine months.

She told her boyfriend and family she had given birth two months before but her daughter remained in hospital with a medical problem.

Desperate to cover her lie and to be a mother, she searched hospitals and baby clinics for a baby to kidnap before finding her victim.

She turned up at the victim's home unannounced in May 2010 and attacked her - first attempting to suffocate her, then stabbing her three times in the ribs, shoulder and back of the neck .

The victim bit off the top of Osorio's finger in the struggle and managed to make it outside, where she called for help.

Her neighbors and brothers heard her calls and confronted Osorio, who was still armed with a knife.

She threatened to harm the baby but handed the child over to a neighbor when police arrived.

The troubled woman pleaded guilty, yesterday, to attempted murder, kidnapping of a child under the age of 14, first-degree residential burglary, criminal threats and false imprisonment by violence.

She also admitted three felony counts of aggravated assault with a knife causing great bodily injury, according to a statement from the Orange County district attorney’s office.

She had told her family and boyfriend she had given birth in March but her baby was unwell in hospital.

She had successfully faked pregnancy for nine months.
