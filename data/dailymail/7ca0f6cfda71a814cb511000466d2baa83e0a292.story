Any working mother will tell you that trying to raise children while also holding down a busy job is extremely tiring and very hard work.

So, spare a thought for super mum Amanda Owen, who not only tends to a flock of 1000 sheep every day on a sprawling, remote farm, but also balances that with raising her brood of seven children.

The 39-year-old shepherdess runs a 2,000-acre sheep farm from a village in the beautiful Yorkshire Dales.

Amanda, who was born in industrial Huddersfield, moved to the remote farm 20-years ago with Clive after being inspired by James Herriot books

Amanda usually takes her children out to the fields with her everyday while working on her farm

She shares the ancient house on the farm with husband Clive and their seven children; Raven, 13, Reuben, ten, Miles, 
seven, Edith, seven, Violet, Sidney and baby Annas.

And the family are so far away from shops and services that all but two of her children were born en route to the hospital because it is a two hour drive over treacherous roads.

Her children rarely visit shops or cinemas and muck in with the work at Ravenseat Farm in the village of Keld, North Yorkshire, as soon as they're old enough to walk.

She takes her three youngest children Annas, Sidney and Violet out into the fields with her every day

Amanda said: 'Life is extremely busy, and it is just a case of fitting everything in.

'I not only have all my kids to feed, but also all of the sheep as well.

Sidney, two, carries one of the chickens as he helps to round them up at Ravenseat

Amanda and her husband Clive sort out some of the new born lambs prior to giving them health checks. Working to the rhythm of the seasons the farm has over 900 Swaledale sheep that are now entering the lambing season as well as cattle and horses

'This morning I got up at 4am to see to the animals. When you live where you work, then it is non-stop. You can never switch off. It is hard work but I wouldn't have it any other way.

'I don't have to choose between my kids and my job, I have it both ways.

'You also get a lot of head space, and time to think.'

The busy mother lives at the farm with her husband Clive, 57, and they share the work together.

Their duties include lambing, feeding the sheep, bringing them down from the moors and maintaining the farm.

Amanda, who was born in industrial Huddersfield, moved to the remote farm 20-years ago with Clive after being inspired by James Herriot books.

She dreamed of an old fashioned life in the Yorkshire Dales, but feared that the profession she wanted to join no longer existed.

Amanda is well-known to viewers of the ITV series, The Dales which shone a spotlight on those who live and work in the area

Amanda started at the very beginning, learning the basics, before moving into Ravenseat, after striking up a relationship with Clive who already lived there.

Amanda is well-known to viewers of the ITV series, The Dales. Presented by Adrian Edmondson, the programme shone a spotlight on those who live and work in the area and the Owens were one of the undoubted stars of the show.
