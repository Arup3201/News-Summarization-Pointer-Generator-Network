His first match in charge will be against Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur on October 11.

The former England midfielder will lead the team at the 2015 AFC Asian Cup in Australia where Jordan are in the same group as Japan, Iraq and Palestine.

Jordan are ranked 56th in the world by FIFA, sandwiched between Finland and South Korea and 10 places above the Republic of Ireland.

The JFA said on its official website that its president HRH Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein had chosen Wilkins

It said Wilkins had accompanied Prince Ali to the team’s training session on August 28 to 'take a closer look at the team and observe the technical and fitness side of Al-Nashama (the team’s nickname)'.

The JFA said he had then studied videos of the team’s matches.
