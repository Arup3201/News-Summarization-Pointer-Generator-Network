A new delivery service takes hate mail to a whole different level.

ShipYourFriendsNothing.com allows users to anonymously send blank letters to recipients in a bid to trigger feelings of 'disappointment, sadness, confusion and possibly anger'.

A regular-sized envelope costs $3.99 while a larger piece of wordless mail comes in at $8.99. The company has a calligrapher to handwrite addresses while the paper stuffed inside is left untouched. 

A product description on the website reads: 'They rip open the envelope to find extreme disappointment, sadness, confusion and possibly anger. But hey, at least it wasn’t a bill right?'

Although the company is based in the U.S., the ominous notes can be sent out globally. 

Siri Freeh, a radio personality from Minnesota, recently tested out the service and pranked her co-worker.

Video footage  shows Freeh's colleague opening his Ship Your Friends Nothing letter with a look of disappointment and confusion washing over him.

He is seen looking on the floor below him in a bid to find the missing contents of his mail. 

However, after a brief search, he's literally left lost for words. 

The Ship Your Friends Nothing concept is reminiscent of the Australian-based site ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com, which was recently sold by its founder, Matthew Carpenter, for more than $80,000.

The creator of Ship Your Friends Nothing, who chose to remain anonymous, told the Daily Dot that he was directly inspired by his sparkly predecessor.

'I created Ship Your Friends Nothing after thinking how awful it would be to get sent glitter,' he said.

'I ultimately wanted to create something that would have a longer-lasting effect than a quick glitter bomb, that being nothing. Nothing has the power to linger in the recipient’s mind for days, weeks, or even months.'

Apparently Ship Your Friends Nothing has caught on quickly and there have been more orders than anticipated,

Its founder added: 'There is one customer on their second order that is going to the same address, which I hadn't thought of but now find absolutely brilliant.'
