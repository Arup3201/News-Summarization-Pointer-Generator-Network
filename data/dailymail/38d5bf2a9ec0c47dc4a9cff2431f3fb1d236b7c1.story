Arsene Wenger admits teenager Calum Chambers has ‘hit the wall’ and needs a break from the rigours of life in Arsenal’s back line.

Chambers has started 23 times for club and country this season, far more than Wenger envisaged. The Londoners have lapsed occasionally into defensive chaos, summed up by Sunday’s stoppage-time equaliser at Liverpool. 

Per Mertesacker shouldered the criticism after the 2-2 draw, having ducked away from the corner which was headed home by Martin Skrtel, but the Arsenal boss backed his 6ft 6in German, accusing his team of failing to organise properly.

He also admitted Chambers was feeling the strain and a rest may come during the festive fixtures, with Mathieu Debuchy and Nacho Monreal fit again.

Wenger said: ‘For a 19-year-old, he has played too many games. They all hit the wall after 15-17 games. You have to give them a breather. To have that level of responsibility in every single game is a lot at that age.’

The Arsenal boss preferred right back Debuchy rather than Chambers at centre half against Liverpool.

‘Debuchy is good in the air and at Stoke we suffered in the air,’ he said. ‘Sometimes experience can make a difference and the defensive responsibility is a bit less on the flanks.’

With Debuchy and Laurent Koscielny suffering serious injuries and a shortage of cover, Mertesacker has played every minute of Arsenal’s last 23 games in the Barclays Premier League and the Champions League.

‘Mertesacker gives his best,’ said Wenger. ‘Many people had a go at him for the corner but he had no chance to get that ball in the zone where he was. I don’t know why he ducked. Maybe he sees he hasn’t got the ball and somebody jumps over him and it’s a reflex.

‘It is more an organisational and collective problem because nobody really talks. We work on it. Usually we’re not bad on set-pieces. We have one of the best records in the league. Maybe they do talk but it doesn’t look like that when you see the pictures. It’s important to have someone organising.’

Mertesacker admitted earlier this season that he found motivation hard after the World Cup, but Wenger believes the 30-year-old German, who has since retired from international football, has improved. ‘It has not been easy for him,’ said Wenger. ‘He had a difficult start to the season but he’s been much sharper. I believe he’s on the way up. When Koscielny comes back, we will be more stable.

‘Even in midfield we need to get players back and to defend better. Mikel Arteta is missed because he’s a better ball-winner than people think.’ Arteta has not played for nearly a month, suffering a calf injury and then an ankle problem.
