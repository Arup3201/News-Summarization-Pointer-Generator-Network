An American who co-wrote a book called How to Survive the Running of the Bulls has been badly gored by a bull at Pamplona's San Fermin festival.

The author, Chicago resident Bill Hillmann, 32, tripped and fell when a bull gored him in his right thigh.

The black bull that gored him was the heaviest of the morning's six bulls from the Victoriano del Rio ranch weighing around 600 kilograms.

A Spanish man was also gored in the 
'encierro', where runners in red scarves and white outfits dash through 
the Spanish town's streets pursued by the huge animals.

The
 Spaniard, a 35-year-old man from Valencia, was gored in the chest and 
taken to hospital in a semi-conscious state, officials said.

The two men are in a serious condition, the regional government said.Â

Several thousand people, many dressed in the traditional white with red neckerchiefs, took part in the nationally televised 8 a.m. run

In addition, a 35-year-old Spaniard with the initials J.R.P was in serious condition after being gored in the chest, a government statement said

Three other Spaniards who fell during the run were being treated in Pamplona hospitals for their injuries

'Buffalo' Bill Hillmann, who contributed the chapters on how to run, is described by the book's editor as 'the best young English-speaking bull-runner on the streets today'.

British journalist Alexander Fiske-Harrison said Hillmann underwent surgery 'but he is doing well.'

Several
 thousand people took part in the nationally televised 8 a.m. run in which 
they race six fighting bulls and accompanying steer along a 930-yard 
(850-metre) course from a holding pen to Pamplona's bull ring.

A
 further three men, all Spanish, were taken to hospital with lesser 
injuries from the chaotic stampede through the narrow streets of 
Pamplona's old town.

All the injured were men and few women take part in the run.

Tension soared when one bull became separated from the pack in the final 100 metres and tried to charge runners on all sides.

At one time the animal could be seen poking at a runner who had sought protection under a wooden barrier.

Dozens of people are injured each year in the runs, most of them in falls

Wednesday's
 run was the third in the week-long San Fermin festival which was 
famously depicted in Ernest Hemingway's 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises.

Hemingway aficionado Hillmann travels to Pamplona every year to take part in the festival.

There have been 14 fatalities over the past century at the fiesta, which dates to the 13th century.

A 27-year-old man from Madrid was the last person to be killed during the bull run after being gored in the neck in 2009.

The bulls are invariably killed in afternoon bullfights
