Millions of children around the world are looking forward to getting a visit from Santa tomorrow night.

But a recently unearthed historical document suggests that they may be disappointed - because Father Christmas actually died 450 years ago.

The archive lists 'Father Christmas' as the name of a man buried in an Essex churchyard in May 1564.

Record: This historical archive shows that 'Father Christmas' was buried in Dedham, Essex in 1564

Discovery: The record was contained in a book showing all of the people buried in Dedham

The amusing note was discovered at the Essex Records Office in Chelmsford as researchers were looking up reports of people who had died in the early modern period.

It is an extract from the burial record from the village of Dedham, dating to May 30, 1564.

The entry reads in full: 'The 30th Day, Father Christmas was buried.'

The exact identity of the dead man is not known, but he is likely to have been someone with the surname Christmas who was known as 'father' as a sign of respect for his advanced age.

'Christmas was not an uncommon surname in this area around that time,' a spokesman for the records office said.

Resting place: The man, apparently an elderly person with the surname 'Christmas', was buried in Dedham

Found: The remarkable archive entry is contained in this book originating from the small town

'It appears with some frequency in north Essex and south Suffolk and by 1881 the name was still largely concentrated in the south-east of England.

'The title "father" is most likely the usage given in The Oxford English Dictionary as "a respectful title given to an old and venerable man".

'To live to an old age was quite an achievement for Father Christmas in 1564 - only about one half to one third of people lived to see their 16th birthday, but if you survived that long you might live to see 50 or 60.'

The surname Christmas, then spelt 'Cristemesse', was first recorded in Essex in 1185 as Roger Cristemesse appeared in court documents.

Alive and well: Father Christmas, as depicted here by Richard Attenborough in Miracle on 34th Street, continues to deliver presents to children around the world

There was a firm of bailiffs called Christmas in Colchester around the year 1500, while other people bearing that name in the 16th and 17th centuries included a carpenter, a farmer and a brewer.

These days Father Christmas is known as a figure who lives at the North Pole and brings presents to children after entering their houses through the chimney.

However, he was originally the 'bringer of spring' at the English midwinter festival, and was dressed in green.

The image of Santa as a jolly man dressed in red is linked to the Dutch Saint Nicholas - or 'Sinterklaas' - and was spread around the world with the help of Coca-Cola's branding.
