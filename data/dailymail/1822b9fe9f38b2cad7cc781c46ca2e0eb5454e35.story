She may be fast approaching her 40th 
birthday but Kate Moss's domination of the fickle fashion world 
shows no sign of abating.

After twenty stellar years dominating the industry Kate has seen her earnings triple in the past year alone.

Her total earnings as of October 2012 for the preceding year totalled £11.72 million - that's nearly three times the amount she earned in 2011.

Big earner: Kate Moss has seen her earnings triple despite being in the industry for over 20 years

The Telegraph have revealed that Moss' company, Tilly Church, posted profits of almost £8 million, according to figures filed at Companies House.

And her second company, Skate LLP, saw earnings of £3.8 million.

This was topped off by lucrative campaigns, deals and appearances such as her own range for Rimmel, her stint in the Olympics Closing Ceremony and a starring role in George Michael's music video.

The 39-year-old also fronted campaigns for Salvatore Ferragamo, Mango, Rag & Bone and Dior Addict.

The best is yet to come: This year saw her publish her own book, launch a phone accessories collection, and star in campaigns with Stuart Weitzman, Versace, Givenchy, Matchless and St Tropez

And while 2012 was a lucrative year for the model, earnings for 2013 look set to be even bigger.

In 2013 she has already published her own book, launched a mass market phone accessories collection with Carphone Warehouse and starred in campaigns with Stuart Weitzman, Versace, Givenchy, Matchless and St Tropez.

The latest figures prove that the 2005 drug scandal, where she was pictured allegedly snorting cocaine with ex-boyfriend Pete Doherty, was just a minor blip in her career

While she was immediately dropped by a number of high profile names such as H&M and Chanel as a result - later winning back the contract with the latter - she has gone on to reestablish herself a major player in the fashion industry, and is arguably bigger than ever.
