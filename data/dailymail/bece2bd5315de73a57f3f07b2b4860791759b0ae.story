President Barack Obama wants publicly funded community college available to all Americans, a sweeping proposal that would make higher education as accessible as a high school diploma to boost weak U.S. wages and skills for the modern workforce.

The initiative's price tag has yet to be revealed, and it faces a Republican Congress averse to big new spending programs. But it will likely be a centerpiece of Obama's State of the Union Address in a week and a half.

But the White House tweeted on Thursday that 'President Obama's plan could save a full-time student an average of $3,800/year in tuition.'

If all 50 states were to participate – they would have to pick up the tab for one-quarter of the tuition cost – the idea could benefit up to 9 million students, the White House officials said in a fact sheet Friday morning.

Those figures could be costly, adding up to $34 billion per year, provided Congress green-lights the proposal.

The White House crowed about a community-college access plan on Thursday and Friday, boasting that it could give 'free' education to 9 million students

President Barack Obama's Facebook video announcing the plan drew a stunning 5.7 million views in its first 18 hours

Obama was promoting the idea in a visit Friday to Pellissippi State Community College in Knoxville, Tennessee, and in a video message posted to Facebook Thursday evening. 

'Put simply, what I'd like to do is to see the first two years of community college free for everybody who is willing to work for it,' Obama said in the video, which attracted 5.7 million viewers in less than 18 hours. 

He spoke seated on the front of his desk from his office aboard Air Force One, in the midst of a three-day tour to preview the agenda he'll be outlining in his Jan. 20 in the State of the Union address.

'It's something that we can accomplish, and it's something that will train our work force so that we can compete with anybody in the world,' Obama said.

Administration officials on a conference call with reporters Thursday evening said the funding details would come out later with the president's budget next month.

Students would qualify if they attend at least half-time, maintain a 2.5 GPA and make progress toward completing a degree or certificate program. Participating schools would have to meet certain academic requirements.

The idea got a chilly response from House Speaker John Boehner's office. 'With no details or information on the cost, this seems more like a talking point than a plan,' said spokesman Cory Fritz.

In his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama proposed universal preschool, which Congress did not take up because of cost. Obama policy adviser Cecilia Munoz pointed out that even without federal action, many states are taking up the idea and expanding preschool.

And she pointed out that a Republican – Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam – last year signed into law a pioneering scholarship program that provides free community and technical college tuition for two years. 

It has drawn 58,000 applicants, almost 90 percent of the state's high school seniors. Munoz said Obama's proposal was inspired by the popular Tennessee plan and a similar program in Chicago.

Tennessee Republican Rep. Diane Black said her state's plan, called Tennessee Promise, is paid mostly with lottery funds, while the federal funding source for Obama's plan is unclear and states will have to pay something.

'Ultimately, any efforts to reboot Tennessee Promise as a one-size-fits-all nationwide approach will be met with heavy skepticism from Congress,' Black said.

President Barack Obama spoke at Central High School, on Thursday in Phoenix about the recovering housing sector; he will address his community college plan Friday in Tennessee

Tennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, a former education secretary who is set to take over the Senate committee that oversees education, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

But he planned to join Obama Friday aboard Air Force One, along with fellow Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker.

Obama was being joined on the Tennessee visit by Vice President Joe Biden.

They also planned to visit a manufacturing facility, Techmer PM in Clinton, Tennessee, to promote a second proposal to create a fund to help low-wage workers with high potential get training in growing fields like energy, information technology and advanced manufacturing.
