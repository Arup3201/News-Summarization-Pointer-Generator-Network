The hotly-anticipated Fifty Shades Of Grey film may not have got critics hot under the collar - but that hasn't stopped fans camping out in the freezing cold ahead of the UK premiere.

The big-screen adaptation of EL James' erotic romance novel will screen in Leicester Square tonight. 

Die-hard enthusiasts slept out overnight with others arriving before sunrise, hoping to be first in the queue to catch a glimpse of the stars - despite some reviewers describing the film as a 'spanking great bore'.

After endless hype, excitement hit fever pitch at the film's world premiere in Berlin last night, as screaming fans scrambled to get a selfie on the red carpet with stars Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, who play Christian Grey and his lover Anastasia Steele.

The film is also  expected to be a hit at the box office, with more than £1 million in ticket sales a week before it opens.

Excited crowds have already gathered ahead of this evening as the film premieres in the UK at the Odeon Leicester Square in central London. 

But it has failed to get critics hot under the collar. 

Most scathing was Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian, who gave it one star, describing the film as 'the most tasteful and softcore depiction of sadomasochism in cinema history' and branding the performances of its two main stars as 'strictly daytime soap'.

Tim Robey, in the Telegraph, was more positive, awarding it four stars.

The erotic thriller, written by British author E L James, became a phenomenon on its release in 2011, spawning two sequels Fifty Shades Darker and 50 Shades Freed in 2012

'So how has it all worked out? Almost shockingly well, considering. It proves that age-old saw that great books rarely make great films, whereas barely literate junk can turn into something ripe and even electric on screen,' he said.

'The lead performances and sleek style choices sell it irresistibly to the target audience, but the film has the confidence to end bruisingly unresolved, with the structural equivalent of a slap in the face.'

The Daily Star's Nadine Linge also gave it four stars but warned that with only three sex scenes 'viewers might feel short-changed'.

'Definitely a film for women. It might be released in time for Valentine's Day but leave the men at home. Go see it for a giggle and a swoon with the girls,' she wrote.

David Edwards in the Daily Mirror opted to give it three stars, saying: 'It may not be the raciest film ever made but it's a classy and titillating adult drama, more steamy than scandalising.'

Critics have slammed Fifty Shades of Grey calling the film 'bleak' and criticising Jamie Dornan's performance as Christian Grey

Director Sam Taylor-Johnson and author EL James hit the red carpet in Berlin last night, Taylor-Johnson has said she is not reading any criticism

'Like porn for people who shop at Marks & Spencer,' he added.

The Daily Mail's Jan Moir called it a 'spanking great bore', while Kaleem Aftab in the Independent attacked the 'clumsy stereotyping' and 'plotting that would have seemed light in a teen romance'.

The Sun's Emma Brankin also picked out the lack of sex scenes, saying 'we only get a measly 11 minutes of sex' and saying the film 'takes itself way too seriously'.

And Kate Muir, in the Times, said while the actors 'make a decent stab at their somewhat thinly written characters' the adaptation 'starts out hilarious, becomes ludicrous and is finally dubious'. 

Disappointment? Some critics have pointed out that there are no shots of genitalia in the film 

Such is the expectation surrounding the film that firefighters in London have said they fear a rise in call-outs over people getting trapped in compromising situations as a result of the 'Fifty Shades' effect.

A leaked memo from DIY store B&Q said staff have been asked to prepare for an increase in demand for rope, cable ties and tape.

It was later revealed to be a ruse by the firm’s PR team.

A B&Q spokeswoman told the Guardian: 'We can confirm that the leaked memo was indeed a bit of fun. 

'Both B&Q, the public and the media have been entertained over the past few days and we are looking forward to a big weekend. We would have confessed to this sooner, but our hands were tied.'
