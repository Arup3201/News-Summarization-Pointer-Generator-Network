Prince George is enjoying his first foreign holiday after flying out with his mother the Duchess of Cambridge

Prince George is enjoying his first foreign holiday after flying out with his mother the Duchess of Cambridge to the Caribbean.

Kate and her son joined the rest of the Middleton clan on their annual jaunt to the isle of Mustique, leaving her husband Prince William studying in Cambridge.

Six-month-old George travelled with the family and three royal bodyguards on a scheduled 747 Jumbo jet last weekend and was said to have behaved impeccably during the 8,500-mile flight. 

The party includes Kate’s parents Michael and Carole, sister Pippa and brother James.

The
 Middletons normally stay in a £19,000-a-week villa on the exclusive 
private island which was made famous when the Queen’s sister Princess 
Margaret was given a holiday home there.

It
 boasts just 74 luxury villas – owned by stars including Mick Jagger – 
and one small hotel and is patrolled by security guards both on and 
offshore.

Last year, however, paparazzi 
photographers managed to photograph four-months pregnant Kate displaying
 her small baby bump as she strolled along a beach accompanied by her 
husband.

Despite Palace 
officials claiming it was a ‘clear breach’ of her privacy, the pictures 
were subsequently sold to a downmarket Italian magazine.

Sources
 confirmed last night that Prince William has opted out of the holiday 
this year as he is on a ten-week course at Cambridge University studying
 agricultural management.

He will be reunited with his wife and son towards the end of next week when they return to Britain in time for the Duchess to undertake her first official engagement of the year at the National  Portrait Gallery in London on February 11.

Tour: Prince William is at home in England studying while Kate is on holiday

The Caribbean holiday was designed to coincide with granny Carole Middleton’s 59th birthday yesterday.

George, who is third in line to the throne, will have to get used to extensive long-haul travel.

In April he is due to accompany his parents on his first royal tour to Australia and New Zealand.

By the time he is nine months old he will have already travelled some 40,000 miles.
