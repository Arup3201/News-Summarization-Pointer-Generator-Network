There was a hum of mutinous muttering as they trooped out of the Emirates on Saturday night. No strident protest, no outright rebellion, nothing so crude; but the frustration, the discontent were all too evident.

It was best expressed at Arsene Wenger’s press conference, when an earnest scribbler began: ‘Arsene: dominating teams and not finishing them off. Is it a case of deja vu?’ A pause: ‘Of course, you’ll know what that means.’

For half a second, the manager’s post-match face hovered on the brink of a smile. But the summary had been perfectly accurate. Having fashioned sufficient chances in the first 25 minutes to have won half a dozen matches, Arsenal frittered them one by one. The Emirates sensed a penalty would be paid, and they were right.

United were second best at pretty well everything, save the one virtue which counts for more than all the others. Wayne Rooney demonstrated it to clinical perfection. Rooney spent 85 minutes watching some of the most expensive attackers in English football miss chance upon chance. 

Then, with United breaking at pace and the Arsenal defence suicidally stretched, he accelerated on to a pass, changed from foot to foot, and raised a delicate chip beyond the goalkeeper. As lessons go, it was utterly emphatic.

Yet Rooney knew, Arsenal knew, everybody in this part of North London knew that Arsenal should have been home and hosed before United had even raised their voice. 

But the chest-thumping chants of United’s travelling circus told their own story. United were installed in the top four, while what might have been a night of solid Arsenal advancement became a slow decline into upper mid-table.

Louis van Gaal was another manager who almost cracked a smile; with good reason. But United’s manager is a serious man, who delivers his messages with the controlled frenzy of a revivalist preacher. Random words are barked in mid-sentence, startling the sleepy with their passion: ‘When we KEEP! The ball, when we SHOW! Confidence, then we create big chances,’ he boomed. One imagines he might be a revelation at half-time. But he was honest enough to admit: ‘If Arsenal had scored in the first 20 minutes, then it is another game.’

We went into the match aware that both clubs have known better days. Time was when they debated the glittering prizes, now they tend to know their place; a couple of dowagers, squabbling over the dinner service while the men with new money make off with the deeds to the castle.

Attacking talent fairly flooded the field; Danny Welbeck, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere on one side, Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria on the other. But, by comparison, the defences were accidents waiting to happen.

Arsenal have long toiled to accommodate their suspect central defenders, but United’s injury list has pushed players like Paddy McNair and Tyler Blackett into situations which ideally would have been long delayed.

As they struggled through those early anxieties, Van Gaal sat in his dugout, looking inscrutable. The assumption used to be that he was thinking profound thoughts. Now, nobody is quite so sure. But, as he would later point out, the result is the starting point of all the inquests.

Arsenal were dazzling in that early passage. Their pace was bewildering, their passing inspired, and all the doubts which United’s defenders were clearly nourishing came crowding remorselessly in. Oxlade-Chamberlain was virtually unplayable. 

But the finishing; ah, the finishing! Welbeck was profligate, Oxlade-Chamberlain careless, while Wilshere treated his chances with the extravagance of a lottery winner in a casino. And as they wasted chance upon chance, United sensed that there were points of their own to be made.

After half an hour, the match produced a revealing cameo. With a scrappy challenge, Wilshere provoked a sadly unequal spat with Marouane Fellaini. As the United player reacted, Wilshere thrust his head towards his opponent’s face, twice. Had the big man been in theatrical mood, then Arsenal would unquestionably, and needlessly, have been reduced to 10.

Wilshere brings many qualities to this team, but there is a truculent self-indulgence which threatens to prevent his becoming the kind of player he ought to be. By now, Rooney was more influential, Fellaini was an imposing target, while Di Maria cannot be subdued for half a match. 

You could almost touch the apprehension and Wilshere’s departure increased that tension. He made a truly forlorn spectacle as he limped away, and you wondered how his team would cope without his creativity.

Within a minute, the first United goal provided the answer. We sensed it would not be Arsenal’s night, and they started to play as if they knew it. The chance still cropped up, but there was an absence of conviction, optimism, all those qualities which teams at the top tend to take for granted.

As United flourished, Arsenal feared there was even worse ahead. And they were absolutely right.
