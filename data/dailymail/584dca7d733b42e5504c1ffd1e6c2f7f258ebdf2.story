It's been described as 'the best one bedroom apartment' currently on the market in Britain and with a hefty price tag of £2.65million any prospective buyers will certainly have high expectations.

The raised ground floor flat in Chelsea comes with a 560 sq ft drawing room complete with ornate high ceilings, a grand fireplace and a large bay window.

In the kitchen is a floor to ceiling American-style fridge while in the luxury bathroom one wall comprises of a huge mirror. Despite having a second smaller bathroom the flat only has one average-sized double bedroom.

Grand: The one-bedroom period apartment in Chelsea, London, has detailed high ceilings, a traditional fireplace and a large bay window

Average: The apartment may be luxury and come with a hefty £2.65million price tag but in fact only has one average-sized double bedroom

Perhaps the biggest selling point is that the back doors open up onto the award-winning Wetherby Gardens - a private open space shared by the residents. 

The plot of land was established in the mid to late 19th century on land which had previously been a market garden owned by the Gunter Estate.

The garden is around the size of a football field and is filled with a variety of plants, flowers and imposing trees along with large areas of well-maintained lawns.

Chelsea estate agency Russell Simpson is marketing the apartment with the seller asking for £2.65 million, which would pay for a sizeable country home with land in the Cotswolds, however, in Chelsea it only gets you 1,161 sq ft.

Industrial: The kitchen, which leads out into the gardens, has a floor to ceiling American-style fridge and sleek black gloss worktops

Exclusive: The luxury flat opens up onto the award-winning Wetherby Gardens - a huge private open space shared by the residents

In keeping: The ground-floor flat, in the borough of Chelsea and Kensington, features a traditional frontage, with ornate pillars and steps

Jake Russell, director at Russell Simpson, said: 'This delightful home is unique to central London in the fact that it has the increasingly rare option of direct access from the back door.

'You just need to walk down the steps and you're straight into this huge garden square. What is also great about Wetherby Gardens is that dogs are in the vast green space, making this home perfect for those with pets.

'It is not often in London you can boast a garden, albeit shared among a few lucky others, a garden of this size, making this home the envy of many.

'This flat also has a drawing room that could belong to a £50 million mansion in The Boltons.' 

Stately: Though narrow the bathroom has been decorated with modern tiles and fittings and one wall comprises entirely of a huge mirror

Artistic: The apartment has huge pieces of work on the walls and the wooden floored hallways lead to the bedroom, kitchen and bathrooms

Picturesque: A few steps down from the back door and the new buyer will be led into the communal Wetherby Gardens in Chelsea
