After crashing out of the Champions League and then losing 3-0 at arch-rivals Manchester United, it's been a week to forget for Liverpool.

The Reds' last two matches have been a microcosm of their season so far.

After playing a brand of swashbuckling football that saw them close to winning the title last season, Brendan Rodgers' side now look devoid of ideas and lacking in a killer instinct up front.

Sportsmail's Dominic King assesses where (and why) things have gone so wrong at Anfield this campaign.

1. What is the minimum Liverpool must achieve this season?

The expectation from Fenway Sports Group back in the summer was to retain their place in the top four and secure another adventure in the Champions League. No matter how bad the team's form has been, there will not be reassessing of goals from FSG. They have to get back in the Champions League and whether they do it by finishing in the top four - or winning the Europa League - is immaterial.

2. Will they take the Europa League seriously? And can they realistic compete on two fronts (Thursdays and Sundays)?

For reasons outlined above, they cannot doing anything other than take it seriously. It might actually be their best chance of qualifying for the Champions League, plus winning a European trophy would be a positive for their reputation. They have the numbers to compete with a Thursday-Sunday schedule but whether they have the quality is another matter entirely.

3. Who had final say on signing the players Liverpool bought in the summer?

The manager. For all the talk of the transfer committee, the policy Liverpool follow and their preference for buying young, unproven talent, the buck always stops with Rodgers.

He might have different ideas sometimes to those on the committee on certain players - the other members are Michael Edwards (head of analysis), Dave Fallows (head of scouting), Barry Hunter (chief scout), Ian Ayre (chief executive) and Mike Gordon (FSG board member). But he doesn't have players imposed on him.

This is what he said on May 28 earlier this year. 'We will never bring in a player here who the manager doesn’t want in. That’s a great credit to the owners and the other people at the club. We work very closely together – it’s worth stressing that. It’s key that we are very much one club.'

4. Why does Rodgers think Raheem Sterling can play centre forward?

Sterling has speed and scored 10 goals last season. He was also prolific during his time as an academy player and on the opening day of the season, he actually combined well against Southampton, scoring the opening goal of the campaign from a central position.

On that day, remember, it was being said that he and Daniel Sturridge could form a new 'SAS' partnership. 

Sterling had a bad day in front of goal against Manchester United. If had taken his opportunities - which he should have done - Rodgers decision to deploy him in that role would have been vindicated.

5. How embarrassing are the purchases of Mario Balotelli and Dejan Lovren?

Nobody was saying Lovren was an embarrassing purchase in July when he arrived for £20m but his start has been a calamity. 

He looks an accident waiting to happen every time he goes on the pitch and Rodgers' assertion that Lovren was the natural replacement for Jamie Carragher looks hopelessly misguided at present. As for Balotelli, Liverpool actually improved when he came on at Old Trafford but what you see with him is what you get.

He isn't a 20 goal-a-season man, he isn't someone who will set the tone with relentless working and he is always liable to command a negative headline. The experiment needs to be ended sooner rather than later but which club would take him?

6. Which players do LFC need to buy in January?

They need a goalkeeper, a top-class central midfielder and a striker. In an ideal world, Petr Cech would be the keeper but Chelsea are reluctant to do business with Liverpool any longer in the transfer market.

He is also 32, which would be a negative in terms of his possible recruitment. Liverpool have a striker, Divock Origi, on loan at Lille but there is little chance of him arriving at Anfield next month. It would also be unfair to expect an untried 19-year-old (who is currently struggling himself in France) to transform the season.

7. Are funds available… and will Rodgers be trusted to spend it?

There isn't a great deal of money available but they could be creative by raising funds by, say, selling Fabio Borini. A more pertinent question is, which players would want to come in January with Liverpool's form being so wretched?

8. How bad are the dressing room issues?

Liverpool have just been knocked out of the Champions League, they have no chance of winning the Barclays Premier League and their form has been awful - no dressing room in the world would be happy given those circumstances. 

There has been huge change in recent months in terms of personnel and the spirit of last season has not yet been recreated. Perhaps they need a night out to clear their heads but, at the minute, there is no opportunity in the calendar. The amount of games they are playing is relentless.

9. Will Steven Gerrard stay?

Still too early to answer that question. Gerrard will make his decision in his own time. If he stays at Liverpool, it will because he believes he can still contribute next season.

10. Is John Henry’s trigger finger twitching?

Henry remains the most well known of Liverpool's owners but he is not as hands on as he used to be. He has only tweeted twice about football matters since March 30 - once was to commend a victory over Tottenham, the other was a picture of Liverpool fans in Boston on July 23 - and the key FSG figures are Tom Werner, Liverpool's chairman, and the influential Mike Gordon, who is most involved in day-to-day business. 

FSG have faith in Rodgers and they will back him because he is their man. They are an organisation, though, that will not shirk away from making decisions and Rodgers knows he must turn things around. Patience is not limitless when results are bad and money is at stake.
