A jilted boyfriend who broke into his ex-girlfriend's flat and set it on fire in a bid to kill himself has been jailed.

Dillon Irwin, 20, forced his way into former girlfriend Samantha Milliken's home in Burnley, Lancashire, through a skylight and threatened her with violence before she fled in terror.

He then set about wrecking the flat before starting a fire and barricading himself in as a newborn baby slept next door.

Irwin was only saved when police forced their way into the burning property and found him unconscious on a landing before carrying him to safety.

Later when questioned he claimed he was drunk and wanted to kill himself and didn't know how he had started the fire.

Although nobody was killed in the blaze it killed Miss Milliken's cat, leaving her distraught.

At Burnley Crown Court yesterday, Irwin of Burnley, admitted arson, being reckless as to whether life was endangered and was jailed for four years and eight months,

Prosecutor Joseph Allman told the court that Miss Milliken was the proprietor of Posh Paws Tattoos in the town and had rented the flat above.

On July 14 or 15 of this year, Irwin called Miss Milliken wanting to borrow her keys to go into her flat, but she refused to give them to him.

The court heard that Irwin, pictured, gained access to Miss Milliken's flat through a skylight window and threatened her before wrecking the property 

He then called her a short time later telling her that he had managed to get inside the property.

Miss Milliken then called a friend asking them to go and remove Irwin from her flat, after he had gained access through a skylight window, which he broke.

The court heard it was unclear if Irwin was taken out by the friend or left of his own accord.

He then texted Miss Milliken saying he loved her but she replied saying she wanted to move on and she deleted him from her Facebook profile.

However, in the early hours of July 19, Irwin then text Miss Milliken again at 5am when she was in bed, saying that he loved her and that he was on his way to the flat.

She replied telling him not to come but shortly after, he arrived banging on the front door.

The court was told how Miss Milliken knew he was drunk, so she told him she was calling his mother to collect him.

Irwin then started climbing towards the roof, while Miss Milliken ran upstairs towards the boarded-up skylight,

The 20-year-old then took the boarding off the window and threatened the victim before he gained access to the property and began to chase her.

Miss Milliken then locked a steel gate at the bottom of the stairs to stop Irwin from following her but he tried to shake it open.

The court was then told that at that point, the defendant's mother arrived at the flat, which prompted him to throw a television on the floor.

The two women then retreated outside and then watched as he then threw a kitchen unit through a second floor window and then climbed down a drainpipe.

Miss Miliken and Irwin's mother then went to wait inside a car before the defendant picked up a brick and hurled it at the car and banged on the bonnet.

His mother then called the police as Irwin ran back into the flat.

Soon after, smoke could be seen coming out of an open second floor bedroom window.

Mr Allman told the hearing that by the time officers arrived at the flat, Irwin had barricaded himself in by stacking furniture behind a secure gate.

A police officer then entered the flat using a ladder then used an fire extinguisher to put out a burning sofa.

At the same time, another officer managed to breach the barricade and ran up the stairs where they found Irwin collapsed on the floor.

At Burnley Crown Court, pictured, Irwin was sentenced to four years and eight months in prison after admitting arson and endangering life 

He was then dragged from the property by several other officers.

Mr Allman said the fire brigade then arrived and put out the blaze and the defendant was taken to hospital to be treated for the effects of smoke inhalation.

He explained: 'Officers were banging on doors of neighbouring houses until all of the occupants had been accounted for. A couple with a newborn baby emerged from an adjoining flat.

Mr Allman added the second floor of the flat, owned by a single mother, was extensively damaged, to the tune of about £30,000.

The prosecutor continued: 'The defendant had little recollection. He said he had been drinking in Burnley town centre. He admitted going into the flat. He said he wanted to kill himself and he didn’t recall how he started the fire.'
