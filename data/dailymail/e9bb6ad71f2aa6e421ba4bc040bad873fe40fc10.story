Floyd Mayweather has selected Bolton as one of the six venues on the England leg of his world tour, leading to fevered speculation that a match-up with Amir Khan could soon be on the cards.

Bolton is, of course, the home town of Khan, and the American's announcement does suggest that any potential fight is moving closer to fruition.

Mayweather, widely heralded as the best boxer on the planet, will top the bill at a sportsman's dinner held at the Reebok Stadium - the home of Bolton Wanderers - on Monday 23 June.

 Brown, the British businessman responsible for making the deal to

event as well.

'Floyd
 Mayweather Jnr is going to walk into a building with his “Money Team” 
in Amir Khan’s back yard...I have to pinch myself that he’s really 
coming over here.

'It’s the stuff legends are made of.'

Khan and Mayweather were both in action last Saturday night in Las Vegas, winning their fights against American Luis Collazo and the Argentine Marcos Maidana respectively.
