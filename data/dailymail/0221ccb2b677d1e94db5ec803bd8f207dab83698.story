It's not often there is a centenarian in the family, least of all two. Yet identical sisters Marjorie Gilbert and Winifred Witt are celebrating a century together today as they both turn 100 years old.

Marjorie Gilbert and Winifred Witt from Cwmbran, South Wales, are thought to be among just fifteen sets of twins in the world who have both turned 100, and fewer again who are identical.

Identical twins Marjorie Gilbert (R) and Winifred Whitt celebrate their 100th birthday today in Cwmbran, Wales. They are thought to be Wales' oldest twins

Marjorie and Winifred, who live in a nursing home, are known as 'the Twins' and do everything together.

Winifred’s son Nolan Witt said: 'They are inseparable - it has always been that way, from the day they were born, to the day they will die.

'There were times when we didn’t know which one was which, even as their children. I’m sure there were some boyfriends along the way who were the same.'

The pair were born in 1913, and through their childhood they shared clothes, books and even a bed.Marjorie’s
daughter, Ann Eccleshare, said: 'I remember my Auntie Win saying to me 
she cried herself to sleep the night Marjorie got married, because that 
was the first night she had ever slept alone. It’s lovely the way they 
have grown old so happily and sweet-natured together.'

Together forever: the twins aged just six months (left, with Marjorie on the left) and aged 81 (Marjorie on right)

Both sisters married aged 21 but they were determined not to live apart and so they moved both their families into one house in Pontrhydyrun, South Wales, during the war.

They had four children each, with nine grandchildren on Winifred’s side, and eight on Marjorie’s side. They have 14 great grandchildren each, while Winifred has four great, great grandchildren and Marjorie has two.

After their husbands had both died, in 1992, they began living together once more and they would play bingo together every Saturday at the Mecca, Cwmbran, until they were 95.

Nolan said: 'They have had two families their whole lives. We think that when one dies, the other will follow too. You can’t have one without the other, they come as a pair.'

Ann said: 'It was like having two mums for us children. You would buy the same Christmas and birthday presents for them both. They were never different.'

Gwyneth Virgo, manager of the nursing home they share, said: 'They are real characters the two of them. They come alive at night. They sleep all day and then 7.30pm comes and bang, they are bickering away. It’s comical.

'We are going to make a big fuss of them for their birthday. We’ve got cakes, flowers, balloons - the lot.'
