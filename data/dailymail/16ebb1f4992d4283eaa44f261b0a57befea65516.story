Her willingness to replicate Sharon Stone’s infamous Basic Instinct pose suggests that Lindsey Vonn is not one to shy away from controversy. 

But if you were left in any doubt, the revelation that the Olympic gold medallist is dating disgraced golfer Tiger Woods ought to remove it once and for all.

The pair this week released a portrait that confirmed America’s most successful skier has teamed up with its most successful golfer – and, arguably, worst husband.

While the world recoils from the shock that any woman could countenance a relationship with a man who cheated on ex-wife Elin Nordegren 120 times, insiders are stressing this is not a case of déjà vu.

For while 28-year-old Vonn may resemble Nordegren with her blonde hair and platinum smile, the two could not be more different.

Nordegren is aloof, with an interest in European politics and a loathing for media attention, while Tiger’s new birdie has quite a reputation as the glamour girl and the joker of the Alpine skiing circuit.

She’s also no stranger to racy photoshoots and glossy endorsements, having posed for Sports Illustrated magazine’s swimwear issue.

Two years ago, she recreated Stone’s Basic Instinct pose for a magazine – albeit in a slightly more modest manner than in the film.

So what are the prospects for the newly minted pair?

They are both divorced – Lindsey’s marriage to ski coach Thomas Vonn ended in November 2011 – both wealthy, and both child prodigies turned world champions.

Indeed, one commentator observed that only someone with Vonn’s competitive spirit would dare to take on a boyfriend with such a scandal-soaked track record.

The pairing may come as a surprise to many as American tabloids had been speculating that Woods was desperate to win back Nordegren, who received almost £73million in their 2010 divorce.

In reality, the couple have gradually forged separate lives, and she is said to be casually dating billionaire coal magnate Chris Cline, 55.

Woods met Vonn at a charity event last April. He refused to confirm the liaison when she was spotted on the slopes in Vail in November coaching his two children.

But in February their romance became public knowledge when he sent his private jet to bring her back to America after she suffered a knee injury in a bad fall at the Alpine Ski World Championships.

On Monday, they issued separate statements and portrait photos to confirm that they are dating.

‘I guess it wasn’t a well-kept secret but yes, I am dating Tiger Woods,’ Vonn wrote on her Facebook page.

‘Our relationship evolved from a friendship into something more over these past few months and it has made me very happy.’

Woods added that they plan to continue their relationship privately as an ‘ordinary couple’.

Vonn, who is originally from Minnesota, strapped on her first skis aged two and competed at her first Olympics aged 17.

She won silver and gold at the 2010 winter Olympics in Vancouver and is now training for the 2014 event.
