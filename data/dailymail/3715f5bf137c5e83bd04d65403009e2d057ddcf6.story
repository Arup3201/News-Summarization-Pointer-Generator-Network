Some bottles of brandy have labels saying ‘specially matured for 40 years’. 

They should slap one on Sir John Chilcot’s backside. This mumbling, most untheatrical of men has been creeping down Whitehall’s penumbral corridors since 1963. 

The Civil Service recruiters chose well. He is opacity and caution made flesh, a right tiptoeing Terry.

Sir John, 75, appeared before the Foreign Affairs select committee to discuss the delays to his Iraq inquiry. Clear explanation came there none.

Sir John Chilcot told MPs it was 'really not possible to say' when he will publish his long-awaited report

Come, come, you weren’t expecting anything blunt or startlingly open, were you? The man’s a former Permanent Secretary. But at least he turned up on time. He might easily have wandered in four years late.

He was halting in a Sir Humphreyesque way, inserting delay-coughs and creaky erms and aahs into his answers.

He made little jokes about how he did not want to use ‘mandarin language’ (not that this stopped him). He was treated by the committee with such care, they could have been carrying brimful bowls of soup across a tightrope.

Was this really the sort of dynamo who should have been entrusted with a £10million investigation into how we were hauled to war by the Blair regime? He looked more like a grandad about to audition for a Werther’s Original advert.

With a good-old-boy judder of the jowls, he amiably took his seat and started to read an opening statement. It was so windy that even the committee’s Establishment-chummy chairman, Sir Richard Ottaway (Con, Croydon S), lost patience.

There was, however, sad news to start: Sir John disclosed that one of his inquiry panel members, historian Sir Martin Gilbert, had died on Tuesday night. That took the oompf out of proceedings for a while.

But let us remember what is at hand here. Hundreds of our soldiers died in Iraq. Thousands of Iraqi civilians were killed. The war may have been one of the worst scandals in British politics for a century. Is the delay to this inquiry not scandalous?

Sir John said mildly that he ‘recognised parliamentary and public interest in our progress’. Well, that was big of him. He told us a tiny bit about the ‘Maxwellisation’ process, the name Whitehall gives to the practice of letting anyone criticised by an inquiry have advance sight of the relevant passages (this creates jobs for lawyers). But, oh, the coyness, the secrecy, the reluctance to give frank answers.

The former top civil servant was hauled before Parliament to explain why his report will not be published before the general election

He referred to the ‘Maxwell-ees’ but would not say how many of them there were. Why the hell not? It completely eludes me – baffles me, makes me boil like hot jam – why such a statistic should not be public information. In the United States they would be flabbergasted by such official secrecy.

Sir John’s lips formed a little moue. He toyed with the committee, going all playful and cryptic. And the committee accepted his stonewalling. The flaccid Ottaway, with admiration, observed his failure to give a straight answer and said: ‘I’m sure you’re thoroughly enjoying yourself.’ 

Sir John: ‘I’m grateful.’ He was asked if Cabinet Secretary and ex-Blair groupie Sir Jeremy Heywood had kept his snout out of the inquiry. ‘I’ve no reason to think otherwise,’ he said quietly. 

Interesting formulation of words. A cynic might say that that was Whitehall-speak for ‘of course he didn’t’. Negotiations with Sir Jeremy’s officials had been ‘a very long, difficult and challenging discussion on both sides’. Translation: screaming rows?

Have you noticed how everyone in this sketch has a knighthood? Tory ancient Sir John Stanley ambled into proceedings and put some questions to Chilcot. They called each other ‘Sir John’ like a couple of stalemated chess players.

Throughout his answers, Chilcot gave as little as possible. He was as spare and watery as supermarket ham, fastidious about rules, genuflecting to precedent. Public opinion? Public outrage? Please. Don’t let’s be vulgar.

As he left the parliamentary estate in a smoke-glassed car, he was saluted by a policeman. How tolerant, how tame we are.
