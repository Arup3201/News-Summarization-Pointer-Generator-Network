Disgraced: Molly Shattuck, 47, was indicted on Monday on two counts of third-degree rape, four counts of unlawful sexual contact and three counts of providing alcohol to minors

The inappropriate sexual relationship between Molly Shattuck, the 47-year-old former Baltimore Ravens cheerleader, and a 15-year-old boy which has lead to the mother-of-three being charged with third-degree rape was  instigated by her own son, police have revealed.

According to Delaware State Police, it was one of Shattuck’s own children who urged the unnamed victim to text his mom because ‘she is obsessed with you’ after spotting photos of the teen on Instagram.

Disgraced Shattuck was indicted on Monday on two counts of third-degree rape, four counts of unlawful sexual contact and three counts of providing alcohol to minors. 

She was released on $84,000 bond after an arraignment on Wednesday at Sussex County Superior Court in Georgetown, Delaware.

The ill-feted relationship had begun at the end of May when Shattuck - the estranged wife of billionaire businessman Mayo Shattuck III - commented on a photo of the teen on Instagram.

The victim replied with a private message of thanks, but Shattuck's son then forwarded his mother's cell phone number, saying, ‘You should text my Mom, she is obsessed with you,’ according to court records. 

The pair first met a month later while the teen was visiting a friend in her neighborhood, reports DelawareOnline.

The meeting ended with a hug but no other physical contact between the 47-year-old mom and 15-year-old boy, court records said.

Things soon moved up a gear as the pair started to meet for regular private trysts in Shattuck’s Cadillac Escalade. Court records show that a meeting at an AMC movie theater followed by another in a school parking lot.

During July, Shattuck picked the teenager up from summer school ‘five or six times’ at lunchtime and they would ‘talk and eat and then get in the back of the car and kiss or make out,’ police said.

It was during one of these incidents that Shattuck allegedly touched the teenager's penis.

‘Between their encounters, Shattuck asked for pictures via text message’ and he would send pictures of himself shirtless and one in his underwear, the victim told police.
