Multiple people were injured when a boat slammed into a pier on Liberty Island Tuesday afternoon.

Conflicting reports say anywhere between three and nine people were injured when a New Jersey-based tour boat made a hard landing just before 4pm at the Statue of Liberty. The extent of the damage to both the boat and pier is not yet known.

The Miss New Jersey was carrying 497 passengers and nine crew, reports said.

Witnesses told WABC that people hit the deck when the ferry hit the dock, none went overboard and all injuries appeared to be minor.

Three crew were injured, according to NBC New York, they refused medical attention. WPIX is reporting that nine passengers were injured, none seriously. A US Park Police spokesperson was unable to confirm how many people sustained injuries or to what extent they were injured.

The cause of the accident is unclear, according to CBS New York. The vessel did not take on water, nor did it leak fuel into the harbor, the station added. The weather was warm and sunny, with temperatures in the mid-80s, ruling out weather as a cause for the crash.

A quick inspection resulted in the boat being cleared to return to its home dock, another boat was sent to pick up the passengers. The ferry company could not be reached by MailOnline for further comment.

Crew members will be tested for drugs and alcohol and the boat will be inspected for mechanical problems, CBS New York reported.

Ferry service to and from Liberty Island was suspended for about 15 minutes, but has since resumed without delays, according to WABC.

The Statue of Liberty reopened July 4 after being closed since sustaining damage during Hurricane Sandy last year.
