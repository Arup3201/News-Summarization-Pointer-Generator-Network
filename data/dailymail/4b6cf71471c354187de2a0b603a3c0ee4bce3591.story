A family firm which made iconic sheepskin coats for Del Boy and footballer commentator John 'Motty' Motson is closing down tomorrow after 169 years because of falling sales.

Nursey and Son, based in Bungay, Suffolk, has also sold coats to Eric Clapton and ITV presenter Holly Willoughby over the years and is one of the UK's oldest sheepskin specialists.

Actor David Jason, who played Del Boy Trotter in the classic BBC comedy Only Fools and Horses, even had one specially made after falling in love with the coat he wore on screen.

But the company, which has been making luxurious garments since 1846, was forced to shut last March after plummeting profits and falling sales plunged it into crisis.

It has been run by the same family for generations and employed more than 80 staff at its peak in 1970s. But recently it only employed seven people and had not made a profit in six years.

The firm reopened in October to sell off remaining stock but tomorrow marks the final day for the Victorian powerhouse.

Managing director Tim Nursey, 65, who was handed the reins in the 1970s by his father Samuel Burton Nursey, said he had battled to come to terms with closing the historic business.

'I'm fully adjusted to it now. I had to really make the decision in my own mind. It is a time of change. In our heyday we supplied hundreds of men's outfitters and ladies dress shops across Britain and northern Europe.

'Most have shut down and that filtered down to us. Fashion is changing and the weather isn't as cold as it was.'

Mr Nursey started training at the business when he was 18 and is the fifth generation of his family to run the enterprise.

'The last eight of us played football and cricket together when we were young and several people had been with us for 40 years.

'We had all been young together and we had all got older together,' said Mr Nursey.

'We knew we hadn't made a profit for five or six years. They must have looked at us and realised if they were going to overcome that and expand the business they would need a huge amount of money.'

Nursey and Son used the highest quality toscana and merino lambskin as well as Italian leather to make coats, gilets, slippers, gloves and hats alongside many other products.

Mr Nursey said he counted a visit from Princess Anne in the 1990s as one of his highlights, along with being named the Countryside Alliance's British champions in the traditional business category in 2010.

Limited stock is left and Mr Nursey said there had been some interest in selling the brand name for exclusivity in Japan.

He also aims to launch a property rental company letting warehouse and office space in the building.

'The name Nursey and Son will continue in the town hopefully for generations. People have been very kind - many were shocked and sad to see us closing,' said Mr Nursey. 

'To come to a shop where nearly everything was made on the premises is extremely rare.

'We did everything humanly possible to keep the firm going and there are some very happy memories to take away with us.'
