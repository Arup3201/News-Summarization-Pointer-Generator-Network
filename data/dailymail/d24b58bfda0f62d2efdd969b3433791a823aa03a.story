Could radar be the answer to keeping an eye on elderly people without invading their privacy?

That’s what a team of researchers at Villanova University in Pennsylvania are aiming to prove with their experiment.

They say using radar could keep track of older relatives and even detect when they fall over.

Researchers at Villanova University in Pennsylvania have developed a radar system that can detect when people move and fall. They say it could be used to keep track of elderly people and get them help if needed. Pictured is a graduate student taking part in the experiment

The system uses radar units small enough to fit in your hand.

They send electromagnetic waves into the surrounding environment.

As these waves bounce off people and objects they can monitor what is going on in the room.

The system can tell the difference between some falling and just sitting down.

If it detects a fall, it sends a signal to mobile phones or relevant people, such as relatives and emergency services.

The technology is so accurate that apparently it can also monitor the heart rate and breathing of people in the room.

And it can also pinpoint which part of the room events have happened in, so the response can be swift if needed.

However, the system is specific to the user, so it is not quite ready to be rolled out en masse yet.

The algorithms are trained to the motions of one user, but in future this could be generalised.

Right now, according to the researchers, 40 million Americans are over the age of 65, and the Census Bureau predicts that by the year 2030, 80 million Americans will be 65 or older.

Due to these rising statistics, families, communities and health care providers are at a cross-road in terms of how to best serve this growing aging population.

Many elderly individuals choose to live alone, which poses a great risk as falls and other ailments become more likely as a person ages.

In order to increase the safety and security of an elderly person living alone, researchers at Villanova University are examining the use of through-the-wall radar technology to detect falls and monitor the elderly in their individual living spaces.

Graduate 
students in the College of Engineering were trained in walking, falling,
 and functioning like an elderly person and experiments were conducted 
in the radar-imaging lab on Villanova’s campus.

Kelly
 Nestor, a clinical instructor in Villanova’s College of Nursing and an 
expert in the growing elderly population, educated and trained the 
students on how the elderly carry themselves and walk - with or without 
the assistance of canes or walkers.

The system works by bouncing radar off people and objects. It must be individually tailored to a specific user so it knows if, for example, they have a cane or other form of support. It is hoped the system can be generalised to various users in the future though

Dr
 Moeness Amin, director of the Center for Advanced Communications in the
 College of Engineering, is the Principal Investigator for the project.

His research focuses on various applications for radar imaging, including search and rescue, defence, and law enforcement.

Dr
 Amin and his team, through a grant from Qatar University, are now 
developing a series of algorithms to identify the patterns and routines 
of an elderly person in his or her home.

The radar, with the help of these algorithms, can detect when a person is sitting, standing, walking and so on.

They
 say detection of motion, and even classification of what sort of motion
 it is (such as walking or falling), can be achieved in all rooms inside
 a home with just one or a few radar units.

‘Radar has become a mature technology,’ says Dr Amin in the video.

‘Radar is becoming faster, less expensive, more compact and more reliable.

‘So people have started thinking about transitioning this technology into healthcare.

‘In the elderly care the radar looks at the human as a target, so we would like to detect the fall and locate the fall.

‘We would like to do so with respect to privacy, and also try to focus on the fact that it should be non-intrusive.’

This could be used to monitor if they fall and need help, for example
