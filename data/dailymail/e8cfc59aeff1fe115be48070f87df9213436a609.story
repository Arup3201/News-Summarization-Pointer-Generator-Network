For 24 years, Aung San Suu Kyi was either under house arrest or too fearful that if she left Myanmar, the government would never let her return.

Now, in a sign of how much life there has changed, she's back to being a world traveler.

Bangkok's towering skyscrapers and sprawling urban lights will be the opposition leader's first glimpse of the outside world when she lands Tuesday night to kick off a tour of two continents.

It's a stark contrast to the sleepy city of Yangon, where the former military regime kept her a prisoner in her own home for a total of 15 years.

Suu Kyi was to spend several days in Thailand, where she'll speak Friday at the World Economic Forum on East Asia.

She'll return to Myanmar briefly and head to Europe in mid-June, with stops including Geneva and Oslo - to formally accept the Nobel Peace Prize she won 21 years ago.

In Dublin, she'll share a stage with U2 frontman Bono, a staunch Suu Kyi supporter, at a concert in her honor, according to Irish media.

In England, she has been given the rare honor of addressing both houses of Parliament. France's Foreign Ministry says she also plans to stop in Paris.

The tour marks Suu Kyi's latest step in a stunning trajectory from housewife to political prisoner to opposition leader in Parliament, as Myanmar opens to the outside world and sheds a half century of military rule.

Meetings with world leaders are planned along the way as dignitaries line up to shake Suu Kyi's hand.

The last time the 66-year-old Nobel laureate flew abroad was a year before the Berlin Wall came down, in April 1988, when she traveled from London to Myanmar to nurse her dying mother.

Until then she had led an international lifestyle, growing up partly in India, where her mother was ambassador.

The world was a different place the last time Aung San Suu Kyi left Myanmar.

The Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union still existed.

Bangkok, the city Suu Kyi visits this week, now has towering skyscrapers, a subway and elevated rail system and slightly milder traffic jams.

Elsewhere in 1988:

She later attended Oxford, worked for the United Nations in New York and Bhutan and then married British academic Michael Aris and raised their two sons in England.

Suu Kyi returned to Myanmar just as an uprising erupted against the military regime.

As daughter of Gen. Aung San, the country's independence hero, she was thrust into the forefront of demonstrations until the military brutally crushed the protests and locked her under house arrest in 1989.

Over the next two decades she became the world's most famous political prisoner.

During intermittent periods of freedom, she declined opportunities to go abroad for fear she would not be allowed to re-enter Myanmar.

Suu Kyi's commitment to the cause came at high personal cost. In 1999, she stayed in Myanmar even as her husband was dying of cancer in England. They last saw each other in 1995, after which the junta denied Aris a visa.

After her release from house arrest in November 2010, Suu Kyi had an emotional reunion with her youngest son, Kim Aris, when the junta gave him a visa after a decade-long separation.

The English leg of Suu Kyi's trip is bound to include some family time. She will celebrate her 67th birthday on June 19 while in England, where Kim lives.

Suu Kyi's aides have offered few details about her trip aside from the destinations, saying only that she will pack medicine for motion sickness.

'She gets airsick and seasick very easily. She will have to take her pills to prevent airsickness,' said Win Htein, a senior official from her National League for Democracy party.

He said she was typically stoic ahead of her travels: 'She doesn't look too excited about it.'

Thailand was not part of the original itinerary but Suu Kyi decided last week to attend the economic forum.

She has a Friday speaking slot that is bound to be the event's main attraction.

Suu Kyi's appearance at the conference had threatened to upstage that of Myanmar President Thein Sein, but he canceled over the weekend citing 'urgent matters' at home, said Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Thani Thongphakdi. He rescheduled his first official visit to Thailand for next week.

Sad: Suu Kyi's commitment to her cause came at high personal cost. In 1999 she stayed in Myanmar even as her husband was dying of cancer in England. They last saw each other in 1995, after which the junta decided Mr Aris needed a visa

Thein Sein took power last year from the military junta following elections that were deemed unfair by international observers. Since then he has surprised much of the world by engineering sweeping reforms, though military leaders still have great control over the country.

Since Suu Kyi's release, many international dignitaries have visited her in Myanmar, including U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in December and British Prime Minister David Cameron in April. Cameron suggested she visit her 'beloved Oxford' in June.

Suu Kyi replied at the time: 'Two years ago I would have said 'Thank you for the invitation, but sorry.'

'But now I am able to say 'Perhaps,' and that's great progress.'
