In fact, Stewart was mocking Bush and his cohorts on his program Monday while discussing the Brian Williams scandal following the NBC anchor's false story about being on a helicopter that took enemy fire while in Iraq in 2003.

'Finally, someone is being held to account for misleading America about the Iraq war. It might not necessarily be the first person you’d want held accountable on that list,' said Stewart. 

'But never again will Brian Williams mislead this great nation about being shot at in a war we probably wouldn’t have ended up in if the media had applied this level of scrutiny to the actual f*cking war.'

He then showed clips of Dick Cheney, Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice and some of the statements they gave in interviews about the war, which many people now believe were false and misleading. 

As for Palin, Stewart said of the former vice presidential candidate last moth after a speech she gave in Iowa; 'Incoherent, rambling, unintelligible, folksy idioms — she’s not speaking at a political event, Sarah Palin is trying to is trying to sell America a Lincoln.'

Stewart (with Ed Helms, Stephen Colbert, Rob Corddry and Samantha Bee) announced he would be leaving The Daily Show on Tuesday

His most famous feud came not on his own show however, but when he appeared on Crossfire in 2004, and after being called out for not being funny by Carlson, said to the host; 'Nah, I’m not going to be your monkey.;

He then called him a 'dick.' 

This as Stewart announced he will leave at the end of this year, most likely when his contract expires in the Fall.

'Seventeen years is the longest I have ever in my life held a job by sixteen years and five months. The upshot there being I am a terrible employee. In my heart I know it is time for someone else to have that opportunity,' said the host on the program Tuesday.

'I don't have any specific plans. I have a lot of ideas. I have a lot of things in my head. We're going to have dinner on a school night with my family who I have heard from multiple sources are lovely people,' he added.

'You know, I'm not going to be here and try to sum up what this place has meant to be mover the years. I couldn't' do that. We got plenty of time.'

Getting emotional he then said; 'What is this fluid? What are these feelings? Frankenstein angry!'

He closed by saying; 'It's been an absolute privilege. It's been the honor of my professional life, and I thank you for watching it. For hate watching it. Whatever reason you were tuning in for.' 

Comedy Central, who is losing Stewart just months after Stephen Colbert departed the network to take over for David Letterman on The Late Show, also expressed how sad they were to see the popular host leave. 

'For the better part of the last two decades, I have had the incredible honor and privilege of working with Jon Stewart. His comedic brilliance is second to none,' Michele Ganeless, the network's president, said in a statement.

'Jon has been at the heart of Comedy Central, championing and nurturing the best talent in the industry, in front of and behind the camera. Through his unique voice and vision, ‘The Daily Show’ has become a cultural touchstone for millions of fans and an unparalleled platform for political comedy that will endure for years to come.'

'Jon will remain at the helm of The Daily Show’ until later this year,' she added.

'He is a comic genius, generous with his time and talent, and will always be a part of the Comedy Central family.'
