Andy Carroll is set to return to action in a fortnight and has begun training with West Ham’s first team.

The England striker tore ligaments in his left ankle in July during the club’s pre-season tour of New Zealand — the latest blow in his injury-ravaged time at West Ham since becoming their £15million record signing 16 months ago.

Carroll will play for West Ham’s Under 18s and 21s in the next two weeks to regain match fitness.

Manager Sam Allardyce, who has seen strikers Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia flourish at Upton Park since arriving in the summer, said: ‘It’ll be another two to three weeks, if he has no niggles or problems, before we talk about playing him in the team.

‘We’ll try to get him through three or four behind-closed-doors games and if that goes all right then we would hope to have him back... hopefully when he gets back he’ll have a major impact.

‘We’ve got to get some game time into him before we really put him back into the squad.’
