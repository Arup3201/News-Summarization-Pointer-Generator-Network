A United Airlines flight from London Heathrow to Washington, DC, was forced to make an emergency landing on Thursday evening after the captain reported smoke in the cockpit.

The flight crew declared an emergency while the Boeing 777-222 was flying over the Irish Sea and diverted the plane to Dublin Airport less than an hour into its transatlantic journey.

With smoke in the cockpit and forward cabin, members of the flight crew were forced to wear their oxygen masks, although the cabin crew found no visible evidence of a fire on board.

Flight UA925 was cruising at 36,000ft and had just crossed the Welsh when the crew alerted air traffic controllers around 5.45 pm, the Irish Independent reported.

The plane – carrying 139 passengers and crew – dumped fuel over Ireland so that it would be lighter when it landed. 

On its final approach to Dublin Airport the aircraft aborted its first landing attempt due to poor weather conditions and circled around to try again.

When the plane landed safely on its second attempt around 6.15pm it was met by firefighters and paramedics, who were placed on standby as a precaution.

Dublin Fire Brigade sent tweets saying it was responding with three pumps and an ambulance for the aircraft emergency.

Ireland's National Ambulance Service sent three ambulances as a precaution. 

The fire brigade later tweeted that the plane had landed safely and cleared the runway, and that an investigation was underway.

During the plane’s approach the airport activated its emergency plan and placed all other aircraft in a holding pattern until flight UA925 was on the ground.

The plane was taken out of service so that it could be inspected by engineers, but stranded passengers were forced to spend the night in Dublin.

In a statement, United Airlines said: 'The necessary maintenance work could not be completed before the crew exceeded their legally permitted duty hours.

'We provided overnight hotel accommodation for our customers and made arrangements for them to complete their journeys.

'We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience caused.'
