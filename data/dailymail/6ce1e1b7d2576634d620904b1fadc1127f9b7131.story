The Conservatives have come under fire for another 'dodgy' election advert after critics accused them of fattening-up Ed Miliband.

Commentators also slammed the Tories latest poster for its poor photoshop, which saw them switch Ed Ball's head for Alex Salmond's.

The latest own-goal comes after Tory spin doctors used a German road in a poster that claimed Britain is on the 'road to a stronger economy.'

 The Tories have come under fire for their latest election poster, pictured above,  for its poor photoshop

On social networking sites people accused the Conservatives of being 'skinflints' and branded the latest poster 'terrible.'

Others suggested the Tories had put the Labour leader in a 'fat suit.'

The poster, released on Friday,  targets both Labour and the Scottish National Party.

 Miliband has refused to rule out an alliance with Scottish nationalists.

It tells voters: 'The SNP would prop up Ed Miliband - meaning chaos for Britain.'

Above the doctored image of Miliband and former SNP leader Alex Salmond hugging, it reads. 'Your Worst nightmare... just got worse.'

The original image was of Miliband and the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, embracing in front of a pink backdrop. 

At the beginning of the month the Conservatives unveiled their first poster of the election campaign claiming that Britain is on the road to a stronger economy.

The image, depicting an empty road carving through green field, was initially criticised for being 'a bit French.'

But the Chancellor George Osborne was left with some explaining to do, after it was revealed that the image used was actually German and taken by photographer Alexander Burzik in Weimar.

Some efforts were made to cover up the deception. The entire image was flipped, cracks and discoloration removed from the road surface and the white lines erased.

The white clouds in the blue sky were also rearranged.

The words on the image also caused problems for Mr Cameron, with the claim: 'The deficit halved'.

It infuriated some experts, who pointed out that the deficit – the annual gap between the Government's spending and income – has been reduced from a peak of £153billion at the time of the election to £91billion this year, a fall of just over 40 per cent.

Back in March last year Osborne was forced to defend another advert aimed at working class voters, claiming 'they' enjoy bingo and cheap beer.

It was widely mocked online, and spawned spoof versions referring to whippets, clogs, eating swans, shooting poor people and suggesting the Tories think it is still 1961.

The advert read: ‘Bingo! Cutting the bingo tax and beer duty to help hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy. 

A spokesman for the Conservative party today 'categorically' denied that they had done anything to alter Miliband's appearance in their latest poster

'We definitely didn't do anything to it,' he said. 'The picture obviously just caught him from the wrong angle.'

The spokesman refused to discuss the quality photoshop, saying he did 'not notice it' and he suspected that it was produced by a graphic designer.
