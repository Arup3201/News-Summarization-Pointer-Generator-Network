A former prison guard, who was convicted for helping smuggle drugs into jail and illegally accessing the information of prisoners under her care, will be allowed to have her baby live with her behind bars.

The Court of Criminal Appeal decided that 'appropriate arrangements were in place' at a rural Darwin correctional centre for the one-year-old boy to stay with his mother, Sarah Dawn Rudd, during her jail term which has increased to nine months, according to NT News.

The 26-year-old will serve a five-year partially suspended sentence, which includes 12 months in home detention, after pleading guilty to 12 charges relating to her involvement in a drug and corruption syndicate while working as a guard at Berrimah prison in Darwin.

A spokesperson for the Department of Correctional Services told Daily Mail Australia: 'The Commissioner of Correctional Services may authorise a female prisoner to care for her young babies in custody where it is considered to be in the best interests of the child and the management and security of the correctional centre is not threatened'. 

Rudd held the baby in her arms and breastfed while she faced trial in August, according to NT News.

Crown prosecutor David Morters told the court that the correction centre boss Ken Middlebrook confirmed women with babies would be accommodated at the new jail, which was still under construction at the time.

'The new jail will support the provision of services to young children,' he said, according to NT News.

The Alice Springs mother was found guilty of instructing an inmate's partner on how to sneak Cannabis into the prison.

She also ran messages between bikie prisoner Jared Davis and other prisoners, who were attempting to organise a drug ring inside the jail.

Rudd was found to have illegally accessed confidential information from the Correction's database for Phillip Noel Kaye Rudd, who also supplied her with drugs, the ABC reports.

Despite her lawyer, John Tippet QC, arguing that none of her actions resulted in any serious harm, Crown prosecutor David Morters said she had undermined the criminal justice system.

Rudd and her partner, firefighter Anthony Butt, were both charged in May of 2013 for possessing steroids after returning from a trip to Thailand.
