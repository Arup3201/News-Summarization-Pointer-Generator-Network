Search crews have reportedly located the black box from missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.

Perth radio station 6PR tweeted the discovery, citing aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas had revealed the flight recorder had finally been found after more than a month of being missing.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who is in China, said he is 'very confident' the signals detected were from the black box from MH370.

'Encouraging': A total of four signals, matching those of a black box flight recorder, have now been detected by the Australian ship Ocean Shield in the search for flight MH370

The search co-ordination agency headed by retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston says there is now doubt over whether the pings recorded by search vessels are from the black box of the missing MH370 aircraft

'We have very much narrowed down the search area...and we are very confident the signals are from the black box from MH370,' he said.

'We have a series of detections, some lasting for quite a long period of time.

'We're now getting to the stage from where the black box is starting to fade. We're hoping to get as much information as we can before the signal finally expires.

'I really don't want to give any more information than that at this stage...as a sign of respect to the Chinese people and their families.'

Speaking from Shanghai, China, Mr Abbott said today's discovery was a huge step in solving the mystery.

'This is probably the most difficult search in human history,' he said.

'Among tragedy, however, there is hope.

'We are confident we know the position of the black box to the nearest kilometre.

'But confidence in the position is not the same as recovering the wreckage from more than 4.5km beneath the sea and finally determining all that happened on that flight.'

The fact that Mr Abbott has reportedly used the word 'confident' suggests that searchers are finally convinced that weeks of scouring the Indian Ocean might now have resulted in the discovery of the missing Boeing 777.

Mr Abbott has indicated he will first need to brief the Chinese because most of the 239 passengers were from that country.

Relatives have complained in the past of not being kept informed of progress in the search.

A fifth 'ping' from the black box of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was detected by a surveillance plane conducting an acoustic search yesterday, Australian officials said.

The latest signal was picked up by an Australian P-3 Orion aircraft, with on-board instruments tracing it to the same area where two pings were heard this week by Australian ship Ocean Shield.

More signals: A handout image released by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) shows the search area in the Indian Ocean, West of Australia, where  15 planes and 14 ships are scouring a 75,423 square km area of ocean for the wreckage of flight MH370 more than a month after it disappeared

Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, who is 
co-ordinating the search in Perth, said on Thursday: 'The acoustic data will require further analysis overnight but shows potential of being from a man-made source.'

Earlier he said the discovery by Ocean Shield was 
'further encouraging' news in the search for MH370.

He said the detection, on Tuesday afternoon, was held for about five minutes and 32 seconds, while the second was held for about seven minutes.

'Yesterday's [Tuesday's] signals will assist in better defining a reduced and much more manageable search area on the ocean floor' he said.

Despite what Mr Houston described as 'further encouraging findings' he said that the underwater vehicle 'Blue Fin 21', which can 'sniff out' objects deep in the ocean, would not be launched until the search area could be narrowed.

'I believe we are searching in the right area, but we need to visually identify aircraft wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of MH370,' he said.

'I'm not prepared to confirm anything until such time as somebody lays eyes on the wreckage.'

However, U.S. Navy Captain Mark 
Matthews said the detections indicate the device emitting the pings is 
somewhere within about a 12-mile radius.Â 

That would still equate to a 500 square mile chunk of the ocean floor - an area that would take the Bluefin sub between six weeks to two months to canvas.

Data analysis of the first two detections at the weekend has shown they were consistent with the specification and description of a flight data recorder, said the air chief marshal.

The Australian Joint Acoustic Analysis
 Centre based at HMAS Albatross in Nowra, on the NSW coast south of 
Sydney, concluded that the two detections were from a source that was 
not of 'natural origin' and was 'likely sourced' from specific 
electronic equipment.

Mr
 Houston, pointing out that his optimism had risen since Sunday, warned 
that a lot of silt could complicate the search, which is being boosted 
by a sonar buoy and a modified RAAF P3 aircraft to co-ordinate with 
Ocean Shield.

'It's 
important for Ocean Shield to collect as much data as possible ahead of 
deploying Blue Fin 21,' he said. 'The reason we want to do that is 
there's no second chances.'

The pings detected by the Australian Defence vessel Ocean Shield's pinger locator in the search for the missing flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder in the southern Indian Ocean may now not be released

The towed pinger locator (TPL-25) on the deck of the Australian Defense Vessel Ocean Shield detected two  signals which were thought to be from a black box transponder, but further analysis has shown the signals may have no connection with MH370

He warned that the recently-detected 
signals have been much weaker than the original signals detected - 'so 
that means probably we're either a long way from it, or in my view, more
 likely, the batteries are starting to fade and as a consequence the 
signal is becoming weaker.'

He added: 'So we need to, as we say in Australia, make hay while the sun shines.'

Ocean
 Shield, he said, would be looking to pick up more transmissions that 
would help to better pinpoint where the signal was coming from.

Once the search area has been narrowed, ships and aircraft could then find something in 'a matter of days,' he suggested.

He
 continued to express optimism that searchers were closing in on the 
plane's final resting place, despite what he believed were signals from 
dying batteries.

Bluefin 
21, takes six times longer to cover the same area as the pinger locator,
 which is pulled behind the boat at a depth of 3,000 metres.

Iinitial confidence of Royal Australian Navy Commodore Peter Leavy (pictured, right, with search chief Angus Houston last month) of the recorded pings being from missing MH370 has now waned

The sub's sonar can scan only
 about 100 metres and it can 'see' with lights and cameras only a few 
metres. The maximum depth it can dive is 4,500 metres, and some areas of
 the search zone are deeper.

Search
 crews are also contending with a thick layer of silt on the sea floor 
that can both hide any possible wreckage and distort the sounds 
emanating from the black boxes that may be resting there, said Mr Leavy,
 who is helping to lead the search.

Captain Matthews said: 'It's
 certainly a man-made device emitting that signal and I have
 no explanation for what other component could be there.

'I'm
 an engineer so I don't talk emotions too much. But 
certainly when I received word that they had another detection, you feel
 elated.

'You're hopeful that you can locate the final resting place of the aircraft and bring closure to all the families involved.'
