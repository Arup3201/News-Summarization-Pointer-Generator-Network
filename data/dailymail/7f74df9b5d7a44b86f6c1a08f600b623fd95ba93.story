Roy Hodgson believes England's young stars showed enough of their potential in the 0-0 draw with Costa Rica to suggest that the Three Lions can make an impact at Euro 2016.

Seven players players made their first World Cup starts in Belo Horizonte, including Luke Shaw, Ross Barkley and Jack Wilshere.

And although they couldn't help his side record a win in their final Group D game, Hodgson is confident that his Young Lions will continue to develop over the next two years.

Asked about the role Barkley and Co will play going forward, Hodgson told talkSPORT: 'They'll play a major part. Today we've played with nine players who had 
never played in the World Cup (before this tournament).

'We've just played Costa Rica, who have won the 
group, and I thought we dominated the game. Certainly there are a lot of very good young players coming through.

'Let's see how the young players develop over the next two years. As 
disappointed as I am, I do know that today has given me a lot of 
positives.

'If these young boys can perform like that at 18, 19 and 20, then
 in two years they could be even better.'

Hodgson also praised his new-look defence, who kept Joel Campbell quiet for England's first and only clean sheet in Brazil.

However the former Fulham and West Brom boss may need need a reminder of 28-year-old Gary Cahill's age, after including the Chelsea defender among the Three Lions' bright young things.

He added: 'The back-four did well. With the oldest of them, Gary Cahill at 24, we restricted them to one shot early on.'
