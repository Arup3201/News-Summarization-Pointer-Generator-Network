It's been a British way of life for as long as most of us can remember, but its time could finally be coming to an end.

After more than 800 years, the sit-down roast dinner with all the family is on its way out, a poll of 2,000 people revealed.

Weekday and Saturday family meals in front of the TV are fast becoming the norm as lifestyle changes and prime-time programming take over from tradition.

A poll of 2,000 people revealed that that the tradition of eating Sunday roast together as a family will soon become a thing of the past as more of us choose to eat together during the week or on Saturday

A new way of dining: 'Digital' eating - when family members fiddle with mobile phones, tablets and surf the web - is the modern way of bringing people together

But fears that traditional get-togethers around the dinner table are in decline are unfounded as more of us are eating together on weekdays and Saturdays 

The Sunday roast is believed to have its origins in medieval times, around the 12th century - when village serfs were rewarded with roasted ox by their masters after church.

According to energy firm SSE's Home of the Future Report, 80 per cent of poll respondents said they regularly ate with their families during Monday to Friday.

On Saturdays, a total of 67 per cent said they sat with 'all the family' to eat dinner compared to just 58 per cent on Sundays. 

The report states: 'During the industrial revolution, lunch was the mainstay meal.

'The 1970s saw the rise of the microwave dinner. However most of us upheld the traditional roast on a Sunday until now.

'Today families prefer to eat together on weekdays and Saturdays.'  

The study showed that 80 per cent dine with their families on Monday through to Friday whilst 67 per cent eat together on a Saturday. Only 58 per cent of respondents take part in the traditional Sunday roast  

SSE's Home of the Future Report found that 67% of Britons eat dinner in front of the TV 

British futurologist, Dr James Bellini said it was not a 'death knell' for the family, stating that 'digital dinners' - when families sit around the TV, fiddle with mobile phones, tablets and surf the web - were a way of bringing families together.

He said: 'Worries that the digital revolution will destroy family life will prove unfounded.

'Online technologies are creating the 'networked family', where smartphone devices and the rise of event TV and shared internet experiences are enabling new forms of family connectedness.'

The report also found that 67 per cent of Brits eat in front of the TV.

Father-of-three Jeremy Simpson, 44, of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, said: 'Sundays used to be a time for everyone to get together and have a big roast dinner, but it has just become another day in the week rather than being anything special.

'We used to sit together as a family every Sunday, but as our children grew up it became harder and harder to get them to all sit around for one big family meal.

'It just so happens that during the week and on Saturdays we often all naturally end up at the dinner table at the same time - sadly, on Saturdays it's usually when Strictly or X Factor is on.'
