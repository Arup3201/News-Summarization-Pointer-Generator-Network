A father has beaten cancer after doctors removed a tumour weighing almost one and a half stone from his stomach.

Barry Wilkes underwent a six hour operation to remove the massive growth, which was twice the size of his heart and weighed about 20lb.

‘The tumour in my abdomen was huge,’ said the 45-year-old, from Northfield, Birmingham.

Barry Wilkes, 45, was diagnosed with cancer after suffering nausea and stomach pain - doctors found a one and a half stone tumour in his abdomen

‘It looked twice the size of my heart on the CT scans.

‘I ended up losing 20lbs in weight while I was in hospital and the consultant said the tumour was responsible for most of that.

‘I was lucky I didn’t need chemotherapy or radiotherapy as they were able to get all the cancer through the surgery.’

Mr Wilkes went to his doctor in December 2011 after feeling sick and putting up with weeks of stomach pain.

Tests revealed the tumour had grown after cancer cells spread from another growth in his bowel.

The father-of-one went under the knife at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital in September last year, and both of the tumours and cancerous lymph nodes were removed.

Mr Wilkes had a six hour operation to remove the tumour in his abdomen as well as a growth in his bowel and cancerous lymph nodes. He did not have to have further treatment as the surgery successfully removed all of the cancerous cells

During the surgery, surgeons were forced to remove part of Mr Wilkes' bowel meaning his body now struggles to absorb food so he has to stick to a high-calorie diet

But the surgeons were also forced to take out part of Mr Wilkes’ bowel, leaving his body less able to absorb fat and forcing him onto a diet of crumpets, white bread, sandwiches and pasta.

‘My bowel and digestive system are having to adapt to the new way of working, which will take time,’ he said.

‘It’s gradually working better but my bowel has basically been stripped back to the basics.’

Twelve months after his surgery, the Halfords manager was told his latest scan was clear and he has walked 2,013km - more than 1,250 miles - in aid of Cancer Research UK.

Mr Wilkes' is now supporting Cancer Research UK's Stand Up to Cancer campaign which aims to persuade people to raise money for the charity by standing up for the whole of October 18

Now he has urged people to support the nationwide Stand Up to Cancer day on October 18.

Fundraisers can boost the fight against the disease by being sponsored to stand up for all or part of the day.

Cancer Research UK spokeswoman Paula Young said: ‘Barry is an inspiration and we are calling on everyone to follow in his footsteps and unite to Stand Up To Cancer on Friday, October 18.

‘Thanks to research, more people are surviving cancer than ever before.

‘But there’s still so much more to do. It’s not technology or knowledge that is holding back our fight against cancer - it’s funding.’
