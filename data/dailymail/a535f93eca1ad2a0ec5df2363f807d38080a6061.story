A two-year-old boy has become the latest star of the ice hockey world, after becoming the unofficial mascot of his favorite team when his goal celebration was shared across the internet.

Tyler Avolia's heartfelt reaction to a goal by the Pittsburgh Penguins was captured when his mother took him to a game at the Consol Energy Center in the city.

Tyler is now a bonafide hockey fanatic and has even been dubbed the 'Buckle Up Baby', in homage to the team's adopted slogan.

The young fan has now been taken to a total of four games, and his mother Hilary Avolia says the sport has become a central part of his life.

She told WTAE-TV: 'For Easter, we got him baseball stuff, but he's still just interested in hockey.

'Everything goes back to hockey.'

Ms Avolia told GMA Live! that her son had always liked hockey, but his passion for the sport really took off when he received equipment to allow him to play the game for Christmas.

She said: 'He's always liked it, and then for Christmas he decided he’d ask Santa for skates and a stick and nets, and we got them.

'Santa brought them for him, and he’s played every day ever since.'

Ty's goal reaction has now been circulated on websites across the internet.

The team adopted the phrase 'Buckle Up, Baby' after it was used by former Penguins player and current radio broadcaster Phil Borque during a match.
