A health monitoring smart collar for dogs could help owners and vets spot potential pet health problems

Not content with logging every detail about their own exercise regimes, diets and sleep patterns, humans have now created a FitBit-esque gadget for their canine companions.

A smart collar for dogs that measures heart and respiratory rates as well as counting calories could help owners and vets spot potential health problems.

Voyce claims it will let owners know what their dog is trying to tell them when it comes to health, including if they are getting enough exercise.

The device, which is like a FitBit for dogs, uses special algorithms and will provide owners with trends about their dog’s health and fitness, which they can view using an app.

‘Voyce monitors key vital signs including heart rate and respiratory rate, along with other wellness indicators such as activity, rest, calories burned, and more,’ I4C Innovations, the company behind the innovation said.

‘All of these data points come together to paint a more complete picture of your dog’s well being.’

The collar and app was developed in collaboration with biomedical engineers, dog experts, and Cornell University,Ithaca, New York and it could help vets gain an insight to a dog’s health between check-ups.

The smart collar, which went on show at the Consumer Electronics SHow (CES in las Vegas, measures a dog’s activity continually so that an owner will be able to track their pet’s behaviour and weight.

Changes in activity level could indicate early signs of common conditions including arthritis, hip dysplasia, heart and lung problems and anxiety, which could lead to early diagnosis and treatment.

With a heartrate monitor built in, the collar will provide a daily average of beats per minute and can provide clues about conditions such as heart disease or chronic pain.

The system will detect abnormalities by monitoring recent trends and changes in breathing can also indicate health conditions, which is why the collar monitors an animal’s respiratory rate.

The idea is that if medical conditions are caught early, it could improve a dog’s quality of life and reduce treatment costs for owners.

Counting the number of calories the 
canine burns, the device can compare data to previous trends, which 
could help an owner make sure their dog does not become fat.

The smart collar can also monitors a 
dog’s rest patterns, checking for decreasing periods of rest or 
interrupted sleep, which are often indications of discomfort or bad 
health, the experts said.

The company said the collection of information will be particularly valuable to owners and vets who will be able to see how it changes over time and the app also will also provide recommendations to improve the health of pets.

Designed for dogs of all ages, the 
smart collar can goals based on an animal’s individual needs, whether 
that is shedding a few pounds or bettering training.

As the app gets to know the dog, it will send owners customised tips and advice.

‘With each new insight, you’ll get closer to understanding how your dog is feeling, thinking, and behaving,’ the company said.

The firm plans to sell the collar for around $299 and there will be a monthly subscription fee of $15, The Washington Post reported, but so far there is no indication of a release date or whether the device will go on sale in the UK.
