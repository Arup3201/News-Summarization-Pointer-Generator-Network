A 12-year-old boy has killed himself after schoolmates bullied him for being a cheerleader, according to friends.

Ronin Shimizu, a former student at Folsom Middle School in Folsom, California, took his life on Wednesday afternoon but police are not releasing any further details about his death. 

The school district has confirmed that the boy's parents, who also have a younger son, complained on multiple occasions that he was being bullied and officials said that they followed protocol.

But friends say that the taunting continued. He recently left Folsom Middle School to be home schooled.

Tragedy: Ronin Shimizu, 12, took his life on Wednesday after friends say he was bullied for being the only male cheerleader on his middle school's team (right). His parents had previously complained to the school

Joy: Friends said that bullies called him 'gay' for cheerleading but that he loved being part of the team

Shock: Some friends say they were stunned he was so unhappy because he always had a smile on his face

On Thursday night, friends and their parents gathered outside the Shimizu home to hold a quiet candle light vigil.

'I heard that people called him gay because he was a cheerleader,' one of his teammates told CBS Sacramento at the vigil.

Ronin was the only male cheerleader with the Vista Junior Eagles Cheer Team.

'Bullying him because of cheerleading… it's not right,' 11-year-old Mia Kleinbardt told Fox40. 'It's what he loves to do.'

Other friends expressed their shock, saying Ronin never revealed how much he was hurting.

'He was always so passionate like he didn't care what a lot of people said,' Hunter Reed, a friend from drama club, told Fox40. 'He just kept going on with life. He was always so happy, like the happiest person I've ever met.' 

Tragedy: Ronin, who had a little brother, had recently left the middle school to be home schooled

Loss: Ronin was remembered as a friendly student who loved drama and making his own clothes

Folsom Cordova School District added that they have a comprehensive anti-bullying campaign.

'I heard that somebody called the bullies and told them that he passed away and they were like shocked,' another child, Riley Coleman, said. They 'learned their lesson on how words can hurt.' 

Daniel Thigpen with the Folsom Cordova School District said that officials were looking into the complaints made by the boy's family.

'Any allegations bullying related to this specific incident, we're certainly reviewing how we responded to those and we'll use that as an opportunity to always take a look at how we respond to future allegations,' he said.

Grief counselors are at the school to help students and staff. 

The Vista Jr Eagles, the team Ronin had cheered for, also released a statement as they shared photos of the young, grinning boy in his cheer uniform.

Remembered: Friends and parents gathered for a candle-lit vigil outside his house on Thursday

'Tragically, we lost one of our own yesterday, Ronin Shimizu,' it read. 'Please support his family through this extremely difficult time... Please keep all of them in your thoughts and prayers.'
