A 57-year-old hunter is dead after one of his companions slipped in the mud and accidentally shot him in the back in northern Utah. 

The man was shot on Tuesday afternoon in a remote area west of the tiny town of Paradise, about 80 miles north of Salt Lake City, Cache County deputies say.

He was later identified as Norman Newbold of Syracuse, Utah.

Deputies say four men were hunting pheasants at a sportsman's club when one man slipped and accidentally fired his 12-gauge shotgun, shooting Newbold. 

He was transported to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Deputies say they're investigating, but believe the shooting was an accident and don't anticipate any criminal charges in the case.

Cache County sheriff, Lt. Mike Peterson, told The Salt Lake Tribune: 'The were all recreating up here, getting some late-season pheasant hunting in.

All of the evidence in this incident is indicating this was a tragic accident.'
