Celtic have ramped up the post Old Firm feelgood factor by finally landing Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven from Dundee United.

The captures of the Tannadice pair for a combined £2million fee signalled a shift in the Parkhead club’s transfer strategy back towards home-spun talents.

A left-field move for Kilmarnock striker Robbie Muirhead failed to materialise and on deadline day United moved in and were putting the finishing touches to his transfer to Tayside. But Derry City winger Michael Duffy completed his move to Celtic Park as expected.

However, it is the completion of moves for two of the Scottish game’s brightest lights that will leave fans of the champions convinced that Ronny Deila’s reign will now go from strength to strength.

Mackay-Steven had already agreed to join Celtic under freedom of contract this summer, but last week the champions had a bid of £150,000 to take him immediately rejected. 

Matters gathered apace on Monday evening, however, with an improved £250,000 offer finally matching United’s valuation. Celtic had started the day by improving upon an earlier bid of £1.5m for Armstrong, only to have that kicked into touch. Their willingness to up the fee to around £1.75m finally saw United cave in and the player travelled with his team-mate to Glasgow for medicals before the deals were sealed.

While United have now sold £8m of talent since the summer — with Sporting Lisbon’s Ryan Gauld and Hull’s Andrew Robertson netting them £3m apiece — they will now face Celtic in the League Cup Final on March 15 without their two prized assets. Neither player can turn out for Celtic, however, because they are cup tied.

Former Ross County and Liverpool youth player Mackay-Steven, 24, won his first full Scotland cap against the USA in 2011. Armstrong, 22, started out at Inverness before joining United in 2010 and Gordon Strachan rewarded his progress with a place in the Scotland squad which travelled to Croatia two years ago.

The capture of Duffy proved a rather more straightforward deal with the Northern Ireland Under-21 winger moving to Glasgow for a nominal fee after a successful trial.

Kris Commons remains a Celtic player — for the time being — after an expected bid from Bolton failed to materialise on Monday night. Neil Lennon had hoped to use the proceeds from the £1m sale of Lee Chung-yong to Crystal Palace to fund the move but with that transfer going to the wire  there was insufficient time for him to test the resolve of his former club.

Lennon remains keen to be reunited with Commons in the Championship and will get his wish by agreeing a pre-contract agreement next week unless the player is granted the straight two-year deal he desires with Celtic before then.

The prospect of Celtic moving for Barry Bannan floundered when he moved from Palace to Bolton on loan while speculation linking Deila with a spectacular swoop for Darren Fletcher ended when he joined West Brom.

While Armstrong and Mackay-Steven signed for Celtic, former Dundee United defender Paul Dixon, 28, rejoined the Tannadice club from Huddersfield. But United failed in a bid to lure their former midfielder Scott Allan back from Hibs.
