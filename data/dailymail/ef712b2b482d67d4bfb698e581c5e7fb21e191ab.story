Making a splash: The Duchess of Cambridge has been taking one-year-old Prince George for swimming lessons in the private pool at Buckingham Palace

The teenage Queen finessed her breaststroke there. A young Prince Charles sailed toy boats across it. It’s where Prince William learnt to swim — and now Prince George goes there for his weekly splash about.

For, as the Mail recently revealed, the Duchess of Cambridge has been taking one-year-old George for swimming lessons in the private pool at Buckingham Palace, a place steeped in history and tradition.

Over the past 76 years, nearly every member of the Firm has learnt to swim in the pool, which has survived bomb damage and outlasted a king.

Yet apart from one photograph taken during World War II, when the pool was bombed, it remains an extremely private place of leisure for the Royals, with no publicly available images of the interior.

Indeed, the only clues to its design stem from a letter that Sir Philip Sassoon, from the Ministry of Works, wrote to King George VI in 1938 when the pool was being designed. He requested the Monarch’s approval for the lining and walkway around the pool to be made of vitreous mosaic tiles rather than the glazed variety as it was ‘less harsh in appearance and less slippery’.

Enclosing samples of the tiles, he suggested the edge be marked in black mosaic with two bands of green, one below the level of the water and another near the bottom of the pool, to add ‘sparkle and liveliness to the water’.

As his design suggests, the pool is certainly not extravagant, and it has none of today’s usual trappings of a jacuzzi, sauna or sunbeds.

But it is popular. Prince Philip still swims there every day. Although, perhaps surprisingly, it isn’t just the blue-blooded Windsors who enjoy the privilege of bathing there. According to royal author Brian Hoey, members of the Staff Sports Club can use the pool at ‘certain specified times’ when no member of the Royal family wants to swim. Although, of course, there is a special protocol.

‘The rule is that if a staff member is swimming and one of the Royals appears, they have to get out, unless invited to remain, which often happens,’ Hoey says in his book, Not In Front of the Corgis: Secrets Of Life Behind The Royal Curtains.

‘If when the staff member turns up a Royal is already in the pool, the servant, and this includes senior members such as the Private Secretary or Keeper of the Privy Purse, will not attempt to join them. It’s a rule that seems to work well and these days the Duke of Edinburgh is the only permanent royal resident at the Palace who still uses the pool regularly.’

Staff are also only allowed to swim in a minimum group of three, in case anyone gets into trouble — so that one can stay with the casualty and the other raise the alarm. And while there is no strict clothing code as such, the natural decorum of Palace residents mean you will not see overly revealing swimming attire.

But its newest attendee, Prince George, is a particularly special guest given that the pool was conceived by the newly crowned King George VI to guard the privacy of his daughters Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. He commissioned it when the family was adapting to its newly public role two years after the abdication of Edward VIII, .

‘While they were still living at Piccadilly, the Princesses had been enjoying swimming lessons at the Bath Club and no one had taken much notice of the two little girls in their regulation swimming costumes,’ writes Edna Healey, wife of former Labour chancellor Denis, In her book The Queen’s House. ‘But now that Princess Elizabeth was heir to the throne they attracted too much attention.

‘So in summer 1938 it was decided to build ‘a swimming bath and squash court on the north side of the Palace in one of Nash’s conservatories.’

Scottish architect James Jack Roberts, then a 26-year-old employee of HM Office of Works, produced drawings for the North-West pavilion — on the right-hand side of the palace and designed by renowned architect John Nash in the 19th century — to be converted into a pool.

Though little is heard or told of the pool now, its construction was covered in the press at the time: ‘When Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret Rose returned to Buckingham Palace with King George VI and Queen Elizabeth from Balmoral recently, they found a big surprise awaiting them in the Palace grounds,’ read one newspaper article, dated January 14, 1939.

‘The surprise was a new swimming pool, which was specially constructed for the two little princesses so they may have their weekly swimming lessons next year at their own home.

‘While the Court was in Scotland, workmen were busy digging out the pool, which is a full-sized affair with the bottom and walls of thick concrete, and now they are engaged on the final process of tiling. The pool will, it is hoped, be ready for the princesses to have their first swim in it in the spring. Princess Elizabeth, who has been having lessons for about three years, is already a fine swimmer and this year she passed with honours her test for a life-saving certificate.

‘Her younger sister, Princess Margaret Rose, although she has not been learning to swim so long, is already proficient. Almost every weekend during the summer, the princesses have races and games in their other pool at Royal Lodge, Windsor Great Park, Berkshire.’

Water babies: After the war, the pool was rebuilt and a second generation of royals learnt to swim with Prince Charles and Princess Anne (pictured with their parents in 1953) both took their first strokes there

The future Queen was already an adept swimmer as she and her sister had been taught at a young age by veteran swimming teacher Amy Daly, of the Bath Club, who also trained their aunt, the Princess Royal, at the leisure centre near their former home at 145 Piccadilly.

Miss Daly never got into the pool but taught her pupils the motions by lying on a wooden bench, before they got into the water. She then tied a rope around the young princesses’ waists and pulled them along on a wooden pole, gradually releasing the rope until they swam unaided. Margaret, who was younger, plumper and clumsier, was at a disadvantage. ‘You look like an aeroplane about to conk out,’ her sister once joked. And when she clung to the edge of the pool, Elizabeth told her: ‘Don’t be a limpet.’

‘The then Princess Elizabeth showed no fear of the water either in swimming or diving and went on to an advanced level, winning a silver medal for life-saving when she was still a very young girl,’ added Hoey.

However the two young princesses barely had time to enjoy their gift before World War II broke out. On September 10, 1940, a year after the pool was completed, it was damaged during the Blitz by a delayed-action bomb.

The Royal Family was not in residence when the bomb exploded, shattering the windows in the North Wing — although four days later they were in an upstairs sitting room at the Palace when it was hit for the second time, by five German bombs, sparking the Queen’s famous remark: ‘I’m glad we’ve been bombed. Now I can look the East End in the eye.’

Photographs survive of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth inspecting the damage with the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. On the back of one picture, the King wrote: ‘Bomb exploded at 1.25am Tuesday September 10. Every window broken on all floors. The only exception is swinging lamp under garden entrance canopy.’

After the war, the pool was rebuilt and a second generation of royals learnt to swim — Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward all took their first strokes there.

But it was an eight-year-old Prince Charles who decided it was the perfect location for an alternative hobby: sailing model boats. He even invited fellow pupils from exclusive Knightsbridge prep school Hill House — where he spent two terms, the first member of the royal family to attend school rather than be tutored privately — to trek a mile down the road to join him on his adventures.

Early start: Both Prince Charles and Princess Diana splashed about in the pool teaching William and Harry to swim. Prince Charles revealed later that he had instilled a love of water in his eldest son from an early age

Fellow pupil Richard Alston, 65, said later: ‘We all made small model boats in woodwork and Charles invited us to the swimming pool at Buckingham Palace to sail them. As we went to launch ours, he brought out his replica of the Britannia. Life was not fair at times.’

In later years, Princess Diana regularly used the pool, leaving home at 7am in a scarlet tracksuit and driving from Kensington Palace to Buckingham Palace for a 20-minute swim.

Leaving her bikinis for holidays, she donned a one-piece to swim up to 30 lengths of breaststroke, crawl and backstroke, to limber up for her day.

Like most dedicated swimmers, Diana was loath to miss her early morning exercise. At Sandringham, which has no pool, she drove to the nearby Knights Hill Health Club, often taking Fergie with her for an hour’s swim followed by aerobics. She even swam in the Buckingham Palace pool on the first day of her official separation from the Prince of Wales and retreated there for a solitary swim on Christmas Day that year.

In happier times both Prince Charles and Princess Diana splashed about in the pool teaching William and Harry to swim. Prince Charles revealed later that he had instilled a love of water in his eldest son from an early age.

‘I threw him in the swimming pool on occasions,’ he said. ‘Instead of putting him off, it enthused him.’

Now Prince George is splashing around in the pool — perhaps the most exclusive stretch of water in Britain.
