After being sacked for dropping the F-bomb live on air, there's not much left for a TV news anchor to do but make fun of himself.

And after an embarrassing Anchorman-style gaffe on air in Wichita, Kansas, that's exactly what newscaster Justin Kraemer has done.

Having been dismissed from the station in December, Kraemer has now unveiled a spoof re-enactment of a scene from the Will Ferrell film.

TV news anchor Justin Kraemer, who was fired for dropping the F-bomb on air, posted an Anchorman-style spoof video of his story

The video, posted on his YouTube channel, features him pleading for his job before having a Ron Burgundy-style breakdown.

At the end, a down-on-his-luck Kraemer is seen stumbling down a road swigging from a bottle of milk to drown his sorrows before being shunned by his former colleagues.

The video has attracted hundreds of comments from viewers on the site, most of which are fully supportive of him.

John Speer said: 'Classic.... Justin, I'll be excited to see where you land! Keep smiling.﻿'

Jessica Bowlby said: 'Not gonna lie, that was pretty great.'

Kraemer's original blooper happened when he and his co-hosts were signing off for the night in December just before Saturday Night Live.

The credits had started to roll and 
the screen shot had just switched to an image of the Wichita skyline at night when Kraemer could clearly be heard to murmur 
to his co-hosts 'let's get the f*** out of here.'

Kraemer,
 originally from New York state, is an experienced hand in local news 
and worked for KSN from 2008 until he lost his job.

He also worked as a reporter for more than a decade, according the 
station's website, and has worked alongside Brian Williams on MSNBC and 
on CNN.
