He is one of Britain's most prolific and commercially successful artists with a rumoured fortune of more than £215m.

And now Damien Hirst is getting a whole new generation hooked on his controversial artwork through a children's ABC book.

Out this month, the tome features one of his works alongside each letter of the alphabet.

A is for Anatomy, represented by Hymn, the 20ft anatomical 
cross-section that launched his career, while D is, unsurprisingly, for Diamond, accompanied by a picture of For the Love 
of God diamond-encrusted skull.

From A is for Anatomy to Z is for Zebra, the reader will be able to discover Hirst's paintings in the book

Children are now able to discover Hirst's paintings, 
sculptures, and much more on each page of the illustrated alphabet book.

His work, which addresses science, philosophy and religious issues that lie at the heart of human existence, is represented in 26 bite-sized chunks.

The book is also a 
window into typography. Each letter represents an alphabetically-led 
font: A is for Albertus, B is for Baskerville. It is printed using child friendly 'soya bean ink'.

Hirst, 48, from Bristol, who has three young sons of his own, taps into a new market of art books for children with his new venture.

'I love L is for Lamb. The image is of my 1994 work Away from the Flock [a lamb in a tank of formaldehyde],' HIrst tells the Guardian.

But while J is for Jaws - and features Hirst's 
pickled shark, mouth open, razor-sharp teeth bared - Hirst doesn't believe 
children will be frightened by the book.

'My intention with The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living (1991) was to replicate the sort of fear you might feel on being confronted with a shark. It's the fear of death, but I've always noticed kids love it rather than being frightened of it.'

O is for Orange is one of the tamer pages in Damien's new book for children

'When we are no longer children, we are already dead,' said Constantin Brancusi in one of Hirst's favourite quotes.

The book is published by Other Criteria,
an arts-based publishing company co-founded by Damien Hirst, with a 
gallery on New Bond Street and shops in Marylebone, and Devon.

Hirst's work can be found in several important collections worldwide, including Tate, London, UK; British Council, UK and MoMA, New York, USA. He received the Turner Prize in 1995.
