The Australian tycoon planning to build a replica of the Titanic says he will unveil designs for his new liner at a gala dinner in New York in December.

Flamboyant billionaire Clive Palmer originally announced plans to build 'Titanic II' - a cruise ship with the same dimensions as its ill-fated 
predecessor - in April this year.

He will hold a dinner on the retired 
aircraft carrier USS Intrepid, moored in New York, on December 4 when he will unveil the designs with the help of John F. Kennedy's daughter Caroline.

unveil plans for Titanic ll at a gala dinner in New York in December

The Titanic leaving Southampton on her ill-fated maiden voyage on April 10, 1912. She was dubbed the 'unsinkable ship' before sinking off the coast of America killing more than 1300 passengers

moored in New York

Among those attending will be the former US president's daughter, his sister Jean Kennedy Smith and New York Senator Ruth Hassell-Thompson along with leading US business leaders, Palmer said.

They will be treated to a dinner from the same menu as Titanic passengers on the day it sank on April 12, 1912.

'It will be a chance for the business 
community of the United States and indeed the world to see the wonderful
progress that's been made on our Titanic II project,' Palmer said.

'Since we announced our plan in April we've had a huge amount of interest, particularly from people wanting to know how they can secure a booking for the maiden voyage, along with commercial sponsors.'

The first voyage remains set for 2016, with the boat due to sail from China, where it will be built, to Southampton in England ahead of her maiden passenger journey to New York.

The new ship will mirror its 
predecessor's dimensions -- measuring 270 metres long (885 feet), 53 
metres high and weighing 40,000 tonnes.

It will have 840 rooms and nine decks and retain the first, second and third-class divisions of the original.

Palmer
extended an invitation for James Cameron to sail on the ship, saying 
the Titanic director had complained there were no Titanic-related 
experiences left for him.

'Well James, this is something you can do,' he said.

Mr Palmer built a fortune on real estate on Australia's Gold Coast tourist strip before becoming a coal mining magnate.

More than 1,300 passengers perished when the Titanic hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage on April 12, 1912. 

Earlier this year, a memorial cruise 
carrying relatives of Titanic victims among its 1,309 passengers, the 
same number as on the doomed ship – set sail from Southampton for the 
Titanic’s wreck site.

BRW magazine reported he was 
Australia's fifth-richest person last year with an estimated fortune of 
more than AUS$5billion (£3.2billion).

Mr Palmer said at an earlier press 
conference that previous attempts to build a Titanic replica failed 
because proponents failed to raise enough money and commission a 
shipyard.

The
new nine-deck, 840-room ship will be constructed to the same dimensions as 
the Belfast-built White Star Liner - 270 metres long, 53 metres high and
weighing 40,000 tonnes.

Poignant: Passengers take part in the Titanic memorial service 100 years after the disaster at the site where it sunk in the North Atlantic. About 50 of the 1,309 passengers on board have a direct link with the doomed liner

Legacy: Alex Aaronson, six, from north America, whose relative Artie Frost, 38, perished on the Titanic, in the new memorial garden at Belfast City Hall on the 100th anniversary of the ship sinking
