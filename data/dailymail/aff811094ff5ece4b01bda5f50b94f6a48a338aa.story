Fountains of purple dye shower the streets of Srinagar in Kashmir - but this isn't a festive occasion.

These protestors engulfed in coloured water are government employees who took to the streets of the Kashmiri summer capital today to demand better employee rights, including retirement age enhancement and an end to pay anomalies.

The police weilding the water cannons use the brightly-coloured dye for one reason only - to identify and arrest dissidents.

Defiant: Hundreds of furious government employees gathered this afternoon at the Sher-e-Kashmir Municipal Park to begin their demonstration demanding better working conditions

Police used high-velocity jets of water and batons to break up the march, which began in the afternoon at the Sher-e-Kashmir Municipal Park.

Reports said some two dozen employees had been arrested during the protest.

The state of Jammu and Kashmir has seen a rise in violent protests recently, with a revival of 
anti-Indian sentiment among the Kashmiri Valley population seeing 
attacks on security forces and a growing level of tension across the 
Indian-controlled region.

Many Kashmiris feel India has not made enough concessions to the region, and security sources say the rise of more conservative strains of Islam and high unemployment have fuelled unrest.

Laws protecting security forces from 
trial are still in place, access to new technology is limited - 
including basic methods such as text messaging - and there is a heavy 
military and police presence in the state.

In recent years, the government has been accused of trying to criminalise protesters and curb public speaking.

Demands: Reports say dozens of protestors were arrested as they called for an increase of the retirement age from 58 to 60 years, a release of arrears, a salary boost and regularisation of their jobs

All this adds to the territorial dispute across the former princely state of Kashmir, that sees it split between Pakistani, Indian and Chinese rule.

Now an approaching general election has led some to accuse the government of manipulating this instability.

Following the deaths of five Indian soldiers on the Pakistani-Indian border through Kashmir on August 6, Pakistani Prime Minister called for better relations with India in an attempt to ease the strain across the region.

In today's protests, government employees marched towards Jammu and the high-security Gupkar Road residence of Chief Minister Omar Abdullah.
