America's most lethal sniper claimed he wished he'd 'killed more' Iraqis despite accumulating 160 confirmed kills - with the true number estimated to be as high as 255.

Speaking just months before his untimely death, Chris Kyle insisted his only regret was that US lives were lost because he shot too few of the enemy.

The late veteran's wartime exploits are portrayed in the divisive Oscar-tipped movie American Sniper, starring Bradley Cooper and directed by Clint Eastwood.

Little regrets: In an interview three years ago America's most lethal sniper Chris Kyle claimed he wished he'd 'killed more' Iraqis

Speaking to Toby Harnden of The Sunday Times three years ago, Kyle was asked whether he regretted any of his kills while on tour.

Replying in his characteristically soft Texan drawl, the former sniper, said: 'No, sir, not at all. 

'To be honest with you, I wish I'd killed more because every kill saved American lives and that was what I was out there for.'

Kyle was thrilled by the success of his autobiographical book, which led to 'huge fascination' with the grisly art of snipers.

The soldier, played by Bradley Cooper in Oscar-tipped film American Sniper (L), accumulated 160 confirmed kills in Iraq, with the true number estimated to be as high as 255

In the 2012 interview, he added: 'It's been a taboo for too long, I'm glad that people are actually looking at it with an interest and saying these guys are actually something we need.'

Less than a year after the conversation, Kyle was killed on a remote shooting range in Texas by a disturbed veteran he was helping, who was said to have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Opinion: Seth Rogen caused a Twitter storm with a tweet about American Sniper

The movie based on Kyle's book, produced by and starring Bradley Cooper, has been a box office hit, but has also divided opinion, with some criticising the film's jingoistic stance. 

Filmmaker Michael Moore caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' since his uncle died by a Japanese sniper shot in World War II.

Taking to Twitter in rage, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.'

Seth Rogen also caused controversy after tweeting: 'American Sniper kind of reminds me of the movie that's showing in the third act of Inglorious Basterds.'

The comedy actor faced a storm of online abuse for his comment and recently issued a clarification and apology.

He wrote: ‘It appears I need to further clarify a tweet I sent a few days ago. 

'I said a sniper movie kind of reminded me of a scene in another movie that involved a sniper movie. 

'I didn't compare the two at all. I merely said that one kind of reminded me of the other, because they both involved plots about the most lethal of snipers.

‘People then claimed that I compared the movie American Sniper to Nazi propaganda, something I would never do. 

'I'm sorry if this somehow offended anyone, but that was not my intention. I hope this clears things up.’ 

Critics of the movie included talk show host Bill Maher, who claimed the film is only cleaning up at the box office because audiences lap up its 'psychopath' hero.

Speaking on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher, he drew on excerpts from the autobiography Kyle wrote before he was killed in February 2013, in which he said he enjoyed war and referred to his targets as 'savages'.

Kid Rock was one of the first stars to wade in on the debate stirred up by Rogen and Moore, tweeting: ‘: 'F— you Michael Moore, you’re a piece of s— and your uncle would be ashamed of you. Seth Rogen, your uncle probably molested you. I hope both of you catch a fist to the face soon.

'God bless you Chris Kyle, Thank you for your service.'

'Psychopath patriot - and we love him': Talk show host Bill Maher was uncompromising in his criticism of Kyle - and seized

He chose parts of the book, also called American Sniper, where Kyle said 'I love killing bad guys - even with the pain I loved what I was doing.' 

The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, was then compared with Hurt Locker, another film centered on the Iraq war which made far less money, though won widespread praise.

Maher said: 'Hurt Locker' made $17million because it was a little ambiguous and thoughtful... [American Sniper] is just "American hero! He's a psychopath patriot, and we love him."' 

American Sniper has earned six Oscar nominations, including Best Actor for Bradley Cooper.
