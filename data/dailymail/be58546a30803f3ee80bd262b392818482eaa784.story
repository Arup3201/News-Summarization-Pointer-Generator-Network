It's one of America's top-selling lip balms, with 130 pots sold every minute worldwide.

And now the family behind the distinctive-smelling Carmex ointment have opened the doors of their Franklin, Wisconsin, factory for one of the first times.

Paul Woelbing, 58, who inherited the company from his grandfather Alfred, led the Journal Sentinel on a guided tour of the 40,0000-square-foot plant.

He revealed it as a pretty 'eccentric' place to work with a giant pipe organ installed on the factory floor. He doesn't play the keyboard, but musicians often stop by to tickle the ivories.

One Carmex employee described it as an 'amazing' sound that wafts throughout the facility as they stack boxes of chap remedy to ship.

Woelbing added: 'We've got the space for it and we like music. The employees enjoy it so that's why we built it.'

The antique theater organ boasts four keyboards, 32 foot pedals and more than 400 stop tabs for different sounds. 

It is powered by a 40-horsepower electric motor that's housed in a bunker-like room upstairs along with other mechanical pieces.

Speaking further about the family-run operation, Paul Woelbing said: 'We're kind of an eccentric bunch around here . . . And I'm probably the most eccentric.'

There are currently around 100 people involved in the Carmex production process, including Paul and his brother.
