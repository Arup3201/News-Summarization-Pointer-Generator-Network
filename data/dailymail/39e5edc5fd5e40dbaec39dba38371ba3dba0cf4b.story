French fighter jets had to accompany a hijacked Ethiopian Airlines plane into Geneva airport because the Swiss air-force only work during regular office hours, it has emerged.

An Ethiopian Airlines co-pilot - named locally as Hailemedehin Abera Tagegn - hijacked the plane bound for Rome and flew it to Switzerland yesterday, after threatening to crash it.

When the plane landed the 30-year-old Ethiopian escaped from the cockpit down a rope and asked to seek asylum saying he wasn't safe in his own country.

However, today it was revealed that it was Italian and French pilots who were scrambled to escort the plane into land and the Swiss played no part in the mission.

The Swiss pilots were alerted to the problem at 4.30am but are only operational in normal office hours - not before 8am.

Escape: A rope can be seen hanging from the window of the cockpit where the pilot fled yesterday after landing in Geneva airport after being escorted by fighter jets

Distressed: A family member of Hailemedhin Abera, 31, has said the co-pilot had been upset for the past month over the death of his uncle

Reddit user OK3n has posted an account of the hijacking from inside the plane, in which he says Abera told passengers 'sit down, put your masks on, I'm cutting the oxygen'

The passenger then says he was left for six hours to ponder his fate while cabin crew walked around giving out drinks and trying to keep everybody calm

He said the attendants didn't give out any information on what was happening, but could be seen crying

A Swiss airforce spokesman Laurent Savary told AFP: 'Switzerland cannot intervene because its airbases are closed at night and on the weekend. It's a question of budget and staffing.'

The Boeing 767-300 aircraft with 202 
passengers and crew on board had taken off from the Ethiopian capital, 
Addis Ababa, and landed in Geneva at about 6am local time with just 20 
minutes of fuel remaining.

The plane circled around Geneva until the co-pilot, who had worked for the airline for five years, had no criminal record and was declared medically sane, heard a direct response about his requests for asylum, it has been reported.

Geneva airport chief executive Robert 
Deillon told reporters that the co-pilot,
 took control of the plane when the pilot left the cockpit.

According to Sky News, passengers said 
the pilot repeatedly demanded the co-pilot open the cockpit door but the
 hijacker refused and threatened to crash the plane if the pilot carried
 on.

‘The pilot went to the toilet and he (the co-pilot) locked himself in the cockpit,’ Mr Deillon said.

The man "wanted asylum in Switzerland",' he said. ‘That's the motivation of the hijacking.’

Precaution: Geneva Airport was temporarily closed when the hijacked plane landed

An Ethiopian man smuggled a pistol onto a plane and hijacked a Lufthansa flight going from Frankfurt to Addis Ababa in 1993. He demanded it be flown to the U.S. because he was denied a visa.

In June and April 1994, Ethiopian Airlines suffered two hijackings at the hands of passengers who demanded to be flown to Europe, according to the Aviation Safety Network, which tracks aviation hijackings and other incidents.

In 1995, an Ethiopian man trying to avoid being sent back home used a knife from a food tray to commandeer an Olympic Airlines jet just before it landed in Athens, Greece. Police overpowered the hijacker with no injuries to any of the 114 people on board, according to AP reports.

Also that year, five armed men seized an Ethiopian Airlines jetliner and demanded the plane be flown to Greece and then Sweden. It was instead diverted to Al Obeid, about 300 miles (480 kilometers) west of Khartoum, Sudan.

In 1996 a flight from Ethiopia to Ivory Coast via Kenya was seized by hijackers who then demanded to be flown to Australia. That flight ran out fuel and crashed off the island nation of Comoros, killing 125 people, according to the Aviation Safety Network.

In 2001, five military pilot trainees wrested control of a plane during a flight from Bahr Dar, in northwestern Ethiopia, to the capital Addis Ababa and demanded to be flown to Saudi Arabia. The plane didn't have enough fuel so it landed in neighboring Sudan, according to AP reports.

In 2002 two passengers armed with small knives and an explosive device attempted to hijack a domestic flight but were shot and killed by in-flight security, the Aviation Safety Network reported.

The
 hijacking began over Italy, Switzerland's southern neighbour, and two 
Italian fighter jets were scrambled to accompany the plane, Mr Deillon 
said.

The co-pilot himself 
alerted authorities to the plane's hijacking, officials added - though 
passengers on the plane were unaware it had been hijacked. After landing
 in Geneva, the co-pilot exited the cockpit using a rope and turned 
himself in to authorities.

Police escorted passengers one by one, with their hands above their heads, from the taxied plane to waiting vehicles.

Geneva
 prosecutor Olivier Jornot said Swiss federal authorities were 
investigating the hijacking and would press charges which could carry a 
prison sentence of up to 20 years.

Geneva airport was initially closed to other flights, but operations resumed around two hours after the hijacked plane landed.

‘We hope everything will return to normal in the afternoon,’ Mr Deillon added.

The flight apparently began emitting a 'hijacking code' as it flew over Sudan and this was picked up by aviation site Airlinereporter.com.

It tweeted in the early hours of Monday morning: 'Ethiopian Airlines’ Flight 702 Squawks “HiJacking” for Reasons Unknown.'

It reported that this beacon, known as a '7500', cannot come from a glitch.

The website said that the co-pilot kept the plane in the air over Switzerland and France until his asylum request was mentioned.

Ethiopian Airlines is owned by Ethiopia's government, which has faced persistent criticism over its rights record and alleged intolerance for political dissent.

Human Rights Watch says Ethiopia's human rights record 'has sharply deteriorated' over the years.

The rights group says authorities severely restrict basic rights of freedom of expression, association, and assembly.

The government has been accused of targeting journalists, opposition members, as well as the country's minority Muslim community.
