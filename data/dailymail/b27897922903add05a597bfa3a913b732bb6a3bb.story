A paramedic refused to give a heart attack victim the drugs that could have saved his life.

Doctors believe that 61-year-old Grahame Giles could have survived if he had been given drugs by Brian Jewers, the paramedic who was treating him.

A second inquest into the Mr Giles's death exposed a 'failure in care,' according to Coroner Tony Brown.

Brian Jewers, 
who worked for the North East Ambulance Service, was struck off 
following the incident in 2008.

However, Mr Giles’ widow Marion, now 66, was only informed about the details of her husband's death 
following an investigation by Sky News.

Speaking at today's inquest in Alnwick, Northumberland, Mrs Giles said: 'I should have been told what had happened to my husband at the start. I was entitled to know the truth.

The second inquest into Grahame Giles' death concluded that Brian Jewers and the Ambulance Service missed an opportunity to provide better care

'The hardest thing to come to terms with was to hear three years after my husband died that the truth had all been hushed up.

'That was very deceitful. I thought it was horrendous that they could have done that to me.

'I was just getting over his death when I
was told that perhaps he could have lived if this paramedic had done 
his job properly. It was an awful shock.'

The inquest heard that the failure of 
the North East Ambulance Service to tell Mrs Giles about the circumstances of her husband’s death, in March 2008, was due to a breakdown in 
communications.

It also heard that the risk and claim 
department within the trust was not aware of the investigation into
Mr Jewers' actions until three years after the incident.

A second inquest into the death was opened after a previous coroner was not made aware of all the facts of the case.

Coroner Tony Brown said: 'There was a clear missed opportunity to provide more suitable medical care by the paramedic.

'This failure in care was also a failure in care provided by Brian Jewers’ employers the North East Ambulance Service.'

The inquest heard that Mr Jewers was asked to attend a course to give him the relevant training but he declined.

Katie Gollop, representing the Trust, said that as a result he was not qualified to make the decision to administer the drug but in this case he had been instructed to do so by a doctor.
