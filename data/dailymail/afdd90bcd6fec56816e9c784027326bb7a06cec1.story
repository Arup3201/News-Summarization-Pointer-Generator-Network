Paul Lambert has signed a new contract at Aston Villa that will keep him at the club until at least June 2018.

The deal has been struck with Villa second in the Premier League following an unbeaten start to the season.

Lambert’s current contract runs out at the end of the campaign and his extension follows fresh terms for Gabriel Agbonlahor and Alan Hutton.

Paul Lambert signs new Aston Villa contract that will keep him at club until 2018

A new three-year deal was originally discussed back in February but was put on the back-burner as Villa fought for their top-flight survival.

American owner Randy Lerner put the club up for sale once last season was finished but has been re-energised over the summer and is making arrangements for the long-term future of Villa.

He shares a strong relationship with Lambert, who moved from Norwich in 2012 and was tasked with streamlining the playing budget.

‘This is a massive football club, a fantastic football club,’ said Lambert. ‘I knew the first two years would be tough but we've made progress and now we're beginning to see the benefits of all of that hard work.

Aston Villa's young side are, so far, undefeated in the Premier League this season

‘We're in a much healthier position on and off the pitch and, with a continued sensible approach, we believe we're on the right road to build upon the strong start we've made this season in the Barclays Premier League.

‘The bar had to be raised, everyone has stepped up and there will be continued improvement.

‘We can look to the future with real optimism and a determination to make this season successful, and the seasons that follow.

‘On a personal note I'd like to express my thanks to the chairman for his continued support and to the fans who have been really supportive towards myself, the staff and, most importantly, the team.’

Gabby Agbonlahor and Alan Hutton have also signed contract extensions with the club

New chief executive Tom Fox added: ‘I am delighted that we have extended manager Paul Lambert's contract to the end of the 2017-18 season.

‘Paul and Randy had been in discussions regarding this move when I came on board and we concluded our agreement last week.

‘We have a long-term vision for Villa and Paul is completely integrated into our plan to manage the club carefully and ambitiously back to a position in the Barclays Premier League appropriate to our history and collective expectations.’
