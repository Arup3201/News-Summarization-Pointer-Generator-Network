He may be used to sitting in the cockpit of airplanes, standing on the bow of ocean liners or arriving by stretched limo, but Leonardo DiCaprio isn't too posh to push.

The star of 'Gatsby' was seen cycling around New York's trendy SoHo neighborhood with a friend.

The bike share scheme kicked off in the Big Apple recently and for $10 a day allows New Yorkers the chance to pedal their way around the city.

Some 16,000 people having signed up to become annual members for $95 a year.

DiCaprio, 38, who owns an apartment in Battery Park City, was seen riding on the sidewalk for some of his journey which can sometimes result in a ticket being issued.

Most New Yorker's probably wouldn't blame him - it might feel just that tiny bit safer being out of harms way than in the busy Manhattan streets.

Citibikes launched in New York at the end of May by the city's Mayor Michael Bloomberg and have not been without controversy.

Riders have complained of difficulties getting the bikes in and out of their racks because the cycles are so heavy.

There have been numerous complaints about the smartphone app not functioning correctly.

A number of the docking stations have been ripped out after some of Manhattan's wealthier residents complained the racks were ugly and would lower property values.

Safety first: Leo plus his companion wait to cross the road. The bikes have only been in New York for a month and it is taking a while to get used to seeing them everywhere

Popular: The bikes have proven to be fairly successful in the first month. Cyclists have taken more than 528,000 trips

Many are also adamant they don't want the docking stations cluttering the streets and spoiling the look of their neighborhoods.

At least 10 stations for the bike share scheme have been removed since the scheme began.

Some stations were striped from streets after legal threats and neighborhood petitions but others required a simple phone call for wealthy stakeholders to make the bikes disappear.

The bikes have also taken up space in a city where space is at a premium. The racks occupy parking spaces and have even displaced food vendors such as hot dog stands.

The city has even stubbornly refused to 
remove a station outside Frank's Bike Shop on the Lower East Side 
despite 1,000 people signing a petition claiming the rack's placement 
will kill off business for the independent store.

DiCaprio may have had the idea for a bike ride whilst filming his latest flick, 'The Wolf of Wall Street'.

Part of the upcoming Martin Scorsese movie was shot in the $3.7 million penthouse at the 31-storey Milan Condominium on East 55th Street and Second Avenue.

A 29-bike station was located outside the swanky building but has since been moved at the requests of the wealthy residents.
