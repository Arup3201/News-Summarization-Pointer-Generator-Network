Ill: The Queen, pictured touring the Royal London Hospital in east London on Thursday, has cancelled a visit to Swansea because she is suffering from gastroenteritis

The Queen has been forced to cancel a visit to Wales today after being struck down with suspected gastroenteritis.

The monarch was due  to attend a military celebration in Swansea as part  of the city’s St David’s Day celebrations.

But a Buckingham Palace spokesman said she will instead spend the weekend at Windsor, and will be assessed by doctors in the coming days.

The Queen, 86, was due to spend three hours in Swansea meeting soldiers and their families before a lunch at the George Hall.

She had also planned to present St David’s Day leeks to members of 3rd Battalion The Royal Welsh Regiment.

The ceremony will continue in her absence, but will now instead be carried out by the Lord Lieutenant of West Glamorgan, Byron Lewis.

A council spokesman said: ‘The Lord Lieutenant will be met upon arrival at the Guildhall by Brigadier Philip Napier, Colonel of the Regiment.

‘The parade will present arms for a royal salute and play the national anthem before the Lord Lieutenant is invited to present leeks to a representative body of the regiment.

‘Following the parade, the Lord Lieutenant will attend a reception with members of the battalion and their families, before proceeding to the George Hall for lunch.’

The Queen has rarely taken time off due to illness during her six decades as monarch.

She is normally in robust health and is known not to make a fuss in times of sickness or discomfort.

She has, however, suffered occasional problems with her back. In October, she was forced to cancel an appearance at a Windsor Castle investiture ceremony, and also had to miss a church service in Scotland a few days earlier.

Host: The Queen was well enough to award Jessica Ennis a CBE and Nicola Adams an MBE at the Investiture ceremony on Thursday, but has since taken a turn for the worse

In 2006, she suffered a strain to her 
back during her annual summer break at Balmoral which led to her 
cancelling a tour of Arsenal’s new stadium.

She also missed a visit to the British Museum in October 2011 because of a bad cold.

Disappointed locals took to Twitter 
last night to voice their upset at today’s change of plans. Becca 
Masters commented ‘poor Queenie’ while Peter Grant added ‘Get well soon 
your Majesty!’

June Marcroft added: ‘Jeez, she’s human after all, I thought she was bionic.’

Honoured: Olympic cycling coach David Brailsford received a Knighthood at The Queen's Investiture ceremony

Strong: Her Majesty has always refused to fuss over a string of ailments over recent years

Leaders: Although the Queen has suffered various illness and injury in recent years, it is the health of Prince Philip that is more often in the spotlight

The Queen’s most recent appearance was
to present a host of Olympic stars with honours during an investiture 
ceremony at Buckingham Palace on Thursday.

She and the Duke of Edinburgh are scheduled to fly out to Rome for a two-day visit next week.

A Palace spokesman said the trip was 
still due to take place but a decision would be made after the Queen is 
assessed in the next few days.

Gastroenteritis is an infection of the stomach and bowel, with common symptoms including vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration.

In England, the two most common causes
of gastroenteritis in adults are the norovirus and food poisoning, 
according to NHS Choices.

In June, the Duke of Edinburgh 
succumbed to a bladder infection thought to be brought on after being 
forced to stand for several hours in cold, wet and windy conditions on a
barge sailing down the Thames during the Jubilee River Pageant.

The 91-year-old was taken into 
hospital just hours  before the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee’s closing 
celebrations at Buckingham Palace,  where she was joined by some 12,000 
people.

The illness forced him to miss several other key events, including a service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral.

Gastroenteritis is an infection of the stomach and bowel and is very common in England, with about one in five people affected every year.

The two most common causes in adults are a virus, such as the norovirus, or food poisoning, according to NHS Choices.

The infection interferes with one of the main functions of the intestines, the absorption of water from the contents of the intestines into the body.

Common symptoms of gastroenteritis include vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration. Most types of gastroenteritis are highly infectious, and bacteria can be transferred through poor hygiene, such as not washing your hands after going to the toilet.

Viruses and bacteria on hands can be transferred to whatever they touch, such as a glass, kitchen utensil or food. Most people with gastroenteritis only have mild symptoms and the infection passes after a few days without the need for treatment.

But sufferers may need treatment in hospital if symptoms are severe or if they are vulnerable because of their age or another illness. This is because diarrhoea can quickly cause dehydration which, if severe, can be fatal.

Each year in England and Wales, an average 190 deaths occur because of gastroenteritis. Most deaths are in people over 65.

Worrying: It is unknown at this time whether The Queen will be well enough to travel to Rome next week
