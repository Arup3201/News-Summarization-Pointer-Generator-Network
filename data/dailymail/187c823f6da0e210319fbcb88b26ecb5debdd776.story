Being rejected by a woman on Valentine’s Day can be a disheartening experience. Being rejected by an entire city and you can understand why a man would lose faith in the fairer sex.

In a hilarious video, musician DJ Lubel bemoans the women of LA and how they keep turning him down because he is ‘not Pauly Shore’.

However, thanks to his tongue-in-cheek response to his lack of luck in love going viral, he might find his leading lady after all.
