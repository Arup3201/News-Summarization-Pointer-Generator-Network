The median household income for Americans living in Washington DC in 2013 was $66,583.

But according to a new graph, you would have to earn $688,000 a year in order to be considered among the top 1 percent of earners in the state.

Business Insider have used the 2012 American Community Survey to calculate how much a household would have to make in order to be considered among the elite of their state.

While some business pundits say the results are surprisingly low, given the amount of billionaires living in the United States, the map illustrates a giant gap between the rich and middle-class America.

Do you qualify? This map, put together by Business Insider using figures from the the 2012 American Community Survey, estimates what residents of each state would have to earn in order to be considered among the top 1 percent. Washington D.C. topped the list with $688,000, while Idaho came in at the bottom, with their elite needed at least $274,000

Washington D.C. topped the estimates.

Other cities on the east coast also proved to earn big, with Connecticut coming in at $642,000 and New York $511,000.

The west coast calculated slightly lower, with California's upper echelons earning at least $433,000.

Further up, oil rich North Dakota came in at an impressive $455,000, one of the highest in the country.

Down south, states like Texas and Louisiana came in much lower, with $391,000 and $335,000 respectively.

The lowest of the high earners were found in Idaho, where residents earning $274,000 made the top 1 percent.

Despite the calculations, New York accounts for nearly one-quarter of all the wealth of all 'high net worth individuals' in the US, according to Vox.

That's more like it: The Census Bureau reported earlier this month that the median household income in 2013 was $51,939

The average U.S. one-percenter would have to earn at least $368,549 using the figures on the map, according to The Houston Chronicle.

However Business Insider stressed the figures should be taken as estimates.
