A man from Ohio who wanted to have sex with a family including two young girls has been jailed for six years.

Timothy Rogers, 25 from Akron, put an advert on Craiglist saying he was looking to share a ‘taboo’ experience with members of the same family.

The post was spotted by a detective with the Ohio Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, who posed as a man with a six-year-old and 12-year-old daughter, according to 19 Action News.

The investigator began communicating with Rogers about possible sexual activity between Rogers and the two girls.

Rogers expressed interest in observing the girls engaging in sexual activity and then having sex with them and the girls’ father.

He arranged to meet the ‘father’ at a restaurant on December 30 and then to go to a nearby hotel.

The two men met as planned, but when Rogers followed the investigator to the hotel, he was arrested in the car park.
