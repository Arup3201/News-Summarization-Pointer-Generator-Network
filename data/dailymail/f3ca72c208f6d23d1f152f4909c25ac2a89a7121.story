Cardiff city centre has been turned into a high security ‘prison’ with 10 miles of fencing - which is being dubbed the ‘ring of steel’ - ahead of the Nato conference next week.

Police have erected the nine feet high security fencing around Celtic Manor resort in Newport where Barack Obama, David Cameron and other world leaders will meet in Wales on September 4 and 5, as well as the city centre.

It comes as former foreign office minister, Kim Howells, issued fears that home grown Islamic State terrorists could be planning to attack the 2014 summit.

Cardiff city centre resembles a high security ‘prison’ with its 10 miles of fencing - dubbed the ‘ring of steel’ - put up ahead of the Nato conference in Wales next week

The nine feet tall fencing surrounds roads leading to the centre of Cardiff as well as Celtic Manor resort in Newport where the world leaders including Obama will meet

Mounted police officers patrol the security fence in front of Cardiff Castle ahead of the conference, which will see patrols increased to 9.500 officers from across UK

He said: 'It will be a target, there is no question about it, that is why the security measures taken are so intense.

'With a Nato summit there is going to be a raised expectation or raised awareness that there might be an attack - that is why all the special measures have been taken.’

More than 9,000 officers from across the UK have been drafted in to police the event, which will be attended by 150 heads of state along with thousands of support staff and journalists.

But with eight miles of fencing surrounding the Newport resort and three miles in and around Cardiff city centre, Gwent Police are preparing for traffic disruptions.

 

People pass through a pedestrian gate that has been installed in the security fence, which is likely to cause traffic chaos when event begins on September 4 and 5

The barriers have been erected as former foreign office minister, Kim Howells, issued fears that home grown Islamic State terrorists could be planning to attack summit

A spokesperson from the force said: ‘Due to the sheer size and scale of the summit some disruption is inevitable, however, we will be working with the organisers and doing all we can to minimise this.’

It is not yet known how much the bill for security will cost but it is expected to be published by the Government after the event.

Gwent Police say the costs will be met by Nato and No.10 Downing Street – which is leading the event - but opponents have predicted it could cost in the region of £50million, according to the South Wales Argus.

Protesters are expected to arrive in the city this week for a peace camp at Tredegar Park and demonstrations are scheduled for August 30 and September 4.

The total cost for the security operation is not yet known but is expected to be published by the Government after the event, with costs met by them and Nato

Newport City Council is encouraging people to plan their travel, noting that the main pinch points will be around the rush hours on Thursday evening and Friday morning

The summit is expected to be the largest gathering of international leaders ever to take place in Britain with leaders and senior ministers from around 60 countries

Gwent Police say the event is likely to attract individuals and organisations who will be intent on protesting and no restrictions will be placed on those in peaceful protest

Protesters are expected to arrive in the city this week for a peace camp at Tredegar Park and demonstrations are scheduled for August 30 and September 4

The summit being held in Wales comes as Nato draws down from its longest ever mission in Afghanistan and against a backdrop of instability in Ukraine

The barriers have been put up as part of security measures to protect the 150 heads of state along with thousands of support staff and journalists

Opponents have predicted the security operation could cost in the region of £50million for No.10 Downing Street and Nato - who are said to be footing the bill
