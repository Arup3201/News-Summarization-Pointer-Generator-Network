Three men wheeling the body of a brutally murdered 22-year-old man down a road in a wheelie bin were confronted by police - who told them to put it back before driving off, a court heard today.

Two police officers in a patrol car allegedly failed to notice the lifeless body of Jamie Dack, who had been repeatedly stabbed and beaten with a rounders bat in Southampton, Hampshire, in April.

Andrew Dwyer-Skeats, 26, Lee Nicholls, 28, and Ryan Woodmansey, 32, were told off for stealing the bin - and Mr Dack’s body was later doused with petrol and set alight in a skip, the court was told.

Victim: Two police officers in a patrol car failed to notice the lifeless body of Jamie Dack (pictured), who had been repeatedly stabbed and beaten with a rounders bat in Southampton, Hampshire, in April, a court heard

His remains were found by firefighters
 a short while later as they tackled the blaze in a nearby industrial estate 
in the early hours of Easter Sunday, Winchester Crown Court was told.

The group brutally attacked Jamie with
 kitchen knives and broken bottles in a bid to get his bank card PIN, 
before killing him to stop him going to the police, prosecutors claim.

Their escape was revealed in a 
prepared court statement by Dwyer-Skeats, who allegedly stepped into a 
fight between Nicholls and Mr Dack after the young man ‘tried it on’ 
with Nicholls’s girlfriend.

The pair separated and shook hands, 
remaining in their friends’ Southampton flat. Dwyer-Skeats, Woodmansey 
and friend Donna Chalk, 21, left to go on a night out in Bournemouth, 
Dorset, he said.

When Dwyer-Skeats and Chalk returned, 
he said he found Nicholls in the flat with Mr Dack’s body lying on the 
kitchen floor, covered by a duvet - and both Nicholls and the duvet were 
blood stained.

There was also blood on the carpet and
 walls. Dwyer-Skeats said he tried to find a pulse and Nicholls told 
him: ‘I couldn’t let him grass me up.’ He suggested they called the 
police but Nicholls refused.

Dwyer-Skeats said he and Chalk were 
panicking and Nicholls pleaded with them to ‘clean the place up or 
you’re going to get the same’. Dwyer-Skeats said he took the threat 
seriously.

He said: ‘I knew he had murdered Jamie. I couldn’t think straight - it was like a dream.’

They decided to get rid of the body, 
the court heard. Dwyer-Skeats and Woodmansey found two wheelie bins - 
one for Mr Dack’s body and the other for the blood-stained carpet.

They were said to have been on their way to the industrial estate when the police stopped them and told them to put the bins back.

After the officers left, the trio 
allegedly carried on to the estate, where Woodmansey helped Nicholls tip the body 
into the skip. It was then covered with petrol and set on fire, the court heard.

Dwyer-Skeats said: ‘I ran as soon as I
 put the carpet in - straight back to the flat, followed by Lee and 
Ryan. Donna was still there.’

Dwyer-Skeats told detectives that he 
overheard Nicholls phoning his girlfriend, telling her: ‘I’ve done it 
for you.’ His statement ended: ‘Myself, Ryan and Donna had no part in 
the murder of Jamie Dack.

‘I greatly regret helping Lee after I saw the body. I was put under pressure.’

Dwyer-Skeats, Nicholls, Woodmansey and
 Chalk all deny murdering Mr Dack.

The three men have admitted 
perverting the course of justice by disposing of and setting fire to his
 body. Chalk denies that charge.

The trial continues.
