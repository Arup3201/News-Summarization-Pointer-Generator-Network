A 23-stone mother-of-one has lost more than half her body-weight after taking up bodybuilding – and is now training for a modelling competition.

Amy Champion, 25, from Pontypridd, south Wales, once struggled to fit into size 20 clothes, and could not walk up stairs without getting out of breath.

She piled on the pounds after falling pregnant with her daughter Annwyn, now two, using it as 'an excuse' to eat for two, scoffing on chocolate, biscuits and fizzy drinks.

After joining a gym, Amy, who is a salon management student and is married to Sam, 26, discovered she had a knack for lifting weights and has now lost an incredible 12 stone, dropping to a size 8.

Now the 5ft 10in weight-lifter, who was bullied and called a 'whale' because of her size, says she has never felt more confident about her body.

Amy said: 'I'd always been big, and when I found out I was pregnant with my daughter, I started eating for two.

'I'd have a bacon sandwich for breakfast, followed by a sausage roll for lunch and then a massive pizza for tea. And throughout the day, I'd munch on chocolate, crisps and biscuits.

'Looking back, I can't believe how much I actually ate.'

As Amy's weight soared to 23st, strangers began to stare and whisper and she also heard through friends that people referred to her as a 'whale'.

She became self-conscious about her appearance and began to shun social events in favour of nights in front of the TV with her police officer husband.

TEA: Chicken stir fry

SNACKS: Fruit

Amy said: 'I used my pregnancy as an excuse to avoid going out with my friends. The truth was that I was ashamed of myself.

'Even simple things like family barbeques were a nightmare, as I couldn't fit into the plastic chairs.

'Sam was always telling me how beautiful he thought I was, but it didn't make any difference.

'It was a vicious cycle. I hated the way I looked, but I just couldn't stop eating.'

The turning point for Amy came in June 2012, when she gave birth to her daughter.

Amy said: 'I'd been told by doctors that I'd never have children because of cysts on my ovaries. So when Annwyn was born, it was our own little miracle.

'She was absolutely perfect. As I held her in my arms, I promised myself that I would never let her grow up to be as ashamed of her body as I was of mine.

'I knew that after years of denying I had a problem, it was finally time to face my demons and build a happy, healthy future for me and my family.'

Determined to set a good example, Amy joined a gym and threw out all of the junk food from her cupboards.

Instead of scoffing on chocolate and takeaways, she began a healthy diet that included plenty of fruit and vegetables, and worked out with a personal trainer up to five times per week.

Amy said she swapped her unhealthy diet for one that included more fruit and veg and started weightlifting

She said: 'My first trip to the gym was absolutely mortifying. I had to walk slowly on the treadmill in case my flab jiggled, and by the end of the hour I was dripping in sweat.

'But I was proud that I had stuck to it, so I kept on going back. In time, I realised that I actually really enjoyed working out - especially lifting weights.

'I liked the challenge of pushing myself more each time, and every time I improved, I felt a sense of achievement.

'This really spurred me on to continue losing the weight.'

Amy's dedication to the gym paid off, and over the next 18 months, she lost an incredible 12st - taking her down to a svelte 11st.

Now a size 8, Amy is even training for a fitness modelling competition, where she will parade her bikini body in front of hundreds of people.

Amy said: 'Two years ago, I could never have believed that I would be doing anything like this. I hated my body, and didn't want anyone to see it.

'I've worked really hard to get where I am and I'm the happiest I've ever been. Best of all, I know I'm setting a good example for Annwyn.

'I'll never go back to being the size I was. Now that I've swapped biscuits for biceps, I'm in the best shape of my life.'
