Hundreds have been killed over the weekend as more fierce fighting marred a supposed ceasefire in Syria.

Jets yesterday bombed parts ofÂ  the capital Damascus held by anti-government forces, while gun battles raged around the country.

Although a UN-backed truce was called for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, which ends today, fighting was reported from the start on Friday.

Activists said more than 150 people were killed on Friday and more than 120 on Saturday. The figures were on par with previous daily tolls.

At least one rebel-linked radical Islamic group, Jabhat al-Nusra, rejected the truce.

Opponents of President Bashar al-Assad say they will not negotiate for a peaceful resolution until he resigns.

Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center think tank said: 'This conflict has now taken a dynamic of its own which should be worrying to everyone.'

Activists said at least 110 people were killed on Sunday, a toll similar to previous daily casualty tolls. They include 16 who died in an airstrike on the village of al-Barra in northern Syria's mountainous Jabal al-Zawiya region.

The Observatory also reported a car bomb that exploded in a residential area in the Damascus neighborhood of Barzeh and wounded 15 people, but the target was not immediately clear.

Though Syria's death toll has topped 35,000, the bloodiest and most protracted crisis of the Arab Spring, the West has been wary of intervening.

There is concern about sparking a wider conflagration because Syria borders Israel and is allied with Iran and the powerful Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

There are already increasing incidents of the civil war spilling across borders.
