Dismissive: David Cameron said he though we 'should stick to our non-horse eating habits'

David Cameron yesterday dismissed a suggestion by Princess Anne that Britons should start eating horsemeat.

The Prime Minister, who like the Princess Royal is an enthusiastic rider, said he was ‘not keen’ on the idea.

Princess Anne this week argued that Britain should consider eating horsemeat as they do in France, to improve standards of care for the animals.

At the annual conference of World Horse Welfare, of which she is president, she said those in the trade ‘value their horses and look after them well’, adding: ‘Should we be considering a real market for horsemeat and would that reduce the number of welfare cases? I think this needs a debate.’

But when Mr Cameron was asked whether he thought the UK should embrace horse fillet steaks – a French delicacy - he appeared to turn up his nose at the idea.

He said: ‘I’m not keen on eating horse. I know it’s something that happens in other countries but I think we should stick to our non-horse eating habits.’

Mr Cameron declined to say whether he has eaten horse.

The Prime Minister’s stance puts him at odds with Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who said he would happily eat horse products during the horse meat scandal earlier this year.

Hungry? Princess Anne this week suggested that Britons start to eat horses

Horsemeat was found in a wide range of meat products in supermarkets in January. Findus withdrew lasagnes from the shelves and Tesco found that horsemeat accounted for approximately 29 per cent of the meat in its Everyday Value beef burgers.

The discoveries led to a report by the  Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committee which recommended that for trust in the frozen meat sector to be restored, those responsible for the scandal should be identified and prosecuted.

However, to date no one has ever been punished.
