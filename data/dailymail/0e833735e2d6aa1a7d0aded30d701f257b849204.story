The killer of Anni Dewani, murdered on her honeymoon in South Africa four years ago, is critically ill in hospital, it emerged today.

Xolile Mngeni is serving a life sentence for her murder in Cape Town in 2010, while she honeymooned in the city with her husband Shrien, 33.

Mngeni - whose trial was delayed for surgery to remove a brain tumour - was admitted to Groote Schuur Hospital on Tuesday and is said to be in a 'serious and critical condition'.

Xolile Mngeni, the man who murdered Anni Dewani on her honeymoon in Cape Town in 2010, is critically ill in hospital, it has been revealed

Mngeni's trial was delayed after he was diagnosed with pineoblastoma, a rare form of cancer with a very low survival rate. Doctors will not say if his latest illness is related to the cancer

Simphiwe Xako, spokesman for the Department of Correctional Services, said: 'He was transferred from the correctional services centre to the hospital. The doctors said he's in a critical condition.'

Xako refused to comment further on Mngeni's illness, or say whether it was related to his previous battle with cancer.

Mngeni was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2011 and underwent an operation, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

A Groote Schuur Hospital report submitted during Mngeni's trial showed that he was suffering from pineoblastoma, a rare form of cancer with a low survival rate.

Jeanette Parkes, head of the hospital's radiation oncology department, cautioned at the time that if the tumour recurred, treatment options would be limited.

Anni Dewani was killed shortly after marrying Shrien Dewani (left) who was extradited to South Africa in April to face trial accused of ordering the murder

But according to South African news reports, a scan in late 2012 appeared to show the cancer had been successfully treated.

Mngeni was first incarcerated at Pollsmoor Prison before he was moved to Brandvlei Prison, which has better medical facilities.

Shrien Dewani was extradited in April to stand trial, accused of ordering his wife's killing.

He denies any involvement in his wife's murder and was sent to hospital for psychiatric observation ahead of the trial, which comes before court again on June 20.

Her body was found with a single gunshot wound to the neck after she and her husband were kidnapped while travelling in a taxi through the outskirts of Cape Town.

Three men, including Mngeni, have already been convicted in connection with Mrs Dewani's death.
