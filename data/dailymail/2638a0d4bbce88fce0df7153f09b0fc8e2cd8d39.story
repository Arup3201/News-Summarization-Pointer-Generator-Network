Angry: Texas doctor Angela Siler-Fisher, pictured, has been accused of breaking into the home of her husband's alleged mistress and scrawling 'wh***' and 'homewrecker' in lipstick on her bathroom mirror

A Texas doctor has been accused of breaking into the home of her husband's alleged mistress, scrawling 'wh***' and 'homewrecker' in lipstick on her bathroom mirror and littering her staircase with condoms.

Angela Siler-Fisher also allegedly phoned the other woman, Marcelle Mallery, threatening to 'beat her f***ing a** wh***' and 'dislocate her vagina' and then proceeded to send her 25 text messages over the next 16 hours, including one with a photo of her bedroom.

The 42-year-old mother-of-two, who reportedly forcibly entered the property through the doggy door, is charged with criminal trespass and harassment in the apparently 'out of character' outburst that occurred Sunday.

The alleged mistress, a 35-year-old radiologist, received a phone call from Siler-Fisher's husband, Brandon Fisher, 43, also a radiologist, warning her that his furious wife was on her way.

The Mallery told police she then left her home with her children before Siler-Fisher arrived.

Video surveillance cameras reportedly captured the irate doctor entering and leaving the two-story house, which is in an upscale Houston neighborhood.

Siler-Fisher is the medical director at Ben Taub Hospital's Emergency Center and is also a professor at Baylor College of Medicine, where her romantic rival went to college.

She lives less than three miles from where she allegedly committed the crime.

Neighbor and friend, Chris Pancheri, 
told KHOU.com he was shocked at the allegations against the doctor and 
said she must have had good reason to snap.

'Other woman': Marcelle Mallery, pictured, is allegedly having an affair with Siler-Fisher's husband, Brandon

'She's probably the most sane person in this neighborhood that I know,' he said. 'She's an extraordinary doctor from what I know, great wife and mother. She's a great woman.'

Pancheri added: 'Most people's reaction would be a lot bigger than that one. I thought the other woman got off easy.'

Siler-Ficher was taken into custody but has since posted bond. She is scheduled to be arraigned in Harris County District Court on December 11, according to The Smoking Gun.

A spokesman for Bayor College said in a statement: 'We understand that this is a private matter for Dr. Fisher and does not impact her work at Baylor College of Medicine.'Â
