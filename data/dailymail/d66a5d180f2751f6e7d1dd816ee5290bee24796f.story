Liverpool starlet Joao Carlos Teixeira continues to impress on loan at Brighton and Sami Hyypia has tipped the 21-year-old for big things.

Hyypia, who made 450 appearances for Liverpool, praised Teixeira and has instructed his Brighton team to give the player as much time on the ball as possible.

He insisted that Teixeira could wreak havoc around the box if Brighton can set him up in crucial areas on the pitch.

Future prospect:  Brendan Rodgers sent the 21 year-old out on loan but he could one day be a star at Anfield

Delight: Teixeira's scored two goals in three appearances for Brighton and Hyypia insists there's more to come

Joao Carlos Teixeira is improving with every match he plays and has scored two goals in three appearances so far, including the winning goal against Bolton

Hyypia said: 'I hope he takes the advantage to play for us; normally loan deals work both ways, in that we give him the opportunity to play at this level.

'I think our style of play suits him as well. From our point of view, we can have a very good player on our side. He has a good mentality, is training well and we can push him to improve himself.

'We need quality from the other players so that we can get him on the ball in dangerous areas and he can score goals. I think when we can get him on the ball around the box, he will be dangerous there.'
