A 12-year-old eastern Pennsylvania girl who was swept hundreds of yards through a flooded drainpipe is home from hospital with bumps and bruises.

Taylor Russell, of Frackville, says she was checking out flooding at the drainpipe late Monday when she was swept away.

She didn't notice a drop in the ground and got pulled under. Her friends saw her get swept under and immediately alerted firefighters.

It was 'just scary, dark, scary', she told WNEP-TV. She says she held her breath the whole time and was afraid she would drown.

'I was swooped under and I tried to look back and see if my sister was there. I was trying to yell and I couldn't because I didn't want to open my mouth', she said.

Police and public works officials told The Republican-Herald in Pottsville the girl was underground in the pipe for about 200 yards before emerging into Little Mahanoy Creek.

She was washed several hundred more yards downstream before her rescue.

The girl says she came out of the pipe thinking, 'somebody pinch me, I'm still alive.'

Taylor lost her mother to cancer last year and she said her mom helped her through.

'I was thinking of everyone, my dad, my mom, my new mom, my sisters and my brothers. I was just praying that I would make it through', Taylor said.

Frackville Assistant Fire Chief, Bill Lindemuth, said that everyone needs to be careful near flooded areas.

'That's the best bet, stay away from the water', he told PAHomepage.com

'Don't play in it. Don't drive through it. The best is to just stay away', he said.
