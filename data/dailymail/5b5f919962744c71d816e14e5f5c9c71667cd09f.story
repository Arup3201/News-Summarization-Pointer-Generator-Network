Nigel Pearson can expect a call from the League Managers’ Association following the verbal exchange with a fan during Leicester’s midweek defeat against Liverpool.

While LMA chief Richard Bevan prepares to get involved, Pearson is armed with the knowledge that both dressing room and boardroom are united behind him as far as the abusive spat is concerned.

The Leicester manager will escape disciplinary action for an incident which is becoming increasingly common in the Premier League, hence Bevan’s interest.

Pearson was targeted by a serial offender, who also picks on players and backroom staff. That is like waving a red flag at a bull as far as the manager is concerned.

It was Pearson’s willingness to jump to their defence which resonated loudest in the dressing room.

‘The lads know that the gaffer is going to back us. He has always backed us,’ said midfielder Matty James.

‘We had a dip in form the first season I was here and he did the same then. He is a lot more scrutinised now in the Premier League, a lot more eyes and ears, but to see your gaffer backing you is a great thing to see.

‘What has happened this week, that’s football and that’s what goes on. The gaffer has shown passion and the fans have shown passion but all of that has to be put to bed now.’

Thai owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who also found himself targeted for criticism by box holders on Tuesday night, is sticking with his manager too – although pressure is building.

Leicester travel to Midlands rivals Aston Villa on Sunday, who are also struggling badly.

Pearson retains the support of the majority of fans despite a dismal winless run of nine games since beating Manchester United 5-3.

That match was also James’s Premier League bow, two years after rejecting a one-year deal with United to drop to the Championship.

James, 23, chose to leave Old Trafford after a 14-month spell on the sidelines with a rare knee injury, which took time to diagnose.

Leicester midfielder Matty James has backed Pearson over his heated exchange with a fan 

He recalled: ‘There were times when I’d have an injection, take the edge off it and a couple of weeks later it would come back. I would go home in tears and it was scary.

‘I eventually had surgery and United offered me a one-year deal. Sir Alex Ferguson was brilliant and told me he didn’t want me to go.

‘It was surreal playing Manchester United in the Premier League as my first match. That win hasn’t got anything to do with this run. People say we got lackadaisical but I don’t think that at all. It has just been learning about this League.”
