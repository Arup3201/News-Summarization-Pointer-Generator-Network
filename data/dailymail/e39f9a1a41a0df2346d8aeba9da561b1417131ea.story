Two drug smugglers who tried to hide cocaine worth £34million in boxes of imported pineapples have been jailed.

Company director Terrance Smith, 58, and unemployed Frederick Colverson, 56, were jailed for a total of 45 years for their part in the biggest ever drugs haul discovered in Suffolk.

The pair were arrested after police raided an industrial unit in Brandon last October.

Officers found 174kg of high-grade cocaine hidden in the bottom of the fruit crates, which had entered the UK through Felixstowe Docks.

Smith's former lover, Anita Kennedy, tipped the police off about the operation by calling the Crimestoppers hotline following their acrimonious split,  Ipswich Crown Court heard.

Smith, of Thetford, Norfolk, admitted on Tuesday to conspiring to supply class A drugs and was jailed for 20 years.

Colverson, of Tower Hamlets, east London, denied the charge but was found guilty at Ipswich Crown Court last month and was jailed for 25 years.

Sentencing the men, Judge John Devaux said Smith's ex-girlfriend had told police about an earlier drugs shipment in January last year.

That was described by Smith and Colverson as "the mother of all loads" and they had expected to make a lot of money.

Judge Devaux said that load had not been seized but he was satisfied it had taken place and had involved a significant amount of cocaine.

The court also heard that in April 2010, Smith had set up 24/7 Import Export (Europe) Ltd and had rented industrial units in Brandon.

He was the sole director and signatory on the company's bank account and between June and October that year, substantial amounts of money had been paid into the account.

Colverson's fingerprints had also been found on documents in the industrial unit and incriminating documents had been found at his home.

The pair's illegal activity finally came to an abrupt end when officers, who had been gathering information for months, swooped on the industrial unit on October 31 last year.

A lorry carrying the massive stash of hidden drugs turned up at the unit and when the cargo was opened, officers heard an "animated reaction", said David Holborn for the prosecution.

In defending Smith, Stephen Spence said he was "a cog in the commercial chain" and was not the organiser or financier of the ambitious money-spinning operation.

Lindsay Cox, for Colverson, said her defendant was in poor health, lived in a terraced house and had a mortgage.

But the pair were found guilty. At sentencing, Judge Devaux said Smith had played a 
leading role in the drugs racket in this country and both men had 
expected to make a lot of cash.

Detective Inspector Benny Benford, of Suffolk Police, said after yesterday's hearing: 'The sentencing at court today emphasises the seriousness of Smith and Colverson's crime and sends out a strong message to those who maybe following the same criminal path.'

He added that the discovery of the haul would have a "significant impact" in disrupting the drugs trade in England.
