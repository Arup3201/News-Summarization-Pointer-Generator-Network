Jayne Copley put on her old nurse uniform and pretended she was on duty to get hold of Tramadol

A former nurse wore her old uniform and carried her ID card to trick hospital staff into handing over strong painkiller Tramadol.

Jayne Copley, 34, pretended to be on duty by putting on her old uniform at Hull Royal Infirmary and duped staff into giving her packets of the drug, claiming they were for patients.

The mother-of-one brazenly walked into two hospital wards, asked for the narcotic-like drugs - which can be highly addictive - and explained they were for a patient in another ward.

But another nurse on duty raised the alarm after she became suspicious and Copley, from Hull in East Yorkshire, was arrested the same day.

She admitted two charges of fraud by false representation yesterday at Hull Magistrates' Court. 

Prosecutor James Byatt said there had been an element of 'pre-planning' by Copley before she went into Wards 4 and 40 on June 9, this year, to obtain the drugs.

'This lady used to be a nurse and she kept her nurse's uniform and identification badge,' he said.

'She was going into Hull Royal Infirmary to one ward saying, "Can I have some Tramadol tablets", claiming they were needed by staff for a patient in Ward 6.

'She wasn't working at the hospital and the ward didn't need the tablets - they were for her.

'She then went into another ward and did the same thing.'

Copley, who has a two-year-old daughter, had told staff she was employed by private health service Bupa but was working at Hull Royal Infirmary as a temporary bank nurse - registered nurses who provide cover to NHS hospitals. 

When Copley was arrested she denied the offences and claimed staff had mistaken her for someone else.

At an earlier hearing, Mr Byatt said: 'I understand Ms Copley is a registered nurse but at the time of these alleged offences she was not working for the NHS or a private company.

'She suggested to various people she was working for Bupa and had signed up on that day as a bank nurse on Ward 6.

'She went into two wards - Ward 4 and 40 - and requested from members of staff there, Tramadol, the painkilling drug.

'It was alleged the drugs were needed by staff for a patient on Ward 6.

'There was not a huge quantity of the drug and the staff say it was being used as a controlled drug to relax the patients.'

Mr Byatt added that she had breached the trust of the other nurses when she made off with almost 70 tablets of the painkiller, which is used to treat moderate to severe pain.

She was caught when another nurse became wary and informed management, who investigated and called the police.

In mitigation for Copley, Michael Miller described the case as 'unusual' but asked for it to be adjourned for pre-sentence reports.

He said: 'It is clearly unusual circumstances and they don't fit neatly into the sentencing guidelines.

'She has no previous convictions and has a two-year-old daughter.

'Clearly there are issues as to the background of this.

'Obviously these drugs were for her own use. I ask for the preparation of a pre-sentence report.'

Russell Moore, the head of security at Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, praised staff for raising the alarm quickly.

He said: 'Fraud committed against the NHS takes vital funds away from our hospitals and the patients we serve.

'In this case, members of hospital staff acted quickly to raise their concerns and we would like to praise them for their part in bringing this case to court.'

Copley pleaded guilty to both charges yesterday and will be sentenced on December 11.

Chair of the bench Peter Robson told Copley: 'We are going to seek reports to be prepared.

'These will assist us in the sentencing and it is in your interest to co-operate.'
