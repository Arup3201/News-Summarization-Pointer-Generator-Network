Grief can play strange tricks on the mind, but a family that lost their son in the Moore tornado in May of this year are convinced they have seen their son since his death.

A photo of a young niece of the McCabe family seems to show their son, Nicholas, appearing in the background.

Their son was amongst seven third-graders who died at Plaza Towers Elementary School when the storm hit, but they are finding comfort in this new picture.

Is it him? It looks like a regular picture of a little girl with a sparkler, but look carefully and behind the youngster you can see the image of a young boy. Scott McCabe believes it to be his son who was killed

Spotted: Little Nichols McCabe,9, was killed when a tornado struck Plaza Towers Elementary school in Moore, Oklahoma in May of this year

Dad: Scott McCabe believe that is it definitely his son that is appearing behind his niece in the photograph

'I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Nicolas loved the Fourth of July and he loved firecrackers,' Scott McCabe told News 9.

The picture that was taken on July 4th showed Nicolas' cousin, Madison, playing with a sparkler.

'My brother, when he saw it, he said the hair stood up on his neck,' Mr McCabe added. 'I was in awe. It touched my heart,'

'It's obviously not Madison. It's obvious there are two people there or one person there and one spirit there.'

Sparkly: Scott McCabe's niece, Madison, was thought to be the only subject in the picture as she played with her sparkler on July 4th, but it appears not to be the case

Living on: The McCabe family began a charity called SOS, Shelter Oklahoma Schools in honor of their precious son Nicholas. The want to see all Oklahoma schools have shelters or safe rooms to protect children during a tornado

From the photo, it is easy to make out two distinct figures with different skin tones and different facial features.

'I feel it, you know. I feel it that he's here,' says dad, Scott.

Nicolas was buried in his red Plaza Towers T-shirt. Mr McCabe said he can make out a red T-shirt on the figure behind Madison.

Of course there are plenty of skeptics and non-believers.

Others have tried to come up with suggestions for the double image with some suggesting it is simply a blurry image of the young girl caused by the phone being shaken.

To dad Scott McCabe, it makes no difference. He knows what he saw.

'They can say what they want. I believe. I believe he's watching over us,' he said.

What once was: The photos of the remains of Plaza Towers Elementary School shows how even the rooms that were spared by the tornado still show major damage

Planning questions: The students were told to hide in the hallway since they had no safe room

On the afternoon of the tornado, there was unimaginable horror at Plaza Towers Elementary School in Moore, Oklahoma as the tornado ripped off the roof on its rampage of destruction, and leveled the building.

The six other children who died were trapped underneath rubble when they were overcome by water from burst pipes.

It was initially reported that the children died from drowning, but officials say the children were suffocated after being crushed by a falling wall.

The elementary school had not built a tornado shelter as they could not afford it.

Despite enduring a devastating tornado that struck the area 14 years ago, most schools in Oklahoma still have no purpose-built shelters.Â

What stayed: Some areas were only barely touched, like this door where all of the class photos remained
