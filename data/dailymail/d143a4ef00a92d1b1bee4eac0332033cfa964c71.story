Sir Winston was described by Mr Paxman as a ‘a ruthless egotist, a chancer, and a charlatan at times’, as well as ‘a parliamentary one-off'

The granddaughter of Sir Winston Churchill has responded furiously to Jeremy Paxman’s suggestion that he would be unelectable in the modern age.

Emma Soames, a journalist, said if the wartime Prime Minister had lived today he would win the public vote with his popular appeal and ‘genuine commitment to ordinary people’.

Sir Winston was described by the former Newsnight presenter as a ‘a ruthless egotist, a chancer, and a charlatan at times’, as well as ‘a parliamentary one-off who’d be suffocated by the spinning and posturing that pass for politics today’. 

Mr Paxman added: ‘Would he be electable now? I fear not.’

But his granddaughter, 65, who was among members of the Churchill family who gathered yesterday for the launch of a series of events to remember his legacy of fighting fascism, said Mr Paxman himself was an ‘egotist’.

‘I just don’t think that’s true’, she said of his remarks. ‘I think Churchill’s virtues were so great…He came from this very ducal background but he felt himself to be very much connected to ordinary people, and I think that was genuine. 

'I don’t think his understanding of them was so great but his consideration for them was immense. 

'I think [Jeremy Paxman] has got it wrong.’

Asked whether he shared any qualities with Boris Johnson, who has written a critically acclaimed book about him called ‘The Churchill Factor’, she said: ‘Yes, journalistically, certainly and wit’.

‘In the same way that Boris (Johnson) is very popular, I think Churchill would be very popular because he had an amazing gift of the gab and a genuine commitment to ordinary people.’

She said her grandfather was ‘a genius and a giant of a man’. 

But she added: ‘It’s certainly true that Churchill was an egotist and I think Jeremy Paxman may easily be one too.’

Her mother Lady Mary Soames was the fifth child of Sir Winston and his wife Clementine, who died last June aged 91, and her brother Nicholas Soames is a Tory MP and former minister.

A week on Friday, on the fiftieth anniversary of his state funeral, surviving family members will board The Havengore, the vessel which carried his coffin down the Thames on its last journey from Tower Bridge to Festival Pier, near the Houses of Parliament.

Leading a small flotilla, it will retrace the route taken on January 30, 1965 – when the funeral was watched on television by an estimated 350 million people worldwide.

His descendants will then lay a wreath in the water near the Palace of Westminster before a special ceremony in Westminster Abbey.

Sir David Cannadine, chair of the ‘Churchill 2015’ commemorations, also attacked Mr Paxman’s remarks, saying: ‘I don’t feel that it advances discussion of Churchill. 

'It seems to me not helpful and I look forward to telling Jeremy that.’

Mr Paxman had been speaking to the Radio Times ahead of a documentary he is presenting, marking the fiftieth anniversary of Sir Winston’s death.

As well as the flotilla, throughout the year commemorative events will be held at his birthplace Blenheim Palace, the Churchill family home at Chartwell in Kent and the Science Museum.

In a tribute read out at the launch yesterday, a message from David Cameron, read by his chief of staff, said: ‘Half a century after his death, Winston Churchill’s legacy continues to inspire not only the nation whose liberty he saved, but the entire world. 

'His words and his actions reverberate through our national life today.

‘2015 is a year to remember Winston Churchill’s extraordinary life of achievement, to admire and to celebrate it anew and to give thanks for his service not only to the country he loved, but to humanity as a whole.’
