A former police community support officer is facing the death penalty after allegedly smuggling drugs into Indonesia in her underwear.

Andrea Waldeck, 43, was arrested by detectives who searched her hotel room and found crystal methamphetamine worth £3,000 taped to her stomach.

After leaving her job as a PCSO last year, Waldeck crossed the globe to become part of an ‘evil conspiracy’ involving an Indonesian drug-smuggling gang, according to prosecutors.

Former Gloucestershire Constabulary PCSO Andrea Waldeck, pictured on the first day of her trial on Monday, is charged with drug trafficking. She faces death by firing squad if found guilty

If found guilty, she will become the 
second British woman facing the firing squad in Indonesia for 
drug-smuggling.

Grandmother Lindsay Sandiford was sentenced to death in 
January after cocaine worth an estimated £1.6millon was found in the 
lining of her suitcase.

Waldeck has told authorities that she 
was ordered to deliver 3lb (1.47kg) of the highly addictive drug, known 
as crystal meth, to Indonesia by her boyfriend.

She is thought to have been living 
with the man, whose nationality is not known, in Dongguan in China 
before flying to Indonesia to meet drug-dealing gangsters.

Waldeck, who was declared bankrupt in 
2009 with debts of more than £120,000, had previously lived  and worked 
in Cheltenham. She left Gloucestershire Police in February last year.

Andrea Waldeck worked as a PCSO for Gloucestershire Constabulary until she left the force in February 2012

Prosecutors say she initially evaded 
customs officials at Juanda Airport while hiding four packets of drugs 
in her underwear.

She was arrested in April at her hotel room in 
Surabaya, Indonesia’s second largest city, after police received a 
tip-off.

Officers raided her room after she rang an associate in China 
to arrange for someone to pick up the crystal meth, it is alleged.

On a Facebook profile, which appears 
to have been set up by Waldeck in July, she apologised to family and 
friends: ‘I’m so very sorry I’ve disappointed you all’.

Last month Indonesia's Supreme Court upheld the death sentence for grandmother Lindsay Sandiford

Prosecutor Deddy Agus Aktavianto said 
Waldeck will face execution by firing squad if convicted, due to the 
quantity of drugs she was allegedly carrying and the likelihood of 
trafficking.

Her trial began this week at Surabaya district court and Waldeck is expected to give a statement next Monday, he said.

Her brother Mark Waldeck, of Brecon, 
Powys, said yesterday: ‘We don’t want to talk about it until the trial 
is over.’ He said his sister is being assisted by London-based legal 
charity Reprieve.

The British Embassy has been aware of Waldeck’s case since shortly after her arrest and has provided consular assistance.
