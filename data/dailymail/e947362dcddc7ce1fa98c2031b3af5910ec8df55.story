An emotional Frank Lampard lingered after the final whistle to say a final farewell to Stamford Bridge  after his Manchester City picked up a 1-1 draw against former club Chelsea in a battle between the Premier League's top two.

Lampard, given a mixed and muted reception by Chelsea fans when he was sent on by City manager Manuel Pellegrini as a 77th-minute substitute, stayed on the pitch after every other player had disappeared down the tunnel to applaud all four corners of the stadium, and his name was chanted by some of the remaining supporters.

The 36-year-old was making his first appearance at Stamford Bridge since leaving Chelsea for City last summer after 13 years as the club's record goalscorer.

Whereas some Chelsea fans were less pleased with Lampard because of his move to Manchester City

With a move to New York City promised at the end of the season, he won't return again unless City are drawn against Chelsea in the latter stages of the Champions League.

‘It was a bit of a strange day for me,' admitted Lampard afterwards. 'I was excited but a bit nervous because of coming back here. As a player here you don’t even think about it but I knew this would be different. but I enjoyed it in the end.

‘I was delighted with the reception from both sets of fans. Chelsea quite rightly get behind their side but they showed their class and I am very thankful for that.’

Lampard got some applause when he came on for Fernando but there were also a few jeers. The vast majority of Chelsea fans it appears simply tried to ignore him, chanting the name of their team as he made his entrance.

But there was a more favourable response when he did his little lap of honour at full-time.

Chelsea, missing key men Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas, took a 41st-minute lead through Costa's replacement Loic Remy but were pegged back before half-time by a David Silva goal.

Their priority after the interval seemed to retain their five-point advantage at the top of the table and Jose Mourinho's men didn't register a single shot in the second half ast they played out a draw.

The Chelsea boss didn't speak afterwards – he still claims there is a campaign against Chelsea and is angry at a three-match ban imposed on Costa for stamping – but midfielder Nemanja Matic claimed the midweek Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool which went to extra-time had an effect.

Matic said: ‘It was a very hard game against Liverpool. We felt a bit tired, especially in the last 20 minutes.

'It was difficult to run with City players because they were more fresh than us. But I am happy because everyone gave 100 per cent if not more.

‘We expected three points today but I think a draw is a fair result. We had some chances and they had some chances.'
