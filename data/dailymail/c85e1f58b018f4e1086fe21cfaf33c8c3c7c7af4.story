A pub refused to serve soldiers as they celebrated their return from fighting in Afghanistan in a parade through the town.

Staff at The Bull  in Romford, Essex, told stunned troops that they were ‘not allowed to serve squaddies’ when the troops tried to order a round after their homecoming march through the town on Tuesday.

The astonishing ban was imposed on the 600-strong 1st Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment, who have lost 16 men in Afghanistan, on the day they paraded through town to mark the end of its final tour of the war-torn country.

The soldiers’ proud families and friends had joined thousands of locals and officials to cheer and salute them in the high-profile Remembrance Day week event.

The tough mechanised infantry unit, famously known as The Vikings, has just been awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Havering.

Outraged Denise Coe, whose son serves in the regiment, criticised the pub in the town’s Market Place, for the sensational snub.

Mrs Coe, of Romford, said: ‘I think it was absolutely disgusting and they should all be ashamed.

‘What is the point of them having the
Freedom of the Borough when the soldiers can’t even go to get a drink 
in a pub in the town?’ 

Christine
Clark, 70, from Romford, was with her grandson, who is in the regiment,
and five of his mates, who had also marched in the stirring ceremony.

She said: ‘There were about 15 soldiers just standing outside the bar and they told us that they wouldn’t serve them.

‘When we went in to the pub they told my grandson and his friends that they “are not allowed to serve squaddies”.

‘When my daughter asked if she could buy the drink for them, they told her that “they are not allowed in”.

‘She insisted: “I felt so embarrassed”.

‘Romford
is my grandson’s hometown and he wanted to take his friends to the pub 
to get a drink and they wouldn’t even serve them.’

A spokesman for The Bull, which dates back to 1890, admitted that soldiers had been banned from the big historic pub.

What's the point? A mother of one of the celebrating troops (pictured) said it was 'absolutely disgusting' and that the pub should be ashamed

He
said: ‘This was a mistake. We absolutely welcome the armed forces into 
The Bull and we apologise for any offence caused to the soldiers.

‘We are talking to the team members involved and clarifying that we welcome the armed forces into the pub.’

Some family and friends were also upset when their spot to watch the parade was blocked by officials.

The parade was due to start at 
12.30pm and many of the soldiers’ loved ones had gathered early to get a
good position but just 10 minutes before the start they claim that 
Havering Council’s special guests were directed to stand in front of 
them, blocking their view.

Sheila Munroe said she had travelled especially from Southend to Romford to support her son and the rest of the regiment.

End of fighting: Troops stand proud in the parade as part of the 600-strong battalion that lost 16 men who were killed while on duty in the war-torn country

Tragically killed: In the latest stint in Helmand Province, Cpl Alex Guy was killed while fighting the Taliban on June 15

Her mother Ellen Fowell, 88, of Barking, also went with her to cheer on the troops.

Ms Munroe said: ‘My mum is in a wheelchair so we got there early just so we could get a good spot.‘It was terrible when these VIPs just came and stood in front of us.

‘She could hardly see anything and all they seemed to be doing was standing and laughing as the parade went on.

‘I was disgusted with the whole thing.

‘The day before we were in Ipswich and we were treated with so much respect.

‘We were expecting the same treatment in Romford but we just didn’t get it.’ 

A Havering Council spokesman apologised for the blunder last night.

He said: ‘We are very sorry if anyone’s view was blocked.

‘We discussed the set-up with the Royal Anglian regiment, including where to place the VIPs.

‘There were thousands of people in Romford to cheer the soldiers home and it was a great day to show our town’s pride in the work that they do.’

Cpl Alex Guy, from the unit, was tragically killed in action fighting the Taliban on June 15 during its latest stint of duty in Helmand Province.
