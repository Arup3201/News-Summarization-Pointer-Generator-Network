Fridge - thrown out. Spectacles - gone. Smartphone - smashed to pieces.

Even his underpants have been banished, not to mention his beloved David Bowie collection.

They are just some of the mod cons and home comforts that Benjamin Carle has dispensed with in his attempt to become 100 per cent French, right down to the coffee he drinks and the films he watches.

Proving a point: French journalist Benjamin Carle poses with some of the items he has bought after setting himself a challenge to use only French-made products

The 26-year-old journalist, who lives in Paris, embarked on the challenge in response to comments made by France's minister for economic renewal Arnaud Montebourg who urged the country to buy French to boost home-grown industry.

But he was shocked to discover that barely 5 per cent of his belongings had been made in France.

He set himself a monthly budget of â‚¬1,800 (Â£1,500) and even took out a bank loan to buy in all his new products, it was reported by The Guardian.

Out went pretty much everything, from the Kenya-grown green beans and the light bulbs from China to his Moroccan-made underpants and his iPhone which he smashed with a Tefal saucepan.

As did the refrigerator, which meant he had to chill his food on a window ledge, and even his Daft Punk music because, although they are French they sing in English.

He was, however, spared having to sling out his girlfriend Anais and pet cat Loon, who are thankfully both French.

After ten months, he had very nearly succeeded, save for a mere 3.1 per cent of non-French products that an 'auditor' ruled he still had in his possession - six Ikea forks, a Chinese guitar and some unsourced wall paint.

Mr Carle said his experiment wasn't designed to be patriotic, but rather to hold politicians to account for the comments they make.

He said: 'This wasn't about French nationalism. It was trying to show that we should think about the way we consume and make different choices.

'If we want to save jobs and industries wherever we are, we might think about supporting them.'

His journey has been filmed for a documentary that is due to be aired on Canal+ this month

At the end, he is presented with a medal... by Montebourg himself.
