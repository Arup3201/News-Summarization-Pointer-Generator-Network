Nearly a year after Jodi Arias was found guilty of brutally murdering her ex-boyfriend, an Arizona jury panel is being asked to decide the fate of another woman charged with an eerily similar crime.

Marissa Suzanne Devault, 36, is accused of bludgeoning her husband with a hammer at their Gilbert, Arizona, home in 2009.

She told investigators that Dale Harrell, 34, had physically and sexually abused her in the past, and that she killed him in self-defense.

Awaiting verdict: Marissa Devault will learn her fate when an Arizona jury returns a verdict  in her murder trial concerning the 2009 killing of her husband

Prosecutors, however, contend the 
January 2009 attack on a sleeping Mr Harrell was premeditated and 
motivated by her desire to obtain an insurance settlement so she could 
pay back her boyfriend the $300,000 she had borrowed.

They
 say the 36-year-old Devault has given conflicting accounts of her 
husband's death and that people who the woman claimed had witnessed some
 of the past abuse didn't back up her claims.

Harrell died at a hospice nearly a month after the attack of complications from his head injuries.

The
 case went to the Maricopa County Superior Court jury Monday, two months 
after the start of the trial, and deliberations resumed this morning.

Dale Harrell, 34: He suffered multiple skull fractures at the couple's home in the Phoenix suburb of Gilbert and died at a hospice nearly a month after the attack of complications from his head injuries

Devault's
 case has been compared to the trial of Jodi Arias, who was found 
guilty of first-degree murder last May for slashing, stabbing and 
shooting to death Travis Alexander in his Mesa, Arizona, home in June 
2008.

Like in the Harrell murder, Arias claimed self-defense, accusing her longtime on-again, off-again lover of being abusive, ABC News reported.

And
 the similarities between the two women do not end there: the cases were
 tried in the same Maricopa County courtroom, and both Arias and Devault
 could face the death penalty.

With their long dark hair and eyeglasses, the two women even look strangely alike.

It
 has been reported that the 36-year-old Devault befriended the 
33-year-old convicted killer while the two were in jail together.

In
 an interrogation video recorded just hours after the bloody attack, 
Devault could be seen chuckling as she recounts the events of the night,
 raising her arm in a motion mimicking hammer blows.

â€˜I saw a hammer go into Darrellâ€™s head,â€™ she says with a nervous smile.

Prosecutor
 Michelle Arino said at the start of the trail in February that Mrs 
Devault needed quick money to get out of her deep financial hole.

But
 one of Devault's attorneys raised questions about the credibility of 
his client's boyfriend, who was given an immunity agreement on child 
pornography allegations in exchange for his testimony.

Authorities said Devault fatally wounded Dale Harrell by bludgeoning him over the head with a hammer as he slept in their suburban Phoenix home in January 2009.

Key witness: Businessman Allen Flores, who was Devault's boyfriend, testified for the prosecution against the woman who owed him $300,000

Harrell, 34, suffered multiple skull fractures and died a month after the attack. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Devault.

Alan Tavassoli, one of Devault's attorneys, said prosecutors are giving a pass to his client's boyfriend, businessman Allen Flores, even after he failed to report to police that Devault had allegedly claimed three days before the hammer attack that her husband had been killed in a tire-iron beating.

At first, Devault told investigators that Harrell had attacked her while she was asleep and choked her until she was unconscious. She told police that when she came to, she saw another man who lived at their Gilbert home beating Harrell with a hammer.

But authorities say blood spatter showed Harrell was alone in the bed at the time of the attack and that bloodstains on Devault's clothes were consistent with a person swinging an object repeatedly over her head.

Marissa Suzanne Devault, 36: She claims killing Dale Harrell was an act of self-defense and told investigators that her husband had physically and sexually abused her in the past

Investigators say Devault later confessed, saying she attacked her sleeping husband in a rage after he had sexually assaulted her.

Police said they discovered Devault had been dating another man, Flores, for more than two years. In a search of Flores' computer, police say they found a journal that appeared to be written from his perspective and indicated that he had given Devault about $7,000, which she used to hire a hit man, according to court records.

The prosecution said Devault needed to repay a $294,000 loan from her boyfriend.

Authorities said child pornography also was found on Flores' computer. County prosecutors granted Flores immunity on that allegation in exchange for his testimony in the murder case.
