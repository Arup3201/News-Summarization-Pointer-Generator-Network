Neil Lennon celebrated success in his first derby match as a manager England as Bolton blew away neighbours Wigan.

Lennon knows a thing or two about local rivalries thanks to his four years in charge of Celtic and whatever he said at half-time in Lancashire did the trick.

Goals from Max Clayton, Craig Davies and Lee Chung-Yong in 15 second-half minutes gave the hosts three points to heap pressure on Wigan boss Uwe Rosler.

Irish winger James McClean, booed for his decision to again not wear a poppy on his shirt, set up Callum McManaman's consolation goal for the visitors as the pressure increased on manager Uwe Rosler.

Rosler has been in charge of Wigan for 11 months and after signs of promise last season, in particular an eight-match winning run in February and March, a better start to his first full campaign in charge was expected.

Lennon has now won four of six matches since taking the helm at Bolton last month.

What his time as Celtic manager did not prepare him for was being at the wrong end of the table.

But Bolton are now above Wigan and out of the relegation – at least until 4.45pm on Saturday.

The problem for both sides has been scoring goals and each of these clubs had scored just 17 goals in 16 matches before kick-off.

Wigan's rotten luck in front of goal was evident twice in the opening ten minutes.

Shaun Maloney should have put the visitors ahead in the third minute after Callum McManaman's accurate chipped cross to the back post but the former Celtic forward volleyed into the turf and wide.

McManaman then went close himself. He drifted in from the left wing and let fly from 30 yards but saw his effort clip the top of the cross bar with Bolton keeper Andrew Lonergan well beaten.

It was a breathless first half, punctuated by moments of fleeting quality. Bolton fashioned their first sight of goal midway through it when Lee Chung-Yong's through ball released Max Clayton but Scot Carson was equal to the shot with a solid save.

Wigan's early menace faded as the half wore on but they sparked back into life in first-half stoppage time when McManaman was unlucky not to put his side ahead.

This time popping up on the right-hand side of the penalty area, the 23-year-old shifted the ball on to his left foot to shoot only to see his low curling effort strike the outside of the post.

Wigan were punished within five minutes of the restart. Clayton headed the ball down to Lee, whose return pass sent the striker clear and his finish through the legs of Carson was befitting of an old pro.

Wigan were punished for their wasted chances as Bolton struck two hammer blows inside the opening ten minutes of the half.

Clayton headed the ball down to Lee, whose return pass sent the striker clear and his finish through the legs of Carson was befitting of an old pro.

Wigan were reeling and the second goal arrived when Liam Feeney's high cross was powered in by Craig Davies' header and Leon Barnett's miserable night got worse when his push on Matt Mills led to a penalty, which Lee converted coolly.

The reception was not welcoming for McClean when he entered the fray as a substitute, but the Derry-born wide player provided a rare moment of quality for the visitors.

His first telling contribution with the ball gave Wigan's fans something to cheer. The Irishman crossed from the left and McManaman finally added a finish that did not come back off the woodwork.

Rosler issued a damning verdict of Wigan's second-half capitulation, calling the performance 'embarrassing' and accusing his own players of giving up.

He said: 'Second half, I have to be honest - Bolton won the game by pure willpower, desire, energy, going to the limit and forcing the issue, forcing the mistakes and forcing the goals - all credit to them.

'We just folded altogether. And for that I have no understanding whatsoever.

'I take responsibility. I'm not blaming anybody but when we analyse the second half, we gave up. I apologise to the chairman, I apologise to the supporters.

'It's very, very seldom in the last 10 years that I had a team who gave up in the way we gave up in the second half.

'I felt embarrassed by the performance that we have given in the second half.

'I'm not sure that meant as much for some of my players as it meant for our supporters and for our chairman.

'In any competitive game of football you never give up, you always fight to the end. To give up at Bolton in the second half in a derby game - it is unforgivable.'

Wigan were leapfrogged by Bolton, who began the evening in the bottom three, and there is a very real possibility that Latics, 18 months removed from winning the FA Cup, head into next week's international break in the second tier's relegation zone.

When asked whether he feared chairman Dave Whelan could be searching for a new manager over the next fortnight as a result, Rosler replied: 'You'll have to ask the chairman. I am fearless, but there's always a risk when I started (as a manager) 10 years ago and it is still the same.'
