The BBC programme Escape To The Country helped a paedophile find a luxury home with enough land to keep alpacas, it has emerged.

Darren Robinson, 41, featured on the BBC Two programme and was helped by presenter Jonnie Irwin to find a lavish home in South Wales so he and his wife Kasia could start afresh.

Robinson, a former university administrator from south-east London, hid his sick crimes from programme producers.

Complaints: Outraged viewers voiced their disgust after the programme featuring Darren Robinson (above) was aired on Wednesday. He had hidden his sick crimes from presenters

Audacious: Father-of-one Robinson demanded a four-bedroom house with period features with at least 15 acres of land overlooking the Welsh valleys in a bid to make a fresh start

But just weeks after the show was filmed in May, Robinson was jailed for 30 months for eight counts of abusing a child – thought to be just 15 – in his London home and one count of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

He had been charged with the crimes a year before filming began.

The episode followed Robinson and his partner’s quest to find a rural home with enough land to live off and in order to become alpaca farmers.

Robinson wanted to enjoy 'the wilds of the countryside' such as that surrounding Roch in Pembrokeshire (pictured)

One of the properties he viewed was in the same area as a primary school in Roch, Pembrokeshire.

On the show he said: ‘London seems to have got a little bit more unpleasant. So we think the time is right to enjoy the wilds of the countryside.’

Outraged viewers voiced their disgust after the programme was aired on Wednesday at 3pm.

One viewer told The Sun: ‘After the recent revelations over the BBC and child-sex offenders, they should be doing their research and vetting people more thoroughly before giving them airtime.

‘The BBC needs to take some accountability for this in light of everything Jimmy Savile-related.’

It has since been removed from the BBC iplayer online catch up service.

Popular: The show featuring Robinson caused outrage among viewers when it was aired

House-hunters applying to be on the programme are asked to provide details to the BBC before they are featured on the popular daytime show, made by Boundless Productions.

Hopeful applicants are asked to give details of their occupation, their reasons for moving and are asked whether they need to be near certain amenities such as schools or motorways.

The online application form does not ask for details of spent convictions or for any pending criminal charges.

Peter Saunders, Chief Executive of the abuse charity National Association for People Abused in Childhood, told the Sun: ‘It’s the height of insensitivity to broadcast something that features somebody who’s committed such a vile crime.

‘This could have huge psychological effects on a victim, It cries out for more vigilance and I’m hoping to meet the new BBC Director General to discuss things like this.’

A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘The BBC asks for checks on all contributors to be undertaken yet Mr Robinson deliberately withheld information, misled the production team and signed a contract stating that he had no unspent criminal convictions or pending proceedings.

‘The episode has now been removed from iPlayer and will not be repeated.

The spokesman added: ‘We categorically would not have broadcast that had we known about the investigation into Mr Robinson beforehand.

‘We would never had made the programme had we known about it previously.’

Escape To The Country is in its 14th series and is presented by Alistair Appleton, Nicki Chapman, Jonnie Irwin and Jules Hudson.
