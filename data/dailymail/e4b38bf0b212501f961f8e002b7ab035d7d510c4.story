Animals often use their brightly coloured bodies to scare off predators, so this damselfly must be hoping its hunter is scared of dogs as it disguises itself as a cartoon animal.

The green markings on its back resemble the large eyes of Pluto, the Disney character, while its actual eyes make up the dog's upper lip.

What's more, the giant wings on its back appear to be the dog's ears.

This damselfly was spotted in Russia by a photographer who noticed the uncanny resemblance with Pluto

Darius Morgendorfer, 26, took the pictures after spotting the intriguing insect near a pier

Photographer Darius Morgendorfer from Saint Petersburg, Russia, took pictures after spotting the intriguing insect near a pier.

The 26-year-old said: 'When I was taking the pictures, I wasn't thinking about the way it looked in particular.

'But when I showed my friends, they said the damselfly looks just like a cartoon dog, we all laughed when saw it.

'We were smiling as we looked through the photographs and it definitely looks like a cartoon dog. It looks like Droopy or Pluto.'

Damselflies are easily confused with dragonflies as both have a similar body shape with long, thin wings.

Damselflies can be distinguished from their close relatives by the fact that they hold their wings by their side when resting, while dragonfly wings will be extended at all times.

damselflies actually change their colours several times during their lives, often appearing as dark green or grey while they are young, and then as a rusty brown colour when they reach old age.

They are common throughout the UK and feed on small insects, flies, and have even been known to pluck spiders from their webs and eat them.
