Joel Campbell again gave a hint that there was more to come from the Costa Rica forward, despite being starved of service in the last-16 tie against Greece.

Costa Rica may have had just one shot on target all game, but the man who will line up at the Emirates Stadium next season was part of everything good they produced and was a handful for an experienced Greece backline.

The 22-year-old is an awkward player to get to grips with. The Greeks, usually so defensively sound, found him a nuisance and for long periods they couldn't get near him as he provided a useful outlet for Costa Rican counter-attacks.

Hard to beat: Campbell often leftt he Greece defenders floored as they tried to challenge him

Handful: Campbell made a nuisance of himself and the Greek defenders couldn't handle him

Ouch: Campbell took a bit of a kicking as the defenders often found his ankles rather than the ball

Elusive: Campbell gets the better of Andreas Samaris and uses his body to keep the ball upfront

Alone: The 22-year-old was isolated for long periods but still impressed up front for Costa Rica

One step ahead: Jose Holebas grabs at Campbell's arm in Greece's latest attempt to stop him

5 minutes: Leads a pacey counter-attack, slicing through the Greek defence - but his ball to Bryan Ruiz is wasteful.

20 minutes: Campbell darts towards the box, cutting in from the right, but is brought down just outside the box.

34 minutes: Tricks his way past a defender but his moves were too clever leading to him losing control and the ball.

70 minutes: Campbell perfectly shows his qualities as a counter-attacking outlet, brilliantly bringing down a long ball and leaving the Greek defender to chase him

103 minutes: The 22-year-old's impressive workrate seems to have tired him out and he showed signs of struggling to offer quite as much for his side.

111 minutes: Campbell tries to flick the ball in as a low cross comes to him but he misses and it passes through his legs.

120 minutes: With his legs tiring Campbell loses the ball on a counter-attack and Greece almost score the winner at the other end.

Penalty shoot-out: Slots his penalty into the bottom left-hand corner, sending Orestis-Spyridon Karnezis the wrong way.

That half of Greece's back four played their club football with Olympiakos last season makes his display even more impressive. These are defenders that should be used to what Campbell does after training with him for a year - but he so often eluded them it looked like they had never heard of him.

Campbell is not the answer to Arsenal's striking problems - and labelling him as such would be nothing but problematic.

The Gunners still need to sign someone to lead the line but Campbell does provide another option that Arsenal can't currently boast.

Against Greece he was a perfect outlet as Costa Rica stood strong in defence, leaving Campbell to stretch the Greek backline, find pockets of space and use his excellent first touch to relieve pressure.

He came close to winning a first half penalty after being brought down just outside the area and constantly made himself available.

In total, he drew four fouls as the Greek defenders struggled to deal with his ability to find fight spaces before using his low centre of gravity and soft touch to bring the ball under control and keep hold of it.

Sadly he couldn't top the performance with a winning goal: missing his best chance as he allowed the ball to go between his legs as he attempted to flick it goalwards in extra time - although he did confidently convert his penalty.

The fear for Arsenal fans will be whether he can perform for a big side. Costa Rica haven't been favourites in any of their four World Cup games - in the Premier League Campbell will be expected to help break down underdogs.

Roll with the punches: Campbell looked tired towards the end which may have been due to the fouling

Tough to mark: Campbell was a constantly nuisance for the Greek defenders

That can be difficult for any forward: even Romelu Lukaku, who has been so impressive at Everton and West Brom, has struggled to match those exploits in a Belgian shirt in Brazil.

But Campbell is different. His characteristics and tricky play gives Arsene Wenger's attacking bow another string and while he may not be the answer to Arsenal's big question, he could pose his own questions of Premier League defenders.
