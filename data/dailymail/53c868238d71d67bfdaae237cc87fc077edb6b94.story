Luis Suarez came off the bench to score a stunning bicycle kick in Barcelona's emphatic win against Levante on Sunday, but it is not the first time the Uruguayan has produced such brilliance.

Footage of the then 18-year-old has now circulated on the internet, from when he scored a similar goal for Nacional in a friendly against Sevilla in the summer of 2005.

The former Liverpool striker finished expertly from close range after a header from a corner was played directly into his path.

The 28-year-old outdone himself with an even better effort for current side Barcelona on Sunday though, coming off the bench to net his seventh goal for the Catalan giants since joining from Liverpool last summer.

Adriano produced some excellent work on the left flank to aim a cross towards Suarez, whose acrobatic finish put a real gloss on the scoreline for the hosts - who secured an 11th win in all competitions as a result.

After a slow start to life at the Nou Camp, Suarez has kicked on in the last couple of months, averaging a goal ratio of one in three during his time in Spain so far.
