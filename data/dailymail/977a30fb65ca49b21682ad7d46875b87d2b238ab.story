If you rate staying in London over Sheffield, or New York over Sofia, you could be in for a surprise.

Two million guests, visiting thousands of hotels across the world have voted on the best places to stay with unexpected results.

Hotel visitors were asked by worldwide hotel reservation service Hotel Info to score the hotel they had just stayed in out of ten for  value for money.

The biggest surprises was arguably New York, deemed the worst worldwide in terms of value for money

In the UK, Leeds scored the highest overall with an average rating of 7.45 out of 10. Sheffield came a close second with 7.38 and Liverpool (7.27), Bristol (7.17) and Belfast (7.15) followed just behind.

On the other hand visitors to Coventry were far less enamored with its hotels' value for money. It scored just 5.81 out of 10. Second worst was London on 6.35 - perhaps less surprising, as space in the capital is at a premium and a small room for the night can cost you thousands. Birmingham didn't fare much better on 6.52 and came third worst in the value stakes. 

Rio de Janeiro came second worst internationally in the list compiled by  Hotel Info

Internationally there were a few surprises too. Prague topped the value list with a high average rating from visitors of 7.97 out of ten for its hotels'  value. Lisbon was almost as good on 7.89 and Riga had 7.87. 

The Portuguese capital city  spoils its guests with a mild climate and many attractive sights such as old fortresses and buildings, imposing churches or the Elevador de Santa Justa, a lift connecting two parts of the city.

Prague topped the value list with a high average rating from visitors of 7.97 out of ten for its hotels' value 

At the other end of the scale New York was roundly deemed the worst value for money, winning just 5.95 points from guests. The Big Apple is undoubtedly known for its minute but blisteringly expensive rooms. Others that didn't do well were Rio de Janeiro, Copenhagen and Moscow.
