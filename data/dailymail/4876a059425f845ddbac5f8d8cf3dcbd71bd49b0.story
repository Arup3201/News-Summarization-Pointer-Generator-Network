It's day two of their royal tour of Poland and the Crown Prince and Princess of Denmark seem to be making the most of every single minute.

The pair where on a strict schedule on their second day in Warsaw on Tuesday but this time going their separate ways to attend several official events.

But the crowd favourite was plain and clear.

Guest of honour: Crown Princess Mary of Denmark visited a Lego toys workshop in Warsaw on Tuesday for the second day of the royal tour

Australian-born Mary was once again welcomed by Polish crowds who greeted her by waving their red and white Danish flags as the princess visited a children's film festival before noon.

She was once again dressed immaculately, in a floral top matched with a purple pencil skirt and beige Chanel handbag as she waved back at onlookers.

While she was there, the mother-of-four was also able to meet with children at the festival who took part in the LEGO and and New Horizons Foundation workshop.

Prior to that, the princess had paid a visit to a kindergarten for children with autism.

The final day of their royal tour will begin with a breakfast with representatives from the northwestern city and region, including the country's environmental minister and the Stettin's mayor.

The visit, from May 12 to 14, is part of a Danish business promotional campaign according to the official website for The Danish Monarchy.

It will focus on Danish-Polish trade in, among other areas, farming and foods, fashion and design, energy and environment and health.
