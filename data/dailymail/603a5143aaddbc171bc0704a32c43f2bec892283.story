The first soldier to survive after losing all four limbs in the Iraq war has undergone an experimental double-arm transplant it was announced today.

New York resident, Brendan Marrocco, 26, underwent the operation on December 18th at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, according to his father who confirmed the operation to the Associated Press.

He also received bone marrow from the same dead donor who supplied his new arms - a new approach aimed at helping his body accept the new limbs with minimal medication to prevent rejection.

The military is sponsoring operations like these to help wounded troops. About 300 have lost arms or hands in the wars.

'He was the first quad amputee to survive' from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and there have been four others since then, said Brendan Marrocco's father, Alex Marrocco. 'He was really excited to get new arms.'

The Marroccos want to thank the donor's family for 'making a selfless decision ... making a difference in Brendan's life,' the father said.

Surgeons plan to discuss the transplant at a news conference with the patient on Tuesday.

The 13-hour operation was led by Dr. 
W.P. Andrew Lee, plastic surgery chief at Johns Hopkins, and is the 
seventh double-hand or double-arm transplant completed in the United States.

Lee led three of those earlier 
operations when he previously worked at the University of Pittsburgh, 
including the only above-elbow transplant that had been done at the 
time, in 2010.

Marrocco's 'was the most complicated 
one' so far, Lee said in an interview Monday. It will take more than a 
year to know how fully Marrocco will be able to use the new arms, Lee 
said.

'The maximum speed is an inch a month
for nerve regeneration,' he explained. 'We're easily looking at a 
couple years' until the full extent of recovery is known.

While at Pittsburgh, Lee pioneered 
the novel immune suppression approach used for Marrocco.

The surgeon led
hand transplant operations on five patients, giving them marrow from 
their donors in addition to the new limbs.

All five recipients have done well 
and four have been able to take just one anti-rejection drug instead of 
combination treatments most transplant patients receive.

It was on Easter Sunday of 2009 in Iraq that Brendan Marrocco lost all four of his limbs when his vehicle ran over a roadside bomb.

'It just took both arms, my left leg off completely and my right leg was still attached a little bit,' Marrocco said to CBS News, 'and killed my gunner - my best friend.'

'I severed my carotid artery,' Marrocco said. 'That alone should have killed me.'

Indeed, the cruel irony of the gruesome incident meant that Marrocco did not bleed to death within minutes because the heat of the blast cauterized the same wounds it had caused.

'I was barely bleeding from them,' Marrocco said.

'I wasn't expected to live,' Marrocco recalled. 'I died three times and came back.' No pulse. 'Flat-out dead.'

Despite his best friend Michael Anaya dying in the blast, Marrocco felt himself lucky to survive, even with his terrible injuries.

'I will not sit down and let my injuries take over my life,' said the quadruple amputee to CBS News.

During his rehabilitation, Marrocco often commented that missing his arms was worse, 'by far'.

'Without legs you can still be independent. You know, without arms there's so much more you can't do,' Marrocco said.

During his recovery, Marrocco became an inspiration to others, meeting sportsmen such as Tiger Woods and Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees.

Minimizing anti-rejection drugs is important because they have side effects and raise the risk of cancer over the long term.

Those risks have limited the willingness of surgeons and patients to do more hand, arm and even face transplants.

Unlike a life-saving heart or liver transplant, limb transplants are aimed at improving quality of life, not extending it.

Quality of life is a key concern for 
people missing arms and hands - prosthetics for those limbs are not as 
advanced as those for feet and legs.

Lee has received funding for his work
from AFIRM, the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine, a 
cooperative research network of top hospitals and universities around 
the country that the government formed about five years ago.

With government money, he and several
other plastic surgeons around the country are preparing to do more face
transplants, possibly using the new minimal immune suppression 
approach.

Marrocco expects to spend three to 
four months at Hopkins, then return to a military hospital to continue 
physical therapy, his father said.

Before the operation, he had been 
living with his older brother in a handicapped-accessible home on New 
York's Staten Island built with the help of several charities.

The home was heavily damaged by Superstorm Sandy last fall.

Despite being in a lot of pain for some time after the operation, Marrocco showed a sense of humor, his father said.

He had a hoarse voice from a tube in 
his throat during the long surgery, decided that he sounded like Al 
Pacino, and started doing movie lines.

'He was making the nurses laugh,' Alex Marrocco said.
