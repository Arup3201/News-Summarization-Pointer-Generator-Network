Motorists in the capital could soon find themselves forced to pay for each mile they drive under radical new air quality proposals by Mayor of London Boris Johnson.

Mr Johnson's plans would see fuel duty and road tax replaced with a charge of access to roads, but with discounts available for low-emission vehicles.

The proposals are part of an attempt to reduce the number of premature deaths caused by diesel engine pollution.

Mr Johnson says the plans would need to be supported by central Government and EU action and funding. 

The proposals are part of a report released by the mayor's office yesterday and posted on the Travel for London website.

Mr Johnson says more radical measures such as this may be needed to bring forward the date of compliance for NO2 emissions and to significantly tackle vehicle emission levels. 

The proposals were released on the same day Mr Johnson called for all diesel cars which are more than a year old to be scrapped because their fumes harm people's health. 

He wants the Government to pay the owners between £1,000 and £2,000 in a national scrappage scheme.

He added millions were unfairly ‘seduced’ into buying diesel by being told it was greener.

Scientists believe diesel produces more of the tiny particles and nitrogen oxides that damage human health. 

It is now known that diesel fumes create a variety of long-term problems for the heart and lungs, particularly in children. 

 Mr Johnson has also announced moves to discourage diesel cars in the capital, with all diesel drivers being charged an extra £10 to drive into central London

Senior scientists have even blamed diesel for directly causing the deaths of 7,000 people in Britain every year.

Earlier in the year Mr Johnson, who drives a petrol Toyota people carrier, announced moves to discourage diesel cars in the capital.

In July he revealed plans for almost all diesel vehicle drivers to be charged an extra £10 to drive into Central London as part of a new ultra-low emissions zone from 2020.

Other cities across the country are also considering a charge as they urgently look at ways to cut diesel fumes to comply with EU clean air rules.

Around 29,000 deaths a year are linked to air pollution in Britain.

Britain is facing £300 million in European Commission fines for repeatedly failing to reduce levels of nitrogen dioxide air pollution

Strict targets should have been met by January 2010 and in February this year the EU launched legal proceedings to force the Government to deal with air pollution. 

In the report, Mr Johnson said: 'London’s air is no longer clogged with the industrial effluent that caused its infamous pea-soupers, and I am proud to say we have made great progress through the most ambitious and comprehensive set of measures to improve air quality this city has ever seen.

'The aim is simple – to keep improving quality of life and make London’s air the cleanest of any major world city.

'Improving London’s air quality is an urgent challenge - it affects the health and well-being of all Londoners, and it simply cannot be put on hold.'
