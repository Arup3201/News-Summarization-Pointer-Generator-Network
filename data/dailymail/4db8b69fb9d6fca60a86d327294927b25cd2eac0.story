A cast taken from the face of William Shakespeare is to go on display for the first time later this month.  

The bard's death mask will be shown at the University of Edinburgh's Anatomy Museum from January 28, when it unveils a macabre collection of medical artefacts to the public.  

Presently on loan from the William Ramsay Henderson Collection, the famous face will soon find a permanent home at the museum.

Immortalised in life and death: This painting (right) is believed to date from 1610, when Shakespeare was in his mid-forties. The death mask (left) shows his face as it would have been when he died, aged 52. 

Visitors can also cast an eye over the death masks of Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott, world-famous physicist Sir Isaac Newton, and King George III.

For those who love a ghoulish sight, the haunting facial cast of mass murderer William Burke will be on display alongside his skeleton and items made from his tanned skin.

Together with accomplice William Hare, Burke carried out at least 15 murders in the 1820s and sold the bodies for use in anatomy lessons at Edinburgh University.

When the pair were caught, Hare was offered immunity from prosecution if he confessed and agreed to testify against his former partner.

Burke was sentenced to death by hanging in 1829, and then publicly dissected at the Edinburgh Medical College.

The dissecting professor, Alexander Monro, dipped his quill pen into Burke's blood and wrote, 'This is written with the blood of Wm Burke, who was hanged at Edinburgh. This blood was taken from his head.'

Face of a genius: Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) scientist and astronomer, was the father of modern physics

Eminent Scot: Edinburgh-born writer Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832) wrote historical novels, plays and poems

Edinburgh University's Museum of Anatomy has recently undergone a major revamp, and will re-open on the 183rd anniversary of Burke’s execution.

In total more than 40 masks, created from casts taken in both life and death, will be on display.

Such masks were popular in the 19th century, when they were used in  the now-discredited practice of phrenology. 

This postulated that the shape and size of a person’s skull could help explain their mind and behaviour.

They fell out of favour as photography became more common, but were sometimes used to preserve the facial features of public figures or unidentified bodies.

Exhibit A: Dr Gordon Findlater holds the death mask of mass murderer William Burke, soon to go on public display

Ghoulish: Dr Findlater with William Burke's skeleton, which was previously kept under lock and key

Death mask: This plaster cast of Burke's head will be on display along with preserved corpses and pickled brains

Preserved in plaster: The cast came to light unexpectedly in 2009 after being found in a store cupboard at Inveraray jail in Argyll

Other artefacts at the museum include 19th century anatomical teaching models made from wax and wood, as well as a preserved body from the late 1790s, which is exhibited alongside an etching carried out when the remains were embalmed.

Visitors to the museum at the Teviot Medical School, which opened in 1884, will also be able to see the historic anatomy lecture theatre.

Gordon Findlater of the university’s anatomy department said: ‘The museum provides a fascinating insight into how anatomy has progressed from the late 1700s to the present day.’

The Anatomy Museum, in Teviot Place, Edinburgh, will be open to the public on the last Saturday of every month, from 10am-4pm, starting on January 28.
