'Cape Verde? Heard of it, but remind me... '

That was always my response to any mention of the place.

So here's the answer: Cabo Verde, as it's properly known, is a necklace of ten islands in the Atlantic, 350 miles west of Africa, off the coast of Senegal.

It's a near six-hour flight from the UK. The sunshine is utterly reliable, as is the breeze from the Sahara.

Surf's up: The Cape Verdean island of Sal is (relatively) well known as a haven for unhurried sunshine holidays

The windiest time is November to March, which is bliss for surfers. The islands of Sal and Boa Vista are the big destinations for beach-and-a-book breaks.

Of the hotels on Sal, the most comfy and glamorous is the Morabeza in the fishing village of Santa Maria. There's a 200-yard walk to miles of glorious beach where boats bob on the turquoise water.

Life here slows down to turtle pace. In the evenings you can watch the fishwives gutting their catch on the pier.

Santa Maria is a haven for yachting and water sports. The current world champion kite surfer lives here.

But once you've bathed in Sal's inland version of the Dead Sea and visited its superb coast, you may want a bit more.

Bright and lovely: The streets of Mindelo, the capital of Sao Vicente, are flanked by colourfully painted houses

Sounds to soothe: Music is a big part of Cape Verde life. The islands have their own musical style, morna

There's plenty of variety in this tiny 39-year-old republic, a former colony of Portugal, whose intrepid sailors discovered the islands in the 1450s.

It's a 30-minute flight from Sal to the island of Sao Vicente, where we stayed in Mindelo, a colourful harbour town that, thanks to its Portuguese and British heritage, looks like Lisbon crossed with Portmeirion in Wales.

Locals all speak Creole, a mish-mash of umpteen languages, African and European.

'It was designed to fool the Portuguese,' as one local graduate explained to me.

Mindelo has fewer tourists, most of them are French.

They come for the music scene and to worship the late singer Cesaria Evora, 'the barefoot diva'. Her voice remains the islands' proudest export and she is revered by Parisians.

On the edge of town is a peak, Monte Verde, well worth the three-hour walk up its switchback road past cactus flowers, wrinkly old men with donkeys and the occasional goat.

A place of wild wonder: Santo Antao, the most westerly island of Cape Verde, is a great destination for hikers

The view from the top is worth every blister.

An hour by ferry from Sao Vicente is the mountainous island of Santo Antao. Hike the ribeiras (river valleys). After the moon-like aridity of Sal, they are an emerald paradise.

I took a local guide — supplied by Cape Verde Experience — in a four-wheel drive to the top of a 1,000m-high volcanic peak, then walked down a hairpin trail of wonky basalt cobbles past the cauldron of the vast volcano.

When the rains come, water bombs down the rocky gullies, washing away cattle and everything else in its path.

As you slowly descend, cooking smoke and the sounds of a village rise to greet you. Hens cluck and you walk past tiny children in crocodiles wandering home from school for lunch. Dragonflies flit over streams flanked by mango trees, papayas, and huge hands of green bananas.

Later, in a straw-roofed cafe, I ate a banana served with local molasses - quite the best pud I've ever had.

The old seaside village of Paul has a tiny distillery with a donkey-driven mill for crushing sugar cane - a sight that hasn't changed in centuries.

Walk me to the beach: Colourful boats are a constant presence in an archipelago where fishing is crucial

But it's the people of Cape Verde that make it irresistible. Catholic, strict but loving with their kids, proud of their mixed heritage and all addicted to Premier League football.

Centenarians are common.

Enzo, a born-and-bred barman in Mindelo, tells me that his grandfather had died at 102. I clearly didn't look impressed enough. 'He was very unfit,' he adds apologetically.

The Cape Verde Experience (0845 330 2047, www.capeverde.co.uk) offers seven-night island-hopping holidays from £1,433 per person or 14 nights from £1,755 per person, both including flights.

A week's stay at the four-star Hotel Morabeza on the island of Sal costs from £873 pp, based on two sharing a double land view room with bed and breakfast, including return flights and transfers.
