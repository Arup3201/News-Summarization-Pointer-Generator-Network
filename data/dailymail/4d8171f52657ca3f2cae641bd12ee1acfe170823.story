Fate in the balance: Bardwil waits before his hearing at Manhattan's Supreme Court

A millionaire businessman who threatened a burglar inside his home with a gun is facing three years in jail because he did not have a license for the weapon.

George Bardwil, who owns linen company Bardwil Home, was at home in his E. 51st Street apartment in Manhattan in January, when a man broke in.

Bardwil, 60, brandished the gun at the intruder, who then fled, and the businessman called 911.

But when he showed police footage of 
the incident recorded on his home security system he was arrested on 
suspicion of possessing an illegal gun.

Bardwil
 - known as the 'Linen King' - denies the charges and pleaded not guilty
 to gun possession at the Supreme Court in Manhattan yesterday.

His
 defense lawyer Michael Bachner told the New York Post that the loaded 
.40 cal Sig Sauer was kept in a secure box in Bardwil's apartment and 
was legally registered to his bodyguard.

Prosecutors will recommend a three year sentence at court.

Mr Bachner told the New York Post: 'There's no dispute that George was being burglarized.

'George had been the victim of multiple burglaries, and the DA's office concedes that it was used in self defense.'  

A man has also been arrested in connection with the burglary.

Bardwil Industries was founded in 1906 and is based in New York and sells a range of linen and bath towels and rugs.

Bardwil is also facing assault charges after he allegedly attacked his ex-wife Emiko.

He is on $250,000 bail, according to the New York Post.

She suffered a cut to her head after hitting the sidewalk but Bardwil said she fell.
