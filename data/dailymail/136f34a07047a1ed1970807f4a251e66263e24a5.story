Gary McKinnon hacked into Nasa and Pentagon computers while looking for evidence of 'little green men'

An adviser to the US government on cyber warfare last night attacked America’s ‘ridiculous’ and ‘punitive’ attempt to extradite British hacker Gary McKinnon.

John Arquilla said officials should instead be hiring the Asperger’s sufferer to help them improve the security of their computers.

Mr McKinnon, 46, has been fighting extradition for the past decade after hacking into Nasa and Pentagon databases while looking for evidence of ‘little green men’.

Medical experts say he may take his own life if bundled on a plane against his will.

Mr Arquilla, a professor of defence analysis at the US Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, said Mr McKinnon’s extradition would not deter other hackers.

He added: ‘Personally I think it’s ridiculous. And punitive.

‘They’re attempting to create a deterrent effect that will not deter and is slowing our progress.’

Mr Arquilla said people with Mr McKinnon’s ability with computers should be considered for a job providing security advice.

He added: ‘There are other places in the world where these communities are embraced by official authority, and these are places that are becoming great cyber powers.

‘The analogy is as if after World War
Two the Russians were using these rocket scientists while we put the 
ones we got on trial and incarcerated them.’

Mr Arquilla said there were some people in the US government who shared his view that hackers should be hired, not prosecuted.

He continued: ‘There are good people 
in many different departments of the US government that are open to this
idea, but they are a tiny minority.’

Mr McKinnon, from London, is awaiting a
decision from Home Secretary Theresa May on whether he can be sent 
across the Atlantic despite the fears he may kill himself if extradited.

Nick Clegg, pictured with Janis Sharp outside the Home Office in 2009, has also pledged his support to Mr McKinnon in the past

Mrs May is examining medical evidence about his psychiatric state.

There was outrage last month when a 
notorious Irish-American paedophile living in South London won his 
battle against extradition to the US.

Shawn Sullivan, who was on Interpol’s most wanted list, won the right to stay in Britain on human rights grounds.

The High Court in London said the 
43-year old was at risk of being put on a sex offenders’ programme in 
Minnesota that would breach his human rights.

Mr McKinnon’s case has also exposed 
the operation of the US/UK extradition treaty which critics say is 
lopsided and unfair on  Britons.
