The smell of braai tinged the streets surrounding Kings Park last night and South Africa tasted blood as they demolished Wales 38-16 in the opening Test in Durban on Saturday.

Wales were served up on a plate and their dismal record against Southern Hemisphere sides continued with a woeful performance on the Eastern Cape

Since Warren Gatland took over as head coach in 2007, Wales have beaten the big three – Australia, New Zealand and South Africa – just once. The misery continued in Durban and South Africa remains a country where Welsh rugby goes to rack and ruin.

There were at least three minutes of Welsh optimism, but that was all. Dan Biggar put Wales ahead with an early drop-goal and it all went downhill from there.

South Africa quickly worked out the Welsh frailties and they began to remind the tourists why they have never won a Test match in the Rainbow Nation. The rush defence was unlocked and Willie le Roux, the gifted Springbok, offered a master-class from full-back.

Seven minutes into the game he chipped over the pressing defensive line and Bryan Habana showed his poaching instincts to get in behind Cuthbert and touch down for the opening try of the game.

South Africa’s midfield had been identified as an area of weakness before the match. The experience gap between the two centre partnerships was stark. Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Davies, of Wales, had 98 Test starts at 12 and 13 while Jan Serfontein and JP Pietersen, their opponents, had zero.

But Roberts was shown a yellow card when he took out Le Roux in mid-air and the hosts took full advantage in the 10 minutes that followed. Three minutes into Roberts’ cool down period and the Kings Park crowd were back on their feet.

The Springbok pack were inspired by the return of Victor Matfield, 37, who came out of retirement to become the oldest ever South African captain. The warhorse was reunited in the second row with partner-in-crime Bakkies Botha for the first time since 2011 and they rolled back the years as the Springbok pack rumbled forwards from a line-out to set up No 8 Duane Vermeulen to crash over.

Another drop goal from Biggar offered some light relief but, with still just 21 minutes on the clock, the Springboks scored their third try when Le Roux goose-stepped between Cuthbert and Aaron Shingler to feed Habana for his second..

Damage was done but, with Roberts back on the field, Gatland would have hoped to see more cohesion across the park. But Wales were woeful. They failed to capitalise on their rare opportunities and Le Roux once again exposed the cracks when he gathered his own kick and wriggled through the tackle of George North to score.

Biggar added a penalty just before the break but - with Wales trailing 28-9 at half time  - the sun set on the Eastern Cape and the match turned even darker for Gatland’s side.

Morne Steyn added to his first-half points with an early second-half penalty and Le Roux got on the outside shoulder of Ken Owens to set up Hendricks for another Springbok try. There was a late breakaway try from Cuthbert but it was too late, Wales had already been cooked.
