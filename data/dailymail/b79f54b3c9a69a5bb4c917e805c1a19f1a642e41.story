Police search teams have failed to find the body of the 19-year old. Inspector Matt Kehoe has urged everyone to ensure utmost caution when swimming in waterholes this Summer.

'Any waterhole that's around this area with rope swings and rocks that have warnings they are dangerous,' he said.

'We'd just stress to people to be careful at this time of year particularly given we've had some large rainfall, the water is flowing very quickly down there, it's very murky.'

Police say a post mortem for the young man found in the camp-site will determine the cause of death.

The incident is not being treated as suspicious.

A statement being released by Falls said: 'A report is being prepared for the coroner and the festival cannot comment further as it is a police matter.'

'Our thoughts are with his family and friends during this terribly sad time.'

The festival kicked off on December 30, and will continue until January 3.
