A library boss in New York City faces losing his job after he allegedly went on a rampant $40,000 spending spree, blowing cash on lavish dinners, concert tickets and trips abroad.

Thomas Galante, director of Queens Library, could be axed next Wednesday after a newly-installed board of trustees found he was using his corporate credit card to expense trips on alleged library business to Barcelona, Amsterdam, Athens, Helsinki, Aspen and Newport Beach in California. 

He also charged $23,000 to a furniture store which went to kit out his executive office and a rooftop smoking deck at the library, the Daily News reported. 

Queens Library chief Thomas Galante could lose his job next week after running up bills of $40,000 on a corporate credit card 

The blowouts, which are documented in records back to 2011, also included restaurant tabs to the tune of thousands of dollars and bills run up at casinos and liquor stores.

According to the NYDN, Galante spent $2,740 at Morton’s Wacker Place Steakhouse in Chicago on June 30 this year; $5,620 at Vetro Restaurant and Lounge in Howard Beach, Queens; and $3,480 at Dazies in Sunnyside, Queens.

In December 2011, $1,100 was spent on tickets to see Coldplay. 

Galante also reportedly hit the credit card for daily runs to Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks along with washing his car and auto repairs.

Hundreds of dollars of cookies were ordered from a gourmet company on the card. 

John Hyslop, president of library workers Local 1321, told MailOnline on Thursday: 'The hubris and excess of Thomas Galante is disgraceful and is so detrimental to the Queens Library, its customers and staff - especially because we've been pleading for more funds to hire more people and serve the public.' 

Although it is assumed that many of the large purchases were made due to library business, the volume of charges, in particular for lavish dinners, attracted attention. 

Galante was placed on leave in September as the review took place but was still being paid $392,000. 

Sources told the NYDN that it is expected that Galante's dismissal will come recommended. The library is 85 per cent public-funded.

Mr Hyslop claimed that while Galante was in charge, he contracted out the positions for custodians, claiming that the library could not afford them with its budget.

He also said that a public staff member had not been hired since 2008, meaning library opening hours were cut back. 

Mr Hyslop added that library workers - some of whom have salaries around $29,000 - were forced to pay out of pocket to attend conferences because their budget would not cover entire trips. 

However he added that the library trustees and interim director had moved on from the reported scandal. 

'We are committed to transparency and integrity at the Queens Library,' Mr Hyslop said. 

'We want the best for our customers.' 

MailOnline was awaiting a comment on Thursday from the officer of Queens Borough President, Melinda Katz. 

A comment from Mr Galante's lawyer, Thomas Martini, was also sought.
