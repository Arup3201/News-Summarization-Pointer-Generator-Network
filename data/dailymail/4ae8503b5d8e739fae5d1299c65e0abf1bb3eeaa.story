Twelve American Secret Service agents assigned to protect President Obama at an international summit in Colombia have been sent home after being accused of taking prostitutes back to their hotel.

The incident is alleged to have taken place at the £300-a-night Hotel Caribe in Cartagena on the coast of the South American country last week.

The Secret Service was alerted after one of the prostitutes complained to police that she had not been paid by one of the agents.

Mr Obama flew into Cartagena on Friday to join more than 30 other world leaders at a conference on trade and economic policy.

The agents had arrived in Colombia earlier in the week to check security.

An employee at the Hotel Caribe claimed that the men had been drinking heavily before the alleged incident.

The Secret Service did not reveal whether the disgraced agents have been suspended.

The episode came to light after 
Secret Service insiders leaked details of the scandal to Washington 
investigative reporter Ron Kessler.

Mr Kessler said: 'Prostitution is 
legal in Colombia and so the woman filed a complaint with the police. 
They complained to the U.S. State Department who complained to the 
Secret Service,  who informed the White House and the 12 were removed 
and replaced.

'The Secret Service had hoped to keep
it quiet, but I was contacted by sources who are concerned that this is
part of a pattern of rules not being adhered to  or enforced.'

Several of the agents are married, 
according to Mr Kessler, a former reporter for The Washington Post and 
author of the book In The President's Secret Service: Behind The Scenes 
With Agents In The Line Of Fire.

'Any breach like this can open the 
door to an assassination attempt on the President,' he said. 'The fact 
that some of the agents are married could make them subject to blackmail
by terrorists who need access to a secure area.'

Concerns surrounding the President's 
security during the visit to Colombia mounted when two bombs exploded in
Cartagena and two more in the capital Bogota on the day he arrived. No 
casualties or injuries were reported.

A spokesman for the Secret Service, 
Edwin Donovan, refused to  disclose details of the charges against the 
agents, but the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association said that 
at least one member  of the President's security detail had been accused
of involvement in the scandal.

Mr Donovan said the allegations would be investigated by the agency's internal affairs unit.

Jon Adler, president of the Federal 
Law Enforcement Officers Association, described the charges as 'very 
serious', adding that the agency 'needs to properly investigate and 
fairly ascertain the merits of the allegations'.

Recruitment standards for the agency are 'tough on paper', a  Washington insider told The Mail  on Sunday.

'Agents must be between 21 and 37 
years old, but a few particularly good veterans are allowed to stay on 
the detail into their mid-40s,' he said. 'The Secret Service prefers 
members of the presidential detail to be married because that is 
believed to make them “quieter” and more understanding of the 
President's domestic needs.'

At least 20 agents surround the 
President whenever he leaves the White House and the expert said that 
twice that number are believed to have been dispatched to Colombia for 
advance arrangements.

As expert marksmen, their suits are 
tailored to hide SIG Sauer P229 handguns and they also are equipped with
Remington 870 shotguns as well as Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine 
guns.    

Their starting pay is about £60,000 a year, but with overtime and  special allowances they can make twice that amount.

'Their training includes a lecture on
the John F Kennedy assassination and the dangers of drinking before any
job,' said the insider.

A senior Latin American diplomat said
he was informed by his nation's delegation at the Colombian summit that
several  agents 'went as a group looking for sex'.

He said that after one of the women had complained, 'the police confronted the secret agents and got nowhere'.

He added: 'The matter was then 
referred to Colombian foreign ministry officials who in turn spoke with 
their US Department of State counterparts. They then confronted the 
Secret Service and demanded the group of agents involved leave before 
President Obama arrived'.
