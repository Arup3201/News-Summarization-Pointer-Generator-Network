A high school student who was sent home from school because her dyed red hair was said to have violated school rules has won the right to return to class without changing the color, it emerged today.

Last Monday, Mabry Anderson was told by officials at Tavares High School, Orlando, that she had a week to change her flaming red hair color because it broke the Student Code of Conduct.

The school district changed the policy two years ago to say students had to have their natural hair color.

Speaking to WKMG, Mabry said:  'I didn't want it to be such a big issue. I just wanted to go to school. I felt harassed. It got to the point where I have anxiety going to school.

'It's never been a problem before. It's my First Amendment right for freedom of expression and it's being taken away.'

She gets her color from a box made by L'oreal and argues that for some people it can be a natural hair color. 

Her mother Cate Rettig said she knows the color might attract attention bur thinks her daughter has been treated unfairly, especially since she left school crying.

'She's a new principal. I feel she's flexing her authoritative muscle,' said Rettig.

Mabry just found out today that she will be able to return to the school on Tuesday as the principal decided her red hair was no longer a distraction. 

Mabry is now working on getting the school policy changed and has set up a Facebook page to rally support.
