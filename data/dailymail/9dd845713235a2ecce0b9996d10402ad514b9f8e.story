Rapist: Footballer Ched Evans is due to be released within days. His victim has had to go into hiding due to online taunts

The woman who was raped by footballer Ched Evans is in hiding two years on – thanks to an internet campaign branding her a ‘money-grabbing’ liar.

The victim was forced to adopt a new identity and leave her home town after Evans’ supporters broke the law by posting her name on Twitter in 2012.

And now, just days before the Sheffield United striker is due to be released from jail, the woman has had to endure a further spate of online slurs.

The campaign of abuse has been given fresh impetus by controversial comments from broadcaster Judy Finnigan, who claimed during ITV’s Loose Women show on Monday that the rape was ‘unpleasant’ but ‘not violent’ and the victim had ‘had far too much to drink’. She later apologised after a furious backlash.

But yesterday Evans’ mother took to Twitter to praise Miss Finnigan’s intervention and highlight barbed comments still being posted by other users.

Following the footballer’s rape conviction and five-year jail sentence in 2012, thousands of people – among them Evans’ friends and relatives – branded the victim a liar and named her on social media, despite her legal entitlement to lifelong anonymity as the victim of a sex attack.

A web search today will still bring up sites claiming to name her and making vile comments about her part in the case.

Police said that while some of the so-called ‘trolls’ were male football fans, the majority were women, many of whom made deeply personal attacks on the victim’s motivation in reporting the rape.

Evans and his former Manchester City youth side team-mate Clayton McDonald had been out in his home town of Rhyl, Denbighshire in May 2011 and had booked a room at a nearby Premier Inn, their trial heard.

He later told police they could have had ‘any girl we wanted’, saying: ‘We are footballers, that’s how it is. Footballers are rich, they have got money, that’s what the girls like.’

 The victim – who they had earlier seen falling over in a kebab shop after drinking wine, double vodkas with lemonade and a sambuca shot – had approached McDonald, and the pair took a taxi to his hotel.

When Evans entered the room, he found the pair having sex, and claimed McDonald asked if he wanted to have sex with the girl too, saying she had been ‘in control’ of herself.

Evans left the hotel via a fire escape shortly after having sex with her, later telling police he had been worried his girlfriend Natasha Massey would phone him and become suspicious.

The girl awoke the next morning, naked and alone, and told police the last thing she could remember was being in a takeaway.

McDonald was acquitted of rape by the jury at Caernarfon Crown Court, but Evans looked shocked as he was found guilty. He was told by the judge he ‘must have realised’ that she had been ‘in no condition to have sexual intercourse’.

Appeal court judges refused a bid to overturn the conviction, saying there was ‘no possible basis which would justify us interfering with the verdict of the jury’, also throwing out an attempt to cut his sentence.

Evans, 25, is desperate to resume his football career when he is released on Friday from Wymott prison in Lancashire, half way through his sentence.

But a petition appealing to Sheffield United chairman Kevin McCabe not to reinstate him had attracted almost 150,000 signatures after Miss Finnigan’s comments.

Making her debut on Monday’s Loose Women, Miss Finnigan argued Evans should be allowed to play football again, saying: ‘I am not by any means minimising any kind of rape, but the rape was not violent.

‘He didn’t cause any bodily harm to the person. It was unpleasant. In a hotel room I believe. And she had had far too much to drink. It was reprehensible. But he has served his time.’ She later apologised ‘unreservedly’.

Yesterday Northumbria police and crime commissioner Vera Baird, who campaigns over violence against women, said: ‘He raped her – that is a serious injury. If you get drunk and someone steals your wallet, does this mean it’s any less of a theft than if you were sober?’

In 2012, around 6,000 people mentioned the victim on Twitter alone. But just 21 were arrested, and after ten pleaded guilty to breaching the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act in 2012, they were ordered to pay her compensation totalling just £6,000. The punishment was branded ‘an insult to rape victims’ at the time.
