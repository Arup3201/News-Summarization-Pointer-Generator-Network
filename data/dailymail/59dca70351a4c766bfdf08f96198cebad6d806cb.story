Hundreds of mourners have filled Sydney's St Mary's Cathedral to attend an official memorial mass for siege victims on their lunch break, where they were told 'hell has touched us'.

Sydney Archbishop Anthony Fisher OP addressed people in the packed cathedral including Australian Governor General Peter Cosgrove,   Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his wife Lucy and NSW Premier Mike Baird.

On Tuesday afternoon Archbishop Fisher spoke to the congregation about the horrific 16-hour siege that happened in the Lindt cafe, just two blocks away from St Mary's Cathedral in the CBD.

'Hostages were pinned for hours against the windows, forced to hold up a flag which blasphemously used the name of God as a threat,' Archbishop Fisher said.

'The distress was visible on their faces, as was relief the first time they escaped.'

Some congregation members had to brace themselves on the cathedral pews as they wept uncontrollably.

Dignitaries including NSW Deputy Premier Tony Grant, NSW Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklian, NSW Planning Minister Pru Goward and NSW Attorney General Brad Hazzard were also among those in attendance.

Archbishop Fisher said Sydney was not used to hearing words like 'siege', 'hostages' and 'security forces' associated with the city.

'Yet for the past day and night we have been subjected to pictures and sounds we tend to associate with faraway lands, he said.

'Hell has touched us.'

Archbishop Fisher also praised the bravery of victims Katrina Dawson, 38, and Tori Johnson, 34, who died trying to protect others from gunman Man Haron Monis's shots.

'Tragically [the gun] went off, killing [Johnson],' he said.

'But he triggered the response of the police and eventual freedom for most of the hostages.

'Reports have also emerged that Katrina Dawson was shielding her pregnant friend from gunfire.

'These heroes were willing to lay down their lives so others might live.'

But Archbishop Fisher warned Australians against becoming ‘cautious’ or ‘suspicious’ of our neighbours.

‘In the process we would undermine what we love most about our country and its way of life,’ he said.

Mr Turnbull broke down in tears outside the cathedral, while talking about the 'shocking incident'

Hundreds of people have left flowers at Martin Place as a sign of respect on Tuesday

Outside the cathedral, Mr Turnbull broke down in tears as he paid tribute to the victims of what he described as a 'shocking incident'.

'I was on a train this morning and you could feel the numbness in the carriage,' Mr Turnbull said following the mass.

'Everyone was thinking the same thoughts of shock and horror, imagining how those people suffered during that terrible night.

'Thinking about the courage of the two young people that were killed.'

Mr Turnbull added that he thought the service reminded Australians to be 'full of love'.

'It's love for each other, it's love for our country, it's that what binds us together and makes us the most successful, harmonious multicultural society in the world,' he said.

'I thought today's service was so beautiful because it was all about love, that love of God... that should inspire us all not to be corrupted by hatred and violence and to remain united as Australians now and forever.'
