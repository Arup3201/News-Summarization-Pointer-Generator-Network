One of two brothers who was sent to prison as a teenager over the murder of his parents in New Hampshire in 1996 has been given parole.

Jeffrey Dingman was 14 when he helped his brother Robert, then aged 17, to shoot their parents and hide the bodies in the family home.

The 32-year-old was released last month after spending more than half his life in prison, and will remain on parole for life.

Dingman is currently living with his mother's sister, Elizabeth Landry, who is said to have supported his early release.

She has said she plans to help Dingham, who has spent all his adult life in prison, to integrate into society again by taking him movies and social events.

'The parole board laid out some 
conditions … and he met those conditions and he was released from 
prison,' Andrea Goldberg, of the state Parole 
Board, told Foster's Daily Democrat.

While his parole case was being heard, Dingman was moved to a halfway house in Manchester, and had found a job at a mill.

However, he was forced to quit after local newspapers reported on his parole hearing.

Jeffrey Lyons, spokesman for the Department of Corrections in New Hampshire, said it was common for inmates to be found work.

They are allowed to keep some of the wages and the rest is put in a savings account for them, for when they are released.

'The parole officer offers job referrals 
and treatment referral services but the state does not pay for that. 
However, we can assist the parolee in obtaining fee waivers when 
possible,' he added.

Dingman had been sentenced to 30 years in prison, with 12 years suspended, as part of a plea deal at his 1997 trial.

His brother, Robert, was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to murder, and was sentenced to live in prison with no parole.

The brothers had shot their parents, Vance and Eve, as they returned home from work on February 6, 1996.

The bodies were then wrapped in bags and hidden in the home while the teenagers spent the weekend partying.

Police discovered the victims three days later, when a colleague of Mrs DIngham reported that she had failed to turn up for work.

At his parole hearing in December last year, Dingham said: ‘I've stayed out of trouble. I've tried to get myself prepared to move forward.'

Members of the parole board had said at the hearing they were pleased with how well Dingham had done well in prison and at the halfway house, but they worried that he lacks the life skills to succeed in society because he went to prison so young.

They said they were concerned that he had little experience with everyday activities such as managing money, using a cellphone or going to the movies.

‘I don't want to just throw you out there cold,’ board member Mark Furlone told him. ‘For 16 years, you've been insulated from the real world.’

But when asked in December whether he had any support in the community, he answered ‘not really.’

Dingman's aunt, however, told the board that wasn't true.

Speaking through tears, Mrs Landry of Greenfield, New Hampshire, said she misses her sister and brother-in-law every day, but wants to help her nephew.

‘My husband and I are willing to help Jeffrey at a second chance at life,’ she said. ‘We truly mean it from the bottom of our hearts. We forgive him.’

Dingham's lawyer, Mark Stevens said his client was still wracked with guilt over his parents' murders., adding: 'He thinks about it every day and has every day since it happened.’

During his brother's trial, Dingman admitted wounding his parents but said his brother instigated the killings and finished off both parents, taunting each before firing the fatal shots.

He said Robert asked their father, already shot once, ‘How about another one?’ and told his mother: ‘Die, bitch!’ before shooting her in the head.

Prosecutors said the older brother had chafed under his parents' rules and curfews, and Dingham  described being yelled at repeatedly by his mother and hit by his father over bad grades.

But family members denied the boys were abused and described the parents, both 40, as devoted to their sons.

Vance Dingman's sister, Darlyn, told the Associated Press in December that she opposed Jeffrey's release.

‘Personally, we wish he had fried, but that didn't happen,’ she said. ‘He should not be let out. He's as guilty as his brother.’
