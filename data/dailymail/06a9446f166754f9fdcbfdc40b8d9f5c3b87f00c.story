So, Joao Moutinho picked Arsenal apart in the Champions League, that name rings a bell…

Chelsea manager? Hates referees, Sky Sports, Ashley Barnes, Jamie Redknapp, etc?

Moutinho… Moutinho… T-T-T… tinho…

Only kidding, yes the Portuguese midfielder with loads of international caps and those oh-so-underrated Iberian midfield qualities of keeping the ball, passing it to a team-mate, getting it back, controlling the game, sliding through passes to the strikers. Doesn't score much, but you know…

That's him, good player, eh, why don't one of the English teams sign him?

Well, they've tried. For the last seven years they've been trying, since David Moyes tried to sign him for Everton and made an £11.8million offer when Moutinho was still a little-known Portugal U21 international who was catching the eye at Sporting Lisbon.

Always had a good eye, did Moyes, why didn't he get him?

The buy-out clause was nearly £20m. Everton signed a 20-year-old Belgian called Marouane Fellaini instead.

How did Moutinho wind up at Monaco?

He stayed in Lisbon for two more years and then moved to Porto under cloud with Sporting chairman Jose Eduardo Bettencourt branding him a 'rotten apple'. It was a complicated deal which included his economic rights being split between the two clubs and a third-party investor. 

This tangle probably didn't help when Tottenham tried to sign him in before the transfer deadline in August 2012. Even with an hour's extension granted by the Premier League, they were eight minutes late with the paper work and he went back to Porto.

That must have been another of those strokes of genius by the transfer master Daniel Levy…

Could be. Andre Villas-Boas was furious by all accounts. Having just replaced Spurs boss Harry Redknapp, he named Moutinho as a priority target, a fee of £24m was eventually agreed and then the deal collapsed in stoppage time. AVB must've been hopping mad, literally. 

A year later, the midfielder moved to Monaco as the cheaper end of a £51m package for both him and James Rodriguez. At the time, Monaco's new Russian owners were trying to sign anyone who moved, including Cristiano Ronaldo.

I thought Monaco had sold all their big names…

Yes, the strategy quickly changed. James was sold to Real Madrid, a year later, after an impressive World Cup and Radamel Falcao was loaned to Manchester United where he festers on the bench. 

There were rumours of a bust-up between Moutinho and the club and he was said to have thrown in a transfer request back in August when the exodus was in full swing. But he stayed and says he is focused on the season at Monaco and is in good touch, as Arsenal discovered. 

He returned from an ankle injury in time to sparkle at the Emirates and remind everyone he is perhaps the last of the club's prized assets, but the French club are producing a new generation promising young players.

Will we see him in England?

There is still interest from all the big clubs, including Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United. They are aware of his situation and Monaco's change of strategy under the strict FFP rules. 

But they will be aware of his complicated ownership background. With his previous failed attempts to move to the Premier League he might accept his destiny is elsewhere. 

Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United are still interested in the Portuguese international
