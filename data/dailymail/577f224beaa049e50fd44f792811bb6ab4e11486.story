A rape victim broke down in tears at a news conference yesterday as she recalled the moment a police officer told her 'women need to stop spreading their legs like peanut butter' when she complained that her attacker was allowed back on campus just two weeks after the assault. 

Kylie Angell, a nurse who graduated from the University of Connecticut  in May, said the school initially expelled her attacker, but 
readmitted him two weeks later without informing her of that decision.

She found out when he approached her in the cafeteria and stroked her arm.

Angell and six other women who were victims of sexual assault while they were students there filed a federal discrimination complaint on Monday against the school, claiming it did not take measures to protect them or even properly investigate the incidents.

High-profile attorney Gloria Allred announced on Monday she is representing the students and filed the complaint to the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights on their behalf.

'They
 are simply tired of seeing women being raped and sexually assaulted at 
the university while the administration chose deliberate indifference,' 
Allred said in a news conference in Hartford on Monday.

Angell was one of four complainants who appeared with Allred at the news conference to go public with their stories.

She described going to campus police after her assailant accosted her in the dining hall.

'The officer told me, "Women need to stop spreading their legs like peanut butter or rape is going to keep happening until the cows come home",' Angell said. 'Shocked, I left feeling confused, violated, traumatized and vulnerable.'

Four current students and three recent graduates are asking for an investigation under the federal Title IX law, which protects students from sexual discrimination in any education program that receives federal aid.

UConn issued a statement saying that while the women's cases remain confidential, the school felt each was handled appropriately.

'The University of Connecticut takes allegations of this nature extremely seriously, as the health and well-being of our students is a top priority.

'Our response protocol for these and other alleged incidents of sexual assault is in line with or exceeds best practices. 

'We always must be mindful of the rights of the accused and the accuser while upholding our commitment to protecting the safety of our campus community,' the statement read.

It said it would welcome any new information. It also said that in the interest of transparency, if would detail how each case was handled if the women agree to waive their rights to privacy.

'Our students should reasonably expect protection and due process,' the school said. 'They deserve the best response in the nation, and we're committed to ensuring that right.'

No criminal charges have been brought in any of the cases.

Senior Erica Daniels said she was drugged and raped by a co-worker on campus. She said she did not report her rape immediately, and was told by the school's Office of Community Standards that not enough information existed to take any action.

'I don't understand why my statement about what happened is not enough for a hearing,' she said. 'How many women are raped and witnesses are present?'

Junior Rose Richi said she initially didn't feel comfortable reporting her sexual assault because her attacker was a male athlete and there is an 'overwhelming privilege of athletes on this campus'.

She said when she did report the crime, the investigating officer told her he did not believe her.

Allred said the school is required to investigate, potentially hold hearings, listen to witnesses and notify both sides of their findings. She would not say if she plans to file lawsuits on the women's behalf, but said she is working with a Connecticut lawyer on their cases.

The civil rights complaint, if upheld, could lead to sanctions including the loss of federal funds.

Carolyn Luby, the lead complainant, said they want much more than that.

'Federal sanctions would be the tip of the iceberg of what we would want,' she said. 'We would want cultural change, policy change, administrative change.'

Luby said the school still has not responded to the death and rape threats she received after writing an open letter to President Susan Herbst in April about the culture on campus.

The letter, which in part criticized the school's new logo as menacing, was held up to ridicule on the Internet and on conservative talk radio.

She received rape and death threats, the Huffington Post reports. People walked by her on campus and called her 'a bitch', she said.

One email she received told her, 'I hope you get raped by a husky', and another said, 'I wish you would've run in the Boston marathon'.

Fraternity members sexually harassed her, Luby said, making statements like: 'Don't worry, we won't rape you,' as they drove by.

Luby said police told her to deal with the threats by wearing a hat on campus so she would not be recognized.

Speaking to reporters on campus Monday, UConn President Susan Herbst said she had not seen the complaint, but pointed out that both she and the school's police chief are women.

'I feel like this campus is very safe for women,' she said.
