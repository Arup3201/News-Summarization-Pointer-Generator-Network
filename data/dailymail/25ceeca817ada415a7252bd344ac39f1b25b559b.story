An anthropologist has found that when it comes to stereotyping the English, the use of the word 'typical' is as much a tell tale sign of nationality as a love of tea and a Sunday roast.

Social anthropologist Kate Fox said the word could almost be a 'national catchphrase', such is its popularity.

Miss Fox, the author of bestseller Watching The English, told the  Cheltenham Literary Festival that a love of 'typical' stems from the collectively enjoyed feeling that the English have the power of foresight over our lives.

Just typical: Social anthropologist Kate Fox said the word 'typical' could almost be a 'national catchphrase', such is its popularity among the English

She described the word as being 'quintessentially English', according to the Telegraph, and said it was suitable as a response to 'any disaster, from a burnt bit of toast to the outbreak of World War Three'. 

She added: ‘You have to be able to say it in a way that sounds simultaneously peeved but also stoically resigned and shruggy.

'And at the same time smugly omniscient - almost pleased that your predictions have been fulfilled. 

Study: Miss Fox's book Watching The English was first published in 2004

'Everything may have gone pear shaped but you have not been taken unawares.'

In her book, first published in 2004, Miss Fox adds that other commonly used English catchphrases included 'oh come off it', 'mustn't grumble', 'Sod's law' and 'bound to rain: it's a bank holiday'.

She has also said that amongst the English, vocabulary can be an indicator of class, with the higher classes preferring to use 'loo' or 'lavatory' to 'toilet', and 'napkin' rather than serviette'. 

Those in the lower-middle and middle-middle classes eat their food in portions, while upper-middles and above have helpings.

Miss Fox, co-director of the Social Issues Research Centre, also told her audience on Sunday that she had underestimated the ‘magical properties’ of tea - the nation's favourite drink - when she joked about it in the first edition of her book.

She said: ‘Of course, the next thing I saw was that, in the 7/7 bombings in London, concerned shop keepers rushed out to give aid and comfort to the walking wounded.

‘What did they take apart from blankets? Cups of tea.

‘You can imagine those shop keepers looking out and thinking oh God, I’ll put the kettle on.’

Typical 

Oh come off it

Mustn't grumble

Sod's law

Bound to rain: it's a bank holiday

Never mind

Better make the best of it  

There's always something 

As per usual 

I could have told you 

She also spoke about the impact of the internet and social media on our national identity, saying it had helped us become less reserved.

She said: ‘The only thing that’s significantly changed is the advent of social media, where the English lose some of their Englishness. It’s a bit like being drunk.

‘The English online are uninhibited.

‘It’s like you’re down the pub.’ 

And she added that almost one third of English people would not display the Cross of St George because it has become associated with football fans and lager louts,while a quarter were put off by its links to far-Right extremists.

Miss Fox said 83 per cent of the English feel some pride in their country, with only 3 per cent never feeling proud of it.

She told the Cheltenham Literature Festival most in England were ‘closet patriots’, but two-thirds did not know the date of St George’s Day (April 23), and three-quarters did not mark it.
