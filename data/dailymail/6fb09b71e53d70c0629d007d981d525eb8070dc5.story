When an Australian dad pulled off an incredible basketball stunt in his own backyard, his teenage daughter unwittingly made a bet that she will probably regret for the rest of her life.

The footage shows Tim Bower standing with his back to the basketball hoop and holding a ball in his hands while his daughter is filming it as she places the bet.

‘If this goes in, I will not make you pay one more dollar for anything I want,’ she said.

When an Australian dad pulled off an incredible basketball stunt in his own backyard, his daughter unwittingly made a bet

Lobbying the ball over his shoulder, they both did not expect what was going to happen next.

The dad was filmed in a grey top with gym shorts and sneakers as he bends forward before launching the ball over his head and quickly spinning around to see where it lands.

As the ball bounces over the board, it hits the fence and a sigh of relief is heard from the daughter as she films her dad’s stunt but the ball bounces back over the board before going through the hoop.

Mr Bower and his daughter both scream in shock as he quickly turns to his daughter after witnessing an unbelievable stunt before jumping up and down while laughing hysterically.

‘No not that one!’ the daughter is heard yelling in the footage.

He clenches both his hands in the air cheering and saying: ‘did you get that?’

The daughter screams out ‘no' over and over in a disheartened tone of voice but manages to laugh as her dad holds his head thinking that she didn’t catch it on camera.

Without a doubt: The ball flies through the hoop

His daughter placed a bet that he won't have to pay another dollar if he scores

Mr Bower starts questioning his daughter in suspense, whether she caught the fluke shot as he laughs uncontrollably and struggles to get the words out of his mouth.

He points both his middle fingers directly at her as she’s filming him before running off towards the basketball hoop in the distance in excitement.

In a deep tone of voice, she said: ‘No, not that one!’ and starts grunting loudly as she realises she had lost the bet to her dad.

The proud dad said towards the end of the video: ‘this is amazing, I don’t have to pay anything… I don’t have to pay anything!’ as he walks towards the camera before it cuts out.

The video was first posted on YouTube on April 20, 2014 by user Tim Bower, titled: 'Freak Basketball Shot Saves Aussie Dad Millions Of Dollars' and has received over a million hits since.

The suspense was killing him when his daughter kept saying 'no' over and over so he thought she didn't catch it on camera
