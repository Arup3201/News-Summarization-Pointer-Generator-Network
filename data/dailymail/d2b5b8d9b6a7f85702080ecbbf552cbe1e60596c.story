Arjen Robben seems to be the player most renowned for having perfected the art of diving, and the Holland forward revealed he was up to his old tricks on Sunday.

The Dutchman admitted trying to con referee Pedro Proenca in Holland's 2-1 win over Mexico, leading manager Miguel Herrera to brand the 30-year-old a 'cheat'.

Robben apologised for his first-half dive but says his 93rd-minute penalty was genuine, which Klaas-Jan Huntelaar coolly slotted home to book a place in the quarter-final.

So, where does Robben rank? Here, Sportsmail pick 10 other ultimate divers.

Ashley Young

When a dive goes viral and inspires mock-up videos, you know it's bad. And Ashley Young is no stranger to that exact experience.

The Manchester United winger's theatrical dives against Real Sociedad, Aston Villa and QPR - to name a few - involved minimal contact, but were enough to send Young sprawling to the ground.

Young, with online compilation videos at the ready, has been criticised by former United players, including Roy Keane, and has earned an unfortunate reputation.

But the 28-year-old remains unapologetic, saying it's up to the referees to make the right call.

Gareth Bale

The world's most expensive player was criticised for simulation before making his £85million move to Real Madrid from Tottenham, and has taken his nasty habit from the Premier League to La Liga.

It is, of course, easy for defenders to bring such a pacey winger down but Bale, sitting top of the all-time list of Premier League divers, needs little invitation to do so.

The Welsh forward got into a heated debate with Canal Plus reporter Ricardo Sierra after he was accused of diving against Sevilla.

'I was going at pace and to be honest I felt a touch,' said Bale.

'There was no touch,' Sierra replied.

'I felt something,' insisted Bale. 'I thought he was going to pull a leg out on me, so as usual I try and avoid the contact. But, erm, it was not a penalty and we move on.'

Luis Suarez

Luis Suarez, a player with enough black marks against his name to share, goes to ground easier than most.

But the Liverpool striker's latest controversy - biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder to warrant a four-month and nine international game ban - even involved a spot of play-acting.

Suarez, having gnawed at a player for the third time in his career after Otman Bakkal and Branislav Ivanovic, goes down clutching his face and tending to his sore tooth.

It was a different type of dive, one that perhaps saved him from a red card, but Suarez remains insistent: 'I hit my face against the player leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth.'

Rivaldo

Quite the performance from Rivaldo in the 2002 World Cup gifted Brazil the edge as they saw off Turkey in the closing moments of their Group C clash.

Hakan Unsal kicked the ball at Rivaldo's leg while the midfielder was waiting to take a corner deep into stoppage time, only to be sent off as the Barcelona star went down holding his face.

Rivaldo was fined £5,180 and said: 'Obviously, the ball didn't hit me in the race, but I was still the victim. I did not hit anyone in the face. I was both the victim and the person who got fined. Nobody remembers what the Turk did.'

Unfortunately for Rivaldo, we do.

Nani

Nani has come under the microscope during his time at Manchester United for buying fouls, cards and penalties from Premier League referees.

He did it against Newcastle and Tottenham, and was criticised by fans and pundits alike for each, saying the fast-paced winger hits the deck under the slightest of touches.

But former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson came to his player's defence in 2012.

'We have known for quite a few years there are plenty of players diving and, you have to say, particularly foreign players,' said Ferguson.

'Nani is not the type to dive. He has never been that type of player. Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.'

Sergio Busquets

An Oscar-winning performance saw Sergio Busquets play peek-a-boo on the ground during Barcelona's 1-0 win in the Champions League semi-final over 10-man Inter Milan.

Busquets, feigning injury, went down as Thiago Motta raised his arm and supposedly hit his face, earning the Milan midfielder a second yellow card.

It caused uproar, but Busquets thinks differently.

'Play-acting? It's not play-acting, it's being smart,' he told Cadena COPE. 'It's a debate we shouldn't be having, because that's not the real issue. It's all too easy to label people.'

Nevertheless, Jose Mourinho's Inter won 3-2 on aggregate. Justice, perhaps.

Jurgen Klinsmann

Perhaps one of the first footballing stars to be scrutinised for diving after a theatrical tumble saw Argentina's Pedro Monzon receive red as Germany won 1-0 in the 1990 World Cup final.

The now USA coach still disputes the accusations: 'If he didn't make contact with me, how come I had a 15-centimetre gash in my shin?'

Klinsmann has a sense of humour, though, as he celebrated in similar fashion after scoring on his Tottenham debut at Sheffield Wednesday in 1994.

Didier Drogba

Yet another case of peek-a-boo from one of the best footballers on the planet.

Didier Drogba was physical, a beast and feared during his Chelsea days, but had a menacing gift that often left referees with a decision to make in the box.

His most infamous, though, came near the half-way line as Napoli's Salvatore Aronica's elbow hit Drogba on the top of his arm, before the striker went down clutching his face.

Drogba, taking a leaf out of Busquets' book, opens an eye through his hand to check what the referee made of his tumble.

Morten Gamst Pedersen

Morten Gamst Pedersen's dive against Arsenal is enough to earn a place on this list alone. It was, to say the least, strange.

Pedersen, a Blackburn winger at the time, runs through on goal, pursued by Bacary Sagna, before hitting the ground for no apparent reason.

Then, Pedersen looks bewildered as to how he hasn't been awarded a penalty by Phil Dowd.

It was because Sagna was actually a yard-and-a-half behind him as he hit the deck, and Pedersen may have in fact clipped his own heels.

Cristiano Ronaldo

Even the arguably best player on the planet has play-acting in his bag of tricks.

Cristiano Ronaldo, in a hot-blooded Champions League clash with AC Milan, went down holding his face after a brush from Ignazio Abate. The delayed reaction a dead giveaway.

English referee Howard Webb was having none of it, and simply waited for Ronaldo to get to his feet unharmed after an exaggerated roll around.
