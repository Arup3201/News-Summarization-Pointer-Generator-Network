Exactly 100 die-hard chicken fans camped outside a new Chick-fil-A fans restaurant last night for the chance to win free food for a year.

By early Wednesday morning the customers were seen already lining up well in advance of the 6am grand opening in Granite Bay, California on Thursday - nearly 24 hours later.

'It's fun, it's free food for a year,' Darek Daszynsky told CBS13 while standing among various tents and sleeping bags propped up in the parking lot.

Lined up: Dozens of tents were seen packing the restaurant's parking lot on Wednesday in advance of the 6am Grand Opening on Thursday morning

Reward: The first 100 people lined up outside the restaurant on Thursday morning received free Chick-fil-A food for the rest of the year

The first 100 men and women outside the restaurant were said to win $29,000 worth of Chick-fil-A food for the rest of 2013, the Auburn Journal reports.

The promotion is a Chick-fil-A tradition for all its new restaurants, meaning some lined up outside in Granite Bay had done it before.

'I went to Utah twice, I’ve been to L.A., I’ve been to Fresno, Bakersfield, so I’ve gone all over,' said Diane Terry, before quickly added Fairfield to her list as well.

The restaurant's 'First 100' giveaway first started in 2003 in Arizona.

Since then it has handed out $18 million worth of chicken sandwiches, waffle potato fries and soda at around 700 grand openings.

Advantageous: Diane Terry says she's traveled to several Chick-fil-A grand openings across the west coast to take advantage of the appetizing promotion

Giveaways: Since their first giveaway in 2003 the restaurant has handed out $18 million worth of chicken sandwiches, waffle potato fries and soda at around 700 grand openings

Hungry? More than 100 grand openings are still planned with the next in York, Pennsylvania on April 11th

More than 100 grand openings are still planned, Chick fil A spokeswoman Brenda Morrow told the Journal.

The next will be in York, Pennsylvania on April 11th, according to their website.

'It’s better than being at home and being lazy, I can tell you that much,' said Mr Daszynsky. 'It’s good to be out with the community.'

The Granit Bay restaurant says with their new location they've already employed more than 50 people from the area.
