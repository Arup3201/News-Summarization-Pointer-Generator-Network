A recovering anorexic has revealed that he can only bring himself to eat soft foods because he is terrified he might choke on solids.

Marc Corn, who currently weighs just 7st 12, spoke 
out about his condition after NHS figures last week revealed 
hospital admissions for male sufferers of eating disorders had doubled 
since last year.

The 23-year-old, from Basildon, Essex, revealed as a result of his phobia, which was triggered by childhood bullying, he is blighted by panic attacks every time he is confronted with normal meals.

Marc will only eat shakes, hot beverages, chocolate mousse and custard

He said: 'When I was 14 I weighed 17 stone and was tormented by bullies who called me fat.

'I got incredibly skinny, you could see all my bones jutting out. But I preferred looking like that to feeling fat.

'At my skinniest I weighed less than 7 stone. I barely ate anything. But with the help of my family I’m on the road to recovery.'

But Marc's case is not unusual and it is now estimated that 20 per cent of the 1.6million people with eating disorders in the UK are male.

As a child Marc says he used to gorge on 
sweets, chips and kebabs and was a stone and a half overweight by the time 
he was nine, weighing six stone.

But after being targeted by other children at school he gradually became slimmer between the ages of 14 and 19.

Concerned about their son's sudden weight loss, Marc's parents, Daniel, 59, and 
Janice, 50, took him to see an eating specialist who diagnosed him with anorexia.

With the support of his family Marc gradually started eating soft foods, but he still can't bring himself to eat normal meals.

He said: 'I refuse to eat in front of people. But at least I can eat - and that’s something.

'I can’t pinpoint exactly what it is, but I really am scared of eating solid food.'

Marc, who also suffers from cerebral palsy - a neurological condition that affects his movement and coordination that prevents him from working - thanks his family for helping him to 'beat my demons'.

His
mother, Janice, also unemployed due to disability, said: 'We still 
worry about Marc although he says he has it under control.

'I would like to see him put on weight and I like him to eat at the table with the family again.

'He used to eating anything and everything but suddenly stopped after being bullied.

'It’s a long road to recovery but we’re proud that he had recognised his illness.'

Figures from the NHS Information Centre show that last year there were 228 hospital admissions for men and boys with anorexia, bulimia and other eating disorders.

Mary George, spokesman for the Beat eating disorder charity, said: ‘We can’t say for sure that there are more men suffering from eating disorders now but there is certainly more awareness which means more are coming forward for treatment

'There is more pressure on men from magazines with celebrities and male models to have that ideal body image.

‘But there’s still a lot of stigma and misunderstanding because the majority of eating disorders occur in females.

‘That’s why men are ashamed to come forward and admit they have a problem.’
