For years she warned of the devastation TB infection could wreak if it took hold in an alpaca herd.

But now campaigner and alpaca keeper Dianne Summers has been struck down by a severe case of the disease – caught from her own pets.

Ms Summers - who has called for more stringent compulsory tests of the animals amid fears TB might tear through the UK’s alpaca population - was struck down in February with what appeared to be flu.

Struck down: Award-winning alpaca farmer Diane Summers was diagnosed with the life-threatening disease four years after it appeared in her herd

But within eight days her condition had deteriorated into a life-threatening emergency.

Initial tests diagnosed a severe chest infection or pneumonia and doctors prescribed antibiotics.

But after symptoms got worse concerned medics ordered a chest x-ray which confirmed pulmonary bovine TB.

It is thought she may have been 
carrying the disease – while can have a lengthy incubation period - for 
years after eight of the animals put down in 2009 when they tested 
positive for bovine TB.

She said: ‘In 2009 I took all the necessary precautions to protect myself and yet it has happened to me.’

The 51-year-old, from Redruth, 
Cornwall, is now on the road to recovery – despite being hit by serious 
side-effects from the powerful course of medicine needed to fight the 
infection.

She said: ‘I started a nine month 
regime of a cocktail of drugs and was advised the side effects can be 
very unpleasant but at least I can be cured.

‘I was also told I would start to feel better in two to three weeks time.

‘Unfortunately, eight days into the 
course I had severe side effects to the drugs which included severe all 
over body rash – blurred vision – faintness – severe headache and aching
joints and had to seek emergency care.

Recovery: Ms Summers, who is undergoing a nine-month course of antibiotics, believes she caught the disease from her animals and is warning about the dangers of not monitoring the spread of TB tightly enough

‘The drugs were stopped immediately 
and once again I had to go to hospital. I am now on drugs to sort out 
the side effects and once they have cleared then the TB drugs can be 
reintroduced one at a time until we discover which drug caused the 
problem. 

'TB in humans isn’t a quick fix – and it certainly isn’t a case
of two weeks of standard antibiotics and you will be right as rain.

Ms Summers had received an award from 
the British Alpaca Society (BAS), which promotes the welfare of alpacas 
and llamas for the campaign.

She has urged Government bodies to 
close a bovine TB testing loophole which means llamas, alpacas and other
camelids do not need to be tested.

According to the Health Protection 
Agency the risk of humans contracting bovine TB is low. But 500 had to 
be killed after an outbreak in a farm in Burgess Hill, East Sussex, last
month.

Camelids can pose an extra risk to humans because, unlike cattle, they spit a mixture of saliva and gastric fluid.

There are currently 1,500 alpaca owners of an estimated 35,000 animals registered with the British Alpaca Society.

As of April 2012 the number of alpaca 
and llama herds that have been affected by culture confirmed incidents 
of bovine TB in England and Wales was 58, according to Camelid TB 
Support & Research Group.  

The animals, which originally come 
from the high plains of Peru, Bolivia and Chile in South America, are 
normally bred for their wool.

Living in close proximity to animals can bring with it the danger of contract diseases common in the animal world.

There have been numerous cases in Britain where owners have suffered severe and even fatal conditions caught from their pets.

A conservationist from Angus, Scotland, died after contracting Britain's first case of rabies for 100 years - from a bat bite.

David McRae, 56, right, failed to recover from European Bat Lyssavirus (EBL), a type of rabies, for which there is no cure, found in several northern European countries.

Mr McRae, who was licensed to handle bats, was bitten by one of a species known as Daubenton's Bat on at least one occasion.

Rachael Wakefield, 18, from Ashton, Greater Manchester, suffered a mysterious lung disease for five which has left her on oxygen 24 hours a day - until tests showed the symptoms were caused by her pet cockatiel.

Doctors had struggled to find the route of her crippling condition, diagnosing childhood asthma and pulmonary fibrosis.

But specialists at a London hospital discovered she had hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by protein dust from Penni the cockatiel's droppings.

Also known as 'bird fancier's lung', it is harmless to most people but can trigger breathing difficulties in a minority of people.

Doctors say Ms Wakefield's lungs would take two years to properly clear.
