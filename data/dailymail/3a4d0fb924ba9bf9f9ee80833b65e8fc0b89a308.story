One daughter is a global fashion icon who is married to a Prince,  the other has the world’s best-known derriere.

Now Carole Middleton is following in the footsteps of Kate and Pippa – as the inspiration for a new collection of supermarket clothing based on her wardrobe.

The range was created for Asda after customers said they wanted to emulate 57-year-old Mrs Middleton’s ‘elegant’ style. It includes a £35 blue coat which resembles a coat-dress the former air hostess wore to Ascot in 2010.

The original £139 Reiss dress was such a success Kate, 30, borrowed it in March when she visited The Treehouse children’s hospice in Ipswich, Suffolk, to deliver her first public address.

Asda is also selling a black belted dress, costing £14, which is similar to the wrap dress Mrs Middleton, wore to the Royal Wedding after-party in April last year.

The collection also includes a £20 red lace dress based on a £650 Collette Dinnigan design the mother-of-three wore to the Royal Academy’s Summer Exhibition in London in 2009.

Asda’s George label has already benefited from the ‘Kate effect’. Sales of its £22 beige mac soared by 300 per cent after the Duchess of Cambridge was spotted wearing a £650 Burberry version.

The supermarket also saw a  five-fold increase in sales of nude tights after Kate wore a pair. Now it is hoping Mrs Middleton, who runs mail-order company Party Pieces with her husband Michael, will have a ‘Carole effect’.

George’s brand director, Fiona Lambert, said: ‘Carole Middleton is someone who always really gets it right for her age. She’s elegant  and stylish, but with a fashion-forward edge.

‘Our new range has been designed with this sophisticated and ladylike feel in mind. Her style is a perfect example of how you can look great when you are over 40.’

While her outfits have generally been well-received, Mrs Middleton was deemed to have made a fashion faux pas in sporting a fur headband while skiing in Meribel, France, earlier this year.
