Obsessing over the state of your relationship has finally been given a name

And so-called 'Relationship Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder' not only makes you anxious but could also be ruining your sex life, say scientists.

Constantly questioning whether your partner loves you, whether they're the right person for you, or if you even love them at all, are all telling symptoms of the condition.

Relationship Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder not only racks your nerves but could ruin your sex life

Other common behaviors included 
constantly reassessing and doubting the relationship and thinking about and picking at their partner's perceived physical flaws.

Compulsions can involve going to great 
lengths to check that your partner is loyal, such as repeatedly calling 
them, looking at their emails or Internet search histories or endlessly asking them whether they 'really mean it' when they express their love

Those who suffer these symptoms were identified as having relationship obsessive-compulsive disorder (ROCD) by researchers.

And the participants were also found to be less satisfied with their sex lives than those who did not question 
things irrationally, says the new study.

This lower level of sexual satisfaction was explained by a decrease in relationship satisfaction - in other words, it seems that ROCD symptoms reduce relationship happiness, which, in turn, affects sex life, researchers said.

One patients said that although he loved the woman he was in a relationship with, he couldn't stop thinking about whether he might be happier with women he saw on the street, or on Facebook

The findings, which were published online this month in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, could have implications for the treatment of some people with relationship and sexual problems, researchers said.

'ROCD symptoms are often overlooked by family and couple therapists,' said study researcher Guy Doron, of the School of Psychology at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya in Israel.

According to Doron the new findings mean that people's sexual problems might stem from having ROCD and not knowing it, report LiveScience.

Scientists
 say ROCD is a form of obsessive compulsive disorder - a condition that 
can bring unwanted thoughts or worries, and repetitive 
behaviors that are carried out to address those worries, 
usually to no avail.

With
 ROCD, obsessions usually fit into one of two categories: Questioning 
whether you love your partner, or questioning whether your partner loves
 you, said Steven Brodsky, a psychologist and clinical director who has treated patients with ROCD.

For example, one of Doron's patients said that although he loved the woman he was in a relationship with, he couldn't stop thinking about whether he might be happier with women he saw on the street, or on Facebook.

ROCD can also become a self-fulfilling prophecy if the symptoms end up pushing a partner away

It's normal to have some of these thoughts in relationships from time to time, Brodsky said, but a person is considered to have a disorder if the thoughts impair everyday life, such as the ability to do his or her job.

Brodsky also noted that people with ROCD have unwanted thoughts even when there is no rational reason to question the relationship (i.e., their partner really does love them).

Ultimately, these symptoms can lead to rocky relationships. 'These relationships can often repeatedly break up and reunite multiple times a week' or month, Brodsky said.

ROCD can also become a self-fulfilling prophecy if the symptoms end up pushing a partner away.

In the new study, 157 men and women in Israel filled out an online questionnaire intended to assess ROCD symptoms. Couples had been together for about 15 years, on average. Although the survey could not diagnose ROCD, afterwards Doron estimated that about 1 per cent had the condition.

The more severe participants' symptoms were, the more likely the participants were to be unsatisfied with their sex lives.

ROCD symptoms may undermine the ability of a couple to bond emotionally, and lead to stress and sadness, all of which may interfere with pleasure during sex, the researchers said.
