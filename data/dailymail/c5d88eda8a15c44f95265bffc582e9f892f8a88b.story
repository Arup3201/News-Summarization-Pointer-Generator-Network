It's Hot or Not time again as Ian Ladyman reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside.

Finally a referee bucks the trend of poor performances and one of golf's most controversial characters returns in style.

But it's not good news for two of the Premier League's best known strikers.

WHAT'S HOT

MICHAEL OLIVER

Even without Sir Alex Ferguson, Old Trafford remains the hardest place to referee, especially when players are cheating. Oliver's handling of Angel di Maria and Adnan Januzaj on Monday set standards of bravery others should follow. They won't do it.

MASHRAFE MORTAZA

The Bangladesh captain bowled his side to victory over England wearing a brace on both knees. He could hardly run but the 31-year-old said: 'You just have to bear the pain.' It is unclear whether he was talking about his ailing joints or the England team.

DUSTIN JOHNSON

According to legend, Johnson has become the first sex and drugs and rock and roll golfer. Much of what was written during his absence from the game remains unproven. Johnson, for his part, has returned to the tour with victory at Doral.

BLACKBURN ROVERS

The Championship club's draw at Liverpool was deserved and notable for their peculiar sky blue kit. Turns out it's a replica of a Rovers strip first worn in 1882. For once, Blackburn's owners have done something Jack Walker would approve of. It's taken a while.

WHAT'S NOT

DIEGO COSTA

Six months in to his stay in England, Chelsea's gifted striker must decide whether he wants to be a footballer or a pantomime villain. As he does this, it's worth him remembering that when children boo at a pantomime they tend to mean it.

THE THIRD EYE

The decision to give Chris Jordan run out in Adelaide couldn't be proved to be right so was therefore completely wrong. A warning to football here that even the wonders of technology don't make a sport completely immune to the incompetence of the individual.

PETER CROUCH

An enduring Premier League footballer with a lovely wife, a career to be proud of and a reputation as one of the more likeable, grounded guys in sport. And then he posed for a modelling shot with a tiger. Joke or no joke, there is no coming back from that.

PITCH PUNDITS

BT Sport have tried to innovate but, a season-and-a-half in, Jake Humphrey and his friends still look like they are manning a cake stall at a garden fete. Time to get them back inside where Paul Scholes won't need a box to stand on and Steve McManaman's hair can settle down.
