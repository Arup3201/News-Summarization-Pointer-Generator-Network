Goalscorer Scott Arfield is convinced Burnley's performance in their season-opening loss to Chelsea bodes well for the campaign.

The promoted Clarets are among the favourites for relegation from the Barclays Premier League but Arfield believes they gave a good account of themselves against one of the leading title contenders.

Sean Dyche's men showed plenty of enthusiasm in the early stages at Turf Moor and took a 14th-minute lead through Arfield, only for the Blues to roar back and wrap up a 3-1 win before half-time.

The 25-year-old Scot said: 'To play against a top-quality team like that we knew it would be a tough game.

'It was there to see what top players they are and what a top team they are.

'We got an early goal but even after that we were under no illusions as to how tough it was going to be.

'There are definitely positives to take out of it. For us it is still a case of taking one game at a time and there is no disappointment, regardless of this result.

'We're on to the next game now. With the fans behind us anything can happen.'

Arfield savoured his own moment of glory as his crisp strike from the edge of the box flew past Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.

Life has certainly changed quickly for the Scotland B international. Just over a year ago he was released by Huddersfield and when he joined Burnley they were expected to struggle in the Championship.

Arfield said: 'I've waited a long time to play in the top division and I enjoyed it.

'On a personal level that was different class and my family were down here from Scotland to see it too.

'They've stuck by me and they've waited a long time for that too, so it was a really special moment.'

Dyche, the Clarets manager, said: 'It's a fantastic journey Scott's on.

'We plucked him from Huddersfield on a free transfer and he was arguably looking down the barrel of League One.

'We got him in for us and he was fantastic last season. He was excellent all night and that will build belief in players that they can handle this.'
