An extreme dog groomer who dyes her pets' fur, paints their nails and dresses them up in clothes and hair extensions has defended her behaviour.   

Daniela Forshaw, 37, spends £2,000 a month on glamming up her pet poodles and she says her makeovers are completely safe and humane.

'What the public don't realise is groomers' dogs are the best kept in country. It's not cruel. My dog is the best kept in country, just pink,' she said on today's This Morning.

Daniela and her husband of ten years, Mike, share their home in Essex with five dogs. She regularly dresses up their two poodles, Milan and Venice, because she says they love the attention.

However, not all the attention they receive is positive.

Daniela said: 'We do get some negative reactions but when I explain to people how healthy the dog is, and what's really right and wrong and what is actually cruel to a dog, they do start to understand.' 

She explained how she only uses non-toxic products on her pets.

She said: 'Colouring on a dog is like tinted conditioner. It's aloe vera based so it's just like putting a deep treatment on the dog, only with colour.'

She added that the nail polishes she uses to paint the dogs' nails are also non-toxic and they never try to lick it off. They also never try and eat the stickers she puts on their fur to 'furjazzle' them.

A 'furjazzle' is a take on the 'vajazzle' - a beauty treatment made famous by the TV show The Only Way Is Essex.

So it's no surprise that some of the stars of the show, including Jess Wright, have taken their pets to see Daniela for a makeover.

Look at me! The dog is given a glimpse of herself in the mirror

She set up a business as a dog groomer after giving up a stressful City job.

She told This Morning presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford: 'I had spent all of my working life in investment banking and that meant working round clock. I always wanted a dog but didn't have the chance. Then I burnt myself out so I knew I had to have a career change so I took up dog grooming.'

As well as making pampering pooches her day job, she also treats her own pets like royalty.

They have their own bedrooms and are regularly treated to roast dinners and curries.

She said: 'All our money goes on the dogs.' 

Dog groomer Daniela spends £24,000 a year on her doggie makeovers and she's not the only pet owner splashing out.

For many, the costs continue after their beloved pet passes away. 

A new poll has found half of animal owners have held a funeral for their deceased pets, with one tenth of these arranging a formal ceremony to say their final farewells - at an average cost of £105.

The study, conducted by www.perfectchoicefunerals.com, polled 1,608 British adults, all of whom were aged 18 or over and had owned a pet which had passed away within the past year. 

The poll revealed that dogs were mostly likely to have a funeral held for them after their passing, followed by cats and, in third, rabbits.

Emma Simpson of perfectchoicefunerals.com said: 'There are those who may find these costs extraordinary, but to many people the loss of a pet can be just as distressing as losing a family member. What we can see from the results of this survey is that Britain really is a nation of animal lovers and some are even prepared to part with sometimes large sums of money in order to ensure that their pets are honoured in a dignified manner.'
