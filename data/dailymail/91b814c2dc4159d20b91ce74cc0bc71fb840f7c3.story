With the Easter break at the end of the week and spring just around the corner, now is a great time to invest in some fun products that will take you through to the summer. 

The school holidays is the perfect time to get kids involved in baking and they'll enjoy it even more with these fun cookie cutters, and if you need to get organised before the new term starts why not invest in one of Filofax's new notebooks.

Here's our selection of the best products around this week.

SWEET AND CHIC

The My Little Chloe collection is a selection of mini perfumes that are ideal for your handbag or to take on holiday. At only 20 ml, they are also a great way to trial a fragrance. Available in three varieties: the classic Chloe fragrance is floral and fruity while the two additional scents are light and fresh. It’s hard to resist investing in all three!

From £30, Debenhams.

BUNNY BAKE-OFF

School holidays are the perfect time to get creative with your children or grandchildren. These Easter themed cookie cutters are great for home-baking. Biscuits and shortbread make thoughtful gifts for friends and family. The cutters can even be used to make cute sandwiches or toast to entertain little ones at any time of the year.

£8.50, whitestuff.com.

FLEXIBLE FRIEND

Filofax has launched a new line of notebooks with a binding that allows pages to be easily added or taken out. The colourful notebooks come with colour-coded dividers, a ruler and an elastic fastener to keep the book safely shut.

£12.99, filofax.co.uk.

GLOW FOR IT

If your skin lacks luminosity or your make-up is too matte, try Rimmel’s Good To Glow highlighter. The gel-like formula can be applied anywhere on your face. Or for an all-over holiday-like glow, mix a small amount with foundation and apply as normal. Shade 001 Notting Hill Glow can also give eyelids a subtle metallic sheen.

£4.99, Boots.

POPPING EASTER

Don't fancy an Easter egg? Joe & Seph’s popcorn is a delicious alternative. Available in two new flavours for Easter, caramel & ginger and chocolate trio, just heat in the oven for a tasty treat.

From £4, joeandsephs.co.uk.
