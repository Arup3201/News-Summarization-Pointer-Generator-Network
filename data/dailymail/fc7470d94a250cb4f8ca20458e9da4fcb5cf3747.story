Mobile phones have become an unexpected threat to a rare breed of bird.

A number of mobile apps mimicking the song of the elusive nightjar are diverting the birds from the  nesting.

Now, Dorset Wildlife Trust is launching an online campaign to raise awareness after several incidents were reported of visitors to Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour using the mobile apps.

Visitors to the nature reserve have used apps imitating the unusual 'churring' call of the nightjar to attract the elusive birds so they can be photographed more easily.

The app mimics the distinctive call of the male nightjar, and is usually the only way to know if the birds are about.

Nightjars are usually 28cm long

Average wingspan: 60cm

Average weight: 83g

Can live up to 11 years

Protected in the UK 

Migrate annually  to UK from Africa in April-May

Found in England, Wales and Southern Scotland in summer

A large number of apps imitating the calls of over ,2000 both rare and common birds are available from iTunes and other mobile sites. 

Apps like Bird Songs from Google Android Apps include live field recordings, while iTunes has geographically-oriented  apps that teach users the bird songs of over 2,000 local birds.

Most of these apps are billed as educational, with little thought having been given to the negative effects they might have on mating and migratory birds.

The trust is advising photographers not to use bird apps on any of its 42 reserves and signs have been put up on Brownsea Island to remind visitors.

The nightjar is rare but enjoys a refuge on Brownsea Island where, like all nesting birds, it is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which makes it an offence to intentionally disturb any nesting bird.

In addition, Brownsea Island has special protection area status for the habitats it provides for birds.

The nightjar arrives in the UK in April and May from their wintering grounds in Africa.

It is a nocturnal bird that is usually only spotted at dusk in May or June, when male nightjars put on a demonstrative show of wind-clapping, flying in circles and calling repeatedly in hopes of attracting a mate.

Chris Thain, reserve manager on 
Brownsea Island, said: 'The apps are becoming quite common, and are 
great, but their use needs some guidance, I feel.

'I’m
 sure visitors would be devastated if they realised the possible 
disturbance they were causing to wildlife. We need to spread the word 
that use of these apps is not suitable for nature reserves and can be 
potentially harmful to sensitive species.'

Tony Whitehead, from the RSPB, said: 'Repeatedly playing a recording of birdsong or calls to encourage a bird to respond in order to see it or photograph it can divert a territorial bird from other important duties, such as feeding its young.

'It is selfish and shows no respect to the bird. 'People should never use playback to attract a species during its breeding season.'
