A 'professional mistress' who flaunted her glamorous lifestyle on social media, claiming to have been showered by expensive gifts in her role as a charity worker, has issued a tearful TV apology in China after being arrested in a World Cup betting scandal.

Guo Meimei had a huge following on Weibo, China's answer to Facebook, as she posted pictures of expensive cars and from exotic locations, claiming the gifts were given to her as part of her job as a  Red Cross senior manager.

Guo' s lavish lifestyle was being supported by an illegal gambling operation and also working as a professional mistress for Beijing’s rich and famous

However, after she was arrested under the country's strict gambling laws, she was forced to confess she was a £30,000-a-night prostitute who had sex with China's rich elite for money and had no connection with the charity.

The Red Cross has since struggled for donations since being dragged into the scandal, prompting her to issue an apology on state television, dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit.

'I like to show off,' she said. 'I have the vain mindset of a little girl.'

‘I would like to tell the Red Cross that I’m sorry. I want to apologise even more to those people who are unable to get help.'

Partial to public apologies, the 23-year-old confessed to the gambling-related charges last month after being arrested after a month-long investigation by a special cross-provincial police unit, the South China Morning Post reported.

Guo admitted to operating an illegal gambling venue in Beijing, as well as having sex with men for money.

She also confessed to fabricating that she had a 260 million yuan (HK$327 million) gambling debt in Macau in an attempt to get back into the limelight.

At the height of her fame - or infamy - Guo had almost 1.9 million followers on Weibo who seemed gripped by her love of luxury resorts, fast cars, upmarket restaurants and Macau’s casino tables.

The cyber fame even led her to shoot a self-funded film of her life story last year which detailed how she went from a troubled childhood in Hunan to study at the Beijing Film Academy before becoming entangled in the Red Cross scandal in 2011.

The charity, which unlike its counterparts in other countries is linked with the government, has urged donors on its Weibo page ‘to please forget Guo Meimei’.
