Samir Nasri didn't have the best game in Sunday's Community Shield, but at least he could console himself with the support he had in the stands.

That wasn't from the Arsenal contingent who booed the former Gunners playmaker throughout, but his partner Anara Atanes.

The glamorous model posted a snap on Instagram of herself at Wembley watching the game along with the message 'Wembley stadium! #MCFC'.

Frustrating: Samir Nasri endured a disappointing afternoon at Wembley as he lost out to former side Arsenal

Nasri's side were missing key players for the clash at Wembley but still produced a disappointing display as goals from Santi Cazorla, Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud eased the Gunners to a 3-0 victory.

The 27-year-old would have been frustrated with his display against the FA Cup winners, as he was replaced just after the break by Spaniard David Silva.

One consolation City will take is that the last time they lost out in the Community Shield final they went on to win the league.

Arsene Wenger on the other hand is very optimistic of his side's chances of silverware this season with a plethora of attacking options at his disposal.
