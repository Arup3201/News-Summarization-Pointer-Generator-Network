With its arms outstretched, claws bared and mouth gaping open, this black tiger cub believes it is a fearsome sight - but the act isn't fooling anyone.

The adorable 25-day-old feline was photographed playfully rolling around on a red carpet in the city of Hangzhou, in Zhejiang province of east China.

During the photo-shoot, the cub was also pictured prancing around the room - with photos of cartoon animals, including a lion, adorning the walls.

At one point the cute infant is even seen huddled up to a confused-looking dog, as the animal acts milk-nurse for the cub.

As a black tiger, it is not a unique subspecies - its unusual appearance is the result of pseudo-melanism. 

This occurs where the animal has a black or very dark grey pigmentation of their base coat with light tan or grey stripes.

The thick stripes are so close together that they become barely visible - giving the appearance of one dark fur tone.

Sadly, it is thought that black tigers are actually becoming more common as a result of in-breeding - which causes weakening of healthy genetics.

The term pseudo-melanism derives from pure melanism  - where an animal has a large amount of black pigmentation of the fur and eyes.

This gives it a completely black appearance and is the opposite of albinism.
