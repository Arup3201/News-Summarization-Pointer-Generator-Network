A little Florida pig born without the use of his hind legs was given a second chance at life with a specially-made wheelchair and is now to star in his own television documentary.

Chris P. Bacon, who has over 100,000 fans on Facebook, has been subject to his own children's book and is set to appear in a PBS show, 'My Bionic Pet' on Wednesday night.

His story began when veterinarian Len Lucero adopted the pig when a woman brought Chris to his clinic, wanting to euthanize the one-pound sickly animal.

Television star: Chris P. Bacon, owned by veterinarian Dr. Len Lucero is now set to feature in a documentary that will chart his progress with his wheelchair as he learns how to adapt to life without hind legs

But one look at Chris melted his heart at his Clermont surgery.

'I told her if she surrendered the pig to me, I would try to give it the best life possible,' Lucero said.

Lucero built a tiny rear-end wheelchair out of K'Nex blocks, a children's building toy similar to Legos.

A video posted on YouTube — showing Chris P. Bacon scooting around in his wheeled contraption — went viral. 

To date Chris has appeared on the Today show and Anderson Cooper's daytime talk show.

'He's healthy and happy and that's all you can ask for,' Lucero said to The Ocala Star-Banner.

'I guess I did my job. Beyond that, he inspires me, and as I keep seeing over and over again, he inspires many others as well.

'I hope and really think Chris is inspiring a lot of people but, if nothing else, every person who meets him ends up with a huge smile on their face.'

Lucero, who lives on a farm in central Florida, brought the little pig home to his wife, two kids and menagerie of animals.

The animal's official name became 'Chris P. Bacon' but informally, they called him 'Piggy' Lucero's kids loved him and snapped photos.

The family dog, a black and white Australian Shepherd, became his protector.

The doctor wondered how he could help the pig move easier and considered a set of wheels attached to a harness, similar to what some lame dogs use.

I break for no one: Lucero, who lives on a farm in central Florida, brought the little pig home to his wife, two kids and menagerie of animals

His son had a set of K'nex toys – with wheels and other pieces that snap together – and Lucero built a small cart and cobbled together a tiny harness.

At first, the pig didn't like the harness, but then the tiny animal got the hang of the contraption.

A couple of weeks later, Lucero was at a veterinary conference and met with a representative from handicappedpets.com, a Nashua, N.H.-based company that builds pet wheelchairs, harnesses and carts.

That company built a special wheelchair for Chris and created a Facebook page for the pig.

Lucero and his family take him outside several times a day, where he uses his wheels.Inside, Chris has a pen with plush beds where he can scoot around or nap in air-conditioned comfort. During a recent interview, he scarfed down his favorite foods: grapes and Cheerios.
