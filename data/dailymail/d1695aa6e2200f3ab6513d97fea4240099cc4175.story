CCTV may have captured the elusive artist Banksy as he was installing his latest creation in Bristol.

Cameras - ironically set up to deter graffiti artists - filmed two people dressed as workmen unloading kit from the back of a white van in the early hours of Sunday morning.

The video belongs to Broad Plain and Riverside Youth Project - they removed the artwork hours after it was put up, sparking a row over theft - and even leading to the leader receiving death threats.

CCTV may have captured the elusive artist Banksy as he was installing his latest creation in Bristol. Cameras - ironically set up to deter graffiti artists - filmed two people unloading kit from the back of a white van in the early hours of Sunday morning

The elusive artist's work depicts a couple embracing while looking at their mobile phones - he posted it on his website on Monday.

It was quickly spotted on a boarded-up doorway in a wall on a rundown street on the edge of Bristol city centre.

But just hours later it was removed from the wall using a crow bar by members of the nearby Broad Plain and Riverside Youth Project who are now charging people to come and see it.

The financially struggling youth group - who insist Banksy wanted them to have it - plan to sell the work to fund the future of the club, and hope to bring in £100,000.

Leader of the youth club Dennis Stinchcombe MBE, 58, said he has now received death threats after taking around 40 phone calls from angry street art fanatics.

He said: 'People have been calling up and telling us we have no right to take it down, that it is public and we are stealing.

'People have even said they are going to come down here and sort us out.

'They said they are going to do all sorts of nasty things to us. We have even had death threats.'

'He has given it to the club. He couldn't give it to us directly as the gates were locked so he put it as close as he could.

'He has done it to help the right people. I was approached by somebody who knows Banksy very well.

He's an artist himself and he said 'you need to take that Dennis, get it into that club - it's what it is meant for.

A notice where Mobile Lovers once stood, directs people to the youth group if they want to view the work for a small donation

'Banksy never does his street art on pieces of wood - they are always on walls so they can't be taken away.

'We need £120,000 to keep going and our fundraising appeal has so far only brought a few thousand pounds.

'Now we've ended up with a Banksy on our doorstep. It is a dream come true. I'm absolutely buzzing.

'We have taken it off the wall carefully, it isn't damaged at all. If anyone wants to see it they can come in here and put a donation in the box if they feel like it.

'Somebody was saying it is worth £40,000 but I am hoping for £100,000. It has been authenticated on his website but I am going to try to get it officially done as well.

'We will let people come and see it in here for a while then get it to Bonhams for valuation.

'The money will allow us to do everything we could dream of. It will stand us in good stead for the next 120 years.'

The Broad Plain and Riverside Youth Project defended the decision to remove the Banksy and sell it. Left the gate seen in the CCTV and right the artwork on the wall

Visitors today were advised they did not need to donate to the club but many insisted it was what they wanted to do

Bristol City Council said they were not '100 per cent sure of the ownership' of the wall the artwork was attached to.

But today all that was left where it stood was a sign which said: 'The new Banksy piece is being held in our club to prevent any vandalism or damage being done.

'You are free to come and view but a small donation will be asked of you. Thanks.'

Teenagers at Broad Plain and Riverside Youth Project defended the decision to remove the Banksy and sell it.

Jordan Pawell, 19, has been attending the project for 11 years - the last two as a youth worker.

The teenager, who helped remove the art work, said: 'It is a really good atmosphere here, with lots of activities to do and loads of people to speak to.

'If we hadn't brought it in it would have been taken by someone else and sold privately and then nobody would have seen it then.'

Visitors today were advised they did not need to donate to the club but many insisted it was what they wanted to do.

Engineer Paul Messenger, 52, of Bristol said: 'I don't mind at all, I think it was a sensible thing to do.'It can make money for a good cause. I would suggest it was the right thing to do.'

Mr Messenger's mother, Dorothy Messenger, 90, agreed. 'I enjoyed seeing it, it was very good,' she added. 

Alison Bevan, director of the Royal West of England Academy, the first art gallery in Bristol, described the piece as 'brilliant'.

'I think that the fact it was screwed on to a wall makes it extremely portable and would have increased the likelihood of someone taking it.

'From my point of view, the fact it has come to an organisation like this, that is supporting the local community is better than it going straight to some wealthy collector.'

Mr Stinchcombe added that Bristol City Council, who he believes own the wall, do not like graffiti and would probably have painted over the piece.

A spokeswoman for Avon & Somerset Police said officers were not investigating the removal of the artwork.

The Banksy that appeared on the side of a house on Sunday in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire

'We have not received any reports of a criminal offence,' she said.

However, a police officer and a PCSO visited the centre today and advised the youth club to seek legal advice before selling the piece.

This latest artwork in Clement Street comes just days after a mother-of-five woke up to find a Banksy mural on the side of her rented house on Sunday.

Stunned Karen Smith, 48, heard voices outside in the early hours but thought nothing of it until she spotted men loading huge screens into a van.

She watched them zoom off before finding a painting of three 1950s-style spies on the side of her £300,000 three-bed semi in Cheltenham, Glos.

The men in the picture are carrying listening devices and crowded around a real phone box outside her home.

Mystery man: Banksy appears in his 2011 film Exit Through The Gift Shop

He's the Scarlet Pimpernel of modern art and his true identity remains a jealously guarded secret.

A network of myths has grown up around him. That his real name is Robin Banks. That he used to be a butcher. That his parents don't know what he does, believing him to be an unusually successful painter and decorator.

Then there's the suggestion that Banksy is actually a collective of artists and doesn't exist at all.

Banksy's refusal to reveal himself may have started simply to avoid prosecution for what could be described as acts of vandalism.

However by remaining anonymous he has created an air of mystery which has helped him to become one of the most successful artists of his generation.

He has been photographed in the past but always wearing a mask or hood.

In 2008 he was reportedly 'unmasked' as Robin Gunningham, a former public schoolboy from Bristol with a passion for art. At the time Banksy's agent refused to confirm or deny the story.

Banksy then wrote on his website:'I am unable to comment on who may or may not be Banksy, but anyone described as being 'good at drawing' doesn't sound like Banksy to me.'

Fans had hoped he would finally reveal himself in his spoof 2010 grafitti film Exit Through The Gift Shop - he did appear in the film however he was heavily pixellated.

This photograph apparently shows reclusive graffiti artist Banksy in LA in 2011
