Nick Clegg today admitted his shame at setting fire a collection of rare cacti as a teenager on a school trip to Germany.

The Lib Dem leader said he did a ‘very bad thing’ and he was not proud of the incident in the summer of 1983.

The pro-EU politician claimed that his youthful experimentation with arson while on an exchange trip to Munich was an example of ‘rare anti-Europeanism’.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he was 'not proud' of the incident in the summer of 1983

As a student at the elite Westminster School, Mr Clegg was among several teenagers who travelled to south east Germany 31 years ago to stay with the families of pupils at a school in Munich.

The trip was organised for language students by Richard Stokes, a German teacher at Westminster.

Mr Clegg was sent to stay at with the family of a judge who was also a collector rare cacti.

One night, after getting ‘very drunk’ he ventured into conservatory housing dozens of specimens with schoolfriend Tom Browne.

The future Deputy Prime Minister then took out his out his lighter and starting to singe the ‘beards’ of the priceless plants. Some recall five cacti were damaged, others claim it was as many as 15.

Challenged about claims by BNP leader Nick Griffin that the Lib Dems were led by a ‘convicted arsonist’, Mr Clegg confessed to his crime.

‘I have never been convicted of arson at any time in my life but I did commit a very bad thing when I was a teenager,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘It’s such an odd story, I set light to some cacti, it’s such a surreal thing. In Europe no less, an example of rare anti-Europeanism.’

Questioned about whether drink had been taken, Mr Clegg admitted: ‘I behaved, like many teenagers do, I behaved badly.

‘I was told off. I had to do penance. I had to do a form of community service, digging up flowerbeds in a suburb of Munich. I’m not proud of it.’

Mr Clegg also missed out on cycle rides through mountains and visits to Oberammergau and Nuremberg as part of his punishment.

His teacher, Mr Stokes, said the young Clegg was ‘ashamed’ by his behaviour.

In a 2010 biography of Mr Clegg by journalist Chris Bowers, Mr Stokes said: ‘The judge was incandescent, and we had to decide what to do.

‘I said we should sleep on it. Nick comes out of it quite well, if that’s not too much of a contradiction. ‘He was anguished and very ashamed, gutted by what he had done – he hadn’t realised what he was doing.

‘It wasn’t a wish to inflict clandestine damage – I imagine there was a party going on and then this happened. He was appalled.’ 

Nick Clegg suggested he would not block a referendum in the event of a future coalition

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today hinted he would not stand in the way of David Cameron's plans for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union in a new coalition after the next general election.

The Liberal Democrat leader said there would be more important issues for him - such as "fairer" taxes - in any coalition negotiations in the event of another hung parliament.

His comments come after Mr Cameron said he would not lead another government after the election next year unless there was a commitment to a referendum before the end of 2017.

While Mr Clegg said he stood by his position that there should not be a referendum unless there was a fresh transfer of powers to Brussels, he indicated that it was not a "die-in-the-ditch" issue for him.

'I am going to disappoint you by not now drawing great red lines," he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.

'Are there die-in-the-ditch issues which I have highlighted in the past which I care about, frankly, even more than this? Yes. I think fairer taxes is something I've campaigned for.

'That is something I care about much more than the precise mechanics of when a referendum is held.'

Mr Clegg said that past history suggested there would be changes to the EU treaties which would require a referendum in the UK under legislation passed by the coalition.

'I have always felt that you have a referendum when the time is right, when something happens which merits that referendum," he said.

'If you look back at the development of the European Community, and subsequently the European Union, every few years the rules of the game - these cumbersome treaties - are changed and new decision-making authority is pooled at European level.

'So I think, if history is any guide, it's more than likely to happen again. At that point there should be a referendum, we've guaranteed that in law.'
