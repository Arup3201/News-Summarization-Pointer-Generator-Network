A little boy born without shinbones, knees or ankles is finally able to own his first pair of shoes after being fitted with special prosthetic legs with feet.

Three-year-old Ted Johnson's new legs have feet - unlike his last few pairs.

This week, he tried out his new blue fibreglass prosthetic legs for the first time on the basketball court at the Royal Children's Hospital, in Melbourne, Australia.

Up and about: Three-year-old Ted Johnson tries out his new prosthetic legs with feet

He was born with without shinbones, knees or ankles due to a rare condition called tibial hemimelia

Scans while his mother Abbie was pregnant failed to reveal that Ted was suffering from the rare condition tibial hemimelia.

This is
where there the tibia - the shinbone - is either partially or totally 
missing at birth. The foot may also be deformed or may have additional 
toes.

Ted's condition 
meant his parents, Abbie and Peter, were forced to take the agonising 
decision to have his legs amputated when he was a year old.

The youngster has previously been fitted with two other types of prosthetics, but this is the first set with actual feet.

And
as soon as the new blue fibreglass legs were strapped on with Velcro, 
he was on the move. His mother said: 'He's incredible - nothing stops 
him.

Rare: The condition means the tibia - the shinbone - is either partially or totally missing at birth

Now he has feet, Ted will be able to choose his first pair of shoes

'We thought he might need a 
frame to get around at first, so I can't believe how well he's doing. 
We're going shoe shopping tomorrow for the first time.'

Prosthetist
Jim Lavranos, who made and adjusted each of Ted's three sets of legs, 
said it usually took children up to three or four years to move through 
the progressions of leg extensions.

'He's getting these much earlier than we'd normally do it, just because he's so confident and quick.He'll fly through these.'

Most
legs affected by tibial hemimelia will look 'unusual'. It can occur 
either in one leg or both legs, with 30 per cent of patients having both
legs affected. It is detected at birth, if not before.

Tibial Hemimelia can occur either in one leg or both legs, with 30 per cent of patients having both legs affected

Treatment depends on the exact 
form of the condition. For the mildest form, apparatus may be used to 
lengthen the leg and improve the position of the foot.

In more severe cases, amputation is often considered the best option, followed by the use of a prosthetic leg.

Some
attempts at reconstruction using the fibula have been made, but rarely 
provide a well functioning limb due to instability at the knee and 
problems with the quadriceps (thigh) musculature.
