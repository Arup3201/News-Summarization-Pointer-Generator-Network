Football Association chairman Greg Dyke says there is 'no basis' for the governing body to intervene in the case of convicted rapist Ched Evans.

Evans blamed 'mob rule' for his move to Oldham collapsing on Thursday and for the first time apologised to the woman he was found guilty of raping. However the former Sheffield United striker still maintained his innocence.

Shadow sports minister Clive Efford has urged the FA to cancel Evans' playing registration.

Dyke, speaking for the first time about the Evans situation, said: 'Rape and sexual violence are abhorrent and unacceptable. This cannot be overstated.

'We have reviewed the Ched Evans case in some detail at the FA and we have examined both the legal requirements and our rules and regulations and there is no basis for us to intervene directly in this particular case.

'That said it is important that we continue to look at the issue of behaviour and attitudes within football, and recognise the unique privileges and responsibilities that come with being a participating member of the national game.

'I would encourage the game to consider and discuss this matter and the prospect for future guidelines or codes of conduct. The FA will certainly be considering it in line with our own ongoing review of what constitutes public or private communications and behaviour.'

Efford, referring to the Evans case, said: 'He's fresh out of a conviction for rape and there are plenty of professions to which you would not be able to return, in spite of the fact you'd served your sentence, and I think football is one of them.

'We cannot send the sort of message that it would to young people, that this man's a rapist and it's okay to hold that position - an exalted position in the minds of many young people in the local community.

'The Football Association have the power to revoke his affiliation to the FA, his registration to be able to play football, and I think they have to look at this.'

Evans, 26, said in a statement on Thursday: 'Sadly the 'mob rule' tactics employed by the more radical elements of our society and the constant media reporting has had the desired influence on some sponsors and the club would face significant financial pressure if I joined them.

'The most significant issue for me was that owing to the threat of funding opportunities being withdrawn which may jeopardise the building of Oldham's new stand, it would mean that workers would lose their jobs and others would be put at risk - that would simply not be fair.'

Evans was released from prison last October, halfway through a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011.

He condemned social media attacks on the woman and for the first time issued an apology while still maintaining his innocence.

His statement added: 'I do remain limited at present by what I can say due to the ongoing referral to the Criminal Cases Review Commission and whilst I continue to maintain my innocence, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise for the effects that night in Rhyl has had on many people, not least the woman concerned.

'Finally, it has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine. I wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and I condemn their actions entirely and will continue to do so.'

Oldham's chief executive Neil Joy insisted they pulled the plug on a deal following 'vile and abusive threats, including death threats' to fans, sponsors and staff. Greater Manchester Police said, however, that no reports about death threats or other serious threats had been received.

It is the second time Oldham have pulled out of a deal to sign the striker, whose chances of finding a team willing to take him on now appear limited.
