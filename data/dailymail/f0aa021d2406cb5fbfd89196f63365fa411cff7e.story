Rachel Ellis's twin daughters Lilly and Darcy were born at 37 weeks after surviving a rare condition which meant they shared a placenta in the womb

At 18 weeks pregnant, Rachel Ellis faced a terrifying decision.

When doctors diagnosed her unborn twins with a rare condition they offered pioneering surgery to increase their chances of survival.

The babies shared the same placenta, but an unequal blood supply meant one or both of the twins was unlikely to survive.

The radical operation, which involved surgeons separating the girls using laser technology, gave the twins a 45 per cent chance of surviving to full term.

Doctors inserted a camera and fibre optic laser down a tiny endoscope into Mrs Ellis's womb.

The laser then sealed off some of the shared blood vessels to ensure the girls received a more equal supply of blood.

Just hours after the surgery, doctors feared the worst when at 19 weeks Mrs Ellis's waters broke. 

But remarkably the amniotic sacs re-sealed and the twins were born healthy at 37 weeks.

The stay-at-home mother from Port Talbot in Wales, said she now treasures every moment with her twin daughters.

The mother-of-four said: 'There was no doubt in my mind I wanted the surgery.

'I wanted to go through with it and give them both the best chance at life. 

'I didn't care if they came out with mental or physical problems, I just wanted them alive.

'When they were born I was over the moon. They are just marvellous, I treasure every moment with them.'

Mrs Ellis unexpectedly discovered she was pregnant at seven weeks.

It was at an 18-week scan  at Singleton Hospital in Swansea that medics detected the abnormality.

The condition is known as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, and results in one baby receiving an inadequate blood supply.

Mrs Ellis, said: 'We were told that one of the babies was vacuumed in its sac.

'The consultant explained that one of the twins had about 12cm worth of fluid and the other baby just had 0.4cm, because of this she couldn't move her arms and legs at all.

'That's when he gave me a couple of options, he suggested that perhaps I should consider termination, or the laser surgery.

'I was so upset, I was just crying and all these emotions were just running through me.'

Mrs Ellis was then referred to the Fetal Medicine Unit at St Michael's Hospital in Bristol and underwent surgery three days later.

She was able to watch the whole procedure on a screen, due to the fact she was only under a local anesthetic.

At an 18-week scan doctors diagnosed the condition twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. They told Mrs Ellis radical surgery to separate her unborn babies could give them a 45 per cent chance of surviving to full term

Mrs Ellis, pictured with the twins, her husband Stephen and their older children Crystal and Jay-Jay, said she immediately opted for the surgery. Doctors used a laser to seal off some of the shared blood vessels to ensure the girls received a more equal supply of blood

Despite its success, the mother-of-four and her partner Stephen Ellis, 29, were left on tenterhooks after being warned that they were still not out of danger.

Mrs Ellis was warned that she had a high chance of a miscarriage during the following six weeks.

Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is a disease of the placenta.

The condition only affects identical twins, who share a placenta.

The condition causes the placenta to contain abnormal blood vessels, which connect to the umbilical cords and circulations of the twins.

In many cases the common placenta is shared unequally by the twins, and one may have a share too small to provide the necessary nutrients to grow or even survive.

She said: 'They said the first two weeks would be the worst. The doctors warned that it was likely one or both of the babies would be disabled or ill.

'When I came out of surgery I felt so relieved because they told me the surgery had gone much better than expected. I was so relieved.

'When I got home I could feel the babies kicking away so I was really happy.My belly had got so big - I suddenly looked like I was 30 weeks pregnant.'

Just hours after returning home from the procedure her waters broke, despite being just 19 weeks pregnant.

A test confirmed that the amniotic sacs had ruptured, but miraculously they were able to re-seal themselves.

In spite of the scare the twins were born healthy on September 24, 2013 at Bridgend Hospital in Wales, with Lily weighing 5lbs and her sister, Darcy, weighed in at 5lbs 12oz.

Mrs Ellis, who also has daughter Crystal, six, and son, Jay-Jay, three, said that after the traumatic start to life she values every minute with the girls.

She said: 'Then my waters broke, I was only 19 weeks gone. My sac had ruptured.

But  just hours after the pioneering operation, doctors feared the worst when Mrs Ellis's waters broke when she was just 19 weeks pregnant. But remarkably the amniotic sacs repaired themselves 

Lilly and Darcy were born at 37 weeks. Their mother said: 'It was such a relief to finally get them both home. They are miracles, they are perfect'

'I was rushed to hospital where I was told that the babies were still alive.

'The following morning they did a scan and the doctors told me they weren't expecting to find a heartbeat.

'I didn't believe them though as I could still feel them kicking and I was adamant they would be ok.

'I had the scan and it was an absolute miracle - the sac had refilled and sealed itself. It was amazing.

'I was trying to keep my legs crossed, as then I was thinking that they just couldn't come out but after that the pregnancy was just smooth sailing.

'It was such a relief to finally get them both home. They are miracles, they are perfect.'
