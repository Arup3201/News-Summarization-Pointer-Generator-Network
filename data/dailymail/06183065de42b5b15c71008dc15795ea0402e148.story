Media mogul Harvey Weinstein said that he was 'very lucky' to have never experienced anti-Semitism growing up - after making a rousing speech urging the Jewish community to 'get as organised as the mafia' to tackle the problem. 

The Jewish studio executive, who co-founded film company Miramax before setting up The Weinstein Company, said he had been taught about the issue by his father who had served as a sergeant during World War II.

He made the admission after he gave a passionate speech at the Simon Wiesenthal Center's National Tribute Dinner, where he urged listeners to stand up to anti-Semites and 'kick these guys in the ass'.

In his acceptance speech he urged the Jewish community to get 'as organised as the mafia' to tackle anti-Semitism - although said afterwards he had never personally experienced it

When asked by the New York Post whether he had experienced anti-Semitism he said: 'Personally, no', adding: 'I’m very lucky that way. 

'My dad did, both in the Army and afterwards, so I can only identify and I feel strongly through him. I’ve had a charmed life that way, but I’m still outraged by what’s going on. 

'And we need to know and let the people who are doing those things know they can’t get away with it.'

Jewish: Weinstein said his father, who served during the World War Two, taught their family about the problems faced by Jewish communities around the world 

His father Max Weinstein had helped the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary organisation based in the Middle East which later became the Israeli Defence Force, during the war.

Weinstein, 63, has produced films including The King's Speech, Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds set during the Second World War, and last week accepted the Humanitarian Award at the Simon Wiesenthal Center.

Studies by the institute have shown that the number of attacks on Jewish communities around the world is at its highest since 1945.

The New Yorker used his acceptance speech to tell the audience: 'I think it's time that we, as Jews, get together with the Muslims who are honorable and peaceful — but we [also] have to go and protect ourselves', The Hollywood Reporter wrote.  

'Unfortunately, we [Jews] are gonna have to get as organised as the mafia. We just can't take it any more. We just can't take these things. There's gotta be a way to fight back.'

'While we must be understanding of our Arab brothers and our Islamic brothers,' he added, 'we also have to understand that these crazy b******s [Arab and Islamic extremists] are also killing their own — they're killing neighbours, they're killing people from all sorts of different races. 

'And, unlike World War II, when we didn't act right away and we paid the price, we better start acting now. Trust me, I'm the last guy who wants to do anything about it, but I realize if we don't, we will perish.'
