Five young boys sit in a hospital waiting room in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and the expression on their faces range from fear to curiosity and determination.

They are all set to take part in a traditional mass-circumcision at the Tuanku Mizan Army hospital in the capital.

Circumcision, a rite of passage in the mainly Muslim country, is a major event in the lives of these young boys.

During the mass-circumcisions, dozens of young boys of similar age undergo the ritual surgery together, and are often carried  out during school holidays.

In this instance, 112 boys participated in the event organised by the Ministry of Defence for children of defence personnel.

The boys were given a red-carpet welcome as they arrived at the hospital, with family watching as they went inside.

After the mass-procedure, the boys and their families gather to celebrate their 'passage into manhood'. 

Islam is the main religion in Malaysia, with more than 61 per cent of the population adhering to the faith.
