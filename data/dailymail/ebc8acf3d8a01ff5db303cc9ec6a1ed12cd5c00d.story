A young woman was killed on a dream holiday in Africa after falling from a horse and being dragged 300ft with her foot caught in the stirrup.

Gemma Wilson, 24, died in the arms of her boyfriend, James Langton, who had been planning to propose on the final night of the holiday.

Mr Langton now wears the ring on a chain around his neck.

Miss Wilson’s horse bolted during a 
mountain trek with a small party of tourists. An inquest heard none of 
the 11 people on the trip had been wearing helmets and witnesses said 
they were not offered any.

Miss Wilson, named BT’s Star Graduate
after joining the firm with a combined first class degree, was dragged 
along rocky terrain after her horse tripped on a mountain path in 
Lesotho.

She eventually fell face-first into a 
ditch, unconscious and suffering from massive head and back injuries 
which included bleeding on the brain.

Yesterday, her mother, Jean Clarke, 
accused tour company Imaginative Traveller of putting ‘profits before 
safety’ and urged others planning to book with the company to ‘think 
twice’.

Following the hearing, her father 
Stuart, who is divorced from Mrs Clarke, said he did not accept evidence
his daughter was likely to have died even if she had been wearing a 
safety helmet.

The Nottingham inquest heard that tour guides had not been issued with first aid kits or training, or even mobile phones.

When the hospital was contacted, 
using a fellow tourist’s phone, it did not send a helicopter for four 
hours, until guides had broken in to lockers to get Miss Wilson’s 
insurance details.

Mrs Clarke, 53, said Mr Langton spent 
almost four hours performing mouth-to-mouth while trying to stem the 
flow of blood from his partner’s head wounds.

Although travellers were advised 
before their holidays to take helmets if they wanted to wear one, Mr 
Langton, who lives in Selby, North Yorkshire, told the inquest he saw 
helmets hanging in the stables when they set off on the overnight trek 
to a mountain village.

He added: ‘This was a trip aimed at 
novice riders and I can say with 100 per cent certainty we were not 
given any instructions on how to ride the horse.’

The accident occurred the next  day as they returned to their lodge from the trek in November 2009.

Consultant neurosurgeon Ian Robertson
told the inquest Miss Wilson would probably have died even if she had 
been taken to hospital within 30 minutes.

While a helmet may have lessened the 
initial impact, he said it would not have prevented the injuries caused 
by being dragged along.

Delivering a narrative verdict, 
Nottinghamshire Deputy Coroner Heidi Connor said: ‘The evidence is clear
that this was not horses riding in a straight line over stable terrain.
This was something significantly more risky than that.’

Mrs Clarke said the evidence showed the company ‘failed to provide the most basic care to the people travelling with them’.

Martyn Shapter, of Peak Adventure 
Travel Group, which owned Imaginative Traveller at the time, said they 
expected guides would have given advice and have first aid training.

But the trek, which was provided by a local firm, was not considered to be high-risk.

Dragoman Overseas, the current owner of Imaginative Traveller, now provides the tours in-house.

Notts Deputy Coroner Heidi Connor recorded a narrative verdict, saying: 'I am satisfied that even if Gemma was wearing a helmet, the outcome would have been the same. But I must consider that in other situations this could be the difference between life and death.

'The evidence is that helmets should have been offered as they were available on the day, but this simply did not happen.'

Speaking after the inquest, Miss Wilson's heartbroken father Stuart Wilson, 52, from the Scottish Borders, said that he did not accept the verdict or the findings of the inquest.

'I was looking for closure today, but that doesn’t appear to be the case,' he said. 'I plan to sit down and discuss this with my family and I am looking to appeal this decision.

'Gemma was exceptional and was going to be successful. Her death was devastating and James and the whole family have been traumatised by this.

'I wouldn’t stop my children from going on these adventure treks, but I want to ensure that the number one priority of these companies is the safety of their customers.'
