Andrew Jeffrey Flanagan was sentenced to four years in jail in Texas for a string of offences

The executive whose false CV caused Myer to hire him in a senior position also fooled several other leading Australian retailers who met with him about jobs.

Andrew Jeffrey Flanagan, was fired from Myer on Monday, on his first day as general manager of strategy and business development after the company discovered he had lied on his resume.

He claimed he had held the position of managing director and vice-president of Asia Pacific for Inditex, the Spanish company that owns popular fashion chain, Zara.

However, Inditex contacted Myer on Monday, just hours after Mr Flanagan started work at the company, to inform Myer that Mr Flanagan had never worked for them.

It has since been revealed by the Quest Personnel, the recruitment company that introduced Mr Flanagan to Myer, that several other retailers met with him on the strength of his falsified resume.

'Mr Flanagan was interviewed at length by several leading retailers, all of whom were interested in employing him,' Lorrain Tribe, managing director of Quest told MailOnline.

Mr Flanagan was interviewed by the recruitment company several times and transcripts of those interviews were sent to Myer. Quest also conducted reference checks, contacting local and overseas referees.

It is unclear how Mr Flanagan fooled Myer, Quest and the other companies interested in employing him.

The Australian Financial Review reported that Mr Flanagan seems to be from Searcy in Arkansas and to currently live in Melbourne.

Myer hired Mr Flanagan as general manager of strategy and business development and he began working for the company on Monday, but was fired before the end of the day

Myer CEO Bernie Brooks was not the only one to be fooled, several other companies considered Mr Flanagan for roles at their companies on the basis of his falsified resume

Last night Mr Flanagan resigned from a volunteer position assisting the board of the Nunawading Swimming Club in Melbourne's east.

His nine-year-old son Christopher swims at the club and Club CEO Gary Barclay said Mr Flanagan was 'just a regular dad'.

'His son swims here, in October last year he put his hand up to volunteer to help us with the strategic plan,' he said.

'He's volunteered his time, he's helped out with the club. He put his hand out to help in a specific role.'

Mr Barclay said that Mr Flanagan's resignation was his decision.

'We wouldn't have asked him to step down. He called within half an hour of us becoming aware of [Mr Flanagan getting fired from Myer]. There wasn't time to have a conversation.'
