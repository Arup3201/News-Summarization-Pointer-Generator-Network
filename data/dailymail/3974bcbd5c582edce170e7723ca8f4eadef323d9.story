Three paediatric consultants were criticised by a judge yesterday for suggesting that a baby had been repeatedly shaken by its parents – without giving evidence to back their theory up.

In a case in which a couple faced seeing their three infant daughters being taken into care, the experts said the baby could have been injured after being shaken several times. 

But Judge Heather Swindells said: ‘There was not an iota of evidence to support such a possibility.’

Judge Heather Swindells ordered that the children should stay with their mother and father, who she described as ‘loving, caring parents’ (file picture)

The judge ordered that the children should stay with their 30-year-old mother and 23-year-old father, whom she described as ‘loving, caring parents’, and she cleared them of having harmed their daughters.

Lincolnshire social workers had applied for the girls – one aged two and twins almost a year old – to be taken into care after doctors claimed one of the twins had received a head injury after being shaken.

The girl became limp and floppy while in her father’s arms last November. The family dialled 999, and the child was found in hospital to have fluid on the brain. There were no other injuries.

At the Family Court in Lincoln, the three consultants gave evidence to back up the theory that the baby had been shaken. Dr Stephen Chapman of Birmingham Children’s Hospital, Jayaratnam Jayamohan, of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, and Dr George Rylance, who has retired from the Royal Victoria Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne, cited a 2005 statistical study that found 86 per cent of similar cases were caused by the baby being shaken.

But all suggested the baby may have been injured after being shaken several times.

Judge Swindells said: ‘The universal evidence of health visitors was that the parents are loving, caring parents with good interaction with their children.’

She said the cause of the injury was unknown, and she ‘totally exonerated’ the children’s parents.
