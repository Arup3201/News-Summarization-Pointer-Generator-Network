A 29-year-old soldier who didn't return to his Kentucky military base after visiting his parents in Florida has been reported missing.

Private First Class Daniel Dezinno was last seen leaving the Sarasota home of his mother, Madelyn Shore, on Thursday morning.

Shore said her son should have been back at the Fort Knox post by Friday.

Vanished: Fort Knox soldier Daniel Dezinno has been reported missing after failing to return to the Kentucky military base after visiting his parents in Florida on Thursday

Missing: Daniel Dezinno, 29, was in 'good spirits' when he left his mother's house on Thursday morning

Dezinno had taken leave to visit his father, Ben Dezinno, in Orlando, a friend in Miami and his mother.

Shore said she was 'confused' by her son's disappearance.

'He was in good spirits. He never had any kind of negative remarks about being in the military,' she told Herald-Tribune.

Shore said she asked her son to call her when he returned to the military base.

But when she didn't hear from him by Friday, she called officials at the base who told her Dezinno was a 'no-show'.

That's when 
she alerted the sheriff's office.

Manatee County Sheriff's Office spokesman Dave Bristow said Dezinno's credit card was used on Friday at Disney World and a Texas gas station. His phone had also been disconnected.

Detectives have subpoenaed 
Dezinno's financial records, issued a be-on-the-lookout
alert for his car and plan to request surveillance footage from 
businesses where his credit card is used.

However Bristow said there was no evidence that Dezinno is in danger.

He said this is not the first time a soldier has gone AWOL, citing a similar incident several months ago.

'For whatever reason, they just decide not to show up,' Bristow said.

Police say Daniel Dezinno may be driving a 2005 silver Subaru sedan, like this one, with Kentucky tag 168PHP

Herald-Tribune reported Dezinno joined the Army about a year ago.

His mother said he was in a 'slump', working as a mechanic and living with her before his career change.

He completed basic military training 
in Missouri, moved to a Virginia base and was recently working as a 
mechanic in the motor pool at Fort Knox.

Dezinno is five feet, 
seven inches tall, and weighs 150 pounds. He has brown hair and brown 
eyes. He was last seen wearing shorts, a T-shirt and tennis shoes.

Dezinno may be driving a 2005 silver Subaru sedan with Kentucky tag 168PHP.

Anyone with information is asked to call Detective Stephen Ives in Florida at 747-3011, ext. 2493.
