An abandoned fairground, a school hall covered with gas masks and a deserted nursery - these are the haunting images of a town devastated by nuclear disaster nearly 30 years ago caught on camera by a British photographer.

Amateur photographer, Ryan Field, 26, from East Sussex, took the photos in Pripyat, the city famous for the Chernobyl disaster which shook the world in 1986.

Mr Field, who works as a window fitter had always wanted to photograph Pripyat and hoped that it would be snowing when he planned his visit.

Abandoned: An abandoned fairground, a school hall covered with gas masks and an obliterated nursery - these are the haunting images of a town devastated by nuclear disaster nearly 30 years ago

Deserted: The Chernobyl plant in Pripyat. Amateur photographer, Ryan Field, 26, from East Sussex, took the photos in Pripyat, the city famous for the Chernobyl disaster which shook the world in 1986

Visit: Mr Field, who works as a window fitter had always wanted to photograph Pripyat and hoped that it would be snowing when he planned his visit

He said: 'The city itself isn't scary as such, it's just impressively vast and the silence is the most eerie part.

'Not even birds fly there and it just highlights the true extent of the ghost town that it is.'

Photographing the snowy terrain, once the home of 50,000 people, he said: 'I kept my fingers crossed on the plane that it would be snowy, and as we came through the clouds, I saw a sea of white, and I was ecstatic.

Silence: Mr Field said: 'He said: 'The city itself isn't scary as such, it's just impressively vast and the silence is the most eerie part'

Guide: Being taken around the city with a guide, Mr Field got to step foot inside many buildings although some lots of them are prohibited due to health and safety fears

Accident: The accident occurred during a systems test on April 26, 1986 and created a huge explosion and fire

Bitterly cold: The drive into Pripyat shows the area as snow begins to blanket the land and ice settles on the road

Being taken around the city with a guide, Mr Field got to step foot inside many buildings although some lots of them are prohibited due to health and safety fears.

He said: 'The guards gave me quite a cold welcome at first, but as I was being escorted around the city by a tour guide, they backed off a little giving me a chance to get some great shots in places others may not have been.

He said: 'I feel really lucky that I got to go inside the buildings that by law you are not supposed to enter, after a German tourist fell through a floor there.'

The accident occurred during a systems test on April 26, 1986 and created a huge explosion and fire which 
released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere, 
spreading over western USSR and Europe.

Soviet officials did not report the disaster for several days.

Prevention: Efforts to contain the contamination and prevent a greater catastrophe involved more than 500,000 workers and cost 18 billion rubles

Mr Field said: 'The guards gave me quite a cold welcome at first, but as I was being escorted around the city by a tour guide, they backed off a little giving me a chance to get some great shots in places others may not have been'

Pass: Tourists may obtain day passes, and some workers who are rebuilding parts of the site are allowed in for limited hours only each month

Snow-topped: The snow settles on the trees in the area which has been abandoned for decades following the horrifying accident

Futile: Hundreds of abandoned gas masks can be seen inside a building in Pripyat

Even in the plant workers' town of Pripyat, few knew what had happened 
when the plant's No. 4 reactor blew up around 1.30am in the morning.

The
official acknowledgement came three days later and the  government evacuated 350,000 residents from Chernobyl and Pripyat.

An exclusion zone covering an area of more than 1,000sq miles around the abandoned plant was created to protect people from the effects of any lingering radiation.

Although tens of thousands of people evacuated the area, a few residents refused to leave. A handful of older residents moved back to be close to family graves.

Tourists may obtain day passes, and some workers who are rebuilding parts of the site are allowed in for limited hours only each month.  Scientists say the area will not be safe to live in for another 20,000 years.

The official casualty count of 31 deaths has been disputed and there have also been numerous long-term effects such as cancers and deformities.

Eerie: A swimming pool slowly going to ruins after being abandoned decades ago

Safe: Scientists say the area will not be safe to live in for another 20,000 years
