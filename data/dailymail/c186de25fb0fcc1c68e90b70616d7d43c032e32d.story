A sculpture depicting Jesus as a homeless man sleeping on a bench outside a church has polarized opinion in a North Carolina town.

The piece by Christian artist Timothy P. Schmalz was given to St Alban's Episcopal Church in Davidson by residents who wanted to honor a fellow church member, who passed away in 2007.

And even before its arrival, it caused divided reactions.

Already versions of the sculpture, entitled 'Homeless Jesus', were rejected by cathedrals in New York 
and Canada, but last November Pope Francis 
blessed and accepted it into Vatican City.

Divisive: A bronze statue depicting Jesus as a homeless man sleeping beneath a blanket on a bench outside a church in Davidson, North Carolina has caused mixed reactions from residents

'It's Jesus representing the most 
marginalized of society,' Rev. Doctor David E. Buck, the rector at St. 
Alban's, who approves of the sculpture, told WCNC.

'We're
 reminded of what our ultimate calling is as Christians, as people of 
faith, to do what we can individually and systematically to eliminate 
homelessness. Part of a faith commitment is to care or the needy.'

The bronze sculpture, which costs up to $2,975 depending on its size, shows a figure 
lying beneath a blanket, with his feet visible. They have scars from 
where he was nailed to the cross.

A plaque next to it reads 'Homeless Jesus' and says that the inspiration came from Matthew: 25.

On his website, Schmalz says the 
sculpture is a 'representation that suggests Christ is with the most 
marginalized in our society'.

Approval: Rev. David Buck, the rector at the church, said it reminds people to look after the homeless

Closer to God: Rev. Buck said the statue represents the most marginalized people in society

Dislike: But resident Cindy Castano Swannack said she did not think the sculpture represented Jesus

There
 is also space to sit on the bench, which makes it interactive, and 
other residents say they believe it has brought them closer to God.

'It brings me right up here with Him, yeah,' said Ellen Donaldson. 'It gives me an overwhelming sense of peace and comfort.'

But resident Cindy Castano Swannack told WCNC she called police the first time she drove by it.

'I
 was concerned for the safety of the neighborhood,' she said, adding 
that she did not like how it portrayed Jesus as a 'vagrant'.

'Jesus is not a 
helpless person who needs our help,' she said, 'We need someone who is 
capable of meeting our needs, not someone who is also needy.'

Famous fan: Pope Francis is seen blessing a smaller version of the sculpture at the Vatican last November

Joy: The artist, Timothy P. Schmalz, is pictured left meeting the pope, who praised the sculpture

Creation: Schmalz, pictured, said the piece suggests 'Christ is with the most marginalized in our society'

Despite some reservations, there are no plans to remove it.

Reverend
 Buck added to Davidson News: 'It's here because it’s wonderful art that 
reminds, with this beautiful (church) structure here, that our faith is 
expressed through our concern and care for the homeless. We think it’s 
the perfect place for it.'

In November, he took a wooden version of the same sculpture to the Vatican to present it to Pope Francis.

'The first thing he did when he saw my sculpture was pray, and then he blessed the piece,' Schmalz told CTV News. 'To have Pope Francis bless your sculpture is one of the most amazing experiences possible.'

The model will stay in one of the Vatican houses, and the artist is hoping to find an outdoor location near to St. Peter’s for a full-sized bronze version.
