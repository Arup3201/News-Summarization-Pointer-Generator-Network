Retail chains may be on the lookout for last-minute seasonal workers in the upcoming week. It’s holiday protest time.

Target and Walmart employees, among others, are taking stances against the Thanksgiving and Black Friday shifts imposed on their schedules, which have grown from last year.

One frustrated California Target employee set up an online petition asking the retail giant not to open on Thanksgiving.

Packed house: Shoppers waiting in line at a Target store in Hobart, Indiana, on a Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year in the U.S.

Should stores be allowed to open on Thanksgiving?

That petition on Change.org, titled ‘Target: Take the high road and save Thanksgiving’, now has over 198,000 supporters, up from 100,000 earlier in the day.

‘I have worked at Target for six years and I really enjoy my job,’ writes the petitioner, ‘C. Renee’ of Corona, California. ‘Thanksgiving, though, is one of the three days us retail workers get off a year: a day most all of us spend with family we only get to see on that day.’

In a more aggressive move, Walmart and Sam’s Club workers are getting ready for a national Black Friday walkout.

The campaign, organized by the activist group Making Change at Walmart and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, is planning worker demonstrations in front of dozens of Walmart stores on November 23.

‘Lots and lots of Walmart workers are going to be forced to not have Thanksgiving because they're going to be preparing all day for the busiest shopping day of the year.’ said Dan Schlademan, director of Making Change at Walmart, on a conference call to discuss the upcoming walkouts.

Walmart employees in Maryland recently joined the effort, according to a local Patch.com site.

Thanksgiving and Black Friday protests among retail workers have grown in popularity in recent years.

In 2011, Target employees set up online petitions protesting the long hours they had to work on Thanksgiving. This year the number of petition organizers and petition supporters has noticeably risen as several chain stores have decided to get an earlier start than last year.

Target, Walmart, Sears and Toys ‘R’ Us are all opening their doors between 8 and 9pm on Thursday -- two to four hours earlier than last Black Friday.

As a result, about 40 petitions have popped up on Change.org protesting the earlier openings at those stores, according to ABC News.

‘Target’s opening time was carefully evaluated with our guests, team and the business in mind,’ Molly Snyder, a Target spokesperson, told the Daily Mail in an emailed statement.

‘Across the country, team member preferences were considered in creating our store staffing schedules. Thanksgiving weekend is one of the busiest of the year, and we appreciate our Target team’s flexibility on this weekend and throughout the holiday season.’
