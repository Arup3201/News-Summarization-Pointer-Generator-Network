More partygoers than ever before will see in the New Year with British bubbly as sales for UK-produced sparkling wine continue to soar.

Home-grown fizz has risen to 66 per cent of the UK's total wine production, which is set to be worth almost £100million next year.

Many consumers now favour English and Welsh-produced sparkling wine over French champagne, and the UK now exports bubbly to more than 13 countries.

The large increase in demand has resulted in a vast expansion of vineyards across the UK in the last decade, with more than 4,500 acres now available at 470 vineyards across the country. 

In 2004, there was just 1,879 acres available for wine production in Britain.

Ridgeview Wines, based on the South Downs in Sussex, has reported its best year ever for overseas sales of its sparkling wine.

It now exports to 12 different countries, which makes up 15 per cent of its sales, rising from just two per cent in 2010.

The company aims to double the size of its production from 250,000 to 500,000 bottles in the next five years.

Earlier this month, a bottle of Ridgeview's best Bloomsbury 2011 was served to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their recent tour of New York.

Mardi Roberts, sales and marketing manager of Ridgeview, said: 'We're seeing exports go from strength to strength and it is our ambition to grow this to 30 per cent over the next five years as we double our current productions.

'We are selling our product to twelve countries which would have been unheard of in the English wine industry 20 years ago.

'Exporting is the best step to increase sales and most importantly, raising the profile of Ridgeview and English sparkling wine in general.'

Chapel Down Winery, in Kent, has also seen strong growth internationally with global sales rising over the last five years and more than 50,000 people visiting its vineyards last year.

Frazer Thompson, chief executive, said: 'Brand England' and its food and drink reputation is getting stronger.

'With our wines winning international medals and gaining recognition with leading wine critics, and our production growing rapidly, we are now in a great position to grow our exports.

'At Chapel Down, we have stepped up our international focus – we are exporting to a number of countries, including Hong Kong, Japan, Norway, Finland and Belgium.'

The firm now plans to pump investment into expanding the winery, building a new distribution centre, improving visitor facilities and opening a new brewery.

Both locations, Kent and Sussex, where some of the most famous English sparkling wine originates, are only about 150 miles north of France's Champagne region.

Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said the soaring sales figures prove that the government's long-term economic plan is helping exporters thrive

The North and South Downs benefit from the same chalky soils that are very similar to the earth used to plant grapes for famous names such as Bollinger.

Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said the soaring sales figures prove that the government's long-term economic plan is helping exporters thrive and generate jobs.

She said: 'These figures are testament to the hardworking can-do attitude of our world class food and drink industry and shows the UK is a place the world comes to buy trusted, quality produce.

'There has never been a more exciting time for the English and Welsh sparkling wine industry and I look forward to seeing it go from strength to strength, taking its rightful place alongside champagne.'

Increasing UK exports of sparkling wine has helped grow the Britain's Food and Drink industry, which remains the country's biggest manufacturing sector, greater than cars and aerospace combined.

The food and farming sector is now worth a record £103billion to the UK economy while food and drinks exports now stand at £18.9 billion, the highest ever.

Julia Trustram Eve, marketing director of English Wine Producers, said: 'It is a very exciting time for English sparkling wine, with more producers coming on to the market, more wine available to buy, year on year competition success and moving in to new export markets.

'We've every reason to raise a glass or two in celebration.'
