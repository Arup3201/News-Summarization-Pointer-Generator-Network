Lily Allen is being sued for more than £100,000 by a former tour manager who claims she broke a contract so that an American company could run her money-spinning comeback tour.

EC1 music, whose director is Alex Nightingale, son of Radio 1 DJ Annie Nightingale, filed High Court papers after the singer joined US firm CAA, claiming she was told it could ‘generate higher gross fees’ than EC1.

EC1 Music, which had worked with Miss Allen since 2007, alleges that in May 2012 Miss Allen and Mr Nightingale agreed EC1 would manage a tour spanning 2013 and 2014.

Months later, the singer announced she was pregnant, and is alleged to have told EC1 to continue with tour plans for 2014 and 2015. 

EC1 booked venues but soon after, Miss Allen allegedly told the firm she was joining CAA.

Mr Nightingale argues he is entitled to compensation for the ‘very large amount’ of work carried out, adding there was no break clause in their agreement.

A spokesman said Miss Allen’s lawyers ‘will be defending the matter vigorously’. 

Mr Nightingale was not available for comment.
