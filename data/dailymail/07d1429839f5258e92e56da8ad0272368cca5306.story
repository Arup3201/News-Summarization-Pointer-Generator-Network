Pity the poor souls out there on the highway to hell.

Cars were skidding into ditches or ploughing into snowdrifts … truckers were forced to abandon jack-knifed lorries … people were wrapped in blankets and shivering against the cold.

For up to 13 hours, motorists were stranded on the A23 towards Brighton when a few miserable inches of snowfall turned the road into a skating rink.

But – praise the Lord – salvation was at hand. For the only True Grit that seemed to work was the resolve of a modest group of Christian evangelists, undaunted by the chaos.

They became ‘Angels of the A23’ by working until dawn to help desperate motorists who must have wondered if hell would freeze over before they were rescued.

More than 30 Plymouth Brethren, as they are called, turned out in a fleet of trucks and four-wheel drive vehicles to tow cars to safety, care for shivering casualties and dispense that most quintessentially English of comforts – hot tea and Bakewell tarts.

Yesterday they were hailed as ‘snow saviours’ by those stuck for hours at Handcross, a few miles below the end of the M23 in West Sussex. ‘They were absolutely brilliant,’ one driver said. ‘It would take the council a week to organise something like this. They were angels and everyone was really grateful to see them.’

The Plymouth Brethren is a 200-year-old religious fellowship group without structured hierarchy or  formal membership.

Among those on the rescue mission was Mark MacIntyre, who works in the medical supply industry.

He initially arrived around teatime to find his nephew, who was among those stranded.

Yesterday he said: ‘When I got up here I realised the severity of the situation and organised the others.

‘The road obviously hadn’t been gritted, or the snow was too much, and there were cars stuck as far as you could see. The snow was just blowing across the road and was gradually turning to ice, making it really treacherous.

‘There were about 30 of us with seven 4x4s. It was a kind of rapid response unit … we were on the scene within about 45 minutes.

‘One of the Land Rovers we have has the facilities to make tea and coffee and had plenty of supplies on board, so we were dishing those out to the police as well as people who were stuck in their cars.

‘Everyone was really grateful. A hot drink can mean a lot when you are stuck outside at night.

‘By the time we left at about 4.30am the snow ploughs seemed to be on top of the situation.’

Alas, the Brethren couldn’t reach all parts of the country yesterday.

Despite Highways Agency teams working at ‘full capacity’ through the night, dozens of stranded Sussex drivers bombarded the internet with complaints that they never saw a gritter or a snow plough. 

The chaos caused by Britain’s worst spring freeze for 27 years spread rapidly across the country. As well as the roads, airports and railways were also hit, bringing most of the south east to a standstill. All Eurostar rail services were suspended.

Although snowfall in isolated patches reached 4.7inches, the worst-hit areas of Sussex and Kent experienced only a couple of inches. But thanks to the fact that the snow did not settle but turned to ice as temperatures plummeted as low as -3C, it became unusually treacherous. The AA was expected to have attended more than 15,000 calls by the end of last night – almost double the normal rate. Guernsey and Jersey airports were closed. The Channel Tunnel shut for six hours, causing huge delays on the M20 in Kent.

A ferry carrying 500 passengers from Ireland to France was stranded at sea in high winds off the French coast for nearly 20 hours. Although the Highways Agency insisted it had been prepared for the bad weather, some gritters were unable to salt their usual routes because of obstructions or abandoned cars.

A spokesman said: ‘We knew  this was coming. It was forecast,  we had plans in place and we  followed them.’

Maybe Mother Nature grew a little bored with a classic blanket of white.

So yesterday she put on quite a show, etching amazing shapes in the snow and letting winds and ice carve out the most stunning handiwork.

Paul and Clare Ballard were amazed to find the windscreen of their car transformed into a snow tube or snow roller.

Game of ice marbles anyone? Individual blades of grass bear droplets of water, frozen as they sprayed from a fountain

It was created thanks to a combination of lying snow and high winds, which rolled a layer of snow into the distinctive curled shape before another layer fell on the glass.

The unusual phenomenon requires a precise balance of air temperature, ice, snow, moisture and wind.

The Ballards, from Wickham Market, Suffolk, who found the snow roll on their Nissan, decided against de-icing the windscreen until they had captured its beauty in a photo.

That wasn’t the end to Nature’s calling cards.

Over in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, she left the grass scattered with a collection of ‘ice marbles’.

Blades bore individual bubbles of ice, formed after water spray from a nearby fountain froze as soon as it hit the ground. The spray also decorated a nearby park bench with a fringe of icicles, which formed as the water froze before it could drip off the wood.

Snow tubes are most commonly found in 
the frozen extremes of  North America and are also known as snow 
rollers, snow bales and snow doughnuts.

Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers was delighted at the sight.

‘It looks like the snow has melted slightly and the wind has peeled it off the windscreen, forming a roll, and fresh snow has fallen on to the windscreen,’ she said.

‘I suppose it’s nature’s version of making a snowman.

‘A classic snow roll will happen mostly in North America and in Northern Europe, and they can be as small as a tennis ball or as large as 2ft across –  depending on how strong the wind is and how smooth the surface of the snow is.’
