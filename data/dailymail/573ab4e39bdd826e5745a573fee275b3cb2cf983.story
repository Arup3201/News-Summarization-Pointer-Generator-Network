A man cut a tattoo of a former partner’s name off his own arm to prove to his girlfriend that he was faithful, a court has heard.

Dominic Winner used a Stanley knife to remove the tattoo in front of his then girlfriend, whom he has been found guilty of subjecting to physical and emotional abuse.

The 23-year-old from Hemlington, Middlesborough, was described as ‘violent, jealous, bullying and controlling’ to Teesside Crown Court on Friday.

Prosecutor Nigel Soppitt told the court how Winner’s then-girlfriend, who has not been named, suffered a perforated eardrum and had been threatened with a knife during the abusive relationship.

According to Mr Soppitt, the pair got together last October, but just one month later, the arguments turned into physical abuse.

Mr Soppit described how Winner had ‘pushed her around’, causing her pain and discomfort after blaming her when he missed a doctor’s appointment. He told the court the the couple's arguments got worse and he self-harmed in front of her, was jealous and controlling.

Mr Soppitt said: ‘He took a Stanley knife and cut a tattoo of a former girlfriend’s name to prove he was faithful.

‘A few days later they argued about her use of her phone. He threatened to take her phone, her TV and clean out her bank account.’

As he swore and threatened her, Winner grabbed her right breast, and caused the skin to rip as he twisted it.

She then fell and hit her head, suffering a perforated eardrum as a result.

A few days after this incident, the woman told Winner would leave him, and he then pushed her against the bedroom wall and threw her on to the bed.

Mr Soppitt added: ‘He was looking for his knife, and he told her that she deserved it.’

After the third incident she finally report his assaults to the police and she was photographed covered with bruises.

When Winner was interviewed by police he said: ‘She is making everything ten times worse.’

Winner has previous convictions for assaulting his mother in 2009 and for affray in 2010 when he approached a house in Hemlington with a knife.

Mr Soppitt added: ‘The Crown say that the offences were in aggravated circumstances because they were repeated assaults on the same victim and, in the course of one assault, he said that he was looking for a knife,’

John Gillette, defending, said that Winner had been in custody for five months and he had re-established a relationship with the mother of his children, who had visited him in prison.

He added: ‘There are still issues and attitudes to be addressed and he would very much appreciate assistance with that.’ The judge told Winner that because he had already served the equivalent of a ten-month sentence he would give him a suspended sentence which would allow him to be supervised.

Winner was given a 16-month jail sentence suspended for two years with supervision and a Building Better Relationships programme after he pleaded guilty to two common assaults, an actual bodily harm assault and possession of a knife between November and January.

The judge also imposed a restraining order for eight years banning Winner from contacting, causing harassment, alarm or distress to the girlfriend and two other women associated with her.
