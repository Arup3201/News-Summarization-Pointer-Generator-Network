A schoolgirl who suffers from a rare condition which means she could die at any time has written a heart-breaking bucket list.

Harlee-Jae Procter, from Bacup, Lancashire, told her mother Sasha she wants to ride an elephant, ice-skate with her favourite Frozen character and be a zoo keeper.

The four-year-old has spent much of her short life in hospital due to a rare condition which means that part of a chromosome has been lost or deleted.

Brave: Harlee-Jae Procter, who has a condition which means she could die at any moment, has come up with a bucket list of things she would love to do

As a result the tot has been diagnosed with biliary atresia which causes inflammation of the bile ducts, polycystic kidneys and nephrocalcinosis, a build up of calcium in the kidneys which can lead to fatal renal failure. 

'Harlee-Jae is such a character and people who meet her don't think there is anything wrong with her,' said the mother-of-two.

'After we were told that she could have renal failure at any time, we decided to come up with a list of things she wants to do.

'And I think she realised she could take advantage of it a bit - so there are things on her list that are possible and some things that will never happen.

'It's really scary thinking that the worst could happen to her at any minute so we just want to make as many memories as we can. But I don't let her conditions define her or how she is treated.'

And the youngster - who still wears age 12-months clothes because her growth has been stunted - has already started to tick items off.

She has already flown in an airplane cockpit, met Elmo, and spent the day as a police officer at Rossendale police station where they organised for her to go on a police car ride, a tour of the police station, and take part in fingerprinting and handcuffing.

Sasha said: 'She came up with the bucket list after we were taken to PortAventura in Spain in August by the Make a Wish Foundation to meet Elmo from Sesame Street.

'She had a great time and even got to go in the cockpit of the plane on the flight over.

'Her list is full of things - some are achievable but some will never happen. She wants to ride an elephant, ice skate with Elsa from Frozen, be a zoo keeper and meet Danny Ings.

Poorly: Harlee-Jae Procter was diagnosed with biliary atresia at just four-weeks-old after she was born severely jaundiced

Little fighter: Baby Harlee-Jae Procter in hospital. She has extremely rare diagnosis of microdeletion 17 q12 syndrome which means that genetic information has been lost or deleted

'It's about making memories. I don't want to just sit here crying and let her condition define our lives.'

The brave youngster was diagnosed with biliary atresia at just four-weeks-old after she was born severely jaundice.

She was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary for a Kasai procedure which drains bile from the liver to the gut.

The operation improved her liver function but Harlee will still need a liver transplant before she reaches adulthood.

Frozen: One of Harlee-Jae Procter's wishes is to ice-skate with her favourite Disney character Princess Elsa 

Fun loving: Harlee-Jae Procter, four, doesn't let her potentially fatal condition stop her from doing what she wants. She has come up with a bucket list of things she would like to do

The reception pupil was then diagnosed with polycystic kidneys at six-months, followed by an extremely rare diagnosis of microdeletion 17 q12 syndrome which means that genetic information has been lost or deleted.

And more recently Harlee-Jae was found to have nephrocalcinosis which has to be monitored at monthly hospital visits, and could prove fatal.

The brave girl has to take 15 different types of medication every day - and her condition has also made it difficult to potty train leaving her embarrassed at school.

Sasha, who is also mother to six-year-old Codiee-Lee, said: 'All of this has been going on since she was born and Harlee deals with it really well.

'She doesn't think there is anything wrong with her and thinks I am lying when I tell her - she tells people the scar from her op is from falling off her bike.'
