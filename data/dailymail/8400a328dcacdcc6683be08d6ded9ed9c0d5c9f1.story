A woman has lost a massive 6st after the office clown cracked a joke about her looking like an elephant.

Sharing exciting holiday stories, Anna Grainger, 52, showed a photo on her phone of her riding an elephant in Thailand.

But as soon as her back was turned she could not help overhearing the comment from the joker, 'Which one was the elephant again?'

Anna Grainger showed this photo of her riding an elephant in Thailand to her work colleagues, prompting the cruel comment: 'Which one is the elephant?'

It was the final straw for 17st 7lb Anna, who at just 5ft 2in had a dangerously high BMI of 44.

She decided that it was time to turn her life around by taking control of her eating and her body.

Today she is a healthy size 12 and has lost 6st.

Anna said: 'I had never felt confident in my appearance - I wouldn’t even wear jeans until my thirties as I hated my shape.

'But after I heard that joke I knew it was time to take control.

'As I started to lose weight, my confidence grew and I met my now husband Tim online.

'Setting the date for the wedding spurred me on with my weight loss, and when we tied the knot in June last year I felt amazing as a size 12.'

Anna, from Morton, Lincolnshire, had always been big and cannot remember a time when she ever felt confident in herself.

Her weight spiralled out of control after her first husband died of a heart attack in 2010.

She said: 'I took comfort in a spiral of overeating and it just made me feel worse about myself.

'Looking back, I think I was probably suffering from depression. 

'After the comment at work I decided to go on the Cambridge Weight Plan because I knew a woman that had already been successful.'

Anna’s dramatic diet involved her substituting meals for milkshakes and soups, but it was done safely under supervision from her doctor.

She lost an average of four pounds a week and found her confidence growing.

Before long Anna met Tim online in a car forum and they went on their first date to a Volkswagen car show.

Anna said: 'I was worried what Tim would think of my dieting, but I needn’t have been. He wasn’t afraid to say how lovely I was.

'Tim proposed in September 2012 in Brighton. I saw a vintage dress that I knew was the one but it wouldn’t even go over my head.

'I was determined to get into it and with the wedding on the horizon my resolve strengthened.'

Anna’s son and daughter, Sam and Tamar Miners, 27 and 24, joined her on the CWP and between the three of them they have now lost 12 stone.

Tim and Anna married in June 2013 at Brighton Pavilion.

Anna said: 'It was a wonderful vintage wedding and it even featured on Rockn’Roll Bride blog.

'I had read the blog for years but never dreamt I would be in it.

'I loved being the centre of attention with my lovely husband and this time there wasn’t an elephant in sight.'
