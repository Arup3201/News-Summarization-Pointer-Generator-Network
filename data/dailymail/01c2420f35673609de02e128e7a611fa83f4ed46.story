Jeida Torres, 3, died in Brooklyn after she was allegedly beaten by her mother's boyfriend

The uncle of a man accused of beating a toddler to death in a fit of rage is pleading with the public to know that he is 'not a monster.'

'When I heard about it I was shocked,' uncle Mark Almodovar told The Daily News. 'The kid, he's not that type of person. They said he was a monster - he's not a monster!'

Cops found little Jeida Torres unconscious and unresponsive about 3:50pm Saturday in an apartment in Brooklyn's Bushwick neighborhood. Police had been called by a neighbor who heard the child screaming inside the place.

Jeida had been allegedly 'punched and choked' by Almodovar's nephew, 20-year-old Kelsey Smith, who was babysitting her and her 5-year-old brother Andrew, sources told the Daily News.

Almodovar says Smith only 'backslapped' the girl.

'Sometimes kids don't listen to their parents and they need to be disciplined. But the way he disciplined them was very wrong,' Almodovar said.

Smith's cousin, Tina Torres, told reporters he did everything he could to save the child.  

'He did call his mother crying, saying he just called 911, that she wasn't breathing,' Torres said. 'He called the cops before he left. I called my aunt (Smith's mother) and she was just trying to find his location. She asked him where he was and he refused and hung up on her. She was so upset.' 

Police found Jeida Torres, 3, unconscious and limp on Saturday night. She was rushed to Wyckoff Hospital but didn't survive

Smith has since attempted suicide.

He was dating Torres' mother and allegedly flew into a rage when the 3-year-old accidentally soiled herself.  

'I saw the paramedics run out with little girl wrapped in a blanket,' neighbor Keith Best, 43, told the New York Daily News. 

'Her hands were just hanging out — just limp.' 

The 3-year-old girl was rushed to Wyckoff Hospital in cardiac arrest with trauma to her head and tiny body — but didn't survive.

Her 5-year-old brother Andrew was left covered in bruises from his injuries, according to the Daily News. He was in stable condition Saturday night.

Smith, who has a criminal record, tried to commit suicide by cutting himself but failed, the newspaper reported.

He fled the scene of the alleged beating but was arrested in Queens after someone tipped police off, according to the Daily News.

He remained in custody late Saturday night but has not been charged with a crime.

The mother, Kimberly Torres, had left them with Smith while she went to work. She arrived a half-hour after paramedics were called.

Neighbors say the couple had been fighting violently for two weeks.

One of them, Marilyn Cruz, told the Daily News she'd called police about the fights but got no response 

The mother arrived at the scene 30 minutes after 3-year-old Jeida was rushed to the hospital

Torres and her father sobbed uncontrollably en route to the hospital.

'He was crying — he just lost his mind,' neighbor Keith Best told the Daily News.

The Bushwick building where the tragedy unfolded, 38 Cooper St., is a 16-unit transitional homeless shelter managed by the nonprofit Housing Bridge, records show.
