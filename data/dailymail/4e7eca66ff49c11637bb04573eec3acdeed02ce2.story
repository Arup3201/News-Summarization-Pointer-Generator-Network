Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand was hit in the head by a coin thrown from the crowd as his team's derby clash with Manchester City ended in an ugly clash.

Ferdinand was left bleeding from his left eye following the incident which took place in the aftermath of United's injury-time winning goal in their 3-2 victory at the Etihad Stadium.

In extraordinary scenes, a City fan then ran on to the pitch to 
confront Ferdinand but was restrained by Manchester City's goalkeeper 
Joe Hart. A smoke flare was also thrown onto the pitch.

However, the Premier League star joked about it afterwards, tweeting: 'Whoever threw that coin,what a shot! Can't believe it was a copper 2p....could have at least been a £1 coin!'

He later added on Twitter: 'Respect to Joe Hart for protecting that idiot who ran on!! Love the banter between fans but there is a point when it goes too far...calm it!'

Ferdinand also refused to let the incident keep him away from last night's X Factor final, where he was interviewed from his seat in the audience by host Dermot O'Leary.

Manchester City has apologised to the player and the Football Association has launched an investigation.

Ferdinand's team-mate Ashley Young told MUTV: 'It could have taken Rio's eye out and you've seen the cut on his head.

'When 'Wazza' (Rooney) was taking a 
corner there were so many objects being thrown on to the pitch as well 
and, on another day, if the pitch had not been so wet, the fan who came 
on to the pitch wouldn't have slipped over and could have attacked Rio.'

In a statement, the club said any fans found responsible would be disciplined, adding: 'Manchester City FC security officials are co-operating fully with Greater Manchester Police in relation to events leading up to the throwing of missiles onto the field of play, and between the two sets of supporters, during today's game against Manchester United.

'Manchester City wishes to offer its sincere apologies to Rio Ferdinand. The club unreservedly condemns the actions which led to his being injured.'

United manager
Sir Alex Ferguson said: 'It's just unfortunate... [that] a City fan runs on and then they throw coins at our players.'

City trailed 2-0 but fought back to 
equalise before Robin van Persie's late free-kick secured three points 
for their arch-rivals.

But the match was marred by the serious security lapse - and the arrest of a man over alleged racist chanting.

Greater Manchester Police confirmed after the match that a man was arrested inside the Etihad Stadium following allegations of racist chanting.

The Football Association (FA) confirmed it was investigating the Ferdinand incident.

A spokesman said: 'The FA will liaise with Greater Manchester Police and await the reports of both our crowd control adviser who was present at the game and the match referee.

'It is disappointing that after a great game and advert for the Premier League that we are discussing this issue.

'We will work with the clubs and authorities to identify those responsible and support the strongest sanctions available including life bans.

'We condemn any such acts and it is simply unacceptable that any player is exposed to injury in this way. To witness Rio Ferdinand leaving the field with a cut above his eye to receive treatment is appalling.

'Football in this country has made great progress over recent decades. However, we must maintain the safety and security inside of our stadia and to do this we need to isolate and identify any individuals guilty of offences with strong penalties to act as a deterrent to others.'

Match-winner van Persie was unaware Ferdinand had been injured when he was questioned by Sky's Geoff Shreeves in his post-match interview.

The Dutchman said: 'I missed the thing with Rio so I will have to look back at it but that should not really happen on a football pitch.'

The violent scenes at the end of the Premier League fixture were in contrast to earlier in the match.

According to Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) Twitter feed, there had only been one arrest by 2pm of a suspected ticket tout outside the stadium.

During the game though GMP announced that another man was arrested inside the ground on suspicion of committing a racially aggravated public order offence after officers heard racist chanting.

Earlier, the match commander Supt Craig Thompson said: 'I have every confidence this match will mirror the two derbies last season and the football will be the only talking point.'

Wayne Rooney was also pelted with coins as he took a corner in front of City fans late in the game and, as tempers boiled over, former United player Carlos Tevez kicked out at Phil Jones right in front of United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.

At the final whistle, stewards tries to prevent United's players celebrating in front of their supporters.

People were quick to criticise the incident on Twitter.

CNN reporter Piers Morgan said: 'God almighty - what's just happened to @rioferdy5 is outrageous.'Journalist Kevin Maguire added: 'Life ban and court appearance, please, for idiot who cut Rio Ferdinand's eye with thrown coin. Fab Manchester derby for neutrals.'

And football pundit Mark Lawrenson told BBC Radio Five Live: 'This is not the end we wanted to see - it was a nasty, nasty incident involving Rio Ferdinand and something thrown from the crowd.'

Football fans were debating on Twitter after the final whistle whether Ferdinand had unreasonably provoked Manchester City fans in the crowd when he was hit by the coin.

Arsenal supporter Sabah Chotu said: 'I know it's bad what happened to Ferdinand, but he always provokes the opposition's fans. It's in his nature. Poor attitude since he was a kid.'

But Manchester United fan Giovanna Chevez said: 'Shocking fans saying Ferdinand deserved the coin to the face - wow, I guess it's a crime to celebrate a goal.'

And sports journalist Natalie Bradford added: 'Not good to see Ferdinand hit by a coin, but sadly it now seems a risk you run if you celebrate and therefore incite your rival's fans.'

United led 2-0 at the break thanks to two Wayne Rooney goals, but City drew level through Yaya Toure and Pablo Zabaleta. But Van Persie curled home a last-gasp winner.

The alleged racist chanting incident  joins a number of reports about racial abuse towards football players that have recently plagued the game.

Last month police launched an investigation following complaints over a Chelsea club supporter apparently making a 'monkey' gesture at United striker Danny welbeck during a match at Stamford Bridge.

And two weeks ago Police arrested a 21-year-old man after a supporter appeared to make a monkey gesture at West Bromwich Albion player Romelu Lukaku in Saturday's Premier League match.
