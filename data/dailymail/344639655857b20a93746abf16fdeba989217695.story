A rich Roman nobleman's face has been recreated 2,000 years after he died in a British fortress - and scientists say he looked like a cross between Richard Burton and Sylvester Stallone.

Archaeologists believed the mystery Roman may have been wealthy and had possibly retired from the Army when he died aged about 40.

The skeleton in a stone coffin was unearthed near Newport, South Wales, not far from the Roman fortress at Caerleon.

Scientists have recreated the face of a 2,000 rich nobleman using technology to rebuild his face

Visitors to the exhibit showing off the reconstructed face say it bears a striking similarities to Richard Burton (left) and Sylvester Stallone (right)

Experts used the same technology as police to discover how the face belonging to a murder victim's skull would look.

They first scanned the skull to create a digital model of the Roman's face.

Conservationist Penny Hill then began 
the painstaking work of creating a portrait using materials and 
techniques employed by Roman artists.

Experts used the same technology as police to discover how the face belonging to a murder victim's skull would look.

But this is the first time the technology has been used on someone who lived 2,000 years ago.

The finished portrait shows dark-haired handsome man - likened to filmstar Sylvester Stallone and actor Richard Burton.

The skeleton is on display at the National Roman Legion Museum in Caerleon - with his modern day image.

Museum manager Dai Price said: 'It's great to be able to put a face to the skull we've had on display.

'We are confident the image is as true to life as it can possibly be.'

The remains which date from AD200 were found by builders working on Newport University Campus 18 years ago.

But scientists have now scanned the skull to create a digital model of the Roman's face.

Conservationist Penny Hill then began the painstaking work of creating a portrait using materials and techniques employed by Roman artists.

The portrait was unveiled at a special ceremony at the museum which is on the site of the Roman fortress in the village of Caerleon.

Mr Price said: 'There was a tremendous reaction to the portrait.

'Everyone was fascinated by the face and wanted to get close up.

The Roman Amphitheater at Caerleon in Wales, the most complete in Britain

Wales was the furthest outpost of the Roman Empire.

In AD 75, the Romans built a fortress at Caerleon that would guard the region for over 200 years.

Built in 1850, Caerleon was one of only three permanent fortresses in Roman Britain.Â 

The Ruins include the most complete amphitheatre in Britain and the only remains of a Roman Legionary barracks on view anywhere in Europe.

The fortress itself was a playing-card shape, covering 50 acres of land.

It contains presented Fortress Baths, and the only remains of a Roman Legionary Barracks on view anywhere in Europe.

The barrack blocks are long, narrow L-shaped buildings.

'We have a lot of wonderful objects in our collection but people are really interested in other people.

'I think it's because of the human connection.

'There is something in our natural make-up that allows us to connect to other human beings.'

Staff at the museum are now carrying out DNA tests on the skeleton to discover more about the mystery Roman citizen.

Visitor Michelle Leyton, 24, said: 'It is amazing to think this man was living 2,000 years ago - and that he looks a bit like a cross between Richard Burton and Sylvester Stallone.

'Richard Burton played a Roman in Anthony and Cleopatra - and of course Stallone has the Italian blood.'

The Roman man's skeleton in a stone coffin was unearthed near Newport, South Wales, not far from the Roman fortress at Caerleon, and is now on display nearby

Scientists carried out isotype analysis on the enamel of one of the skeleton's teeth.

That revealed the man in the coffin had spent his childhood years, between the age of five and eight, lived in Wales.

Curatorial officer Dr Mark Lewis said the man was living at a time when the Caerleon Roman fortress was at its height - having been established for 125 years.

It would have been supplying the legion, serving up to 6,000 soldiers.

Dr Lewis said: 'The fact that the man had been buried rather than cremated as most of the people were at that time was a clue to the fact he was probably well off,' he said.

'What we can learn from the latest evidence is that he may have been a very wealthy merchant who may have been supplying the fortress.

'He may have been high up in the administration of the fortress.

'He may have even served in the army and come home to Wales for retirement.'
