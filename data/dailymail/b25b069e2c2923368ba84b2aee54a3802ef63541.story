What do your favourite drinks look like, up close?

To answer that question, Tallahassee company BevShots has revealed its latest ‘alcohol art’ images that reveal the psychedelic nature of drinks and cocktails, ranging from pina coladas to champagne.

Using a microscope, the firm looked under the surface of popular beverages to unearth the unique colours, patterns and shapes that various drinks are made of.

This microscopic picture of Irish Pale Lager was taken in the chemistry department of Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida by local firm BevShots. These colorful pictures of alcoholic drinks reveal the incredible molecules that make up our favourite drinks

The striking images are the result of magnifying liquids up to 1,000 times under a powerful laboratory microscope at Florida State University.

Police officers may soon have a powerful new tool in their campaign against drink drivers.

A laser-based device has been developed that detects alcohol vapour inside a moving car, and it could track down reckless drivers who are over the limit.

The system works by detecting tiny changes in the laser beam as it passes through vapour - and is capable of detecting alcohol at concentrations as low as 0.1 per cent.

Each of the images is on offer as works of art for prospective buyers who want to examine what goes on inside various cocktails.

The incredible shapes and colours of the artwork are then highlighted by shining natural light on top, and through, the bottom of the slide.

The images are then taken using a 35-millimetre camera.

In the images, the various crystalised carbohydrates that have become sugars and glucose are visible.

Each picture is taken by using just a pipette of each particular drink, and placing it on a slide.

This is then placed under a microscope, once the droplets have dried out, and a picture is taken.

The process is not quick, however; it can take four weeks for the alcohol to dry out completely in an airtight container.

In some cases the entire process of drying can take up to three months.

And some alcohols are more difficult to shoot than others – vodka, for instance, does not have as many impurities as a pina colada cocktail.

This means vodka does not always dry out properly, and it can take hundreds of attempts to get the right shot.

Cocktails with fruit and soft drinks, however, have an abundance of citric acids and complex sugars that dry well and make them easier to photograph.

'BevShots are photographs of alcohol under a microscope,' the company writes on their website.

'These high-quality photographs of your favorite beers, wines, cocktails, liquors and mixers were taken after they were crytallised on a slide and shot under a polarised light microscope.

'As the light refracts through the beverage crystals, the resulting photos feature naturally magnificent colors and composition.'

This image takes a microscopic look at champagne. To take the images it was necessary for the alcohol to be dried before it was put on a slide and placed under a microscope. Some types of alcohol, like cocktails, dry quickly and are easy to photograph. Others though, like vodka, are much more difficult as they have a lack of impurities

Tequila, shown here, is much darker than other drinks, due to the high levels of fructose in the tequila from the agave plant. Its colour may also be influenced by the high levels of essential oils, also from the agave plant. The amazing images show how different liquids can appear under the microscope when just a few key ingredients are changed

Here a dirty martini is seen under the microscope. The technique for making these photos dates back to the early 1990s. That was when a research scientist at Florida State University called Michael Davis used the method to get additional funding for his laboratory
