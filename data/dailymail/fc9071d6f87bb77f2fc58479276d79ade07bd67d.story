The Duchess of Cambridge's penchant for smart, feminine maternity wear has sparked a nationwide trend among Britain's other mothers-to-be, according to a new report today.

Department store chain Debenhams has seen sales of sophisticated dresses and smart styles in their maternity collections increase by more than 500 per cent compared to this time last year, and is attributing this to pregnant women wanting to emulate the Duchess' well-documented elegant look.

With not a pair of dungarees, leggings or a smock in sight, the Duchess of Cambridge has continued to paint a picture of elegance throughout her pregnancy.

For her, maternity style has meant neatly tailored coats that skim her burgeoning bump, smart dresses with empire line or wrap styling and just a hint of a higher hemline to emphasise her still-slender legs.

There was no hint of dowdy maternity wear as the Duchess watched the Trooping of the Colours last week in her last royal engagement before the birth, wearing a pale pink coat with pearl buttons and matching hat

Kate managed to combine high-fashion with comfort in the later stages of her pregnancy in a dalmatian print coat and black fascinator hat when she named The Royal Princess at Southampton last week

And Debenhams has reported that its customer is following suit.

No more do pregnant young women want to shroud themselves in yards of fabric, nor do they want to forgo fashion for nine months.

As a result, the store has seen an increase in sales of the very sort of clothes the duchess has been favouring.

Clothing items proving popular include printed blouses in cool cottons and satins (sales up 36 per cent), smart coats and kimono-sleeve dresses (sales up 127 per cent).

Debenhams spokeswoman Michelle Dowdall said: 'Details such as embellishment and soft fabrics are important to our customers, as they want to get the Kate look even whilst pregnant.

'Women seem to be shunning more stereotypical, casual types of maternity wear such as jersey trousers and leggings, and instead want to look and feel their best.'

Kate's fun and fresh take on her style through her pregnancy has clearly inspired other expectant mothers to forgo the usual baggy elasticated look and embrace a more fashion conscious range of maternity wear

Women are also emulating Kate's 
off-duty look, with pretty woven tops and cropped capri trousers selling
well, with some lines up more than 500 per cent.

Due to the popularity of elegant maternity wear styles and shapes, Debenhams is dubbing the trend 'The Duchess Effect'.

Ms Dowdall added: 'We have done a lot of work on our maternity ranges to ensure we are offering customers what they want. Clothes still need to be comfortable, but not necessarily baggy and made from 100 per cent elastic.

'Sales suggest that mums-to-be are waving goodbye to leggings and dungarees, and opting for timeless, stylish maternity wear.'

Debenhams is planning to roll out more formal and occasion maternity styles to keep up with the trend, and cope with customer demand as the season moves into autumn.
