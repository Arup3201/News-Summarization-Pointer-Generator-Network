Steve Backshall has finally met his match - in his Strictly Come Dancing partner Ola Jordan

He's wrestled poisonous snakes, dived with great white sharks and been bitten by a rampaging reptile.

So it might surprise you to learn that adventurer and children’s TV star Steve Backshall has finally met his match – in his Strictly Come Dancing partner Ola Jordan.

The muscle-bound presenter has lodged a complaint with the BBC, claiming she ‘bullied’ him in gruelling practice sessions.

The pair have been assigned a chaperone to follow them around after he refused to be alone with the 32-year-old Polish-born dancer. 

The programme’s bosses were forced to step in after he alleged that she had dented his confidence with her ‘rude and impatient’ manner.

Last night a source close to the show explained: ‘Steve is a very bouncy personality, up for any challenge, but Ola’s harsh treatment has flattened him and made him lose confidence.

‘She was very rude and impatient when he found it difficult to master the shapes for last Saturday’s Charleston.

‘Her choreography and tuition was so tough, Steve resorted to asking other people to show him what he had to do. 

'Ola is a cold and very distant personality, who refuses to mix with Steve’s family and friends,’ the source added.

It is understood that Mr Backshall complained directly to one of the Strictly producers after last Saturday’s Halloween-themed Charleston.

Bosses called Mrs Jordan in for a meeting this week and agreed that she and Mr Backshall will be accompanied at all times while they remain in the competition.

Even before his complaint, there were signs that Mr Backshall, 41, was struggling to keep up with the demanding pace set by Mrs Jordan. 

Last week they were placed near the bottom of the leader-board and the judges remarked on how hard she appeared to have pushed him.

After the wildlife presenter performed a series of forward rolls, complicated lifts and a cartwheel, Darcey Bussell said he was ‘over-challenging’ himself.

Bruno Tonioli criticised Mrs Jordan’s routine for being ‘over-ambitious’ and Len Goodman added: ‘I think you need guts to do that, I really do. You kept going wrong.’

Ever since the competition started, Mr Backshall has struggled with the physical demands of the series.

Last month, he told the Daily Mail he is unable to point the toes of his left foot because his ankle was fused in a near-fatal climbing accident in 2008.

The action star, who was once bitten by a caiman, a reptile similar to a crocodile, revealed he was in ‘constant pain’ during training and took painkillers every day, adding: ‘It has absolutely broken me. 

'You are training all day long on hard wooden floors wearing dance shoes that have no give in them at all, and no cushioning. The impact travels straight all the way through my body and I’m just falling apart.’

He also complained that the constant training affected his social life, saying: ‘I’m actually a little bit disappointed about the fact I’m supposedly in this incredibly high-profile position and I haven’t even got a minute to see my oldest and dearest friends, let alone to go on a date.

‘So it’s been rubbish for that. My dance partner is very, very happily married, so there is certainly no chance of me getting involved like that. 

'And outside of that, not a chance. I have had zero social life.’

A show insider said: ‘Ola is a strict taskmaster. She sees real potential in Steve and thinks he could go the distance in the competition. 

'She took the trophy with Chris Hollins and would love to win again – and with the mums’ and kids’ votes behind them, Steve is a real contender.’
