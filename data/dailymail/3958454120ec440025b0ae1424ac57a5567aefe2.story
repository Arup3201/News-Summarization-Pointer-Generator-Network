One in five travellers is not counted in and out of Britain or checked against terror and criminal watchlists.

Catastrophic IT failures and management blunders mean 20million passengers escape full screening every year.

Launched seven years ago by Labour, the eBorders system was supposed to log every journey to and from the UK.

Fiasco: IT failures and management blunders mean 20million passengers coming in or out of Britain escape full screening against terror and criminal watchlists every year

Yet last night taxpayers were landed with a £500million bill for the unlawful termination of a contract to deliver the scheme.

Despite the huge outlay, only 80 per cent of trips are being logged by what remains of the eBorders programme.

Six million people arriving by train – which includes Eurostar – do not undergo advance checks.

Only 20 per cent of sea journeys are 
logged – the equivalent of ten million passengers slipping through the 
net without having their details compared against lists of killers and 
dangerous fanatics.

Failings: Six million people arriving by train - which includes Eurostar - do not undergo advance checks

Unchecked: Only 20 per cent of sea journeys are logged - the equivalent of ten million passengers slipping through the net without having their details compared against lists of killers and dangerous fanatics

Even 
though airport coverage is 95 per cent, almost four million people still
 arrive every year without having their details checked. The failings 
mean officials are denied the full use of a vital weapon in the fight 
against terrorism.

Sir Charles Montgomery, who runs the Border Force, has told MPs that – when it works – the eBorders system ‘provides extremely valuable information to the intelligence services and to the police’.

The system, however, is unable to fully count people in and out, leaving officials  in the dark about the true scale of illegal immigration. MPs on the Commons home affairs select committee last night vowed to reinvestigate the shambles. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘This is an absolute disgrace. eBorders is a fantastic tool to stop illegal immigrants, dangerous criminals and terrorists coming into the country.

‘It’s been up and running successfully in Australia and Saudi Arabia for years. But because of the absolutely disastrous, catastrophic contract the last Labour government entered into, we have not got it.’

When
 the full plans for eBorders were drawn up in 2007 Labour ministers 
promised to ‘export the border’ to other countries by forcing anyone 
trying to get into Britain to reveal their personal information in 
advance. Passed on by carriers, it is then checked against watchlists 
and security databases and logged on a vast database. Extremists, 
criminals and wanted criminals could either be arrested at the airport 
or turned away.

Alternatively, they can be put under surveillance to identify terrorist plots.

By
 the end of 2013, 95 per cent of all journeys into the country were 
supposed to be covered by the system. This was expected to rise to 100 
per cent by early this year.

But,
 from the outset, the system turned into a shambles. It was delayed by 
EU countries refusing to participate on the grounds that it breached 
Brussels directives, including on data protection.

There are still six airlines on the continent refusing to participate, Sir Charles recently told MPs. In a devastating report, John Vine, the chief inspector of borders, warned the ‘electronic borders’ project had descended into a shambles. Technical problems mean people arriving on ferries, Eurostar trains, cruise ships and small planes are not screened in advance.

And, even when known criminals and illegals are flagged by the system, airports may not be phoned in advance to warn about their impending arrival.

Last night a Home Office spokesman said: ‘The UK’s border security is among the toughest in the world and Advance Passenger Information is just one of a number of checks we carry out.‎ This includes carrying out passport checks on everybody arriving in the UK.

‘New powers in the Immigration Act 2014 will enable carrier and port operator staff to play a role in carrying out these embarkation checks to improve our already robust security at the border.’
