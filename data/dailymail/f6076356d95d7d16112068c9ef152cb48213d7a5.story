You might expect her to be rolling around in the mud with her own brothers and sisters, but this is clearly far from your average pig.

The Lawler family’s Saddleback piglet Runty has formed an amazing friendship with their terrier Alfie in Low Lorton, Cumbria - sleeping in the dog's kennel and even eating food from his bowl.

The duo refuse to be parted - leading sisters Eloise, 13, and Rosie Blue Skye, six, to start walking the unlikely friends together on leads around their village.

Their father Nick Lawler, 44, said: ‘Runty came from a litter of 11, and - as her name suggests - was the runt of the litter. Normally we've found the pigs shy away from other animals.

‘But Runty is quite a perky little character and very fearless. She's three months old now, but two months ago, we found that she kept escaping from her paddock.

‘She had burrowed under the barbed wire fence and we wondered why. But it soon became apparent she had taken a shine to our dog Alfie. We even found her sleeping inside the kennels.

Mr Lawler and his wife Ann, 45, have two other dogs - a Collie called Bramble and a six-month-old Hound puppy, Gladness - but Runty only has eyes for Alfie.

Mr Lawler added: ‘She clearly prefers life on the outside of the paddock, rather than with her family.

‘She hasn't formed a friendship with any of our other pets - there's a cat and three rats but she doesn't care for them. They just really enjoy each other's company.’

Mr Lawler, who owns Winder Hall Country House Hotel near Cockermouth, said the two best friends do ‘a lot of sniffing’ and Runty is ‘always chasing after Alfie’.

He added: ‘Normally a pig would be really guarded, but both seem at ease in each other’s company. I don't like to imagine what goes on inside a pig's mind, but they are really quite intelligent animals.

‘She really does think she's a dog and I think it's been love at first sight for both of them. Maybe there is a romance going on. After all, Runty is a girl. She seems totally unfazed by their differences.

‘She now eats from the dog bowl in the kennels, plays tag with Alfie and enjoys a good tummy-rub from me. A lot of our guests at the hall and our friends think it's amazing.’

Mr Lawler began breeding Saddleback pigs eight years ago and Runty was one of 11 piglets born to father Sheldon and mother Lizzy in June.

He added: ‘They are the talk of the village now.’
