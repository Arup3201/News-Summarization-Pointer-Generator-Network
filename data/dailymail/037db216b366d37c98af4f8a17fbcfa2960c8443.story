With huge demand for tickets, the Paralympics are, like the Olympics, expected to be one of the most successful Games ever.

More than 2.4 million tickets have 
already been sold - half a million of those to overseas visitors. Ten 
thousand tickets will be available each day during the event and the 
Games are on course to be the first Paralympics to sell out.

As
the athletes settled, soprano Denise Leigh performed a tribute song - 
Spirit In Motion - commissioned especially with the motto of the 
Paralympics movement in mind.

It came after the Opening Ceremony presented by Professor Stephen Hawking exploded with the Big Bang in front of more than a billion viewers.

Sir Ian McKellan then portrayed Prospero from the Tempest before Professor Hawking guided the audience and Miranda, a character from The Tempest, through 'the wonders of science' in a variety of narratives inspired by his seminal tome A Brief History of Time.

The cast also includes past Paralympians and injured soldiers. More than 3,000 adult volunteers took part in the ceremony, along with more than 100 children and a professional cast of 100.

Disabled genius: In his instantly-recognisable computerised voice, Britain's greatest living scientist told the audience, 'Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist'

Co-artistic director Bradley Hemmings said: 'Our talks with Stephen Hawking began towards the end of last year.

'We worked very closely with Professor Hawking to develop a series of messages which are very much integrated into the storytelling of the ceremony. We have spent time with him in Cambridge and have been so incredibly gratified with him giving his time.

'Everybody knows about Professor Hawking and his extraordinary theoretical work and writings about science which have made very complex ideas accessible to all of us, but what came through in our meetings with him was the humanity and the humour of him. He is a fun guy.'

The show, called Enlightenment, which features will later urge the 62,000-strong crowd to take part in the world's largest 'apple crunch' as each spectator is given an apple to bite at the same time.

London 2012 creative director Stephen Daldry said: 'This is about challenging perceptions, challenging about who we are.'

London 2012 chief executive Paul Deighton, speaking about the success of the Paralympics, said: 'We've tried to get as many people in as we reasonably can.

'This is a wonderful illustration of how the British public have said we love the Paralympics and want to be part of it.'

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: 'For many Brits, this will be the first time they have seen the Paralympic Games at all.

'It will be a very big moment to really change perceptions and that will be something to be proud of.'
