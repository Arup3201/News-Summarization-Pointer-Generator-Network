Attack: Sam Buttery got in a fight while walking past a restaurant in Soho

A restaurant boss who left a contestant on The Voice requiring plastic surgery after throwing a champagne glass at his head for singing too loudly has been jailed.

Former The Voice finalist Sam Buttery, 22, 'drew attention to himself' when he sang It’s De-Lovely by Cole Porter as he strolled past Nima Safaei’s upmarket restaurant in Soho, central London, once owned by celeb chef Aldo Zilli.

Mr Buttery - who was part of Tom Jones’s team in the first series of the popular BBC talent show - was livid when Safaei, 33, hurled insults at him and told him to 'go to the gym'.

The singer, who went on to star in 
West End Boy George musical, Taboo, retorted: ‘Don’t you know who I am?’
 He then threw the contents of a glass of champagne in Safaei’s face.

Safaei
 then forcefully launched the champagne flute back at Mr Buttery - 
causing a 1.6 inch wound to his head and a cut to his ear.

The
 restaurant boss was jailed for 15 months at Southwark Crown Court after
 he was found guilty of one count of wounding without intent.

Safaei
 was told he would also have to pay £4,000 compensation to Mr Buttery, 
£2,000 costs and a £120 victim surcharge, and his restaurant license was
 suspended for 16 months.

The
 court heard how Mr Buttery’s life had become difficult following the 
attack on June 4th last year and he still endures nightmares today as a 
result.

Peter Zinner, prosecuting, read a 
statement outlining how the reality star had lost both work and weight 
as a result of the attack and was forced to move back into his mum’s 
home in the West Midlands.

The
 statement said: 'The attack has affected me physically - primarily 
causing me to have an artery stitched up in my ear and plastic surgery 
to rectify the damage.

'I have nightmares and terrors since the attack and up to the present day.

'I
 lost two stone in weight and was unable to go out in public places two 
months after the attack without suffering panic attacks. The attack felt
 so unnecessary.

'I lived in London for four years and never experienced anything like the attack before.

'After the attack I moved back to my mum’s place in the West Midlands and it has knocked my confidence so much. Everything has been made so much more difficult.'

Since the attack Mr 
Buttery has had to apply for incapacity benefit as he was unable to work
 and asked his agent to remove him from their records.

During
 the four day trial, the court also heard evidence from Mr Buttery’s 
friend Daniel Lismore - who has been dubbed ‘London’s most outrageous 
dresser’- who was with him at the time.

The
 actor, DJ and stylist, who wore a black hat and cape, told jurors: 'I 
think Sam has had enough of people commenting on his image and he said 
he didn’t understand what makes someone say that.'

Safaei
 had insisted he did not throw the champagne flute and said that he 
simply pushed the glass he was holding back ‘with force’.

Ian
 Dear, in mitigation, said: 'This is the lower end of GBH wounding, 
which can result in life changing injuries. I see nothing about Mr 
Buttery that suggest his life in anyway has changed following this 
offence.

'Mr Safaei is a man
 who has worked all his life. He has a good education and worked as a 
pharmacist, then became a chef and bought a restaurant which has been 
very successful in the years he has owned it.

'He is a professional man, an entrepeneur and what happened that night is completely out of character.'

Mr Dear also told the court how Mr Buttery appeared to be 'very confident' in his evidence, when he performed the Cole Porter song as he described his version of events to jurors.

Safaei, who is Iranian-born and in a long term gay relationship, said Mr Buttery had been 'flirtatious' towards him before the attack, but the judge accepted it was not a homophobic assault.

Judge Martin Beddoe said: 'You claimed to have acted in self defence - you did not.

'There
 is no indication of any expression of remorse on your part, but 
effectively just justification for what you did, and therefore it seems 
to me to demonstrate no understanding on your part of both the incident 
or your responsibility for it.

'On
 the evening of June 4th you took exception to Mr Buttery’s presence 
there and without any provocation you shouted offensive remarks towards 
him.

'I had cause to suspect
 that the reason might have been homophobic - somewhat encouraged by 
your complaint that Mr Buttery was being flirtatious...but as I have 
said I can’t be sure about that, I make it clear I put this to one side.

'You contend Mr Buttery was encroaching on your personal property - no he was not. He was walking down a public highway.

'Your remarks caused him to confront you as to what you were saying and why you were saying it. You did nothing to calm the situation but everything to inflame it by repeating insults towards him.

'It
 was quite a deliberate act and clearly undertaken with some force as 
the glass cut the side of his head, shattered in the process and caused 
severe lacerations in his ear.'

Mr Beddoe said he had suspicious the attack could have been motivated by hostility towards homosexuals.

But he accepted that gay Safaei, who is in a long term relationship, did not glass Mr Buttery as a result of his sexuality.

Neither the TV star or Mr Lismore were present in court for the verdict or sentence.

Ian Dear, defending Safaei, said he was well educated and had worked all his life, initially as a pharmacist and chef before becoming a restauranteur.

He insisted the attack was ‘out of character’ and that Safaei ‘acted impulsively’.

Safaei was also dedicated to charity work for ‘down and outs’ in Soho.

Mr Dear also disputed whether the glassing had been ‘life changing’ for the victim, telling the court: ‘Mr Buttery appeared very confident when he gave his evidence and burst into song.

‘This was at the lower end of grievous bodily harm type wounding which can result in genuine life changing injuries to a person.

‘It may well be Sam Buttery is highly sensitive to that type of comment (about going to the gym).’

Safaei denied all charges, but has been found guilty.
