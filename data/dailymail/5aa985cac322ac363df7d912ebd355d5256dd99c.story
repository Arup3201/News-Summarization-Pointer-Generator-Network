Teen lovers dubbed 'Romeo and Juliet' have been banned from seeing each other and must wear electronic monitors on their ankles after they ran away from home.

A Michigan judge ruled Jayden Thomas, 13, and Braxton Wood, 14, are allowed to return to school but must wear the GPS devices in an effort to stop the pair vanishing again.

The star-crossed lovers from Clare ran away on August 26 after their parents expressed concern about their six-month romance. They were found safe on Sunday - two weeks later - near Chicago.

Neither of the teens spoke during a court hearing on Monday but their families appealed for privacy after the appearance.

'We appreciate the media's response 
in this case; we appreciate their part in helping us get the kids home,'
 said Sarah Wood, a relative of Braxton's. 'It's a really hard time for 
us right now. We do want to thank everybody, but we would appreciate the
 privacy.'

Chuck Foreman, 
whose non-profit missing children search organization had been helping 
in the hunt for the teens, told The Huffington Post that the couple were
 found by a Good Samaritan who spotted their broken-down Ford Explorer.

'In the area they were found in, for being young kids, it was a very dangerous area. They are very fortunate,' Foreman said.

It's not clear if the teens will face any criminal charges. They are scheduled to appear in court again next month.

The missing Michigan teenagers were discovered safe in Chicago on Sunday with Braxton's mother's 2005 SUV.

The
 two young lovers were spotted at a gas station near to Wrigley Firled 
and an anonymous caller informed the Chicago police who arrived to find 
the teens in the back of the vehicle in a parking lot adjacent to the 
station.

Sgt. Tim Edeling of the Chicago police department told ABC News that the SUV battery was dead and the pair had run out of gas.

Private
 investigator, Michael Cook, said that the young teenagers had been 
living in the car for nearly two weeks after they fled with only $80 
between them.

Police did not issue an Amber Alert as they believed Wood and Thomas had runaway together.

Sgt. Edeling said the teens told him they had been 'going to the local Starbucks and enjoying our lakefront'.

However
 Chicago police are trying to gather more information on how the two 
managed to financially support themselves since they left Clare.

They also want to know what they were were doing in Chicago.

Inside
 the SUV, police discovered suitcases belonging to the two, indicating 
that Wood and Thomas had indeed planned their escape.

The Isabella County Sheriff's Department
 said Jayden and Braxton were last seen on Monday, August 26, in Clare, Michigan. Braxton took his mother's Ford Explorer.

Then
 for two weeks, neither family heard anything from them. Both sets of 
parents said the young couple's relationship had grown too serious too 
soon.

They were said to 
have been very upset at the news they would be going to different 
Michigan high schools, which they would have started this week.

Jayden's mother also revealed that she told her daughter she no longer supported the six-month relationship.

Kelly Drinkwine said before the kids were found: 'It's like they fell off the face of the earth. No one can find them.

'She wrote a message for me in lipstick on the mirror saying, "I love you so much, stay happy and beautiful."

Scared: Jayden's mother Kelly Drinkwine, pictured, said: 'It's like they fell off the face of the earth. No one can find them. They are two babies trying to take on the world. There are mean, horrible people out there'

Broke: The teens only had approximately $80, a video game console, a coin collection and other items that could be sold for cash

'They
 are two babies trying to take on the world. There are mean, horrible 
people out there. Just come home, baby. Just come home.'

She said their six-month relationship was too serious and Jayden said she could not live without Braxton.

'That's when I felt I had to bring my daughter back to reality. The day
 she left I told her I no longer supported their relationship.'

Brandon's father Ed Wood told  WZZM13: 'It's like a nightmare. You don't know what to do, where to go or who to call.'

Braxton's mother, Sarah Kiley, said: 'They can't live on their own. They are 13 and 14 years old. They didn't want to do anything but be with each other. It was pretty intense for a 14-year-old. 

Kiley added to ABC: 'We
 looked around the house and realized Braxton was missing and we still 
didn't comprehend it because Braxton hasn't had driver's training. He is
 a young 14, so no drivers' experience whatsoever.'

Missing: The missing posters circulated around the area for the teens who were missing for two weeks

She said she became concerned when the two of them started alienating friends so they could spend all their time together.

'They
 didn't want to hang out with friends. Their focus was each other and 
that's pretty intense for 14-year-olds,' Kiley said, adding that her son
 did not take the news they were going to different high schools very 
well.

'Braxton told us he was heartbroken. We thought that they had cooled and were not seeing each other anymore,' she said.

Their parents believe they only had approximately $80, a video game console, a coin collection and other items that could be sold for cash.

West Michigan private eye Mike Cook was part of the team trying to find the teenagers.

'Trying to find these two has been a little bit more difficult than any of us would have thought,' he said before they were finally discovered. 'They are 13 and 14-years-old, boyfriend and girlfriend. It's our impression they have not made contact with anyone.

He warned that the teens may start 'doing things you don't want to see kids do to make money'.
