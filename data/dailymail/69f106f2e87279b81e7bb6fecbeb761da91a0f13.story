On the evening of February 9 2008, a large fire broke out in Camden Canal Market. After crossing the railway line, the fire spread to the Hawley Arms pub.

The fire was put out during the night by 100 firefighters. It was caused by a banned liquid petroleum gas heater which had been left turned on in a clothes stall.

This morning the area surrounding the market remained sealed off and it is unclear when it will reopen.
