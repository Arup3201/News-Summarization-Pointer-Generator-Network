Upset: Paul Marshallsea, 62, saved some toddlers from a shark but has lost his job because he was off work with stress

When footage emerged of Paul Marshallsea wrestling with a shark to keep toddlers safe on an Australian beach, his bravery won global praise and admiration.

But his seaside heroics failed to impress some back home – namely his employers.

At the time, Mr Marshallsea, 62, was signed off from his job at a children’s charity due to stress and had taken a two-month break in the sunshine with his wife.

However, after seeing the video of him grappling with the 6ft dusky whaler shark, his bosses have terminated his employment due to a ‘breakdown of trust’.

He was informed of his sacking in a letter, which read: ‘Whilst unfit to work you were well enough to travel to Australia and, according to recent news footage of yourself in Queensland, you allegedly grabbed a shark by the tail and narrowly missed being bitten by quickly jumping out of the way.

It continued: ‘The breakdown of the trustees’ confidence and trust in you and your ability to perform the role is so great that we find that dismissal is the only course of action we can recommend.’

Mr Marshallsea, from Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, now fears he will struggle to find a new job.

He said: ‘What am I going to do now? There’s not much call for shark-wrestlers in Merthyr Tydfil.’

Break: Paul, with his wife Wendy and daughter Rachel on holiday in Australia, but his decision to rush into the sea to wrestle a shark has cost him his job

Brave: With no thought for his own safety, Mr Marshallsea grabbed the shark by the tail, narrowly escaping its gnashing jaws, and and dragged it out to deeper water

Incredible: The moment Mr Marshallsea made dangerous contact with the shark was captured by an Australian TV crew filming in the area

He and his wife Wendy, 56, who has 
also been sacked, were both given extended sick leave by the Pant & 
Dowlais Boys and Girls Club where they have worked for ten years.

He said the charity had become so 
successful that he and Wendy, a senior youth worker, were working seven 
days a week and ‘burned out’.

They say they were simply  following medical advice by going to Australia.

The couple were on Bulcock Beach when
a fin was spotted in the water. Hearing cries of ‘Shark!’, Mr 
Marshallsea ran into the waves and pulled the shark away.

Disappointment: Mr Marshallsea with a copy of the letter he received from the charity

Feeling down: Paul says he does not know what to do and has become an unpaid volunteer elsewhere

A TV crew nearby filmed the incident,
which was shown around the world. Yesterday the grandfather said: ‘If I
hadn’t gone in to save the kids on that beach that day my wife and I 
would still have a job … to sack us both without any sort of discussions
first is just disgusting.’

Mr Marshallsea, who earned £18,000 
and his wife, who was on £12,000, said they will not be taking legal 
action against their employer.

The trustees for the club were unavailable for comment yesterday.

Terrible beauty: The striking Dusky Whaler Shark before Mr Marshall seized it by the tail and dragged it from the reach of children

Workplace: Paul and his wife Wendy were working for the Pant and Dowlais Boys & Girls Club here in Merthyr, but trustees say they had to go because they lost 'confidence and trust' in them
