A bridesmaid had more than 100 stitches in her face after being glassed at a wedding party by a guest who was accused of flirting with another woman's husband.

Sarah Cosker, 29, fears she may never smile fully again after the brutal attack in the south Wales seaside town of Aberavon - where she had walked down the aisle with the bride hours earlier.

A court heard her attacker Cherie Morgan, 34, argued with Ms Cosker in the venue's toilets in October last year after married Morgan was accused of flirting with another woman's husband.

They 'exchanged words' in the women's toilets before hairdresser Morgan lashed out, cutting Ms Cosker's cheek and lip with the jagged edge of the glass.

The two women, who were celebrating with the wedding couple at the town's Bar Gallois, knew each other and although they were not friends, they had spoken amicably earlier in the evening.

Mother-of-two Ms Cosker, a bank worker, was left with deep scars on her face and was ashamed to look at herself in the mirror, Swansea Crown Court heard.

In a victim impact statement she told how she has had to have facial muscle reconstruction and nerve repair work, and feared she would never smile properly again.

Prosecutor Brian Simpson said: 'Since the attack she is a totally different person to what she was before.'

Married  Morgan, of Briton Ferry, south Wales, was jailed for four and a half years after she admitted wounding with intent.

She said the attack had been 'almost instantaneous'.

Robin Rouch, defending, said: 'It is her hope that the complainant can make a full recovery as possible.'    

Judge Huw Davies QC told Morgan: 'You left your victim with gross, gaping wounds. They bled profusely - she was terrified.

'She feels unable to face people at work. Her confidence has been shattered.

'What you did can never be condoned or forgiven. There can be no lenient sentence for this offence.' 

Venue: The attack happened in the Gallois restaurant and bar in the south Wales town of Aberavon
