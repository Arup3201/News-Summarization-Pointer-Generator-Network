An Argentine woman has sparked outrage by agreeing to marry her twin sister’s killer.

Edith Casas, 22, is due to wed Victor Cingolani today close to the jail where he is serving 13 years for the murder of model Johana Casas.

Johana was shot dead days before her 20th birthday in August 2010 in the southern Argentine city of Pico Truncado, 1,200 miles south of the capital Buenos Aires.

Cingolani, an ex-boyfriend, was convicted of murder in June.

Edith's family said she is guilty of a 'terrible betrayal'.

The controversial wedding will take place in Edith's home town in front of just two friends acting as witnesses.

However, several armed police officers will also be present when they escort Cingolani from the city jail.

The twins’ mother Marcelina last night claimed her surviving daughter was suffering psychological problems and said she feared Cingolani would take her life too.

She said: 'There are no words to describe what Edith is going to do. She’s guilty of a terrible betrayal.'

Edith, Cingolani’s girlfriend of five years, has insisted her future husband is the victim of a miscarriage of justice and is backing his appeal against his murder conviction.

She said: 'Victor is not a violent person and I’m not mad.

'We’ve got no doubts about what we’re doing. We love each other.'

A second man, Johana’s boyfriend at the time of her murder, will go on trial next year over the killing.

Marcos Diaz was at a party with Johana hours before she appeared dead.

Lucas Chacon, Cingolani’s defence lawyer, insisted: 'The cigarette butts found near Johana’s body belonged to Diaz and all the witnesses have incriminated him.

'I can understand Johana’s parents’ attitude. But Edith is not marrying a killer or anything like it.

'She is marrying a man who was convicted in a judicial scandal. All we want is justice.'
