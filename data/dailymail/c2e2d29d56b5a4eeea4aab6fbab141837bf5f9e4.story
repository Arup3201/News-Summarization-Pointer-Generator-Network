The notoriously private Kate Moss has opened the doors of her London home to cameras to talk through her collaboration with Vogue for her 40th birthday.

Discussing the landmark issue with contributing editor to  Vogue Kate Phelan we catch a glimpse of the less guarded Kate Moss, offering a rare glimpse into the private world behind the very public face. 

Clearly at ease with Phelan, having worked with her numerous times during Phelan's 18 years as Vogue's co-fashion director, Kate laughs over how 'common' her name is before pausing the interview to remove the pink angora sweater she was wearing.

Clearly at ease throughout the interview, Kate laughs and jokes through the questions 

Once a little cooler wearing a black open shirt and strap top, the 40-year-old relaxes into her cream sofa, animatedly discussing the issue which sees her appear a shoot, photographed by Mario Testino, exploring the many different looks she is known for, as well as directing some of her own.

Speaking about her high glamour 'Disco' shot, Kate admits: 'That's what I'd do all the time if I could. every party I have is usually an excuse to get a bit of a show girl outfit on. 

'I love dressing up. Some of the boys don't though! Whenever I tell them there's a theme they're like "oh no".

The fashion chameleon has four pages devoted to her 'favorite things', including her love of 'Dance Moms'

As well as directing shoots staring the men in her life and 40 of her close friends, Kate stars in a shoot, photographed by Mario Testino, exploring the many different looks she is known for 

The interview offers a rare glimpse into the private world behind the very public face 

Four pages of the magazine are devoted to a collage of Kate's carer and personal life, under a title 'A few of my favourite things'.

Revealing she got to keep the entire outfit from her Playboy sixtieth anniversary cover shoot Kate enthuses: 'It's amazing,' It's the same woman whose been making them for 60 years or something so she's been there forever. They are incredibly made.'

The landmark issue to celebrate Kate's 40th birthday was released with two separate cover shots 

The pages also reveal her 'recurring fear' is the paparazzi and that she loves the US reality show 'Dance Moms.' 

Talking about the section she curated in which we are also introduced to the men in her life, from husband Jamie to benefactor Sir Philip Green, shot by David Bailey Kate jokingly says the Topshop boss 'looks like a gangster' in his photo.

Pausing over the shot of ex-boyfriend and Italian photographer Mario Sorrenti Kate describes him as 'her first love'. 

The pair dated in the early nineties and he reported accompanied her to New York to meet with the casting director for Calvin Klein for the campaign which catapulted her career into the stratosphere. 

Remaining good friends, Kate and Mario have worked together many times in her career, but she admits it was meeting fellow photographer David Bailey that really drew Mario to the Vogue shoot.

'It was like a love in! They were so cute- "can I look at your camera?", "what are you dong with that light?" 

Admitting British Vogue now feels like 'home' for her, it seems the warmth is mutual as the fashion bible give her her 36th cover and a record 42 pages

Giggling and smiling throughout the interview, it is clear the model has come into her own as she hit this landmark birthday.
