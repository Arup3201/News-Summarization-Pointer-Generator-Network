A massive multi-national exercise in anti-naval mine training descended on coastlines across the Middle East last week and, in addition, to thousands of sailors from over 40 world navies, some explosives-sniffing California sea lions showed up to show off their skills.

The International Mine Countermeasures Exercise or IMCMEX, the largest exercise of its kind, exists to help preserve the safety of the world's shipping lanes and the global commerce they make possible.

The sea lions equipped with lasers and sonar were deployed for the first time ever to detect and remove objects, as well as secure harbors and hard-to-reach underwater areas.

A total of 44 nations from six continents with more then 6,500 personnel are taking part in IMCMEX. They've gathered from the northern Persian Gulf to the northern Red Sea.

The marine mammal program is several decades old. Dolphins and sea lions were used during the Vietnam War and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

None of the animals were harmed in the anti-terrorist work and they never have to carry live mines.

Instead, they find the devices and place markers on them before Navy divers retrieve and defuse the devices. 

In addition to the impressive sea lions, this year's exercises include aerial vehicles capable of detecting and destroying mines below the water surface. 

The new Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) 'is a sensor system designed to detect, classify and localize floating and near-surface moored mines' according to the official blog of the U.S. Navy.

Unique talents: Sea lions equipped with lasers and sonar are deployed for the first time to detect and remove objects, as well as secure harbors and underwater areas which are hard to reach, according to officials

Not just sea lions; The drill is the world's largest naval exercise with 44 countries from six continents taking part in it with more than 6,500 sailors from the participating navies taking part in the drills which have been broadened to include maritime security operations and protect maritime infrastructure

Thar she blows: The at-sea portion of the exercises, which began this week following a 3-say symposium in Bahrain, has 38 ships, 19 unmanned underwater vehicles, and some 100 divers included from all participating nations

According to Vice Admiral John Miller of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command/U.S. Fifth Fleet, 

The at-sea portion of the exercises, which began this week following a 3-say symposium in Bahrain, has 38 ships, 19 unmanned underwater vehicles, and some 100 divers included from all participating nations. 

'This year’s IMCMEX is significantly more complex than previous editions of this exercise, with more ships, more nations and more Sailors operating as an international force training to protect the world’s sea-lanes,' said Vice Admiral Miller.

Miller emphasized the importance of the area for international commerce.

'Nearly 20 percent of the world’s oil transits through the Strait of Hormuz every day. Imagine the impact on the global economy if suddenly that oil stops flowing because of restricted sea-lanes. This region is clearly important to the whole world,' he said.
