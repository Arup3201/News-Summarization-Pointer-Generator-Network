The Bank Holiday kicked off with a somewhat soggier start than hoped for, as most parts of the UK woke up to washout weather.

Hopes for a sizzling summer weekend all but vanished this morning as torrential rain, thunder and even some hail spread across the country for the start of the three-day weekend.

Southern England and Wales saw some of the worst wet weather, while Bournemouth recorded the highest amount of rainfall in the country - which was more than half its monthly average.

What rain? Tourists in Cambridge didn't let the washout weather stop 
them from enjoying a punt along the River Cam earlier today, as rain 
spread across the country for the first day of the Bank Holiday weekend

Downpours swept across the country, spelling woe for hundrerds of 
families wanting to celebrate the long weekend in glorious sunshine. The
 rain comes at the end of a week which has already seen ferocious 
thunderstorms, hail and localised floods across the south of England

Beaches across the country, including Brighton, were deserted and sunbeds remained unused as people chose to stay indoors and avoid the constant downpours

Usually packed with sun worshippers, dog walkers and swimmers, the
beach was virtually empty. In 
Bournemouth, another seaside town, 28mm of rain fell - more than half 
the town's monthly average

Kelsey and Cerys Smither didn't let the cold wind and rain spoil their 
ice creams as they enjoyed a trip to the beach in Southsea, Hampshire. But the rest of the beach - usually packed at any hint of sunshine - was deserted

The town recorded 28mm of rainfall, more than half the 50mm it expects per month. The south west of England, the south and east of Wales, the south of England and parts of the Midlands also had a particularly bad dose of the wet weather. 

As the rain pelted down, beaches remained virtually empty and usually-packed lidos were deserted.

And it seems those trying to enjoy the long weekend will have to contend with some more dismal weather conditions until Monday, with the Met Office warning that 'nowhere will be dry'.

Although the rain is expected to clear across many parts of the country later today, forecasters predict more rain tomorrow and Monday, in what they have described as an 'unsettled picture'.

Swimmers shunned the outdoor pool at Plymouth Hoe, as the south west, along with the Midlands, Wales and the south east, suffered some of the worst wet weather

Lifeguards at the Peterborough Lido sheltered themselves under giant golf umbrellas as they watched a handful of determined swimmers brave the wet weather

The grey start this morning remained in place for most of the day, although forecasters predict the rain will clear in the south of the country later this evening - before it returns again tomorrow

Weather experts said rain 
is due to ease off in the south and south east of England later this evening but that heavy 
rainfall would continue in the north of England and Scotland.

Scattered showers will then stick around all day tomorrow, leaving much of the country in weather limbo.

But forecasters say there will be some sunshine on Monday, with above-average temperatures 
predicted across the country.

East Anglia, which is expected to be the hottest 
part of the country, is due to bask in 21C temperatures, while the south coast - particularly Devon and Cornwall - will also have some sunshine.

Shoppers in Cambridge propped open their brollies as they braved the bad
 weather, which forecasters say is due to continue over the weekend. Although Sunday and Monday is not expected to be as bad as today, forecasters warned 'nowhere would be dry'

The Met Office said it was an 'unsettled story' for the rest of the 
weekend, with longer periods of rain due throughout next week

But that sunshine could still be dispersed with bouts of rainy weather.

Jay Merrell from the Met Office said: 'There has been rain across most parts of the country today. It is not a very nice day at all.

'And there is now a slightly more pessismistic outlook on the weather for the rest of the weekend.

'The rain is due to ease off later today, particularly in the south and south east, but there is nowhere that can expect to be dry tomorrow.

'Unfortunately it is an unsettled story for the next few days, with longer periods of rain expected into next week.'

The wet weather should not come as a surprise, after last week’s short-lived heatwave was extinguished by storms on Thursday.

Temperatures up to 26C (79F) were replaced by thunder, lightning and an inch of rain, causing road chaos.
