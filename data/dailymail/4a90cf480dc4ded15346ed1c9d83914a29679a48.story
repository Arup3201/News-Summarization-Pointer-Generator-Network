Beachgoers were left astonished after a hammerhead shark gave birth to a litter of pups before their eyes at the water's edge.

A crowd had gathered on the beach in Florida after a fisherman hauled the five foot shark from the water and dragged it towards the sand.

As the creature thrashed around in the shallow water, onlookers spotted the tiny hammerhead pups wriggling in the sea.

The bizarre scene at Panama City Beach was caught on camera in the U.S. yesterday.

Despite repeated attempts to guide the hammerhead back into deeper water, she kept swimming towards the shore.

Local resident Kathy Hunt, who was 
watching on the beach, told local station News 13 that the shark seemed to be 
'looking for a way out and was thrashing around the closer it got to the
 shoreline'.

Park rangers arrived at the beach to take control of the situation.

They tried to coax the shark back into deeper waters, but the shark died around 3pm yesterday.

Shark pups are very independent and often swim away from their mothers as soon as they are born, as these pups did in Florida.

Pups do not receive any further nourishment or support from their parents after birth and fend for themselves in shallow waters,  where they have fewer predators than the open sea.

Female hammerheads usually give birth to 20-40 live pups, which are about 70cm long as pups.

In Florida, hammerhead sightings have increased in the past two years and it is now not uncommon to see them following fishing boats in an attempt to eat some of their trawls.

Like the shark that gave birth in Florida, hammerhead species generally inhabit shallow reefs in tropical seas worldwide and can even be found in water shallower than one metre.

Most hammerhead species are small and are considered harmless to humans.

Efficient at hunting thanks to their unusual head shape and breadth of vision, they feed on fish, squid, and crustaceans.

They do not actively seek out human prey, but are known to attack when provoked.
