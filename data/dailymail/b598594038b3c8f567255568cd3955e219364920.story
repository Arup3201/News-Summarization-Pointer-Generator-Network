Ten members and associates of the DeCavalcante organized crime family have been arrested in New Jersey, according to federal prosecutors.

They're listed with nicknames like 'Knuckles' and 'Whitey' and they're accused of plotting to commit murder, distribute drugs and promote prostitution around the Newark area.

The suspects include reputed captain 71-year-old Charles Stango, of Henderson, Nevada, and 72-year-old Frank Nigro, of Toms River, a reputed consigliere, or adviser. 

The DeCavalcantes have long been thought to be the real-life inspiration for HBO's The Sopranos (pictured)

Paul Colella, 68, of Toms River was also expected to appear. 

The criminal complaint alleges the DeCavalcante family operates under the direction of New York's Gambino crime family. 

The DeCavalcantes have long been thought to be the real-life inspiration for HBO's The Sopranos.

Prosecutors allege Stango sought and obtained permission from Nigro to kill a family member in New Jersey. 

Authorities said Stango discussed his plans with an undercover agent, telling him that the man had insulted an acting boss of the family and was 'out of control'.

The intended victim 'had to meet death or you gotta maim him or you just gotta put him in a wheelchair for the rest of his life,' Stango allegedly told the agent.

Prosecutor said Stango told the agent that the plan was to hire two members of an outlaw biker gang to shoot the rival, NJ.com reported. 

Prosecutors claim Stango and his son, Anthony, also planned to operate a high-end escort service in the Toms River area.

Some suspects are due in federal court on Thursday afternoon in Newark. Stango is due to appear in a Las Vegas courtroom.
