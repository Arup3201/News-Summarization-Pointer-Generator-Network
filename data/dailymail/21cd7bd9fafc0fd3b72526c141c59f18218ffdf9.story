A network of female beggars on the streets of New York have been exposed as working together using young children to appeal for cash while refusing available city services for shelter and food.

An investigation by NBC New York followed the group of at least nine women for one month, gathering footage that suggests they are not homeless and are even trading off the children among themselves to exploit donations from passers-by.

The women sit separately on the busy streets and subways of Manhattan's bustling Midtown neighborhood, but videos secretly filmed over the course of a few weeks showed them meeting for lunch, shopping, sharing ice cream and talking among themselves.

At night they take the subway together back to the same building in East New York, Brooklyn, NBC News reported.

Scam: An NBC New York investigation has identified a group of women begging on the city's streets who do not appear to be homeless and are refusing services such as food and shelter, but taking cash

Exploitation: The women appear to use their children to appeal for more money from passers-by

Coordinated: The NBC study showed the women live in the same building in Brooklyn but sit on the streets during the day

Appeal: They use their children and signs to ask for money

Lucrative: NBC reports the women could receive numerous handouts in a matter of minutes

One woman said on-camera that she is a Romanian immigrant who lives in an apartment with her mother.

There are various services offered by the city for struggling parents and or homeless people.

George McDonald, who works for a nonprofit called The Doe Fund, which assists homeless people, said not only are the women turning down such services, they are risking the health of their children.

The children would be taken from the women should someone call child services.

'This is a scam - a business,' McDonald told NBC.

'It’s a group of women who who trade off the same children.

Friends: Footage taken from the streets shows that the female beggars know each other

Home: At night the women travel to Brooklyn together and appear to live in the same building

Shopping: The women are seen here checking out items on a street stand together

No comment: One woman refused an interview with NBC investigative reporter Melissa Russo

Lewd: When asked for a comment on what she was doing, one woman flips off the camera crew

Twerking: Another woman slaps her backside for the camera after refusing to comment 

'They work in shifts.

'We have a network of service providers who would help them if they wanted help, which they do not.'

Panhandling is not illegal in New York, unless it takes place in the transit system.

However a New York state law makes it a misdemeanor to use children to beg for money, NBC reported.

The NYPD said they deal with such cases depending on the situation at hand.

Experts: George McDonald, which runs the DOE Fund, says it appears the women are running a scam and have repeatedly refused city services

Social service workers in the area told NBC the women tell have refused shelter and other support when approached in the past.

Karen Freedman, who works with the group Lawyers for Children, said what the women appear to do be doing walks a fine line with the law.

'This is some sort of exploitation at some level,' Freedman said.

'The question is: Is there actual harm to the child?'
