This morning we revealed the sensational news that an animal sanctuary had trained owls to deliver the mail in a development worthy of Harry Potter.

The innovation could revolutionise how our postal system works - but don't get too excited, because now that midday has passed it's time to come clean and admit that it was in fact an April Fool's joke.

While the pictures may have looked convincing, the clue was in the name of the reporter - 'Nesta Vowles' is, sadly, not a real person.

Prank: The Mail reported that owls had been trained to deliver the post just like in Harry Potter

In full flight: But unfortunately these amazing pictures were mocked up - there's no Roy-owl Mail yet!

But the Mail was not the only newspaper to pull the wool over its readers' eyes - many of our rivals also played along with the spirit of the day.

The Guardian roped in its editor Alan Rusbridger to announce the launch of 'Guardian Goggles', a parody of Google glasses which apparently allows its users 'to see the world through the Guardian's eyes at all times'.

The jokey story pokes fun at the left-wing newspaper's reputation for earnest commentary, saying the device is useful 'because life's too short to think for yourself'.

The Daily Express revealed that austerity had even hit the Royal Family, with Buckingham Palace renting out its Belgian Suite to wealthy tourists for £10,000 a night at Hotels.com.

Guests will supposedly be allowed to join the Royals at breakfast 'for an all-you-can-eat buffet selection' - but they will be strictly forbidden from accessing the Palace's wine collection.

A wizard idea: But perhaps the hoax was too close to J.K. Rowling's hit Harry Potter series

Revolutionary: But it might take some time for owls to displace traditional methods of postage

The Daily Telegraph took a political tack, claiming that theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh was about to launch The Coalition: The Musical, by German composer Olaf Dyliparos.

The composer supposedly told the paper: 'It focuses very much on the relationship between David Cameron and Nick Clegg and it has a big, operatic feel to it – I mean, it's a sort of love story that's gone wrong.'

And The Times made a literary joke with its April Fool's gag as it announced the discovery of a cache of papers belonging to Captain Jasper Speedicut, who supposedly fought in all of the British Empire's major battles.

The paper linked the adventurer to Harry Flashman, the fictional hero of George MacDonald Fraser's popular series of novels.

Parody: The Guardian poked fun at its own earnest reputation with 'Guardian Goggles', inspired by Google

The Daily Mirror's prank story will send a chill down the spine of nervous flyers, as it announced the launch of a glass-bottomed plane allowing Virgin Atlantic passengers to watch the world go by during their flight.

The paper reported that planes would be diverted over Loch Ness to survey the spectacular scenery - and provided a clue to the story's purpose by saying that 'more glass floor jets will be introduced from April 1, 2014'.

On its website, the Mirror indulged in a second joke by allowing users to apply 'Instagram-style filters' which change the look of the homepage.

The filters included a vintage MS-DOS look, a mirror image of the Mirror page, and a 'drunk' view to replicate the experience of trying to read the paper after a night out.

Showbiz: The Sun roped in Jodie Marsh to help it trick its readers this April Fool's Day

For its own April Fool's jokes, the Sun turned to the world of showbiz and roped in model Jodie Marsh to play a prank on readers.

The tan addict announced that her brown skin was thanks to 'Tanseal', a new skin product from Ronseal, better known for its DIY wood stains.

Another Sun story reported that the Rolling Stones had gone on a camping holiday (at the 'Rolf Apilo' campsite) in order to prepare for the rigours of headlining Glastonbury this summer.

Online news site The Huffington Post flexed its Photoshop muscles to post a picture of 'The Shlide', a helter-skelter slide newly built around the Shard skyscraper in London.

And venerable leftist magazine the New Statesman joked that it would adopt the hated Comic Sans font to celebrate its 100th anniversary, describing the typeface as 'jaunty, fun and frolicsome'.

Sniffing it out: Google Nose, where users can search the 'Aromabase' for smells and then inhale through their computer and phone screens, was launched on April 1

Google is always an enthusiastic participant in April Fool's Day, and this year posted a number of pranks including Google Nose, supposedly a scent-based search engine.

YouTube, the video site owned by Google, announced that it was shutting down after the conclusion of its eight-year quest to find 'the best video in the world'.

And users of Google Maps were today allowed to apply a 'treasure' filter to their browsing, rendering the world in an antique style.

Twitter also made a major announcement, revealing that it would start charging $5 a month for irs users to be allowed to use vowels.

Comedian Rob Delaney tweeted: '@twitter Y R y00 d0yng thys? #nvwls'.
