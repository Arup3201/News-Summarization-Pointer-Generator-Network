A female employee at a Long Island copier company claims her chunky boss showered her with gifts and raises and then demanded sex in return.

Christina Iannitelli, 24, is suing married father of one Scott Brodsky, 33, president of Empire Digital in Farmingdale, New York for sexual harassment.

She claims she endured a year of Brodsky’s bizarre behavior including sniffing her hair, stripping off his shirt and displaying his ‘flabby’ torso and asking her, ‘Who wouldn’t want to date this?’

Iannitelli, who no longer works for the company, has filed her complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights. In it she claims that when she resisted his amorous advances he threatened to take her perks away.

Her lawyer, Jeffrey Brown, says she was fired last week after Brodsky received her complaint.

‘If he’s trying to get me to have sex with him, he’s saying the most ridiculous things,’ Iannitelli told the New York Post. ‘How does he even think that would work?’

Mailonline spoke to Brodsky, who claims Iannitelli is trying to extort money from the company. ‘It is a shame there are people like this in the world,’ he said.

On the Empire Digital website, Brodsky describes himself as ‘a very unconventional business man to the delight of those who have worked with and for him.’

‘His loyalty and generosity to his staff is unparalleled and his door is always open to discuss any issue with you regardless of your title at the company,’ it reads. ‘He is not known for his stern face and cut throat mentality rather for his out of the box humor and welcoming personality.’

Although Iannitelli has left Empire Digital, she is still listed as controller on the company website. She is described as a ‘self-starting, motivated type’ and ‘a tremendous asset to Empire Digital.’
