'Totally unacceptable': France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, pictured in Luxembourg, summoned the US ambassador to the Elysee Palace to explain himself

American spies secretly listened in to 70.3 million private phone calls in France over less than one month, it emerged today.

The astonishing figure gives an indication of just how easy it is for the US to monitor people’s activities across Europe and has caused outrage in France.

The country's foreign minister has summoned the US ambassador 'immediately' to the Elysee Palace to explain himself and has described America's espionage activities as 'totally unacceptable'.

The scale of spying by America on French individuals and companies was revealed in documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the whistleblower and former contractor at the National Security Agency (NSA).

If repeated every month, more than 843.6 million calls a year would be intercepted in a country with a population of just 65 million.

The report in Le Monde, co-written by Glenn Greenwald who originally revealed the NSA surveillance program, found that when certain numbers were used, the conversations were automatically recorded.

Citing Snowden's leaked documents, Le 
Monde says links to terrorism were not always necessary for an intercept
 to take place, describing.

All of the calls were hacked and taped in the period from December 10 last year to January 8 this year as part of an NSA programme called ‘US-985D’. 

The intercepts appeared under the codes DRTBOX and WHITEBOX, with the NSA intercepting an average 3million-7million calls each day.

Communications involving selected numbers were intercepted, together with text message content.

'This sort of practice between partners that invades privacy is totally unacceptable and we have to make sure, very quickly, that this no longer happens,' French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said during a meeting in Luxembourg with his European counterparts.

The country's Interior Minister Manuel Valls said the figures were ‘shocking’, and insisted that the American government would have to explain itself.

Le Monde has previously reported that 
France stores metadata of ‘all emails, text messages, telephone calls, 
Facebook and Twitter posts’ in an underground bunker in Paris. 

Mr Snowdon is wanted in America on espionage and theft of government property charges after leaking top secret details of the NSA’s monitoring activities to The Guardian.

He has been living in Russia since August 1 when he was granted temporary asylum there for one year and remains wanted by the US authorities.

There was no immediate comment about today’s revelations from the American government. 

Similar programs have been revealed in 
Britain and Germany. In Brazil, the revelations so angered the president
 that she cancelled a state visit to Washington and publicly denounced 
the U.S. for 'violation of human rights and of civil liberties'.

The most recent documents cited by Le Monde, dated to April 2013, also indicated the NSA's interest in email addresses linked to Wanadoo - once part of France Telecom - and Alcatel-Lucent, the French-American telecom company.

One of the documents instructed analysts to draw not only from the electronic surveillance program, but also from another initiative dubbed Upstream, which allowed surveillance on undersea communications cables.

Le Monde’s report comes a day after the German news magazine Der Spiegel said the NSA ‘systematically’ eavesdropped on the Mexican government.

It hacked the public email account of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, which was also used by Cabinet members, according to Der Spiegel, quoting documents released by Mr Snowden.

The former NSA employee said recently he believed he was was acting in the nation's best 
interests by revealing information about the its surveillance dragnet 
and huge collections of communications data.

The latest report on US spying in France underlines the extent of the NSA's capabilities in listening and recording such vast amounts of personal data

He has been blamed for threatening the national security of countries including the UK, by revealing how the US operates to combat terrorist activities.

Snowden has insisted he has not taken any top secret data with him to Russia, where he remains protected until next summer, and that while in China he was able to protect the files from being intercepted by the country's intelligence systems.

In a recent interview with the New York Time, he said intelligence officials in China as well as Russia could not get access to the documents he had obtained before leaving the US.

Mr Snowden said he handed over all the documents he had obtained to journalists during his stay in Hong Kong, prior to flying to Moscow.

He said his familiarity with China's intelligence abilities allowed him to protect the documents from Chinese spies while he was in Hong Kong.

'There's a zero per cent chance the Russians or Chinese have received any documents,' he said.

Mr Snowden's leaks of highly classified material have resulted in numerous news stories about US surveillance activities at home and abroad and sparked debate about their legality, and the privacy implications for average Americans.
