West Ham United fans threw their fury at Sam Allardyce as West Bromwich Albion dealt them out a thrashing in the FA Cup. 

The sold-out away section at The Hawthorns illustrated their relationship with their manager remains febrile, despite an impressive season so far, by chanting 'F*** off Sam Allardyce' as the goals flew in.

West Brom inflicted a 4-0 defeat to dump the Hammers out of the Cup in emphatic fashion, and some 5,500 supporters who travelled from east London were infuriated.

Club captain Kevin Nolan was also booed loudly as he was substituted on the hour mark, continuing his sometimes frosty treatment by West Ham fans.

West Ham out-played Manchester United before succumbing to a late draw two games ago, but here were limp in the extreme. Twice the away fans told Allardyce to 'f**** off' in chant, once after Brown Ideye's second goal and again after Saido Berahino struck. When the later goal was scored in the 70th minute, a stream of West Ham fans made their way for the exits.

Allardyce was also told at one stage, 'You don't know what you're doing'.
