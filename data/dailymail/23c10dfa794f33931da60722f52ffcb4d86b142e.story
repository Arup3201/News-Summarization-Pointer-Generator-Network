Pictured for the first time, this is the housekeeper mistress Rolf Harris moved into his family home as he had an affair right under his wife’s nose.

Harris has admitted that his secret affair with ‘spiritual healer’ Andrea Kingston – known as Andi – devastated his wife Alwen when she eventually found out about it and almost destroyed their marriage.

The TV star boldly moved the pretty brunette – who died at the age of 49 from breast cancer – into the family home in the 1990s. Their affair is thought to have lasted a number of years.

Harris also shamelessly accepted massages from his mistress, who was almost 20 years his junior, in front of his daughter Bindi when she was visiting, it was revealed in his trial.

The mother-of-one, who died in 1999, had separated from her ex-husband Clive Kingston several years earlier.

Retired Mr Kingston said that although he had stayed in contact with his ex-wife, he had no idea of the affair.

Mr Kingston said: ‘Andi was an incredibly giving and supportive person. I knew she was friends with Rolf, but I had no idea they were involved in that way.

‘As far as I was concerned they were just friends, but he was obviously very fond of her as he visited her when she was dying.’ 

Miss Kingston, who adopted a son with learning difficulties, ran into financial problems in the mid-1990s and turned to Harris.

Mr Kingston said: ‘Andi was hopeless with money and she found herself in a bit of difficulty.

‘I know Harris said she could stay in his summer house in exchange for her house-sitting and taking care of his pets. But she didn’t ever mention that they were involved.’

Harris convinced his wife to let Miss Kingston live rent-free at their multi-million-pound riverside home in Bray, Berkshire.

She moved in to the converted boathouse outside the main home which was originally used by Harris’s daughter when she was a teenager and had been dubbed ‘the Bindi House’.

In return for her accommodation, Miss Kingston’s tasks were said to involve housekeeping, looking after the family pets and chauffeuring the entertainer around.

But Harris also relied on her ‘spiritual guidance’ – and more.

When the star’s daughter visited after the birth of her son in 1996, she was disturbed by the chemistry between the couple and confided in a friend – who, unbeknown to her, was one of her father’s victims.

During Harris’ trial, it was revealed that she told the woman: ‘I don’t know why Andi’s here. She’s giving my dad massages.’

She
 told the court: ‘I thought there may have been a sexual relationship 
going on and I was getting a bit fed up with her being around and I 
wanted her to go.’

She said her friend, who had herself been in a relationship with Harris up until a few years earlier, reacted by saying: ‘The bitch, the old cow, she is so ugly, what on earth does he see in her? How dare he? What a s*** he is. Your dad is a right b******.’

It was after this reaction that Bindi asked the friend if her father had ever touched her, and the woman revealed he had abused her for more than 16 years.

Harris admitted in court his affair with Miss Kingston continued until she had to move to a hospice after becoming ill with breast cancer.

Miss Kingston, a former artistic director’s assistant, had initially refused treatment as she believed she could heal herself.

Mr Kingston said: ‘I know he came to visit her in the hospice when she was dying on several occasions, she was on oxygen and in a bad way. He appeared to be quite caring towards her.’
