Actress Anna Kendrick proved her talents as a model when she starred in a stunning set of images for Kate Spade's Christmas campaign.

But the Pitch Perfect star showcases more than just her beautiful looks in a newly-released video advert for the brand, in which she brings to life a feeling of festive fun, while modeling a variety of Kate Spade's glamorous holiday designs. 

The video, which was posted on the brand's YouTube account, sees the 29-year-old returning home to a New York apartment alongside her canine companion Milos, laden with Kate Spade shopping bags, only to discover that she has forgotten her keys and locked herself out.

After discovering that there is nobody inside who can help her, Anna makes a desperate call to a locksmith, in the hopes of quickly remedying her frustrating situation. 

Offering an incredibly lengthy explanation for why she ended up without her keys, she tells the locksmith: 'I think I know exactly where my keys are in my house and I'm usually not so bad about this stuff but I had this key chain and you open it and there's lip gloss inside of it and my niece gave it to me to I felt like I had to wear it for a while. 

'But then I switched back to my... Yeah.'

As she continues to sit and wait, Anna becomes increasingly bored and thinks up with all manner of interesting activities in order to keep herself entertained.

First, she rings a friend to discuss a recent text message she received from a boy, explaining: 'He sends me a fish emoji? Is that a metaphor for something I don't get?' 

Before long, she begins rifling through her stack of shopping bags in the hopes of finding something which might occupy her attention.

Picking out a number of cute Kate Spade designs to model for her pet pooch, including a festive Santa-style bobble hat and a pair of glitzy heels, she decides to snap a few selfies for good measure - all while being watched by a bemused elderly couple who are out walking their dog.

Having well and truly thrown herself into the festive spirit, Anna pops a bottle of bubbly, which she sips through a stripey staw, and begins singing the much-loved Christmas carol Good King Wenceslas.

After what seems like hours spent sitting on her stoop, Anna spots a fire escape ladder just a few feet above her head. 

Putting her new purchases to good use, she ties together a collection of sweaters, scarves and shoes in order to fashion a stylish - but practical rope - which she can use to pull the ladder down to the ground.

Here, the fashionable fiasco finally comes to an end, as Anna clambers up the ladder and opens her front door in order, collecting her adorable dog and taking him inside to get warm. 

The holiday campaign is just the start of what will be a year-long collaboration between Anna and Kate Spade; the brand recently revealed named the Pitch Perfect star as the face of their 2015 'The Year of Adventure' campaign,which will see her working on both film and social media projects with the designer.

'It’s the beginning of a yearlong friendship between us and the clever actress and singer, who’ll be be our storytelling muse throughout 2015, too,' a spokesperson for the brand wrote on their website.

'Stay (digitally) tuned over the course of next year as she inspires us to indulge our passions, be the star of our own lives, and with incandescent charm surprise and delight those around us.'
