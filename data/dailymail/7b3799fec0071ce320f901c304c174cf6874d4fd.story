Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has admitted he would consider managing England in future after previously turning down the advances of the Football Association.

Mourinho was approached to succeed Steve McClaren after leaving Chelsea in September 2007, but rejected the opportunity after consulting his wife Matilde, who believed her husband would miss the day-to-day involvement of club management.

The Portuguese last season spoke of the possibility of one day becoming an international boss.

And although it would not for the foreseeable future, he could envisage managing England.

Asked if he would ever manage England, Mourinho told ITV News London: 'Yes. Not now. Not seven years ago when I had the chance. I made the right decision, my wife helped me make the right decision.

'Not now. No way. Too young, too strong, too much appetite to train every day, to play every game, to play three times a week, too much appetite still.

'But I like your country very, very much. I feel at home. Of course the passport doesn't change, the heart doesn't change.

'I'm Portuguese 100 per cent but I love your country and if one day the opportunity arises, why not?'
