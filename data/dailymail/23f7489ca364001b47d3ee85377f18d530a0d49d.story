What tough times these must be for a son of toil such as Olympic supremo Jacques Rogge.

Picked up in a chauffeur-driven limo from the airport, whisked through  traffic with a motorcycle police escort, then deposited into the luxury of a five-star hotel.

Yesterday was just as hectic for the man who described himself on radio yesterday as ‘a working class person who lives in the real world’.

'I'm working class': At least he is working with class as he presents the Queen with a set of Olympic medals at last night's a reception for members of the International Olympic Committee at Buckingham Palace

A VIP tour of the Olympic village... a
 visit to those nice chaps who made his £10,000 gold watch... tea and 
canapés with the Queen at Buckingham Palace... a night at the opera... 
then back to the Hilton in London’s Park Lane, where a nightcap of fine 
cognac can cost guests £695 if they happen to be settling their own bill
 (which, incidentally, Dr Rogge is not).

Alas, there wasn’t quite time earlier 
in the day to nip down the pub for a pint and a jellied eel supper with 
his other working class muckers from the International Olympic 
Committee, of which he is president – even though he found himself in 
the heart of what remains of the East End.

So it was back to the grindstone for 
the 70-year-old ex-surgeon and former Olympic yachtsman as he made sure 
everything was running smoothly yesterday in the run-up to the opening 
ceremony.

One element of that involved the 
Belgian-born Count spending part of yesterday defending a decision to 
accommodate IOC and other officials in the kind of opulence most 
athletes could never afford.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Rogge said: 'The IOC members work very hard during the Olympic Games.

'This hotel where we are staying is a 
kind of conference room, we have meetings here, so that is very 
important, and IOC members fulfil an important duty within their own 
nation, their own national Olympic committees, awarding medals, sitting 
in various commissions, co-ordination, medical commission and others, so
 we are working class people.

'We live in the real world, absolutely we do.'

Asked why the team could not stay in a
 three-star star hotel, he added: 'I'm sorry but in a three-star hotel 
you will not find the facilities there are in this hotel, conference 
room, simultaneous translation - this is something only more upscale 
hotels have.'

The president of the International Olympic Committee arrived at Heathrow from Lausanne in Switzerland on Friday.

He
 was transported up the M4 into central London in a chauffeur-driven BMW
 using the exclusive Olympic Lane and escorted by five police 
motorcycles.

He
 and around a dozen IOC grandees were ferried to the five-star 453-room 
London Hilton on Park Lane, which has been block-booked by the London 
Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG).

The Hilton has been dubbed ‘Fortress 
Hilton’ because of the heavy security in place, and staff and guests can
 enter only after they have passed through airport-style scanners and 
been frisked by guards.

The Hilton Hotel’s restaurant and 
bars include the famous rooftop bar on the 28th floor, providing 
panoramic views across the capital.

The
 wine list in its 1930s-style Galvin at Windows cocktail bar and 
restaurant includes Louis Roederer Cristal Rose at £1,053 a bottle and 
Hennessy ‘Ellipse’ cognac at £695 a glass.

Mr Rogge, pictured standing under the Olympic rings during a visit to the London 2012 Olympic Village in Stratford today, said he required a chauffeur-driven care throughout the Games to do his job

The VIPs do not have to produce their wallets, because all food and drink is ‘part of the package’.

Yesterday part of his punishing 
schedule involved visiting a shop selling watches by Omega, official 
timekeepers for the Games.

He already sports a rose gold De Ville Co 
Axial, which staff estimated would cost in excess of £10,000.

When asked by a 
Daily Mail reporter why was it important to underline 'working class'  in the context 
of the Olympics he replied:

‘Because people running the IOC work extremely hard,’ he told our reporter Paul Harris.

‘From early hours in the morning to late hours in the evening. It’s very time consuming and a very difficult job.’

When asked if East Enders would 
consider him working class he said that were it not for the security, he
 would invite them to visit the Olympic park.

‘Then they would see how hard people are working,’ he said.

Dr Rogge, who was born in Belgium but
 moved to England at an early age, speaks five languages and is a 
graduate of Ghent university.

He represented Belgium at rugby and competed in yachting at a succession of Olympic events from 1968.

He comes from a top sporting background – his grandfather was a cyclist and his father a track and field athlete and rower.

He is married with two children, and – perhaps unlike fellow blue collar or manual workers – has an impressive art collection.

Head office of the IOC, by the way, is a grand chateau in Lausanne, Switzerland.

Working class then? ‘That wasn’t really what he meant,’ said Mark Adams, IOC director of communications, who sat in on the radio interview.

‘His English is good but he didn’t mean working class as in hammer and sickle. He just meant he works very hard.’

Mr Rogge was welcomed at  Buckingham Palace by Her Majesty and Duke 
of Edinburgh last night.

The Queen officially launches the 
Games on Friday during a spectacular £27million opening ceremony created
 by Hollywood director Danny Boyle.

Mr Rogge insisted last week that the G4S security shambles had not taken the shine off London 2012.

Olympic-sized venue: The heavy security presence surrounding the five-star hotel, where International Olympic Committee members are staying during the Games, has resulted in it being dubbed 'Fortress Hilton'

Speaking about the thousands of troops that have been drafted in to help secure the Games, he said: 'They will not be running around with machine guns and very visible.'

He added: 'They will be ready to intervene and this has been the policy in all Olympic Games since Munich '72 - there has always been security in place but not obtrusive and this will definitely not spoil the fun.'

Around 17,000 athletes and officials will be involved in the 17-day long Games, which amount to 26 world championships.

Mr Rogge this morning also defended strict rules to prevent ambush marketing by firms not signed up as sponsors to the games.

He
 said: 'We have to protect of course the sponsors, it goes without 
saying. You cannot ask a company to pay hundreds of millions of dollars 
and not be protected against ambush marketing.

'But
 the fight against ambush marketing will be led with a lot of common 
sense. Everything that is in good faith will not be affected and will 
not be forbidden.

'If 
you come with a T-shirt and it is not exactly the T-shirt of the sponsor
 in the venue, they will not forbid you from entering the stadium. If it
 is a major attempt to do ambush marketing on a major scale then, yes, 
we will intervene.'
