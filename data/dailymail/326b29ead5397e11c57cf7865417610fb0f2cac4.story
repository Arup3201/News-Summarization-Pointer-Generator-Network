Accused rapist: Married father of four Bryon Johnston has been named the primary suspect in the abduction and sexual assault of two women

AÂ discarded Starbucks cup led police to a married father of four as the primary suspect in the sexual assaults of two women abducted from Olympia, Washington bus stops.

Bryon Johnston, 35, was arrested Tuesday after the cup fell out of the his car and into a parking lot February 19 as a woman he tried to abduct fled, police said.

The cup had a sticker with coffee information that revealed it had been bought earlier that day at a Starbucks drive-through in DuPont. Police were able to match surveillance video, leading them to Johnston, cops said.

Johnston is accused in the November 28 abduction and rape of a woman from a downtown bus stop, and the attempted rape of a woman he kidnapped and sexually assaulted last month, sources told The Olympian.

The woman who escaped her would-be rapist's vehicle gave a chilling account to the paper.

He first picked her up from a bus stop and drove her to a local motor lodge where he asked if she 'wanted to make some money' before groping her breasts and threatening to cut her.

He also pulled her hair as she fought him off while bailing out of the moving vehicle, several items fell out of the truck as he sped off, including the coffee cup.

The woman brought the items to the attention of police who soon arrived on the scene, and the information on the cup's sticker - which includes drink, location and exact time down to the second - made it easy for police to track down Johnston.

The downfall: Police say they identified Johnston after using the information on a cup from the drive-thru window at this Olympia Starbucks

His face was shown on surveillance footage at the Starbucks at exactly the time the sticker said, his vehicle's license plate number was also easily identifiable in the footage, police told the paper.

Police were then able to link this case to last year's attack, which also happened in that same parking lot, sources added. Both women picked him out of a photo lineup, leading to his immediate arrest.

Johnston's defense lawyer, Paul Strophy, declined comment Wednesday.
