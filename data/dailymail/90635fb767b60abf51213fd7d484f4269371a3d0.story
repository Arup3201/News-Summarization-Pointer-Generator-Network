Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes is at the centre of another row after claiming that only those with an ‘expensive education’, like the one he had, are able to understand William Shakespeare plays.

He made the comment in response to criticisms by Shakespeare scholars over the rewriting of dialogue in his recently released screen version of Romeo And Juliet, starring Hailee Steinfeld, Douglas Booth and Damian Lewis.

Caitlin Griffin, from the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington DC - home to the world’s largest collection of Shakespeare materials - was sceptical about Fellowes' approach.

She told The Daily Telegraph: ‘Fellowes’ 
adaptation, while poetic and set in the period of Shakespeare’s play, is
not using Shakespeare’s language. The advertising hasn’t been very 
clear on this fact.’

And Professor Michael Dobson, the director of the University of Birmingham's Shakespeare Institute in Stratford, told the paper: ‘I think it is interesting that there is a trend at the moment to replace some of the bits of difficult vocabulary in Shakespeare to make it clearer, and that is clearly what Fellowes has done with this script - though some of it sounds a little bit clunky in the trailer.’

But Fellowes dismissed the comments, claiming that the language had to be dumbed down, as only those who’ve attended elite universities are capable of engaging with Shakespeare’s works.

He told the BBC: ‘To see the original in its absolutely unchanged form, you require a kind of Shakespearian scholarship and you need to understand the language and analyse it and so on.

‘I can do that because I had a very expensive education, I went to Cambridge. Not everyone did that.’

However, Royal Shakespeare Company actress Janet Suzman told The Guardian that ‘you don’t need to have an education to respond to it’ and that ‘if talented actors understand what they’re doing and can communicate that, then that’s all you need’.

Professor Stanley Wells, author of Shakespeare, Sex, And Love and Honorary President of The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, echoed these thoughts.

He told MailOnline: 'Not all education has to be expensive - I know excellent Shakespearians who went to comprehensive schools.

'Shakespeare's language runs the gamut from passages of considerable intellectual complexity as for instance in some of the speeches of Troilus and Cressida to others of sublime simplicity, such as the reunion of Lear and Cordelia.

'One of the advantages of seeing and hearing Shakespeare well acted is that the actors have done some of the work of comprehension for you, so that the listener may understand the feeling behind the lines without necessarily being able to paraphrase them.

'But nothing will come of nothing (as Lear says.) It's not unreasonable to hope that people - young or old - should make an effort to educate themselves into a state where they can understand and enjoy some of the greatest works ever written.'

Penelope Middleboe, CEO of Shakespeare Schools Festival, which is giving 25,000 students across the UK the chance to perform Shakespeare in their local theatre, also disagreed with Fellowes' assertion, arguing that children from all walks of life are able to enjoy his plays.

She said: 'When children are given the opportunity to frame Shakespeare in their own terms, the magic begins. We call it CSI Shakespeare – to challenge, support and inspire every child through performing Shakespeare’s work. Any child, whatever their background, and regardless of any learning, physical or cultural challenge they may be facing, can grasp the Bard’s great words and make them their own.'

Mr Fellowes’ remarks follow controversy over a rape scene in Downton Abbey that attracted more than 200 complaints.

He defended the scene, saying the director had shown restraint in cutting away to other rooms of the house and it could have been much more graphic.

He told the BBC: 'The whole point of the way we do things on Downton is we don't do them gratuitously. We are interested in exploring the resultant emotions and the effect these things have on people.’
