People who are drunk and anxious are most likely to be emotionally connected to Facebook, according to new research.

A doctoral student has also discovered that people who use marijuana are less likely to be emotionally connected to the social networking site.

Russell Clayton, from the University of Missouri School of Journalism, wanted to discover how involved Facebook’s one billion users become in the site.

Heavy drinkers and people who are very anxious are most likely to be emotionally connected to Facebook.

People who use marijuana are less likely to be hooked.

People who are lonely or anxious are more likely to use Facebook to connect with others.

He surveyed more than 225 students about their perceived levels of loneliness, anxiousness, alcohol use and marijuana use.

He found that students who reported higher levels of anxiousness and alcohol use were more emotionally connected to Facebook and to the social connections it facilitates.

Mr Clayton also discovered that students who had higher levels of anxiety and loneliness were more likely to use Facebook as a platform to connect with others.

‘People who perceive themselves to be anxious are more likely to want to meet and connect with people online, as opposed to a more social, public setting,’ Mr Clayton said.

‘Also, when people who are emotionally connected to Facebook view pictures and statuses of their Facebook friends using alcohol, they are more motivated to engage in similar online behaviours in order to fit in socially.’

He added that because alcohol use is generally viewed as normative, or socially acceptable, among college students, increased alcohol use may cause an increase in emotional connectedness to Facebook.

By contrast, he also found that students who used marijuana were less emotionally connected with Facebook.

‘Marijuana use is less normative, meaning fewer people post on Facebook about using it,’ Mr Clayton said. ‘In turn, people who engage in marijuana use are less likely to be emotionally attached to Facebook.’

Clayton and his fellow researchers also found that students who reported high levels of perceived loneliness were not emotionally connected to Facebook, but use Facebook as a tool to connect with others.

This study was published in the Journal of Computers in Human Behaviour.
