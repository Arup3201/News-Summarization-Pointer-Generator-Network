One third of staff said they had witnessed medical blunders and one quarter have been bullied

Nearly 40 per cent of doctors would not recommend their own hospital to friends or family, startling new figures reveal.

A further one in three do not believe NHS managers act on the concerns of patients.

The Department of Health’s own survey also found that a third of NHS staff had witnessed medical blunders or near misses at least once in the last month.

The North Cumbria University Hospitals 
Trust, which runs Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle and the West 
Cumberland Hospital in Whitehaven, was the worst ranked of all the 
trusts surveyed.

Just 35 per cent of staff would recommend treatment to 
their friends of family.

The trust is among several being investigated for high death rates by Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of the NHS.

Croydon Health Services, Mid Yorkshire Hospitals and Weston Area Health were also among the poor performers.

And
 Mid Staffordshire NHS trust, which was yesterday facing administration 
by regulators, also continues to perform poorly, according to the 
survey.

Only 59 per cent of staff said they would recommend treatment to family and friends.

The poll also revealed that nearly a quarter of workers had been harassed or bullied by other colleagues over the past 12 months.

Just over 101,000 doctors, nurses, paramedics, and administrative staff took part in the annual survey.

Ministers said the overall findings were broadly similar to this time last year although insisted there were some improvements.

They also revealed that 17 per cent of staff did not think patient care was their manager’s top priority.

A total of 38 per cent said they had suffered work-relayed stress in the last 12 months while 15 per cent had been bullied by patients or  the relatives of patients.

Mid Staffordshire NHS trust, which is facing administration, continued to perform poorly in the survey

Staff at North Cumbria University 
Hospitals and United Lincolnshire Hospitals are the least likely to 
recommend their own hospitals to friends of family, according to the 
figures.

Less than 40 per cent of those who 
work at the two trusts, both of which have relatively high death rates, 
would recommend the treatment available, compared with more than 90 per 
cent of staff at the top-rated hospitals.

Health minister Dr Daniel Poulter said survey showed staff motivation and job satisfaction were improving

In the survey, 203,000 NHS staff were asked to respond to the 
statement: ‘If a friend or relative needed treatment, I would be happy 
with the standard of care provided by this organisation.’

They had to say whether they strongly agreed, strongly disagreed, agreed, disagreed or had no view.

More
 than 101,000 staff responded.  Nationally, 63 per cent said they 
strongly agreed or agreed with the statement, 12 per cent said they 
disagreed or disagreed strongly, 25 per cent did not ‘express a 
preference’.

That left 37 per cent of staff who did not recommend treatment.

At 17 health service trusts, fewer than half of staff would recommend treatment to friends and families.

In January David Cameron announced that from next month every hospital and doctors’ surgery in England will face a ‘friends and family test’ to see if patients would recommend them to loved ones.

The Prime Minister said the  surveys would act as an early  warning ‘flashing light’ to  highlight where parts of the NHS are failing.

Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said: ‘NHS
 staff have some of the hardest and most respected jobs in our country. 
It is good to see that staff motivation, job satisfaction and engagement
 are all up on 2011, demonstrating the commitment of NHS staff to 
providing the best possible care for patients.’
