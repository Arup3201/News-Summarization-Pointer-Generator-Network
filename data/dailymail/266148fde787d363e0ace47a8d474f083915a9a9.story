He ruled the prestigious Sydney school Knox Grammar with an iron fist and students nicknamed him The Snake because of it.

But a former Knox pupil told Daily Mail Australia one-time headmaster Dr Ian Paterson lived up to that reputation by 'slithering away'  while providing evidence at the Royal Commission into Child Sex Abuse on Tuesday.

Dr Paterson, the school's headmaster from 1969 to 1998, began the proceedings by reading out a statement apologising to students for what had occurred, accepting responsibility for 'all that occurs during my headmastership'.

Further remarks provoked a loud groan from former students, relatives and support personnel watching on when he described an alleged sexual assault victim as a 'drama boy who liked to exaggerate stories' .

The 15-year-old victim, known as ASD, had approached Dr Paterson in 1987 to report that teacher and resident housemaster Damien Vance had touched his bottom and made an 'inappropriate sexual suggestion' under the school chapel, the commission heard. 

'I'm not aware it was a crime,' the former headmaster told the commission, as he confirmed he had asked the boy to sit in the library while he attempted to investigate the story by questioning Mr Vance. Dr Paterson did not contact the police.

'In light of today, (it is) an extremely serious matter.'

On several occasions, a frustrated Dr Paterson, 81, said he did not recall specific details - including what concerns he had about teacher Roger James' relationship with young men. The commission's inquiry into Knox Grammar continues.

At Knox years ago, Dr Pateron was an all-powerful figure, according to former students.   

'He was the power in the land,' Knox old boy and author Peter FitzSimons told Daily Mail Australia outside the hearing today. 'He was the Parliament and the King.'

But Mr FitzSimons said that while Dr Paterson appeared to be 'running a tight ship' to his unaware students, many were unaware of the 'carnage below the decks'.

He ruled the prestigious Sydney school Knox Grammar with an iron fist and students nicknamed him The Snake because of it.

But in the words of a former Knox pupil, one-time headmaster Dr Ian Paterson lived up to that reputation by 'slithering away' from tough questions while providing evidence.

The American-educated Dr Paterson's testimony drew considerable interest from former students, after allegations his school had a 'cover-up culture'.

Former senior prefect at the school and radio broadcaster Gus Worland told Daily Mail Australia last week: 'We all respected Dr P so much and were scared of him,' said Worland. 

A former Knox Grammar student onlooker, who attended between 1987 and 1991, was unimpressed by his former headmaster's testimony, which lasted for most of six hours today.

‘I just have to say, his nickname at school was The Snake,' said the student, who did not wish to be named for fear of offending a friend and a relative. 'That’s true then and that’s true today. '

'He’s slithering his way out of this mess his teachers’ made and he’s covered it up.' 

Dr Paterson ran the school with an iron fist. 'He was the power in the land,' former student Peter FitzSimons said
