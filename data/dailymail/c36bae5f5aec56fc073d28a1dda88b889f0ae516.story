Vince Cable yesterday attacked the Tories¿ proposed tax breaks for married couples

Vince Cable yesterday attacked the Tories’ proposed tax breaks for married couples as an ‘insult’.

The Business Secretary said the long-promised move by the Conservatives would unfairly penalise widows and those whose spouses had left them.

The assault by the senior Lib Dem came after it emerged that party leader Nick Clegg has agreed a deal with David Cameron to ensure it becomes law.

Sources say the Deputy Prime Minister will order his MPs to abstain on any vote on the issue and is threatening to sack any ministers who break ranks.

It is thought that Mr Clegg has agreed not to oppose the measure in return for a £600million commitment to extend free school meals to children aged between five and seven.

But Mr Cable yesterday denounced the proposed flagship Conservative policy, under which one spouse would be allowed to transfer £750 of their tax-free personal allowance to their partner.

‘I’m a great believer in marriage, and I’m in favour of encouraging stable marriage,’ he said. ‘But this is not the way to do it.

‘It’s going to create massive unfairness. Widows will be penalised. People who have been abandoned by their partners will be penalised.

‘People in good, stable marriages are going to be insulted at the idea that a few hundred quid a year is going to keep their marriage together.’

The measure would particularly favour those partnerships where someone stays at home and will also be extended to gay couples in civil partnerships or – once the law changes next year – marriages.

Labour has already said it will oppose the recognition of marriage in the tax system, opening up a key election dividing line.

The proposed policy can now only pass into law if the Lib Dems stick to a previous agreement to abstain in any future Commons vote on the issue.

Mr Clegg will today tell the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow that the party had committed not to vote against the measure as part of a Coalition deal.

‘The Conservatives are very attached to the idea of a so-called married tax break, and they put it in the coalition agreement and we committed not to vote against it,’ he will say.

‘But I don’t support it because I don’t understand what is remotely fair about telling an unmarried taxpayer, “You are going to have to pay higher taxes to help your neighbour just because they got married to get lower taxes”.

The Conservatives want to single out certain families, we want to help all families with young children.’ 

A source close to the Deputy Prime Minister insisted that all Lib Dem MPs would be expected to abstain on the issue.

‘They want to spend whatever it is on the marriage tax allowance, we want to spend it on free school meals for all young children,’ the source said.

‘It’s a straight up and down deal. We will be sticking to the coalition agreement and abstaining when marriage tax comes forward and we will expect our MPs to do that.’ 

Ministers or MPs who refuse to comply and vote against the measure can expect to be dismissed, the source indicated.

Mr Cable is planning to abstain, but his attack on the idea of a transferable tax allowance may encourage other potential rebels.

The measure has been brought forward on the agenda and Chancellor George Osborne now plans to include it in his Autumn statement.

He has also promised childcare tax breaks after 2015 to help working women, leading to calls to support for stay-at-home mothers with a transferable tax allowance.

The Coalition’s previous focus was to raise the personal income tax allowance threshold to £10,000. 

But a report unveiled at the Lib Dem conference by Christian charity CARE last night called it a ‘terribly inefficient’ way of helping poorer families as it ‘ignores Britain’s lack of regard for family responsibility’.

It called for a generous transferable allowance for married couples.
