Pepe Reina has not ruled out the possibility of remaining at Napoli next season but says it depends on Liverpool agreeing to the deal.

The 32-cap Spain international spent the entirety of the last campaign on loan In Naples but is not sure where he will be plying his trade at the start of next season.

Although Napoli manager Rafael Benitez - who signed Reina for Liverpool in 2005 - is keen on keeping the stopper, the club are reportedly unwilling to meet the asking price for Reina

Success: Reina made 30 league appearances for Napoli, as well as playing in the Champions League

The 31-year-old, who is currently training with Spain ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, has two years left on his contract at Anfield and so Liverpool will hope to recoup a decent fee.

'There is the possibility to stay at Napoli,' Reina told Gazzetta dello Sport.

'It will depend on Liverpool, Napoli and on Reina.

'I have been really happy at Napoli and I feel loved.

'There is a project at Napoli that makes one dream.

'I have never ruled out the possibility to remain at Napoli.'

The Spaniard impressed for Napoli last season, making 30 league appearances and helping Benitez's men qualify for the Champions League with a third-place finish in Serie A.

And Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers indicated earlier this year that he does not see a future for Reina on Merseyside.
