Their riotous show has just won one of the most prestigious awards  in radio.

But, as may be apparent from their names, Beryl and Betty are not the latest young turks of the airwaves.  

They are - at 86 and 90 respectively - probably the oldest women on radio.

Winners: David Reeve of BBC Radio Humberside celebrates his award with 'co hosts' Betty and Beryl

Nevertheless, they have seen off established stars and much younger rivals to win the award for best entertainment programme at the Sony Radio Academy Awards, the Oscars of the UK industry.

The BBC Radio Humberside hosts beat names including Frank Skinner and the BBC’s Adam & Joe for their hour-long Saturday evening show which airs at 6pm.

The pair banter with co-host David Reeves about matters such as fashion and sex, cackle to seaside postcard humour, and play easy-listening music.

Mr Reeves, who also produces the show, met the two pensioners during a guided tour of the BBC Hull building in 2006.

They now join him every week to offer their ‘knowledge of local history, new music and taste in younger men’.

The Sony radio award judges said: ‘A 
joyous, entertaining  double act, having fun with the medium and 
unconstrained by any ingrained ideas of what works and what doesn’t.

‘They
 give a voice to a sector of society unrepresented on radio, and do it 
with a joy that puts many of their fellow broadcasters to shame.’

The
 double act, which has been on air for six years, picked up their award 
watched by some of the industry’s biggest names, including Radio 2 star 
Chris Evans.

The ceremony also featured performances from Jessie J and Gary Barlow.

Previous winners of the same award have included Evans, Russell Brand and Chris Moyles.

However, the ladies’ show only pulls in between 10,000 and 20,000 regular listeners each week, directly after their station’s football coverage ends.

Last night Beryl Renwick, 86, said: ‘It’s never been known to have older people like us getting their big break in broadcasting. It’s quite a thing at our age.

‘It all started six years ago. We used to run a Saturday night club for ladies, and we asked the BBC to take us round the studios.

'David heard us talking and interviewed us for a job on his show, and it all went on from there.’

Asked for the secret of the show’s success, Betty Smith, 90, said: ‘We never stop talking.

‘And because we have lived full lives, people want to hear what we have to say. We are full of good advice.’

Mrs Renwick added: ‘We are never scared to give a straight answer. If a caller has a dilemma, we do our best to help. And we don’t get embarrassed, no matter what the subject matter is.’

Mr Reeves has said: ‘I was interested in older people’s views. Nothing heavy, just their stories, their thoughts on the week.’

He said he had visited old  people’s homes to find the right people but had drawn a blank.

Andy Gray, left, and Richard Keys, right – sacked from Sky TV in a sexism row two years ago – won the best sports programme award, pictured right, for their TalkSport show.

The sexism scandal in January 2011, which brought an abrupt end to their 20-year stint with Sky began when the two were recorded speaking off-air about female assistant referee Sian Massey prior to a game between Liverpool and Wolves.

Gray was sacked from his £1.7m a year job at Sky after more tapes emerged of him making sexist comments.

He asked co-presenter Charlotte Jackson to tuck a microphone into his trousers in a 12-second video posted on YouTube by an anonymous user.

Presenter Richard Keys resigned from his £500,000 a year job after a tape was posted of him using crude language in a studio at Chelsea’s Stamford Bridge ground.

He referred to a woman as 'it' and twice asked pundit Jamie Redknapp if he 'smashed it'. Redknapp replied that he 'used to go out with her'.

But judges at the annual awards said their new morning show on TalkSport was a 'must-listen for serious sports fans'.

Gray is no stranger to radio having 
previously worked as a match summariser for Talk Radio at the World Cup 
in France in 1998, and for Five Live at the Japan/South Korea World Cup 
in 2002.
