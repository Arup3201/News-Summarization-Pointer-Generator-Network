Whenever Rebecca Brown was stressed or upset when she was growing up she would play with her hair for comfort.

By the time she was 16 her habit had escalated into a full-blown psychological disorder - which left her almost completely bald.

Doctors failed to diagnose the condition for five years, simply telling her to stop being a fidget. Meanwhile at school she endured cruel taunts and nasty looks from her classmates.

Spelling it out: She wrote the name of her condition on her head to explain it to her online followers

Rebecca Brown started pulling her hair out at the age of 12 and by the time she was 16 she was nearly bald. When she was 19 the condition got so bad she was forced to shave her head completely (pictured)

Feeling lost and alone, she started 
taking a photograph of herself every day, chronicling her experiences on
 the internet in a blog and in YouTube videos with brutal honesty.

To her utter surprise the response was overwhelming – and to her delight it was supportive.

As a result, her self-confidence has grown back – and so has her hair.

Miss
 Brown, now 20, has become a heroine to thousands of other sufferers of 
trichotillomania, a disorder characterised by the uncontrollable urge to
 pluck out the hair, usually from the scalp but also sometimes eyebrows 
and eyelashes.

Ms Brown took photos of herself every day for five years and posted a slide show of the pictures on YouTube. She is pictured in February 2012 when the condition was particularly bad

Ms Brown (pictured before she started pulling out her hair) said: 'Some people say trichotillomania is a result of childhood trauma but for me, pulling my hair has been a comfort thing. I do it a lot when I am stressed or upset'

Her videos 
have been viewed 12million times and she receives so much  fan mail 
online it takes her three hours a week to reply to it all. She was even 
mobbed by fans when she attended a conference on the condition in the 
US  this year.

Miss Brown 
said: ‘I get a lot of post from people who confide in me about their 
trichotillomania, yet they haven’t told their family or friends. I feel 
very blessed that people trust me like that.’

Miss
 Brown played with hair obsessively as a child and began pulling out 
clumps when she was a teenager. She said: ‘I started going to the doctor
 about it when I was 13 but they didn’t diagnose it until 18. Before I 
was diagnosed, doctors advised me to do all sorts of silly things. One 
doctor told me to stop fidgeting and another told me to sit on my hands.

Ms Brown (pictured in 2012 after shaving her head) said she decided to make the videos about her condition when she realised how little information there was about it on the internet

As a result of her YouTube videos, Ms Brown (pictured in February 2012) had a large group of supporters who also have trichotillomania

‘Some
 people say trichotillomania is a result of childhood trauma but for me,
 pulling my hair has been a comfort thing. I do it a lot when I am 
stressed or upset.

‘A lot 
of people at school and college didn’t understand why I was going bald. 
Lots of people mockingly called me “baldie”. But it was the horrible 
looks that I got from other kids that was the worst thing.’ At one point
 she had so little hair she shaved her head to make herself feel better;
 at other times she wore wigs.

She said: 'I get a lot of post from people who confide in me about their trichotillomania yet they haven't told their family or friends about it. I feel very blessed that people trust me like that'

She said: 'It has given me a voice. I have found it hard to speak to counsellors about my problem but it has always felt easy to talk to a webcam'

By
 the time she was 14 she decided to find out for herself what was 
happening to her. She did an internet search for ‘hair pulling’ and 
discovered what trichotillomania was.

Miss
 Brown, from Chelmsford, Essex, said: ‘All that came up in the search 
results were three not-so-brilliant videos on the disorder.

‘I
 decided to upload my own, no-holds-barred video.’  In some photos, she 
wrote the name of her disorder on her forehead in marker pen with an 
arrow pointing to her last remaining bristles as she attempted to 
explain the condition to the outside world.

Miss
 Brown, who is in her final year at film school in London, believes that
 posting the videos on the internet has aided her recovery. ‘I have 
found it hard to speak to councillors but it has always felt easy to 
talk to a webcam,’ she said.

A
 spokesman for Trichotillomania Support said: ‘It is important that 
sufferers know they are not alone and they should not be ashamed of 
asking for support.’
