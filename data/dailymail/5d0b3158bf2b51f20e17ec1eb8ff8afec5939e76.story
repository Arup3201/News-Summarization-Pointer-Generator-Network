Hospital food is to be given an overhaul following concerns that a third of vulnerable patients are not being given enough help at meal times.

Many are too frail even to open cling-film or cardboard packaging and are left struggling as nursing staff move on to the next bed.

Without the necessary assistance, they risk malnutrition and dehydration, say charities. Ministers are also concerned at the high cost of waste as 30million uneaten meals are thrown away annually.

It is feared many dishes consist of recipes that elderly patients would not normally eat, like Thai curry.

The Government and Age UK have now vowed to carry out a major review of hospital food, with national standards issued by next summer.

Relatives have told how previously sprightly patients have become emaciated and lifeless on wards because they are either too frail to eat or just cannot face the meals.

Those with dementia, arthritis or poor sight are often left grappling with tricky wrapping and difficult to open sandwich packets or simply struggling to hold paper cups.

Dianne Jeffrey, chairman of Age UK said: ‘There are a lot of older and vulnerable people who are malnourished or at risk of malnourishment.

‘To find yourself in hospital without control over what and when you eat and drink can be very distressing.

'Good nutrition and hydration are critical elements of hospital care and should be considered as important as medical treatment.

'Malnutrition and dehydration can be a real risk for patients if they go unnoticed and untreated. They can’t just be left as no one’s responsibility. Often the food doesn’t actually get into people’s stomach.’

The charity and the Government is hoping to recruit a panel of experts, including nurses, carers and those working in the food industry, to draw up national guidelines.

Protocols will include ways of ensuring there are enough staff to help the frailest patients with meals, as well as basic standards for food quality.

A report by the Care Quality Commission this summer found that 36 per cent of vulnerable patients were not given vital help with meals.

And a separate review of hospital food by the charity Sustain found that 30 million meals are thrown away every year.

There were also concerns that offerings are too modern for the elderly, containing items like mung beans or Oriental flavours.

Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said: ‘There is still too much variation in food provision across the NHS and we want to see all hospitals following the same good practice standards that many are already achieving.

'In future, hospitals will be judged on the quality of their food by patients through patient-led assessments.’
