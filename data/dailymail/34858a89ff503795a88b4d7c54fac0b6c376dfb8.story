A young man who stabbed his step-grandmother to death in a ‘sexually motivated’ attack after watching hard-core  pornography online was facing life in jail last night.

Retired nurse Janis Dundas, 62, was murdered by homeless Jack Huxley, then 20, just hours after she gave him a place to stay.

In the middle of the night, Huxley, who was high on drugs and vodka, logged onto her laptop and spent three hours viewing explicit pornography, showing sexual activity between young men and mature women.

Huxley, whom Mrs Dundas treated as a blood relative, cut her throat and stabbed her up to 30 times as she slept in bed.

It was unclear whether Huxley, who had
never had a girlfriend, sexually assaulted his victim before or after 
she died, but she was discovered almost naked and forensic evidence 
indicated the killing was sexually motivated.

Yesterday Huxley, 21, was warned he faces life in jail after pleading guilty to murder at Liverpool Crown Court.

The case comes a day after Culture 
Secretary Maria Miller warned about the ‘pernicious effect’ of online 
porn, which risks creating a generation of boys who grow up with a 
warped idea of how to treat women and girls. She called on teachers, 
parents and internet giants to do more to stop children from 
accidentally viewing such images, which are giving young people 
‘unrealistic expectations’ of sex.

Stuart Lawson Rogers QC, prosecuting, 
told the court that the attack happened in the early hours of April 5, 
hours after Mrs Dundas ‘out of the goodness of her heart’ agreed for 
Huxley to sleep on the living-room floor of her one-bedroom flat, in 
Ellesmere Port, Cheshire.

Huxley,  the son of Mrs Dundas’s 
daughter’s partner, had been ‘wandering the streets’ after moving out of
his grandparents’ home a few weeks earlier because they were unable to 
cope with his mood swings and drug and alcohol problems.

Immediately after the attack, Huxley, 
who had been drinking vodka, smoking cannabis and had taken the party 
drug mephedrone during the day, took an overdose of prescription pills, 
before fleeing in Mrs Dundas’s car.

But he immediately crashed the 
vehicle, hitting a wall and another car, and neighbours called the 
police. Huxley was arrested and taken to hospital.

Mrs Dundas was discovered by police 
face down on her bedroom floor with three knives protruding from her 
back. A post-mortem investigation revealed she died of severe neck 
injuries.

The retired nurse also had ‘horrific’ 
hand injuries and her right index finger had been almost severed where 
she had attempted to defend herself.

Charles Miskin, QC, defending, said 
Huxley, who has no previous convictions, had acted out a ‘sudden and 
galvanic explosion of violence, catalysed by some sexual component’. But
he said the youth was ‘very immature’ and had endured a ‘terrible and 
troubled childhood’.

Mr Miskin said Huxley was clinically depressed and had suffered ‘developmental problems’ all his life.

Huxley, of no fixed abode, held his head in his hands throughout the hearing. He is due to be sentenced today.

The Daily Mail has been campaigning 
for an automatic block on online porn, with over-18s able to access 
material only after a strict age verification check.
