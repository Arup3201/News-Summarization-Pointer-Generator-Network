Westlake police say the stolen pickup was traveling 75 mph in a 35 mph zone before it crashed into the tavern Thursday night.

The entire pursuit was captured on police dash cam.

The truck ran over stop sticks police placed in the road and then lost control.

Police say 12 people sustained injuries, from bumps and bruises to broken bones. 

Tom Sutton, a patron of Dover Gardens Tavern who witnessed the collision take place, said he was shocked to see a vehicle smash through the wall.

'I didn't even move at all for a second because I was just like "did a truck just come through this bar?"' he told NBC News.

Twenty-six-year-olds Brandon Pawlak and Matthew Snowden have been charged in connection with the theft and crash. 

They are scheduled to appear in court Tuesday.
