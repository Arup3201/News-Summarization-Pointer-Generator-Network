Of the many dramatic storylines featured in Downton Abbey to keep Sunday night viewers hooked - the most prevalent has always been what will happen to the house and whether it will stay in the family.

So perhaps it is somewhat fitting that the owner of Highclere Castle, the setting for the period drama, fears the estate could be broken up and sold - because of changing inheritance laws.

In an interview with The Lady magazine, the 8th Earl of Carnarvon said changes in the law of royal succession, which now allow first-born daughters to accede to the throne ahead of their younger brothers, could put estates across the country in jeopardy.

Fears: The Earl of Carnarvon fears his estate - the setting for Downton Abbey - is in danger of being sold because of changing inheritance laws

He said the change, which has prompted some to argue for an abolition of male primogeniture when it comes to aristocratic titles and estates, was a step towards the French Napoleonic Code - which decreed property should be split equally among offspring.

The idea has never gained traction in this country, but some in certain circles fear it may only be a matter of time before it becomes law.

The Earl of Carnarvon said: 'There's obviously a reason for these things, which was to keep the place intact with the same name attached to it.

'If you go further down that road, you are going to be heading towards the Napoleonic Code, which would break up all the great British places and that would be the end of them. It would mean selling them all, which probably wouldn't be the best idea.'

The concern echoes one of season one's main plotlines - when the title and inheritance of Downton when to distance cousin Matthew Crawley.

The Carnarvon family have come close 
to losing their 50-bedroom, 6,000 acre estate before over the past 100 years – as Lady 
Carnarvon reveals in her new biography, Lady Catherine And The Real 
Downton Abbey.

She said: 'After doing my research, I am amazed we are still here.

'The title dies or slips to a cousin then that's it - there's no point worrying about it.'

Storyline: Inheritance was a main plot in the first series of the drama - the fourth series of which is due to return to our screens this weekend

Other families have been stung in the past by such laws - including the daughters of David Carnegie, the 14th Earl of Northesk, who failed to prevent the title from passing to someone he had never met.

Patrick Carnegy, 72, claimed the title based on Carnegy's descent from a junior line of the family that split off in 1654.

The latter case has been used by pressure groups who are trying to seek gender equality in line with changes to the royal succession.

The Countess of Clancarty, a member of one group of more 100 noble families, told The Times: 'The Northesk case shows quite clearly how ridiculous, unfair and iniquitous the current system of inheritance is.

The Countess did however accept that things had moved on from the world portrayed in Downton Abbey.

She added: 'In today's world these houses are not personal assets anyway. This is not our personal asset.

'It is our personal passion and our home for the time being, but it's a shared treasure.

'We can only pass it on in as good a nick as possible ad then it is up to the next generation.'
