He is now halfway through his six week long aerial odyssey, having landed in Darwin - in Australia's Northern Territory - this week in his 1981 Beechcraft A36 Bonanza.

'Can't say flying alone over the Australian outback is quite how I usually spend the Fourth of July,' he wrote on his Facebook page on Friday.

Matt will be making 25 stops in 14 different countries across five continents during his journey. These include London in the UK, Rome in Italy, Athens in Greece, Cairo in Egypt and Bangkok in Thailand.

His next stop is Brisbane then Noumea, New Caledonia.

'Nothing is impossible,' he wrote on the website.

'And Iâ€™ve never been the kind of person to just hang around and wait for great things to happen. If you really want to achieve something great you have to go out and get it.'

'Records are made to be broken,' Matt said.

'My real goal is to inspire other young people to attempt things of a similar magnitude. That's what I hope to accomplish with this flight.'

Matt documents his adventure through Limitless Horizons, a non-profit fundraiser.

'The goal is to raise $250,000. Cost of the trip is about $145,000. So I am looking at (donating) about $105,000 to Code.org,' he said.

Code.org, is a non-profit organisation that pushes for computer science and programming to be taught in schools.
