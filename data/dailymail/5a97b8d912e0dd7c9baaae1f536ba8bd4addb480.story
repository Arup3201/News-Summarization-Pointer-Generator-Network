Relative to millions: Mongol warlord Genghis Khan

Hundreds of millions of people are descended to tyrants and despots, according to a study.

Laura Betzig, an evolutionary anthropologist from Michigan, has discovered that rulers such as Genghis Khan, Rameses the Great and Yangdi, the 6th-century Sui dynasty emperor systematically impregnated women, the latter fathering around 100,000 babies.

It means that there are millions of people alive today with genetic traits associated with seeking power and oppressing people.

Betzig explains that mass impregnations began around eight to nine thousand years ago when emperors and elites took over from hunter-gatherers.

Betzig told The Sunday Times: ‘In evolutionary terms this period of human existence created an enormous selective pressure, with the guys at the top who had the least desirable traits passing on their genes to huge numbers of offspring.’

Her research covered the rulers of the first six great civilisations - Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, China, Mexico and Peru – but it was in China that mass impregnations was carried out the most systematically.

Numbers game: Rameses the Great is thought to have fathered around 200 children

Yangdi: The Chinese emperor is credited with impregnating a staggering 100,000 women

One historian believes that Yangdi, the 6th-century Sui dynasty emperor, for example, had children with 100,000 women.

For more than 2,000 years the system in China, said Betzig, was that women would be taken to the emperor to be impregnated when they were most fertile – and they had to be under 30 and attractive and symmetrical.

The 13-century Mongol warlord Genghis Khan, meanwhile, is thought to have 16m male descendants, thanks to his habit of sleeping with scores of women.

And Rameses the Great, who ruled Egypt 3,200 years ago, fathered 200 children.

Some British lords also passed on their genes in a similar manner, with some having sex with hundreds of serfs, according to Betzig.

Her research is published in the latest edition of Evolution & Human Behavior.
