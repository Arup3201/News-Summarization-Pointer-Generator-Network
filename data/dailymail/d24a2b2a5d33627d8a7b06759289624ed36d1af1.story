German leader Angela Merkel has returned from a Christmas and New Year break with a broken pelvis that she didn't know about.

The chancellor was on a skiing trip in Engadin in Switzerland when she fell.  

She thought she suffered only bruises but a medical examination when she returned to the German capital Berlin showed she had actually broken a bone.

Mishap: Chancellor Merkel, pictured while skiiing at the resort in the Engadine valley of Switzerland on December 22, broke her hip during a fall

Doctors told her she will have to rest for the next three weeks while the injury heals.

Government spokesman Steffen Seibert said said: 'She suffered serious bruising in connection with a partial fracture on her left posterior pelvic ring. 

'We understand she was going at slow speed on a cross-country ski course when the accident occurred.'

Although she can walk unaided she has been instructed she cannot travel by plane and must lie down as much as possible for the next three weeks.

She will have to cancel a planned visit to Poland and a meeting with the Luxembourg Prime Minister in Berlin. 

Out of action: Angela Merkel, pictured during 
her skiing trip to St Moritz on December 22, fell at 'low speed' 
according to her spokesman who said will spend the next few weeks 
recovering

On holiday: The 59-year-old politician, pictured during her trip to St Moritz before Christmas accompanied by two bodyguards, suffered a pelvis injury during a fall

But she will be able to attend the first cabinet meeting of the new coalition government she leads on Wednesday.

'It goes without saying that as chancellor, she is capable of acting as well as communicating fully,' added Seibert.

Mrs Merkel had already suffered her injury by the time Michael Schumacher endured his catastrophic accident in France.

The
 seven times Formula One world champion remains in an induced coma in 
hospital in Grenoble, France, where he has undergone two operations to 
remove blood clots and relieve pressure on his brain.

Critical: Seven-time Formula One champion Michael Schumacher suffered a serious head injury while skiing in the French Alps resort of Meribel

Schumacher's family have given 
investigators the mini Go-Pro camera which was attached to his ski 
helmet and may contain crucial footage of the moment he lost control and
 hit his head on a rock.

Today it emerged Schumacher made a will to distribute his £750million cash, cars and property empire among his wife and two children just three years before the ski accident which has brought him to the brink of death.

Back in 2010 he admitted that he made a will for the first time, telling a German magazine: 'Yes, I have made my testament because I am a family man. But it is less about Formula One but because of the things that can happen in everyday life.'

That premonition of 'everyday life' came sadly true on December 29 last year when he smashed his head on to a rock while skiing at the French resort of Meribel.

The will, he said, 'covers all those who are important to me'.

On Sunday his father Rold and brother Ralf were among the close family visitors at his bedside in Grenoble's University Hospital. 

German media reported that a brain scan on Friday troubled his medical team but he had a quiet weekend.

Speculation is mounting that French prosecutors may be preparing charges against the operators of the piste where Schumi came a cropper.

Attorney Maurice Bodecher -  a specialist in the field of ski and criminal law and formerly Chief Judge of the French of Ski Federation until 2010 - has been retained by the piste management.

If any charges are laid they could pave the way for a multi-million pound lawsuit from the Schumacher family.

The main question, according to German media, is whether the scene of the accident - full of rocks of the type that Schumi collided with - was properly marked.
