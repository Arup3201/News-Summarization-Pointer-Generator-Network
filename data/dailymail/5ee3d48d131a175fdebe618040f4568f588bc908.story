Roma's 2-0 home defeat to Manchester City on Wednesday night was a painful remainder that they are well short of the European elite as the Serie A side crashed out of the Champions League in the group stages.

Roma made a premature exit following a poor campaign in which they won only one match in six games which included a 7-1 drubbing at home by Bayern Munich.

Roma's elimination leaves Juventus as Serie A's only representatives in the Champions League in what has become a sadly familiar scene for Italian football as La Gazzetta dello Sport lead with the headline: 'Goodbye Roma, now only Juventus remain'.

Tuttosport continued with the theme of Roma's European failure leading with a picture of a despondent Roma coach Rudi Garcia walking off the pitch at full time while Corriere dello Sport described the Italian side's loss as a 'bitter defeat'.

Although Roma president James Pallotta has been working hard to change their business methods in his two years at the club and has announced plans to build a new stadium, there is clearly a long way to go on the pitch. 

'We have to improve the squad to reach this standard," said coach Rudi Garcia. 'This is not our standard at the moment and that is normal when you take our revenue into account.

'(Manchester City) have more experience and maturity, but I have no regrets. The Europa League is also a high-level competition and we will try to go as far as possible.

'If we want to play the Champions League next year we have to play really well in Serie A and be ready to do this right from next Sunday."

Roma, second in Serie A and three points behind leaders Juventus, visit third-placed Genoa in their next league game on Sunday.

'I will try to and get this disappointment from the heads of my players and we'll take the championship as our number one goal,' added Garcia. 

Italian clubs have not progressed beyond the quarter-finals in the last four seasons and their interest last term ended in the round of sixteen when AC Milan were thumped by Atletico Madrid.

Roma's demise remained the theme of the day as Corriere dello Sport lead with the headline: Roma Out! 

Expectations have lowered so much that just having a chance to qualify on Wednesday was considered a bonus by Roma's players.

'Nobody thought we would still be in contention in the final game,' said midfielder Radja Nainggolan.

'We did well to get to the final round of matches in a group against teams who have won everything,"'added Adem Ljajic.
