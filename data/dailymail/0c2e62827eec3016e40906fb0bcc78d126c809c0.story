In a major boost for the global economy, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 15000 points for the first time on Tuesday.

Ending the day 87 points up on Monday, the Dow closed up 0.6 percent to 15,056.20 - the latest landmark in a near four-year rally which has seen the stock market rise 130 percent.

The historic gains will fuel growing confidence in the U.S. economy, but the Federal Reserve is not expected to relax its policy of keeping interest rates at almost zero - seen by many as a key supporting factor in the rise of the Dow.

Record: The Dow Jones Industrial Average today reached its highest ever level at 15,013

Analysts have attributed the steady rise of the NYSE to investors fear of missing out on the rally replacing their concerns about the risk of a sell off.

Earlier today, the stockmarket hit new highs as the Dow passed a record-breaking 15,000.

The index, which tracks the value of 30 of the biggest American companies, smashed through 15,000, before falling back slightly.

The
S&P 500 also reached its highest level ever as the prolonged stock 
rally showed no sign of slowing down despite the struggling global 
economy.

The S&P 
has risen for three straight days, increasing more than 13 per cent so 
far this year - more than in the whole of 2012.

Yesterday it closed at a record high of 1,617, and today reached an intraday high of 1,620.

The strong performance of equities in recent days has been attributed to last week's strong employment figures from the U.S., as well as the Federal Reserve's stimulus programme.

Healthy profits at major U.S. corporations are also driving the market higher.

More than 80 per cent of companies in the S&P 500 have reported their first quarter-earnings, and profits are at a record level.

However, revenues have been less promising as gross sales have falled short of expectations so far this year.

The Dow, which is up more than 14 per cent this year, first passed 15,000 on Friday, but has still never closed above that level in any given day.

Both of the main indices have been setting a series of records after regaining all of the losses they suffered in the 2008 financial crisis.

Recent gains have been especially strong in technology and banking, which tend to rise or fall sharply in sync with the overall health of the global economy.

Another good sign for the global economy is that the price of ultra-safe assets such as U.S. government bonds has been falling, showing investors are ready to take more risks with their money.

However, renewed turmoil in the eurozone and the risk of U.S. government shutdown could yet shake world market in the months to come.
