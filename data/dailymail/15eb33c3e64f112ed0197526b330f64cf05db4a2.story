The RCM said while midwife numbers were increasing a little, the strain on numbers has led to antenatal care of expectant mothers becoming 'threadbare'

Women in labour are being turned away from maternity units as midwives are overwhelmed by record numbers of births.

With immigrants helping push birth rates in England to their highest level for 40 years, more than half of maternity wards admit shutting their doors an average of seven times a year when the strain on midwives becomes too great.

Expectant women who then turn up are sent away to other hospitals.

Research by The Royal College of Midwives says that thousands of new midwives are needed if the ‘massive gap’ in staffing is to be plugged, the ‘relentless rise in births’ handled and for mothers and babies to be given the quality of care they need.

Yesterday Cathy Warwick, chief 
executive of the RCM, warned of ‘threadbare’ services with midwives 
‘running themselves ragged’. She said: ‘Maternity units are under 
intense strain, with many midwives really at the end of their tether. We
 are reaching a crucial tipping point for maternity services.’

The RCM’s State Of Maternity Services 
report, which will be launched at an event in Parliament tomorrow, says 
that although there have been attempts to boost midwife numbers, England
 alone still needs another 5,000 – an increase of about a quarter on 
today’s level.

Office for National Statistics figures
 show there were 688,120 babies born in England in 2011, the most since 
1971.

The trend seems set to continue, with provisional data for 2012 
pointing to it being another record-breaker and ONS projections 
suggesting the birth rate in England could hit 743,000 by 2014.

Corby in Northamptonshire saw the 
biggest baby boom, with a 63 per cent jump between 2002 and 2011 – three
 times the rise across England as a whole.

Other hotspots include 
Bournemouth, with a 54 per cent increase, Boston, Lincolnshire (53.5 per
 cent), the London borough of Barking and Dagenham (52.5 per cent) and 
Slough in Berkshire, which saw a 50.5 per cent rise.

Immigration is one factor, with 
foreign-born mothers now having nearly a quarter of all babies in 
Britain, but the RCM report says midwives are also struggling to look 
after record numbers of older mothers, who are more prone to 
complications.

Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, has warned England alone needs an extra 5,000 midwives

The report follows a survey of new mothers which found 
that despite a Government pledge for mothers-to-be to have their care 
overseen by one midwife, 40 per cent always saw a different one.

Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said 
that more than 800 new midwives have started work since 2010, and 5,000 
more are due to qualify in the next three years.

He added: ‘The number of midwives is 
increasing faster than the birth rate. Most women already have 
one-to-one maternity care, and we are working closely with The Royal 
College of Midwives to ensure that is available for every woman.’

Thousands of patients are at risk from
 appalling care reminiscent of scandal-hit Stafford Hospital, the health
 secretary has claimed.

Jeremy Hunt’s warning comes just weeks
 before the report of a public inquiry into the deaths of up to 1,200 
people from poor care in the hospital’s A&E department between 2005 
and 2009.

He said that while there are no 
hospitals as bad as Stafford, ‘there are little bits of Stafford dotted 
around the system’.

He added: ‘The biggest change the NHS needs to make 
is to embed compassion at the heart of what it does.’
