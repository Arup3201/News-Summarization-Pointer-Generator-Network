The Dallas hospital that treated America's Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan is offering its employees rooms so they can avoid exposing their family and friends  to the virus

Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital has made rooms available to the healthcare workers that treated Mr Duncan, who was the first person to die from Ebola on U.S. soil.

Employees choosing to stay at the hospital will be housed in rooms in a separate part of the establishment throughout their monitoring period.

In a statement, hospital officials said the precaution is not a medical recommendation but is for employees' peace of mind.

'We want to remind potentially affected employees that they are not contagious unless and until they demonstrate any symptoms, yet we understand this is a frightening situation for them and their families,' they said.

'We will be coordinating this effort with the county monitors who are already regularly checking on their temperatures for any sign of infection. The hospital will contact directly those being monitored to make arrangements.'

The hospital also asked that anyone who may be affected to be 'good citizens' and avoid using public transportation or engaging in any other activities that could put others at risk.

Mr Duncan, 42, was diagnosed with the deadly disease at the end of September after returning from a trip to Liberia. He died from the virus on October 8.

Since his death, two nurses who had cared for Mr Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian have been diagnosed with the disease.

Nina Pham, 26, a Texas Christian University nursing school graduate, is in isolation being treated for the disease after being diagnosed at the weekend. 

Nurse Amber Joy Vinson, 29, was transferred to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia on Wednesday. She is said to be 'ill but clinically stable'. 

The  hospital  has since apologized for the first time in their mismanaged handling of the outbreak. 

The Dallas hospital's Chief Clinical Officer Dr Daniel Varga admits they 'made mistakes' when Duncan first showed up at the hospital with Ebola symptoms.

He was initially sent away with antibiotics, despite telling health care workers that he had recently arrived from Liberia - one of the three countries currently battling the largest outbreak of the disease in history.

'Unfortunately, in our initial treatment of Mr. Duncan, despite our best intentions and a highly skilled medical team, we made mistakes. We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry,' Dr Varga says in a statement to Congress, released Wednesday.

A Congressional committee had called Dr Varga to testify on Thursday, but he said he would not be able to make the meeting in person since he is busy dealing with the crisis at his hospital.

While Dr Varga apologized for the initial misdiagnosis of Duncan, he says once the patient was brought back to the hospital he was 'treated with the most appropriate and available medical interventions'.

When Duncan succumbed to the disease last week, the entire hospital grieved.

'It was devastating to the nurses, doctors, and team who tried so hard to save his life. We keep his family in our thoughts and prayers,' Dr Varga said.

Included in the statement, is a section on 'lessons learned and steps taken' in the aftermath of Duncan's death, and the subsequent diagnosis of two nurses.

Dr Varga writes that staff are now taking travel history from patients at 'first point of contact' in the emergency room.

They are also taking a more 'proactive, intensive' approach to training staff on how to deal with Ebola.

'We are determined to be an agent for change across the US healthcare system by helping our peers benefit from our experience,' Dr Varga wrote.
