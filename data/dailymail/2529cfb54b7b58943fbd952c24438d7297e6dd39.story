A US study found people who take statins to fight heart disease could be 27 per cent more likely to develop cataracts

Millions of people who take  statins to fight heart disease could be 27 per cent more likely to develop cataracts, researchers warn.

Older people are particularly susceptible because they make up the majority of statin users and patients with cataracts, which cloud the eye and require surgery to prevent blindness.

US researchers checked the medical notes of 14,000 people over more than eight years, divided equally between those who had used statins for at least three months and those had never taken the drugs.

The scientists found the increased risk of 27 per cent for statin users held up even after they accounted for other factors  that could explain the result, such as high blood pressure.

They said cholesterol was necessary to maintain healthy cells in the eye and the transparency of the lens.

More than eight million Britons take statins – the most widely prescribed drugs in the UK. GPs wrote out 61million prescriptions in England alone during 2011.

The drugs are only given to patients with at least a 20 per cent risk of having a heart attack or stroke within ten years.

Research from Oxford University looking at 27 statin trials involving 175,000 people, some of whom were at low risk of heart problems, found the drugs cut the risk of heart attacks, strokes and operations to unblock arteries by at least a third.

The effects helped all patients, even those who started out with the highest cholesterol levels. Healthier people who were given statins also had lower overall death rates than those who were given a placebo.

It concluded the benefits greatly exceeded any side-effects from taking the drugs.

There have been calls for everyone over 50 to be offered statins because it would stop some from having their first heart attack.But in a report in the journal JAMA  Ophthalmology yesterday, the US researchers behind the latest study warned this could be counterproductive because of the increased raised cataract risk.

Dr Jessica Leuschen, of San Antonio Military Medical Center, Texas, added: ‘This study found statin use to be associated with an increased risk for cataract. Weighing the benefit-risk ratio of statin use, specifically for primary prevention, should be carefully considered.’

Her thorough study follows mixed results from earlier research, with one report claiming statins make patients up to 50 per cent less likely to develop cataracts.

Around one in three people over 65 develop cataracts, and 341,000 operations were carried out last year on the NHS.

Clara Eaglen, of the Royal National Institute for Blind People, said: ‘Many people are prescribed statins to help lower their  cholesterol and if they have any concerns about their medication they should discuss this with their GP before taking any action.

‘Cataracts can prevent some people from driving, undertaking work that requires fine detail and recognising faces.

‘Any research which could help prevent unnecessary sight loss through eye conditions such as cataracts is a welcome step.’

As well as cataracts, research has linked statins to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, constipation, diarrhoea, headaches, loss of appetite and loss of sensation or pain in the nerve endings of the hands and feet.

The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Products Agency has also warned about the risk of sleep disturbances, memory loss, sexual dysfunction, depression and certain lung diseases.
