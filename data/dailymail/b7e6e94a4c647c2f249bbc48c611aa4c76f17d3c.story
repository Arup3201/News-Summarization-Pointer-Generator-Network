Walking free: Genene Jones, 64, will be released from prison in February 2018

A pediatric nurse who allegedly murdered more than 40 infants in the 1980s and was sent to prison for 99 years is up for parole this week.

The parole board will almost certainly vote to keep Genene Jones behind bars. But no matter what the board does, she will walk free in less than four years. 

'She's probably going to be the first serial killer in this country's history to be legally released,' Andy Kahan, a Houston crime victim advocate told KHOU-TV. 

Jones, now age 64, is suspected of murdering dozens of infants by injecting them with a combination of drugs at two hospitals in San Antonio and Kerrville, Texas, between 1971 and 1984. Some estimates say she killed as many as 46 children.

However, she was only convicted of two crimes - the murder of 15-month-old Chelsea McClellan and the attempted murder of Rolando Jones, who was 18 months old at the time. 

Her 99-year prison sentence was reduced by one third because of Texas sentencing laws at the time. She was put away in 1985. She is scheduled to be released in February 2018. 

Authorities have only one recourse - to find new evidence and convict her of a new crime related to the 30-year-old murders. 

However, hospital records of the infant deaths were destroyed long ago. Prosecutors at the time tried to find the evidence to charge her with additional infant deaths - but only had the grounds to pursue he two cases that sent Jones to prison. 

'This is an individual who should never be out of prison,' Bexar County District Attorney Susan Reed said. 

Ms Reed is spear-heading the effort to dig up new leads. 

With the help of Mr Kahan, Ms Reed is pursuing a strategy to kept another serial killer from being released.Coral Watts was due to be released in 2006, despite having confessed to killing 13 women in the Houston area in 2006. 

A massive public campaign led a new witness to come forward that allowed him to be convicted of a new murder - which kept him behind bars until his death in 2007.

Jones was only convicted of one murder and one attempted murder  - despite suspicions that she murdered up to 46 infants while working at two Texas hospitals
