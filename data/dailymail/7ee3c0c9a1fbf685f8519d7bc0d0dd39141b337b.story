A producer for TV adventurer Bear Grylls who suffered a horrific snake bite on his foot was today pictured resting following surgery - but the photo is still so grim that we can't publish it.

Steve Rankin suffered the bite while filming the survival expert's latest TV show in California- and a picture posted by Bear of the original injury went viral.

The graphic photo, which was sure to have put a fair few of Bear's Twitter followers off their lunch, was taken three weeks ago, according to the Huffington Post, and showed that the wild clearly won in that particular showdown.

Bear Grylls, pictured at a sitting for Madame Tussauds today, tweeted a graphic picture of a snakebite received by one of the production team while filming for his latest show

Much of the flesh on the producer's foot had  been stripped away exposing some of his bones.

Alongside the original photo, a caption read: 'Our man vs wild producer suffering from a brutal snakebite - fighting the injury with courage.'

Despite his horrific injury Mr Rankin was said to be on the mend having undergone surgery.

He posted a picture of the foot post-surgery on Twitter and said: 'Thanks Bear for your good wishes', before telling a follower: 'Resting up.'

The original picture by Bear has since gone viral and received many horrified reactions from some of the adventurer's 1million followers.

The intrepid explorer didn't elaborate on the injury, where filming was taking place when the snake attacked or what type of snake caused the damage to Mr Rankin's foot.

According to reports, the team were filming for a forthcoming series called 'Naked and Afraid'.

The former SAS soldier became a global star after eating insects and drinking his own urine to survive in the wild.

In demand: BBC, ITV and Channel 4 are said to be in a bidding war for the survival expert's latest show which is to air in the US

His most recent show, Get Out Alive will air in the US this summer and sees 20 ordinary people set a range of tough challenges with a £500,000 prize at stake.

He recently signed a deal with Discovery enabling him to work with terrestrial broadcasters in the UK for the first time.

And that deal is said to have sparked something of a bidding war between the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 to win the rights to Get Out Alive.

Grylls, who is also the UK's Chief Scout, is also expected to begin filming on another new show called Ultimate Survivor.
