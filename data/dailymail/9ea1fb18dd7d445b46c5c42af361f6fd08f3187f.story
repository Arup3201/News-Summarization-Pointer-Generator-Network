A puppy so small it has be fed with a pipette is believed to Britain's tiniest pooch. 

Tyson the chihuahua-cross was rejected by his siblings at birth after being too small to suckle on its mother. 

After being thrown out of the litter-of-five, the animal was examined by vets who believe he could be the nation's smallest dog.

Tyson the puppy weighs just 11 ounces and is only 4in tall. The dog is thought to be the smallest in Britain 

The chihuahua cross was rejected from his litter-of-five at birth because he was too small to suckle 

His owner, Rosemarie McLinden from Keal Cotes, Lincolnshire, carries Tyson around in a hamster cage.

The 46-year-old has had to make special arrangements to make sure the tiny animal isn't lost in the mix of her other pets. 

'He was tiny when he was born and he was eventually pushed out by his brothers and sisters because he was so tiny.'

'He just hasn't really grown since.

'I had to start feeding him myself as he couldn't latch on to his mother. He was so small he just could not breastfeed due to the tiny size of his mouth.

'I bought a little dropper and had to feed him day and night every two hours until he was a little bigger.

'We had to take him away from the rest of the litter because he is so small they think of him as a squeaky toy.

'I’ve been doing a lot of research and I can’t see a smaller dog anywhere in the entire country.'

Mrs McLinden has built a special crate for the dog to sleep in, but cannot find a collar small enough for his little neck. 

Speaking of the other dogs in his litter of Chihuahua Lhasa Apso crosses, the mother-of-four said: 'They are all so boisterous, but he is just too small to be boisterous, he’s just an energetic loving pup.

The tiny animal was fed by a pipette for weeks after being too small to suckle on its mother at birth

Vets believe Tyson, a Chihuahua Lhasa Apso cross, may be the smallest dog in Britain 

Tyson sleeps in a special crate built by his owners and chases toes and golf balls which are bigger than his head

The previous smallest dog in Britain was a 5in Yorkshire terrior called Pagan from Hull. Tyson (pictured) is 4in

'He loves toes, he will chase them and give you a nip, but they are bigger than him.

'He has one ball that he likes to chase, we found a practice golf ball that he can use, but even that is bigger than his head.

'We’ve just started trying to wean him onto dog food, and we have to rub around his little gums to help him eat.

'He seems do be doing well though and we hope he stays fit and healthy.'

Tyson joins a menagerie of animals at the family home which already has two kittens, a bearded dragon, sheep, horses, chickens and a hedgehog.

Vet Sharon Crocket, of Pilgrim Veterinary Surgery, in Boston, Lincolnshire, where Tyson has been treated, said: 'He could possibly be the smallest dog in the UK.

'He is so tiny, even for a part Chihuahua.'

Previously the smallest dog in the UK was five-inch tall Yorkshire terrier Pagan, from Hull, Yorkshire.
