More than 850 Britons are currently locked up in overseas prisons for drug-related offences and face potential jail sentences of up to 39 years or the death penalty.

Offences that may carry cautions in the UK are often punished with long prison sentences overseas - and travellers don't realise it.

Drugs crimes often carry the most severe sentences, and in 33 countries around the world they carry the death penalty.

Thailand - Possession of even very small quantities of drugs can lead to imprisonment.

If you are found guilty of being in possession of a small quantity of marijuana you are risking a prison sentence and a heavy fine.

If you are found guilty of being in possession of in excess of 20 grams of a Class A drug you would be deemed as a trafficker and could potentially be sentenced to death.

United Arab Emirates - Sentences for drug trafficking for possession of even the smallest amount of illegal drugs can lead to a minimum four-year jail sentence.

The Emirati authorities count the presence of drugs in the blood stream as possession.

Peru - More than 30 British nationals are currently in prison in Peru for drugs offences. Drug smugglers face long terms of imprisonment.

Indonesia - Possession, trafficking and manufacture of any illegal drugs are serious offences in Indonesia.

The Indonesian authorities have a zero-tolerance policy and those caught face lengthy prison sentences or the death penalty, usually after a protracted and expensive legal process.

The FCO said the zero-tolerance 
approach of some countries often results in strict penalties which can 
come as a shock to British travellers.

Prisoners Abroad is currently supporting 80 Britons between the ages of 18 and 30 held in foreign countries for drugs offences.

Two thirds of these are still awaiting trial while others are serving sentences from a year to nearly 39 years.

Consular affairs minister Mark Simmonds said: 'People continue to be astonished at some of the penalties handed down for certain crimes overseas. In some countries possessing small amounts of marijuana can lead to decades in prison.

'In the last year alone consular staff handled over 650 drug-related cases. We want to reduce this number significantly.'

He went on: 'Laws, penalties and sentences vary considerably around the world for the use, possession and trafficking of all types of drugs. When it comes to drugs our message is clear - don't take risks, the consequences are simply not worth it.'

Prisoners Abroad chief executive Pauline Crowe said: 'In many countries, men and women find themselves without access to food, clean water and the most basic of medical care.

'We urge people to consider the unsanitary conditions, overcrowded cells and the constant threat of disease before they get involved in drugs. They may have to live through these conditions for many, many years.'
