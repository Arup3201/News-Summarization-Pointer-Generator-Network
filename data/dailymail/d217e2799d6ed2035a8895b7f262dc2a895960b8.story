Increase: The number of operations cancelled on the day they were due to go ahead has hit its highest total for nine years, according to official figures

The number of operations cancelled on the day they were due to go ahead has hit its highest total for nine years, according to official figures.

In a sign of mounting pressure on many NHS trusts, it has emerged that between April and June 15,661 scheduled operations were cancelled at the last minute for non-medical reasons.

That is the highest since the same three months in 2005 when 15,690 operations were cancelled on the day they were supposed to be carried out.

But the Department of Health said the proportion of operations cancelled at the last minute is only 0.8 per cent, around the same as in previous years.

It said the proportion has not changed because doctors carried out more than half a million more operations this year than in the same period eight years ago, driven by the ageing population and medical advances.

Labour blames increases in the number of patients attending accident and emergency departments for the rise in cancelled operations.

This spring the vast majority of patients affected had their operation rescheduled within a month, but 800 were left waiting longer.

The data, published by NHS England, relates to elective operations – scheduled in advance – not emergency surgery.

In the same quarter of 2006 the number of cancelled operations was only 12,548. In spring 2011, the year after the Coalition came to power, it was 12,780.

NHS guidance states that common non-medical reasons for cancelling an operation include lack of ward beds available, the lack of an available surgeon, anaesthetist or theatre staff; an emergency case needing the theatre, equipment failure, or lack of a critical care bed.

Last week figures from NHS England showed there are now 3.2million people on NHS waiting lists for operations, with some being forced to wait more than a year.

The total is the highest since the target of treating 90 per cent of patients with 18 weeks was introduced six years ago.

Ministers admit it may not be met again for months while the backlog is cleared.

But a spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was important to reduce the waiting list responsibly – rather than try to meet the target by prioritising simple procedures rather than complex but life-changing operations which take longer. 

Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘Not only are people waiting longer for operations, increasing numbers are facing the appalling anxiety and indignity of preparing for treatment only to be let down just hours before surgery.

‘Hospitals are full to bursting, with record numbers in A&E, and this is threatening to drag down the rest of the NHS.’

An NHS England spokesman said: ‘NHS England believes all cancellations should be avoided wherever possible. However, the level of cancellations remains low, in the context of the millions of operations performed in the NHS each year.’

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘The number of operations cancelled in this quarter has remained steady at less than 1 per cent of all elective admissions, despite the fact that the NHS is responding to significantly increased demand by performing more than half a million more operations now than in the same period eight years ago.’
