These dramatic photographs show a huge fire breaking out last night in the bell tower of a Russian monastery dating from the 16th century.

The blaze at the Novodevichy Convent in Moscow broke out late yesterday in wooden scaffolding surrounding the tower as it undergoes restoration.

The emergencies ministry for Moscow said the tower itself did not suffer significant damage and the fire's spread had been halted around midnight.

One vivid image showed shocked orthodox nuns watching firefighters extinguishing the blaze last night.

The octagonal tower, which is more than 200ft tall and dates from the late 1600s, is on the site of one of the Russian capital's top visitor attractions.

The convent - which was founded in the 1520s - sits above an oxbow turn in the Moscow River, and is noted both for its buildings and its cemetery.

Many of Russia's most celebrated figures are buried there, including Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and Russia's first president, Boris Yeltsin.

Also among those buried there is playwright Anton Chekhov, and composers Dmitri Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev.

Tower: Built in the so-called Moscow Baroque style, the convent was part of a series of monasteries integrated into the city’s defence system

Top attraction: The convent was closed in 1922 and became the Museum of Women’s Emancipation before reopening as another museum

How it normally looks: A nunnery was reintroduced there two decades ago in 1994, and it was given Unesco World Heritage status in 2004

The convent, built in the so-called Moscow Baroque style, was part of a series of monasteries that were integrated into the city’s defence system.

It contains what Unesco states is an ‘important collection of paintings and artefacts’, and was used by women of the Tsar’s family and the aristocracy.

The convent was closed in 1922 and became the Museum of Women’s Emancipation, before later being reopened as an historical and art museum.

A nunnery was reintroduced there two decades ago in 1994, and it was given Unesco World Heritage status ten years later in 2004.
