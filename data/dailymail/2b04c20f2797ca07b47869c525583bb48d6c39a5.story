A firefighter has been struck down by a rare condition that left him paralysed in just three hours.

Chris Wardman, 41 was refereeing a football match when he suddenly suffered crippling chest pains and within three hours paralysis had had spread from his legs up to his chest.

The father of three from Beverley, East Yorkshire, was diagnosed with transverse myelitis - inflammation of the spinal cord - for which there is no cure.

Mr Wardman said: 'My nerves are shot to bits. Cold feels hot and hot feels cold. Clothes feel as though they are lined with glass.

'My wife and kids are only half a mile away from where I am now but I can only be with them for a few hours a week.

Transverse myelitis is a neurological condition that triggers inflammation of the spinal cord.

It is thought to be caused by a virus experts remain unsure of the exact cause.

It is very rare and affects just 300 Britons each year.

Symptoms include weakness, 'heaviness' and numbness of the limbs.

In severe cases this can lead to total paralysis.

It may also cause someone to be more sensitive to touch, cold, and heat.

There may also be tight and painful muscle contractions (known as
tonic muscle spasms).

The symptoms and signs depend upon the extent of the spinal cord affected.

Around 70 per cent of sufferers will never recover but intensive physiotherapy can help reduce symptoms.

'No-one knows what brings it on. At least if you fall off a ladder, you know why you can’t walk, but with this, you just don’t know and that’s the frustration.'

He has spent four months in hospital, first at Hull Royal Infirmary, before being transferred to East Riding Community Hospital.

Before being struck by the virus in April, Mr Wardman, a well-respected firefighter of ten years, had always prided himself on his fitness.

'It then got worse. Over the next two hours, the numbness went up my body, right up to my chest.'

Doctors first thought Me Wardman was suffering a stroke, but blood tests and scans confirmed it was transverse myelitis.

The condition, which affects about 300 Britons a year, is the result of the immune system attacking healthy tissue.

Describing the moment he felt suddenly 
unwell, he said: 'It felt like I was having a heart attack or a stroke. 
It was a really sharp pain in my chest.

'The paramedics came but couldn’t find anything wrong with me.

'My wife Hayley took me home, and within an hour my right leg was paralysed.

Some experts believe that it could be triggered by a simple viral infection, but the cause is unknown.

If the spinal cord becomes inflamed, nerve signals from the brain to the body can be interrupted.

Mr Wardman has been told by experts that 70 per cent of sufferers will never recover but that intensive physiotherapy can help reduce symptoms and he is determined to walk again.

He said: 'I’ve heard around a third of sufferers will make a full recovery. I am going to be in that third.

'When you’re told most will end up in a wheelchair for life you think, "Oh my God". But I’m determined to do it, for my family’s sake.'

Mr Wardman only gets to leave hospital for a few hours each week to visit his family, including his children - Alanah, 19 months, Sienna, nine, and Macauley, 13.

He said: 'The biggest drain is not being able to play with my kids. They all come and see me every day, but it’s not the same as being at home.'
