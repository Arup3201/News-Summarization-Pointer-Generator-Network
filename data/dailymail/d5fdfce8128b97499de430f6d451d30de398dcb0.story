A man has been charged for abusing his girlfriend's dog after he was secretly filmed by a neighbor who couldn't bear the alleged cruelty.

Ryan Francis Baker, 32, from Medford, Massachusetts, was arrested by police on 17 March after his neighbour handed over videos showing him throwing the 18-month-old pitbull around his back garden.

The dog, called Bullet, was owned by Baker's girlfriend, who brought him around to the house during weekends and holidays.

The neighbor who supplied the video clips to police, Ed Moyer, told Fox News Boston: 'To see a dog put through that, it was just so inhumane, you know. It was disturbing.'

Moyer later told WCVB.com: 'I witnessed the abuse of this dog dozens of times.

'I can hear the dog yelping, screaming, crying uncontrollably. It's heartbreaking from 100 yards away, and she's in the house 10 yards away.' 

Baker's girlfriend, who has not been named, was unaware that Baker had been mercilessly abusing her pet.

Medford police arrested Baker after receiving the three videos which allegedly show him punching and kicking the dog. He also allegedly threw it around the yard at rear of his property.

A police statement said: 'In the video, the dog showed various indications that he feared Ryan Baker.'

Bullet the dog was found with a small cut over his right eye, but seems otherwise to be in good health.

In one of the video clips, Baker is allegedly show flinging the dog between 15 and 20 feet onto a tree.

Bully: Baker was arrested and appeared at Somerville District Court. Before the footage was shown, the court was warned that its contents were highly disturbing

Defence: Baker told Medford Police that he was just 'throwing a dog into a pile of snow', claiming that Bullet was having fun and that no harm was done

Fear: Bullet, an 18-month-old pit bull, is believed to have been thrown between 15 and 20 feet into a tree trunk, according to Medford Police Department

Bullet has since been returned to his owner, and it is understood that Baker's father posted the $1,000 bail.

Baker was taken to Somerville District Court, where the prosecution warned that the footage was disturbing. 

'The first video shows kicking of this dog repeatedly in the head,' he said. 'During the entire video, the dog is visibly shaking and cowering.'

Baker swore at police when asked to explain his actions. 'All for throwing a dog into a pile of snow,' he said. 'I was having fun throwing him into the snow pile.' 

A detective replied: 'You saw the video. It doesn't look the like the dog was having fun.'
