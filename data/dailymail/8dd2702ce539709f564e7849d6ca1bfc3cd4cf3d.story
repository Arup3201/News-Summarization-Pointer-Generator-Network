A winter storm landed a final punch on the U.S. mid-Atlantic states on Monday just days before spring begins, dumping more than a foot of snow in some places.

The onslaught of cold weather ended up shutting schools, federal offices and cancelling flights.

Traditional green worn on St. Patrick's Day was hidden under the winter coats of children enjoying one more sledding day and of road crews manning plows days ahead of the official start of spring on Thursday.

'Hardest hit was the Washington, D.C., area,' said meteorologist Brian Korty of the National Weather Service.

He
 said a few snow flurries would linger until the afternoon, but the 
storm that hit Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and southern New Jersey had 
largely moved out to sea.

The highest snowfall recorded was 13.5 inches in Singers Glen, Virginia, about 130 miles west of Washington, D.C.

Snow and ice snarled travel at the start of the work week, with the most severe impact at Reagan 
National Airport, where runways were 'closed due to heavy accumulation 
and blowing snow,' according to the Metropolitan Washington Airports 
Authority website.

The winter storm shut down federal offices in Washington, and dozens of schools in the area also remained closed.

This is the fifth time this winter season that the government was forced to close as a result of snow.

The nation's capital prepared for the storm overnight and had 200 plows clearing the roads as the first inches came down.Â 

Cold
 air pushing southward across both the Midwest and Great Lakes is 
causing a late round of snow and sleet starting in Missouri and carrying
 eastward along the Ohio River, Accuweather.com reports.

The weather is expected to impact the Monday morning commute

As it moves north, the severity of the snowfall will lessen.

Philadelphia has received one to three inches, and New York has not even been touched.

New York City is being protected by cold dry air that will keep the heaviest snow out of the region, Accuweather says.

Some snow may 'graze' the St. Patrick's Day Parade in New York on Monday but it is not expected to be as bad as its southern peers.

Icy conditions are expected in North Carolina on Monday morning, Accuweather says. A second storm may cause freezing rain to hit the state Monday night going into Tuesday -- it may also hit Virginia and Washington, D.C.
