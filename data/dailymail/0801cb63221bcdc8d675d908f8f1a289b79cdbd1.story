West Bromwich Albion turned to Tony Pulis for his remarkable record of never being relegated – but seven years ago the matchday programme was rather less complimentary.

As manager of Stoke, a piece from the 2007-08 season savaged his methods. 'Stoke train with cannons rescued from local medieval ruins,' read the article.

'Footballs are loaded into them and fired into the distance for [Mamady] Sidibe to head and [Ricardo] Fuller to run after. It’s a game plan that squeezes the life out of what used to be known as football.’ 

Tony Pulis was unveiled as West Bromwich Albion manager at The Hawthorns on Friday

That was the campaign West Brom, under Tony Mowbray, and Stoke were rivals for promotion out of the the Championship. As it happened they finished first and second respectively and both went up.

Stoke beat West Brom 3-1 at the Britannia, with Fuller scoring a hat-trick and earning a place in the Championship team of the year. It was 1-1 at The Hawthorns in the reverse fixture.

Clearly attitudes change and it is Pulis’ improbable run of staying afloat wherever he has been in 22 years of management that appeals most to chairman Jeremy Peace.

At Crystal Palace, Pulis got his side playing some good stuff too, a punchy, counter-attacking style full of vim and potency. He could well do the same at West Brom.

The appointment brought a wry observation from one of Pulis’ former players though. Matty Etherington was bought  in January 2009 to aid Stoke’s first season of 'survival' in the Premier League. The Potter comfortably finished 12th.

'Pulis to W’Brom?’ Etherington tweeted. 'Strange old game, remember W'Brom fans barraging him when he was at Stoke, "Hoof ball".’

Tellingly, he added: 'He will keep them up #getsresults’
