Jonathan Trott has been named in an England Lions squad to tour South Africa in January as he takes his first tentative steps back into Test cricket.

The 33-year-old batsman who came home from last winter's Ashes tour after suffering a stress related illness has not played international cricket since.

But his success with Warwickshire, where he scored three centuries in the last month of the season, has encouraged him and the ECB to believe he is capable of touring again.

 Jonathan Trott is expected to be named in an England Lions squad to tour South Africa in January

First-class squad to face South Africa A

Jonny Bairstow (Yorkshire), Gary Ballance (Yorkshire), Sam Billings (Kent), Jack Brooks (Yorkshire), Alex Lees (Yorkshire), Adam Lyth (Yorkshire), Craig Overton (Somerset), Liam Plunkett (Yorkshire), Boyd Rankin (Warwickshire), Adil Rashid (Yorkshire), Adam Riley (Kent), Sam Robson (Middlesex), Jonathan Trott (Warwickshire), James Vince (Hampshire). 

Jason Roy (Surrey), Stephen Parry (Lancashire) and Samit Patel (Notts) will replace Trott, Robson and Riley in the 50-over squad to face South Africa A  

He tweeted: 'Delighted to be included in Lions trip and looking forward to being part of the England set up again.'

England selector James Whitaker said: 'Jonathan Trott’s exceptional form and run scoring exploits for Warwickshire at the end of the summer has resulted in his selection for the First Class fixtures at the beginning of the tour. Congratulations to him and to all of the players selected.'

Trott signed a new three-year contract with Warwickshire last Thursday after enjoying a revival in form.

He made a delayed start to the campaign after a recurrence of the illness in April, but found form quickly after making his return for his county.

'Warwickshire CCC is a very special club for me and my family and I would like to thank everyone associated with the club for their support,' said Trott.

Since returning to action with Warwickshire, Trott has scored 1,156 runs and earned a new three-year deal

(First-class matches only) 

Matches 9 Innings 14 Runs 628 

Highest Score 164 Average 44.85 

Hundreds 3 Fifties 1 

'It has always been a great honour to represent the Bears and I am delighted to commit to the club once again for a further three years.'

There are seven players from county champions Yorkshire in the squad, including Gary Ballance, who starred for England during the summer.

Opening batsman Sam Robson of Middlesex is also in the Lions touring party. 

Kent duo Sam Billings and Adam Riley are two of the more unfamiliar names in the squad. Riley, 22, is an off-spinner and 23-year-old Billings is a wicketkeeper-batsman.
