West Brom are on the trail of Rayo Vallecano striker Alberto Bueno.

The 26-year-old is out of contract next summer and could be available for a knock-down price in January. 

Bueno has already scored four goals in four games this season and has begun to attract interest from a number of clubs around Europe.

The Baggies enjoyed their first win of the season last weekend when they beat Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham side 1-0.

A second-half James Morrison header was enough to depart White Hart Lane with all three points. 

Next up for West Brom in the Premier League is a visit from newly-promoted side Burnley, who, like Alan Irvine's side, have struggled for goals this season.

The forward's contract is up at the end of the season so he could be available on the cheap in January
