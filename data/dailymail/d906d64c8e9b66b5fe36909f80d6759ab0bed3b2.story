It is a record Shadow the lurcher could do without. After more than 260 days, he is the longest-staying resident at Battersea Cats and  Dogs Home. 

The sweet and loving four-year-old lurcher is a firm favourite with staff at the charity.

But while they are glad of his company, they are at a loss to explain why he has not yet found a home.

Plea: After 260 days at Battersea, Shadow was desperate to find a new home

Innocent: What you will be getting should you decide to take in Shadow

The average dog stays for 35 days – Shadow has been there more than seven times longer.

Like 46 per cent of Battersea dogs, Shadow was brought in by his owners last July as they could no longer care for him.

Rob Young, head of rehoming, said: ‘Poor Shadow must feel really unloved as he’s been here for so long and is desperate for a family to call his own. He’s such a gorgeous boy and will make a fantastic companion – we just can’t understand why he’s been with us for this length of time.

‘Hopefully Shadow’s luck will change soon and someone will fall for his charm.’

Friendly dog: Staff at the charity cannot understand why it took so long for the loving lurcher to find a home

Record stay: Shadow spent seven times longer at the Battersea kennels than the average dog

To break up his time in kennels, Shadow was placed in a foster home for two months.

Mr Young added: ‘Shadow did fantastically well in his foster home – he’s housetrained, travels well in the car, is very obedient and above all gave his foster parents lots of love and laughter.’

Director of communications at the home Dee McIntosh added: 'Battersea puts no time limit on rehoming a dog or cat and we’ll care for them for as long as it takes to find them what they long for the most – a loving new home.

'Sadly, if some dogs spend too long in kennels, they could start to show signs of severe stress and do downhill rapidly. But we will only put a dog to sleep if it has extreme behavioural problems and it is clear it is too dangerous to rehome into a family environment.

'Fortunately Shadow is not in that situation at all and simply longs for a second chance in life.'

So it seems while Shadow may get to continue his life for now, it is hoped that can be in a loving family rather than the home sooner rather than later.
