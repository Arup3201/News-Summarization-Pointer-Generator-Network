Jenson Button provided festive cheer to a number of unsuspecting banking customers by handing out free cash in a ‘Secret Santa’ stunt.

Button, the 2009 Formula One World Champion, hid inside an in-store Santander ATM as customers completed their regular transactions.

And when asked to push 'The Jenson Button', the British driver, donning his McLaren overalls, popped out from behind the screen with £100 to give to shocked punters.

The British driver left customers stunned following a 'Secret Santa' stunt by banking giants Santander 

Customers were urged to push 'The Jenson Button' before the F1 ace appeared from behind the screen

He then gave the customers, most of whom supplied hilariious reactions to the stunt, a gift basket. 

Button recently ended months of speculation surrounding his F1 future when he signed a two-year deal to partner McLaren at Fernando Alonso.

The 34-year-old's grand prix career seemed to be all but over with McLaren widely expected to name Kevin Magnussen alongside Alonso for the 2015 campaign.

But the British team completed a dramatic U-turn when they announced that Button, who outscored Magnussen last season, would team up with the former Ferrari driver for the next two years.
