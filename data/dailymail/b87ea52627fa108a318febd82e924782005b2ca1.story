Endless photographs have been taken of Sydney's iconic Opera House and Bondi Beach over the years - but none like this.

What started out as a passionate hobby for Pete Davies a year ago has been so successful that he has plans to eventually throw in his tech job to concentrate on taking the stunning images using a drone and a GoPro on a full time basis.

'As a day job, I would like to go more into the production side of using the drone and do it more commercially which would be nice,' he said.

'This is just something that I found and thought it would be good to see things differently.'

Pete Davies turned his hobby into his great passion: Using a drone and GoPro, he captures famous landmarks from a bird's eye view

The iconic Sydney Opera House photographed like never before: 'I  thought it would be good to see things differently,' said Davies

Davies has taken mesmerising different perspectives of Jervis Bay, Hyams beach and Kiama in southern New South Wales as well as Cronulla - just south of Sydney - and Port Stephens on the north coast (above, Stockton Beach in NSW)

1. Check equipment and batteries before sending up the drone

2. Use a first person view (FPV) screen to help compose the shots

3. Always make sure the camera settings are correct

Coming from a sales background, Davies turned to his photographer wife, Lyndsey Hughes, for creative tips as he began to hone his new-found skill. 

'I've never been in the creative side of the industry I've always been from a technical and support background and a sales guys by trade,' he said.

'So getting a passion for seeing a lot of different views of things has helped - it gives you inspiration to try to do other things than just being a sales guy.'

Davies discovered that using the equipment was relatively uncomplicated. 

'I put the GoPro on a timer and it shoots every five seconds so I just estimate the time and out that into a composition and take the shot,' he said.

'Then I'll wait five seconds before bringing it back to look at them and see if I've got the right shot and if not - I'll go back up again.'

The first person view screen that Davies uses when he sends up the drone helps with his accuracy of the photos he is looking to capture.

'More often than not I'll get the shot the first time rather than just wait there and my wife has helped me out with lighting and that type of thing,' he said.

The restrictions on using drones in the public domain is reviewed every year and Davies managed to capture a great shot of NRL match on Anzac day at the Sydney Cricket Ground (above) last year before it is now prohibited to take footage of major sporting events

'I put the GoPro on a timer and it shoots every five seconds so I just estimate the time and out that into a composition and take the shot, he said,' Davies said (above, Clovelly)

A resident of leafy Woollahra in Sydney's exclusive eastern suburbs, Davies regularly throws his equipment in his backpack and heads down to the city's eastern beaches to capture stunning coastal scenes - particularly at the world famous Bondi beach.

He has also taken mesmerising different perspectives of Jervis Bay, Hyams beach and Kiama in southern New South Wales as well as Cronulla - just south of Sydney - and Port Stephens on the north coast.

Davies has also had fun experimenting with his new much-loved toy in the United States, Canada and New Zealand.

His future projects include Hawaii in a few months and also far flung places throughout Australia including Broken Hill and the Simpson Desert.

'I want to capture places where people most often don't often go to like in the centre of Australia and up north,' he said.

'We want to get out to place we have been to before but never had the technology to take the high shots.'

'I've only put a minute amount on my Instagram account but Bondi (above) when the sun is rising are pretty spectacular with the panoramic views that people don't normally see or seeing it from Ben Buckler's side instead or from the beach,' Davies said.

'The photos have to be taken in line of your sight and also can't be taken in people's private property,' he explained.

'You also can't take off within 20 metres the vicinity of people.'

 It is difficult for Davies to choose his favourite shots from hundreds of pictures he has taken over the past 12 months.

'I've only put a minute amount on my Instagram account but Bondi when the sun  is rising are pretty spectacular with the panoramic views that people don't normally see or seeing it from Ben Buckler's side instead or from the beach,' he said.

'Also, the Opera house images that are facing down when people usually only see the sails from the side usually.'

Davies had even taken his drone overseas, capturing the iconic Central Park in New York City, in the US, while travelling

His future projects include Hawaii in a few months and also far flung places throughout Australia including Broken Hill and the Simpson Desert (above, Sedona in Arizona, USA)
