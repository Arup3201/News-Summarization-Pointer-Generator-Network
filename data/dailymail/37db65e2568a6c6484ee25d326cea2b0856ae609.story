Adrian Rose, 36, made contact with the girl and arranged to meet up with her before having sex

A Royal Military Police sergeant who had sex with a 12-year-old girl after befriending her on his mobile phone is facing prison.

Adrian Rose found the girl through the BlackBerry Messenger network popular with youngsters, posed as a 19-year-old, and then drove to her home city of Norwich to have sex with her.

The 36-year-old, of Aldershot, Hampshire, arranged to meet up with her and drove up from his barracks to have sex with her.

The army sergeant denied seven counts of rape, six charges of abducting the girl and meeting a child following sexual grooming.

The trial heard how the relationship was discovered when police saw Rose with the girl in a parked car at a Norwich business park last February.

Prosecutor Clare Matthews told the jury that officers noticed the girl's trousers were unzipped and there were condoms in the car.

When challenged, Rose told police: 'As if I would do anything with a 16-year-old'.

Police took the girl home and found that her mother was completely unaware she had met up with Rose and thought she had been with friends her own age

Rose's DNA was later found on the girl's bra.

Miss Matthews said the girl admitted to police that she had sex with Rose on several occasions including a hotel after meeting him through BlackBerry messaging.

Police discovered the pair in a parked car in Broadland Business Park with the girl' trousers unzipped

She said he told her he was 19 and paid her compliments and made her feel special.

The girl added that Rose 'made it all sound cool'.

Rose denied having sex with the girl or knowing that she was 12. In a statement he said he was shocked to be arrested and was unaware of her age.

But the prosecution claimed he did know her real age and that she was at school

BlackBerry Messenger allows instant messaging between BlackBerry users by using a unique PIN for their devices.

Messages are sent over the internet, and can be sent to just one person or through chat groups.

People can swap PIN numbers so that they can message each other.

There is no charge, it is similar to sending emails.

The service was blamed for allowing rioters to communicate with each other and co-ordinate groups during the UK riots in 2011 .

A jury took less than two hours to find him guilty of all the charges at Norwich Crown Court. He is due to be sentenced on February 1 after reports.

Rose was charged with rape as the girl was unable to give consent due to her age. He faced abduction charges as he did not have the permission of her parent or guardian to take her away.

Judge Stephen Holt commended the two officers who discovered Rose with the girl for a 'brilliant piece of good old fashioned policing'.

He said their actions had potentially prevented more children from being 'damaged' by Rose.

Detective Constable Steve Graves of Norfolk Police said: 'The victim in this case is a very shattered young girl, but she is determined to get on with her life.

'Rose is a predator who has denied his actions throughout, which meant the girl had to relive the traumatic events which have happened to her in order to bring him to justice.'
