She has written the women's manifesto for success in the boardroom.

Now Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg is giving relationship advice so couples can also triumph in the bedroom.

In an ongoing series for the New York Times called Women at Work, the social media executive, 45, has suggested engaging in 'choreplay' leads to more sex. 

Facebook's Chief Operating Officer and mother-of-two Sheryl Sandberg (left and right) believes sharing chores, or 'choreplay', leads to more sex 

This doesn't include romantic evenings out or luxury holidays - but simply sharing the duties around the house. 

The basis of the argument is from a 2009 study by Constance T. Gager and Scott T. Yabiku, which measured The Relationship Between Household Labor Time and Sexual Frequency.

Using the results, Sandberg and co-writer Adam Grany suggest: 'Men and women who work hard [together] play hard.'

Sandberg suggested that if if a man wanted to do something nice - instead of buying flowers they should do the laundry. 

The piece continues by saying: 'A man who heard this was asked by his wife one night to do a load of laundry. He picked up the basket and asked hopefully, 'Is this Lean In (reffering to her latest book) laundry?' Choreplay is real.' 

Citing research from 2000, the pair add 'that when men do their share of chores, their partners are happier and less depressed, conflicts are fewer, and divorce rates are lower.'

They also suggest children who spend more time being cared for by their fathers are happier, healthier and less likely to have behavioral problems.

For men, being in the company of their young ones make them more patient, emphatic and less likely to drink or do drugs. 

In 2012 mother-of-two Sandberg was made Facebook's first female board member. 

The 45-year-old, citing results of a study based on The Relationship Between Household Labor Time and Sexual Frequency, says: 'Men and women who work hard [together] play hard' (file picture)
