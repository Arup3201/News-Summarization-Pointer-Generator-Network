Britain was on flood watch today as forecasters warned the country could be facing one of its wettest winters ever.

Five flood warnings - including one for the River Clyst near Exeter, Devon, and four for the Tayside area of central Scotland - are in place for the UK, as well as 15 flood alerts.

In a three-month forecast for the winter period the Met Office has said the outlook ‘suggests an increased risk of milder and wetter than average conditions’.

Last winter was the wettest on record, with the average rainfall for winter reaching about eight inches greater than the usual for the time of year.

Most of the country woke up to dull and dreary conditions today, with heavy rainfall especially across the South-West of England and parts of Wales.

In the South-West of England rainfall is not expected to be as high as the end of last week but river levels will be sensitive to further rainfall, the Environment Agency said.

Met Office forecaster Laura Corrigan said: ‘The rain will ease and fragment for most places as we move through the day, but it will be quite persistent in north-east Scotland.

‘There is also a chance of windspeeds in the north-east of England and up into Scotland reaching between 35 and 40mph.’

Later this evening the eastern and southern coasts are likely to see ‘a few showers’, she added.

Clear, bright spells for the west and north-west of the UK will see fog patches develop and there are risks of temperatures dipping to freezing tonight.

A Met Office severe weather warning for rain in north-east Scotland earlier today has since been lifted, and there were no further alerts in place for anywhere this week.

But just before 11am today, there were delays being reported on almost a dozen train routes - including London-Peterborough, Leeds-York, Gillingham-Rochester in Kent, and Southampton-Eastleigh.

Last week many parts of the UK had to deal with the fall-out of heavy rainfall, with residents in Somerset Levels seeing increased river levels. Meanwhile many in Northern Ireland faced road closures due to downpours.

And commuters in Friday’s rush hour were caught in tailbacks after a 1ft-deep pothole formed on the M25 when heavy rain prevented concrete repairs setting.

The Met Office forecast for the next five days says it will be wet and windy in north-east Scotland, but rain will ease elsewhere and it could be sunny in places.

While Met Office experts suggest that more unsettled conditions are typical for autumn, its outlook for November to January says 'spells of wet and windy weather may be more frequent than is typical'.

Last year's winter was the wettest on record, with the UK hit by 486.8mm (19.2in) of rain between December and February, narrowly above the previous record of 485.1mm (19.1in) set in 1995.

Temperatures are likely to be milder than average for the first part of the outlook, although colder weather is predicted for January, with the outlook adding: 'The risk of occasional colder outbreaks increases later in the period'.

Researchers have suggested that the jet stream, which carries weather systems to the UK from across the Atlantic has become stronger, bringing sea temperatures and windspeeds which could lead to a particularly wet winter.
