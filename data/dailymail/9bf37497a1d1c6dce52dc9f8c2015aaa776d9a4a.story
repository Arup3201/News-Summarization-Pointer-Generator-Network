Prior to the storming run that has taken Caroline Wozniacki to the semi-finals of the US Open she spoke of not wanting to be constantly associated with her former fiancé Rory McIlroy.

'I don't want to have my name stuck with him forever,' she told the New York Times. 'I'm my own person, I have my own career.'

As ever actions speak louder than words, and nothing could have shouted out that sentiment more than the form she has shown at Flushing Meadows, where she now meets the unseeded Chinese Peng Shuai. She has given herself a great chance to make a second Grand Slam final.

Andy Murray will try to join her in the last four as he took on Novak Djokovic for the first time since the Wimbledon final last year.

Back in the swing of things: Caroline Wozniacki has reached the semi-finals of the US Open

Wozniacki demolished thirteenth seed Sara Errani 6-0 6-1 in the last eight, continuing the dynamic form that has developed since the abrupt ending of her relationship, which saw her dumped in a brief phone call.

The Dane has now tired of fielding questions about that issue, declaring it irrelevant to what has been going on for the past eleven days. You can allow her a bit of disingenuousness on the matter, but the facts say otherwise.

Since the French Open, where the hurt was at its rawest, she has collected a 24-5 match record, with two of those defeats coming against her close friend Serena Williams.

The last time she was in the last four of a Major was not long after she and McIlroy began dating. The demands of keeping a romance going with two global schedules cost her a top ten place and saw her fail to get past the quarter finals of any Grand Slam after that.

Until now, with her renewed single status having had a galvanising effect. It would be wrong to portray Wozniacki as bitter about the break-up, in fact she has handled it with class and has avoided criticising her ex-partner.

'When it comes out of the blue that's like a shock, it's like someone dies right in front of you.' she said. 'The years we had together were great and unfortunately things had to end like they did.'

Williams said she had been struck by her friend's lack of rancour, revealing: 'She said, 'I could never hate him, he has been a big part of my life and even if I wanted to I couldn't hate him.'

In tennis-specific terms there has also been an unexpected dividend coming from the cancellation of her wedding.

Sealed with a kiss: Wozniacki celebrates after defeating Sara Errani 6-0, 6-1 in the quarter-finals

The nuptials were due to take place in November, and to fill that void she decided to enter the New York Marathon instead. While always among the best movers and most durable of players she has become even better in that department, aided by a slight loss of weight through a form of training that is highly unusual for tennis players, whose joints are quite stressed enough already.

Errani plays like a human backwall and her plan is always to get everything back, wear opponents down and make them run, but she was completely overwhelmed by the athleticism on the other side of the net.

The concern in Paris back in May was that the trauma of what happened with McIlroy could shatter an already ailing career, but the opposite has proved the case.

'I have proven people wrong so many times,'said Wozniacki after beating Errani.' I was told when I was younger there is no chance I will make the top 100, top 50, top 30. Every time I have proven them wrong. It's kind of nice.

'I feel confident and I feel comfortable out there. I have been playing well in these last few months. It's just nice that it's paying off here.'

Eastern promise: Wozniacki faces doubles specialist Peng Shuai in the last four at Flushing Meadows

Her best result in a Slam was reaching the final here in 2009, before making the semis in the next two years. The feeling she has now is more like it was five years ago.

'I have to say the finals in '09 feels closer than the semi-finals of 2011. It's weird. I don't know. I think just because it was such a huge experience for me and it was my first really deep run in a Grand Slam. I'm just so happy to be back in this stage and having another match out there.'

At 28 this will be a first Grand Slam singles semi-final for Peng, a renowned doubles expert, and few would bet against Wozniacki rounding off this extraordinary summer for her by making it all the way to the final.
