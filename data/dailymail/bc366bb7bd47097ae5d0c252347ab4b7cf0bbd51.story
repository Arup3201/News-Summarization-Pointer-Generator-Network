Ed Miliband said he wanted to 'change politics' by reducing the voting age  for the first time since 1969

Sixteen and 17-year-olds would get the vote under a Labour government, Ed Miliband declared yesterday.

The Labour leader announced that he wants to ‘change politics’ by reducing the voting age for the first time since 1969 so politicians ‘hear the voices of people that haven’t been heard for a long time’.

But he was quickly accused of bowing to pressure from his union paymasters by making the announcement – which comes seven months after Unite demanded Labour make votes for 16-year-olds a manifesto pledge. 

The Tories added that the plan was one more worthy of a ‘student’ politician.

It was also even denounced by one of Mr  Miliband’s own MPs as ‘utterly irrelevant’.

The Labour leader’s move comes after Scotland’s first minister Alex Salmond did a deal with the Coalition to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in next year’s independence referendum.

In his speech, Mr Miliband said politicians should listen to the ‘voices of young people demanding a job, the voices of young people who demand that we shoulder and don’t shirk our responsibilities to the environment.’

He added: ‘Let’s give a voice to these young people in our party. And let’s give a voice to these young people in our democracy, let’s give the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds and make them part of our democracy.’

The voting age in Britain was last reduced from 21 to 18 in 1969 but polls show that the public – and even most young people – do not support votes at 16.

The Labour leader's move followed in the footsteps of Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, who did a deal with the coalition to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in the independence referendum

Labour MP Tom Harris said: ‘I just think it’s utterly irrelevant. It is opposed by most people in Britain, most adults anyway. It is the kind of thing that is an obsession of a tiny minority who think this kind of stuff matters, which it does not.

‘It is exactly the kind of middle-class dinner party issue that tofu-eaters throughout the country get really excited about.’

Grant Shapps, Chairman of the Conservative Party accused Mr Miliband of bowing to union demands

Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps accused Mr Miliband of bowing to union demands.

In the past, Labour has said the matter would be one on which MPs could have a free vote in Parliament. But on 27 February this year Unite, which has given Labour more than £9million since Mr Miliband became leader, put a submission to the party’s policy review, demanding the party make a manifesto pledge to lower the voting age to 16.

The union, run by Len McCluskey, said: ‘Young people should be given a stake in the political process by lowering the voting  age to 16.’

Labour insiders believe the party will benefit from the move to vote because the 16- and 17-year-old age group are considered more likely to vote in its favour.

In August, shadow cabinet member Sadiq Khan said votes at 16 would become official party policy,  a move confirmed by Mr Miliband for the first time yesterday.

Mr Shapps said: ‘This is literally student politics from Ed Miliband.

'He’s been weak on welfare: now he wants to tinker with voting ages instead. It shows trade union bosses are buying his policies.

This year the unions demanded he politicise the classroom, with votes for youngsters who are still at school. Today he has caved in. If he’s too weak to stand up to the unions then he’s too weak to stand up for ordinary hardworking people.’

Marc Kidson, of the British Youth Council group, which manages the campaign Votes at 16, welcomed the plan as ‘an important constitutional reform... that will mean more young people participate in politics’.

Other countries where voting is permitted at 16 include Austria, Nicaragua, Brazil and Ecuador.

Labour has also abandoned its plan to cut VAT from 20 to 17.5 per cent after warnings that the move would be unaffordable. The party’s Treasury spokesman Rachel Reeves told BBC’s Newsnight the temporary cut – which had been a centrepiece in its ‘five-point plan for growth’ and would have cost £12billion – was no longer necessary because the economy is starting to recover. A party source said the VAT cut ‘won’t be in the manifesto’.

 

Yvette Cooper watches her husband Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls gives his keynote speech to delegates

Labour will today promise to make identity theft a specific criminal offence, in a bid to stem the tide of online crime.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper will tell the Labour Party conference that police are  struggling to cope with net fraud.

The British Retail Consortium  estimates that online crime in  the retail sector alone costs £200million a year.

Although
 fraudsters can at present be convicted of a series  of crimes, a Labour
 source  yesterday that said  the lack of  an offence specifically 
relating  to identity theft ‘leads to some confusion about how to arrest
 or charge people’.

Miss 
Cooper will say: ‘We live our lives online now – but criminals know that
 too. It’s a big risk  for business. And it’s a big cost for all of us.

‘When the credit card companies and banks write off fraud we all lose out from higher charges.

‘The problem is escalating by  the day.

‘The
 police can’t do this alone. They don’t stand a chance. We need changes 
in the law to make it easier to prosecute identity theft.’

Labour would also set up a  new quango, Fraudwatch, to co-ordinate action against online criminals.
