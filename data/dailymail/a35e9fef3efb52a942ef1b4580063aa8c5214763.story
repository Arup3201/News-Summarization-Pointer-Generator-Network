'We’ve talked during the process of this,' Hernandez said in an interview with the Boston Herald. 

'As mother to mother, I’m very sorry. I don’t know what happened but I’m very sorry for all this.'

The interview comes just days after he son was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on after he was convicted of Lloyd's killing.

'I’m just sad for everybody involved,' said Hernandez. 

Ursula Lloyd refused to comment on Hernandez's interview, saying she had said all she would say about her son's death when she spoke at the courthouse earlier this week and stated that while she was hurt and heartbroken, she forgave everyone involved.

Hernandez also seems ready to move on now, saying the two year wait since her son was first charged has been the difficult part.

As for how her son is doing, Hernandez said she did not know.
