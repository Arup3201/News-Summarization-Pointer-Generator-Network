Police in Florida have released the 
desperate 911 call of a woman set on fire by her former boyfriend 
outside a gas station on Monday.

Heard screaming on tape, Naomie 
Breton, 40, the mother of her alleged attacker's child, cries: 'He set 
me on fire! OK! On fire!' to police in Boynton Beach, Florida, according to NBC Miami.

Found with severe wounds to her face 
and body, Ms Breton could be earlier seen on surveillance footage chased
with a long-knife after frantically running to extinguish the flames.

'He's still outside,' Ms Breton tells police once inside the convenience store. 'He has a knife. He set me on fire...'

'Hurry up! Please, please, please. I'm burned,'  she says.

Hiding in the bushes, police arrested 52-year-old Roosevelt
Mondesir who had met with Ms Breton at the location to deliver their 
shared son, one of Ms Breton's three children in all, before allegedly 
attacking her.

According to The South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Ms Breton tried to file a restraining order just before the savage attack that was refused for having insufficient evidence.

Waiting: Ms Breton arrived first in her white Mercedes at around 3am on Monday to the gas station

Tricked: Roosevelt Mondesir showed up but without their son in Boynton Beach, Florida

'Police have been called to the house
on many times ... On March 26 he hit me and I hit him back and was 
arrested,' she wrote, according to Palm Beach County county records 
obtained by NBC.

The mother was waiting in her silver 
Mercedes at about 3am on Monday when Mondesir showed up in his white 
Jaguar without the boy and began hurling the fuel over her, Boynton Beach police said.

She tried to run away and headed into the store for safety, attempting to hold the door shut.

But the 52-year-old Mondesir chased her with a large knife, possibly a machete, got the door open to pull her out and then ignited her.

In
graphic surveillance video which captured the horrifying attack, a man can be seen threatening a woman with a
large knife, struggling in the doorway of the store.

'Get away from 
me!' she can be heard shouting.

Surprise attack: Mondesir can be seen running at Ms Breton and pouring gasoline over her

Terror: Ms Breton tried to run and hold the door closed but Mondesir chased after her with a knife, which can be seen in his hand in the doorway

They disappear from view until she returns in a massive fireball, screaming and running around the parking lot.

Ms Breton had moved out of the apartment she lived in with Mondesir back in March, and he had threatened her several times for months after.

Just two weeks before the attack, Ms Breton filed a restraining order against Mondesir, which a judge denied due to a lack of evidence.

Mondesir, who fled the 7-Eleven on foot, was found by police officers about three hours after the incident in nearby bushes.

Cops had also raided his home, where they found their 4-year-old son asleep after he had been left there alone.

Mondesir was treated for burns at 
Bethesda Hospital in Boynton Beach before being transferred to jail. He
has been charged with attempted first-degree murder.

Flaming: The pair disappear from view for a moment before the woman runs back across the shot, a human fireball

Horrific: Ms Breton is last seen running around in front of the store, still on fire. She survived the attack

Vendetta: On his Facebook page Roosevelt Mondesir lists himself as an engaged truck driver

On his Facebook page Mondesir has himself listed as 'engaged' and his employment as a truck driver. He lists his interests as classical music, ESPN and the British comedy series My Family.

One of Roosevelt's neighbor in a subdivision of Lake Worth told CBS 12 that she was shocked upon learning about the attack.

'I'm stunned. He's not that kind of person.'

In February he was accused of threatening the victim and destroying her furniture, the CBS affiliate reported.

In March they were summoned again for a physical altercation. After the woman moved out of the 
home, police reports say she received text messages including one that 
read 'I'm all about revenge.'

It was not known if Mondesir had yet obtained an attorney.

Ms Breton is expected to survive. She was being treated at Delray Medical Center.
