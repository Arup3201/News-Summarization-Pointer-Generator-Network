FA chairman Greg Dyke will continue on the attack over his homegrown players campaign by taking the controversial issue to the FA council next week.

Dyke will be giving the presentation to councillors that he was unable to make at last week’s Premier League meeting. He is looking for big support from the chamber in his battle with the PL to increase homegrown numbers from eight to 12 players in top-flight squads.

Dyke has also been in combative mood with two other opponents — Wales and FIFA president Sepp Blatter.

The FA chairman wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs from eight to 12

Speaking at the official Wembley function before the Lithuania game, Dyke described them as a small footballing nation who he hoped would not cause as many problems as another ‘small footballing nation . . . Wales’ had been doing.

This was a reference to Wales opposing a Team GB football side at the Olympics, David Gill’s right to the British vice-presidency on the FIFA executive and the arrogant anti-FA slurs from the FA of Wales’s loose cannon president Trefor Lloyd-Hughes.

Blatter also said that Gill’s main target in Zurich should be the ‘little bald chap sitting at the other end of the table’.

Dyke was also in the mood to attack his own organisation — complaining that the vase the FA always gave their Wembley visitors as a gift was not the best.

An FA spokesman said Dyke’s speech was meant to be light-hearted and the sensitive FAW did not bite for once.

lt’s hard to see how the FA, who are looking for 15 per cent cuts across the board, can justify the extra expense of booking separate hotels on away trips — one for the England team and key support staff and another for the rest of the FA entourage — especially as they stay in the same accommodation when in England. 

The twin booking was brought in after the World Cup where manager Roy Hodgson  felt the presence of the FA’s huge travelling party was a distraction on match days.

However, the post-World Cup promise the FA made that England would spent most of their time preparing for matches at £120million St George’s Park in the Staffordshire countryside has not materialised. The Grove Hotel outside Watford is still utilised more often because of its proximity to London.

RFU silent on Jevans

The RFU’s continued refusal to discuss the shock departure of England Rugby 2015 chief executive Debbie Jevans — chairman Andy Cosslett claimed the statement that she resigned for unexplained personal reasons ‘says it all’ — will only lead to speculation that does no party any good whatsoever.

No jobs were being advertised on the ER 2015 website on Monday, which supports the theory that staff numbers and expenses had been spiralling out of control — as does Jevans’s alleged huge use of Addison Lee taxis. But an ER2015 spokeswoman claimed there will be more job opportunities posted this week.

One of Jevans’s first acts on arrival in 2012 was to select the England ball at the World Cup draw when Boris Johnson and his advisers had expected him to do so. And England ending up in the ‘group of death’ with Wales and Australia could still come back to haunt everyone concerned.

Mark Pougatch, in his new role as ITV’s lead football presenter, travelled to Turin on Monday in BA business class alongside pundits Glenn Hoddle, Lee Dixon and Ian Wright. But at least he gave his sometime BBC 5 Live colleagues cramped at the back in economy a wave on arrival in Italy.

Barclays opting out of renewing their title sponsorship of the Premier League after next season has given top-flight clubs more flexibility signing their own bank partners. Manchester City are in negotiation with Citibank.

Fabian Delph, England’s midfield enforcer, has his feet on the ground. He admirably described his mother Donna as a ‘hero’ and a ‘great role model’ for the way she always tried to do the best for him while bringing him up in difficult circumstances.
