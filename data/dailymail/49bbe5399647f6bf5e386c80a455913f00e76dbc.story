Danniella Westbrook today sobbed as she described how she was subjected to a horrific 48-hour sex attack by a violent drug gang.

Speaking with Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on This Morning the former EastEnders star told how the attack, which took place at the height of her drug addiction in 1994, has scarred her forever.

Danniella, who owed the gang thousands of pounds after they supplied her with cocaine, was taken captive in a ground floor flat for two days where the gang gave her alcohol and drugs before the multiple rapes took place.

Gangraped: Danniella Westbrook spoke of the terrifying ordeal she suffered at the hands of a violent drug gang at the height of her fame

By that stage, Danniella had left 
EastEnders and had split up with her boyfriend, a boyband member.

'It was a terrible time,' she confesses.

'I was really heavily into drugs and moved away 
from everybody where I grew up and moved to South London.

'I had a few different people that I used to get drugs from and obviously being on TV everybody thinks you're really rich,' she said.

'I'd used that as a drug addict to my
advantage.'

But Danniella spiralled into debts of £5,000 with one supplier and could not find the money to pay him back.

When she opened her front door to find his henchmen waiting to collect the debt, she says she knew she was in grave danger.

'One of the guys I owed the money to sent their people to get
the money. I just knew the moment I open the front door 
and there were these three guys standing there...'

Danniella says she assumed the 
gang was going to drive her somewhere and beat her up - and says she wishes that had been the case.

'When it was clear that I didn't have
the money, they said "get ready, you're coming with us".

'I thought I
was going to get taken somewhere and get beaten up and dumped. I 
wished it had been that."'

Captive: The gang of three men took her from her home to a rented flat where they gave her alcohol and Rohypnol before taking in in turns to rape her repeatedly

With three men as her kidnappers Danniella says there was no point in resisting.

'I knew if I shouted out 
it was going to make it worse. These people are not scared of the 
police or anyone else. They are there to do what they've got to do.

'They took me to a rented flat and gave me vodka and drugs - then what I 
thought was ecstasy but it was Rohypnol.

'I was there for nearly three
days. It was a case of them raping me and doing what they wanted to do
with me.

'That was the start of my nightmare.'

After the gang released Danniella, she says she returned home - but didn't report the attack.

'I
just went home and thought "I'm a drug addict. If I tell anybody 
they'll just say it was what I deserved".

'I blocked everything from 
that day out. I felt pretty worthless anyway being a drug addict but 
from then on my life just got worse. I just had this secret that I 
didn't want to tell anyone.'

Danniella says that talking about the
attack in recent times after keeping it to herself for so long has been incredibly 
hard - but has helped her to move on.

'It was just a difficult time in my life,' she says.

Trauma: The incident occurred back in the 90s when she was at the height of her career in EastEnders

'It's hard to talk about because I hadn't spoken to anyone about it until writing the book.

I'd only spoken to my therapist 
briefly about it... but to explain certain subjects, I knew I had to 
speak about it. And in doing so had to tell my husband and my mum.'

'Telling my husband was really really difficult - he's the closest person to me in the world and always has been - and I just thought that this fantastic man who has gone through every single drama that I'd had in my life would never wanted to be with me and it actually wasn't like that.'

Now that she has managed to tell those closest to her, Danniella urges others who have been victim of rape to speak out too.

'I can't stress enough that if anybody had been in this situation then get help and speak out. You can't live with this... it will kill you.'

Danniella, a born again Christian, says that finding faith has helped her through the agony of the attack.

'It worked for me,' she says. 'My faith is something that I have personally. It's not my husband's, it's not my children's, it's mine. And it does see me through a lot.'

'I personally have a relationship with God - I feel like I'm his daughter and I feel worth something. And I didn't have that ever in my life.'

Talking about being clean of drugs now for twelve years, Daniella said: 'This is all behind me now and this is the last bit of my demons.

'Everything is now out in the open... and that's a huge sense of clarity.'

But she admits that she will always suffer from the lure of addiction.

'I do think once an addict, always an addict - and if its not drugs it'll be something else. Especially having bipolar disorder as well.

'It's never easy. I think you just have to watch yourself all the time because one addiction can easily fall into another.

'I have watch myself and I have to be honest.'To see the interview in full visit the This Morning website.
