Walked free: Karen Ackland, 44, had sex with her friend's 14-year-old son at a family party - but has been handed a suspended sentence

A mother whose friend had sex with her 14-year-old son at a family party has slammed a judge for letting her walk free from court. 

The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was sickened to discover Karen Ackland, 44, had taken advantage of her son - who is 30 years her junior.

Divorced mother-of-two Ackland was at a party when she met the schoolboy.

After hours of drinking the boy's mother offered Ackland a bed at their home.

Ackland, the mother of two teenagers, pounced on the boy as he got ready for bed and used him as her 'sex object' - until the boy's older brother heard noises and caught her in the act. 

She was handed a nine-month jail term, suspended for a year, after admitting three charges of sexual activity with a child.

Unleashing a scathing attack on the sentence, the child's mother said: 'If she had been a man I think she would have had a jail sentence.

'When my son was interviewed I was welling up. He looked exhausted, he was emotionally drained.

'It was absolutely harrowing to hear.

'Women should have as long sentences as men. It's exactly the same sexual act.' 

The peroxide-blonde was also heard to say 'I can't believe I'm doing this with a 15 year old!' 

Canterbury Crown Court heard the boy, who is now 16, was just 14 years old at the time.

Ackland, of Kent, quickly changed her plea to guilty just before the victim was due to give evidence.

Judge Simon James said Ackland had 'immediately regretted' her behaviour and although committed in drink he said 'that does not afford you any real excuses'.

He added that the law was to protect teenagers from doing things which they may later regret.

The youngster's distraught mother yesterday called for harsher sentences for female sex offenders.

She said: 'I never expected her to do this, you trust your friends. And he was just a child.

'She was always a party animal and when she had too many drinks she completely loses all self-respect and embarrasses herself.

'She used to always say 'I'm a nightmare when I've had a drink' and she'd always have a few men on the go.

'But I was a great friend to her and I stood by her. I never expected this. 

'She was very domineering and my son said as soon as it happened that he'd wished he'd never done it.'

Enraged: The mother of the boy slammed the judge at Canterbury Crown Court calling for a tougher sentence

Ackland first set eyes on her young victim at the event on April 27 last year.

The group first went back to Ackland's house where Andrew Espley, prosecuting, said 'everyone did three shots of Vodka'.

Ackland then backed the helpless boy into a corner in the kitchen and they kissed. 

She tried to get the boy to walk her home on the pretext she had lost her phone, but his older brother refused to let him go.

But as the boy went upstairs to get some tracksuit bottoms so he could changed for bed, Ackland sneaked into the room behind him. 

Mr Espley said: 'During this she was moaning and at one point asked him to spit into her mouth.

'What she did caused them to be discovered.

'Pounced': The court heard Ackland, mother of two teenagers, cornered the boy and used him for sex

'She was drunk at the time and used the teenager as a sexual object.'

After the boy's brother burst into the room, Ackland ran out the family's home and kept what she had done from the his mother.

The boy later told a friend: 'I went to get into my trackies and she stripped naked in front of me.

'Yeah we had sex but it was really weird.'

Mr Espley said within days the incident was the talk of the school and teachers were forced to report the incident to police.

Ackland told a friend: 'He tried to kiss me. I'm a 40-year-old woman what am I supposed to do?'

Domini Webber, defending, said the Tesco shelf-stacker grew up in Germany as the daughter of a father who was in the military.

She married in 1993 but is now divorced with two teenage children.

Mr Webber said: 'She accepts that this was extremely irresponsible behaviour and she admits to being a binge drinker.'

Ackland was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register and pay £500 court costs.

Director of children's charity Kidscape Claude Knights yesterday said the sentence 'sends out a very weak message'.

She said: 'The suspended nine-month custodial sentence does not reflect the severity of this crime and sends out a very weak message.

'Despite many advances in our understanding the true extent of female sexual abuse remains a hidden picture. One has to ask how this crime would have been perceived had it been committed by a man.

'The response to such despicable crimes against children should be very robust regardless of the gender of the perpetrator.'
