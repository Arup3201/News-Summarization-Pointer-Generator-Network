An on-air dispute between two shock jocks in Tampa has spilled over to the courts.

Todd Schnitt known as MJ Kelli and his wife Michelle are suing Bubba the Love Sponge Clem for defamation after comments he made on-air. 

The problem began after Clem returned to the Tampa Bay radio market in January 2008 after a hiatus sparking a radio war.

Court: Todd Schnitt known as MJ Kelli and his wife Michelle are suing Bubba the Love Sponge Clem for defamation after comments he made on-air

Schnitt and his wife are suing Clem, claiming he made 'false, highly 
offensive and defamatory' statements about them.

Incidents include when Clem called former Assistant State Attorney Michelle Schnitt, who often appeared on her husband's show, a 'whore,' reported the Tampa Bay Times.

The spate began when Clem accused Schnitt of accepting favours and gifts from businesses in exchange for plugs on the air.

He then accused Mrs Schnitt of conspiring with State Attorney Mark Ober to bring animal cruelty charges against him after in 20001 after he presided over the slaughter and barbecue of a wild boar on-air.

Although Clem was later acquitted of animal cruelty, he vowed revenge against the Schnitts for being prosecuted.

On Wednesday, Clem said the accusations and name-calling were all just an act and that he only the attacked the Schnitt's alter ego, MJ Kelli.

The campaign, Clem's attorney, Joseph Diaco, told jurors, 'was juvenile, offensive, maybe even disgusting, but wasn't personal.'

He was backed up by Brent Hatley, a 'Bubba' executive 
producer and cast member, who said:

'MJ Kelli is not a real person,' he said. 'It's a character. Just like Arnold Schwarzenegger is not the terminator.'

In the suit, the Schnitts claim Clem took a battle for ratings too 
far, encouraging his fans, known as Bubba's Army, to target 
the Schnitts, reported the Tampa Bay Online

In his evidence Schnitt said that since the radio war had began he started to experience hassle on the streets of Tampa.

friend Bubba The Love Sponge

He told how he was with his children at WestShore Plaza in 2008 when a man walked up to him in the food court and yelled obscene comments and how a similar incident happened later at a restaurant.

He said that eggs were thrown at his house with a note reading 'Bubba army Rulesssssss!!!!!!'

On tapes heard by the jurors the voice of Bubba the Love Sponge said 'Fight back. … Be a man. I'm calling your wife a whore.'

When discussing why Mrs  Schnitt was called a whore, Clem's former co-host Matt 'Spiceboy' Loyd said it was 'just a general term to try to stir it up' and was not to accuse her of being promiscuous or a prostitute.

The past few months have been difficult for Clem as in October Hulk Hogan settled his lawsuit against  him.

The wrestler has dropped charges against his former best friend over his leaked sex tape, but is still suing Bubba's ex-wife Heather Clem - who stars in the saucy video alongside Hulk - and website host Gawker Media for allegedly violating his privacy

The trial continues.
