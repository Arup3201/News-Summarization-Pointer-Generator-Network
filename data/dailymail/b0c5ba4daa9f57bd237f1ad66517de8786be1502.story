There's the Empire State Building, the World Trade Center site and Times Square.

Now many visitors to New York City have added another spot to their list of must-sees - the Occupy Wall Street protest. And they're making the most of the demonstration merchandise on offer.

Tourists from around the world have become regular visitors at the plaza in lower Manhattan where protesters have been demonstrating for the past month.

Popular attraction: The Occupy Wall Street protest in Zuccotti Park in New York's financial district has been visited by tourists from around the world over the last month

On any given day, visitors can be seen taking photographs of themselves at Zuccotti Park with protesters in the background.

The double-decker buses offering 
tours of Manhattan pass by on Broadway, with guides pointing out the 
park site. On sunny days, tourists often wave sympathetically at 
protesters from the top decks of the buses.

On
a typical day, tourists clog up the area, which is often bustling with 
financial district employees pushing their way through.

One
visitor, Jackie Qualizza of Bucyrus, Kansas, challenged protester Art 
Udeykin by asking him to explain the purpose of the demonstration, which
has inspired similar activism in many cities across the U.S. and around
the world.

Sourvenirs: Like any tourist attraction, there are a lot of badges and other logos that can be worn

Mr Udeykin, 23, from Iowa, said: 
'Right now, we don't have a goal - except to back away from the system 
that's not working. This is a way to feel free, to feel normal.'

Art Udeykin, protester

Mrs
Qualizza said she couldn't see herself demonstrating, but added, 'I 
don't disagree with them. The government bailed out everyone, and things
are still not working. Something has to change.'

The protest against corporate 
influence in governments and wealth inequality has many of the things 
tourists look for, including photo-worthy moments and even some 
trinkets.

In this case, the T-shirts and buttons offered by protesters are generally free, although they accept donations.

Message: The encampment in the financial district of New York City is now in its second month

Visitors do get a show at times. Shawn Lahey, from Poughkeepsie, New York, watched a dancing man holding a pole marked 'corporation', attached to a noose marked 'financial system' - from which another dancing man was 'hanging'. Masked drummers provided a thumping soundtrack.

'I think it's great - they're trying to 
make a point. I don't think it'll make any difference. The government 
won't make any changes, because it's all about money'

Mr Lahey said: 'I think it's great - they're trying to make a point. I don't think it'll make any difference. The government won't make any changes, because it's all about money.'

Molly Schwad, from Kansas, said she was surprised by what she saw, compared to the television coverage of the protest movement.

She saw a rather quiet encampment in the rain, of only about 200 people.

At times several hundred people have 
camped at the park, and some of the demonstrations organized as part of 
the Occupy Wall Street movement have drawn thousands.

'I thought it was much bigger. We were afraid there might be violence here'

'I thought it was much bigger,' Mrs Schwad said. 'We were afraid there might be violence here.'

Some nearby businesses are far less enamored of the protesters, and say the hubbub outside their doors is costing them money.

Stacey
Tzortzatos, manager of Panini & Co., a restaurant that's normally 
bustling as it serves financial district clients, said the eatery has 
been losing business because police barricades discourage customers from
coming in, and media vans are blocking the view.

But the biggest problem, she said, 
was protesters coming in to use the bathroom - '30 at a time.' She said 
she put locks on the bathroom doors in response.

'They take showers using the sink, they brush their teeth, and they make a huge mess'

Stacey Tzortzatos, local business manager

'They take showers using the sink, they brush their teeth, and they make a huge mess,' she said.

Ms Tzortzatos said she's been harassed and verbally abused by protesters, who have come in eating donated food.

'I
was called "evil" for asking whether they were customers, when they 
came in eating their free pizza, smelling so bad,' she said. 'It's a 
constant battle, and it's getting worse as the weeks go by.'

Other food venues didn't mind.

'As long as they buy something and don't make a mess, we're happy to have them'

Alex Gervis, local business worker

'Business is business!' said Alex Gervis, who works behind the counter at Manon, a cafe near Zuccotti Park that sells imported Italian coffee and Belgian chocolates.

He said protesters have come in 'six, or even 10, at a time. And as long as they buy something and don't make a mess, we're happy to have them.'

The only disruption came several days ago, 'when they tried to play guitar,' he said. 'We can't have that.'
