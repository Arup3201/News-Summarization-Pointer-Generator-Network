Perhaps one of the most defining features of humanity is people's capacity for empathy – the ability to put ourselves in others' shoes.

A new study has added to a growing body of scientific evidence that the human brain is not only hardwired to empathise with others, but does this so strongly that individuals cannot differentiate between what happens to a close friend or family member and themselves.

Scientists found humans are hardwired to empathise as we associate with people emotionally close to us, but are largely incapable of empathising so strongly with strangers.

A new study has added to a growing body of scientific evidence that the human brain is not only hardwired to empathise with others, but does this so strongly that individuals cannot differentiate between what happens to a close friend or family member and themselves

James Coan, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia, said: 'With familiarity, other people become part of ourselves.'

'Our self comes to include the people we 
feel close to,' he said to conclude that humans' self-identity is largely 
based on whom we know and empathise with.

To come up with this conclusion, he used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to examine the brains of 22 young adults who were made to feel 'under threat' of receiving mild electrical shocks to themselves as well as to a friend and stranger.

The researchers found, as they expected, 
that regions of the brain responsible for threat response – the anterior
insula, putamen and supramarginal gyrus – became active under threat of
shock to the self.

In the case of threat of shock to a stranger, the brain in those regions displayed little activity.

However, when the threat of shock was to a friend,
the brain activity of the participant became essentially identical to 
the activity displayed under threat to the self.

Dr Coan said: 'The correlation between self and friend was remarkably similar.'

'The finding shows the brain's remarkable 
capacity to model self to others; that people close to us become a part 
of ourselves and that is not just metaphor or poetry, it's very real.

'Literally we are under threat when a friend is under threat. But not so 
when a stranger is under threat,' he said.

Dr Coan believes the reason for this response is because humans need to have friends and allies who they can side with and see as being the same as themselves and as people spend more time together, they become more similar.

He said: 'It's essentially a breakdown of self and other; our self comes to include the people we become close to...If a friend is under threat, it becomes the same as if we ourselves are under threat.

'We can understand the pain or difficulty they may be going through in the same way we understand our own pain.'

The study found the correlation between self and friend was remarkably similar. Dr Coen said: 'People close to us become a part of ourselves...literally we are under threat when a friend is under threat. But not so when a stranger is under threat'

Dr Coan said in the study, which was published in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, this is probably the source of empathy and part of the evolutionary process.

He explained a threat to ourselves is also a threat to our resources needed to survive.

'Threats can take things away from us. But when we develop friendships, people we can trust and rely on who in essence become we, then our resources are expanded, we gain.

'Your goal becomes my goal. It's a part of our survivability,' he added.
