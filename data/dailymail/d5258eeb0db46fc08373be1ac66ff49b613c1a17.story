Photographs of seven men have been released by police investigating racist chanting at a mainline station following a Chelsea Champions League football match earlier this month.

British Transport Police (BTP) said the images were taken at St Pancras International station in London at around 8pm on February 18.

This was the day after an incident on the Paris Metro before Chelsea's match with Paris St Germain when a black man was subjected to alleged racist abuse.
