Google's chief financial officer Patrick Pichette has revealed that he is quitting his job to travel the world with his wife.

Pichette, 52, shared the decision, which he called a 'perfectly fine mid life crisis full of bliss and beauty', in a Google+ post on  Tuesday afternoon. 

'After nearly 7 years as CFO, I will be retiring from Google to spend more time with my family,' he wrote - adding that he will only be leaving the company once they find a replacement.

Canadian-born Pichette explained that the idea of retiring first came to him last September while he was watching the sunrise from the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro with his wife, Tamar.

Stepping down: Patrick Pichette, Google's chief financial officer (pictured in 2012), has announced he is retiring after nearly seven years working for the company. He plans to travel the world with his wife, he said

'And Tamar out of the blue said "Hey, why don't we just keep on going",' he wrote. '"Let's explore Africa, and then turn east to make our way to India, it's just next door, and we're here already.

'"Then, we keep going; the Himalayas, Everest, go to Bali, the Great Barrier Reef... Antarctica, let's go see Antarctica!?"'

He told her: 'It's not time yet, There is still so much to do at Google, with my career, so many people counting on me/us - Boards, Non Profits, etc,' he wrote.

'But then she asked the killer question: So when is it going to be time? Our time? My time? The questions just hung there in the cold morning African air.

'A few weeks later, I was happy back at work, but could not shake away THE question: When is it time for us to just keep going?'

He explained that this is the right time to step down, as two of their children are away at college and the third is working for a start-up in Africa.

Family: Pichette said it is time to retire because his three children are no longer living at home. He will also celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary with his wife (center) this year and said 'she deserves more'

Turning point: He first thought of retiring as he and his wife watched the sunset from Mount Kilimanjaro last year (pictured with their guides) and she said she wanted to keep traveling with him rather than go home

'Nobody is waiting for us/needing us,' he wrote.

The couple will also celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary this year. In that entire time, it has been 'non-stop work' for him. 'She deserves more,' he wrote. 'Lots more.'

Pichette explained that he would be staying with Google, where it has been a 'privilege' to work, until the company finds a replacement and he will be remain there throughout the transition. 

He concluded: 'In the end, life is wonderful, but nonetheless a series of trade offs, especially between business/professional endeavours and family/community.

'And thankfully, I feel I'm at a point in my life where I no longer have to have to make such tough choices anymore. And for that I am truly grateful. Carpe Diem.'

Pichette can afford to step down. Bloomberg Business reported that his salary is $650,000. In 2012, he was paid a $492,115 salary and a $2.7 million cash bonus, CNN Money reported. 

And in addition to his salary and bonuses, he earned in nearly $31 million from his Google stock incentives from 2010 to 2013, the Associated Press reported. 

Adventurer: Pichette, who earned $31 million from his Google stock incentives alone between 2010 and 2013, said he is no longer in the position where he has to choose between working and his family

Since Pichette joined the company in 2008, the share price has more than doubled and Google has made some of its biggest acquisitions, including Motorola's wireless business, which it bought for $9.8 billion, Bloomberg reported.

He told the company he would be retiring on March 4 and it plans to find a new CFO within the next six months, Google said in a statement.

CEO Larry Page also shared Pichette's leaving notice on his own Google+ page.

'Well worth reading -- it will warm your heart,' he wrote. 'Patrick has been a joy to work with and I wish him all the best on his new adventures!'

Pichette was born in Montreal, attended the Université du Québec à Montréal and received an MA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Oxford. He worked for Bell Canada before Google.

Property records show he lives with his wife in a $4 million, five-bedroom home in Palo Alto, California, just a few miles from Google's headquarters in Mountain View.
