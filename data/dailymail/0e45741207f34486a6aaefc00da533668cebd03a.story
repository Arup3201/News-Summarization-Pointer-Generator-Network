Andrew Lloyd Webber's driver was arrested after being caught stealing the Oscar-winning composer's housekeeping cash

Andrew Lloyd Webber's driver was arrested after being caught stealing the Oscar-winning composer's housekeeping cash.

Police were called to the theatre impresario's £15million townhouse in Belgravia, central London, on Thursday and led away his 45-year-old driver in handcuffs.

The chauffeur, who was wearing a bright purple tie and navy-blue jacket as he was taken to the police car, has now been sacked, according to Lord Lloyd-Webber's company, Really Useful Group.

He was arrested on suspicion of 'theft employee' and taken to a nearby police station where he admitted the offence and accepted a caution.

A source told The Sun that hundreds of pounds had gone missing from the composer's mansion in recent weeks.

Lord Lloyd-Webber, the theatre impresario behind musicals including Cats and Evita, is worth an estimated £640million and was ranked 162 in The Sunday Times' Rich List last year.

His annual profits were boosted by the success of his Charlie And The Chocolate Factory musical, as pre-tax profits of Really Useful Investments were raised to £6.2million  to June 2014.

The composer's revival of Cats, the musical, starring Nicole Scherzinger is set to extend its West End run with 100,000 extra tickets after 'extraordinary' demand from a new generation of fans.

He recently said of the former Pussycat Doll, 'I think she is the real deal, the absolute real deal.

'She is what you might call an American theatre babe. I do believe she is the most exciting musical theatre artist I have found – well, that I have worked with – in very, very many years. I really do.'

Lord Lloyd-Webber was recently named among a string of celebrities including David Beckham and Bob Geldof who are facing having to pay the taxman a total of £1billion in a dispute over a suspected tax avoidance scheme.

The composer told the Sunday Times he was advised that he was being 'almost philanthropic by investing in the British film industry, and that this was a scheme to promote British films', adding: 'At no time did I consider it solely a tax scheme.'

He lives in his Belgravia townhouse with his third wife, Madeleine Gurdon, a former equestrian sportswoman.

A Met Police spokesman said: 'Police were called to reports of a theft at an address in SW1 at 1.20pm on Thursday 5 February.

'A 45-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of theft employee and was taken into police custody. He was cautioned and there will not be a court appearance.'

Lord Lloyd-Webber's spokesman refused to comment.
