The heatwave persuaded more Britons to stay in the UK during the summer holidays, a survey has revealed.

The poll, conducted by tourist board VisitEngland, showed 12 per cent of people who holidayed at home had changed their original plans because of the sunshine – with 17 per cent saying the good weather had made them more inclined to choose a domestic destination next year as well.

The figures also showed that UK ‘staycations’ rose by 9 per cent in July 2013 compared to the same month in 2012, with holidaymakers spending £1.8billion.

A survey revealed more people opted for domestic destinations such as Brighton (pictured in March) for their summer holidays as a result of the heatwave

Those aged 18-34 and families were more 
likely to have changed their plans because of the weather and over half 
of all holidaymakers (56 per cent) in England enjoyed good weather.

Seventeen per cent said they were more likely to take a holiday in England next year because of the weather in 2013.

Tourism minister Helen Grant said: ‘The domestic tourism sector has a big role to play in helping with the economic recovery so I am delighted that visits are up.’

'England has such a diverse offer for 
holidays at home - from tranquil countryside and coastal towns to 
vibrant cities - and I will do all I can to help the industry continue 
to grow.'

James Berresford, from VisitEngland, said: ‘Clearly the 588 hours of sunshine this year has been a boost for domestic tourism.

'Operators have reported increased visitor numbers this year and are seeing positive forward bookings for autumn,

'With the 450th anniversary of the birth of Shakespeare, the Tour de France setting off from Yorkshire, as well as a whole host of exciting events, new attractions and hotel openings, I'm confident that the trend to holiday at home will go from strength to strength.

The figures were based on a survey of more than 1,000 Britons about their attitudes towards taking a break at home.
