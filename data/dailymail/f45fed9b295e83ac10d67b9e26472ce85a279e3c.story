It wouldn't be Christmas party season without a sparkly dress collection from Gemma Collins.

The TOWIE star-turned-fashion-designer, who embraces her 
curves and acts as a mouthpiece for plus-size women everywhere, has 
launched a capsule collection from her very own Gemma Collins range.

Gemma has added a Christmas edit to her eponymous plus-size clothing line and she hopes it will give curvy women confidence this December.

Putting on the glitz: Gemma Collins, who found fame on TOWIE, has unveiled a new Christmas collection (Miami Red, £75)

The 32-year-old has created a range offering seasonal shades of deep greens, wine reds and festive metallics.

Speaking about her new line, Gemma said: 'What better time to put on those party shoes and get glam than Christmas; the most magical time of the year?

'I’m so excited about launching my capsule collection in time for the festive season.

'From waist-cinching wrap dresses to pull in those curves to figure-skimming shift dresses; gold-studded numbers to sassy sequin frocks, there really is something for ever plus-size party girl hoping for a kiss under the mistletoe this Christmas.

Golden girl: Gemma hopes that her new range will give curvy women confidence to steal a kiss under the mistletoe this December

'My Christmas capsule collection will make any curvy girl feel a million dollars.'

Speaking about her motives behind the new collection, Gemma candidly told MailOnline: 'As a bigger girl I’ve always felt forced
 into wearing black because there’s nothing else available on the 
high-street.

'I’m on a mission to bring sexy back for us curvy girls this
 Christmas with a capsule collection bursting with seasonal colour and 
bling.

Flattering: Gemma told MailOnline that she was inspired to launch her range after she became fed up of wearing solely black clothes over the party season

Feel good fashion: 'My Christmas capsule collection will make any curvy girl feel a million dollars,' promises Gemma

'I’ve introduced mulled wine reds, deep greens and metallics 
meaning there’s no excuse for any plus-size lady out there to be hiding 
behind her little black dress this festive season.

'Christmas is 
the perfect time to celebrate our curves and show off the gorgeous body 
we have been given. I hope my Christmas Capsule Collection will allow 
the inner confidence of every one of us larger girls to shine through.'

Since its launch in July 2012, Gemma Collins’ Collection has gone from strength to strength and she scooped the Best Designer at the Plus-size Fashion Awards last month.
