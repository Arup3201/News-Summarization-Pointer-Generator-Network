A voter standing beside President Barack Obama as he was casting his early ballot for the 2014 midterm elections in Chicago warned the Commander-in-Chief: 'Don't touch my girlfriend'. 

Mike Jones was waiting in line with his girlfriend Aia Cooper when President Obama arrived at the poling station in Chicago. 

A nervous Jones said: 'I know you're Mr President, but don't touch my girlfriend.'

Joke: Mike Jones was caught on camera poking fun at the President as he voted alongside Jones' girlfriend Aia Cooper in Chicago

Last laugh: The President made fun of Mike Jones to his girlfriend Aia Cooper at the polling booth and told a delighted Ms Cooper her boyfriend was 'embarrassing'

'Fool': Obama jokes and references himself as he teases Mike Jones' girlfriend Aia saying he was lucky 'the President was nice' about his heckling

Cooper later told CBS Chicago: 'I didn’t know what to say. I was just shaking. I said ‘"Oh boy, this is the president. What am I supposed to do?".'

President Obama commented on the encounter: 'There’s an example of a brother just embarrassing me for no reason, just for no reason whatsoever.'

Jones said: 'It was so silent in there and everyone was just taking pictures I figured I had to say something to make people laugh.'

President Obama told Cooper what she might tell her family and friends about the day she met the President: 'I can’t believe Mike, he is such a fool.

'But fortunately, the president was nice about it, so it’s alright,' he added. 

Outside the poling station Cooper told WLS-TV that she received a hug and a kiss from the President: 'On the cheek, just the cheek — please, Michelle, don’t come after me — just the cheek!'

They said they had no idea before turning up that President Obama would be there. He was voting early himself to encourage a higher turnout among the electorate. 

The couple have been interviewed on multiple broadcasts since the jokey exchange including on CNN and on CBS Chicago. 

President Barack Obama cast his vote early for the 2014 midterm elections in a bid to get voters to go to the polls  ahead of election day.

The president voted in a community center in Chicago - named after the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., - near his family's home on Chicago's South Side.

'The most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen,' the president told reporters at the Center, as he took advantage of the first day of early voting in Illinois.

'I’m so glad I can early vote. It’s so exciting. I love voting,' the president said, in a not-so-subtle way. 

Adding: 'Everybody in Illinois [should] vote early. It’s a wonderful opportunity.' 

Before he was handed his ballot, a poll worker asked if he was Barack Obama, according to Politico.

'That’s me,' he said. 

Jealous now? Obama taunted his heckler back by giving his delighted girlfriend a kiss on the cheek

Hot water! Aia Cooper rolled her eyes outside the polling booth after her boyfriend Mike Jones teased the president - before adding to Michelle that she and Barack only shared a peck

Overnight stardom: The couple were interviewed following the jokey exchange with the President 

However, his gesture was widely seen as being symbolic as he explained that the most 'important job in a democracy is the job of citizen.'

Obama also delivered doughnuts and pastries to Democratic campaign volunteers in Chicago to boost moral on Monday.

He carried  the boxes of pastries into a Pat Quinn campaign office as Governor Pat Quinn and Senator Dick Durbin stood alongside him.

'The way we win any election is making sure we turn out,' he told the room full of volunteers.

And on Sunday night, the president did not shy away from saying exactly who he was likely to cast his vote for at a rally for Illinois Governor Pat Quinn. The governor is running for re-election in Obama's home state.

A fired up Obama told a crowd at Chicago State University, that he would vote early for Quinn and Sen. Dick Durbin.

'The first thing I'm gonna do tomorrow is cast my vote to re-elect Dick Durbin and give my friend Pat Quinn four more years as governor of the great state of Illinois,' Obama said.

Obama described Durbin as a mentor who took him under his wing when he first became a senator in 2005.

He said: 'Durbin helped make sure that I didn't get into too much trouble.' 

However, another stop made by the president on the campaign trail Sunday was marred by a steady stream of crowd members leaving early and even a yelling heckler.

The president was at the Democratic rally in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, near Washington, to support Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown, who is running for governor.

But as Obama's approval levels drop to record lows, many candidates from his party have been reluctant to appear with the president during their election races because of his waning popularity. 

Many Democrats have been wary of appearing with the president during their election races

Obama and other Democrats have been urging their supporters to vote early this year instead of waiting until Election Day.

His party is hoping to turn out Democratic-leaning voters, including minorities and young people, who frequently skip voting in midterm years.

In 2012, Democrats proved that they could use early voting as a tactic against the Republicans to give them a head start.

The strong turnout for early voting is widely seen as one of the things which helped Obama beat Mitt Romney in battleground states like Iowa.

At least 33 states will offer early voting this year, which has led both parties to encourage voters to take to the polls early.

Republicans have even decided to invest in early voting in states where there are tight Senate contests this year.
