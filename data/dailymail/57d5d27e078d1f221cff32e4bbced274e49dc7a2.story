It was a Middleton family outing as Pippa and her parents attended a high society wedding in rural Scotland - and there was even room for boyfriend Nico.

Two of Pippa's oldest friends, Rowena Macrae and Julian Osborne, were tying the knot at the lavish ceremony in Perthshire.

The Duchess of Cambridge's 30-year-old sister was accompanied by her investment banker boyfriend Nico Jackson, as rumours of their own engagement remain rife.

Pippa, who came to the wedding wearing a cat dress by Suzannah and with a bag by Emmy London, met 
Rowena on a course at the prestigious £3,600-a-month cookery school The 
Grange, in Frome, Somerset. Pippa attended the culinary college on her 
gap-year before university and the two have remained close since.

Rowena,
 who is is the goddaughter of Brigadier Mel Jameson, Lord Lieutenant for
 Perth and Kinross, is a well-known member of the Royal set and a close 
friend of William and Kate. However, with their Royal tour barely over, 
they were not at the ceremony.

Born
 and raised on her family's grand estate in the Scottish Highlands, Rowena
 is fond of outdoor pursuits, an interest she shares with Pippa. She has
 worked in a number of industries, including travel, property and PR and
 also runs her own freelance catering firm, Macaroon Cooks.

If there's one styling trick a Middleton sister can nail with her eyes shut, it's going matchy matchy.

And
 Pippa Middleton didn't disappoint with her latest outfit, as she 
attended a friend’s wedding wearing the most coordinated outfit we've 
seen all year. The Queen would be proud (and Kim Kardashian jealous).

Pippa opted for a light green coat dress, which she teamed with an olive green fascinator, and matching bag and shoes. 

Muted
 green shades were a strong fixture at the Spring/Summer 2014 shows, 
with the hue adoring dresses, suits, coats and accessories alike at 
Chloe, Margaret Howell Alexander Wang.

While
 the shade of Pippa's dress flatters her sun kissed skin to perfection, 
we're sad to say the shape just isn't doing her figure any favours. The 
round neck and empire line is a style favoured by wedding going 
Grandmothers, not a 30-something socialite with a host of fashion's most
 coveted collections at her fingertips.

Instead
 Pippa should have chosen a style which shows off her trim figure, such 
as a smart shift or a 50s style which nips her in at the waist.

Pippa, we recommend that you raid Kate's suitcase for outfit inspiration as soon as she arrives home from Sydney.

While the colour of Pippa's outfitted suited her sun-kissed complexion, the shape was not her most flattering look

Nico and Pippa have been together for about 18 months. The couple recently returned from a skiing trip at an exclusive Austrian resort

Pippa has been with Nico, 36, for 18-months and their increasing number of cosy public appearances are fuelling suspicions that they could be ready to get married themselves.

Only last month, the couple holidayed with Nico’s grandparents at luxury ski resort Lech in the Austrian Alps. The destination is so glamorous that even the ski-lifts are sponsored by luxury brands such as Dior and Chanel.

Pippa met Nico, originally from Folkestone, Kent, who made his millions at Deutsche Bank, on a previous skiing trip.

It seemed to be a family trip with Carole and Michael Middleton also present, although Kate and James did not seen to be at the ceremony
