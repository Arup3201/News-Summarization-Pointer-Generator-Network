She said she still loves eating doughnuts and pizza but you'd never guess with that ripped physique.

Showing off her incredible figure Gemma Atkinson, who is known for her love of working out, is the perfect face and body to front a sportswear campaign.

The 29-year-old former Casualty star models USA Pro's limited edition prints collection, which comes out next week.

And while Gemma admits to indulging in the odd naughty meal, she knows when to stop.

'I love a pizza or doughnuts as much as the next person but I tend to have them as a cheat meal as opposed to a cheat day,' she told the Daily Star.

'If I'm having pizza for tea I'll still eat clean for breakfast or lunch.'

The actress even said she put on 5lbs during her recent holiday to Bali with personal trainer boyfriend Olly Foster - but she still managed to look incredible on the beach.

While she's still happy to pose in front of the camera for fashion shoots, Gemma famously turned her back on glamour modelling.

She recently wrote on her blog: 'I decided to stop glamour modelling about two years ago. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it or appreciate the work I got from it, I just felt I had done enough.

'I featured on every lads mag cover here in the UK numerous times and also a few in Australia and America.

'I have been extremely lucky and I'm extremely grateful, however I have been acting since I was 14 years old and that's my passion.'

Gemma recently put her training to good use when she took part in the Great Manchester Cycle last week, completing 52 miles for the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.

The Bury-born star has also completed the Great Manchester Run twice before, once for The Christie and once for the New Children's Hospital appeal.

Women's fitness brand USA Pro are hoping to revive summer workout wardrobes with the launch of their new collection.

The fitted gym apparel comes in an array of stylish prints such as Storm, Galaxy, Blue Leopard and Auora Borelus.

The clever range features flat seams for anti chaffing, reflective prints to keep you visible when working out after dark and sweat wicking technology to keep you dry in the gym.
