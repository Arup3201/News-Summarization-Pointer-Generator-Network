The seventies are well and truly back for autumn as Joan Smalls models an array of hippie-inspired outfits for Free People.

Starring in the American boho brand's latest campaign for AW14, the 26-year-old rocks floppy wide brim hats, fringed kimonos and flared jeans.

The Victoria's Secret supermodel, from Puerto Rico, was a perfect choice for the brand's relaxed, understated style.

Joan ticks off multiple 1970s trends such as big buckle belts, paisley and shearling

The exotic beauty has modelled for Estee Lauder, Gucci, Chanel and Versace in the past, and now lends her exquisite face to the 30-year-old label loved by Vanessa Hudgens for autumn/winter 2014.

The new collection features over-the-knee suede boots, perfect for pairing with cosy knits such as their knitted kimonos or oversized jumper dresses - set to be a key look for autumn.

Wide-brimmed hats are back, as well as long fringing and short shearling coats.

'We 
couldn't think of a more fitting lady to lure us from our sun-soaked 
spell and transport us to a land of cashmere, milk and honey,' said Free 
People.

'Cozy sweaters, tall boots and the perfect jackets have reinvigorated our love for this time of year.

'Joan
 Smalls wears our favourite autumn trends beautifully and takes you on a
 journey from soft layering to rich jewel tones and intricate 
embellishments of modern Marrakesh.'

Free People launch its first full in 
house designed shoe collection this month and selected the best of 
the brand's boots for Joan to model in this campaign.

Calf high 
and knee high styles are mixed with feminine baby doll dresses and 
micro-mini printed playsuits to give them a cool edge.

The
 animal print cow hair ankle boot are a highlight and make a 
statement teamed with both simple dresses or bold prints.
