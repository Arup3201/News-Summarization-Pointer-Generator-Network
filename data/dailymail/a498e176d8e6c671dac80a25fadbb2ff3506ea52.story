It is not quite a case of Lewis Hamilton versus Nico Rosberg being the only story at the Japanese Grand Prix.

For, in the quiet hours of Friday morning, Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 17th birthday on Tuesday, will turn the wheel of a Formula One car for the first time at a race weekend.

He will become the youngest man ever to have done so, beating Jaime Alguersuari, who made his debut in the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, a fast-track promotion that caused Niki Lauda to question whether the Spaniard was safe to compete.

However, unlike Alguersuari, Toro Rosso’s Verstappen will only take part in practice here, ahead of his first race next season.

Verstappen believes his experience as the son of former F1 driver Jos has given him a lifetime’s preparation for the task.

‘This is a dream come true,’ said the Dutchman ahead of his introduction on the famously long and arduous Suzuka track.

‘It will be a very valuable experience, spending some time in the car and also getting used to working with everyone in the team, to prepare myself for next year.

‘I am not going there to break any records; I just want to gain experience.’

Most of the grid have readily accepted Verstappen’s early entry. Yet questions remain over his readiness for the elite stage, with a season in F3 his only experience, where he is second to France’s Esteban Ocon.

Sir Jackie Stewart, Britain’s most successful driver, gave Verstappen a cautious welcome, saying: ‘The world is looking at him. I’ve seen some great young drivers come into Formula One and the pressure has been too much for them. It can go either way.

But, speaking on the BBC, Stewart added: ‘He’s an experienced racing driver and has won everything that can be won in karting. Toro Rosso believe they have to give him a shot. If he does that well, he is going to become a young superstar.’
