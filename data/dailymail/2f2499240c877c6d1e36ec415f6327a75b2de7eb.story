He has been denounced as sexist, racist and a political laughing stock.

But unlike many other politicians, the outspoken MEP Godfrey Bloom clearly doesn’t take himself too seriously.

After a year in which he has grabbed the headlines for outspoken comments about aid to ‘Bongo Bongo Land’ and women being ‘sluts’ for not doing the cleaning properly, the 64-year-old and his wife have posed for a self-mocking Christmas card.

Godfrey Bloom holds bongos in their Christmas card and wife Katie does her best 'slut' impression

The MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, who quit the UK Independence Party in September to sit as an independent, clutches bongos given to him by a music shop while his wife Katie is dressed as a ‘slut’.

The photo, taken in the kitchen of the couple’s house in a village near Goole, East Yorkshire, will be on cards posted to friends and family.

Mr Bloom said yesterday: ‘It’s a little bit of fun and I’m sure the photo will give people a good laugh.

'We have done a few of these photo cards of ourselves over the years, but we only ever send self-deprecatory ones.

'It would be terribly vulgar and naff to send a Christmas card making us look good.’

And if there was ever any doubt about Mrs Bloom’s backing for her gaffe-prone husband, this picture dispels them.

Referring to equine physiotherapist Mrs Bloom, 52, whom he calls ‘Commander in Chief', he said of the festive photo: 'It was her idea.'

He said: ‘She said “why don’t we stick two fingers up at the b*******” and so we did this. It was fun to do.’

It’s been an extraordinary year for the previously little-known politician who has found himself front-page news for his outlandish comments and behaviour.

He already had a reputation as a ‘sexist dinosaur’ for comments about women needing to ‘clean behind the fridge’, then he highlighted concerns about spending on foreign aid with a supposedly ‘racist’ speech about helping ‘Bongo Bongo land’ and he followed that up by his jokey announcement at a UKIP fringe meeting promoting women in politics that ‘the room is full of sluts.’

Mr Bloom, who has recently published his autobiography, was finally forced out of UKIP after he hit a TV journalist over the head with a conference programme in an angry on-camera clash.

Relaxing at home, the former city investment manager said his wife’s pose with dusters, a glass of red wine, curlers, cigarette in mouth, apron and bright red lipstick, was her best attempt ‘to portray a slut.’ While he always enjoyed playing his pair of bongo drums.

Might some of Mr Bloom’s critics take offence again? Well if they do he and his wife certainly don’t care.
