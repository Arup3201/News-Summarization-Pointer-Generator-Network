Ian Learmonth and Ann Barnes are accused of keeping complaints into police's handling of the case quiet

Police chiefs have been accused of a cover-up as one of Britain’s most senior officers prepares to retire while secretly being investigated over an alleged conflict of interest.

Ian Learmonth, chief constable of Kent, was reported to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) in July over a review of the police inquiry into the death of Lee Balkwell, who was found dead in a cement mixer lorry in 2002.

Mr Learmonth faces criticism for letting his officers in Kent investigate how Essex Police handled the case because he himself was working for the Essex force at the time of the original inquiry.

Neither Kent Police nor the force’s elected crime tsar, Ann Barnes, who referred the case to the IPCC, have made the complaint – by Mr Balkwell’s father, Les – public.

Mr Learmonth announced he was retiring in October and will step down on January 3, before the probe begins.

Les Balkwell, who has campaigned relentlessly for justice for his son, said: ‘I made my complaint in June and, six months later, Ann Barnes has not even found an outside force to take on the investigation.

‘I am not surprised to see more attempts to cover up the truth about my son’s death. Mr Learmonth has questions to answer about his role in Essex.

'He should not have been allowed to retire.’

Lee Balkwell, 33, was working as a cement mixer driver for Upminster Concrete when his body was discovered in July 2002 stuck between the drum and chassis of a mixer lorry on an Essex farm.

Despite suspicions of foul play, the death was ruled a ‘tragic accident’ by Essex Police.

In 2010, after a series of reviews, it was announced that Kent Police would look into the case.

Last year, the IPCC ruled that the original inquiry by Essex Police was ‘seriously flawed’, and in March Lee’s body was exhumed by detectives.

Earlier this year, Mr Balkwell discovered Mr Learmonth had been assistant chief constable at Essex in late 2002, at the time of the original inquiry.

Mr Balkwell then wrote to Mrs Barnes, Kent’s police and crime commissioner, to complain. 

On July 1, Mrs Barnes’s office referred the complaint to the IPCC, but this decision was not made public.

The IPCC told Mrs Barnes that an investigation had to be carried out, but did not specify by whom.

The complaint was initially resolved locally. In early October, Mr Learmonth announced his retirement, but again no mention was made of the complaint.

Mr Balkwell appealed against the dismissal of his complaint, and this was upheld by the IPCC, which ruled his concern had to be looked at externally.

Earlier this month, Mrs Barnes’s office wrote to Mr Balkwell to inform him Mr Learmonth’s involvement would be considered by a senior officer ‘ from outside of Kent and Essex’.

Again, this decision was not made public.

Mrs Barnes posted a photograph of herself with Mr Learmonth and his retirement cake, in the shape of a police helmet, on Twitter last week.

Kent Police said: ‘Ian Learmonth was a temporary assistant chief constable at Essex Police in 2002 for three months and was at no time involved in the original investigation into Mr Balkwell’s death.

Mr Learmonth did not have line-management responsibility for the investigation and had no involvement in any review of the investigation.’

A spokesman for Mrs Barnes said only the most serious cases involving gross misconduct have to be publicised.
