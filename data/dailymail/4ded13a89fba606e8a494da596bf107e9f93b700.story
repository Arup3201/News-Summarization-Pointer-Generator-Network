A woman who was beaten so badly by her boyfriend that she needed a new nose has turned her life around since the vicious attack to become a beauty queen.

Lacy Lund's nose was so badly broken in the attack at the hands of Dean Campbell, 22, that the 19-year-old from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, needed rhinoplasty to rebuild her face.

Miss Lund's relationship ended soon after the attack, while her new look gave her so much confidence she has rebuilt herself as a beauty queen - and she hopes her story will help other domestic violence victims.

Injuries: Lacy Lund's nose was so badly broken in the attack at the hands of her boyfriend that the 19-year-old needed rhinoplasty to rebuild her face. Her new look gave her so much confidence she has rebuilt herself as a beauty queen - and she hopes her story will help other domestic violence victims

'It was so horrific being attacked by someone I’d fallen madly for, I didn’t see it coming,' she said.

'I remember the force he inflicted on my face, I felt my nose burst.

'I was shocked when the surgeons said they would completely re-build it.

'My ex left me completely broken on both the inside and out.

'But now, I’ve finally got my confidence back and I’m becoming a beauty queen - I’m determined to move on from this.

'I want to share my story to help other women who are victims of domestic violence.'

'I didn't see it coming': When the couple first met, Miss Lund was swept off her feet by Campbell (right), who showered her with gifts and flowers

Miss Lund said she had been at a friend's birthday party when Campbell, who had been drinking, arrived and became abusive towards both Miss Lund and fellow guests.

She said she wanted to leave, only for Campbell to take her to his home where he hit her.

After the attack, Miss Lund was rushed to hospital where surgeons revealed the full damage to her nose.

'Doctors told me I would need surgery and a brand new nose,' she said.

'My nose was too badly broken, with the cartilage hanging off - it was the only option - but I would have to wait a year before it could be operated on.

'I had to live with the nose that was a constant reminder of the attack.

'It was a long wait but it was well worth it.

'When I walked out of surgery with my new nose I felt like a completely new person and a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders.

'I have been finally able to live my life again and move on from what happened.

'My new nose gave me such a confidence boost.'

However, Miss Lund says she was left mentally scarred by the attack at the hands of her violent ex-boyfriend.

The teenager had been swept off her feet by Campbell, who showered her with gifts and flowers.

Campbell
 appeared at Grimsby Magistrates Court last summer where he admitted 
assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and was handed a community order
 and a £250 fine.

'I met Dean when I was 16 when I was 
out with some friends and it was his 20th birthday,' said Miss Lund, who
 works as a fish packer.

'We spoke all night and got on like a house on fire, I didn’t hear from him the next day but out of the blue he contacted me.

'Our
 relationship started then, he would tell me everything I wanted to 
hear, sent me flowers and champagne and seemed like the perfect 
gentleman.

Damaged: Doctors told her that her nose would need to be rebuilt - but she had to wait a year for her operation

'My parents worried from the start, especially my mum, she was concerned when Dean refused to meet them.

'The longer I was with him the more people warned me he was bad news, but I was under his spell and he was my sweetheart.'

The couple were together for six months before Campbell’s behaviour began to change.

Miss Lund said: 'He would call me names, towards the end I even felt like he stopped me seeing friends and family.

'I always felt guilty if I did something without him or I was happy for any reason.

'But still I wanted to save him, I thought I’d be able to change him but I was wrong.

Confidence: Following her surgery, Miss Lund found the confidence to begin to rebuild her life and go out with her friends. She was then approached about becoming a model

New life: After she was asked if she had ever modelled during a night out, Miss Lund went on to enter the Miss Hull beauty pageant

'The night when he attacked me I just kept thinking about my mum, I really thought I was going to die.

'I felt so small and useless I couldn’t stop him, he was so heavy and forceful.

'I remember feeling a huge blow to my face and my nose felt like it burst.'

The force of the blow to Miss Lund's face left her with a badly broken nose.

'He
 seemed so nice in the beginning with great prospects, a good job, great
 hobbies, good looks, I just don’t know what happened.

'I was rushed to hospital where I was treated for my injuries, and doctors broke the news about my nose.'

Close bond: Miss Lund with her mother. The 19-year-old says she hopes to help other victims of domestic violence by sharing her story

After recovering from surgery, Miss Lund found the confidence to start rebuilding her life, and was approached by a model scout during a night out with friends.

'I’d
 finally decided I couldn’t let the attack and surgery hold me back 
anymore so I agreed to go out with my friends,' she said.

'It was one of the first times I’d been out, and a woman come up to me and asked me if I’d ever considered modelling before.

'I couldn’t believe it, it was such a confidence boost. After that, I went onto enter the Miss Hull beauty pageant.

In the spotlight: Miss Lund says she hopes to continue modelling, and that she is lucky to be able to 'get up on stage and smile'

'It’s been amazing.'

Miss Lund says she hopes her experiences will give courage to other woman under threat from abusive relationships.

'Now, I want to share my story to help other vulnerable women to speak about domestic violence,' she said.

'Just talk to someone before it’s too late. I want to continue modelling but I also aspire to help other women one day with my story, I want them to find the confidence I have. I feel very lucky that I’m able to get up on stage and smile.'
