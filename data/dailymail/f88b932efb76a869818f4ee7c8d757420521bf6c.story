That Marin Cilic raced clear as the first man through to the quarter-finals on Monday represents something of an irony. There was very little clarity about his appearance at last year’s tournament.

Instead, there was a cloak of secrecy followed by a prolonged period of mysterious exile. Cilic, 25, pulled out at the second-round stage 12 months ago citing a knee injury.

That only emerged as a ploy to ‘avoid adverse publicity’ from a failed drugs test when the International Tennis Federation banned him for nine months last September.

The previous April the Croat was found to have a banned stimulant called nikethamide in his system through a urine sample at Munich’s BMW Open.

The sport’s governing body accepted his excuse that the substance had been ingested inadvertently via a dietary supplement.

He had run out during the Monte Carlo Masters in March and sent his mother to the pharmacy to buy more without realising the French version contained different chemicals. The ITF said a simple internet search would have alerted Cilic to the dangers and handed him a backdated ban accordingly.

He appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport regardless and had his sentenced halved, resuming his place on the ATP circuit at October’s event in Paris.

Soon after he turned to compatriot Goran Ivanisevic and employed him as his coach. The pair have known each other for 11 years and since their professional union Cilic has built his world ranking back up to the levels prior to his absence. He is the 26th seed here.

Ivanisevic produced one of Wimbledon’s greatest moments by winning the men’s singles title in 2001 as a wildcard and appears to have added thrust to his charge’s game.

Cilic beat Tomas Berdych, the sixth seed, in straight sets as dark descended on Friday and Jeremy Chardy went the same way.

‘The main part that is coming from Goran to me and what I  feel in this relationship is big  confidence,’ said Cilic, understandably given Ivanisevic’s indomitable character.

‘Having him over here beside me is definitely another big plus. He’s been in the second week of Wimbledon many times, so of course I’m leaving up to him all the small details to give me some advice.

‘Goran is different when he plays and when he’s off the court. When he’s coaching he’s very calm character and very positive.’

Cilic, who won Queen’s in 2012 and was beaten by Murray last year before his positive test came back, declined to say lessons had been learned from the episode but insisted personal protocols for taking supplements is ‘in a good part now’.

He added: ‘For me, the most important part was that I found some mental toughness out of all of that. When I came back, it gave me more motivation to work and use every opportunity I have to be prepared for every tournament.’

‘I used that time off as well for physical preparation. I was doing a lot. Now I am feeling very well.  I think my game is on a high level.’
