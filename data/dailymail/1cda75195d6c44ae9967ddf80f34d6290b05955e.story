A gang of men attacked an American student while he was drinking in the street - grabbing a glass bottle from his hands and smashing it over his head, a court was told.

Francesco Hounye, 23, from Florida, had been in Britain for just three days when he was set upon by the men while he was walking home with a friend in Shadwell, east London.

Shaleem Uddin, 20, 
Shadhat Hussain, 19, Kamrul Hussain, 22, and Massom Rahman, 22, targeted

American student Francesco Hounye, 23, centre, was walking home with friends when he was attacked by a group of men. They chased him before snatching his bottle of Jagermeister and smashing him over the head with it

The American student was walking in east London when the mob, pictured, attacked him - kicking him in the head before smashing him over the head with the bottle

They then chased him, beat him, and smashed the bottle over his head, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

CCTV footage shows Mr Hounye being kicked mercilessly as he lay crouched in the road.

The student suffered extensive injuries - including a smashed eye socket.

A fourth man, Samad Uddin, 24, is on trial for grievous bodily harm after the four others admitted their roles in the attack.

Uddin claims he is a victim of mistaken identity.

Paul Casey, prosecuting, said: 'This case involves a group attack involving all five of these men on one person, Mr Francesco Hounye.

'The prosecution's case, in a nutshell, is that he was caused injuries, really serious injuries - grievous bodily harm. 

The footage shows Mr Hounye attempting to make an escape as the group continue to hit him. Four of the men have admitted GBH - one with intent - following the attack last June

The court heard how the student, who had only been in the country for three days, was too scared to go out after the brutal attack. Samad Uddin, 24, denies GBH with intent - and says he is a victim of mistaken identity

The footage appears to show Mr Hounye being kicked mercilessly as he lay crouched in the road (pictured)

'All of them were willingly involved in that attack, all of them played a part.

'Two in particular played the most serious role, Shaleem Uddin and Samad Uddin.

'Shaleem Uddin used the bottle to strike Mr Hounye over the head, causing him severe cuts to the side of his head.

'Immediately prior to that, Samad Uddin and a number of others were involved trying to wrestle the bottle from Mr Hounye.'

'During the course of the attack Samad Uddin aimed a number of kicks to Mr Hounye whilst he was prone on the ground, including one which CCTV shows his right foot connecting with some force with Mr Hounye's head.'

The student from Florida (pictured in hospital) suffered series facial injuries in the attack - and was left with a smashed eye socket

Mr Hounye, who was too terrified to go out in London after the incident and has since returned to Florida, was attacked while with a friend on New Road, east London, on June 17 last year.

Mr Casey continued: 'Both of them had been drinking alcohol and Mr Hounye had a bottle of liquor with him - the brand was Jagermeister.

'They passed a group of young males and this group of young males - principally the five defendants - attempted to speak to the two men.

'The two men perceived their attitude and body language to be threatening and intimidating so they continued on their way.'

Masoon Rahman, 22, pictured, has admitted GBH - but other alleged gang member Samad Uddin, 24, denies GBH with intent

But the gang pursued the pair of friends down the road and to the junction with Commercial Road.

'When they reached the junction the two men stopped and they attempted to speak to the men who were following them.

'The two men were confronted and surrounded.'

In the CCTV footage a man said to be Samad Uddin can be seen taking hold of Mr Hounye's shoulder.

The victim was then grabbed from behind by a second male and other members of the gang wrestled the bottle from his clutches.

'The first punches are thrown at Mr Hounye, the bottle is wrestled from him, Shelim Hussain smashes him over the head with the bottle,' said Mr Casey.

It is alleged that Samad Uddin is the man seen kicking Mr Hounye across the road after he broke free and attempted to flee.

Mr Hounye was then pounced on by the mob - with the student punched against the wall

'He is kicked and punched by a man, the prosecution say is Samad Uddin,' said Mr Casey.

Mr Hounye was crouching in the street while a thin figure, claimed to be Uddin, aiming a forceful kick to the side of his head.

The gang ran off when a passer-by intervened.

Uddin was arrested in April this year after he was recognised by a police officer who had seen the CCTV footage, the court was told.

Samad Uddin, of Shadwell, east London, denies causing GBH with intent.

Shaleem Uddin, of Whitechapel, has admitted GBH with intent.

Kamrul Hussain, also of Whitechapel, Shahdat Hussain, of Newham and Masoom Hussain of Whitechapel, have admitted causing grievous bodily harm.

The trial continues.
