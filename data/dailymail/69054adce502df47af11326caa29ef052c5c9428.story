Nuisance calls: More than 90million numbers were reportedly held by the firm – the equivalent of more than one for every person in the UK (file image)

A company on an industrial estate is believed to make up to six million nuisance phone calls a day.

The call centre used sophisticated technology to leave ‘millions upon millions’ of anonymous recorded messages on mobiles and landlines.

More than 90million numbers were reportedly held by the firm – the equivalent of more than one for every person in the UK.

The Information Commissioner’s Office, which carried out a raid on the company, said it appeared to have ‘cornered’ a sizeable proportion of the cold-call market.

The small office, in Hove, East Sussex, is said to have bombarded people with offers to consolidate their debts or help them pursue a compensation claim for mis-sold payment protection insurance.

The business apparently made between four and six million approaches a day – equivalent to calling every member of the population two to three times a month.

The ICO launched an investigation after it received ‘hundreds’ of complaints about nuisance calls from multiple numbers linked to the firm. Many complaints came from vulnerable and elderly people ‘frightened’ by the barrage of calls.

Investigators said the centre would routinely call every number in its database via an automatic computer system, and – after exhausting the list – would restart the process.

The call centre, which has not been named, technically ‘does not exist’ in records, but is believed to be linked to an offshore firm registered in the British Virgin Islands. It is not clear how long it has been operating.

The ICO said it was a complex operation on an ‘astounding’ scale.

Anyone who expressed an interest in the service offered – by pressing the number 9 on their phone – was called back by one of 50 call centre workers, it is claimed.

It is believed the firm may have then sold the details of these customers to other companies, some of which appear to have shared directors and staff with the centre. Communications Minister Ed Vaizey said last night that such raids ‘show the kind of menace we are dealing with’.

The ICO’s David Clancy, who carried out a month-long investigation into the call centre, said: ‘Our intelligence has identified this address as being responsible for making millions upon millions of recorded messages.

‘It is astounding to think this one small company has the ability to pester millions of people with unwanted calls on a huge scale.’

It comes a month after ministers vowed to clamp down on rogue cold-call firms and make it easier to punish offenders. Watchdogs must currently prove that victims suffered ‘substantial harm or distress’ for a civil prosecution. But that threshold will be scrapped from April 6 when a single complaint will be enough for legal action.

They will be able to fine bosses of such companies as much as £500,000. The existing penalty is £5,000.

The Government introduced the tougher measures after hearing evidence that six in ten households are reluctant to answer the phone because of nuisance calling.

The ICO said the company invited victims to press nine to speak to a call handler regarding a PPI claim, or five to stop the calls. But there is evidence those who pressed five continued to be harassed, Mr Clancy said.

It is not known how the centre obtained the 90million numbers. If it emerges the firm was passing on the details it held without being authorised, a criminal rather than civil investigation can be launched.

Mr Clancy said: ‘I have never seen an operation of this size. Those targeted will have included the elderly or people vulnerable for other reasons. We received a vast number of complaints from hundreds of people who were frightened by these calls.’

He added that it is not known how much profit the company made, but that these sorts of operations tend to make at least six-figure sums.

It is unclear whether the firm, which is run from Gemini Business Centre in Hove, alongside 30 other businesses, will continue to operate during the investigation.

Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price, of the all-party group on nuisance calls, urged authorities to ‘name and shame’ firms using the call centre.
