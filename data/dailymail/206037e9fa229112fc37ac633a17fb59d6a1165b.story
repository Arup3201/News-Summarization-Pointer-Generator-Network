Notorious: His brother Joseph Meldish, pictured, is serving a 25-year to life sentence for a 1999 killing

A notorious mobster known for controlling the drugs trade in the Bronx and Harlem has been found shot dead in his car, police have said.

Michael Meldish - who is believed to have co-led the Purple Gang - was discovered in the driving seat of his Lincoln LS sedan in the Bronx on Friday night.

The 62-year-old had a single gunshot wound to the head and blood leaking from both ears.

The gangster's body was discovered by neighbour Janet Forbes at about 10:30pm on Ellsworth Avenue, according to the New York Daily News.

Mrs
 Forbes, 52, had been driving home when she spotted the rusty car parked
 at the side of the street - with its driver's side door hanging open 
and a motionless man inside.

Her husband John, 51, who was in the house at the time, also claimed to have heard a 'pop'.

Former NYPD commanding officer Joseph Coffey
 said Meldish's murder had all the markings of a contract killing - 
describing it as 'poetic justice' for a 'stone-cold killer'.

'It should have happened a long
 time ago,' he told the newspaper. 'Michael was a stone-cold killer. I 
call it vermin killing vermin.'

However, police have said they cannot confirm the exact circumstances surrounding the murder.

Meldish, the older brother of infamous hitman Joseph Meldish, is believed to have carried out more than 10 hits in the 1970s and 1980s with the Purple Gang.

However, he was never convicted of any hits - something Mr Coffey attributes to his ability to instil fear into witnesses.

'We couldn't get any witnesses,' he said. 'They had people so terrified, they just wouldn't cooperate.

The gang, which controlled the supply of heroin in the Bronx and Harlem, was known for killing and dismembering its rivals.

It
 was originally affiliated with the Lucchese crime family, before 
developing relationships with the Bonanno and Genovese families.

However, the crew started to disintegrate in the late 1980s as its members were arrested during drug busts.

During his lifetime, Meldish has been arrested for a number of crimes, including assault, weapon possession and forgery.

However, his neighbours have described him as a 'friendly' man who is always willing to help.

In 2011, his brother Joseph Meldish was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for a 1999 killing.

The 56-year-old shot Joseph Brown, 35, nine times inside a crowded New York bar after mistaking the victim for his lookalike drug dealer brother.

He is also believed to have been responsible for as many as 70 contract killings.

Police have launched an investigation into Meldish's murder, but no arrests have yet been made.
