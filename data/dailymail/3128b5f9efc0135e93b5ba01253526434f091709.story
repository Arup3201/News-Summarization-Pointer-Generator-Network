Jeremy Clarkson was accused of racism yesterday for naming his dog Didier Dogba after former Chelsea star Didier Drogba.

The 54-year-old Top Gear host was criticised after tweeting a picture of his black West Highland terrier and revealing he had named it after the striker, a prolific goal scorer from the Ivory Coast.

Clarkson, who often mocks political correctness, asked: ‘Why is it racist to name our amazingly brilliant dog after a footballer?’

Twitter user Gbolade Oguntomole said: ‘It’s racist man! Casual racism! You should be ashamed of yourself. I like you Jeremy Clarkson but this is wrong!’

Nick Ford labelled him a ‘racist’, while Josh Underwood wrote: ‘Tad racist.’

A user named Milo said he had been racist ‘again’.

Others, however, defended the television host, saying that the name was funny and labelling Clarkson a racist was an over-reaction.

Last month, the BBC faced demands for an investigation into allegations that he used the derogatory word ‘slope’ to describe an Asian person on Top Gear.
