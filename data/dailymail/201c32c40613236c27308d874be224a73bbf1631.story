Five super-rich families in Britain own more money than the poorest 12 million people in the country combined, according to new research.

The research confirms the gap between rich and poor has gotten so wide that even when combined together the bottom fifth of the population cannot match the wealth of the richest in the country.

The new figures published by Oxfam reveal that you can count on one hand the households with more wealth than the most deprived 12.6 million Britons, which is nearly the same number as those living below the poverty line.

The top five richest are the Duke of Westminster who is worth £7.83 billion, businessmen brothers David and Simon Reuben worth £6.93bn, the Hinduja brothers worth £6.03bn, Earl Cadogan is worth £4.16bn and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley worth £3.31bn.

These families have a combined wealth of £28.2 billion and the poorest fifth of the UK population only account for £28.1 billion.

Over the past 20 years the wealthiest 0.1 percent have seen their income expand almost four times faster than 90 per cent of the least well off.

A wealthy elite has seen their income grow by at least £24,000 a year, enough to buy a small yacht or a sports car, while the poorest nine in ten's income has only gone up by just a few pounds a week, with the average UK salary holding at £26,500 a year.

Oxfam's director of campaigns and policy Ben Phillips said: 'Britain is becoming a deeply divided nation, with a wealthy elite who are seeing their incomes spiral up, whilst millions of families are struggling to make ends meet.

'It is deeply worrying these extreme levels of wealth inequality exist in Britain today, where just a handful of people have more money than millions struggling to survive on the breadline.'

Growing numbers are turning to charity run foodbanks at a time when the highest earners have had the biggest tax cuts of any country in the world.

To tackle this the charity urged Chancellor George Osborne to target those who can pay, by clamping down on companies and individuals who avoid paying their share of tax.

They also implored that he set out a long term strategy to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, so that many on the poverty line struggling to live can survive.

However, a further £12 billion in welfare cuts has still to be implemented, while political pressure constantly mounts to offer increased tax cuts for the more well off at the next election.

Mr Phillips said: 'Increasing inequality is a sign of economic failure rather than success.

'It is far from inevitable - a result of political choices that can be reversed. It is time for our leaders to stand up and be counted on this issue..'

The pattern of a rapidly increasing wealth gap between rich and poor is not limited to the UK, and can be seen in most countries across the globe.

An Oxfam report published ahead of this year's World Economic Forum in Davos, Working For the Few, revealed the richest 85 people on the planet own the same amount between them as half the world's population - 3.5 billion people.

It warned extreme inequality is creating a vicious circle where wealth concentrated in the hands of a few is used to buy political influence which is used to rig the rules in favour of a small elite and perpetuate inequality.

It said extreme inequality like this is to the detriment of social mobility and is also increasingly understood to undermine both the pace and sustainability of economic growth.

Mr Phillips said: 'While many rich people use a portion of their wealth to support individual good causes, this should not be used as an excuse for governments failing to tackle the problem of growing inequality.'
