Theatre impresario and playboy Michael White has rubbed shoulders with the super rich and famous for the best part of five decades.

Now in his late seventies, his fascinating life story is being brought to the big screen in a feature-length documentary, The Last Impresario - a vibrant portrait of the enfant terrible of London’s theatre-land.

Ahead of the film's release, the man himself has opened up his private photo album, crammed with snaps of the stars at their most natural.

Snapped!: Mick Jagger and a young Jade

In one image Nicole Kidman looks alluringly at the camera over a cocktail and another picture shows Mick Jagger with a beautiful young Jade.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Moss are caught smiling together on a night out and even Simon Cowell makes an appearance - topless and on his phone.

Other celebrities who feature include in the intimate portraits include Al Pacino, Naomi Campbell, Stella McCartney, Paul Simon, Joan Collins, Naomi Watts and everyone in between.

But what makes these images so enchanting is that the stars are at their most relaxed. Many of the images capture the celebrities on holiday or out partying but in others they are just chilling out on the sofa or, in Naomi Campbell's case, on the bed.

The theatre and film impresario has produced more than 200 shows and films over the last 50 years and is a veteran of the A-list party scene.

He is responsible for bringing erotic review Oh! Calcutta! to the stage and productions such as The Rocky Horror Show and A Chorus Line.

He also produced hugely influential films such as Monty Python’s The Holy Grail, My Dinner With Andre and John Waters’ Polyester and is the man who introduced Yoko Ono, Merce Cunningham and Pina Bausch to the world stage.

Despite being in his eighth decade, the producer is still living the party lifestyle and has a set of friends that reads like a veritable who’s who of A-list celebrities including Kate Moss, Anna Wintour, John Cleese, Yoko Ono, Naomi Watts, John Waters, Richard O’Brien and Barry Humphries.

Fifty of his closest friends contribute to the eye-opening film, directed by Gracie Otto, about this larger-than-life character.
