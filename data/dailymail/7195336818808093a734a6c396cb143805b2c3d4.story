A discharged Marine who strung himself from a ten-foot cross during Denver's 4/20 celebration on Sunday now regrets the protest which has been branded by many as sacriligious.

Former recruiter Joshua Klohr was kicked out of the Corps last year after complaining about the job to superiors. Klohr was subsequently court-martialled and found guilty of insubordinate conduct, disobeying a superior officer and failure to obey an order.

On Sunday, he sought to draw attention to his plight so he strung himself up on the cross across from the Colorado state capital building while the rest of the city celebrated it's first legal marijuana holiday.

But when pictures of the exhibition started popping up online, the reaction was mostly unsympathetic.

'I feel like the imagery of Christ and his point (what I've gathered anyway) are two very unrelated things,' Maximilian Uriarte wrote on his web page.

Kicked out: Klohr was hoping the demonstration would draw attention to his discharge, which he believes was unjust

Even as an art piece, Christ implies martyrdom, he's just using it as "shock value." He's not a martyr, he's just a dude that got a court martial and f***** over.'

In an interview with the Marine Corps Times on Monday, Klohr quickly apologized for the display, saying he now regrets his actions.

'I donâ€™t want people to talk me up on websites as this disrespectful person,' he said. 'I wasnâ€™t trying to be disrespectful or anything ... To get people to see how serious I am I had to do something extreme.'

He added that the demonstration was not intended to be sacriligious or insulting and that his ultimate goal is to secure a presidential pardon and shed light on practices in Marine Corps recruiting.

Klohr's troubles started last year when he was working as a Marine recruiter in Boulder and having a hard time making goals, despite working 14-16 hour days.

He says he refused to 'fraud' enlistees by ignoring certain factors that would make them inelligble for service.

When he told his superiors that he could not do what was required of him in the job, they interpretted it as him quitting and he was sent to a court-martial trial.

Klohr alleges that he wasn't allowed to testify in his defense and he was subsequently found guilty of insubordinate conduct, disobeying a superior officer and failure to obey an order.

He was demoted to private, sentenced to one month in the brig and discharged.

However, Klohr admits that he himself hid information that would have kept him from service. 

He says he was expelled from school, had asthama and even a criminal record.

While he says he refused to 'fraud' enlistees by ignoring things that would disqualify them from service, Klohr admits he too hid information to get into the corps - including setting a cat on fire in 2005. Pictured above in a photo posted on his Facebook

In 2005, when he was 18, Kohlr was charged for setting a cat on fire and throwing the animal off a roof.

After his demonstration on Sunday, he could face further federal charges for wearing his dress blues even though he was been expelled from service,

A Marine Corps spokesman says they have no jurisdiction over him since he is discharged, but that a federal prosecutor could bring up the charges.
