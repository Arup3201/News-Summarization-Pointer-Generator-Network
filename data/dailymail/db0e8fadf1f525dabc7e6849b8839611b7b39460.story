It was in Zurich, in October 2007, that Brazil were awarded this World Cup and some 180 miles south of Fifa’s sumptuous headquarters a teenage footballer must have been struck by more than a tinge of excitement. 

For a then 17-year-old Alexandre Rodrigues da Silva, now better known as Pato, the timing could not have been more perfect.

Come the finals in 2014 he would be 24-years-old, and by then the prominent figure in Brazil’s attack.

Waste: Pato was on course to become a star for Brazil, but his talent never came to fruition

Fresh-faced: A 17-year-old Pato signing for AC Milan. At that point the world was at his feet

Turnaround: Italian police defend the teenager from adoring fans - now he needs protection from being attacked

Only he is not here in Belo Horizonte preparing for what promises to be a thrilling last 16 encounter with Chile on Saturday night.

Seven years on and one of the most exciting forwards in Brazil’s rich history is nowhere to be seen.

Fred and Hulk are in the team. Jo, yes Jo, is in the squad.

But Pato? He’s out in the cold, ignored by Luiz Felipe Scolari and now in permanent need of two bodyguards to protect him from angry football supporters who it is claimed tried to attack him, together with a couple of team-mates, on the streets of Sao Paulo.

It does seem like a scandalous waste of talent. Massimo Franchi, a much respected football writer for the Italian sports newspaper Tuttosport, remembers watching him train at AC Milan’s Milanello training ground around the time of Brazil being awarded the World Cup. ‘He was delicious,’ recalls Franchi. ‘So good.’ 

Good start: Pato had a strong first few years in Italy, scoring 48 goals in his first 105 games for Milan

Big stage: Pato played regularly for Milan in the Champions League after his big money transfer

Past and future: Pato, here training with selecao legend Ronaldinho, was hailed as the future of Brazilian football

Pato grew up in Pato Branco, a city in western Brazil in the sub-tropical state of Parana.

It is from his home town that he gained his adopted name, only leaving Pato Branco to join Internacional in Porto Alegre in June 2006.

He would prove an instant success, scoring on his debut inside the first minute and at 17 featuring in the squad that lifted the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup.

Better still in the eyes of Internacional fans, he would then score in both legs of the final to secure the club’s first Recopa Sudamericana.

Out here in Brazil last week Avram Grant recalled being dispatched to Porto Alegre by Roman Abramovich to recruit Pato for Chelsea.

‘The moment they knew Chelsea were interested they started demanding crazy money, so we walked away,’ said Grant. ‘But boy was he good. So quick. Great feet. Whoosh!’

Instead Pato moved to Milan, signing in August 2007 for close to £20million.

Fall from grace: The striker's final years in Italy were blighted by injury limiting his playing time and development

Troubled: The break-down of Pato's marriage to Sthefany Brito after just nine months led to a difficult time

The boss: Pato started dating Barbara Berlusconi soon after the end of his marriage putting a strain on his team

Special Relationship: Even going out with Barbara Berlusconi was not enough to keep Pato's place

Party boy: The striker's wild lifestyle has seen him linked with many women including Debora Lyra, Miss Brazil 2010

Fifa regulations regarding non-EU minors delayed his debut until the following January, but a goal in a 5-2 defeat of Napoli sparked an immediate sense of excitement .

‘He was incredible,’ says Franchi. ‘Like a Brazilian Messi. We called him the new Zico.’

The new Zico would soon be playing for Brazil too, that devastating combination of pace and skill proving irresistible to Brazil coach Dunga. He scored on his international debut too, against Sweden in March 2008.

But if Brazil loved Pato, Pato loved dating some of Brazil’s more glamorous women and this, in the view of many observers, is where some of his problems began.

In fairness to Pato, his progress would also be hindered by a series of serious muscular injuries, in particular in his thighs and hamstrings, that would cost him some of that pace.

Between 2010 and 2012 he suffered 14 such setbacks with Milan’s doctors blaming a growth spurt of eight centimetres.

Forgotten man: Despite making his debut in March 2008, Pato has only played 27 times for his country

But his critics also question if he has always taken the best care of himself.

A tempestuous marriage to Sthefany Brito ended in bitter divorce after only nine months, the Brazilian actress citing his unhealthy passion for partying as the reason for their separation.

She also threatened him with prison for failing to pay maintenance.

But life would become that much more complicated towards the end of 2010  when he then started a relationship with the daughter of his employer, Silvio Berlusconi.

Barbara Berlusconi was quite a catch, but she introduced Pato to a life not necessarily conducive to achieving peak sporting performance. ‘Pato suddenly became a member of Milan’s high society,’ says Franchi.

Pecking order: Even Jo, so hapless in England, has been preferred to Pato in the Brazil squad

Pato began to mark his goals by making a heart-shaped hand signal towards the directors’ box at the San Siro. The couple would be  photographed in the finest Milan restaurants, at the opera and on the beaches of Sardinia and Rio.

‘In Italy we say he was like a crab,’ says Franchi. ‘As a player he went sideways. He did not make progress.’

Stefano Boldrini, from Gazzetta Dello Sport, agrees, citing ‘health and personal problems’.

While his relationship was said to have caused friction in the Milan dressing room, some felt he was being protected by Barbara.

She denied this but a deal to bring Carlos Tevez to Milan and sell Pato to Paris St Germain was rumoured to have collapsed in January 2012 because of Barbara’s intervention.

In the end, though, not even Barbara could save Pato. He might have scored 48 goals in 105 games in his first three years at the club but in the final two years injuries and a loss of form limited him to 15 appearances and just one goal.

Return: Pato left Milan to head back to Brazil, but has failed to make an impact at Corinthians or Sao Paolo

After one match he was even booed by supporters.

‘Milan only sell players when they are finished,’ says Franchi. ‘Look at Shevchenko and Kaka.’

In January 2013 Pato returned to Brazil, to Corinthians in Sao Paulo for a fee of £12million.

But that, too, would prove unsuccessful with Pato’s agent claiming the coach, Mano Menezes, wanted him to leave. 

Comedown: Pato is now on loan at Sao Paolo and despite a few chances could not secure a World Cup squad

At the same time his relationship with Barbara finished, the couple blaming the distance that divided them.

Pato’s international career had also stalled by then. Dunga chose not to take him to the 2010 World Cup and six years after that debut he can reflect on just 10 goals from 27 caps.

After a decent start to 2013 at Corinthians, Scolari did give Pato opportunities to impress.

But the loan move to Sao Paulo in February came amid those reports of a clash with Menezes, the fact that Pato’s career appeared to remain on the same downward spiral convincing Scolari to look elsewhere for strikers.
