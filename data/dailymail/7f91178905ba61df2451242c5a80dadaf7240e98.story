'Kir Royale?' calls out a man in pink shorts.

He looks as if he could be one of those languidly dapper overly confident types with whom Dave Cameron spent so much time at Oxford.

I don’t mind if I do - but, sadly, his generous offer is limited to his chums seated around a long outdoor table, where they all glow in the flattering evening light.

Old-fashioned English appeal: The Gunton Arms charms with its leather armchairs and open fires

It is the most beautiful of sunsets, and I can think of few better places to enjoy it than at the Gunton Arms, a former lodge on the edge of the 1,000-acre Gunton Park deer park.

Bucolic Norfolk at its best, with a few dollops of irreverence thrown in, courtesy, mainly, of some saucy Tracey Emin artwork in the bar.

Simple yet sophisticated: Rooms boast lovely touches such as stand-alone bathtubs

This is a class act combining the skills and interests of art dealer Ivor Braka (the owner), designer Robert Kime (interior design), Kit Martin (architecture) and Stuart Tattersall (food).

There are eight rooms. Ours is small but pretty, tasteful and elegant. No TV and nothing as rudimentary as 'tea and coffee making facilities.' Even the bed valance is made of woven fabric.

Everything looks expensive, but in a understated sort of way.

The main bar is all fun and games: pool table, telly on the wall, real ales, black and white photos of Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix. This is in marked contrast to a couple of residents-only parlours, where the vibe is studious, restrained.

Country pursuits: Deer roam in the grounds of the Gunton Arms - which sits prettily in a leafy Norfolk setting

The Duchess of Cornwall could wander into the Gunton Arms and no one would be fazed. Come to think of it, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s new Norfolk pad is not too far away - but this is more of a Harry-and-Cressida (will she ever come back? Let’s hope so) place than a Wills-and-Kate.

We sit at a long sharing table for dinner, next to a window looking out to the park - where a teepee stands in the distance. On the nibbles list is pork crackling, and it’s the best you will ever find.

The fire in the main dining room is blazing in the morning, even though the temperature outside is in the 20s. There’s something not quite right about the coffee; my soft boiled eggs are hard and I’m not sure about make-your-own toast.

But the Gunton Arms is still a bohemian rhapsody that sets the standard for all other inns with rooms.
