New York officials have ripped out multiple CitiBike docking stations after rich residents said they didn't want them cluttering their streets.

At least 10 stations for the bike share scheme have been removed since they were installed on Memorial Day, including one located outside the West Soho co-op of Man Men star John Slattery.

According to The New York Post, some stations were striped from streets after legal threats and neighborhood petitions but others required a simple phone call for wealthy stakeholders to make the bikes disappear.

Bike share: New York officials have ripped out multiple CitiBike docking stations after rich residents said they didn't want them cluttering their streets

Racks outside Barry Diller's IAC Building in Chelsea miraculously appeared on the other side of the street while a station outside a Midtown East condo that is home to millionaires vanished after installation.

However, street vendors and community groups in other parts of the city have failed to command such sway.

'I've been disappointed to see CitiBike stations moved in wealthier neighborhoods,' attorney Jim Walden told The Post.

'You would think (the city) would want to avoid even the appearance that struggling artists would be treated differently than highfalutin financiers.'

Walden is trying to get the City to remove a station on Soho's Petrosino Square, and has filed an injunction with 600 signatures and 132 letters to the Department of Transportation. But it remains it place.

Meanwhile, racks at Liberty Street and Broadway have displaced five food carts that used to park there but activists couldn't persuade officials to relocate that 40-bike station.

'They ignored us, basically,' Street Vendor Project director at the Urban Justice Center Sean Basinski told The Post.

'It seems like a lot of the fancy rich people in condos got them moved, but the immigrant street vendors had no luck.'

According to The Post, the city has stubbornly refused to remove a station outside Frank's Bike Shop on the Lower East Side despite 1,000 people signing a petition claiming the rack's placement would kill off business for the independent store.

Attorney Steven Sladkus claims he's helped to block three docking stations, with the city caving to his demands while on his way to file court papers.

'I can guarantee you won't see a CitiBike rack in front of Mayor Bloombergâ€™s town house' when the program expands north of 59th Street, Sladkus told The Post. 'Maybe the same (courtesy) should have been given to all other property owners in the city.'

He pushed the Department of Transportation to move a 29-bike station from the Milan Condominium at East 55th Street and Second Avenue, where a three-bedroom home sells for $3.7 million. The penthouse in the 31-story tower was reportedly used for upcoming Martin Scorsese film 'The Wolf of Wall Street' featuring Leonardo DiCaprio.

Another load of CitiBikes were moved from outside the Frank Gehry-designed IAC Building in Chelsea after managers contacted the city, an IAC spokeswoman told The Post.

The company said they moved the station across the street because of safety concerns due to the M14 bus, however boss Barry Diller regularly holds swanky parties in the building's lobby and an unnamed worker said the racks would have got in the way.

The Department didn't respond to The Post for comment.
