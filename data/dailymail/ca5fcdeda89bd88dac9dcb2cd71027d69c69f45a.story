Carlisle have named Keith Curle as their new manager.

The Cumbrians, who sacked former boss Graham Kavanagh earlier this month, have handed former Notts County manager Curle a contract until the end of next season.

Curle's assistant at Notts County, former Sunderland and Rangers striker Colin West, has joined him at Brunton Park.

A club statement read: 'Carlisle United Football Club have today appointed Keith Curle as first team manager until the end of the 2015/16 season.

'Curle, 50, made over 700 appearances in a senior career which spanned over 24 years for the likes of Wimbledon, Manchester City, Wolves and Sheffield United.

'He started his managerial career as player-manager with (Saturday's) opponents Mansfield Town and has also held the reins at Chester City, Torquay United and Notts County.'

Kavanagh departed the club on September 9 after less than a year in the job.

Former Carlisle manager Neil McDonald, Sam Allardyce's number two at West Ham, had been expected to return to the club, but turned down the opportunity earlier this week.

Carlisle were relegated to Sky Bet League Two in May and currently sit bottom of the table after failing to win any of their first eight matches.

Curle has Premier League experience from being QPR assistant manager  between 2010 and 2012
