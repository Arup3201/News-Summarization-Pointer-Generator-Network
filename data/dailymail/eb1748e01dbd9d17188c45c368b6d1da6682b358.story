One of the most prolific killers in Los Angeles history was given an additional death sentence Friday.

Chester D. Turner, who was already on death row for murdering 10 women, was sentenced for four more murders.

'It is the order of this court that you should suffer the death penalty,' Superior Court Judge Robert Perry said.

Second death sentence: Chester Turner, 47, has killed 14 women and is on death row

Physical evidence: Chester Turner was serving a prison sentence after pleading no contest to a rape charge in 2002 when he was linked by DNA evidence to the killings of a dozen women

Turner was one of several serial killers who stalked Los Angeles-area women during a crack cocaine epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s that led some women into prostitution to support their drug habits, authorities said.

The 47-year-old Turner is one of three 
men now blamed for the murders of women who typically were raped and 
strangled.

The attacks were dubbed the Southside Slayer killings before authorities concluded more than one attacker was involved.

Los Angeles area killers: Lonnie Franklin, Jr is accused of 10 murders and Michael Hughes is on death row for several others

Two years ago, Michael Hughes was 
sentenced to death for strangling a 15-year-old girl and two women. He 
previously got life for four killings.

Former mechanic Lonnie Franklin Jr. has pleaded not guilty to 10 so-called Grim Sleeper killings and the attempted murder of another woman that took place between 1985 and 2007. The victims were strangled or shot and dumped in alleys near his south Los Angeles home.

The former pizza delivery man was convicted in June of the additional slayings between 1987 and 1997.
