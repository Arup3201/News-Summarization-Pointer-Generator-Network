Paula Deen, the queen of Southern cuisine, and her brother Bubba Hiers have been accused of sexual harassment and racism in an explosive lawsuit filed by a former employee.

Lisa Jackson, the former general manager for the siblings' co-owned restaurant, Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House in Savannah, Georgia, has claimed the conditions were intolerable.

She claimed that Bubba brought 'inescapable pornography' to the workplace, cracked sexist jokes and told Lisa to bring in photos of herself when she was younger, telling her 'you've got nice legs'.

Jackson, who worked at the restaurant between 2005 and 2010, also accuses the duo of racism, and cites examples of their use of the term n*****.

In one, she explains Deen appointed her to handle the catering and staff for Bubba's 2007 wedding and she asked Deen what the servers should wear.

'Well what I would really like is a bunch of little n******s to wear long-sleeve white shirts, black shorts and black bow ties,' Jackson claimed Deen said, according to RadarOnline.com.

She continued: 'You know in the Shirley Temple days, they used to tap dance around.

'Now, that would be a true Southern wedding wouldn't it? But we can't do that because the media would be on me about that.'

In another example, the lawsuit writes that in front of several employees, Bubba said 'they should send President Obama to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico so he could n******-rig it'.

In a third example of racism, the suit claims that black employees had to use a restroom at the back of the restaurant, while white employees could share the customer restroom.

Jackson joined the restaurant after the previous general manager, who was male, was fired for having sexual relations with the servers.

Deen allegedly said in a meeting: 'If 
you think I have worked this hard to lose everything because of a piece 
of p****y, you better think again.

'And now I'm going to do something I have never done - I am going to put a woman in a man's job.'

Although Jackson excelled in the job - 
doubling profits - she claims the working environment was fraught with 
sexism, and complained that Bubba would regularly watch porn in their 
shared office.

Former employee Lisa Jackson claims that Bubba Hiers and Paula Deen made a number of sexist and racist remarks. They include:

Paula: (on wedding catering) 'What I would really like is a bunch 
of little n******s to wear long-sleeve white shirts, black shorts and 
black bow ties. Now, that would be a true Southern wedding wouldn't it?'

Bubba: 'They should send President Obama to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico so he could n******-rig it'

Paula: 'I'm going to do something I have never done - I am going to put a woman in a man's job'

Bubba: (telling Jackson to bring in photographs of herself) 'You have nice legs'

'Bubba Hiers is a frequent customer of pornography web sites and would download and view such sites at work.

In the small office he shared with Jackson, it was impossible for her to avoid the pornography,' the lawsuit states, according to RadarOnline.com.

At a weekly manager's meeting, Bubba allegedly took along a paper copy of an email entitled 'Why gay marriage should be legal'.

It showed pictures of women having sex with women, and was passed around the table.

'No outrage was expressed and no action was taken in response to his behavior,' the suit states.

As well as the sexist comments, which the suit notes were directed at more than one employee, Jackson claims there were other sickening goings-on at the restaurant.

She claims Bubba told her that two women
at the restaurant were 'fat girls' who shouldn't be wearing skirts, and
he allegedly kissed her and spat on her, TMZ reported.

Empire: Deen recently came under fire for not disclosing she was diagnosed with diabetes three years ago

Jackson eventually quit in 2010 because of the conditions and is suing for unspecified damages.

She claims that her complaint of sexual harassment and other concerns fell on deaf ears.

It will come as more bad news for Paula Deen, who recently came under fire for revealing she has had Type 2 diabetes - a condition associated with diet - for three years.

Fellow chefs lambasted her decision to keep the diagnosis quiet, claiming that Deen, whose dishes are often deep-fried or coated in butter, had a responsibility to tell the truth about the potential effects of her recipes.
