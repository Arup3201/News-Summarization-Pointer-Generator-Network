The father of 'virgin killer' 
Elliot Rodger has said he is living a 'nightmare' as he tries to come to terms with the fact that his son was a mass murderer.

Peter Rodgers spoke about his 22-year-old son for the first time in an interview with Barbara Walters set to be aired on Friday.

In a clip released today, an emotional Mr Rodgers said: 'Every night I go to sleep, I wake up and think of those young men and women who 
died, who were injured and terrorized. And my son did that.

'My son caused so much pain and suffering for so many families.'

Film director Peter Rodger, pictured in an interview to be aired on Friday, said he was struggling to come to terms with the fact his son Elliot, 22, killed his three roommates and three others in Santa Barbara in May

Mr Rodger, a Hollywood film director who worked on The Hunger Games, spoke out for the first time about his son Elliot (above) who killed six and injured 13 before committing suicide in a rampage last month in California

Elliot Rodger, 22, carried out a deadly murder spree on May 23, killing six and injuring 13 near the Isla Vista, University of California campus.

In the wake of the massacre, the film 
director and his ex-wife released a statement saying it was 'hell on 
earth' learning their son was the perpetrator, but neither had given a 
formal interview.

Mr Rodger said this week: 'It's a reverse nightmare situation when I go to sleep. I might have a nice dream but now I wake up and slowly 
the truth of what happened dawns on me. My son was a mass murderer.'

Walters asked if the father had any clue that his son was suicidal or even homicidal. 

Mr Rodger replied: 'There is no way I thought that this boy could hurt a flea. The most unbelievable thing, what I don't get, is that we didn't see this coming at all.'

The special episode of 20/20 will air on June 27 at 10pm. It will be Walters first return to television since retiring on May 16.

While she won't have a regular show anymore, Walters will continue contributing to ABC for special projects like the interview with Mr Rodger.

The ABC interview comes just a month after the shooter's father met with the father of one of his son's victims.

Dramatic photos show Peter Rodger and Richard Martinez embracing in an emotional moment just two weeks after the spree left Mr Martinez's son Chrisopher, 20, dead.

The parents of two young men shot dead by Elliot Rodger spoke out today about losing their sons in a tragedy which they feel could have been prevented.

David Wang, 20, and George Chen, 19, were stabbed to death by their roommate Rodger, 22, at their beach-side apartment near the UC Santa Barbara Campus on May 23.

Rodger also killed James Hong, Christopher Martinez, Katherine Breann Cooper andVeronika Elizabeth Weiss before taking his own life.

George's mother Kelly Chen broke down as she told CBS: 'We have love in our heart, tears in our eyes, responsibility on our shoulders, and we hear the voice from our children from heaven. We want to do something.'

The devastated parents of David Wang, Charlie and Jane Wang (right) and George Chen, Johnny and Kelly Chen (left) spoke for the first time about their sons who were the joy of their lives. Both young men were killed along with four others by 'virgin killer' Elliot Rodger in May

Kelly Chen and her husband Johnny along with Charlie and Jane Wang believe that there were 'missed opportunities' that could have prevented Rodger's killing spree.

They also expressed their outrage at the media attention focused on the killer and an interview with the victim's father Peter Rodger.

They said that Mr Rodger had not reached out to them to offer his condolences. Following the interview, Mr Rodger sent the families a letter of apology. 

The two families, who both immigrated to the U.S. from China to give their sons' better opportunities, had said they did not want to speak out following their sons' deaths.

However they feel strongly that they must do all they can so no other family would have to endure their pain.

Just a month on from their sons' deaths, the parents said they struggle to cope with the idea that their boys are never coming home. 

Charlie Wang, David's father, said: 'I still think my son is alive and not gone. I still don't understand why this happened to such beautiful heart, beautiful lives.'

Mr Martinez met Rodger at a Santa Barbara coffee shop on June 1. They wouldn't discuss details of what they called a 'private conversation between grieving fathers', but did say that they reached common ground.

'We plan to work together so other families such as ours will not suffer as ours have,' Mr Martinez said at the time.

Elliot 
Rodger's parents issued a statement the morning after the killings that 
they were 'staunchly against guns' and support gun-control laws.

'We
 are crying out in pain for the victims and their families. It breaks 
our hearts on a level that we didn't think was possible,' Peter and Chin
 Rodger said in the statement.

'It is now our responsibility to do everything we can to help avoid this happening to any other family.'

Elliot 
Rodger killed six people between the ages of 19 and 22 on May 23 after 
years of what he claimed was rejection and ridicule and sexual jealousy 
because he was a virgin.

The
 bodies of James Hong, David Wang and George Chen were found at a 
beach-side apartment near the University of California, Santa Barbara 
campus.

Rodger also fatally shot three at random - Christopher Martinez, Katherine Breann Cooper andVeronika Elizabeth Weiss.

He
 took his own life after his shooting rampage and it was claimed in the 
days afterwards that his family had tried to get him professional help 
weeks before the massacre.

The killer's mother, Li-Chin Rodger, was the first one to realize that something was wrong at the time of his killing spree.

Difficult: The father of a college student who was gunned down in the May 23 mass killings near the University of California, Santa Barbara said he met privately with the father of his son's killer in early June

Li-Chin, 
who has been divorced for many years from Peter Rodger, received an 
email from her 22-year-old son shortly after 9pm on May 25 which 
included a 140-page manifesto.

She
 immediately went to Elliot's YouTube page and saw that he had uploaded a
 video called 'Retribution' wherein he describes how he plans to 
slaughter sorority girls.

His mother knew something was horribly wrong and she called her ex-husband and after they watched the video, they called 911.

Both
 parents rushed to the scene separately and reportedly realized they 
were too late once they heard news reports of the ongoing rampage on the
 car radio.

In
 the immediate aftermath the parents gave permission to a close friend 
to speak to the media on their behalf, explaining how Elliot had been 
receiving professional help for some time.

'(His parents) were conscious and concerned about their son's health,' Simon Astaire told CNN.

'They thought he was in good hands.'
