Neil Redfearn knew the question was coming, and when it did he saw no reason to go all coy and cagey.

Why would he? This was another Saturday, another positive performance and another important point picked up by the Leeds United ‘caretaker’.

So when pressed on whether he was enjoying all this and whether he might just be tempted to make a permanent living out of one of the toughest jobs in English football, Redfearn sent a clear message to owner Massimo Cellino.

‘He knows I’m capable,’ he said, eyes lighting up. ‘I enjoyed the second half today.’ Then after a pause he added: ‘I enjoyed the first half as well. Because you’re in charge of something that’s really good.’

Redfearn, 49, has sat in this hotseat twice before; when Simon Grayson was sacked in February 2012 and when Neil Warnock departed in April 2013. So he was the obvious person to turn to when Cellino lost patience with David Hockaday — after just six competitive matches — at the end of August.

Redfearn, who came to Elland Road as academy team boss in January 2009, has been a rock of permanence amid the choppy waters of the frequent managerial and ownership changes at Elland Road over the last five years.

So when Hockaday went, he delegated his work with the kids to others and, like a trusty substitute teacher, stepped in to the interim job once again. Only this time it feels different.

When Leeds beat Bolton before the international break, Cellino praised the ‘beautiful football’ he had witnessed and added: ‘I’ve decided to leave the team to Neil.’

The Italian, wearing designer shades as he watched his team from the stands, celebrated madly as Alex Mowatt earned Leeds a merited point and extended Birmingham’s poor start to the season.

And there’s no doubt who Cellino would have phoned on Saturday night. ‘He speaks to me about what we did in training, the team and how it’s evolving,’ Redfearn said. ‘He’s a real football nut and we can be on the phone for an hour, hour-and-a-half talking football.’

It sounds like it’s meant to be. Redfearn seems to have the trust and the ear of a man who crashed his way through 36 managers in 22 years at Cagliari.

But the job security isn’t quite there yet. When questioned if he would be in charge of Leeds for tomorrow’s trip to Bournemouth, he said sharply: ‘Yes, unless you know anything different.’

Leeds looked much improved at Birmingham. They did start sluggishly and trailed when Wes Thomas fired home seven minutes before half-time, but roared back after Redfearn had delivered his half-time team talk.

While Redfearn waits for Cellino’s number to flash up, Birmingham boss Lee Clark said he would be placing a call to David Allison, the man who appoints referees to Football League matches.

Clark was furious after Scott Duncan waved away appeals for a stoppage-time penalty when the lively Demarai Gray fell under a clumsy challenge from Giuseppe Bellusci.

‘I ring him more than my wife. I think she is getting a bit jealous to be honest with you,’ he said, only half-joking.

‘I don’t want my young, exciting player, who beats people for fun, with ease, to lose confidence and stop doing it because he’s worried about getting a yellow card.’

Clark could have done with the spot-kick. Birmingham have won just once at home in their last 22 league matches going back to October.

A travelling contingent of 2,654 boosted the crowd to a still-paltry 15,266 — empty blue seats very nearly outnumbering the fans.

But just one seat would suit Redfearn right now — the manager’s.
