Gus Poyet says his team must handle the pressure of playing in front of a national TV audience at Crystal Palace on Monday night.

The Black Cats have slumped into the bottom three following their 8-0 drubbing at Southampton and 2-0 defeat at home to Arsenal.

And they now face trial by television at Selhurst Park.

‘No-one will relax because no-one wants to be on TV doing bad things,’ he said.

‘But if you don’t have the character to go and play on TV at Palace then you shouldn't be in the Premier League.

‘It will be noisy. That is the atmosphere they like to create. But it is 11 v 11. It's a great game for us.'

Poyet, meanwhile, insists he will not shy away from dropping those who have under-performed of late, but will resist radical change.

‘There are decisions to make, which I'm not afraid of,’ he said. ‘That’s why I do the job, I like those big decisions.

‘But I don’t think it’s time to be too clever and change the shape or anything. It is one game, the Southampton game killed us.

‘I’m not going to cry, I’m going to keep trying and keep working.

‘When you’re on a bad run it is difficult to turn it around. But look at Newcastle, everyone was talking about them and now they’ve won three in a row.’
