That pot plant sat innocently on your desk may be more intelligent than you might think.

Scientists in Germany have discovered that one particular plant, the barberry, can choose whether to abort its seeds before they are ready to prevent parasitic infestations.

This is because it has something called a ‘structural memory’ that helps it anticipate future events.

If a parasite invades a barberry, the plant can abort its seeds to prevent infestation, according to new study

The team at the University of Göttingen claims that this is ‘the first ecological evidence of complex behaviour in plants’.

Barberry's defence mechanism was discovered when researchers found that its relative, the Oregon grape shrub, is infested with ten times as many Rhagoletis meigenii fruit flies.

To understand why this was the case, 2,000 berries from different regions of Germany were collected, studied for signs of larval infestation and fed into a simulation.

Scientists discovered that, rather than have a knee jerk reaction, the barberry was able to fend of fruit flies with its ability to calculate probabilities.

This parasite punctures the berries in order to lay its eggs inside them. If the larva is able to develop, it will often feed on all of the seeds in the berry.

The plant seems to ‘understand’ that when it has two seeds - one infested and one intact - it's a much better idea to release both before they are ripe to save the healthy seed.

Researchers found that the barberry did this three quarters of the time.

When a fruit only bears one seed, and that ends up infested, the barberry only releases the mature seed five per cent of the time.

‘The seeds of the infested fruits are not always aborted, but rather it depends on how many seeds there are in the berries’, said Dr Katrin Meyer.

‘This anticipative behaviour, whereby anticipated losses and outer conditions are weighed up, very much surprised us.

‘The message of our study is therefore that plant intelligence is entering the realms of ecological possibility.’

It is claimed sagebrush plants (pictured) send chemical messages through the air

A previous study found that members of the vegetable kingdom can communicate with each other.

They are 'capable of more sophisticated behaviour than we imagined,' says American bug expert Professor Richard Karban.

His
 work, which he admits is 'controversial', suggested that plants 
converse by sending chemical messages through the air, warning of hungry
 predators.

When a 
neighbouring plant 'hears' the message, it boosts its defences against 
grasshoppers, caterpillars and other invaders, he believes.

Professor
 Karban, of the University of California, claimed to have proved that 
conversations happen between sagebrush bushes - hardy, yellow-flowered 
shrubs native to the western U.S.

Using scissors, he clipped away at leaves and stems of potted shrubs, damaging them in the same way as a grasshopper would.

He then planted some damaged and undamaged plants in a field and measured levels of predation on their neighbours.

The
 leaves of the plants with clipped neighbours suffered the least 
grasshopper damage, according to the journal Ecology Letters.
