A Harvard sophomore plunged from atop a building Sunday morning and is now in critical condition fighting for his life.

Andrew Sun underwent emergency surgery after the fall and was placed in intensive care at Massachusetts General Hospital.

The exact nature of his fall and the circumstances leading up to it remained unclear as Sun clung late Sunday.

The Harvard Crimson reports that Pforzheimer House Master Anne Harrington sent an email to students Sunday afternoon saying Sun had suffered 'extremely serious injuries.'

She was not aware from which building Sun fell or why he fell.

But neither campus nor Cambridge authorities were reported such an incident in their jurisdictions, so the fall occurred elsewhere.

'College leaders have reached out to students at this time to remind them that Harvard has a comprehensive support system in place if they need assistance in light of this upsetting event,' said college spokesman Colin Manning.

Harrington wrote that she and some of Sun's friends had already visited him at the hospital.
