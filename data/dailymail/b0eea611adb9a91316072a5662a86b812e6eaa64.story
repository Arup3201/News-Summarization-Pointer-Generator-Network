Legia Warsaw's request for provisional measures that would have allowed them to take part in the Champions League playoff round pending an appeal has been denied by the Court of Arbtration for Sport (CAS).

The Polish club were eliminated from the competition when they forfeited the second leg of their third qualifying round tie against Celtic, for fielding an ineligible player.

The CAS decision means that Celtic will face Maribor over two legs for a place in the group stage

Legia will now travel to Kazakhstan to face Aktobe in the Europa League but they will continue their legal battle against UEFA, which ruled their 2-0 second-leg win over Celtic be forfeited because they had field a player that they mistakenly believed had served a suspension.

A CAS statement read: 'The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has denied the urgent request for provisional measures filed by the Legia Warszawa SA in the course of its appeal against the UEFA Appeals Body decision of 13 August 2014.

'The UEFA Appeals Body had confirmed the result 3-0 (forfeit) in favour of Celtic FC against Legia in the second leg of the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League. The UEFA considered that Legia had fielded an ineligible player (Bartosz Bereszynski) during the match.

'Legia Warszawa filed an appeal to the CAS at 17:30 on 15 August 2014 together with an urgent application for provisional measures requesting that it be provisionally admitted to participate in UEFA Champions League matches until the CAS renders its final arbitral award.'

Appeal: Dariusz Mioduski, the Legia Warsaw owner, announced last week that the club will appeal to CAS
