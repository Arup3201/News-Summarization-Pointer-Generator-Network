Loss: Audrie Pott, 15, killed herself last year after she was allegedly sexually assaulted at a party

A teenager who hanged herself after three classmates allegedly sexually assaulted her and circulated photos of the sickening attack desperately pleaded with the boys to delete the images in the days before her death, it has emerged.

Audrie Pott, a 15-year-old from Saratoga, California, took her life in September 2012 after sending Facebook messages to the boys who allegedly assaulted her at an alcohol-fueled party.

'I swear to god if u still have those pictures illl killl u [sic],' she wrote to one of her alleged attackers in the days after the party. 'It's gonna get out.'

Another male classmate responded: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.'

Potts was found hanging in the bathroom of her mother's home on September 12, 2012 after the explicit photographs had allegedly led to bullying at school.

Her devastated parents blame her death on the horrific sexual attack a week earlier at the hands of three teenage boys who then allegedly tried to cover up their involvement.

On the night of the attack, a group of teenagers were at a friend's house drinking heavily. The girl who lived at the house threw the party when her parents left town.

Three male classmates allegedly 
helped an inebriated Audrie to a bedroom before stripping her naked, drawing over her 
body and sexually assaulting her.

In police interviews, the teenagers admitted 
to coloring half of her face black with marker, then 
pulling down her bra, taking off her shorts and drawing on her breasts and near her genitals.

They allegedly photographed themselves sexually assaulting her and, by the time she started her sophomore year at Saratoga High School two days later, scores of students had seen the images.

Rolling Stone magazine has revealed the torment Audrie suffered in the days before her death and has detailed the messages she exchanged with her alleged attackers, whom she had known since middle school.

She messaged one boy, vowing to kill him if he still had the images.

'They are deleted and I didn't take them,' he wrote. 'I promise it wasn't me.'

Audrie Pott wrote a series of desperate Facebook messages before her death that have been excerpted in Rolling Stone. In one exchange, she speaks to one of her alleged attackers:

AUDRIE: i need to talk to u.

BOY: What

AUDRIE: one word... marker

BOY: What about marker

AUDRIE: u know what im talking about... i dont remeber anything about that... [A friend] had to tell me everything... i swear to god if u still have those pictures illl killl u

BOY: They are deleted and I didn't take them I promise it wasn't me... And I'm sorry about the marker

AUDRIE: You have no idea what it's like to be a girl

An exchange with another classmate:

CLASSMATE: lol that shit gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah

AUDRIE: oh my god... i f***ing hate people... Do you know how people view me now?... I now have a reputation I can never get rid of.

AUDRIE: My life is over... I ruined my life and I don't even remember how.

'I'm sorry about the marker,' he added of the drawings that covered her body.

She also messaged another boy who had been at the party to ask if one of the teenagers had photographs of her.

'ur fine,' he responded. 'ill make sure nothing goes around.'

She replied: 'It's gonna get out. S*** always does. Especially with the people who were there.'

And in an even more concerning exchange, one of her classmates sent her a message reading: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.'

'My life is over... I ruined my life and I don't even remember how,' one of her final messages read. 'You have no idea what it's like to be a girl.'

When she returned to school, she missed classes to avoid people and had an argument with one of her closest friends, Kathy Atabakhsh, who accused her of becoming a different person.

'She had been, literally, the best person
 you could meet – always honest and trustworthy,' Kathy told Rolling Stone. 'And I was so upset that she had 
changed. It was hard for her to hear that from a close friend.'

Another girl loudly pointed out in class that Audrie had been cutting herself, and the teenager burst out crying. She told friends she had cut herself on a vase.

On September 12, 2012, Audrie had texted her mother, Sheila Pott, and pleaded for her to collect her from school - but was silent on the drive home.

When they arrived back at the house, Audrie went to her bedroom and her mother went to check on her after about 20 minutes. She saw the bathroom door closed and knocked - to no answer.

Becoming increasingly concerned, Mrs Pott frantically worked the lock from the outside and eventually opened the door. But it was too late - she saw her daughter hanging inside the room.

She wracked her memory for what could have happened to her daughter. She said she remembered seeing marker on her daughter's chest - which the girl quickly dismissed - after the party, and that her daughter had called her unusually early the night after the party to come and collect her.

After the death, Saratoga police agreed with the school to wait until a week later to start an investigation to allow the students time to grieve.

But just days later, Audrie's friend Kathy went to talk to school administrators to explain what she knew about the party and the pictures of her friend.

When police arrived to interview students, there had already been rumors of an investigation and some students were heard urging others to shut down their Facebook accounts, Rolling Stone reported.

The Pott family learned of the police investigation when a relatives heard of it from a student and called Audrie's father to urge him not to cremate his daughter's body.

When police investigated the three boys, they found that one boy had apparently lost his phone and another claimed his was broken.

Due to these setbacks, it took seven months before the boys were charged. But on April 11, they were arrested on charges of misdemeanor sexual battery, felony possession of child pornography and felony sexual penetration.

When they were seized, police allegedly found new images of naked teens on their phones and added charges. One boy was even trying to sell the pictures for money, the Rolling Stone reported.

Two of the teenagers could receive community service or time in a juvenile detention center, and the third boy may be upgraded to an adult court, where he can expect to face a harsher punishment.

The Pott family has filed a civil suit against the boys and their families and an administrative claim against the school district, alleging that administrators did not respond to bullying against Audrie.

The school has said these bullying claims were never discussed.

Only one parent of the accused boys returned a call to Rolling Stone and said that the case had been misreported. He passed on their condolences to the Pott family.

But he added: 'It was a prank by a few kids, and it's blown out of proportion. Audrie had a lot of other problems in her life, and everybody in Saratoga knows that.'
