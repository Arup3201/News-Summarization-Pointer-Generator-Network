Micheal Gove has been bitterly criticised by his own advisers for axeing a requirement for schools to teach pupils about the First World War – while insisting that history lessons include examples of early Islamic, South American or African civilisations.

The Education Secretary’s new history curriculum for children aged five to 14 will be introduced next year – the centenary of the outbreak of the 1914-18 war. Traditionalists say it demotes studies of both world wars and Winston Churchill to ‘optional’ status.

Historians Chris McGovern and Tony Freeman, who were among a range of experts consulted over the curriculum, have launched a petition calling on Mr Gove to reverse his decision ‘as a mark of respect for the fallen’.

Mr McGovern said: ‘It is a national disgrace, and a betrayal of those who gave their lives for this country. The best way to commemorate the war is  to ensure children learn about it in schools.’

In the new curriculum, the world wars and Churchill are listed as ‘non-statutory’ examples of subjects that teachers ‘could’ include in lessons.

Government insiders said that  although the new curriculum would be less prescriptive than before, it  would be ‘inconceivable’ for schools  not to devote substantial time to the  world wars.

But critics claimed that some teachers would downplay the conflicts in favour of topics such as women’s suffrage or the welfare state.

Next year, when the changes will come into effect, marks the 100th anniversary of the conflict and Gove's own experts have recommended he reverse his decision 'as a mark of respect'
