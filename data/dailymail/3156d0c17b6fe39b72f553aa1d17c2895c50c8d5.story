Ministers have signalled a u-turn over their promised crackdown on high-stakes gambling machines, despite warnings they are as addictive as ‘crack cocaine’.

Hugh Robertson, the minister for sport, has ruled out immediate action on fixed-odds betting terminals, or FOBTs, despite recent pledges that the Government would tackle the high-street scourge.

Mr Robertson insisted the Government was ‘seriously concerned about problem gambling’, but told the Commons there was a ‘lack of evidence’ that the terminals were a ‘major problem’.

Labour have admitted it was a mistake to introduce the fixed odds betting machines, which they claim are as addictive as 'crack cocaine'

He called for more research and told MPs that ‘once the problem is proved to exist, the Government will act’.

Labour MPs are calling for a total ban on FOBTs, warning that gambling ‘ruins lives and destroys families’.

Mr Robertson’s decision flies in the face of previous pledges made by ministers.

The Coalition ‘quad’ of David 
Cameron, Nick Clegg, George Osborne and Danny Alexander agreed last year
to reject a call from the Commons culture committee for a relaxation of
‘puritanical’ gambling laws.

Labour's Harriet Harman and David Lammy called on the government to act to curb the high stakes machines

In July the committee said councils 
should approve more casinos, which should be allowed to provide up to 20
high-stakes gambling machines.

A bookmaker became hooked on slot machines after playing them ‘for fun’ at work – and ended up stealing £20,000 from her bosses.

Lorraine Bennett (left) began playing the machines at the Glasgow shop where she worked using her staff card, before progressing to using her own money. Soon she was embezzling from the shop by cashing in fake winning slips.

At trial, Bennett, 27, received three years’ probation and was ordered to get counselling and do 225 hours of community service.

But ministers indicated that they 
would rebuff the proposals, and ordered a review of stake levels, 
numbers of FOBTs and the prizes offered.

FOBTs are either slot or virtual 
roulette machines with maximum payouts of £500 per bet. The slot 
machines allow a spin every three seconds, and customers can wager as 
much as £2 per bet.

The virtual roulette machine allows 
three spins per minute – at a maximum bet of £100 per spin – meaning 
punters can wager as much as £18,000 in one hour. At least £46billion is
expected to be staked on the machines this year.

Labour claimed MPs are ‘up in arms’ at Mr Robertson’s decision because ‘we are seeing the victims’ in communities.

Harriet Harman, the shadow culture 
secretary, demanded action, saying: ‘We all know – there is bags of 
evidence that gambling is blighting people’s lives, and blighting our 
high streets too, given the prevalence of betting shops.’

Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins said: ‘Compulsive gambling ruins lives and destroys families.’

David Lammy, another Labour MP, told 
BBC Radio 5Live: ‘Right across the country, particularly in urban areas,
MPs are up in arms because we are seeing the victims.’

Mr Lammy blamed his own previous 
Labour government, in which he later served as a minister, for clearing 
the way for big money games. ‘We now need to fix it,’ he said.

Dirk Vennix, chief executive of the 
British Bookmakers’ Association, said slot machine gamblers ‘are 
actually enjoying an entertaining product’.
