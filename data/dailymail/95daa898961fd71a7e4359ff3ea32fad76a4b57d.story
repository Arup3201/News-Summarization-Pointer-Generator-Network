We've seen the future, and it's bright. Very bright.

So bright is it, in fact, that even eyelashes are powered by LED lights and contact lenses glow in the dark.

Thanks to Emma Freud's enlightening (literally) gadget page in Tatler magazine, we have been made aware of online false contact lens companies selling UV lenses - some without pupils, others with checkerboard patterns or Batman signs printed on the neon irises - that shine brightly in colours including hot pink, green and yellow even when it's pitch black.

Would you wear UV contact lenses?

Eyesbright.com sells coloured 'contacts that really come alive' and glow brightly under any black light source, specifically in night clubs, for £17.99 per pair.

Foureyez.com ups the ante by adding patterns to their designs, so you can buy glowing UV contact lenses with checkerboard motifs or Batman symbols on the iris for £15.99.

Meanwhile across the web, a 
London-based artist and designer from South Korea has launched the LED 
Eyelash Project and is currently developing a wearable contraption that 
makes eyes flicker with tiny lights.

Soomi Park began her art project to explore what she calls 'the fetish of Big Eyes': why women all over the world want larger eyes.

She said: 'Asian women tend to have 
stronger needs for bigger eyes as a standard of beauty, but relatively 
few of them are born with naturally big eyes.

'Those
without big eyes can only look for alternative ways to make their eyes 
look prettier, i.e., larger, by using a repertoire of skills such as 
putting on makeup and wearing jewelry.

'Sometimes,
the desires for bigger eyes can become almost obsessive, and many women
opt for plastic surgery in order to make their dream come true.'

Would you wear a contraption to make your eyelashes sparkle with LED lights?

LED Eyelash is a product still in development that enables a woman's eyes to become her main feature no matter how small they are.

The product features an inclination sensor, made with mercury, that detects the movements of the pupil in the eyes and eyelids.

Soomi said: 'If you wear it and move your head, LED Eyelash will flicker following your movements. It is as simple to use as wearing false eyelashes and as easy to remove as taking off a piece of jewelry.'
