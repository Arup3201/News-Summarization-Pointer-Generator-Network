Militants in Gaza launched a barrage of rockets at Israel early this morning as the deadliest attack against Israelis in three years threatened to escalate.

Israeli aircraft had responded to yesterday's attack, in which eight people died, by striking targets in the Palestinian territory. 

Yesterday, gunmen who appear to have originated in Gaza crossed into southern Israel through the Egyptian desert and ambushed civilian vehicles traveling on a remote road in southern Israel.

Six of those killed were civilians and two were members of Israeli security forces responding to the incursion.

The attack signaled a new danger for 
Israel from its border with the Sinai Peninsula, which had long remained
quiet under the rule of deposed Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak.

Mubarak was ousted in February and 
since then the desert of the Sinai Peninsula - largely controlled by 
Bedouin tribes - has become increasingly lawless.

Hours after the initial attack Israel
responded with an airstrike that killed five members of the Palestinian
group that Israel said was behind the incursion, an organisation known 
as the Popular Resistance Committees. The dead included the group's 
leader.

A spokesman for the group, Abu 
Mujahid, would not confirm or deny responsibility for the attack inside 
Israel, but said militants would avenge the killing of the men in Gaza.

Hamas denied any connection with the 
attacks, but hurriedly evacuated all of its security facilities 
yesterday in anticipation of more Israeli retaliation. Those strikes 
continued through the night, targeting what the military said were 
smuggling tunnels and sites used by gunmen.

Hamas officials said two children, aged 3 and 13, were killed in the Israeli strikes.

The Israeli military's chief 
spokesman, Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, said it was 'too early' to say 
that a broad escalation in Gaza was imminent.

'If we see that Hamas is choosing to 
escalate, we will not hesitate to expand the scope of our actions, 
respond in strength and exact a price from Hamas,' he told Army Radio 
this morning.

Militants in Gaza launched at least 10 rockets into Israel today, the military said.

One, aimed at the city of Ashkelon, 
was intercepted by the new Israeli anti-missile system known as Iron 
Dome. Another hit the port city of Ashdod and wounded six Israelis, 
according to Israeli emergency services.

Israel's south has been equipped with
early warning systems and bomb shelters over years of rocket fire from 
Gaza, and those measures have helped keep casualties low.

The attacks focused Israel's 
attention on its border with Egypt - 125 miles of mountainous desert 
with no fence for most of its length. The border has traditionally been 
crossed mainly by Bedouin smugglers ferrying drugs and thousands of 
African asylum-seekers into Israel.

Yesterday's attack - the deadliest 
for Israel since a Palestinian gunman killed eight people in a Jerusalem
religious seminary in 2008 - took place near Israel's popular Red Sea 
resort city of Eilat, currently at the height of the tourist season.

Some 20,000 British tourists visit  Eilat each year. The last terror attack there was in 2007.

Though the desert outside Eilat 
showed signs of an increased military presence on Friday morning, the 
city itself appeared unaffected. Joggers and cyclists were visible along
the beach.

Resident Zion Cohen, 53, said the 
steady stream of African migrants crossing the border with ease in 
recent years showed that an incursion like the one on yesterday was only
a matter of time.

'What bothers me is the unbearable 
ease with which they cross the border and the knowledge that... every 
day, every minute and every hour something can happen like yesterday,' 
said Cohen said.

A new fence is currently under construction, and the military says it will be complete by the end of 2012.

Yesterday's attacks began after 
midday when a bus carrying civilians and soldiers was attacked by gunmen
who had crossed into southern Israel from Egypt.

Over three hours, the militants, 
disguised in Israeli army uniforms, attacked two buses and civilian 
cars. An army patrol was also targeted.

A young woman who was on one of the 
buses when it was ambushed recounted terrifying scenes to Israel’s army 
radio: 'Suddenly there were bullets flying into the bus from 
everywhere.  We all dropped to the floor. There were soldiers on the 
bus.

‘They pointed their guns out of the window and returned fire.’

Minutes later, an anti-tank missile 
was fired at several cars on the same road, wounding seven. Israeli army
vehicles then drove over improvised explosive devices as they raced to 
the scene, with an explosion injuring several soldiers.

Losing control: The attacks on soldiers and civilians in Israel's south yesterday fueled concerns that Egyptian security forces are losing control of the Sinai desert region bordering Israel
