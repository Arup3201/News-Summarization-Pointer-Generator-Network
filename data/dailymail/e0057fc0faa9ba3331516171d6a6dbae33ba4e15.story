Robbie Rogers, the former U.S. soccer player who retired from the sport after announcing he is gay has talked about hiding his sexuality in the 'macho' world of professional sports.

In a TV interview with ABC's Nightline, Rogers spoke about going to visit his tight-knit, conservative, Catholic family for the first time since coming out in February.

The 25-year-old also revealed that he is considering returning to soccer in the U.S. This would make Rogers the only openly gay player in any professional men's team sport.

Honest: In a TV interview with ABC's Nightline, Rogers spoke about going to visit his tight-knit, conservative, Catholic family for the first time since coming out in February

In the interview with Nightline that will air on Monday, Rogers said he hid his homosexuality so he could fit in with the soccer environment.

'Because it's sports. It's the stereotype that you're supposed to be this manly guy that is making tackles. It's beating up on other guys,' Rogers explained.

Rogers rose to prominence at
Columbus Crew in MLS, scoring 13 goals in over 100 appearances and 
earning international colors in the process.

He then moved to Leeds United, a team
in the second tier of English football, on the advice of USA coach 
Juergen Klinsmann.

Rogers struggled with injuries and, after making only
nine appearances in five 
months on loan at Stevenage, he decided to call it a day and came out in a heartfelt blog entry.

But Rogers explained: 'I think the same things that made it difficult for me to come out also gave me the strength. I was raised to be a voice, to be myself, to be unique, not to follow a pack.'

While Rogers ponders a future return to soccer in the U.S. he visited his family in Huntington Beach, California, for the first time in person since the announcement and recalled his upbringing.

'You grow up learning that who you are isn't natural, or is a sin,' Rogers said. 'It does have an impact - it scares you, it really scares you.'

But Rogers is content with his 
decisions. 'Gay athletes are athletes,' he declared. 'If I go back to 
soccer, I want to go back as Robbie. I just want it to be as simple as 
that.'

The Southern California native currently based in London, made his announcement in a heartfelt blog entry.

The winger revealed how he would feared he would suffer discrimination if he revealed his sexuality.

In a blog entitled ‘The Next Chapter’,
Rogers wrote: ‘Things are never what they seem. My whole life I have 
felt different. To overcome your fears you must be strong and have faith
in your purpose.

‘For the past 25 years I have been 
afraid to show who I really was because of fear that judgment and 
rejection would hold me back from my dreams and aspirations.'

Only a handful of footballers have ever announced they are gay as many still fear coming out will damage their careers.

Footballer Justin Fashanu was the first and only English player to publicly announce he was homosexual.

The Norwich City and Nottingham Forest player committed suicide eight years later in 1998.

Rogers, who represented his country 18 times, including at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, also told how he kept his sexuality a secret even from his friends and family.

He wrote: 'Fear that 
my loved ones would be farthest from me if they knew my secret.

‘Life is only complete when your loved
ones know you. When they know your true feelings, when they know who 
and how you love. Life is simple when your secret is gone. Gone is the 
pain that lurks in the stomach at work, the pain from avoiding 
questions, and at last the pain from hiding such a deep secret.

‘Secrets can cause so much internal 
damage. Try explaining to your loved ones after 25 years you are gay. 
Try convincing yourself that your creator has the most wonderful purpose
for you even though you were taught differently.

‘I always thought I could hide this 
secret. Football was my escape, my purpose, my identity. Football hid my
secret, gave me more joy than I could have ever imagined… I will always
be thankful for my career.’

Rogers, who has more than 75,000 followers  finishes his blog with: ‘I will 
remember Beijing, The MLS Cup, and most of all my teammates. I will 
never forget the friends I have made along the way and the friends that
supported me once they knew my secret. 

A host of MLS players and international teammates have voiced their encouragement about Rogers' decision.

New England Revolution and U.S. midfielder Benny Feilhaber wrote: 'proud to call you my friend.'

New York Red Bulls and U.S. defender Heath Pearce tweeted: 'proud of you fam!'

Chivas USA keeper Dan Kennedy offered 'ur the man Robbie we support u bro,' while teammate Juan Agudelo tweeted: 'Respect man. Proud of you bro.'

LA Galaxy and USA center back Omar Gonzalez wrote, 'Congrats, Robbie! Really happy for you.'

Gonzalez's fellow LA defender A.J. DeLaGarza tweeted, 'good for you man! All the best! Terps.'

FC Dallas goalkeeper Chris Seitz praised Rogers' courage saying, 'really want to give a huge shout out to a great friend for being one of the bravest men I know'

D.C. United's Chris Pontius wrote, 'Much respect. Nothing but support for you.'

Vancouver Whitecaps defender Jordan Harvey chimed in with: 'Congrats brotha. Wish you the best.'

‘Now is my time to step away. It’s 
time to discover myself away from football.  It’s 1 A.M. in London as I 
write this and I could not be happier with my decision.

'Life is so full of amazing things. I realized I could only truly enjoy my life once I was honest.

'Honesty is a bitch but makes life so 
simple and clear. My secret is gone, I am a free man, I can move on and
live my life as my creator intended.’

Roger played for the U.S. national team 18 times, scoring twice. He featured in all three of the team's games at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup squad.

Ruth Hunt, director of public affairs
for UK-based lesbian, gay and bisexual charity Stonewall, said: 'It's 
great that Robbie now feels able to be open about his sexuality but it 
remains a shame that no professional player feels able to be out during 
their career.

'Homophobia remains rife in football and we must work together to stop it for the sake of the game.'

Gordon
Taylor, chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association in the 
U.K., told the Press Association: 'I'm pleased that he's come out for his 
own sake. We do have players who've said that, while they are gay, they 
don't feel comfortable enough to come out.

'It's
not dissimilar to many black players, and we need to create a safe 
environment for them on and off the field. If there is abuse, that needs
to be dealt with by all the football family.

'It's no bad thing that he's 
been brave enough to come out. We know of players who are playing who 
are gay who've not had that confidence as yet. But, as the rest of the 
world becomes more civilized, hopefully that will come.'

Another American player, David Testo,
came out after retiring from football in 2011. He also played for 
Columbus Crew, albeit before Rogers, later moving to Canada where he 
played for Vancouver and Montreal.
