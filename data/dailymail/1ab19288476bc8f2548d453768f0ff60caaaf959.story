Supporters of MMA fighter Jon Koppenhaver who is alleged to have beaten up his ex-girlfriend and porn star Christy Mack have shared a photograph of her out in Las Vegas in an attempt to discredit her claims of assault.

The image of Mack was shared via Twitter on Sunday by user @Grenade_112 who accompanied alongside the picture that the porn star was ‘good enough to go partying a couple nights ago’ and claimed the image showed her outside a club.

The original source of the image was taken by another Twitter user, who is not part of the ‘Free War Machine’ group.

Mack, responded to @Grenade_112 to confirm that the picture was her just getting some ice cream, adding: ‘I’m not sure that picking up food in our sweat pants is “a night on the town”.’

‘You can see the damage to my face even in the dark. And I can’t drive myself,’ she wrote. ‘I get out about once a day for a little bit. It’s depressing staying in 1 room sleeping all day.’

Koppenhaver who is also known as ‘War Machine’ is accused of leaving Mack in hospital with brutal injuries - including multiple broken bones around her face - after savagedly beating the porn star in her apartment on August 8.

Injuries: After the alleged attack at her apartment on August 8, Mack posted pictures of her horrific injuries online; after she shared the images, police put out a warrant for Koppenhaver aka War Machine's arrest

After the alleged assualt, Mack took to Twitter to post images of her injuries as Koppenhaver went on the run.

Police had issued a warrant for his arrest and, after a week on the run, he was caught at a hotel in the Simi Valley in California. He remains in jail, awaiting extradition to Nevada.

Koppenhaver is scheduled to appear in Ventura County Superior Court on September 2 to face charges of assault against Mack.
