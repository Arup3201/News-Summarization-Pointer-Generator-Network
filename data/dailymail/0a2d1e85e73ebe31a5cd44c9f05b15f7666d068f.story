With gifts 'inspired' by royal artwork, you might expect them to be fit for a Queen.

But it emerged yesterday that Buckingham Palace is selling royal-themed gifts shipped in from overseas.

While some items are labelled as being made in England, the Royal Collection Trust shop sells teddy bears flown in from China and towels made in the EU.

This Royal Nursery teddy bear, £12.95, which is just one of a large selection of good which are manufactured in China for sale in the Palace shops

The Royal Nursery teddy bear, on sale for £12.95, was one of a large selection of goods made in China and which are sold at official outlets at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh and online. 

A pair of children's Corgi slippers, selling for £15.95, are also manufactured in China while white towels with the Buckingham Palace insignia embroidered  in gold stitching, at £21.95 for a bath towel and £15.95 for a hand towel, are made in the EU.
