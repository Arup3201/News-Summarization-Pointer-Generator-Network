A relaxed diver drifts with the ocean current - as a fearsome 8ft killer shark circles around him.

But Vincent Canabal, 34, seems unphased by the oceanic whitetip - despite the species being thought responsible for the most human deaths by sharks in history.

The powerful hunters have a grisly reputation for dining on shipwrecked sailors - most famously during the sinking of the USS Indianapolis in 1945.

This serene picture was captured by photographer Michael Patrick O'Neill, 46, in the crystal-clear waters off Cat Island in the Bahamas.

He said: 'Despite their reputation, the oceanic whitetip shark, and most sharks for that matter, are very cautious and reluctant to approach people.

'The only reason why they are near divers is because we attracted them with a little bit of chum.

'The
 main thing is to always be cautious, swim slowly without splashing and 
jerky movements, and to always know where the sharks are located.

The oceanic whitetip sharks are known for their aggressive nature.

They tend to dominate feeding frenzies and are known to target shipwreck or air crash survivors.

The Oceanic whitetip are thought to have been responsible for many of 
the deaths of sailors who abandoned the sinking USS Indianapolis which was
 torpedoed on 30 July 1945.

That event was the greatest single loss of life at sea in the history of the U.S. Navy

'One
 of the key things for an underwater photographer taking pictures of 
sharks is to not only pay attention to the shark being photographed, but
 to others that may be swimming or approaching from the back.'

Oceanic whitetips, along with many other shark species, have experienced a dramatic decline due to the shark fin trade.

But in 2011 the Bahamas prohibited commercial shark fishing and its waters have now become a 'sanctuary' for about 40 species, according to Mr O'Neill, who lives in Florida.

He said: 'Divers come from all over the world to see them. In short, Bahamians have monetised their sharks, turning them into a recurring source of tourism revenue - a much smarter alternative than killing and selling the fins.'

Oceanic whitetips, along with hammerheads, received protection at the conclusion of the 2013 CITES meeting in Bangkok.

Mr
 O'Neill, who was born and raised in Sau Paulo, Brazil, is an an 
award-winning photographer, author, and conservationist specialising in 
marine wildlife and environmental issues.
