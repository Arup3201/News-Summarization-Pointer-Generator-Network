Wearing his sister’s skirt to school certainly got Chris Whitehead noticed.

Now it has also secured a nobler aim – and forced his school into a climbdown over its ban on shorts.

Chris, 13, made headlines with his outrageous method of protest at being prevented from wearing shorts in hot weather.

Skirting the issue: Chris Whitehead, pictured last year, has finally made a breakthrough against his school's uniform policy following his unusual protest

He brought national scrutiny to the uniform policy at Impington Village College, Cambridgeshire, when he turned up for lessons in a knee-length skirt last year.

He claimed it was unfair that girls were allowed to wear skirts while boys were banned from wearing shorts.

Forcing boys to wear long trousers during warm weather had a negative effect on their concentration, he argued.

Around 30 friends joined him at the school gates to beg headteacher Robert Campbell to reconsider.

They displayed banners reading ‘Cool Shorts Not Hot Pants’, ‘Shorts For The Long-term’ and ‘Boy’s Legs Deserve Better’,

Equality: Chris had argued it was unfair male pupils were made to wear trousers even in sweltering summer months

Yesterday Chris claimed victory after the school announced that boys would be allowed to wear shorts after half-term for the rest of the school year.

The youngster, who hopes to become a politician, welcomed the decision but added: ‘It’s a shame that only a little has changed after such a long uniform review. It seems that the adults influenced the decision more than the students themselves.’

The 1,368-pupil school, which was classed as ‘good’ in its latest Ofsted inspection in 2006, imposed the shorts ban two years ago after a consultation with parents and teachers.

Its code stated that students must wear ‘plain black tailored trousers or knee-length skirts without slits’ – but did not specify gender.

This meant that while shorts were prohibited, boys were free to wear skirts as long as they were ‘free-moving, not tight against the legs’.

Chris won support across the country, with Daybreak presenter Adrian Chiles donning a skirt in solidarity.

The schoolboy was even named runner-up in Liberty’s human rights young person of the year competition in London.

Yesterday his parents Brian Whitehead and Liz Hill said: ‘We hope that Chris’s campaign inspires other young people to take a stand for things they believe in.

‘In this case, he has won his campaign for shorts – if only for a trial period – but in the future there will no doubt be other more significant issues for him to engage with.’
