For years, all Butch the Boston Terrier knew was a life of roaming the streets, rifling through trash cans in the hope of finding a meal.

But for one week, he got to experience unwavering love thanks to Alicia Buzbee and her daughter Kansas, who found him in Pinson, Alabama and threw him a party before he was put to sleep.

As a puppy, the terrier had an owner and a home but, after a couple of years, the owner cast the dog out and he was left to live in the streets, AL.com reported.

He lived off scraps and found shelter from the frost, but a week before Thanksgiving, Buzbee and her daughter discovered him lying in a front yard, struggling to breathe.

Loved: Alicia Buzbee and her daughter Kansas found Butch, a homeless and dying Boston terrier, the week before Thanksgiving and lavished him with attention for a few days until he had to be put down

Celebration: They threw Butch a 'farewell' party where he met Santa Paws and opened gifts 

Joy: The pup, who had been abandoned by his owner years ago, dons a cute hat for his party

They took him to a veterinarian at the Birmingham Boston Terrier Rescue and learned that he had almost no lung capacity, his trachea was leaking and his heart was swollen.

The vet suggested he be scheduled for a 'humane euthanasia' and the women planned a final hurrah for the dog.

For a few blissful days over Thanksgiving, he feasted on burgers and pumpkin pie, enjoyed playing with new toys and relished in the attention from his temporary owners.

Then they threw him an early Christmas 'going away' party, where he sat on Santa's lap and donned a party hat as he opened more gifts.

Care: The dog, who had a swollen heart, experienced more love in his last few days than he did in his life

Treats: Butch, pictured with Kansas and friends left, took trips to PetSmart for new toys and treats

At home: Butch, pictured grinning with Kansas, showed marked improvement during his few days of joy

The Buzbees noticed that Butch perked up after all the attention and was no longer struggling to breathe, so the trip to the vet was put off.

But a few days later, his condition worsened again. 

'Before he goes, I want him to look into my eyes, and I want to look into his eyes, and I want to whisper, "I love you",'  she told AL.com.

'I want him to hear those words and to see those faces of the people who love him.'

Last Saturday, she carried out her wish and put Butch down with her family by their sides. 

She said that she was overjoyed that she could bring a few days of joy to the abandoned pup and that she saw him become hopeful in that final week.

'The heart can do so many things when it gets what it needs,' she said. 

Dog days: Butch took a turn for the worse at the end of last week and was put down on Saturday
