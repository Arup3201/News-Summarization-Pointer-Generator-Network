'Devastated': Damien Hirst threw a party this weekend at his Toddington Manor home

He is said to be devastated by the end of his relationship with the mother of his three children.

But Damien Hirst appeared to be putting on a brave face yesterday.

The one-time bad boy of British art, who turned 47 last Thursday, went ahead with a party in the grounds of one of his country homes only hours after news broke that his partner Maia Norman had left him for former mercenary Colonel Tim Spicer.

Hirst, the world’s richest artist, 
had hired a funfair ride named ‘Freak Out’ for the party, along with a 
full-size helter-skelter and another white-knuckle ride named The Rotor.

Neighbours
 said Hirst’s staff and their families were among the guests invited to 
the bash in the grounds of his £3.5million farmhouse in Combe Martin, 
North Devon.

Yesterday 
fans expressed their sympathy to Hirst after Miss Norman confirmed she 
was leaving him after 19 years for former soldier-of-fortune Spicer, who
 is 12 years older than the artist.

Hirst was said to be shocked and devastated after she confessed to the affair several weeks ago.

Eleven
 days ago, California-born Miss Norman, 49, was photographed in 
Hollywood tenderly kissing Spicer in front of 150 journalists attending a
 car rally.

She embraced her lover for a second time before the pair walked arm-in-arm into a hotel lobby.

An
 onlooker said: ‘They looked incredibly comfortable and happy to see 
each other. You got the feeling this was the real thing, not just a 
fling.’

When approached and asked whether she was leaving Hirst for Spicer, Miss Norman said ‘yes’ before declining to speak further.

Divorced Spicer, the father of a teenage son, remained silent, although yesterday a spokesman confirmed he did not deny the story.

Spicer, 59, is a former Lieutenant Colonel in the Scots Guards and a Falklands veteran. He came to prominence through his company Sandline during the ‘arms-to-Africa’ controversy in 1998. He now runs Aegis Defence Services, a security firm that has won multi-million-pound contracts with the US government in Iraq and Afghanistan.

For his part, Leeds-born Hirst is the most successful living artist. His controversial works, which include a dead shark encased in formaldehyde and a skull made from diamonds, have helped him earn what is believed to be a £215million fortune.

Last night, however, lawyers said Miss Norman might be entitled to very little of that money because the couple – whose children are aged 16, 12 and six – never married.

Ayesha Vardag, of London solicitors Vardags, said: ‘They are not married and, in England, the rights of cohabitees are extremely limited, even if they have been in a relationship for a long time and even if they have three children.

‘It all depends on whether they have a
 joint bank account and if her name is on the title deeds of the various
 properties. If not, she could be entitled to very little for herself.’

As
 well as the 300-year-old Grade II-listed Devon farmhouse, which is the 
main family home, Hirst also owns a restaurant, a pub and an art studio.

Toddington Manor: The £3 million home houses Hirst's art collection

In 2005, he paid £3million for Toddington Manor, a gothic pile in Gloucestershire that he is renovating to house his art collection, and he also owns a house in Thailand, a beach home in Mexico and a houseboat moored on the Thames in Chelsea.

Although they never married, Hirst and Miss Norman used to refer to each other as husband and wife, and their relationship was seen as one of the art world’s most stable.

Sources stressed their main priority now was the welfare of their children.

It is not known how Spicer came to know Miss Norman but neighbours in Devon have speculated he could have helped to arrange the security guards who monitor the entrance to Hirst’s home.
