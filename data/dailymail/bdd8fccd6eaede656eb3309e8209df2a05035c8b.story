A midwife with more than 20 years' experience may be able to return to her position despite being sacked for telling a woman in labour that she would 'get the baby out with a knife and fork'.

Marion Owens, a senior nurse at Liverpool Women's Hospital, was dismissed after the foul-mouthed rant in which she also told the patient: 'I've been a midwife for 20 f****** years and no f***** is telling me how to f****** care for a f****** woman in labour'.

Mrs Owens, who had worked at the hospital since 1993, admitted charges brought by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and agreed to be subjected to certain sanctions for three years.

However, an NMC panel this week rejected the provisional agreement and ruled that Mrs Owens should face a fresh hearing because the case 'although serious, was at the lower end of the scale of misconduct'.

It means that while she initially faced working under sanctions for three years due to her behaviour, she may be able to return to midwifery work as normal if given permission to do so by the panel.

The tribunal heard that Mrs Owens had returned to work at the hospital following an absence when she launched the tirade on June 14, 2012.

The CPD agreement told how the patient recounted Mrs Owens 'slurring her speech and behaving erratically'.

The patient was not named in evidence of the case, but was instead referred to Patient A.

The judgement read: 'Patient A refers to the registrant recounting a previous patient who had a hypnotist as their birth partner.

'She refers to the registrant then becoming animated and saying to her and her birth partner that she "had been a midwife for 20 f****** years and no f***** is telling me how to f****** care for a f****** woman in labour".

'The patient refers to her shock that a health professional would use this language in a clinical area.

'She also recounts feelings of concern when the registrant said to her "I will get your baby out with a knife and fork".

The matter will now be listed for a fresh hearing with the panel from the Nursing and Midwifery Council (above)

Mrs Owens, who also admitted failing to ensure that patients wore name bands, keeping timely notes, and using a drug to induce a patient before it had been prescribed, admitted 'her actions fell seriously short of what would be expected of a registered midwife' and that the language had been 'entirely inappropriate'.

The NMC said there was no evidence to suggest any harm was caused to any of the patients in her care on June 14, 2012 and that Mrs Owens had displayed remorse and insight into her behaviour.

Panel chair John Weedon said: '[The panel] was satisfied that a member of the public in full knowledge of the circumstances of the case, and being aware of the insight and remediation demonstrated, would not consider a finding of impairment necessary to uphold the reputation of the profession and maintain proper standards.

'In all the circumstances, the panel was unable to endorse the CPD agreement in relation to the finding of impairment.'

Since May, 2013, Mrs Owens has worked as a nurse at Liverpool's Church View Care Home.

The panel said it did not consider there was a 'real risk' of her behaviour being repeated.

Mrs Owens, who had worked at the hospital for more than 20 years prior to the tirade of abuse, admitted charges brought by the Nursing and Midwifery Council and now faces a disciplinary hearing over her conduct

The matter will now be listed for a fresh hearing at a future date and if cleared, Mrs Owens may be able to return to her position as midwife.

A spokesman for Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust said: 'Following a comprehensive management investigation, the Trust can confirm that, whilst no direct patient harm was found to have been caused, the midwife in question was deemed to have displayed serious and significant failings in her professional duty of care.

'This investigation resulted in her dismissal from Liverpool Women's in December 2012 and the Trust also referred its findings to the midwife's professional body, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC).

'Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust is dedicated to providing safe, effective and compassionate care to all our women, their babies and their families.

'Any incidents that may impact on our ability to deliver those high standards are dealt with in a prompt and appropriate manner.'
