Wilmington police are now investigating the death of a toddler who died late Friday after being hospitalized with heavy bruising and brain injuries whose cause has yet to be determined.

A’Niah Davila-Torres, one-and-a-half years old, was brought severely injured to St. Francis Hospital Tuesday by a daycare provider and her boyfriend.

Police began to probe the cause of the injuries, and a medical examiner photographed them Friday night shortly before she passed away.

The toddler's mother, Vinnia Davila, blames the daycare provider and contacted police.

'She's brain-dead,' she told The News Journal.

Police have so far declined to characterize the investigation.

'All
 I can say is that we’re investigating the alleged circumstances of the 
baby’s injury,' said Wilmington Police Department spokesman Cpl. Jamaine Crawford.

The girl's daycare provider has yet to be publicly identified.

According to Davila, she left her daughter and son Aston, 2, at the woman's home Tuesday.

The child care provider has been watching the children since A'Niah was 6 weeks old.

Davila did not see her daughter again until she had been admitted to the hospital.

The bruise over the left of the girl's face from forehead to chin and other around her right ear were the result of 'physical abuse,' a doctor told Davila.

She says she was informed of her daughter's condition when the daycare provider sent a text to Davila's mother.

The daycare provider left the girl at the hospital to work a night shift for Amazon.

Upon reviewing the infant's injuries, doctors said there was no blood flow to the brain.

A preliminary check of records by the state Department of Services for Children, Youth, and Their Families could not find a listing of the unidentified child care provider having a license.

As the family gathered around her hospital bed to say goodbye to A’Niah, brother Aston told them what he saw.

'As
 soon as he saw her, he said, ‘They hit her, they hit her,’' said 
his mother's cousin Morris. 'We tried to ask him ‘Who?’ but all he 
would say is ‘They hit her, they hit her.’ He kept saying that.'
