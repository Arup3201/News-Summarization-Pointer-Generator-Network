Playing under David Moyes brought about embarrassment for Rio Ferdinand, who has revealed the former manager slowly lost the dressing room.

In an explosive autobiography - #2Sides - serialised in The Sun, Ferdinand laid bare the difficulties United endured during a turbulent season that undermined the foundations built over two decades.

Moyes’ disastrous reign saw the club drop out of all European competition and fall way short of rivals Manchester City.

And the central defender, who was allowed to leave Old Trafford on the Scot’s say-so, felt Moyes’ mentality wasn’t befitting of the club’s stature.

‘He tried to impose a vision but never seemed to be completely clear what that vision should be,’ Ferdinand writes. ‘Unintentionally, he created a negative vibe where, with Fergie, it had always been positive.’

Ferdinand’s main grievance was the way in which Moyes went about trying to win games – stark contrast to the free-flowing, attractive style with which Louis van Gaal is beginning to implement again. The now Queens Park Rangers man saw that to his cost on Sunday as Unitedran out comfortable 4-0 winners.

‘He’d slowly lost us. I didn’t enjoy playing under him. Sometimes our main tactic was the long, high, diagonal cross. It was embarrassing,’ Ferdinand added.

‘Moyes’s innovations led to negativity and confusion. It was always how to stop the other side. Moyes set us up not to lose. We’d been accustomed to playing to win.’

Ferdinand also cited Moyes's decision to prevent United's players from indulging in chips as a big grievance among the players.

The former England captain insists that the players always ate low-fat chips on the night before a game under Ferguson's rule. 'We loved our chips,' he writes.

But Moyes banned the food after just a week in charge at United leaving the squad 'p***** off.'

Ferdinand highlights Javier Hernandez as one player who felt especially put out by Moyes's management.

The Mexican was 'happy for three years', according to Ferdinand, benefitting from Fergie's arm around his shoulder.

But Moyes's different man-management techniques meant Hernandez's confidence ebbed away, says Ferdinand.

Moyes was sacked shortly after United's Champions League exit to Bayern Munich last April, and Ferdinand says the squad's preparation for that game 'seemed wrong'.

United were taken to a public park to practice set pieces, claims Ferdinand, in a decision he brands 'bizarre'.
