She may be just three months old, but David and Victoria Beckham's new arrival is already gearing up for a high-flying life.

The couple took little Harper along to get her first passport today at the Wilshire Federal Building in Los Angeles.

Baby Beckham was all dressed up for the occasion in an adorable print frock, cardigan and tights.

She even had a bow-trimmed headband to top off the sweet look.

David and Victoria were dressed casually by comparison in jeans and T-shirts.

The LA Galaxy star has just had a new tattoo inked on his hand, however he kept it hidden covered during the outing.

But Posh later posted a picture of the new ink - the word 'love' on his left hand - on her Twitter page.

Along with the photograph, which was of both David and his daughter's hands, she wrote: 'Harper loves Daddy's new tattoo of love. X V'

Harper is required to have an American passport because she was born in the US.

Under the law both parents must be present to obtain the legal document for a minor.

A onlooker toldÂ X17Online: 'Security was extremely tight while David and Victoria walked in.'

'Armed Federal agents stood guard outside the building while they handled the paperwork inside.'

No doubt David and Victoria will soon be taking the infant back home to the United Kingdom to see their family.

Despite living in the US at the moment, they make regular trips back to England, and the former Manchester United player often makes trips to see his old team play.

Harper has already chalked up some frequent flyer miles after accompanying her mother to New York for the city's fashion week last month.
