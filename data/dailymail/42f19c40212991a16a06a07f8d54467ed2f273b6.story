President Barack Obama has received the SNL treatment with a sketch that took aim at his executive order vetoing Congress to secure the protection of at least five million immigrants from deportation.

The Bill from the educational series Schoolhouse Rock! arrives at Capitol Hill to explain to a student the route he makes through Congress.

But the lesson is disrupted by a calm, collected and smiling Obama who kicks him down the steps - before introducing a very laid back Executive Order.

An education: SNL staged a mock version of Schoolhouse Rock! informing viewers how President Obama vetoed Congress with an executive order to protect five million immigrants from deportation 

Smoking a cigarette, Executive Order explains he is used for simple things, like declaring holidays and creating national parks.

That is until Obama reveals he will be used to grant amnesty to millions of immigrants.

'Whoa... Go hard or go home, right?' the flummoxed Executive Order remarks to the camera.

The president then asks the student what he thinks about politics.

'I think I want to go into the private sector,' the boy remarks.

'Me too,' Obama replies with a knowing grin.

The sketch comes amid a furious backlash against the president's broadcast to the nation on Thursday, announcing work permits for migrants.

And analysts claim the policy - which has been months in the making - will not have the full economic benefits that widespread reforms passed through Congress would have delivered.

White House sources claim Obama wanted to make the announcement by the end of the summer but was blocked by Democrats fearing it could derail election hopes for candidates in conservative states.

It was days after the party conceded an overwhelming number of congressional seats to the Republicans that Obama - now a 'lame duck' president - finally put pen to paper.

Proponents of comprehensive reform cite the benefits compulsory work permits will provide for the economy.

'This is focused on people who are already in the economy today, who are contributing mightily but are basically operating in the shadows,' said Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. 'Their economic potential is being held back.'

The new order could boost labor income by $6.8 billion, helping to generate 160,000 new jobs and $2.5 billion in additional tax revenues, according to estimates by Hinojosa-Ojeda.

However, the president's order 'falls short of a comprehensive reform that would have a more sweeping effect on the economic landscape,' said Joel Prakken of the forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers.

More substantial reforms could lift economic growth by an additional 0.24 percent a year — or about $41 billion — for the next two decades, according to an analysis that Prakken contributed to last year for the Bipartisan Policy Center. 

Backlash: Analysts claim the move will not have the full economic impact that a bill would have delivered

The reforms could also cut the federal debt by $1.2 trillion over the same period, increase home construction, lift wages and add 8.3 million workers to the economy.

A broader overhaul would also create a framework for attracting more immigrants, which would mute the negative economic impacts of an aging population.

As more Americans retire, the percentage of the population with jobs has slipped, limiting the ability of the economy to expand.

Obama has also been criticized for simply protecting the current immigrant population, rather than promoting the immigration of more high-skilled workers.

Despite repeated calls to raise the 65,000 limit on 'H-1B' visas issued to skilled workers per year, this is not covered by the executive order.

Scientists, engineers and computer programmers all earn higher wages than the comparatively low-paid workers who would be helped by Obama.
