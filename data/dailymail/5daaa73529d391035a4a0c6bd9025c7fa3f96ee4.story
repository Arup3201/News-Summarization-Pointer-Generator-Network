The heavy rain and gale-force winds battering Britain have already started to affect the weekend's sports schedule, with three FA Cup ties and a race meeting postponed.

The third round match at The Valley between Championship side Charlton Athletic and League Two Oxford United was called off on Friday morning due to a waterlogged pitch.

The fixture will now be played this Wednesday at 7.45pm.

The one outstanding second round 
replay, between League One Crawley Town and League Two Bristol Rovers, 
was also postponed because of a saturated pitch.

The
original replay was abandoned during the second half because of heavy 
rain, so the teams will do battle for a third time on Wednesday night.

It means the third round tie at Birmingham City that awaited the winners on Tuesday will have to be pushed back.

The Bournemouth v Burton Albion tie was called off two hours before kick-off for the same reason.

Meanwhile, Portsmouth's League Two clash with Accrington at Fratton Park was also postponed due to a waterlogged pitch.

The decision was made after a Friday afternoon pitch inspection by local referee Andy Davies.

He told Portsmouth's official website: 'The pitch was very wet, with standing water in various areas.

'It's
barely playable at the moment, but we've also had to take into account 
the weather forecast, which is pretty dire for the next 24 hours.

'The pitch would therefore be unplayable and it would be dangerous for the players, which is our ultimate concern.'

Also in the fourth tier, the game at Whaddon Road between Cheltenham Town and Chesterfield was postponed following an early pitch inspection on Saturday morning.

Motherwell's Scottish Premiership match with Inverness has been postponed due to a waterlogged pitch at Fir Park.

The club made the announcement after 180mm of rain was recorded at the ground over the last 19 days.

Following a pitch inspection on Saturday morning by match official John Beaton, it was decided the pitch was unplayable.

'Motherwell Football Club would like to apologise for any inconvenience this postponement may cause,' the club said on its official website.

'No date has, as yet, been confirmed for the rearranged fixture.'

A number of non-league fixtures have also been postponed already, including the Skrill Conference Premier fixtures at Forest Green Rovers, Welling United and Woking.Â 

The National Hunt meeting at Wincanton has been abandoned due to a waterlogged track.

Like much of the country the Somerset track has been by heavy rain during the week, but clerk of the course Barry Johnson remained hopeful the fixture could beat the weather as he called an inspection for 7am.

However, even more rain than was forecast fell overnight and Johnson called off proceedings before the scheduled inspection time.

He said: 'We have already abandoned, I'm afraid.

'It's disappointing as the boys worked so hard on Friday and the track was raceable at 5pm. We thought at that stage the track could take a bit more rain, but we've had far more than forecast.

'We thought we might get six or seven millimetres, and we would probably have coped with that, but it started raining at 1.30am and it was torrential until 6am.

'We've had 14 millimetres of rain already and it's still raining, so unfortunately we've been beaten by the weather.'

With the Met Office issuing a number of weather warnings across the country, further postponements are likely and a number of football clubs will hold pitch inspections on Saturday morning.
