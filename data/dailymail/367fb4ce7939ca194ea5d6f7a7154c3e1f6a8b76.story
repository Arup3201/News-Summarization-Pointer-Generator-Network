Blade runner Jonnie Peacock is tipped to become Britain’s first Paralympics millionaire after his spectacular gold medal run into sporting history.

Six million people tuned in to watch the 19-year-old on Thursday night as he destroyed a star-studded field led by South African Oscar Pistorius to win the T44 100m in record time, cheered on by an 80,000-strong crowd.

Now, the baby-faced sprinter could become the nation’s highest-paid Paralympic athlete as sponsors rush to sign him up.

But yesterday the new superstar of British sport was playing down its significance.

Still wearing his gold medal, Peacock, whose right leg was amputated below the knee after he contracted meningitis as a five-year-old, seemed oblivious to his newfound fame, insisting: ‘I don’t think life’s going to change too much.

‘Maybe I’m naive, but I’m still going to go out to Nando’s with my mates. I think I will be able to go out without being noticed.’

Nigel Currie, a sports marketing expert, 
said the Cambridge-born athlete would become the new must-have ‘face’ 
for corporate sponsors.

He
said: ‘Peacock comes across very well in the media.

'There are big 
global opportunities for him which could realise him earnings of around 
£500,000 in the next 12 months alone.

’Peacock did not rule out the possibility 
of being selected for the 2016 Olympic games in Rio, making him the 
first British Paralympian to compete in the able-bodied Games.

He said: ‘Never say never, but it would be a lot harder because of the disadvantage at the start.’

Blade runners typically have a slower response time off the starting blocks than able-bodied athletes.

The
medal haul of Britain’s Paralympians passed 113 yesterday – the target 
for London 2012 had been 103 – with two days of competition to go.

That
included a bronze for cyclist Rachel Morris, 33, in the H1-3 road race 
at Brands Hatch, who was hit by a car while out training in July.

Morris
had hoped to share the bronze with her friend and training partner 
Karen Darke – the pair held hands as they crossed the finishing line 
together at the end of the 30-mile race.

But they reckoned without the photo-finish equipment, which showed Morris just ahead.

Britain’s first gold of the day had come in the Olympic stadium from Bristol-born Josie Pearson who broke the world record three times to claim victory in the F51 discus, an event she took up only 18 months ago.

The 26-year-old, who was paralysed from the chest down aged 17 after a car crash that killed her boyfriend, said: ‘I don’t think it will sink in for quite a long time.’
