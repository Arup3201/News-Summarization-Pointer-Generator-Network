Cried rape: Beverley Brandreth, 20, has been jailed for claiming her ex-boyfriend raped her twice and he was arrested on both occasions

A woman who falsely cried rape twice against her ex-boyfriend has been jailed.

Beverley Brandreth, 20, claimed that he had raped her while she was pregnant which made her lose a baby, a claim which was found to be untrue.

At the time prosecutors advised that no charge should be brought against her.

Then she made a second claim last November when she told police that he had dragged her into woods where she was beaten unconscious and raped, and he threatened to kill her if she reported the matter.

Her lies were unmasked again when the victim later proved he was in a DVD store with his new girlfriend when Brandreth claimed he attacked her.

The man she accused was arrested on both occasions and spent a total of 30 hours in custody, Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court heard.

He remained on bail for more than two months over the latest alleged offence before Brandreth, of Sharston, Manchester was arrested herself in January.

The defendant made no comment and only admitted not telling the truth when she entered a guilty plea in August to attempting to pervert the course of justice.

Sentencing her, Judge Bernard Lever said that ‘mercifully’ the accused man had been able to prove his innocence but he told Brandreth she ‘did not know that at the time you made this outrageous allegation against him’.

The sentencing comes after a woman 
who cried rape because she regretted having sex with three men at a 
drunken orgy has been jailed for two years for her ‘wicked’ lies in 
September.

Deceit: Rosie Dodd was jailed for two years for crying rape because she regretted having sex with three men at a drunken orgy

Rosie Dodd, 20, 
had been out drinking when she met the men, aged 25, 23, and 21, and 
started groping one of them on a bus on the way home.

She had sex with them one after the 
other, but after telling a friend she felt ‘dirty’ she lied to police 
that she had been raped.

The men, two of them students, then suffered a ‘nightmare’ involving intimate examinations and being locked up in cells.

But after police became concerned about inconsistencies in Dodd’s account, she admitted the encounters had been consensual.

In a separate incident, jilted Janet Higginbottom, 36, tried to frame her ex-lover for rape after he refused to rekindle their affair has been jailed.

Higginbottom got drunk and dialled 999 at 2am falsely claiming she had been stalked and then raped in the street after being followed home.

Manchester Crown Court heard how Higginbottom of  Broadbottom, Hyde, then identified her ex as the culprit, wrongly claiming he had fled in a car after the incident even though he was at home all the time. 

Higginbottom’s unnamed former boyfriend was later arrested in a 4am raid in front of his current girlfriend and held for 11 hours.
