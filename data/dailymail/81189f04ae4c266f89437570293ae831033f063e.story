West Ham midfielder Alex Song has revealed that he had hoped to return to Arsenal when he left Barcelona last summer, but Arsene Wenger didn't want him.

Song, who has been excellent since moving back to England, chose instead to join West Ham, while Arsenal declined to buy another holding player.

The Cameroonian claims that the same is true of Cesc Fabregas, who also wanted to re-join the Gunners, but instead moved to Chelsea.

'I would have liked to come back, but they didn't want me,' Song, who faces his old club for the first time as a West Ham player on Sunday, told L'Equipe. 'That's life. I'm not mad at them. 

'Cesc also wanted to come back to Arsenal, who did not want activate their buy-back clause. It was surprising. When I see what he is doing at Chelsea. He is even better than before!'

Song posed for West Ham's pre-match programme against Arsenal with a 'Nolan' tattoo evident on his left arm, comically reflecting his Hammers team-mate and club captain Kevin.

However, he in fact got the tattoo in tribute to his two-year-old son named Nolan.

'I could have played Champions League in Italy, with Napoli or Roma, in Turkey,' said Song.

'I could have played in France too, with Marseille. But my priority was to return to England. 

'For me as well as my family. We like it here. I have found a club that I didn't know very well but where things are going quite well.'
