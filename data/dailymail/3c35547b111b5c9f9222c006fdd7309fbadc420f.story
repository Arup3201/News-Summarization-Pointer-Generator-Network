The Today show's presenting team brought a bit of brightness to their viewers this morning, when they shared images of themselves as young children and placed them alongside pictures of their own kids, and their parents, in order to see the similarities in appearance between the different generations. 

Savannah Guthrie, Matt Lauer, Carson Daly, Al Roker, Tamron Hall and Natalie Morales all took part in the segment, which saw the hosts closely examining the remarkable resemblances between themselves and their family members. 

'Later in life you can start to look different, but back at that certain age there's that great resemblance,' father-of-three Carson Daly noted.

How things change: Matt still has the same cheeky smile, but the rest of his appearance has changed quite a bit

The generation game: Savannah Guthrie revealed an image of herself as a baby, alongside incredibly similar pictures of her newborn daughter Vale and her mother Nancy

Smile! Savannah has the same wide smile as she did when she was a baby

Inspired by The Huffington Post, which asked its readers to share comparative images of themselves and their children, the hosts kicked off with an image of Matt, 57, as a child, placed alongside a baby picture of his now-13-year-old son Jack.

The group were amazed to see how similar the two looked and quickly remarked on the most obvious features. 

Both father and son have the same bright, big eyes and adorable pout, while even the positioning of their ears appears to be near-identical. 

Similarly, pictures of Savannah Guthrie at the same age as her newborn baby daughter Vale showed an uncanny resemblance between the two chubby-cheeked children. 

An additional image of the TV host's mother Nancy demonstrated that the family resemblance remains across three generations.

'Get that hair!' Carson Daly shared a picture of his father, immediately prompting laughter from his co-hosts who insisted he steal his dad's slightly dated hairstyle

Family affair: Tamron Hall, 44, proved that the similarities are just as remarkable within her wider family, comparing an image of herself to pictures of her two nieces

'This is a cheeks thing,' the 43-year-old said of the photos. 'It's a big cheeks situation.' 

Savannah also managed to unearth a picture of herself at just six-weeks-old, showing that even at that young age, the similarities between her and her daughter are incredibly clear to see. 

A picture of 60-year-old Al's son Nick, 12, was compared with a slightly grainy black and white image of his father as a child.

But despite the fuzzy quality of the photo, the similarities in appearance between Al and his beloved son were clear for all to see. 

'That's a handsome boy,' Al said, before Savannah added: 'That's two handsome boys.' 

Al's fellow host Tamron, 44, shared a beautiful picture of herself as a child, alongside two images of her Gianna and Leila.

'Handsome boys': Al Roker, now 60, and his son Nick share the same cheeky grin

'Beautiful': Natalie Morales' co-hosts remarked how beautiful both she and her mother are

The three young girls pictured in the images could well be triplets given the remarkable similarities between them. 

Natalie Morales and Carson Daly opted to compare pictures of their parents with themselves as they are now, to prove that their family resemblance has managed to remain throughout their lifetimes. 

Carson showed a brilliant picture of his father, with his hosts remarking that the two looked 'identical', before joking that their co-host should copy his dad's slightly dated hairstyle. 

Meanwhile Natalie, 42, compared herself with a beautiful picture of her mother, saying: 'My mother is much younger than me in that picture.'

But her co-hosts were stunned to see how similar the two looked, with Savannah noting: 'You are both so beautiful.'
