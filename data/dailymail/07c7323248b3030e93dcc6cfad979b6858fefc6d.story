Recreational pole dancers have been branded prostitutes due to their alleged raunchy routines, which have forced them out of their studio by the affluent Melbourne community of Kew.

The fiery claims have started a war with outraged clients, who have been branded strippers and ‘undesirables’, insisting they are well-educated professionals who signed up to simply have fun.

Pole Princess owner Anastacia Snellesk says she is almost $100,000 out of pocket after the City of Boroondara council threw out her application to move the classes from Kew to Hawthorn East – but not until after she had signed a new lease, paid the rent and spent thousands of dollars on renovations.

‘I'm angry, I'm annoyed, I think it's ridiculous that someone won't find out what actually goes on before making such a terrible complaint,’ she told A Current Affair.

After running her business for eight years, the council received eight complaints involving parking, noise and a ‘pornographic’ sign - which is a picture of Ms Snellesk.

‘You can imagine how aghast we were to find a nine-foot colour photo of a stripper stuck to the front of our building one day,’ Justin Morris, who runs an architecture business upstairs, said.

‘We have had an onslaught of bad taste jokes from clients coming to our offices for meetings.’

Those that take part in Ms Snellesk's pole dancing classes are outraged by claims that the studio could attract ‘undesirables’ to the commercial area where young families visited.

'It all comes back to being uneducated. We are not strippers. I'm a mum,’ one class member said.

‘Our students, our staff, our teachers, everyone – we're all doctors, we're nurses, we're lawyers we're all walks of people and we are just here to have fun.’

Ms Snellesk vowed not to give in but said both the council and Mr Morris were not willing to cooperate.

‘I tried to negotiate with him and if he doesn't like the sign we'll take it down and whatever issues he had we will work with him and he didn't even respond,’ she said.

The council could not be reached for comment.
