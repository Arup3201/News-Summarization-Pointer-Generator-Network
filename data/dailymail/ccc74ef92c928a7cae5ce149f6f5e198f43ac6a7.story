Manny Pacquiao plans to make Floyd Mayweather Jnr dance to his tune on May 2, and the Filipino icon gave fans a sample of his entrance music as the pair came head to head in Los Angeles.

Pacquiao and Mayweather faced the world's media for the only time before fight week on Wednesday night as both men vowed to conquer the other in their $300million (£200m) Las Vegas showdown.

But before he took to the stage, Pacquiao delivered a rendition of 'I will fight for the Philippines', an unreleased track he has recorded for his walk on at the MGM Grand.

Pacquiao, who stands to make at least $120m from the fight, collaborated with Filipino singer/songwriter Lito Camo to produce the ballad.

Mayweather, meanwhile, is likely to be accompanied into the ring by pop star Justin Bieber who has long been part of his inflated entourage.

And the 38-year-old's entrance song will contrast sharply with his opponent's.

Mayweather prefers a rap number and was walked into the ring by Lil Wayne for his first fight against Marcos Maidana last year.
