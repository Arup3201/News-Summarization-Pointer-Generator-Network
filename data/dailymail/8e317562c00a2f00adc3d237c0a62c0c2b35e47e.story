UEFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against Italy and Croatia following Sunday’s match in Milan.

The 2016 European Championship qualifier at the San Siro was temporarily stopped in both halves by Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers after visiting fans threw fireworks and smoke bombs on to the pitch.

Charges of racist behaviour, crowd disturbances and the setting-off of fireworks and missiles have been levelled against the Croatian Football Federation. Italy have been charged as a result of setting off fireworks.

The case will be dealt with by UEFA’s Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body on December 11.

Antonio Candreva put the hosts ahead in the 11th minute when he scored his first international goal but Croatia’s Ivan Perisic equalised four minutes later.

The match finished 1-1 but the rhythm of the contest was subsequently broken up by events in the stands.

At one point, the players were taken off the pitch for 10 minutes by the referee.

The result left the two sides level on 10 points at the top of Group H after four games, with both teams having gone into the encounter on the back of three straight wins in qualifying.

Croatia coach Niko Kovac appeals for calm from the travelling fans and asks them to stop throwing flares
