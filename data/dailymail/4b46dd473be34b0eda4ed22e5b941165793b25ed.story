Boris Johnson distanced himself from David Cameron and George Osborne yesterday, saying he needs to be ‘different’ from the Government if he is to win the London mayoral race.

The Tory mayor initially refused to say the Prime Minister is a vote winner and made clear that he is prepared to go to war with the Chancellor to win more cash for the capital.

Polls show Mr Johnson on course for victory over Labour’s Ken Livingstone – but only because his personal popularity is streets ahead of the Tory party’s and because some Labour voters may back him.

Making a stand: Mr Johnson described David Cameron today as a 'vote winner'

In an interview yesterday, Mr Johnson did little to hide the fact that the Government’s recent troubles and the ‘omnishambles’ of the Budget have dragged him down.

He said: ‘People say am I different from the Conservative Party or am I different from the Government? The answer is “well yes”, in the sense that I will go in to bat for London.’

Mr Johnson offered only a lukewarm endorsement of Mr Cameron. Asked if the Prime Minister was a vote winner, he paused and then failed to answer the question. ‘I’m sure that all sorts of people win me votes or lose me votes,’ he said.

Pushed to take a stand, Mr Johnson said: ‘He’s obviously a vote winner.’

But he then made clear he is not standing on Mr Cameron’s policy platform. ‘This is something that is going to be decided on my programme for improving this city and taking London forward,’ he said.

‘I think people can see a very, very clear difference between our programme, my programme and what I am offering Londoners.’

Mr Johnson, who is seen as a future leadership rival for Mr Osborne, said: ‘I will go in to fight for London’s budgets. I will, I don’t care if plaster comes off the ceiling in the Treasury provided we get the funding we need.’ London goes to the polls tomorrow and the results will come in on Friday afternoon.

All 25 London Assembly seats are also up for grabs. The Tories are expected to lose their position as the biggest party in the Assembly.

A Populus poll yesterday found that Mr Johnson is on course for a 46 per cent to 34 per cent victory in the mayoral race, despite Tory support falling to 33 per cent in London.

While Labour has 44 per cent support in the capital, Mr Livingstone is performing 12 points worse than his party.
