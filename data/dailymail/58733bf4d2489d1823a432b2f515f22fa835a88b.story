Last year’s Playmate of the Year, who was allegedly kicked and punched by Hugh Hefner’s 21-year-old-son Marston is severing ties with Playboy until the domestic violence case is settled.

TMZ revealed that 20-year-old Clair Sinclair has cleared her schedule of all Playboy-related events, including photo shoots, appearances, and events.

It is possible that Miss Sinclair could return to Playboy after the case is resolved, TMZ notes.

Miss Sinclair said she wouldn’t press charges on her boyfriend if he apologised publically and received psychiatric treatment.

Investigators, meanwhile, are looking into the alleged attack.

The model told TMZ on February 14 that
she was granted a five-day stay-away order so that she could move out 
of the apartment she shares with Marston Hefner, 21.

Police sources later said the injunction was valid for three days.

Miss Sinclair was later photographed with a large bruise on her arm while taking some of her belongings out of the Pasadena apartment.

Marston Hefner, 21, reportedly kicked Miss Sinclair and punched her in the stomach during a fight the couple had late last Sunday night.

Police responded to the residence after receiving worried calls from Miss Sinclair's family.

Marston Hefner reportedly told police that the two had been arguing but that he had not physically injured his girlfriend.

Hefner was arrested for misdemeanor domestic violence but released on $20,000 bail.

Miss Sinclair was the Playboy official pin-up and Playmate of the year 2011.

Among the many, many women the Playboy tycoon has dated, are:

- Kimberley Conrad: Playmate of year 1989; wife from 1989 - 2010; mother of his sons Cooper and Marston

- Brande Roderick: Playmate of the year 2001; Baywatch actress

- Tina Marie Jordan: Playmate of the month, March 2002

- Crystal Harris: Playmate of the month, December 2009; due to become Hefner's third wife before she broke off the engagement five days before the wedding last year

Hugh Hefner told Fox News that Miss Sinclair's style reminded him of Bettie Page - a popular 1950s pinup model who was also Playboy Magazine's Miss January cover model in 1955.

Miss Sinclair has been dating Marston Hefner since August 2010.

She was born in 1991 in Los 
Angeles and has been modelling since the age of 14.

She has taken part 
in fashion campaigns for Angel Jeans and stars on Playboy TV. 

She told Maximo TV last year that she and Marston Hefner had a 'tumultuous' relationship.

Marston Hefner's mother Kimberley 
Conrad, is the ex-wife of Hugh Hefner and Playmate of the Year 1989.

Ms 
Conrad was married to Hugh Hefner between 1989 and 2010.

Marston
was born on April 9, 1990 and shares the same birthday as his father 
Hugh.

He has a younger brother Cooper Bradford Hefner who was born on 
September 4, 1991.

According to his Twitter page, Marston Hefner is a philosophy college major who also studies business and writing.

In 
an interview with GQ in 2008, then 18-year-old Marston said: 'My, like, 
expectancy for what girl I'm going to get is, like, so f*****-up.

'I've 
just been around really hot women my entire life, so the average high 
school girl won't do it for me.'
