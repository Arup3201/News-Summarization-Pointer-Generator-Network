A teenager convicted of attempted murder and stealing celebrity chef Guy Fieri's Lamborghini was sentenced to 21 years in prison yesterday.

Max Wade, 19, stole the TV cook's $200,000 convertible in a 'Mission-Impossible-style' heist in 2011 in a bid to woo pretty blonde Eva Dedier, then 17.

But when she spurned his advances, Wade tried to kill her and her new boyfriend in a failed drive-by shooting a year later.

The celebrity chef¿s bright-yellow Lamborghini was worth $800,000 and was missing for over 18 months

He was charged in Marin County Superior Court as an adult even though 
he was under 18 at the time the crimes were committed, the paper said.

The court heard how Wade rappelled into British Motors in 2011 and stole the $200,000 car while it was in the dealership for repairs.

Wade
 was also found guilty of attempted murder and firing a gun into an 
occupied vehicle in an unrelated drive-by shooting of a man who was 
dating a girl Wade desired. The man wasn't injured.

Marin County prosecutor Yvette 
Martinez said Wade had stolen the yellow Lamborghini to impress the girl
 and was willing to kill to get her attention.

Wade pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.

Detectives
 testified during the trial that they found the gun used in the 
shooting, two assault weapons and shotgun shells, as well as climbing 
gear.

Fieri, a star of Food 
Network, testified during the trial that he had never met Wade and never
 gave him permission to drive his car.

The
 teen made news again last year after at least two people tried to break
 into Marin County's juvenile hall with sledgehammers in an unsuccessful
 attempt to free him.

Authorities
 took extra measures to ensure security in the courtroom during the 
trial, keeping Wade tethered to a chair bolted to the floor.

Fieri
 appeared in court as a witness during the case, testifying for just a 
few minutes to confirm that he did not know the teen nor did he give him
 permission to take the luxury car out of the dealership.

Prosecutors allege that Wade stole the car in a ‘Mission Impossible’-style heist to impress the girl, Eva Dedier, who is now 19.

Then in April 2012 he attempted to kill Dedier and her former boyfriend, Landon Wahlstrom, as they sat in Wahlstrom’s truck.

That
 investigation led authorities to Wade's storage container in Richmond, 
where they found the Food Network star's stolen yellow Lamborghini.

Fieri told reporters outside of court that he is relieved the ordeal is nearly over. ‘It's been a really crazy story,’ he said.

During the 18 month period that the car, Fieri said he constantly received calls from people who had spotted the vehicle being driven around the Bay Area

He had been in Chicago filming his 
show ‘Dives, Diners and Drive-ins’ for the Food Network when he heard 
the car had been stolen.

‘I thought it was a bad joke,’ Fieri told NBC Bay Area.

During the 18 month period that the car, the chef said he constantly received calls from people who had spotted the vehicle.

Fieri said he thought Wade’s story would make a great movie.

‘I'm
 sorry to see laws get broken,’ Fieri said. ‘This has so many other 
facets that are far more important than my car. My car is a very small 
portion of it. There's a bigger issue on the table.’

He said the insurance company took ownership of the car after it was found in Wade's possession at a storage unit.
