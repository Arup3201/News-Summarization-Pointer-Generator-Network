Exploding head syndrome may sound like a made-up condition - in fact, it's a real
 and frightening medical disorder, and one that a study suggests is 
surprisingly common.

People with exploding head syndrome (EHS) hear loud noises when going to sleep or on waking up. The
 type of noise can vary from explosions and fireworks to slammed doors, 
the sound of a gun firing, an enormous roar, shouting, thunder or a 
crack of lightning. The noises start suddenly and last for a few 
seconds.

Before hearing the loud noise, one in ten also has visual 
disturbances, such as seeing lightning or flashes. These are similar to 
the auras some people have before a migraine headache.

'In contrast 
to migraine, visual symptoms are brief - typically a single flash,' says
 Dr Nicholas Silver, a consultant neurologist at the Walton Centre NHS 
Foundation, Liverpool.

Exploding head syndrome may also cause a mild
 headache and sensations of heat; other symptoms include a jerk or 
'jumping' limbs at the same time.

While some have only one attack in
 their life, others experience up to seven a night. They may come and go
 over weeks or months, though for some they occur almost daily for 
years.

It can lead to sleeping problems and worse: an attack may 
cause temporary tachycardia - a faster heart rate than normal - and 
palpitations.

In the longer term it can also lead to panic disorder,
 depression and catastrophising, where patients misinterpret symptoms as
 signs of more serious conditions, such as a stroke.

'I have 
assessed patients reporting apprehension who avoid sleep during chronic 
bouts of EHS,' says Dr Brian Sharpless, an assistant professor  of 
psychology at Washington  State University. 'It can be very frightening 
and scary for those who do not know what is happening.'

And a study 
published in the journal Sleep Medicine Reviews suggests that the 
disorder may affect as many as one in ten people at some time during 
their life.

'It has been claimed that EHS is rare, but preliminary 
data does not appear to imply rarity,' says Dr Sharpless, who led the 
study.

The disorder is known to be twice as common in women and 
typically affects the over-50s, though it has also been reported in 
children as young as ten.

Quite why it occurs is not clear. One 
theory is that it is caused by ear problems, especially those affecting 
the eustachian tube, which links the middle ear with the back of the 
nose and throat.

Problems here can affect air pressure in the middle ear, which can cause the perception of sounds when there are none.

Exploding
 head syndrome is also linked to rapid withdrawal from certain drugs 
such as benzodiazepines, given for anxiety or sleeping problems, or 
anti-depressants called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors.

However,
 Dr Sharpless says the most likely explanation  is that there is some 
kind of temporary blip in the nerve cells of the brain during the switch
 from being awake to sleeping.

When we go to sleep, the brain 
orchestrates a switching off of various regions responsible for 
movement, vision, sound and so on. It's thought that EHS occurs because 
of a delay in this shut-down, resulting in a burst of activity - this is
 perceived as loud noises and flashes of light.

Yet even though it was identified 150 years ago, researchers say EHS remains little known.

'It
 is an entirely benign and non-threatening condition,' says Dr Silver. 
However, lack of awareness means it's often misdiagnosed, as 
'night-time' epilepsy, thunder-clap headaches - sudden, severe pain that
 peaks within 60 seconds - or nightmare disorder, where people often 
wake with detailed recall of frightening dreams.

It is also 
misdiagnosed as migraine, cluster headaches - severe pain on one side, 
often behind the eye - and post-traumatic stress disorder flashbacks.

'Because
 a diagnosis of EHS does not occur to a lot of doctors, it is not 
uncommon to see patients having investigations to rule out disorders 
such as subarachnoid haemorrhage (sudden bleeding around the brain) or 
epilepsy,' says Dr Silver.

Patients may be given scans  or even a 
lumbar puncture - where a needle is used to remove spinal fluid to check
 for subarachnoid haemorrhage.

'My main concern is the lack of 
recognition of this disorder among the public, but also possibly among 
the medical profession  as it does not feature highly in standard 
textbooks on medicine or neurology,' says Dr Silver.

He stresses the
 importance of educating doctors who have not come across EHS - 'so 
patients with this syndrome are not put through probable unnecessary 
scans or lumbar punctures'.

'As with most neurological conditions, 
diagnosis relies on taking a good history from the patient and excluding
 more worrisome possibilities.'

For without a diagnosis, people with EHS will also miss out on receiving proper treatment.

The good news, says Dr Sharpless, is that while EHS can be scary, it is generally harmless.

'Any
 problems tend to be because of the way people react to episodes, such 
as misinterpreting them as indicative of  a more serious condition, or 
avoiding sleep.'

Most patients simply require reassurance. 'I find 
lifestyle advice, for instance avoiding caffeine before bed, is all they
 need,' says Dr Silver.

There are drug treatments that may be 
effective, including the antidepressant clomipramine, calcium 
channel-blockers and anticonvulsants - typically used for epilepsy - 
though it's not clear how these work.

'Drug treatment is reserved for those with frequent symptoms,' says Dr Silver.
