These extraordinary images from a tiny island in frigid Antarctica show one penguin’s desperate search for his soul-mate.

The touching scenes from Devil’s Island mirror the plight of Monty the penguin in the John Lewis Christmas advert.

Tourist Adam Gibbs managed to capture the lonely Adelie penguin's hunt for love during his journey to the Antarctic Peninsula to photograph glaciers.

It's real love: This is the heart-warming moment the penguins share a kiss with each other on Devil's Island in Antarctica

The adorable penguin cuts a lonely figure standing alone on a solitary iceberg, looking out to the horizon in search of a mate, just like Monty.

The flightless bird is photographed waddling along the icy coastline, pining for a mate, and in one shot even appears to lift his gaze to the heavens in a plea for help.

Time to fly: The male penguin started running and diving across blocks of melting ice to find his mate

But before long, the male penguin started running and diving across blocks of melting ice to get to a second iceberg - where he is united with his partner.

The pair then have a heart-warming encounter, before being snapped swimming together and even appearing to stroll flipper-in-flipper along the surf.

Final approach: The male penguin hops onto an iceberg moments before a heart-warming encounter with his female partner

Happy feet: Photographer Adam Gibbs, from British Columbia in Canada, said the courtship was a 'really sweet scene'

Penguins are one of the few species on earth which mate for life.

Adam, who lives in the Canadian province of British Columbia, said: ‘It was a really sweet scene.

‘As soon as I saw the Monty advert online it immediately reminded me of the penguins I'd photographed.’
