Scandal-plagued former French presidential hopeful Dominique Strauss-Kahn has been branded the ‘king of the pigs’ in an explosive book written by an embittered ex-lover.

Argentine lawyer Marcela Iacub claimed the disgraced ex-International Monetary Fund chief would have turned the Elysee Palace into a ‘swingers’ club’ if he’d been elected president.

The 48-year-old legal expert said she had a steamy seven-month affair with Strauss-Kahn, 64, after he was cleared of raping a maid at a New York hotel.

Scathing: In her lurid memoir Beauty and the Beast (above), she claims the disgraced ex-International Monetary Fund chief would have turned the Elysee Palace into a 'swingers' club' if he'd been elected president

In excerpts of her lurid memoir ‘Beauty and the Beast’ published in France yesterday, she claimed that had he become the French president, he would have ‘used your assistants, henchmen, advisers and staff as touts, orgy organisers, experts in the art of satisfying your darkest urges.'

‘You claimed that you were ready to give your blood for your country when in fact you would have used this country to spill your inexhaustible sperm,’ she added in an open letter to her former lover.

After meeting Mr Strauss-Kahn in January last year, Miss Iacub said she fell completely in love with the man she described as the ‘king of the pigs’ and ‘half man, half pig.’

‘Pigs have a relationship with the present that humans hardly have. They never cease relishing the incredible luck of being alive, eating, running, sullying, wounding, feeling.’

Withering: Miss Iacub also turns on Strauss-Kahn's estranged wife, Anne Sinclair (left), whom she claims dreamt of being First Lady and treated her husband like a 'poodle'

‘You have had a long list of sexual conquests ... of mostly vulgar and unattractive women,’ she wrote.

‘It is one of the authentic and wonderful traits of the true pig, a form of generosity that you show to all women prepared to receive you.’

The pair met in January 2012 after Miss Iacub wrote an essay defending Strauss-Kahn.

He subsequently texted her: ‘You who like writing, tell me what you want to do with me later.’ 

In love: The 48-year-old legal expert said she had an affair with DSK after he was cleared of raping Nafissatou Diallo (pictured) at a New York hotel

There followed a seven-month affair in which Miss Iacub said she fell totally in love.

Miss Iacub saves her fiercest words for Strauss Kahn’s estranged wife, Anne Sinclair, whom she claims dreamt of being First Lady and thought she and her husband ‘belonged to the caste of the masters of the world’.

She says she treated her husband like ‘a poodle’.

The claims drew a furious response from both Mr Strauss-Kahn and Miss Sinclair.

Strauss-Kahn said he felt ‘doubly disgusted’ by the ‘inaccurate’ account of their relationship.

‘Disgusted
that a woman would seduce a man with the sole intention of writing a 
book about it, of feigning love for financial gain, for selling her 
story through a press she has always been critical of,’ he wrote to Le 
Nouvel Observateur, the left-wing French magazine that printed the 
excerpts.

In a separate 
response, Miss Sinclair told Le Nouvel Observateur: ‘You give credit to 
the manoeuvres of a perverse and dishonest woman, driven by a 
fascination for the sensational and the lure of money.’

Strauss-Kahn
was accused of rape by New York hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo in May 
2011.

The Frenchman was cleared of criminal charges because of doubts 
over the maid’s account.

But Strauss-Kahn still faces up to 20 years in prison over his alleged role in a French sex vice racket.
