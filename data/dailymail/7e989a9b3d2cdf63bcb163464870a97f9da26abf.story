Los Angeles is known for its film industry, but one local festival has celebrated a rather interesting selection of stars from the big screen.

The Feline Film Festival film showcases the cats who have found fame around the world and it was attended by 10,000 feline fans on Sunday, who queued for hours at a time to meet the furry stars.

From Lil Bub, the permanent kitten that pokes its tongue out, to Tara the Hero Cat and Dusty the Klepto Cat, these felines have everything from clothing lines to book deals.

The large number of fans had an opportunity to see cat videos, watch cat costume contests and meet internet star Lil Bub, who has her own clothing line and book tour.

The festival was the brainchild of Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and it was organised by eco-friendly cat product producers Organikat.

In the one minute 16 second video of the event a fan says she was over the moon to have a chance to meet her favourite cat. 'I'm willing to wait a couple of hours at least, it's not too bad. She's really cute.'

The woman says she would like if her own cats could one day be famous and well-known like Lil Bub. She adds: 'I think it would be kind of cool for my cats to be internet celebrity cats and make somebody pay for their litter and food.' 

Cat enthusiasts were everywhere as people with feline t-shirts and whiskers drawn onto their faces congregated around their favourite cats while  a cat naming competition also took place.

Feline Film Festival director Erik DeLeo told the LA Times that the cats were worshipped by their fans.

Mr DeLeo says: 'Cats are experiencing a second renaissance. Not since the ancient Egyptians in recorded history have cats been worshipped like they are today.' 

The festival was organised by eco-friendly cat product producers Organikat and it ran from 1pm until 10pm.

A number of other feline-inspired attractions such as beer tents, food trucks, live music and cat friendly vendors, one of which supplied yoga mats for cats were also on site.
