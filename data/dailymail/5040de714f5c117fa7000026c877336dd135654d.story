Liverpool are keen to add Barcelona and Spain forward Pedro to their ranks this summer, as Brendan Rodgers continues to plan for the dual challenge of Premier League and Champions League football next season according to the Daily Mirror.

The Reds have already been heavily linked with Southampton's Adam Lallana, although no deal is likely for the England international until after the World Cup.

But with Rodgers determined to add as many as five players to his squad he has already turned his attention to strengthening other positions.

In demand: Barcelona and Spain attacker Pedro has emerged as a target for Liverpool

Overhaul: The 26-year-old could be moved on from Camp Nou by new manager Luis Enrique

Pedro, 26, will help Spain defend their position as world champions in Brazil this summer, but faces an uncertain future at club level following the appointment of Luis Enrique as Barcelona manager.

Enrique revealed at his official unveiling as Barca boss he will make wholesale changes at the club this summer after a disastrous campaign which ended trophyless.

He said: 'The players must know that you cannot let a year pass at Barca. If they are not at the level required then there will be changes.

'We will reinforce the team in the best way possible, to be as competitive as possible. There is a market there - teams ask a lot of money for players. You must manage it all. We will reinforce, maybe in all lines of the team, to have the best players for the club and for me.

'I do not want to talk too much about individuals. Good and important players will stay. We will look at everyone and then see what we do. We do not have to make decisions now. We have time.'

Versatile: Pedro offers options as he can play comfortably in any position across the attack

Targets: Rodgers is already hard at work assessing potential Liverpool players for next season

Pedro, who has spent his whole career at Barcelona winning four league titles and two Champions Leagues, would fit perfectly into Liverpool's style of play.

Versatile enough to play across all three attacking positions he also fits the bill of the calibre of player that Rodgers has designs on.

Following the 4-0 friendly victory over Shamrock Rovers on May 14, the Reds boss said: 'Our criteria that we look for is players with strong technique and football intelligence.

'You'll get some players who are specialists and who need to play in particular positions, but if we can get players in who are multi-functional, and can play in different roles and are multi-dimensional in their work, it sets us up and gives me more options as a coach.'

Liverpool will be keen to tie up a deal for the player before the World Cup in order to avoid his value soaring should he perform well.

Pedro has scored 14 goals in 37 games for La Roja, and was part of the team that won the World Cup in 2010 and the European Championship in 2012.
