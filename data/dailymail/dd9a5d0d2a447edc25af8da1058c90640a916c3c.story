An astonishing collection of letters written by future kings Edward and George reveal the princes' 'heartbreak' at not being allowed to fight in WWI.

In the candid correspondence, the future King Edward VIII bemoans having to 'stay with the women' while others fought in the trenches after being banned from entering conflict as he was heir to the throne.

His younger brother, the future George VI, who was held back from active service by doctors after suffering gastric problems, meanwhile feared peers would blame his renowned stammer for his staying out of the line of fire. 

In the astonishing collection of letters princes Edward and George bemoan having to stay at home while others fought in the trenches in WWI

In one letter written by George to Admiral Tait on October 19 1914, the royal says he agrees with his advice not to return to H.M.S. Collingwood after being injured 

The letters, written between 1912 and 1932 on Bucking Palace letter-headed paper, were sent to Admiral Sir William Campbell Tait who served as the royals' mentor during the First World War. 

In one, written by Edward on August 5, 1914, the prince tells of his envy of servicemen on the front line.

'Oh god!! How I envy you all on active service, ready to deliver to those bloody Germans what I hope and am confident will be their death blow!!

'While you are all out, undergoing hardships and risking your lives, here am I left at home with the women, totally devoid of any job.

He continues: 'It is breaking my heart, almost, this feeling of being left out of it is becoming intolerable!!!' 

'However I have no right to bother you with my small troubles in such critical times as these; but we have known each other so well that I can't refrain from speaking out and giving vent to my feelings which are absolutely genuine!!'. 

Another letter from George describes an abscess removed from his navel 'much to his relief'  

In another, the prince, who was known to his family as Albert, describes keeping himself entertained while recovering from illness. He writes: 'I have plenty to do here, what with books, papers and letter writing' 

A letter on September 17th George writes: 'I am very glad that my operation is now over and it went off most satisfactory'

The collection has been lovingly restored by Admiral Tait's family who had all the letters bound in books

When he was banned from undertaking active service by Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchner, Edward VIII had already joined the Grenadier Guards. 

But, eager to be a part of the historic war and boost soldiers' morale, he visited the front line on several occasion, taking a camera with him to document his outings. 

Aged 21 at the time, he visited France several times and became popular in the trenches. 

George, meanwhile, had intended to fight the war out. 

After passing out at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, he served as a midshipman on H.M.S Collingwood. 

To the envy of his brother, he saw the Battle of Jutland in 1916, but was withdrawn shortly afterwards with an ulcer. 

In 1919, he joined the RAF and was a certified pilot.  

On September 13, he wrote: 'I am very depressed again. It is astounding to think that I have a commission in both services (Army and Navy) and I am denied seeing active service in either. 

'I can assure you I am a broken man.'

Edward joined the Grenadier Guards during the war but was not allowed to seek active service as the direct heir to the throne. 

Throughout the Twenties he undertook foreign tours of the empire and, in the early 1930s, visited deprived areas in Britain. 

His shock abdication in 1936 to marry divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson inducted his younger brother George to the throne. 

Writing before either of the brothers had become king, George's letter revealed a softer, more concerned personality than his boisterous older brother. 

After suffering severe gastric problems, doctors ordered the royal could not undertake active service. 

His own letters to Admiral Tait reveal his fear of being criticised by the public for not fighting on the front line. 

After taking part in the Battle of Jutland in 1916, he was withdrawn from active service with an ulcer.

In one letter, he writes: 'I quite agree with what you say about my returning to the ship.

'It is no good running the risk of opening the wound as then I should have to leave the one and only service there is.

'There has been quite a fuss about my injury

'Treves is writing a report for the papers which will stop any unpleasant remarks passed by people about what I am doing at home for so long.'

After the war, he writes again to Admiral Tait to gush about his new bride, the Queen Mother, who he describes as 'the most wonderful little person'.   

He also describes his shyness and fear of public speaking - made famous in the film The King's Speech - and talks of 'breathing properly and having confidence' in oneself'. 

The letters have been made available by the family of Admiral Tait, and are being sold at auctioneers Martel Maides in Guernsey for an estimated £45,000.  

Within the correspondence also lies reference to the notorious Bullingdon Club, the exclusive drinking club for Oxford University students which David Cameron and Boris Johnson were both members of during their time studying. 

In one letter, Edward, who attended Magdalene College after being withdrawn from naval college, wrote: 'Everyone drank everybody else's health at least 10 times and so you can imagine how persistent it was, there being 100 of us present. 

'Shouting and yelling never ceased and the amount of port consumed was astounding.' 

James Bridges, of Martel Maides, said: “The art of letter writing is drying up. Such a collection of letters would not exist today.

'I would be surprised if the two prices wrote letters of the length and style in the way that they used to be now.

'It was hugely exciting to have the collection in their upcoming sale.

'Letters like these are totally alien to a modern generation. Nothing like this has ever come to the market before.

'It is quite extraordinary for such a personal collection of letters to be outside the Royal Collection. They give a real flavour of the characters of the two princes.

'It is an extremely important archive two of the most significant members of the Royal Family in the 20th century.' 

The letters will go on sale at Martel Maides in Guernsey on October 2. 

As the documents reveal, both princes Edward and George vied to fight for Britain during WWI. 

Similarly, Princes William and Harry have both expressed their desire to serve on the front line. 

Much like his ancestor Edward, Prince William was kept back from the front line while serving in the RAF. 

In 2009 the Duke of Cambridge revealed his disappointment at not being allowed to fight, saying: 'I didn't join the forces to be mollycoddled or treated any differently. As far as I am concerned, in my eyes, if Harry can do it, then I can do it.

'As a future head of the Armed Forces it's really important you at least get the opportunity to be credible and to do the job I signed up for the best I can. 

'That's all I have ever wanted.' 

Prince Harry however completed a four-month tour of Afghanistan in 2013.

The fourth-in-line to the throne last year revealed he had killed in combat, saying: 'If there's people trying to do bad stuff to our guys, then we'll take them out of the game, I suppose'. 

A previous tour to the war-torn country was cancelled amid 'serious threats' to the young royal.
