Mitchell Elliott - former pub landlord and rogue trader who killed himself while awaiting fraud trial - pictured in 2010 facing trial for sexual assault

A businessman was found hanged at his home as he was due to stand trial for nine counts of fraud after being exposed on BBC’s Watchdog.

Mitchell Elliott, 40, from Gloucester faced trial for fraud and deception after his appearance on the show had led to an investigation into his TV-aerial and satellite business.

A coroners inquest heard how further complaints in the aftermath of the Rogue Traders episode, aired in 2009, destroyed the business and drove him into depression and drink.

Mr Elliott had previously been given a two year suspended jail-term for forcing himself on a woman’s foot.

The incident occurred when he was the landlord of the Bugatti Inn pub in Gloustershire.

He was convicted of sexual assault in 2010 and after the attack became common knowledge trade disappeared and he was forced to sell the pub at a loss.

After a suicide attempt in 2011 his GP requested a psychiatric evaluation which concluded that he would not attempt to take his own life because of his children.

Elliott faced nine charges of dishonestly making false representations between November 17, 2009 and September 27, 2010, committed before his trial for sexual assault.

The BBC Rogue Traders show exposed his fraudulent business as they carried out unnecessary work and charged customers for products they did not need.

When the presenters posed as complaining 
customers, Mitchell Elliott, who was the director of both companies 
under investigation by the show, was taped making 
threatening remarks before carrying on saying presenter Matt Allwright 
should hang up ‘for his own sake’.

Mitchell Elliott's fraudulent ways and bad customer service was exposed by Watchdog's Rogue Traders presenters Dan Penteado and Matt Allwright in 2009 which led to the decline of his businesses

As presenters asked for him by name he claimed that 'Mitchell Elliott' was killed in 2007, and that his name was Mark Jones, secretary of a new company that has taken over the dissolved Aerial Problems Solved Ltd.

When contacted by a local paper after the BBC expose he claimed he had been abroad and had not had anything to do with the company since 2008.

At the inquest, Deputy Assistant Gloucestershire Coroner Katy Skerrett heard Mr Elliott was found by his mother and a family friend on October 17 last year after members of his family had been unable to contact him for two days.

Patrick Beanes, a family friend, and his mother Pauline, went to his house which was locked with a security chain.

Mr Beanes said: ‘I broke in and saw Mitchell hanging from the bannisters.'

Mr Elliott’s GP Stephen Steinhart said he had suffered from low mood and depression in 2010 - a reaction to his declining business.

‘He had thoughts as to whether life was worth living but said he would not harm himself,'

‘He was then admitted to hospital after taking an overdose of drink and pills. His business went into liquidation in August 2011 and there was another impending court case.’

The toxicology report concluded that he had one and a half times the drink drive limit of alcohol, and had used cocaine not long before his death, although police found nothing suspicious in his Gloucester home.

Gloucester Country Council Trading Standards investigated Mr Elliott in 2009 but has been unable to comments.
