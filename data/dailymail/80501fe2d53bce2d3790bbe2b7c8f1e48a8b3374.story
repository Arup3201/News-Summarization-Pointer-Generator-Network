Lydia Rose Bright shot to fame on The Only Way Is Essex as Lauren Goodger’s sidekick with a penchant for peroxide blonde hair extensions, fake tan and micro pigs.

But fast-forward three years and the 23-year-old says she has ditched her make-up bag - and is encouraging other women to do the same. 

Lydia Bright is working with St Ives to encourage young women to strip back their make-up, have the confidence to bare all and embrace their natural beauty.

Lydia stars in a new shoot for the beauty brand which saw over 35 make-up products being applied to her face by three make-up artists using 30 brushes over the course of almost two hours to demonstrate what an average week's worth of make-up really looks like.

She then removed all of her make-up to convey the difference between heavily made-up and fresh-faced. 

Before the shoot, Lydia used St. Ives facial scrubs three to four times a week, to ensure her skin was perfectly prepped and radiant.

Obviously being from Essex, Lydia is well aware that she and her TOWIE co-stars are famed for their love of fake tan, false eyelashes and hair extensions.

'We are a glam bunch and image is a huge part of our lives and when the camera is rolling, we want to look as good as possible,' she told MailOnline.

'But all the cast loves nothing more than getting home and taking over their gel nails and make-up.'

Lydia says she hopes to encourage other women to embrace a more natural look- and says men prefer it

Lydia says she tries to ditch the make-up four days a week, especially when she's running errands or attending meetings.

She said: 'I am a total girly girl and when I'm filming TOWIE, I get glammed up but I actually try to go bare as much as possible when I'm not on camera,' she said.

'I hope that my involvement will encourage other women to follow my lead, wear less make-up and embrace their natural beauty. I want this to show women that you can look better without make-up.'

Another reason Lydia believes that bare-faced is best is because men prefer it.

'James used to hate it when I wore red lipstick because we couldn't kiss. I think men like a girl who takes good care of herself and visits the salon weekly to get her nails done and has her hair done monthly. It's important to take pride in your appearance but men don't want a girl who masks herself in make-up, they want to take her home and not have their parents judging her.' 

The newly natural star says she admires Millie Mackintosh's look because, she says, the former Made In Chelsea star nails the natural look and always looks beautiful.

The shoot saw Lydia stripped off an entire weeks worth of make-up by a team of make-up artists 

Lydia's belief that men don't like women to mask themselves with make-up is supported by a study in which too much cosmetics was named as the top turn off by 45 per cent of men

'She's probably got loads of products on but she always looks so flawless,' she said.

The campaign is launched as a new study, commissioned by St Ives, reveals that two thirds of British women mistakenly think men prefer them to wear plenty of make-up.

Half of women do their make-up almost 1,500 times a year - and two thirds go just three and a half weeks a year without wearing any slap, researchers found.

Almost one in ten women admit they wear make-up solely to impress the opposite sex.

But their cosmetics could well hinder their love lives as three quarters of men say they actually prefer girls who adopt a more natural look.

And 39 per cent think most women wear too much make-up and would rather they tone down their usage, with 45 per cent citing too much slap as the biggest turn off. 

Aside from her duties with St. Ives, Lydia has been busy designing her SS15 fashion range and says she plans to expand into daywear, on top of her successful line of party dresses.

And while she calls the bright lights of Loughton her home, Lydia's family actually hail from a tiny village in Italy.

'Me and my mum are off to Italy to see my relatives in my time off air. My ancestors were monks and my grandfather was the only one to leave the village ever so we are the only tourists who ever visit.

'I haven't been there for four years so they haven't seen me since I've joined TOWIE - they have no idea how much has changed!.'
