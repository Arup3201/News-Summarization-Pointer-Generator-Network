Developers have unveiled plans for a new £2billion Paramount theme park in Britain to rival Disneyland Paris.

The proposed development would create up to 27,000 jobs and transform an 872-acre brownfield site in the Swanscombe Peninsula in Kent.

The 'world-class' venue will feature Europe’s largest indoor 
water park, theatres, live music venues, attractions, cinemas, 
restaurants, event space and hotels and, if given the green light, will be 
twice the size of Olympic Park in East London.

Attraction: Developers have unveiled plans to build one of the biggest theme parks in the world in Britain. The £2bn, 872-acre entertainment complex will create 27,000 jobs

Potential: The proposed site for the theme park is currently an overgrown wasteland

Brownfield: Is this the next hot European leisure destination?

The ambitious resort will be located in the Swanscombe Peninsula in Kent, currently a brownfield site

The site is on the doorstep of Ebbsfleet International railway station, which is 17 minutes from London and two hours from Paris.

Tony Sefton, project leader for the development company London Resort Company Holdings (LRCH), said the plans were Britain’s biggest post-Olympic project and will take six years to build.

'Our vision is to create a world-class entertainment destination, the first of its kind in the UK,' he said.

'We are at the start of a long journey, but have been encouraged by the support and buy-in we have had to date.

'We are particularly pleased with the
 appetite we are seeing from investors, who consider this a compelling 
investment proposition.

'Over the next 12-18 months we will 
be progressing the planning application, while embarking on a 
wide-reaching programme of community consultation, while securing 
further commercial agreements with third parties.

'Our
 timetable for delivery, including the planning application process and 
construction timetable, is geared towards completion and opening in 
2018.'

LRCH has signed an 
agreement with Paramount Licensing Inc, the licensing division of 
Paramount Pictures, to give exclusive UK licensing for a Paramount 
entertainment resort at the heart of the site.

LRCH is also in negotiations with a range of major British brands to sign licensing agreements.

Dartford and Gravesham Borough Councils have both offered support for the project.

In a joint statement, Jeremy Kite, leader of Dartford Borough Council, and John Burden, leader of Gravesham Borough Council, said: 'This development represents a tremendous economic growth opportunity for the region.'

There is no indication yet as to which of Paramount's films
might form the basis for any of the theme park's attractions.

However, with such a huge library of films - the company is celebrating its centenary - it has produced,
co-produced or has distribution rights for, it could call on any number of hit
films to bring visitors flocking.

The Indiana Jones series and Transformers, both distributed
by Paramount, would be provide ideal themes for rides too.

In particular the mine chase from Temple of Doom could offer
an experience similar to Disneyland’s Thunder Mountain runaway train.

To appeal to younger visitors, the park's creators could
well look to 2010 hit How to Train Your Dragon for inspiration, and a Top Gun
style flight simulator can't be out of the question.

The production company has any number of horror movies it
can incorporate into a ride with a fear factor, such as the Friday the 13th
series.

There were previously six Paramount theme parks in the United States 
but these were all sold-off and re-branded during a company re-shuffle 
in 2006.

Today, they are operated without the Paramount backing but in their 
heyday, rides on offer included Tomb Raider: The Ride and The Italian 
Job: Stunt Tracks.

Another Paramount theme is set to open in Murcia, Spain, in 2015 and company chiefs predict it will draw in three million visitors to the area every year.

One of the main attractions in the pipeline is Titanic 4D, which will use state-of-the-art special effects to give guests a taste of the iconic vessel.

Meanwhile a 4D Mission: Impossible ride will take visitors
 through action scenes in a military-style vehicle.

Social media was abuzz with when the news was announced.

Teenager Abbie Brett tweeted: 'A theme park up the road... please can this happen', while student Matthew Partridge said: 'If it happens it will be brilliant for Kent '.

Tweeter Jonny, a 23-year-old living in Newcastle, said: ''Used to live right beside here. Do it!'
