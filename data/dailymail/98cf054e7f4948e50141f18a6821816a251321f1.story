Luis Suarez has backtracked on the comments he made after Uruguay beat England, saying it was nothing personal against Roy Hodgson’s World Cup flops.

After scoring the goals that effectively knocked them out of the World Cup, the 27-year-old spoke of his delight at putting the Three Lions to the sword.

‘I dreamt this. I’m enjoying this moment, because of all I suffered, the criticism I received. So, there you go,' he said.

Perhaps those comments were in the heat of the moment, though, as since then, Suarez has somewhat gone back on his original words.

He told Times of India: ‘Even before the match, I had said I knew each of the players I would be playing against.

‘Some were my team-mates in Liverpool with whom I enjoy a healthy relationship and against the others, I had played regularly.

‘But when we are competing we are ready to give our best for the country. They felt the same, tried to do the same. The only difference is, we won.

‘It was nothing personal against any of them and I know it was the same for them, too.

‘We wanted to win the match badly, especially after our defeat to Costa Rica. Thank God we could beat them.’
