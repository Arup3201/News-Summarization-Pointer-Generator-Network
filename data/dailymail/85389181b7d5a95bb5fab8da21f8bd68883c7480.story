If Accrington Stanley beat Yeovil on Tuesday, it could be worth as much as £250,000 to the club. But playing Manchester United would be about far more than money.

They’re a lovely bunch of lads – just imagine how they’ll feel if Accy decide to switch the game to Old Trafford and they’re walking out at the Theatre of Dreams on January 4!

Stop me if I’ve mentioned this before, but I’m a non-executive director at Accrington, and I can tell you they’ve got a smashing set-up there.

The chief executive, Alan Pickup, works for nowt. Our chairman, Peter Marsden, keeps a tight rein on things, and we’re solvent – just about. 

Our manager and his No 2 – John Coleman and Jimmy Bell – are a couple of Scousers who know Accy through and through.

My own association with the club goes back a long way. Unfortunately I was born a year after their only previous game against United – we drew 2-2 with them in the 1946 FA Cup, then lost the replay 5-1. We’ve had a few years to mull that one over…

But I went to school – like everyone else in my family – at Peel Park, which was right next door to where Accy used to play until they were dissolved in 1963.

I grew up with them in my bones. In the 1950s, their manager was a Scot called Walter Galbraith. Virtually the whole team were Scottish, and they used to stay in a local guesthouse, where my Aunty Edith was the housekeeper. I used to wander in and out as I pleased.

You may not know this, but I also played for the youth side after they went down to the Lancashire Combination. I was an inside-left – fancied myself as a bit of a Johnny Haynes.

Not everyone saw it that way, though, and I was transferred to Rosendale United, for – as the local paper put it – “an undisclosed sum”. Suffice to say I didn’t make my fortune, so I carried on playing cricket.

I wish I could be cheering the lads on, but I’ll be on an Emirates flight out of Colombo after England’s seventh and final one-day international here in Sri Lanka. Perhaps the pilot will let us have the score.

All I’ll say is that the players won’t need more motivation than to be reminded of the first three words of our team song, ‘On Stanley, On…’
