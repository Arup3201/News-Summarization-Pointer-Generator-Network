Two condiment fans have told how their obsession means that they are driven to shaving with mustard and want to be cremated and stored in an antique ketchup bottle.

Barry Levinson is so obsessed with mustard that he wears only yellow clothing, eats it with everything, and even brushes his teeth with it.

While aspiring comedian Ralph Finch, who knows 300 jokes about ketchup, even cashed his life insurance policy early to expand his collection.

Barry Levinson is so crazy about the condiment that he owns a collection featuring 5,500 samples of the condiment worth $125,000

Ralph Finch has been collecting ketchup and ketchup memorabilia for 44 years and has spent thousands of dollars

The pair’s stories were featured on Wednesday night’s My Crazy Obsession, a show that features ordinary people’s collections and obsessions.

Mr Levinson, who only wears yellow, fell in love with the condiment more than 25 years ago when during a bout of insomnia he went to the supermarket and heard voices coming from the mustard aisle telling him to collect them.

Since then it has become a 24/7 obsession, with him giving up his job as a lawyer for the state of Wisconsin and devoting his life to his mustard collection and running the National Mustard Museum in Middleton. 

Mr Levinson even shaves with mustard he is so obsessed with it. It has taken over his life

He has built a collection of more than 5,500 samples of mustard from 80 different countries worth $125,000.

But, Mr Levinson’s wife Patti thinks that his obsession is ‘totally crazy’, and has forced him to start therapy to help him focus on other areas of his life.

She said: ‘The fact that Barry used to be a lawyer and gave up that career to collect mustard, I think is a little crazy but he's an obsessive person.'

Mr Levinson's love for mustard grew when in 1987, he grabbed a small jar from a hotel he stayed in and put it in his pocket before an important case in front of the US Supreme Court.

Mr Levinson will eat mustard on anything, including sweets, cakes and desserts

He succeeded and now credits his lucky mustard for the win.

The show also featured Ralph Finch, a ketchup fanatic who eats the sauce with breakfast lunch and dinner, and even spreads it on cookies and sweets.

Mr Finch began his love affair with 
ketchup when his mother, who couldn't cook, used it in all of her 
cooking to give it flavour.

Ralph Finch said that his mother was a terrible cook and that she would put ketchup in every meal to add flavour

The fanatic loves ketchup so much that he cashed his life insurance policy early to expand his collection

Mr Finch loves ketchup so much that when 
he died he wants to be cremated and have his ashes kept in an antique 
ketchup crock pot.

He is so mad about the red dressing that in 2007, much to the despair of his wife Janet, he cashed in his life insurance policy to he could buy more ketchup memorabilia.

Mr Finch now has hundreds of items worth thousands of dollars.

Mr Finch also wants to be a standup comedian, using the 300 jokes he has collected about his favourite sauce.

He said of his obsession: 'It's given me pleasure; it takes a fair chunk of my life.'

My Crazy Obsession will air next Wednesday at 10/9 on TLC.
