South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said on Thursday that he has set up a committee to explore running for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, portraying himself as a proven winner and a conservative willing to work with Democrats.

The 'conservative' part of that description won't sit well with tea party Republicans and others on the right who see him as too accommodating to Democrats. 

Graham told reporters that his new website, called, 'Security Through Strength,' will give him a way to raise money. He plans to visit New Hampshire and Iowa, the first to states to vote in the nomination fight, and see if his pragmatic, non-ideological message resonates.

'GRAHAMNESTY': Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina announced on Thursday that he has formed a presidential exploratory committee. He will annoy tea party Republicans who see him as too moderate and accommodating

'What I'm looking at is: Is there a pathway forward on the ground in Iowa and New Hampshire for a guy like me?' the 59-year-old Graham said on Capitol Hill.

'I don't know until I look.' 

On such issues as national security and President Barack Obama's health care law, the three-term senator said, 'If we don't like what Obama's offering the country, what would we offer the nation?'

He's seen as a moderate on illegal immigration – earning him the nickname 'Lindsey Grahamnesty' – and has upbraided his own party for failing to reach out more effectively to Hispanic voters. 

He also helped write a comprehensive immigration overhaul bill as part of the so-called 'Gang of Eight.'

Right-wing radio hosts mock Graham as 'Goober,' for his 'aw shucks' Southern twang.

But he said on Thursday that 'a center-right candidacy can prevail in America.' 

'I mean, are we going to be a party that embraces the fact that Democrats exist and you can get no big deal done without their buy-in?' he explained.

Some Republicans, most notably evangelical Christians, have been wary of Graham, the never-married and childless South Carolinian. 

And his pattern of compromising with Democrats looks like a white flag to many of the conservatives whose enthusiasm drives fundraising and attndance at speeches during the crucial early going.

Graham, they point out, voted for Obama's nominees to the Supreme Court and is likely to vote in favor of Loretta Lynch for attorney general.

But his national security credential could carry him past the first few hurdles.

Graham told a Fox News Chanel audience on Thursday that 'Ronald Reagan famously said his goal was to have peace through strength. In my view, you can never have peace with radical Islam.'

'They want to destroy us and our way of life, so peaceful coexistence is a nonstarter from their point of you and, quite frankly, from my point of view. But you can have security.'

Now two dozen Republicans, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, have expressed at least some interest in running next year.

Graham bristled when asked how the party's conservative base could trust him given that voting record. He pointed out three times that he won the GOP nomination for Senate by 41 percentage points.

'I represent a form of conservatism that's acceptable in the reddest of red states,' he said. 'I am conservative by any rational definition.'

Graham has been a close ally of Sen. John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee who lost to Obama.

'I formally endorse him. He has my all-out complete support,' McCain said Thursday, according to Bloomberg. 

The South Carolinian cruised to re-election in November, easily defeating six GOP primary rivals who cited his history of negotiating with Democrats as proof that he wasn't conservative enough.
