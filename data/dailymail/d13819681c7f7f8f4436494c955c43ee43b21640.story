Utah is one step closer to once again using firing squads to carry out executions after a highly-contested proposal passed a key vote in the state's Legislature.

Before the vote ultimately passed in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives by a 39-34 margin yesterday morning, three missing lawmakers were summoned to break a tie.

The state voted to stop allowing prisoners to choose death by firing squad in 2004.

The proposal still has an uncertain fate in the state's GOP-controlled Senate. 

Leaders in that chamber have thus far declined to say if they'll support it, and Utah's Republican Gov. Gary Herbert won't say if he's in favor of the measure.  

Republican Senate President Wayne Niederhauser declined to tell reporters  if he'd support it.

Rep. Paul Ray is sponsoring the measure.

He said: 'It is never easy to talk about taking another life, but in our judicial system we have a means that requires that sometimes.

'We have to have an option.'

He added, according to USA TODAY:

'If we go hanging, if we go to the guillotine, or we go to the firing squad, electric chair, you're still going to have the same circus atmosphere behind it. 

'So is it really going to matter?'

The Utah execution chamber was shot up after prisoner Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed by five police officers with .30-caliber Winchester rifles in 2010

This is the firing squad execution chamber at the Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah. The state voted to stop allowing prisoners to pick death by firing squad in 2004

Lawmakers initially voted 35-35 on the proposal Friday morning.

After the tie, the three missing lawmakers were summoned to the floor, where they all voted in favor.

During that time, Riverton Republican Rep. Dan McCay switched to vote in favor.

A firing squad was last used in the state in 2010 when Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed by five police officers with .30-caliber Winchester rifles.

For years, states have used a three-drug combination to execute inmates.

European drug makers are now refusing to sell the drugs to prisons and corrections departments out of opposition to the death penalty. 

Several opponents of the firing squad bill were disappointed by Friday's vote but encouraged it passed on such a slim margin.

Anna Brower with the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah said: 'The fact that it was so close in our state is really exciting.

'I think there are legislators who, while they may have complicated feelings about the death penalty, understand that this particular method is not good advertising for Utah.'
