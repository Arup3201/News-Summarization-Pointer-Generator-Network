Locals in Richmond, London, have become the first in the UK to pay for products on the high street using a profile picture. 

The borough's high street has begun using a payment system that works by simply recognising customers by their first name and picture via a mobile phone app.

The app for iOS, Windows OS and Android phones highlights nearby shops and restaurants that accept PayPal.

The customer checks in by clicking on the required retailer and sliding an animated pin down on their screen.

The customer's name and photo then appears on the shop's payment system and the retailer charges them by clicking on their image.

The customer then receives an alert on their phone to let them know how much they have paid as well as PayPal's usual email receipt.

‘Customers don’t have to worry about having cards, cash or change, just their phones,’ said Richard Garcia, owner and proprietor of Cook and Garcia café who offers the service.

‘It is the quickest transaction through the till, which means less queues and we never have to turn down a sale, both of which are great for business.’

The initiative by PayPal comes as payment companies, banks and technology firms battle it out to become consumers’ default mobile digital wallet.

Bank cards are already being replaced by phones and wristbands that have payment technology built-in- but the latest threat to the lowly plastic in your pocket could be your face.A Finnish startup called Uniqul has launched what it calls the first ever payment platform based on facial recognition.The system doesn’t require a wallet, bank card or phone - instead a camera is positioned at the checkout and takes a photo of a shopper's face when they are ready to pay.

Ismail Ahmed, the co-founder of The Farmery frozen yogurt store in Richmond said: ‘Lots of our customers have a mobile phone, and are familiar with using apps on their phones.

‘What’s better is that we didn’t even have to change anything about the way we run our business – we’re still using the same tills and system, including iPads and iPhones to operate the technology. 

‘All the customer has to do is check in on their phone, we see them on our system and we can just charge them – they can even check in before they get to the shop for their frozen yoghurt, saving even more time.’

PayPal first brought ‘pay by mobile’ to the UK high street two years ago.

The company said its latest Richmond initiative is designed to offer local businesses a more personal experience.

As well as confirming the identity of the customer, retailers can view other customer information like recent and favourite transactions, it said.

Paypal is hoping to roll the technology out to the rest of the UK, but plans have not yet been confirmed. 

'In the UK, we are currently live with 12 merchants in Richmond using the new check in function in the app,' a PayPal spokesperson told MailOnline.

'While we can’t disclose any confirmed retailers who will use "check in to pay", we will have brands such as Oasis, Coast, Karen Millen, Warehouse, Snow and Rock, Runners Need, Cycle Surgery, M&Co, Soletrader, SOLE and Thomas Pink live within the app this year.' PayPal added that it expects to have over 2000 locations using the app by the end of the year.
