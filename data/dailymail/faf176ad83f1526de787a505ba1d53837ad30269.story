An adviser to the Leveson Inquiry has broken ranks to reject one of its most contentious conclusions: that police should keep secret arrests of criminal suspects.

Shami Chakrabarti said that although it was wrong for the police to brief against suspects to ‘pressure or punish’, it was ‘equally chilling’ for officers to refuse to name someone they have detained or charged.

She also condemned a ‘blanket policy of arresting people in secret’.

Outspoken: Shami Chakrabarti rejected one of Leveson's key conclusions that police should keep secret arrests of criminal suspects

Findings: Lord Justice Leveson's report into Press standards concluded that unless some exceptional circumstance applied, 'the names or identifying details or those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the Press or public'

Lord Justice Leveson’s report into Press standards concluded that unless some exceptional circumstance applied, ‘the names or identifying details or those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the Press or public’.

But yesterday Miss Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, the civil liberties and human rights campaign group, said: ‘Police briefing against arrested individuals to pressure or punish is clearly abusive but it’s equally chilling for officers to refuse to confirm names of those detained or charged.

‘Aggressively volunteering suspects’ identities is one thing, a blanket policy of arresting people in secret, without the knowledge of Press and public, is quite another.

‘Clearer guidance to forces is plainly required but all the rules and policies in the world are no substitute for a deeper understanding of the sensitive use of discretion to protect the public including vulnerable suspects.’

Her comments will fuel the growing backlash against police plans for draconian restrictions on what information they release. Within weeks, senior officers will publish new rules barring forces from identifying anyone who has been arrested, which has horrified free speech campaigners.

Yesterday a Daily Mail survey revealed that 14 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales are keeping secret the names of suspects even after they have been charged.

Publicity: On Thursday it emerged that BBC sexual predator Stuart Hall might never have been brought to justice under the proposed new secrecy regime

Fears over the influence of Leveson on police secrecy were raised on Wednesday when one  force announced it would no longer name suspects it had charged with a criminal offence.

The Warwickshire force made the announcement in a footnote to a Press release revealing that one of its own former officers had been charged with stealing more than £100,000. On Thursday the force reversed its position.

Secret sentence: The Daily Mail revealed the case of Wanda Maddocks, who was imprisoned for five months for contempt after trying to get her 80-year-old father John out of a care home where his family believed he was in danger

Critics say secret arrests are the hallmark of authoritarian countries. On Thursday it emerged that BBC sexual predator Stuart Hall might never have been brought to justice under the proposed new secrecy regime.

Publicity surrounding his arrest in December led to more than a dozen other victims coming forward. If they had not added their complaints, the case might have collapsed for lack of evidence. After his arrest, Hall, 83, declared his innocence and invoked Leveson to complain about ‘systematic leaks to the media’.

The country’s most senior judge yesterday instructed his colleagues that they must never again send anybody to prison in secret.

Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, said it was a ‘fundamental principle’ that people jailed for contempt of court should be sentenced in public. He warned judges: ‘This is mandatory. There are no exceptions’.

The ‘important guidance’ from Lord Judge – backed by the chief family courts judge Sir James Munby – came ten days after the Daily Mail revealed the case of Wanda Maddocks, who was imprisoned for five months for contempt after trying to get her 80-year-old father John out of a care home where his family believed he was in danger.

The hearing of the Court of Protection at which Miss Maddocks, 50, was sentenced was effectively secret.
