Michael Carrick has warned Manchester United's rivals that their 'scary' strikeforce is starting to fire on all cylinders.

Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie were both on target in Saturday's 3-0 win over Hull City, and Radamel Falcao came off the bench to make his first appearance in almost six weeks following a calf injury.

Rooney is a doubt for Tuesday's clash with Stoke at Old Trafford after suffering a knock on his knee at the weekend, and Angel di Maria definitely misses out due to a hamstring strain.

But the signs are there that United's stars are starting to align, according to Carrick.

'When you have got Robin and Wayne scoring, and Falcao coming off the bench and nearly scoring, we'll be a threat to anyone,' said the England midfielder. 'You want those boys when they're flying and it's scary to play against.

'What Robin and Wayne did against Hull, we've seen that happen so often in the past and hopefully we'll see that in the coming weeks again. When you've got those lads scoring goals and creating chances it gives the whole team huge confidence and belief.'

United face Stoke having won five of their seven home games this season, and Carrick believes that Louis van Gaal is gradually restoring the air of invincibility around Old Trafford that disappeared under David Moyes.

'That's the sort of standard we want to be at, dominating teams and winning,' he added. 'Hopefully we can carry on like this and that fear factor will creep back.'

Meanwhile, Victor Valdes was back at Carrington on Monday despite reports that the Spanish goalkeeper had stopped training with United.

Mark Hughes believes Manchester United have fallen too far behind Chelsea to stand a chance in the title race – but senses danger that Van Gaal's team are building up a run of form.

He will take his Stoke players to Old Trafford more confident of getting a result than in recent years however, and plans on using the same attacking style that beat Manchester City.

'Retention of the ball is key for us, you need to show bravery on it,' Hughes said. 'We have shown that at City and at the weekend against Liverpool. A lot more teams are going to Old Trafford and really testing themselves and see how far it takes them.

'United seem to be hitting a bit of form which is a bit unfortunate from our point of view. They suffered at the start of the season with injuries but you do feel once they have everyone back they are going to have a say in whoever wins the league this year. It's beyond them I think but you never know.'

Stoke's preparations have been hampered by two injuries to Steve Sidwell and Glenn Whelan, picked up during the 1-0 defeat at Anfield on Saturday.

Whelan suffered a thigh problem, Sidwell tore his medial knee ligament and will be out for up to six weeks – but that is a shorter period than initially feared. 'It's still a blow but not as bad as first thought,' said Hughes.
