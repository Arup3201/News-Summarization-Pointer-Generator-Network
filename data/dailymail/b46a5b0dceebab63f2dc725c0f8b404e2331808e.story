Steve Bruce has confirmed Hull's interest in signing Carl Jenkinson on loan from Arsenal, if the defender is available.

The Gunners are close to signing right-back Calum Chambers from Arsenal and have already brought France international Mathieu Debuchy from Newcastle to play in that position leaving Jenkinson's chances of regular football under threat.

But Bruce, who is trying to build on Hull's 16th-placed Premier League finish and FA Cup final appearance, is keen to add to his squad ahead of the coming season.

Temporary exit: Hull have confirmed an interest in signing Carl Jenkinson on loan from Arsenal

New arrivals: Mathieu Debuchy and Calum Chambers could keep Jenkinson out of the Arsenal team

Interested: Steve Bruce has been busy trying to arrange deals to strengthen Hull this summer

Bruce said: 'I had a conversation with Arsenal four or five weeks ago to say "would it be possible?", and apparently it might be.

'We'll look at that situation.

'We haven't had confirmation from Arsenal and I would hate to upset them by speaking out of turn but we are led to believe the kid might be available for loan.

'If he is, then of course we would be interested.'

Propsect: Hull are also close to signing Scotland international Andrew Robertson from Dundee United

Strength: Hull have added Robert Snodgrass and Jake Livermore to their ranks this summer

Bruce has had a busy summer in the transfer market, tying up deals for midfielders Jake Livermore and Robert Snodgrass and winger Tom Ince and he is also close to completing the signing of left-back Andrew Robertson from Dundee United.

Robertson joined United from Queens Park in 2013 and has since gone on to represent Scotland and win the PFA Young Player of the Year award and now he looks set to become a Premier League player.

'We've got an agreement in place, the boy's travelling down tomorrow with his representatives,' Bruce said.

'We think he's an exciting player, he's had a meteoric rise and we think he's going to be a really, really good player, so let's hope we can get it over the line.'
