The mother of the gunman who murdered two NYPD officers on Saturday has extended her condolences to their families and said she is 'deeply sorry' for her son's actions.

Speaking on Monday, Shakuwra Dabre, 54, of Brooklyn said she identified with the families pain because she too had lost a son.

'I am still deeply sorry about what happened at the hands of my son,' she told  the Daily News . 'And please accept my deepest condolences, sincerely.

'As a mother now I hurt for the loss of my son. Just like they're hurting for the loss of their sons.'

Dabre said that her son had struggled with mental illness his entire life and had repeatedly refused attempts by the family to try and help him.

'Unfortunately, this situation happened and it culminated in the end of his life and the tragic loss of two innocent police officers,' she said.

Dabre was out running errands on Saturday when she was alerted that her son was in trouble by the estranged mother of his child.

She raced home and when she scanned the news on her laptop she saw a photo of a man lying on a stretcher accompanying a story about the shooting.

'I knew he was dead when I looked. I knew. He was gone. I knew he was my son,' Dabre told DNA Info through tears.

When Dabre first saw the picture of her son on the stretcher, she didn't know he had shot and killed Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, she said.

Dabre remembered her son as a 'charismatic and likeable' man who had suffered depression and anger management issues throughout his life

'I was so torn when I saw him on that stretcher,' she said. 'Then I found out too that he did that. And I was horrified. Because I didn't want no loss of nobody's life.'

Dabre remembered her son as a social and funny 'free spirit' who loved fashion.

'He was a very charismatic, likeable young man. He was very intelligent. He was witty. If he could channel his energies properly, he could've grown up to be a very good outstanding young man. And I had high hopes for him,' she said.

But Brinsley also suffered from depression and had anger management issues throughout his life, Dabre said.

He tried to kill himself when he was about 14 years old, was briefly institutionalized and at one point took medications that made him gain weight, she said.

'I wanted him to continue whatever they had him under, but he didn't want to and I couldn't make him,' Dabre said. The pair hadn't spoken since July.

Brinsley had a long criminal record, a hatred for police and the government and an apparent history of mental instability that included an attempt to hang himself a year ago, authorities said on Sunday.

Moments before opening fire, he approached people on the street and asked them to follow him on Instagram, then told them, 'Watch what I'm going to do,' Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said.

A portrait of the Brooklyn-born gunman emerged as big-city police departments and union leaders around the country warned officers to change up their routines and insist on extra backup a day after Brinsley carried out what he portrayed online as retaliation for the slayings of black men at the hands of white police.

Brinsley was black; the slain officers were Asian and Hispanic.

Investigators were trying to determine if Brinsley had taken part in any protests over the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, whose names he invoked in his online threat, or simply latched on to the cause for the final act in a violent rampage.

They said he traveled frequently between the South and New York, where he fathered a child in Brooklyn, and had been in the city earlier in the week.

Brinsley, 28, had at least 19 arrests in Georgia and Ohio, spent two years in prison for gun possession and had a troubled childhood so violent that his mother was afraid of him, police said. He ranted online about police and the government and expressed 'self-despair and anger at himself and where his life was,' Boyce said.

On Saturday afternoon, Brinsley approached a squad car from behind in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant section and fired four shots, killing Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. He then ran into a subway station and committed suicide.

Hours earlier, Brinsley had shot and wounded his ex-girlfriend at her home outside Baltimore, then made threatening posts online, including a vow to put 'wings on pigs' and references to the Brown and Garner cases.

Baltimore-area police warned the New York department that Brinsley was in the city and bent on violence. But New York police were still getting the word out when Brinsley struck.

The slayings dramatically escalated tensions that have simmered for months over police killings of blacks.
