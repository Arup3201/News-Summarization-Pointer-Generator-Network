The shinpads and kits of several of Germany and Brazil's stars have been revealed ahead of their World Cup semi-final showdown on Tuesday.

Interestingly, Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger appears to favour some very old-fashioned looking shinpads, whilst his Germany team-mate Miroslav Klose prefers a picture of his kids.

Brazil defender Dante, called upon for the first time in this World Cup following the suspension of Thiago Silva, has gone for a more patriotic-looking pad, whilst Hulk has gone for a picture of himself with his partner alongside a snap of his parents.

Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels, who has already scored twice so far in Brazil, has gone for a yellow and black pattern, whilst team-mate Manuel Neuer also has his kit on show.

Brazil and Germany are set to face off in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday for a place in the final of the World Cup.

The two sides have not met in the tournament since 2002, when two goals from Ronaldo gave Brazil a 2-0 victory in the final.
