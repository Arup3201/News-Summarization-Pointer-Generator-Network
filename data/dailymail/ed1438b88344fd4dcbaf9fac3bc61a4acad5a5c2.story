Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists his side's week-long trip to Abu Dhabi did not influence their shock FA Cup loss to Championship side Middlesbrough.

The Barclays Premier League champions spent the five days prior to Saturday's fourth-round tie at the Etihad Stadium at a warm-weather training camp in the United Arab Emirates.

The team only returned to Manchester on Friday evening and questions were quickly asked about the wisdom of the venture after goals from Patrick Bamford and Kike dumped them out of the cup.

But Pellegrini, who did have the option to return on Thursday after playing a friendly against Hamburg the previous day, denied the travel was a factor.

'I don't think so,' said Pellegrini at his post-match press conference, when asked about the matter. 'I don't agree but you can have your opinion. I have a different opinion.

'We had six or seven clear chances to score at the beginning. I think we played very well.

'After they scored the goal we were disorderly and they had another counter-attack and they could score more goals.

'But it is very easy to say that (about Abu Dhabi). I don't think that is the reason.

'You can analyse the game and if you think that is the reason, that is your reason but I have a different opinion from that.'

Patrick Bamford raced through to put Middlesbrough ahead early in the second half

City dominated the first half but were repeatedly denied by Middlesbrough's former Real Madrid goalkeeper Tomas Mejias.

Bamford's strike after 53 minutes changed the complexion of the game and substitute Kike put the result beyond doubt in injury time.

Pellegrini said: 'We had two games in the same match. Before they scored we did played very well. After that I think Middlesbrough deserved to continue in the cup.

'But I feel it is not normal not to score in the last two games at home.

'I think there are a lot of football reasons rather than Abu Dhabi. They are different things.'
