Jim Diers, who was announced dead by the Mayor of Seattle, and had to make a public announcement to denounce the claims

A Seattle official who was eulogised by the city's Mayor had to deny he had passed away after he started receiving condolence messages.

Seattle Mayor Ed Murray had issued a news release mourning his death earlier before, giving a short statement and then a eulogy about Jim Diers, a public official who worked with the city's neighbourhoods and communities.

The Mayor's office told CNN that it mistook his death with that of another local official with a similar name to Diers'.

The Mayor said in a statement: 'I'm very saddened by the death of Jim Diers.

'He was an innovator in bringing 
communities together, and made a significant contribution to the 
foundation that makes Seattle special.

'His work with neighourhoods was passionate and progressive.

'His service to this city was unmeasurable.'

However, shortly after the announcement, 
Mr Diers started noticing an influx of messages from people on his 
Facebook who were saddened about his death.

Seattle Mayor Ed Murray gave a heartfelt eulogy for a public official who wasn't dead, promptly redacting the statement after the man who was thought to be deceased spoke up

He also received messages asking whether he was alive or not.

He set the record straight by posting a message on Facebook that detailed that he was very much alive.

It read: 'I genuinely appreciate the Mayor's concern, but I want to assure you that I am very much alive.

'I returned from Ontario at 1:00 this morning, participated in a conference call at 6:00am, gave a talk in Tacoma, and am now preparing to teach a class at the UW tonight.

'I'm dead tired today, but otherwise I'm feeling great!

'Thanks everyone for your concern, but I really don't have any time for death.'

Half an hour after Murray's office released a statement about Diers' death, they retracted it.

The statement read: 'Jim Diers...is alive and well.

Â  A 79-year-old woman from Maine received a letter telling her she had recently passed away, according to Fox and Friends.

The letter, which came from her insurance company, told Shirley Beaver it was no longer going to be providing her prescription medication because she was dead.

She immediately called her son and said: 'You've got to come here...I'm dead.'

Shirley Beaver received a letter from her insurance company that said she was dead, and that it was going to cancel her coverage for her heart medication

The story was reported on local TV stations and in local newspaper, The Morning Sentinel

The woman relies on Social Security to support herself and her two sons, one of which is disabled and the other who has suffered four heart attacks and a stroke.

She said she couldn't get her heart medication, with is worth around $1,000 a month, because of the mix up.

To resolve the situation, she took a 22-mile trip to the social security office with one of her sons, but so far, nothing has been fixed.

'I've never had good luck in my life anyway', she said.
