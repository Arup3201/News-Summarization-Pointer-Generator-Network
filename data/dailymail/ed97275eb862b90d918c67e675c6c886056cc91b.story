A new powdered alcohol product announced just days ago has had its approval promptly reversed following a barrage of negative publicity surrounding fears that it could encourage irresponsible - and even underage - drinking.

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau approved Palcohol's powdered vodka, rum, and other cocktails ‘in error,’ Tom Hogue, the agency's director of congressional and public affairs, told The Associated Press via email. The agency did not responded to further questions.

The company behind Palcohol, Tempe, Arizona-based Lipsmark, said that ‘there seemed to be a discrepancy [about] how much powder’ is in the packets, which are meant to be mixed with water.

Prior to having its approval withdrawn on Monday, Palcohol had previously announced six varieties of powdered alcohol including vodka and rum

According to the website for the Alcohol 
and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, multiple varieties of Palcohol 
received ‘label approval’ on April 8.

Palcohol had previously announced six 
varieties of powdered alcohol, including vodka, rum and four cocktails -
 Cosmopolitan, Mojito, Powderita and Lemon Drop.

The company agreed to surrender its approvals on Monday and has said that it will resubmit the product for approval by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.

No
 sooner had Palcohol announced its initial products 
than critics where questioning the potential dangers of a powered form 
of alcohol which could fit into a pocket, making it more portable 
than a bottle or flask of liquor.

Vodka and eggs? As well as adding the alcoholic power to water, the site also suggested that Palcohol could be poured over food

The
 company initially did little to discourage these fears as the Palcohol website featured a lot of information on how the product could be used to consume alcohol in unusual ways and little about promoting 
‘responsible drinking’.

'Maybe
 you’re a college football fan. So many stadiums don’t even serve 
alcohol. What’s that about; watching football without drinking?! That’s 
almost criminal. Bring Palcohol in and enjoy the game,' stated the 
website.

As well as adding the alcoholic power to water, the site also suggested that Palcohol could be poured over food.

'Sprinkle
 Palcohol on almost any dish and give it an extra kick. Some of our 
favorites are the Kamikaze in guacamole, Rum on a BBQ sandwich, Cosmo on
 a salad and Vodka on eggs in the morning to start your day off right.'

There
 were even some rudimentary cooking instructions: 'Remember, you have to
 add Palcohol AFTER a dish is cooked as the alcohol will burn off if you
 cook with it... and that defeats the whole purpose.'

The
 company also appeared to be encouraging users to try snorting their product: 'You’ll get drunk almost instantly 
because the alcohol will be absorbed so quickly in your nose.'

Those
 posts were quickly taken down and the company claims it was simply 
experimenting with 'edgy marketing' that wasn't meant to be seen by the public.

Party on! The company had stated that Palcohol would make it easier to consume alcohol where it is normally banned, such as at ball games

Palcohol had previously announced several cocktail varieties including Lemon Drop and a Powderita

‘As
 Palcohol is a new product, we have yet to understand its potential of 
being added to food,’ the website now states, along with warning people 
that the powder shouldn't be snorted.

According
 to the site, the product’s founder Mark Phillips came up with the idea 
because he is an ‘active guy’ and wanted a way to enjoy an adult 
beverage after long hours hiking, biking or camping without having to 
carry around heavy bottles.

'What
 we can say now is that we hope the product will be used in a 
responsible and legal manner. Being in compliance with all Federal and 
State laws is very important to us. Palcohol will only be sold through 
establishments that are licensed to sell liquor.'

Powdered
 alcohol is not a new concept. Such products are already being sold in 
other countries including Japan, Germany, and the Netherlands.

According to some, alcohol laws would in general only apply to liquids.

This
 would mean that powder-based alcoholic beverages could be sold to 
minors and that the powder would be exempt from alcohol tax and laws, as
 is the case with certain products in the Netherlands.
