Jose Mourinho admitted his Chelsea side were lucky to get a draw against Paris Saint-Germain after goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was forced to make a string of impressive saves.

The visitors took the lead through Branislav Ivanovic but Edinson Cavani equalised soon after and both he and Zlatan Ibrahimovic came close to providing the Ligue 1 champions with a winning goal.

Their efforts, though, were thwarted by Courtois, who more than made up for the frailty of the defence in front of him.

'We could (have lost) so the result is a positive one,' Mourinho told ITV. 'I don't say very good because it depends on the result of the second leg but I say positive result against a very good team, a team with fantastic attacking payers. It was a difficult match.

'When you see the performance of our goalkeeper you have to say yes (we were lucky to get a draw) because our goalkeeper made two or three important saves in the game.'

Mourinho's side began the Champions League tie strongly but faded in the second half, a factor the Portuguese manager attributed to fitness issues in the squad. 

He said: 'I had in this team five players that didn't train. Five players since the game against Everton they didn't train once. Yesterday they had a warming down and also for the press to see that they were on the pitch.

'We felt that a little.  I'm happy with the result. Two legs is now one leg with everything to be decided at Stamford Bridge.'

The result means the west Londoners are well placed to progress - certainly better, in John Terry's view, than when they advanced to the semi-finals at PSG's expense last term on away goals after losing 3-1 at the Parc des Princes.

'I think both teams were kind of feeling each other out in the first half,' said the Chelsea captain. 'It was quite an even game and we managed to go one-up.

'But it was a difficult second half. Thibaut pulled off some great saves to keep us in it, but we got away with a happy draw.

'I think the key was last year I think we made it very difficult for ourselves going back to the Bridge - we're in a lot better position now.

'Listen, they're a very good side, especially going forwards. It is going to be very tough but we're in a better position than we were last year.'

Courtois was particularly impressive for Chelsea, making a string of fine saves after coming in for Petr Cech.

'He was different class,' Terry added. 'When you look at Petr in the week, he made two great saves from (Everton's Romelu) Lukaku to win us three points.

'Thibaut came back in today. The competition is great and it is fierce amongst the squad. That's what is needed. We are all playing a team game.'
