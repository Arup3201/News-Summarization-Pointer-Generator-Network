A German man accused of choking his 91-year-old socialite wife to death in the United States described their relationship as 'a marriage of convenience', a court has heard.

In an audio tape of a police interview played to jurors on Monday, Albrecht Muth, 49, explained that he hadn't bothered trying to resuscitate elderly Viola Drath in the bathroom of their home in Georgetown, Washington D.C because 'the obvious was obvious'.

Muth, who is considered too ill to attend court after repeat periods of fasting for what he claims are 'religious reasons', has been charged with first-degree murder over the August 2011 beating and strangulation death of German-born Drath and faces life in prison if convicted.

The interview, recorded in a cramped police interrogation room in the days between the discovery of Drath's body and her husband's arrest, gave jurors their closest look yet at the defendant.

Muth has been absent from the trial, participating passively through video conference, after doctors said his self-imposed starvation made him too weak to appear in court.

The case is expected to go to the jury later this week.

Muth's lawyers say he's innocent and that there's no evidence he killed 
his wife.

Prosecutors, meanwhile, say Muth lived off a monthly allowance
 from his wife that had recently been reduced and that he killed Drath 
in hopes of collecting a portion of her estate.

In video shown to 
jurors, detectives asked Muth to walk them through the discovery of 
Drath's body but didn't ask whether he had anything to do with her 
death.

When one of the detectives noted the large age difference and 
asked whether the couple was intimate, Muth replies, 'We had a marriage 
of convenience.'

Muth called police early on August 12, 2011, to 
report finding his wife dead in a third-floor bathroom of their home in 
Georgetown, an expensive Washington D.C. neighborhood.

Investigators initially 
treated the death as one of natural causes but settled on Muth as the 
suspect after finding no signs of forced entry and determining he and 
Drath were the only ones home at the time she died.

A crime scene 
technician testified on Monday that none of the home's windows had been 
opened.

Another investigator said he found internet searches on Muth's 
laptop computer for flights to Iceland, crossing the Canadian border, 
extradition arrangements with Mexico and challenging a prenuptial 
agreement.

Latoya Jamison, a forensic investigator with
 the D.C. medical examiner's office, said Muth appeared anxious and 
fidgety but otherwise emotionless after she came to the home to take 
photographs and inspect the body.

She said he seemed especially curious 
to know the cause of death and whether any trauma was found that could 
explain it.

One of Drath's daughters testified that Muth told her that 
her mother had been having balance problems, but she said that surprised
 her since her mother had been in excellent physical health.

With 
Drath's daughters and other relatives present in the courtroom, 
prosecutors presented photographs of Drath sprawled dead on the bathroom
 floor.

A large, bloody gash covered her neck, another wound was found 
on the back of her neck and a fingernail had nearly been ripped off, 
Jamison said.

She said the position of Drath's body struck her as 
peculiar for someone who would have died from a fall - as Muth had 
maintained - or of natural causes.

She said it appeared likely that 
Drath had died somewhere else in the house and then been placed in the 
bathroom, which prosecutors contend is what happened.

One of Drath's daughters, Connie Drath Dwyer, testified that Muth had begun pressuring her mother for money.

She
 recalled how he wore an eye patch the first time they met, saying he 
had lost his eye to injury and made reference to having been a mercenary
 soldier in South America.

She said she never again saw him with a patch
 and never noticed problems with his eye.

Prosecutors contend the 
patch was part of a web of elaborate fictions that Muth spun about his 
professional career and connections.

He had claimed to be a brigadier 
general with the Iraqi army, but the military uniform he would wear 
around the neighborhood was actually purchased and that he had no 
authentic army connections.
