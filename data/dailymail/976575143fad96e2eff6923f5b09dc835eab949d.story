CBS has cut a Rihanna song from its Thursday night football broadcasts amid more controversy over the NFL and domestic violence.

The network said Tuesday it was permanently editing a song featuring Rihanna's voice out of its Thursday night NFL telecasts — after the singer issued a profane tweet about it.

However the singer has hit back, claiming she actually rescinded the rights to the song before CBS dropped it.

A portion of Jay-Z's Run This Town featuring Rihanna - who was the victim of a high-profile domestic assault in 2009 -  was cut from last Thursday's game because CBS was covering the controversy over Rice's assault of his then-fiancee.

Angry: Rihanna reacts on Twitter after it was suggested her being the victim of a high-profile domestic violence incident was the reason her NFL performance was pulled

CBS 
planned to use the song Thursday and for the rest of the season, but 
Rihanna tweeted, 'CBS you pulled my song last week, now you wanna slide 
it back in this Thursday?'

Before adding: 'NO! F**** you! Y'all are sad for penalizing me for this.

CBS then issued a statement saying that it was 'moving in a different direction' with different theme music.

CBS Sports Chairman Sean McManus had said that the changes were made to give the game coverage a more 'subdued' tone and journalistic approach.

Asked if Rihanna's own history as a victim of domestic violence was a reason the song was cut, McManus said it was among several factors considered but was not the overriding one.

Rihanna - whose then boyfriend Chris Brown was charged with assault for attacking the singer at the 2009 Grammys - added on Twitter: 'The audacity'.

But the singer claims she was angered that CBS marketed their Thursday Night Football show using Rihanna's name, even though they had only licensed her song for the opening credits.

A spokesman told TMZ: 'Due to the misuse and misrepresentation of Rihanna's name and participation in connection to CBS TNF, CBS was not allowed to license and utilize the song 'Run This Town.' Roc Nation made the decision to not grant the song’s usage.' 

Nope, not finished: Rihanna went back on Twitter to add a second thought

Last week, Chris Brown told Rolling Stone that Ray Rice should seek therapy, as he did.

'To Ray, or anybody else... It's all about how you control yourself,' Chris, 25, said, as he discussed how he's learned to manage his anger since his 2009 assault of then-girlfriend Rihanna.

‘I can just say I’ve been down that road,’ Chris said.  ‘I deal with situations and I’ve made my mistakes too, but it’s all about how you push forward and how you control yourself.’

CBS' Thursday Night Football, featuring the debut game of Pittsburgh Steelers at Baltimore, eliminated a track of Jay-Z's, Run This Town, featuring Rihanna and Kanye West - along with other 'high energy' elements and a comedic stint, NFL officials said.

Former Ravens star Ray Rice is shown in May with his wife Janay at a New Jersey courthouse to face charges of domestic violence. He was let go from the Baltimore team this week after the full video emerged from the incident showing Rice punching his then-fiancée unconscious
