Gordon Brown has called for British forces to be deployed to Nigeria to help rescue the 200 missing schoolgirls

Gordon Brown has called for British forces to be deployed to Nigeria to aid the rescue of more than 200 schoolgirls being held captive by Islamic militants.

The former Prime Minister told MPs last night the failure to rescue the girls, who were kidnapped by the terrorist group Boko Haram two months ago, demanded an ‘international and domestic response’.

‘We have to do more to help the Nigerian government secure the rescue of the girls,’ he said.

‘While it is right to recognise there has been a great deal of international support, it is also right to acknowledge that in its hour of need, Nigeria does require more helicopter support, more aircraft cover, more surveillance equipment.’

He added that Britain should support president Goodluck Jonathan’s call for better intelligence sharing and if necessary ‘Special Forces and law enforcement agencies to help them confront terrorism’.

Britain and several African countries have already established an intelligence unit to help the Nigerian authorities.

Britain was one of the first countries to join the hunt for the 12 to 18-year olds, abducted from their boarding school in Chibok in the lawless northern Borno region. It was described by William Hague as a ‘disgusting and immoral’ act.

Military chiefs had considered sending in the Special Air Service and the Special Boat Service to help search.

The Special Forces’ director was reported to have told the Foreign Office in May that UK personnel could support the Nigerian armed forces with drones, intelligence, military planning or even join a rescue.

But it was understood top brass were 
reluctant to take part in a raid after the botched SBS mission in which 
British construction worker Chris McManus, 28, was executed by his 
Nigerian kidnappers in March 2012.

Mr Brown, who is now an UN envoy as well as an MP, said there were 
thousands of other victims of the abduction – the children in the region
 who can no longer attend school for their own safety.

He said the news 
that another 90 children had been kidnapped last month had been greeted 
with just a ‘flicker of interest’.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said it did not comment on Special Forces.
