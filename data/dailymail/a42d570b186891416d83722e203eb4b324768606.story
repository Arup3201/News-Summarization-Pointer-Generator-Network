Arsene Wenger may have come out fighting against his growing number of detractors this week but the cold, hard truth is that Arsenal remain staggeringly short of what's required.

While staunch supporters of the Frenchman will point towards yet another season in the Champions League knockout stages, a glance at the Premier League table shows just how short they've been since August.

The Gunners are astonishingly 12 points worse off today than they were at this stage last season when, heading into Christmas, Wenger found himself top of the tree.

That lead was cut in the end - Arsenal finished fourth - and what's followed has been definite regression.

But they aren't the only ones.

The Merseyside pair Everton and Liverpool have dropped a combined 19 points from this time last season. Roberto Martinez, heralded as the man who has the stylish brand of football to drag the Toffees into the top four, has struggled; Everton have conceded far too many goals.

Then there's Brendan. Red legend Steve Nicol pulled no punches after they were dumped out of Europe, but the domestic form is actually more of a concern.

‘If things don’t change then ultimately Brendan will pay the price,’ he said. And you do wonder whether Daniel Levy is getting twitchy with Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham already, given their negative six-point swing.

For others, however, the comparisons are very welcome indeed.

None more so than Sam Allardyce, who will be crowing at an incredible 14-point difference in their tallies. This time last year the Hammers were fourth-bottom and Allardyce was for the chop.

Now they find themselves in the top four and - perhaps more strikingly - comfortably in the European running, four points ahead of Arsenal down in sixth.

Sunderland might have a case to be pleased after accumulating seven additional points in 2013-14, but looking at where they were last year - rock bottom with just eight points - Gus Poyet won't draw too many conclusions.

Interestingly, the high-flying Southampton and Newcastle are just a win away from the same totals - suggesting they are at home in the upper echelons of the top flight.

It's Wenger who won't want to look. What a difference a year makes.
