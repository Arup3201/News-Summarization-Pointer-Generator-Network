Fried chicken chain KFC famous for its 'finger lickin' good' slogan has been a mainstay on British high streets since 1965. 

Now almost 50 years since the opening of its first store, the fast food chain has gone upmarket with a snazzy makeover which aims to give a more homely atmosphere. 

A branch in Bracknell, in Berkshire, is the first of the country's 870 restaurants to undergo a revamp.

The KFC branch in Bracknell, in Berkshire, has undergone a revamp to create a more homely atmosphere

A new feature  is a semi-open plan kitchen that will allow diners to see their food being prepared

The red and white plastic has been replaced with brick-effect walls and timber tables, designed to replicate a 'kitchen as the heart of the home' image.

Commissioned artists will provide illustrations and photographs to adorn the walls - and the space will be brightly lit by low hanging copper lighting. 

A new feature added to the restaurants is a semi-open plan kitchen that will allow diners to see their food being prepared.

Its design should also allow service to be much faster.

Jade Swaby, KFC's creative design manager, said: 'We wanted the design to reflect the fact that, unlike many "fast food" restaurants, at KFC cooks prepare and make fresh food, from scratch, every day – so the sense of the kitchen being the heart of the home really influenced the authentic, inviting design.'

Founded by Colonel Harland D Sanders in Kentucky in the 1950s and known for its 'Finger Lickin' Good' slogan until it shortened this to 'So Good' three years ago, KFC has been on British high streets since opening its first UK outlet in Preston in 1965.

During the past decade KFC UK and Ireland has nearly doubled the number of chicken products it sells to £690m from £379m in 2004.

The new design hopes to create the sense of 'the kitchen being the heart of the home' 

Almost 50 years since the first store opened in the UK, a new design has been launched 

Sales of hot chicken wings have increased from £60m a year to £135m, while overall UK and Ireland revenues have nearly doubled from about £500m to close to £1bn.

Earlier this year it was revealed that KFC is planning to create up to 6,500 new jobs with the opening of 150 additional outlets in the UK and Ireland over the next five years.
