A California costume company has angered parents with costumes to dress infants up as marijuana leafs or cigarettes, but the designers say its all in good fun.

The provocative costumes are being sold by online costume retailer BrandsOnSale.com

'Halloween is one day out of the year you can dress up and be anything you’re not the other 364 days,' says company owner Johnathon Weeks.

Weeks told CBS Los Angeles his unique designs pull in millions of dollars in sales every Halloween season.

While admits the costumes aren't for everybody, he says the company always discusses designs before putting them into production to be sure they don't go too far. 

The company also sells costumes to dress up as characters from Mary Poppins, Gilligan's Island, the Addams Family, Elvis, and even some Disney princesses.

'We gave a roundabout discussion before we design and ask ‘Is this too much or pushing the envelope too far?’ he says.

But its the controversial costumes he says sell the best, with the pot leaf baby costume and cigarette outfit right up there with the Ebola response suit.

'We kind of know people are not going to be 100 per cent thrilled with it but it’s Halloween,' he said.

Still, there are parents who object.

'I would not want my grandkids in that,' said Cynthia Moreno.
