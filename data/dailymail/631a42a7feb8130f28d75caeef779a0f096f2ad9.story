Sigmar Gabriel has sparked an unwelcome debate

It was a call for road safety - but pleas for a speed-limit may have damaged one of Germany's political parties in their fight to challenge chancellor Angela Merkel.

The opposition centre-left Social Democratic Party have hit a bump in their campaign trail after its national chairman Sigmar Gabriel called for a national speed limit.

But his suggestion - based on his belief that a 75mph limit would reduce accidents and fatalities - has caused outrage.

Germany treasures its unrestricted autobahns that cover the country.

Now the SPD's candidate for German Chancellor, Peer Steinbrueck, is trying to quash the debate, as it could be a potential turnoff for voters.

Mr Gabriel was quoted last Wednesday as saying that a 75 mph (120 kph) autobahn limit would make sense because statistics suggest it would reduce serious accidents.

Mr Steinbrueck, whose party trails in the polls, told WDR television there already are limits on most of autobahns.

He said 'it's not the time to reignite this debate,' - perhaps in response to many voters enjoying the unrestricted limit, the Financial Times reported.

Mr Gabriel's only support for the suggestion came from the Green party, which backs a national limit, and the Traffic Club of Germany (VCD), which claims that 70 per cent of fatal road accidents occur on unrestricted sections of the autobahns.

Most European countries would welcome a speed limit.

The German's gaffe came after one of Britain's police and crime commissioner apologised after saying speed limits on motorways and main roads should be scrapped and skilled drivers allowed to drive as fast they like.

Stephen Bett who is independent PCC for Norfolk, was criticised in April after saying: ‘We ought to drive to road conditions rather than set limits.

'The problem is there’s so many signs.

'You are driving along and you get mesmerised by them and you get situations where you get a 50 [limit], to 40, to 30 and it goes to 20 and back up again.

'If we're going to do something about speed and villages, we ought to just take all the signs down and say all villages are 30mph, or whatever it’s going to be, and you drive on roads – like they do in Germany and Italy – as road conditions say.'
