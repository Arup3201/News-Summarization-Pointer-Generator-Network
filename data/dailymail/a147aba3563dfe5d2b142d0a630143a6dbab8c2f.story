Sunderland midfielder Sebastian Larsson has blasted his side's 'embarrassing' and 'shocking' performance against Aston Villa that had supporters heading for the exits even before half-time.

Gus Poyet's side were four down at the break as fans attempted to storm the Uruguayan's dugout in anger as Sunderland were plunged deeper into the relegation mire.

Poyet, who accepted responsibility for the defeat after the match, was sacked following talks with the club's hierarchy on Monday.

But Larsson insists it is the players who are to blame for the 4-0 drubbing at the hands of relegation rivals Villa.

'It's a shocker of a performance in the first half after a good start,' Larsson told the Sunderland Echo. 'All of us 11 players out there have to take the blame.

Midfielder Larsson insists it was the players that were to blame for the performance

'The goals we conceded in that first half were so avoidable, every single one.

'It's just a ridiculous amount of mistakes from all of us out there. Look at all four goals and none of them should be going in.

'That's the very, very frustrating thing.

'It's just embarrassing. For one bad goal to go in and for us to collapse the way we did, is absolutely shocking.'
