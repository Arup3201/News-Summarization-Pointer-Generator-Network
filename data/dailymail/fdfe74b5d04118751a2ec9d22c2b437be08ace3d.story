Jose Mourinho says he did not attempt to sign Luke Shaw because the teenager’s wage demands would have ‘killed the stability’ in Chelsea’s dressing room.

Shaw, 19, signed for Manchester United for £30million and is said to earn about £120,000 a week. Mourinho says that was too much for his club.

Just a kid: Mourinho says he didn't want to sign Shaw because of his extraordinary wage demands

‘If we pay to a 19-year-old boy what we were being asked for, for Luke Shaw, we are dead,’ said Chelsea’s manager. ‘We kill our stability with Financial Fair Play. We kill the stability in our dressing room.

‘Because when you pay that much to a 19-year-old kid — a good player, a fantastic player — the next day, me and (Chelsea director) Mrs Granovskaia and (technical director) Michael Emenalo get players knocking on our door and saying how is it possible that I play for this club 200 games and won this and that?

New mould: Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis joined Chelsea this summer, along with Didier Drogba

'How come a 19-year-old comes here and gets more money than I get? It would kill immediately our balance and we don’t allow that.

'Filipe Luis played for Brazil, won titles in Spain, won a European competition, played (in a) Champions League semi-final, this guy is much cheaper than an English young lad.

‘I don’t criticise the other clubs for paying it. But for my club, we can say it would be very negative.’
