Lance Armstrong has been told it would be ‘completely disrespectful’ to ride part of the Tour de France route this summer by the head of world cycling.

As revealed by the Mail on Sunday, Armstrong has agreed to a request by former England footballer and fellow cancer survivor Geoff Thomas to join him in raising money this summer in the battle against the deadly disease. Thomas and a team of cyclists will ride the Tour route one day ahead of the professional peloton and he travelled to Austin last month to persuade the controversial American to support the event for two stages.

But the initiative has divided opinion in cycling, with Sir Dave Brailsford suggesting Armstrong has already ‘done enough damage’ and UCI president Brian Cookson also urging the man stripped of his seven Tour titles for doping to stay away from France this summer.

Speaking at an event in London on Tuesday, Cookson said Armstrong ‘would be well-advised not to take part’ in the an event hoping to raise £1million for blood cancer.

‘I'm sure that Geoff Thomas means well, but frankly I think that's completely inappropriate and disrespectful to the Tour, disrespectful to the current riders, and disrespectful to the UCI and the anti-doping community,’ said Cookson.

‘I think Lance would be well-advised not to take part in that.’

Only a week after the CIRC report into cycling doping – ordered by Cookson – revealed that the use of banned substances is still a major problem in the sport, some might question whether professional cycling should even concern itself with a charity bike ride.

There are convicted dopers currently running pro Tour teams and right now the UCI is considering revoking the race licence of the Astana team that boasts last year’s Tour winner, Vincenzo Nibali, but has seen five of its riders test positive in recent months. It’s team manager, Alexander Vinokourov, is a convicted doper while questions continue at Team Sky over whether their employment of sporting director Servais Knaven represents a challenge to their zero tolerance policy. 

Travis Tygart, the head of the US anti-doping agency whose investigation ultimately brought down Armstrong, had no great objection to him rejoining the cancer battle. ‘As long as it's not a sanctioned competition that falls under the rules, it's not a direct concern,’ said Tygart, who only last week said he now feels ‘sorry’ for Armstrong and other riders in the light of the CIRC report into the doping culture in cycling and is now prepared to discuss reducing the American’s life ban from sport. ‘That's outside the technical rules.’

Christian Prudhomme, the Tour de France race director, also did not object to Armstrong’s involvement, making the point that he e would riding on public roads.

Cookson, meanwhile, challenged the charity argument. ‘I've heard that reason rolled out throughout Lance A's career as well,’ he said.

‘I'm not critical of people trying to raise funds for charity, let's be clear.

‘But I think maybe Lance could find a better way of continuing his fundraising efforts than this.

Lance Armstrong can ride his bike around France as often as he likes, it's got nothing to do with me or the UCI.’

Thomas responded with a statement, making it clear it is a fundraising issue and not a cycling issue.

The statement said: ‘When I was being treated for blood cancer I was inspired by Lance Armstrong’s book “It’s not about the bike, my journey back to life”. It gave me strength to deal with my predicament and a purpose which crystallised into the 2005 charity ride along the route of the Tour de France. Whatever Armstrong has done since, and I have gone on record condemning his use of performance enhancing drugs, this doesn’t remove the importance that he played at that critical period of my life.

'We have stayed in touch intermittently – he presented me with the Helen Rollason Award at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award in 2005 – and have had occasional chats over the last year about how he might support my charity endeavours. I went to see him a few weeks ago at his home in Austin and he genuinely wants to help improve the situation of those with blood cancer.

'We are still confirming details of how Armstrong will support Le Tour – One Day Ahead but it is likely to involve him riding a couple of stages and hosting a training camp for the team. I understand that some people will find it hard to accept Armstrong’s support but my take is a simple one: If Armstrong’s involvement in Le Tour - One Day Ahead and my goal to raise £1 million for blood cancer can help save one more life then surely that can only be a good thing.’

Armstrong issued a statement, saying: ‘I'm honoured and humbled to have been invited by legendary footballer and fellow cancer survivor Geoff Thomas to accompany him on parts of his ride around France.

‘Since my own diagnosis, I've been 100 percent committed to fighting this dreadful disease that affects millions, and that holds true today.’
