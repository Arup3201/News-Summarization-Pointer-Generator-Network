A couple have told of their horror after discovering an earwig inside a sealed bag of bread rolls picked up on their weekly supermarket shop.

Jane Naisbett, who bought the rolls at an Asda Superstore in Sunderland while shopping with her partner Gary MacPhail, said she was 'terrified' when she spotted the bug as she prepared to make some sandwiches.

'If I was partially sighted I might have eaten it,' the 53-year-old said.

Shock: The couple say there is no way the earwig could have got into the bag after they brought it home as it was still completely sealed

The disgusted couple, from Hendon in Sunderland, complained to the store on the Leechmere Road Industrial Estate, but Asda bosses say they could not fully investigate because the pair did not leave the item with them.

An inspection has since been carried out at the bakery but the supermarket said it found no evidence of insects.

Ms Naisbett and her partner Mr MacPhail, a 47-year-old council worker, said they bought the rolls fresh on Monday and put them straight into their freezer when they got home.

After removing them to defrost on Wednesday the couple say they found the earwig lurking inside the bag.

Disgust: Gary MacPhail and Jane Naisbett, seen with the bread rolls, say they will be taking their business elsewhere

Mr MacPhail said: 'Jane lifted out the pack of rolls to make some sandwiches and when they had defrosted there was earwig inside the bag.

'The bag is still completely sealed, there's no way it could have got in there,' he added.

Mr MacPhail claims he was offered a £5 voucher after taking the rolls back to Asda - although the store insists he was offered a £10 voucher as a goodwill gesture.

His partner said she would be taking her business elsewhere.

'I've shopped there for over 20 years,' Ms Naisbett said.

'But I won't be setting foot in there again.'

An Asda spokesman said: 'The quality of our products is our number one priority and we take any customer complaints incredibly seriously.

'We are at a loss to understand how this could have happened and unfortunately we were not given the opportunity to look at this product or investigate it properly.

'However, a thorough inspection of our bakery has found no evidence of any pests,' the spokesman added.
