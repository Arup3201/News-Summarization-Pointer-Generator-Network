Reading boss Steve Clarke will throw new loan signing Nathaniel Chalobah straight into an FA Cup debut at Cardiff.

Chelsea starlet Chalobah had his loan deal at the Madejski Stadium rushed through in time to play. And Clarke, who worked with the 20-year-old while assistant manager at Stamford Bridge, is eager to get him into action.

He said: ‘He will enhance our already strong midfield with his qualities, and we are delighted he chose to join us ahead of other clubs.’

Chalobah has already taken part in his first training session with the club 

Chalobah spent the first half of the season on loan at Burnley, but made only four appearances as a substitute.

Clarke added: ‘I’m hoping to bring in at least one and possibly two more players to strengthen the group.

‘I’ve got a good record in the FA Cup; winning it as a player in 1997 is one of the best moments of my career.

‘I have spoken to the group and made it clear that if you are lucky enough to get to the latter stages, everybody gets a lift from it.’
