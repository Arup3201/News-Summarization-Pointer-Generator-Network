A married mother and her firefighter lover plotted to kill her husband and then shot him dead, police have said.  

Jonathan Michael Hearn, 24, and Sabrina Limon, 35, were both arrested on Wednesday for the murder of her husband, 38-year-old Robert Limon.

Mr Limon, a rail worker with Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, was shot multiple times in his upper body on August 17 inside the building where he worked in Tehachapi, California.

After his death, his wife, with whom he had two children, expressed her grief on her Facebook page, calling him an 'AMAZING man' who 'will never be forgotten'.

But over three months of investigations, authorities discovered that she had actually been having an affair with Hearn before her husband was killed.

'Jonathan Heard had become involved in a romantic relationship with Sabrina Limon in the months leading up to Robert Limon's murder,' Ray Pruitt with the sheriff's department said.

'We are confident that the two people we arrested yesterday are responsible for his murder.' 

Authorities have not revealed how the pair met, although they both lived in the same area in the high desert, CBSLA reported.

Police are still appealing for help in the case.

They previously released surveillance footage showing a man walking through the railway building's yard around the time of the killing. He has not yet been identified.

Mr Limon had returned to the shop area after 5pm on August 17 after working in the field all day and was found killed that evening. 

'Hopefully somebody in the community will recognize the person of interest and we can talk to that person,' Pruitt said in August.

After his death, his wife paid tribute to him in a lengthy Facebook post. 

'The love he gave was more than some ever will feel or show,' she wrote. 'I will carry it with me where ever I go, and remind our children of it daily as they grow. It’s a feeling of joy, yet I’m totally numb to the fact that I’m left on earth now without him.'

Hearn and Sabrina Limon were both arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder, while Limon also faces accessory to murder charges. 

Friends expressed their shock that she could be involved.

Ellie Chandler, a family friend, told the Desert Dispatch that the Limons an 'all-American family' with a young son and daughter.

'They were what everybody wanted to be - just a happy family that had everything,' she said.

'Everybody loved to be around her. She was the life of the party. She had her group of friends that stayed with her every night to get her through this when Rob died. I’m just in shock.' 

Hearn had worked for the Redlands Fire Department since 2012 and was active at the time of his arrest, Carl Baker with the Redlands Police Department told KTLA. 

Redlands Fire Chief Jeff Frazier told the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin that his department learned about the arrest on Tuesday afternoon and Hearn was immediately placed on accrued leave.

He was not placed on administrative leave, which could cost the city more money, Frazier said.

Both are due in court Thursday in Bakersfield.
