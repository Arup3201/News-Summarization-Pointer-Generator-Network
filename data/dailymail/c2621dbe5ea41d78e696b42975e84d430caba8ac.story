A young mother claims she was told by doctors to Google her life-threatening condition after she spotted it mentioned on a doctor's note.

Roxanne Stacey was in hospital after having a cyst removed from her ovary.

The 24-year-old believed the operation would end the pain, vomiting and exhaustion she had been experiencing for weeks.

But as she prepared to leave hospital, she accidentally picked up a handover note meant for other nurses, thinking it was for her.

Reading the note when she got home, the mother-of-one spotted the words 'Wilkes syndrome' written in brackets beside details of her cyst removal.

Roxanne Stacey, 24, claims she only discovered she had life-threatening illness because she spotted it on a doctor's note - and was then told to 'go home and Google it' herself

Ms Stacey says doctors told her to research her rare illness Wilkes syndrome online after an X-ray confirmed she had the digestive disorder which causes a person to be unable to keep food down. As a result of the illness, she lost seven stone

She called her mother, who researched the condition online, and was horrified to learn it was rare and life-threatening. 

In those diagnosed with Wilkes syndrome, a major blood vessel in the digestive system lies on top of the small intestine, instead of behind it.

It means patients feel full quicker and struggle to keep any food down. 

If left untreated, it can prove fatal. 

Concerned, Miss Stacey took the nurse's note to her GP, who Googled the condition in front of her.

She claims, he said: 'There's no way you can have this syndrome, you'd be dead by now.' 

Miss Stacey, from Greenhithe, in Kent, said: 'I felt reassured but the symptoms persisted and I was losing weight by the day.'

She was prescribed medication to ease the pain and went for follow-up visits at Darent Valley Hospital.

It was an X-ray, taken in January this year, that confirmed Miss Stacey's diagnosis of Wilkes syndrome.

After specialists confirmed the illness,  Miss Stacey claims they told her to research the condition on Google.

She said: 'To add insult to injury, I was given the diagnosis and told to research it on Google.' 

Having been unable to digest food properly as a result of the syndrome, Miss Stacey's weight has plummeted to half what it was.

Miss Stacey said she was left so weak she was unable to hold her 16-month-old son Freddie, left

'I look anorexic,' she said. 'I used to be 14 stone and was healthy, and happy. Now I'm 7st 6lbs and I'm too weak for surgery.  

'I'm angry that I was left in pain to get on with it when the diagnosis was known in November.

'I'm too weak to hold my 16-month-old son Freddie.

'My partner Alex is taking unpaid leave from his job to help look after him.'

Darent Valley Hospital, in Dartford, Kent, referred Miss Stacey to a specialist last month and she said she is now receiving excellent care.

She was admitted to Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, in London, on March 8 so she can regain some strength and weight before having a life-saving operation.

A Darent Valley Hospital spokesman said: 'We are concerned to hear about Miss Stacey's experience however we have not received a complaint.

'Without being given the opportunity to look into the circumstances around her care, we are not able to respond to her particular concerns.

'If she would like to contact us, we will investigate and answer any questions she may have.'
