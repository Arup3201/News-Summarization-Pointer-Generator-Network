A group of women, outraged that a couple's gay wedding had been ruined by a homophobic bigot invited the happy couple back to California for a second ceremony. 

Gary Jackson and Oscar De Las Salas tried to get married on Cononado Island near San Diego almost two months ago when a man roared abuse at them from an apartment window. 

When a group of local women, described as 'The Island Ladies', heard about the incident, they emailed Jackson and De Las Salas and invited them back to their community to make amends.

Better still, the ladies arranged a new wedding ceremony for the couple and 300 guests, with local businesses donating towards the good cause. 

De Las Salas told NBC Los Angeles 'I hear [the heckling] and then he grabs me by the hand and said it’s alright we're ok,.'

According to Jackson: 'The ceremony was over, taking photos all we could think of was that guy and those condos where that person was staying.'

Local lawyer Alissa Kerr heard about the abuse and decided to act as she felt the homophobic abuse had no place in a community like Coronado. 

She established a Facebook page where local businesses made donations for the 'do-over ceremony'. 

De Las Salas added: 'What we're experiencing today is the biggest expression of love someone can have, the biggest expression of a community gathering themselves together to make it right.'

The second ceremony was held at the Loews Coronado Bay Resort in front of 300 guests - many of whom did not know the happy couple before the event.  

The couple, pictured, from Phoenix, Arizona, said they had no idea what to expect on their return to Coronado
