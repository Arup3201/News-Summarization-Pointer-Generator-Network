Police aren't expected to seek charges in the death of an Arizona man who was accidentally shot by his four-year-old son, authorities said.

Special Forces veteran Justin Stanfield Thomas, 35, was fatally shot on Friday after he and his son traveled from Phoenix to a friend's home 90 miles away in the northern Arizona community of Prescott Valley for a surprise visit.

The boy found the loaded gun in the home within minutes of arrival, asked a question about it and pulled the trigger, Prescott Valley Police spokesman Brandon Bonney said.

Killed: Justin Thomas, a former military policeman, was accidentally shot dead by his four-year-old son on Friday

Great dad: Thomas was an Iraq War veteran and a former member of the Army's Green Beret

Thomas was rushed to hospital but later died.

The child has been with his mother since the day the shooting occurred.

Bonney said the gun should have been 
locked away, but that Thomas' friend, whose identity hasn't been 
released, was caught off guard by the unannounced visit. No children 
lived in the house.

'They're processing everything to see
where they stand with the interviews and the crime scene investigation 
and see if everything is matching up,' Bonney told The Prescott Daily 
Courier.

The paper described Thomas as an Army special forces veteran who served in Iraq.

Jeremy Hart who lives next door and knew all the parties involved explained that his neighbor kept a loaded gun for protection.

Investigation: Police believe the kiling is just a tragic accident and no charges are expected

Dead: Justin Thomas passed away a short time after being shot. He had recently become a dad for the second time

Detectives are calling it a tragic mistake.

'At this point, it does appear that this is just a tragic accident from this child, and we will look to see if there's any negligence issues there,' said Prescott Valley police Sgt. Brandon Bonney.

'But, at this point, the information we have is it's just a tragic accident that was unforeseen.'

Friends say Justin Thomas used to live in Prescott Valley before moving to Phoenix.

Police say the boy, who is too young to comprehend what happened, is with his mother and his new born baby brother.
