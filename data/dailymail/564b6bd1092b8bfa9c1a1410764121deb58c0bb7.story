Swimming: Mr Chernyh said: 'The little cub didn't look so sure to begin with, it dipped its paw in the water and nearly ran back to its mother. It was a very funny to watch'

Getting tired: He continued: 'But it seemed very interested in the pool and you could see how eager it was to just jump in. Its mother, Gerda, seemed very relaxed'

'But it seemed very interested in the pool and you could see how eager it was to just jump in. Its mother, Gerda, seemed very relaxed about the whole affair. It is a very curious cub so it was only a matter of time before it ventured into the water.

'I am a regular visitor to the zoo and I feel as if I'm watching the little cub grow up. I felt amazing to get the moment on camera. Timing is everything when photographing animals.'
