A suspected paedophile allegedly beaten to death by a British ex-pat in Spain once acted as an assistant to Katie Price, it was claimed today.

Photographs have emerged showing Sandro Rottman with the model and her ex-husband Alex Reid in Sotogrande during the launch of her polo riding range in August 2009.

The German died in the same resort on Sunday after a British father named locally as Devinder Kainth, 40, caught him photographing his daughter on an iPad and attacked him.

A Briton, Fiona Goodwood – who has known Mr Rottman for the last 12 years and described him as 'something of an eccentric character' – said he told her he had assisted Miss Price on the trip.

It is claimed that Mr Rottman was very close to the entourage and was involved in organising the event.

Another British expat who has known Mr Rottman for eight years claimed he had 'attached himself to the couple' when Katie came to open her clothes line KP Equestrian in the  resort.

The source said: 'He had slick-backed hair and was always dressed very smartly'.

A spokeswoman for Miss Price told MailOnline: 'Katie was present at an event where Mr Rottman was working for the organisers. 

'She has no recollection of meeting him, but it appears she did during the course of her one day working trip to Sotogrande.

'This is clearly a tragic incident that will impact the families of all involved.'

It came after a disturbing picture emerged of Mr Rottman holding a young girl to his chest which he had posted on Twitter.

The 43-year-old, who who was arrested over child pornography a few days before his death, wrote: 'Just finished a day with the most beautiful girl in the Beach Club of Sotogrande. 

'Hope one day I will have one my own.'

Rottman was arrested on January 9 and, according to the Guardia Civil, the case was still open when he died, it was reported by Spanish daily newspaper El Pais. 

Kainth was having a family meal at a restaurant in exclusive Sotogrande, on the Costa del Sol in Spain, when he confronted Rottman after allegedly catching him taking pictures on his iPad. 

The millionaire, a keen boxer, hurled the iPad to the ground before punching the German, who died in hospital of his injuries.

Yesterday, details emerged of the attack on Saturday night.

The owner of the Spinnaker restaurant told the Mail: 'After an afternoon of friendly chatter, the British man suddenly told his family to leave. 

'Devinder looked at Sandro's iPad and found pictures of his family which had been taken earlier that evening. He was shouting: 'Why have you taken these?' 

'Suddenly he told his family to get out of the bar. Five seconds later, he hit Sandro so hard he fell to the floor. I think this knocked him out or at least dazed him.

'Then Devinder went crazy and started hitting Sandro. He must have hit him at least 20 times in the face and head.

'[Sandro] had blood gurgling from his mouth. He was choking and struggling to breathe. He also had a big lump on the side of his head – no other visible cuts – just this big lump.

'Then he was unconscious like he was in a coma. The waitress started screaming for help. 

'We were all shaking and trembling. When [Devinder] ran out of energy, he calmly got up and walked out the door.' 

Unsettling: Mr Rottman, 43, who was arrested over child pornography a few days before his death, had posted this image on Twitter showing him holding a young girl to his chest

A staff member who watched CCTV footage of the incident said: 'He dragged him along the floor like a dog.' 

Kainth was arrested and is being held at high security Botafuegos Prison, in the southern port of Algeciras.

His partner Gemma Hawkins, 31, the mother of his daughter and two sons, has been interviewed by police. 

There was no sign of her last night at their home or at the £8,000-a-year school of two of the children. 

Miss Hawkins, from Kent, was described as a 'blonde bombshell' who 'turned heads'.  

The millionaires' playground of Sotogrande is known for its large houses and golf courses such as the world-famous Valderrama Club. 

It is a favourite of former prime minister Tony Blair as well as the Duchess of York and her daughters Beatrice and Eugenie. 

The head chef at the Spinnaker restaurant where the incident took place is Austrian Philip Hannig, who spent a year training under Gordon Ramsay.   

According to witnesses, Mr Kainth and his partner, Gemma Hawkins, were eating with their three children (pictured, above, with Ms Hawkins) when they started chatting to Sandro Rottman

Two of the couple's children attend one of the most exclusive schools on the Spanish coast where fees are around 10,000 euros a year. The third goes to nursery

A worker at the nearby El Octogono Beach Club said the worrying photo on Mr Rottman's Twitter account was taken at its children's pool.

The barman, who asked not to be named, said the girl was the daughter of Britons who spend every summer there.

Of Rottman, a web designer, he said: 'He had a drink problem and would get through up to three bottles of vodka a day. 

'He's been banned for the past year because he ran up a huge bill. 

'He'd fallen on hard times after making a lot of money during the boom years in Spain when he was spending £50 a day on drink. He drank vodka and orange juice.

'He dressed well in smart trousers and a blazer even in the hard times. 

'He was always on his own and always on his computer because that was how he made his money, but I never saw him misbehaving.'

Rottman is said to have once been so drunk he fell into the sea and had to be rescued. He limped and is said to have been treated for a liver problem. 

A British man has been arrested for allegedly killing a German man he caught filming his young daughter in a restaurant in Sotogrande on Spain's Costa del Sol on Saturday night

The altercation happened at the The Spinnaker, pictured above, in Sotogrande on Spain's Costa del Sol on Saturday night after Devinder Kainth  reportedly saw Sandro Rottman filming his daughter

Kainth is a gym fanatic who worked out on most days and did gruelling Crossfit classes.

He has a three-bedroom house in the area and once owned a supermarket in nearby Casares, but it has closed, sources said.

The couple were said to be well known in the resort for their 'matching his-and-hers black and white Range Rovers' and their expensive spending habits.  

Ms Hawkins is also believed to be a fitness fanatic like her partner.

Various people in the resort have described her as a 'blonde bombshell' with a 'cracking body'.

A waitress in a restaurant in the resort said: 'When she walked into the restaurant all heads turned'. 

Another source added that she's 'better seen and not heard' and a 'real Cockney London girl'.

The family moved to Sotogrande full-time a year ago, although apparently they have been going to the resort for years. 

A neighbour said: 'The last time I saw him and his partner here was last August. They had an argument round the pool one day. 

'I couldn't understand what they were saying but he seemed very aggressive. His girlfriend left in tears and started throwing his clothes out of the window.' 

Kainth appeared before a magistrate on Monday and was remanded in custody accused of homicide.

The girl's father approached the man after seeing him filming with a tablet device, a source with the Civil Guard police force in Algeciras said
