Waterloo acting Judge Roger Barto was attacked from behind Saturday night with a toilet tank lid that had been placed in a nearby garbage container during building renovations, police said.

Officers found Barto lying near the front door of the courtroom entrance. He was taken to Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, where he's listed in serious condition.

Officials in the Finger Lakes village say Barto had been presiding over an arraignment for serious traffic violations, but police aren't connecting it to the beating.

The Village of Waterloo police department is housed in the same building as the court, according toCNY.

No arrests have been reported in the case.

Waterloo Police Officer James Chechak told that he was first to respond to the scene and that Barto told him that he believed there were two attackers. Barto regained consciousness shortly after the attack and called 911.
