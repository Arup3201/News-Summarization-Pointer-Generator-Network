While the pain of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting is felt across the nation, the sports world is no different - as several players took part in pregame ceremonies and honoring the victims in their own way.

Miami Heat star LeBron James, who has two children about the same age as Newtown, Connecticut's youngest victims, felt the pain of the parents who lost their kids when gunman Adam Lanza forced his way into the school and began firing.

James wrote 'Newtown, CT' in several places on his sneakers before the Heat took on the Washington Wizards in Miami last night.

The team also took part in a moment of silence to remember those who lost their lives, and some of the players - including James - brought their children onto the court with them.

James and teammate Dwyane Wade came up with the idea.

They said that if they were going to honor the victims of the shooting, then they wanted their own children to share in that solemn tribute.

James said: 'Basketball,
this is nothing. These games are nothing compared to when you have a 
tragedy like that. It sucks that sometimes you need a tragedy to put 
things back in perspective, to appreciate what you have.

'But it does that to people. It's 
unfortunate that you have to have something like that to understand 
what's really important and some things that aren't important at all. 
Family is the No. 1 important thing in life.'

James had 23 points and 10 rebounds, and the Heat never trailed on the way to handily defeating the Washington Wizards 102-72 on Saturday night.

'We were focused on the game,' teammate 
Dwayne Wade said. "We had heavy hearts for the families that dealt with 
the tragedy. But we had to play basketball, and... for our fans and our 
family we had to come out here and do our job.'

It was an emotional day in Miami, as 
it has been at just about every U.S. sports venue since the school 
shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, on Friday.

Several
Heat players spoke about how the massacre that left 20 children and six
adults dead at an elementary school affected them, and before tip-off 
on Saturday, Miami held a moment of silence.

'I couldn't imagine being in the position some people are in right now,' Bosh said. 'It wasn't like they were dropping their kids off in a dangerous situation. It was school.'

And the Miami Heat weren't alone, as several football teams will show their support for the small Connecticut community.

New York Giants receiver Victor Cruz wrote a personal message to one of his biggest fans - six-year-old Jack Pinto, who was killed along with several classmates when Lanza burst into his classroom.

Before the Giants took the field against the Atlanta Falcons, Cruz tweeted: 'Today's game is for you, Jack.'

Accompanying the Twitter message were photos of his cleats, which had messages dedicated to the boy, like 'RIP' and 'my hero.'

Both the Giants and New York Jets adorned their helmets with the letters 'S.H.E.S.' (Sandy Hook Elementary School).

The New England Patriots will also take the field with a special decal on their helmets, according to NFL.com.

The league has asked all home teams to observe a moment of silence before their games.
