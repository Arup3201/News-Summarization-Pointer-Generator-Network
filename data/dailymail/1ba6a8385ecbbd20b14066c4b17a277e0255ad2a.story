A West Texas man has been charged with impersonating a police officer by using sirens and flashing lights to skip to the head of the drive-thru line at a fast-food restaurant.

Odessa police say Michael Chico was arrested after an off-duty officer spotted a truck with law-enforcement trappings. 

Cpl. Steve LeSueur says Chico's vehicle looked like an unmarked police vehicle.

The officer who saw the truck cut in line on Saturday thought the driver, who was wearing a uniform, was a volunteer firefighter.

The officer followed Chico from the Whataburger to some nearby apartments.

LeSueur says that when confronted, Chico admitted he wasn't an officer and also that he used the lights and sirens to get through traffic lights.

Chico was freed Sunday on $15,000 bond.
