A West Coast Delta 4 rocket is launched with a NROL-25 payload

A rocket carrying a top-secret payload blasted off from the
California coast yesterday.

The Delta IV rocket lifted off from the Vandenberg Air Force
Base, about 130 miles north west of Los Angeles.

The rocket contained some form of spy technology - thought to be a hi-tech replacement for America's ageing fleet of radar satellites.

It's not clear what capabilities the new generation might be armed with.

Observers think that the 'new generation' spy satellites would be capable of high-resolution scans even through cloud cover and at night.

Since the launch involved a classified cargo for the
National Reconnaissance Office, no details were immediately available about
whether it was boosted to its intended orbit.

The reconnaissance office, which oversees the nation's
constellation of spy satellites, has kept mum about the purpose of the mission
and directed United Launch Alliance to cut off the live broadcast three minutes
after lift-off.

‘We've just seen the successful lift-off’ ,
launch commentator Don Spencer said in a webcast.

Intelligence analysts think the rocket carried a radar
imaging satellite capable of seeing at night and through bad weather.

In recent years, the United States has worked to phase out
its fleet of older, heavier radar reconnaissance satellites with smaller but
equally capable ones, said Charles Vick, a space policy analyst with the
Globalsecurity.org think tank.

Such radar satellites would be able to zero in on countries
of interest and see details that typical Earth satellites cannot, experts said.

The launch involved reconfiguring the rocket to add on two
strap-on boosters to provide more thrust. The protective nose cone enclosing
the payload also had to be made larger.

The U.S. spy satellite agency blacked out the broadcast after three minutes

Its exact 'classified' cargo has not yet been revealed, with the National Reconnaissance Office keeping mum about the purpose of the mission

No information was available about whether the satellite had reached its orbit successfully after the spy-satellite agency blacked out the broadcast

The National Reconnaissance Agency has has launched several satellites using Delta IVs in the past two years, including four launches at Cape Canaveral, Florida.Capable of generating nearly two million pounds of thrust, the liquid-fuel rocket has a central core booster and two strap-on boosters that make the assembly 50ft wide.An upper second stage takes over when the first stage is exhausted.
