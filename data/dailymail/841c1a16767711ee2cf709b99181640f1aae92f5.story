Hungry: The British Red Cross is to distribute food to poorer families for the first time since the Second World War in a bid to tackle food poverty

The British Red Cross is to start distributing food to hard-up families for the first time since the Second World War as it warned that thousands face cuts to their household budgets.

Volunteers from the charity will go into supermarkets from next month to ask shoppers to donate tinned and dry food to be passed on to families facing food poverty.

The charity blamed a combination of the recession, welfare cuts and the increased cost of living for more UK families struggling to put food on the table.

It described its campaign as a 'toe in the water' as it considers further steps to tackle the growing problem of food poverty.

Once food is collected from shoppers, it will be passed on to the most needy through the FareShare charity.

Juliet Mountford, the charity's head of UK service development, said the Red Cross agreed to assist FareShare on the basis of 'strong evidence of an increased need for support on food poverty issues'.

Nearly 500,000 people in the UK needed support from food banks last year, according to figures from the Trussel Trust.

Last month a report shed light on the chronic throw-away culture affecting the food industry, where up to two-fifths of a crop of fruit or vegetables can be wasted because it is 'ugly'.

Produce grown in the UK that does not meet retailer standards on size or shape or is blemished is often used for animal feed or simply ploughed back into the ground even though it is edible, with as much as 40 per cent of a crop rejected.

The report, commissioned by the UK's global food security programme, also showed that the average household throws away more than 5kg (11lb) of food per week, and nearly two-thirds of that is avoidable.

The waste costs £480 a year per household on average, and £680 per family. Households throw away a fifth of the food they buy, wasting it for reasons ranging from cooking and preparing too much to not using it before it goes off, the study showed.

Campaign: Red Cross volunteers will be asking people shopping in supermarkets to donate some food to the campaign

Consumption and initial production are the areas where the majority of food is wasted in the UK, the study said.

According to a Red Cross report released today the number of people relying on food aid has increased by 75 per cent across Europe over the last three years with an estimated 43 million struggling for enough food to eat.

A further 120million are at risk of poverty, according to the Independent.

Bekele Geleta, the Secretary General of the International Federation of the Red Cross, warned governments on the continent against 'indiscriminate cuts' to health and social care funding.
