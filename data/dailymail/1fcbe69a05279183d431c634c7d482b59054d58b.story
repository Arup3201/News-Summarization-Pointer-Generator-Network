Amazing photographs, captured in vivid colour, show life in Russia in the early 1900’s as the country stood on the brink of the First World War - and revolution.

Photographer Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky was one of the nation’s leading photographers at the beginning of the Twentieth Century. He was commissioned to capture a photographic record of Russia after the monarch saw his colour portrait of Leo Tolstoy.

The portrait of Tolstoy, taken in 1908, just two years before the author's death, was Prokudin-Gorsky's most famous work and became widely popular and was reproduced on postcards, large prints and in various publications.

The photographer was commissioned by Tsar Nicholas II to travel around Russia capturing images of the nation in the early years of the 1900s, in full colour

In order to capture the scenes in colour, Prokudin-Gorsky had to take three photos, each time with a different colour filter over the lens, which meant that sometimes, when subjects moved, the colours would blur and distort - as seen in this image

It also caught the eye of the royal family and Prokudin-Gorsky was invited to present his work to Tsar Nicholas II and his family in 1909.

The Tsar was so impressed with the photographs he commissioned him to travel across Russia, documenting the nation in colour images. The project was supposed to run for 10 years and see Prokudin-Gorsky collect 10,000 photos.

During 1909-1912, and again in 1915, Prokudin-Gorsky completed surveys of 11 regions, travelling in a railroad car provided by the government which was equipped with a darkroom.

Prokudin-Gorsky, who was born into an aristocratic family in St Petersburg in 1863 and studied chemistry and art, was granted access to areas of Russia that were forbidden to everyday citizens. This allowed him to document Russia’s people and landscapes at the beginning of what would be a dramatic century for the nation.

The photographer was able to capture the scenes in colour, allowing the audience a vivid sense of what life looked like, through using a three-colour technique. This involved taking three separate photographs, one with a red filter, one with a green filter, one with a blue filter.

These monochromatic images would then be projected through filters of those same colours on to a screen and superimposed. When seen through a final filter, they would appear amazingly realistic.

Prokudin-Gorsky began implementing his three-colour method after studying under German photochemist Adolf Miethe

After leaving Russia in 1918, Prokudin-Gorsky moved to Germany, where he remarried and had a daughter, Elka. He then moved to Paris and was reunited with his first wife and three adult children, with whom he started a photography studio

Prokudin-Gorsky learnt the method in 1902 when he travelled to Berlin to study under the photochemist Adolf Miethe.

Using this method, Prokudin-Gorsky became a well-regarded photographer and was appointed as editor of Russia’s most important photography journal, the Fotograf-Liubitel.

He was not able to finish his ten-year, 10,000-print project. After the October revolution in 1917, Prokudin-Gorsky was offered a professorship under the communist regime, but a year later he left Russia for good.

By this point he had created an estimated 3,500 negatives, but many of these were confiscated when he left the country and only 1,902 have been recovered. These were purchased by the U.S. Library of Congress in 1948 and published in 1980.

Prokudin-Gorsky fled to Germany and then Paris, where he married his lab assistant and had a daughter, Elka.

In Paris, he was reunited with his three adult children and first wife, Anna Aleksandrovna Lavrova, with whom he remained on good terms until his death in 1944. He continued his photographic work, including setting up a studio in Paris and publishing papers in English photography journals.

The studio, which he set up with and bequeathed to his three adult children, was named Elka, after his youngest daughter.

He died in Paris in 1944, a month after the liberation of France from Nazi-occupation.

Can't sit still: This image shows how difficult it was to capture colour at the time. If any of the children moved while the three different photographs were taken the colour would blur

Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky was one of the most famous photographers in Russia at the time. He was the editor of the country's leading photographic journal and continued to contribute to journals around the world once he left Russia
