A confectionery giant was out Smartie-d by a seven-year-old schoolgirl who spotted an embarrassing spelling blunder on a tube of sweets. 

Eva Ball was enjoying her favourite chocolate treat when she saw the gaffe on the packaging.

The question on the tube read: 'What T might you look at the stars trough?'

Makers Nestlé congratulated the youngster after she rightly spotted they had missed out an 'h'.

'She came running in saying “I've found a spelling mistake,”’ said mother-of-four Allison, 45. 

'I thought she couldn't be right but when I looked she was.

'It should be "through" - they've missed the "h" out. Not a good advert for spelling on children's sweets.

'Eva loves her Smarties and she also loves to read. She is fantastic at it and reads above her age level.

'She reads all kinds of packaging including things like the tomato sauce bottle.

'She was overjoyed when she found it. She was so chuffed with herself. She has still got the tube and won't eat the Smarties.'

The schoolgirl from Sheffield, South Yorkshire wrote to chocolate giants Nestlé and received a reply littered with adult business jargon.

'They sent a very corporate letter back,' said Mrs Ball.

'I thought they might have taken a bit more time and written it more for a seven-year-old.'

Nestlé has since sent the schoolgirl a £2 voucher to thank her for her efforts, but managed to spell her mother's name wrong in the letter.

Eva's father David, a motorcycle dealer, said: 'Eva's a little bookworm. The school have put her on the register for the gifted and talented so it's been recognised that she's very talented in that area. She's very clever.'

A spokesman for Nestlé said: 'A good spot from Eva. The tube was corrected at the end of last year and the updated packs should be in stores now.

'Smarties may have all the answers but not necessarily the right questions.' 

Nestlé are not the only ones to make embarrassing spelling errors. 

In December last year police chiefs in South Yorkshire were left embarrassed after taking delivery of a new patrol car with POLCE emblazoned on the side.

In April 2013 council workmen somehow managed to spell 'school' wrong outside Innellan Primary School, near Dunoon, in Scotland. They painted 'sckool' on the road instead.

Oxfordshire council workers misspelled 'school' as 'schoul' in traffic markings in March 2012

Bungling workers were slammed in February 2013 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, after they erected a sign for a historic Welsh bridge - but misspelled it 'Whelsh'. 

In March 2012, Oxfordshire council workers misspelled 'SCHOOL' as 'SCHOUL' in traffic markings outside Wolverton Primary School.

A sign made by Hertfordshire Highways in February 2012 instructed motorists to 'Keer Cleap.'
