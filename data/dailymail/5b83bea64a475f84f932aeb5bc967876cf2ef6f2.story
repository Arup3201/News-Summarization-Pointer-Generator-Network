The letters offer a glimpse into the mind and emotions of naturalist Charles Darwin

Charles Darwin's grief over watching his daughter-in-law's painful death days after giving birth to his first grandchild is laid bare in personal letters soon to be released online.

The naturalist's horror at watching Amy Darwin die in September 1876 is described in a series of letters he wrote to his best friend, the botanist Joseph Hooker.

He wrote: 'I am sure you will pity us, when you hear that Amy, Francis' wife was safely confined and was apparently going quite well when she was seized with convulsion which lasted for several hours, she then sunk into a stupor and I saw her expire at 7 o'clock this morning.'

The fascinating letters, which have never yet been published, are to be published by Cambridge University by its Darwin Correspondence Project later this month.

Darwin's daughter-in-law, Amy, was 26 when she died four days after giving birth to the naturalist's first grandchild, Bernard.

The child survived, and was brought up by his father, Francis, and his paternal grandparents.

Francis, who worked closely with his father, was later said by Bernard to have never recovered from watching his beloved wife die.

Charles Darwin described her as 'a most sweet, gentle creature, with plenty of mind beneath,' and wrote: 'Thank God she... never knew that she was leaving Frank and all of us for ever.

'I cannot think what will become of Frank.  She helped and encouraged him in his scientific work and whether he will ever have heart to go on again...I cannot conceive.

'My Dear Old Friend, I know that you will forgive me pouring out my grief'.

Darwin was particularly close to Amy, 
who shared his interest in naturalism and was married to the one his 
seven children who most closely followed in his own footsteps.

Francis, known as Frank, had recently decided against pursuing a career in medicine and had settled in the Kent village of Down, where his parents lived, and begun work as Darwin's personal secretary, assisting him with botanical research and correspondence.

The four-page letter from Charles Darwin to his friend Joseph Hooker tells of his daughter-in-law's death

'I cannot think what will become of Frank': Darwin writes of his worries for his bereaved son

Hooker replied: 'My dear, dear Darwin, I cannot tell you how I feel for Frank and Mrs Darwin and yourself.

'It seems to open up my own all too recent loss, and to depress me utterly - poor, poor Frank, my heart bleeds for him: they were so happy and she so loveable - how I envied them a few months ago!'

Darwin then wrote to Hooker a few days later, saying: 'Poor Amy had severe convulsions due to wrong action of the kidneys; after the convulsions she sunk into a stupor from which she never rallied.

'It is an inexpressible comfort that she never suffered & never knew she was leaving her beloved husband for ever.

'It has been a most bitter blow to us all.'

He added: '  I never saw anyone suffer so much as poor Frank. He has gone to N. Wales to bury the body in a little church-yard amongst the mountains, & I do not know when he will return'.

Paul White, who edits the Project, told MailOnline that Amy 'was a favourite with all the Darwin family'.

He said: 'Darwin's letter to Hooker after Amy's death also suggests the closeness that he feels for his son. This was very characteristic of Darwin, who always showed a great deal of concern for his children and was frequently anxious about their future happiness.'

The letters show another, deeply personal side to the naturalist Charles Darwin, who wrote The Origin Of Species

Dr White added: 'Hooker was Darwin's closest friend and they corresponded over almost their entire adult lives, so there was a kind of bond there that was special.

'They shared feelings which they didn't share with others, so this correspondence offers a wonderful insight into what it was like to be them.  It shows us Darwin from the inside rather than the public Darwin.

'When there are moments of crisis they do share these moments with each other.'

Francis went on to marry again twice, and his son Bernard went on to be educated at Eton and Cambridge before becoming a golf writer.

Darwin and Hooker, a botanist and explorer who later ran the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, had both lost children previously, and had poured out feelings to each other that they had not been able to tell others.

The historic papers form part of the world's largest collection of Darwin's papers - some 9,000 letters - and will be released on the Darwin Correspondence Project website later this week.
