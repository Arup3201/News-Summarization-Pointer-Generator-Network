A pioneering crook got away with £24,000 after 3D printing fake cashpoints facades, only to be caught because he used his own card to test them out.

The thief, named Hamid P, used the printer to make fake fronts for ATM machines so he could clone hundreds of people's cards.

When unsuspecting members of the public put their cards into the cashpoints in Nimes and Saint-Ambroix, southern France, they also put them through a 'skimmer' which was hidden by the 34-year-old fraudster.

Skimmers register card details and were found behind the fake machine fronts that Hamid P had secretly installed.

The machine would then dispense cash as normal, leaving the user completely unaware that their details had been stolen.

A police source told Le Parisien: 'The fake fronts were of a good quality and were different to those we normally see.'

Hamid P was on the run with £24,000 of stolen money before the scam came to light when the bank discovered the false fronts.

Police tracked him down as he had used his own credit card in the machine to test whether it worked.

He was arrested in Marseille this month.

When the police found the 3D printer at his home he admitted to the scam and has been charged with fraud.

In September 2011 an American gang were prosecuted after stealing more than £241,000 by using the same 3D-printed fake ATM fronts scam.

A gang in Australia were also caught out after scamming £56,000 from card users with a similar ploy.

Criminals have also used the revolutionary printers to make keys and guns.

However the machines have been put to good use too, to make objects including houses, replacement knees, and even 'mini-me' models.

3D printers, such as this CubeX Trio, can now be bought for home use. It is thought that the thief used a much larger 3D printer to make the fake ATM fronts, which were used in Nimes and Saint-Ambroix, southern France
