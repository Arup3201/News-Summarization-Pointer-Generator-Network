Massachusetts is giving up on its health exchange website.

State officials have decided that it would be cheaper to abandon the state's Health Connector website than it would to fix it, reports The Boston Globe.

The state is now looking at other ways to sign up its uninsured residents for healthcare ahead of the next open enrollment period that begins November 15.

Massachusetts' Health Connector site was
 created by CGI Federal - the same company that created the glitchy 
federal Obamacare sign-up site healthcare.gov.

Much like its federal counterpart, mahealthconnector.org, has not worked properly since it went live in October 2013. Many Massachusetts residents were unable to sign up for health care online, and instead had to fill out paper applications.

As a result of the hiccups with its website, Massachusetts asked the federal government in early February to exempt it from the nationwide March 31 deadline to sign up for qualifying health care plans. It asked that the Obama administration give it until September 30, and at the very least, until June 30.

'We spent a lot of money. Some of it may be federal, but it’s all 
taxpayer money however it’s collected. We spent a lot of money for 
something that doesn’t work,' state senator Richard Moore, a Democrat, told Mass Live at the time. 'It’s a wonder we
 don’t have as series of mental health crises because of people’s 
frustration.'

The Bay State's Health Connector board was supposed to meet later this week to decide whether it would get rid of Massachusetts' health exchange entirely and feed residents into the federal exchange, the Boston Herald reported on Friday.

However, the state official tasked with overseeing the site said on Monday that Massachusetts would pursue a 'dual track' approach to providing its uninsured residents with healthcare.

The state will first look into purchasing a customized version of the state health insurance platform sold by health information and technology company hCentive. If it is not able to get its own exchange up and running quick enough, it will feed enrollees into the federal health exchange.

'I’ve said all along that no option on the table would be perfect, and the dual track certainly has its benefits and its challenges,' said health care Sarah Iselin, an insurance industry executive who was hired on a temporary basis by Democratic Governor Deval Patrick in February to fix the site.

'It does, however, solve for two realities: we need a reliable website to help people during the next open enrollment period, and we need to be in a position to achieve a fully integrated system in 2015,' Iselin, who is scheduled to return to her job at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts this month, told The Boston Globe.

On its website, hCentive boasts'reduced implimentation costs' and a 'shorter implimentation cycle' as part of its state exchange program.

'Our browser-based, user-configurable solutions are being adopted by different healthcare plans and organizations to enhance their processes and ensure compliance with healthcare reforms without significant cost or IT infrastructure,' the website says.

It does not say on its site how much the program costs or what other states are using it.

The Virginia-based company did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment.

'You can¿t help but admit it¿s a failure,' House Minority Leader Bradley Jones Jr., a Republican, said of Massachusetts' Health Connector website last week

Oregon became the first site to ditch it's health exchange and join healthcare.gov last month after spending $305 million to build and promote its Cover Oregon site.

Massachusetts has spent at least $57 million on its site, Politico reports. The total amount of taxpayer money Massachusetts has spent on its failed health exchange site is not public. Members of the state's house passed legislation on Friday requiring Governor Patrick's office to disclose that information. It now awaits approval in the state senate.

'You can’t help but admit it’s a failure,' House Minority Leader Bradley Jones Jr., a Republican, said of the Health Connector website last week.

'It’s an abject failure that’s going to cost the taxpayers, whether it’s the commonwealth of Massachusetts or money from the feds or rate-payers, tens of millions of dollars that shoudn’t have happened.'

The federal government spent $93.7 million on building Health Connector's botched sister site healthcare.gov. It is paying $121 million to fix it.

Health Connector spokesman Jason Lefferts said he expected information on the cost of Massachusetts' site to be provided by the Patrick administration 'sooner than July.'
