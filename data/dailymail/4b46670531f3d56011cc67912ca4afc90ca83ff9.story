Sex crimes unit detectives have interviewed bar staff and customers at a local hotel in Batemans Bay in an effort to hunt down a man who punched a woman to the ground in a public toilet and then raped her as  her six-year-old daughter cowering in the next cubicle.

The brutal assault happened at 4pm on Thursday in the quiet seaside town on the NSW south coast, after the 37-year-old mother had picked her daughter up from school and had taken her to play on the equipment at Lions Park.

While she was waiting for her daughter in the toilet block, an unknown man entered the toilet block and approached her.

The woman managed to stay calm and ask her daughter to stay in the toilet cubicle with the door locked, before the man punched her.

Knocked to the floor of the toilet block, the woman lost consciousness while he raped her,  coming to while he still lay on top of her.

The woman, who is believed to be a local area resident, noticed the man's grubby white t-shirt, his bad body odour and breath, and the distinctively frayed and faded cap he was wearing.

Police have released an artist's impression of the hat worn by the man who sexually assaulted a 37-year-old mother in a public toilet block Batemans Bay in southern NSW on November 27

The man fled and the woman raised the alarm and was rushed to Moruya Hospital for treatment, and then released.

The six-year-old daughter was not injured in the attack and is understood to not be fully aware of what happened.

Shocked locals are disturbed that a woman in their usually quiet community, a popular holiday destination 280km south of Sydney, could fall prey to such a brutal and random sexual assault.

'This is normally a safe place and so a lot of people are talking about it,' a manager at the nearby Bayview Hotel said, 'detectives have come in and interviewed quite a few people, so perhaps someone will recognise the description.'

The hotel and other local businesses have put up poster of an image of the rapist's distinctive hat, issued by police using the victim's detailed description.

The man police are looking for is described as being about 175cm tall with a medium build, a rounded stomach and an olive complexion.

His baseball cap was frayed, tattered and a faded blue  that detectives believe could be the key to identifying the man.

The front brim was worn through to reveal the dark blue colour of the original fabric underneath, while on the top of the cap the material had split and worn to the extent that the button on the crown of the cap had worn through to the silver base.

'I think it would be fair to describe this as a brutal crime with extreme violence,' Detective Sergeant Nick Sprowles from the Sex Crime Command said.

'We have never heard of something like this happening before. No one knows what happened, no one saw a thing,' one business owner told Daily Mail Australia.

'I was really shocked when police told me. We never expected anything like that in the day time.

'We're all baffled. When we go into town we go under the bridge and right past the toilets all the time. This is the first time (it's happened), that's for sure.

'I'm sure the poor woman is very traumatised. She came from school to go to the park and was taking her kid to the toilet... it's just a very sad thing.'

The toilet where the attack took place has been described as 'dingy' and the park and surrounding area don't have any lights or CCTV cameras.  

The woman had taken her young daughter into the toilets (pictured) and was waiting for her when she was approached by an unknown man who knocked her unconscious to the floor and then raped her

While police initially believed the woman was indecently assaulted, medical tests have since revealed she was sexually assaulted while she was unconscious.

The park where the woman was attacked is heavily populated with both tourists and local residents.

'When it’s good weather, a lot of people come with their kids. There’s quite a few people always in the park,' a resident said. 

Detectives said the park was no more of a concern than any other park in the area.

Detectives in the sex crimes squad investigating the attack have now renewed their appeal for witnesses. 

She told detectives she asked her daughter to stay in the toilet cubicle with the door locked, before she was punched and knocked unconscious

While police initially believed the woman was indecently assaulted, medical tests have since revealed she was sexually assaulted while she was unconscious 

He was also wearing a grubby white T-shirt, shorts and dirty white sneakers. 

The woman told police he also had a strong body odour and bad breath, and smelt of cigarettes and alcohol.

Police want to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of the attack, as well as anyone who might have seen a man fitting the description in the area in recent months.

Due to a phone fault at Batemans Bay Police Station in late November, police are also appealing for anyone who was unsuccessful in contacting the station after the first media appeal to call again.

Anyone with information should call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
