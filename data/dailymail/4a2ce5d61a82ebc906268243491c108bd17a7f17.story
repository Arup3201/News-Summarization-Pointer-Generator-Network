This is the shocking moment a foreign driver ran over a group of British tourists as they celebrated Spain's Euro 2012 win in Magaluf.

The motorist bounced over the bodies of the fallen holidaymakers in his Range Rover before nonchalantly driving off as if he had gone over a speed bump.

Joe Worsnop, 20, was seriously injured as he partied on the Spanish holiday resort's main strip with a group of friends. His twin brother James was also hurt.

Footage of the group partying in the street as they were knocked down by the car was caught on camera and posted on YouTube.

A mob further down the street reportedly smashed the vehicle's windscreen as it was driven off after witnessing the incident.

Police later arrested a 37-year-old Spanish man and forensic tests are being carried out on the vehicle.

The holidaymakers were celebrating Spain's 4-0 win over Italy in the Euro 2012 final in the early hours of Monday morning when the incident happened.

The emergency services were called and Joe's twin brother James telephoned their mother, Trish, from the back of the ambulance at home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, to tell her what had happened.

James was kept in hospital for two days after suffering a gash to his back that needed 17 stitches.

But his much more seriously injured 
brother was in so much pain he was flown home before being taken to Bradford Royal Infirmary after his wounds became 
infected.

Speaking from his hospital bed, the Kwik-Fit mechanic, who turns 21 on Sunday, said: 'I didn't see the car at first.

'I thought someone had punched me to the floor but when I turned my head all I saw was the Range Rover plate and it was too late, the other wheels went over me.

'I'm just glad to be home. It was the scariest moment of my life but now I feel I'm the luckiest man alive, I'm so lucky to be here.'

The mechanic has since written on Facebook:  'The next time I'm under a Range Rover's wheels I want to be working on them, not wearing them.'

His friend Michael McDonald, 20, was also hit by the car but managed to escape with minor injuries.

Mr McDonald said: 'We'd been coming down from another bar when there were hundreds of people in the street in front of us all chanting football songs.

'A police car came through and let off tear-gas to clear the crowds. Some people did go and things had calmed down but then I was suddenly on the deck and realised I'd been run over, I'd been hit. We heard the driver was arrested eventually but the police are apparently just treating it as an accident.'

Danny Nolan, 21, was struck a glancing blow by the Range Rover but he escaped with cuts and grazes.

He said: 'I was just inches from going under the car. A bloke who'd been in front of the car and tried to stop him knocked me out of the way as he fell under.

'We're staying on until Sunday but can't wait to get home. It's not the same without Joe, we want to see how he's getting on.'

Glyn Hirst, also 21, said: 'This car just came up and mowed people down. The driver got impatient. I felt sick, I couldn't look at first but then I had to go and find my mates.

'The car ran about five people over then stopped for a few seconds. I saw a guy in front of it put his hands on the bonnet but the driver just kept going and went over him and the other guy was still under his tyres.

'That poor guy's still in intensive care. He was begging his mates "don't let me die".'

The men had been part of a group of 15 Bradford friends who had flown out to Magaluf for a week.

A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed its officials were aware of an incident in Magaluf resulting in three British nationals needing hospital treatment and the consul's help.
