Manuel Pellegrini refused to criticise rookie referee Tasos Sidiropoulos and insisted Manchester City had only themselves to blame for their 2-1 defeat by CSKA Moscow on Wednesday night.

City were 2-1 behind and down to 10 men after substitute Fernandinho had received a harsh second booking when Pontus Wernbloom, who had already been booked, tugged Sergio Aguero back.

Referee Sidiropoulos, who was taking charge of only his second Champions League game, immediately reached for his yellow card but showed it to Sergei Ignashevic instead of Wernbloom in an apparant case of mistaken identity.

Man City captain Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure pointed out the error to the Greek official but their appeals were waved away.

A few minutes later a frustrated Toure pushed Roman Eremenko to the floor and was shown a straight red card.

Asked for his opinions on the moments of controversy, Pellegrini said: 'I think it is not my duty to analyse the referee's performance. It is your duty to decide if he made a good decision or bad decision.

'Today the difference was not just the mistakes of the referee. I think we cannot play the way we played today if we want to win.

'I don't want to have any excuse about the way we played. That's why I don't want to link the referee with the result.'

Pellegrini refused to comment on the Fernandinho and Toure red cards, but said he needs to get a better performance from his side if it is to reach the knockout stages of the competition.

'It's a crisis of confidence, of course, I don't understand why but we must find a reason, talk with the players every day and try to win again,' Pellegrini said.

The result leaves City bottom of Group E with just two points and facing a mountain to climb to reach the next stage with remaining games against Bayern Munich and Roma.
