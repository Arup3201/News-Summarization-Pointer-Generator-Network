Women are enrolling on DIY courses to improve their homes and set up their own businesses

Rising numbers of women are turning to DIY and skilled trades amid the recession, it has been revealed.

They are enrolling on training courses to learn crafts such as plastering, decorating, plumbing and tiling.

Some want to save money by improving their own homes while others are setting up their own businesses after being made redundant or opting for career changes.

DIY workshops across the country organised by B&Q have experienced a five-fold increase in female take up in the last year.

Over 3,200 enrolled in classes to learn skills such as plastering, wall tiling, changing taps and hanging wallpaper in July 2012 compared to 592 at the same point last year.

There was a 92 per cent increase between January and July this year alone - up from 1,698.

A B&Q spokeswoman said: 'Whether it's to save money, avoid being ripped off or to just increase confidence around the home, women are skilling up.'

Statistics show that women are also embarking on training to allow them to enter the male dominated skilled trades sector.

JTL, the leading training provider to the building services sectors, has seen a five-fold increase in demand from women apprentices.

Just six women signed up for plumbing or electrical apprenticeships in 2001 compared to 30 in 2010.

And around 600 women are currently registered with the Gas Safe Register, which means they can legally carry out gas work. In April 2009, the figure was around 500.

Meanwhile UK Trades Training, based in South Shields, had just one woman turning up for a tiling course in 2004.

It now gets up to 30 a year enrolling in training for trades including tiling, plastering, bathroom installation and kitchen fitting.

Some womenhave been made redundant from careers as diverse as banking to events managing or have previous been stay at home mothers who have gone on to set up their own companies.

The economic downturn persuaded Sue Corentin to turn her love of DIY into a full-time job.

The 58-year-old became passionate about it when she single-handedly decorated her parent's home when she was just 18.

She started taking her enjoyment of decorating, painting and fixing things around the house seriously when her former husband â€“ who she said 'couldn't even fit a light-bulb' - bought her an expensive tool kit for Christmas.

She said: 'I think it was the best present I ever received and that's when I started thinking about doing it as a profession.'

But it wasn't until the recession took hold three years ago and she found herself needing to make extra cash quickly that she took her first job at a building company, fixing doors, fitting door-handles and locks.

The mother of two from Hayes, Middlesex, said she has been lucky not to experience sexism in the industry, but added that people often find it difficult to get their head around seeing a woman.

'When I started that first job I was working with all men. They couldn't believe it when they first met me and discovered I was a woman.

Ms Corentin, whose business is called 'Sue's Home Improvements' said more women should discover DIY.

Director Tracy Yorke said: 'Our ladies don't tend to go and work on building sites. They run their own businesses going into domestic homes.

'We've definitely seen an increase in women coming in who've been made redundant and are having to look at other choices and why not?

'We've never found that anything's a barrier for them in the training side of things.

'You don't have to be a great big tradesman to be good at something. I have women coming in who are quite slight but they have no problems in terms of the demands of the courses.'

She added: 'Running a business is also about doing a good job and winning the work. If you're going into a domestic market, you don't just get one quote.

'You have to be knowledgeable and be able to interact and make sure you're the right person for the job. Customer service is a massive thing, which women are often very good at.'

Sue Jefferson, 35, enrolled on painting, decorating, tiling and plastering courses with the company last year after taking voluntary redundancy from her local government post, organising activities for elderly people.

She set up PoppySue's Handy Home Improvement, which provides services including DIY, tiling and plastering in the Darlington area. Her handywoman business is now in great demand.

Miss Jefferson said: 'It's mainly women who ring me up. They trust another woman to do the work and think that a woman can do a better job than a man because they take more care.

'They also feel safe leaving me to work in their homes if they need to pop out.'

The National Inspection Council for Electrical Installation Contracting (NICEIC), the voluntary regulatory body for the electrical contracting industry, launched a Jobs for the Girls campaign in January 2011 aimed at encouraging more women into the industry.

A spokesman said: 'There definitely seems to be more interest since we started the campaign. A lot more people say they are taking on women - they've got a woman employee or have taken on a female apprentice.

'That certainly wasn't there a year or so ago.'
