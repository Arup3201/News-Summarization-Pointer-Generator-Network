They are the pride and joy of millions of gardeners.

But Britain’s carefully kept lawns are under threat this summer – from hidden invaders beneath the soil.

Experts say leatherjackets, small larvae which eat the roots of grass, are at their highest levels for 40 years.

As they attack from below the grass is killed off, turning it brown.

The wet and mild winter provided perfect conditions for the grubs to thrive, with an estimated 250 for every square yard of turf in the worst-hit areas.

As spring progresses the grubs are growing larger and lawns sheltering the pests will gradually develop yellow patches that turn brown. When fully grown in August, the grubs will pupate and emerge as crane flies – also known as daddy-long-legs.

Leatherjackets threaten farmers’ cereal and grass crops and sports clubs have also been hit.

A cricket club in Surrey had to spend £6,000 replacing its outfield after it was eaten by the grubs.

Professor Davy McCracken, of Scotland’s Rural College, warned there may be a plague of daddy-long-legs in August.

‘Because of the densities we have seen, we would expect to see large numbers of daddy-long-legs on the wing, coming to lights at night, being in people’s homes, being around in the agricultural land.’

He told BBC Radio 4’s Farming Today that the infestation would be a severe challenge to farmers in the wettest parts of the country, particularly along the west coast of England and in Scotland, adding: ‘If you have one million grubs per hectare it is enough to decimate your crop.’

A pesticide previously used to kill the bugs was banned because of its harmful impact on bees.

An alternative method is to put a black sheet of plastic on the lawn overnight. The leatherjackets will be clinging to the underside in the morning and can be picked off and disposed of.
