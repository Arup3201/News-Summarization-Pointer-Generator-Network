When Honey-Rae Phillips was born with a giant strawberry birthmark, her mother and father wanted to show she was just like everyone else.

But their act of devotion has gone beyond even the most caring parents' wildest dreams.

Tanya and Adam Phillips each adorned their legs with mammoth tattoos, mimicking perfectly the blemishes which run up the right side of their 18-month-old daughter's body. 

Devotion: Honey-Rae Phillips (centre) was born with a harmless but disfiguring strawberry birthmark - so to show she is just like everyone else, her parents have each had tattoos of the same blotches (left and right)

Supportive: Father Adam Phillips and his wife Tanya constantly tell Honey-Rae (left) that she is beautiful

The proud couple, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, were in tears when they first saw Honey-Rae after she was born in 2013.

Although her strawberry birthmark is completely harmless, they were afraid the skin blotches - which affect one in ten children - could harm Honey-Rae's self-confidence when she grew up.

When her daughter was barely a year old, Mrs Phillips was horrified to discover pensioners pointing at her and whispering next to a shop till.

So for Christmas she paid for the two-and-a-half-hour, £80 procedure on her husband's leg - with plasterer Mr Phillips repaying the favour ahead of her 40th birthday this week.

Mrs Phillips said: ‘Most people might think it’s very extreme but to us it was the natural thing to do to ensure our daughter never felt different or alone in the world.’

Recounting the moment she first saw her daughter's birthmark, the proud mother said ‘She struggled to breathe when she was first born and was rushed to the special care unit. When I went to see her she was just lying in a little incubator and that’s when I saw it.

'It broke my heart. I just sobbed and sobbed knowing my baby was going to permanently marked for the rest of her life.

‘Like any mum I didn’t want her to be different. I wanted her to be exactly the same as every other healthy child. And as much as the birthmark isn’t dangerous, I knew it could have a huge impact on the rest of her life.

‘Although in our eyes she was perfect, I knew other people would cruelly point and stare at her. For the first few months of her life, whenever we went out, I made sure her legs were covered up. I couldn’t cope with stranger’s curious glances or whispering comments.’

‘I didn’t want sympathy or pity or people feeling sorry for Honey-Rae. Adam and I decided straight away that we wanted Honey-Rae to feel special, that her birthmark was something to feel proud of and not embarrassed by.

'From the moment she was born, we told Honey-Rae she was beautiful and constantly covered her in kisses.'

But when she noticed an elderly couple 'whispering and staring' at her daughter, Mrs Phillips was 'distraught' and decided she had to take action.

'It was the first time I had taken her out without covering her up and it confirmed all my worries and fears,' she said. 'People are cruel without even realising. And I knew if adults could be that insensitive, then kids at school would also be unintentionally mean.

‘We had talked about having duplicate tattoos done for a little while but that day my mind was made up. We knew we had to do something to ensure Honey-Rae grew up knowing she was very much loved.’

She added: ‘It was incredibly painful, especially as I had a flower to cover some old star tattoos, but it was worth every second of the pain.

‘When the swelling went down, I showed Honey-Rae, and she gently touched it and smiled as she said “Match”, pointing to her own leg.

‘If I’d have needed any reassurance that I’d made the right decision that was it.

‘She now constantly touches mine and Adam’s tattoos then her own birthmark and giggles - I couldn’t be happier.

‘Some people will says it odd and think what we’ve done is quite extreme, but in our eyes all we have done is ensure Honey-Rae never feels different. Mummy and Daddy now have the same permanent markings as she does.’

Condition: Known medically as haemangiomas, strawberry birthmarks are an abnormal cluster of blood vessels just under the skin. They affect one in ten babies but most of the time they are completely harmless

The couple already had tattoos on their legs, but none as extreme as the imitation birthmarks.

Known medically as haemangiomas, strawberry birthmarks are an abnormal cluster of blood vessels just under the skin which can vary hugely in size.

They get their name from their appearance, which can mimic the pattern and colouring of the summer fruit.

Most are harmless and do not need to be treated, with some types fading over time while others stay on the skin permanently.

Occasionally birthmarks need to be treated if they develop into ulcers or block the airways, but other people have them removed for cosmetic reasons.

Many can be removed with medicines, while others require laser treatment or even plastic surgery, according to the NHS.
