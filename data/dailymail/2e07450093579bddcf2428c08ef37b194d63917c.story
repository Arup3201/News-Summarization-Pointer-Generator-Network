Just as Paula Deen is attempting to rebuild her sullied reputation in the wake of last year’s N-word scandal, son Jamie has re-ignited the accusations of racism that surround the family.

Amid reports that the Food Network has cancelled his own cooking show, Jamie posted a photo on Twitter on Friday of him smooching with an older African-American woman.

The image was captioned ‘Don’t tell [my wife] Brooke. #jellyroll #sugar’.

Amid reports that the Food Network has cancelled his own cooking show, Jamie posted this photo on Twitter on Friday of him smooching with Ineata 'Jellyroll' Jones

The woman in the photo, Ineata ‘Jellyroll’ Jones, is an employee of Paula Deen who was at the center of some of last year’s racist accusations.

In 2013, The Columbus Dispatch claimed, ‘Deen used Jones for restaurant theater. At 11 a.m., when the doors opened at [her restaurant] Lady & Sons, she stood in front and rang an iron dinner bell.’

Jones was also tasked with making hoecakes at an open kitchen station in view of customers, and according to the paper, ‘Deen wanted Jones to dress in an old-style Aunt Jemima outfit.’

While Deen denied the accusation, former employee and Jones’ cousin Dora Charles said, ‘Jellyroll didn’t want to hear that. She didn’t want to do that.’

Deen was accused of forcing Ineata 'Jellyroll' Jones, pictured, to dress up in Aunt Jemima-style costume and postcards of her ringing the dinner bell were sold in many of the Deen Souvenir Shops

Jones did however dress up in Aunt Jemima-style costume and postcards of her ringing the dinner bell were sold in many of the Deen Souvenir Shops.

She have never spoken out to criticize her boss, but others have taken offense at the ill-advised photo posted by Jamie Deen.

One Twitter user, LaVerne Mack wrote, ‘Wow, did Paula Deen really call one of her workers Jelly Roll? I find that more offensive than the N word.’

'Jelly Roll' is most perhaps most commonly associated with the jazz musician Jelly Roll Morton, although it is also slang for a black woman’s genitalia.

Jamie’s questionable tweet comes amid a report from the New York Post that his Food Network show, Home For Dinner with Jamie Deen, will not been renewed for a third season.

Jamie's questionable tweet comes amid reports that his Food Network show, Home For Dinner with Jamie Deen, will not been renewed for a third season

Paula’s second son, Bobby Deen, hosts 
'Not My Mama’s Meals' on the Cooking Channel. He also is working on a 
new show concept for the channel, a spokeswoman said.

Last June, the Food Network cancelled Paula’s two shows due to low ratings soon after it was learned that she used the N word at her Savannah, Ga., restaurant.

Paula announced on June 11 that she was returning to TV via a namesake streaming network that will launch later this year and feature her own show along with content featuring her son. She plans to charge viewers about $10 a month.

‘You can throw out your TV, now,’ gushed the fallen Food Network star.

The network will feature daily programming in an unscripted format with new recipes, episodes and cooking tools.

‘We're going to have so much fun being together and cooking up some wonderful new and classic dishes,’ Deen said.

‘Y'all can get my recipes, tips and cooking anytime you want — this is for you. I can't wait to crank up the oven and get cooking for the people I love: my family, my friends and my fans!’

The announcement of the digital network is the latest step in a comeback strategy Deen kicked off in February when she announced a deal with the Najafi Companies, an Arizona-based private investment firm that's putting millions into rebooting her public career.

Earlier this month the 67-year-old gave a sneak peek of her upcoming 20-city comeback speaking tour with an appearance at the opening of her Gatlinburg, Tennessee retail Paula Deen Store.

Fans were disappointed from the start, though. Deen made them wait hours outside for her to arrive and open the place.

'We're going to have so much fun being together and cooking up some wonderful new and classic dishes,' Deen said. 'Y'all can get my recipes, tips and cooking anytime you want - this is for you'
