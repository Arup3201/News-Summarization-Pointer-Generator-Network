Hunched over a crystal ashtray, this is North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un pictured for the first time aboard his 174ft private  jet.

The Soviet Ilyushin IL-62, dubbed Air Force Un, follows a design which became the world's largest jet airliner when it first flew in 1963 but now sells for as little as £65,000.

Instead of 200 passengers it carries just the autocrat and his  trusted aides in a style compared in scale to the U.S. Presidential jet Air Force One.

Plane: Hunched over a crystal ashtray, this is  Kim Jong-Un pictured for the first time aboard the private  jet dubbed Air Force Un. A fully-equipped Soviet Ilyushin IL-62 would be capable of seating 200 people

Enjoying the view: The leader was on a tightly-controlled flight to view blocks of university apartments

Released by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, these photos showed the dictator examining half-built apartment blocks  on the eve of the anniversary of his father's birth.

He later toured the 'Future Scientists Street' on foot, using a pointing stick handed to him by a military underling so he could touch parts of the artist's impression he couldn't reach.

The use of a private jet is a departure from the behaviour of Kim's father Kim Jong-Il, who had such a fear of flying that he visited China and Russia in a private armoured train.

Unveiled in 1962 with its first flight the following year, the IL-62 became commonly-used around the world and continued being manufactured until 1994.

Now-defunct nations including the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia adapted the plane into a private jet before the fall of the Berlin Wall.

Visit: These images of the plane were revealed yesterday by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, and claim to show new apartments being built on the banks of Pyongyang's wide Taedong River

Comparison: Given its size and the insignia on its tail, the  jet has been compared to Air Force One

The ageing model continued to be used widely including by the Russian airline Aeroflot until 2008, when its prominence began to fade as the carrier struggled in the global recession.

Now second-hand versions can be bought for a fraction of the price of a London garage because of the airliner's age and high running costs.

One 1990-built IL-62 with its original long-haul seating arrangement is being sold for $100,000 (£65,000) by a seller in Tucson, Arizona.

Others are more expensive, including one 1984-built IL-62 which is on sale for $1million (£650,000) in Kazakhstan. 

The existence of Kim Jong-Un's private plane emerged last May, when state officials released photos of him disembarking onto a gigantic red carpet with his wife Ri Sol-ju.

Tour: The images were released a day before state officials marked the anniversary of Kim Jong-Il's birth

The North Korean ruler was accused of hypocrisy considering his contempt for Western indulgence, and U.S. President Barack Obama.

His nation is also accused by campaigners, charities and global governments of grievous human rights abuses.

It was even claimed that the leader enjoys trying his hand at the controls of the plane, though it is not known if he has qualifications as a pilot.

'Kim Jong-un likes steering aircraft,' a senior government source in Seoul was quoted as saying in the South's capital, Seoul. 

The new images were released yesterday ahead of the anniversary of Kim Jong-Il's birth on February 16, 1941.

Paying his respects: The autocrat at a memorial event today flanked by  top brass at Kumsusan Palace

The country marked the occasion with massive fireworks, the promotion of top generals and a rally by top officials to vow loyalty to his son Kim Jong-Un.

Flanked by military top brass, the ruler paid respects to his late father today in a mass ceremony at Pyongyang's Kumsusan Palace.

According to KCNA, the skyscrapers he viewed on the banks of Pyongyang's Taedong River will be lived in by scientists at the Kim Chaek University of Technology.

Run nearby in the secretive nation's capital, the university is named after a North Korean general who fought Japanese occupation alongside Kim's grandfather Kim Il-Sung.

The original Kim took power in 1948 and led the country for almost 50 years, creating a personality cult which means he is still North Korea's 'eternal president' despite dying in 1994.

His son Kim Jong-Il ruled from 1994 until his death in 2011 when he handed the reins to Kim Jong-Un, whose aggressive stance set off new diplomatic ripples between North Korea and the West. 

Red carpet treatment: These images released last May drew the attention of the world to Kim's private jet

Scale: The secretive nation has long since built up a cult of personality around the Kim dynasty

Even bigger: The U.S. President's Air Force One has two galley kitchens, a surgeon and an operating theatre
