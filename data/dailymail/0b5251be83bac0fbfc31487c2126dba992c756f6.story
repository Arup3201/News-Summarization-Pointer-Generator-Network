Dundee United chairman Stephen Thompson last night hailed Ryan Gauld's stunning move to Sporting Lisbon - in a deal that could eventually net the Tannadice club £12million.

Thompson helped pull off the £3m deal that has seen his teenage midfielder swap Tayside for the Portuguese capital on a six-year deal.

Such is Sporting's faith in the 18-year-old Scot, they insisted on inserting a clause in Gauld's contract stating that interested parties must fork out a staggering £48m to land the Scotland Under-21 player in future.

And Sportsmail believes that should Gauld one day meet that valuation, United would be in line to quadruple their initial £3m windfall from the Champions League outfit thanks to their own insertion of a sell-on percentage and add-ons amid what is  understood to be a complex deal.

Tannadice chairman Thompson said the move should encourage United's other coveted kids to aim for the very top - on the day the club rejected bids in excess of £1m from West Ham United for highly-rated Scotland left-back Andrew Robertson.

'It's never easy to let one of your best players go but it was a fantastic deal for the club and a fantastic opportunity for Ryan,' said Thompson.

'Let's just say we are happy with the contract and that if he moves on  further down the line then we will get benefits from that as well.

'I think this deal puts United on the map.

'How many times do you see a young home-grown  Scottish player get a transfer like this? Not very often.

'It's big news over in Portugal and in England.

'In terms of marketing ourselves as a place where talent is developed and then sold on, this deal is very good for the club.

'It is also very good for the other young players here. They couldn't get any better encouragement. 

'If Ryan can do it, they'll want to.' 

Thompson, who refused to speak about West Ham's interest in  Robertson, maintains the deal to sell Gauld was simply too good for the club to turn down. And he warned other sides watching Robertson, John Souttar, Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven, that his gifted kids won't be allowed to leave on the cheap.

Thompson said: 'A lot of work has been put in to developing the likes of Ryan and getting him and others on long-term contracts so we can get a decent transfer fee like this one. It's about the business side of things as much as the  football side.'

Gauld's money-spinning transfer will slightly strengthen boss Jackie McNamara's arm when it comes to bringing more new faces to the club this summer. 

Thompson said: 'The Gauld money doesn't change Jackie's budget dramatically. 

'We were backing him in the transfer market before, and we'll still be backing him.'
