Nicky Butt has been offered an interim role as head of coaching with Manchester United's academy.

The 40-year-old former Old Trafford favourite has been helping Warren Joyce with United's under 21's but has been keen to take on more coaching responsibility.

Butt was considered by Hull manager Steve Bruce before he took Mike Phelan as his assistant and United are keen to keep the former England midfielder as part of their set-up where he can have an influence on the younger players coming through.

United academy director Brian McClair is due to join the Scotland FA as performance director in the summer. Although he is continuing to work at United, the club want to prepare for his departure and see it as an opportunity to give Butt more coaching work.

United have yet to find a replacement for McClair. Arsenal's head of academy Andries Joncker has emerged as one of the possible contenders.

Butt was in attendance at Old Trafford on Tuesday to watch United's under 21's league clash with Tottenham - where Rafael and Falcao started in a 1-1 draw.
