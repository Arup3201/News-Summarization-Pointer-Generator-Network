A newborn baby was today found abandoned in a carrier bag which was left in a park.

Police in Birmingham have launched an urgent search for the mother of the little girl amid fears she may be in trouble.

The baby was found just after 2pm, wrapped in a light blue blanket inside a plastic shopping bag in a community park in the Stechford area of the city.

After she was discovered by a dog-walker she was taken to hospital, where she is being assessed by doctors.

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said that the child is believed to be in a stable condition.

Chief Inspector Jack Hadley appealed for the baby's mother to come forward immediately.

He said: 'Now that we know the baby is safe and in the care of professionals, our priority is to find mum.

'She may be in need of urgent medical attention and we need her to contact us as soon as possible.'

Investigation: Police are now urgently appealing for the child's mother to come forward

A West Midlands Ambulance spokesman said: 'We can confirm we went to an incident in a park in Stechford this afternoon.

'A baby girl was treated by ambulance staff and taken to a local hospital for assessment and treatment.'

Anyone with information is urged to call West Midlands Police on 101 as soon as possible.

The incident is strikingly similar to the case of a baby boy found abandoned inside a shopping bag on a doorstep in Worcester in July this year.

The newborn, nicknamed Joseph by the nurses who treated him, was left outside the home of a professional child-minder.

In August a woman, believed to be the child's mother, and a man were arrested and bailed on suspicion of child neglect.
