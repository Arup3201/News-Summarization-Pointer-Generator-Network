A couple cancelled their wedding reception after the bride-to-be was told to breastfeed their 13-week-old baby in a disabled toilet because it was 'not appropriate' in the restaurant.

Emily Ellis, 26, was left in tears when a female receptionist at the Cumberland Hotel in Bournemouth told her she could not feed her young son Presley in the public area.

She visited the three-star hotel last Monday with her fiancé Dan Smith to pay the £1,000 balance on their £2,500 wedding package, but they were forced to wait  for some time.

'We were there for ages and I needed to feed Presley. I asked if I could I go into the restaurant to feed my baby and the receptionist said it would not be appropriate in a public area,' said Miss Ellis.

The healthcare assistant, who has two other young children, was then invited to use a disabled toilet, leaving her 'shocked' and 'upset'.

'I said 'excuse me?' because I thought I must have misheard her but then she repeated it again. 

'I was shocked that it came from a woman. I was upset by it. When we were on our way home I had a cry,' she said.

The couple were so upset they walked out and Mr Smith, a nurse, called later to cancel their wedding reception which was due to be held on July 1. 

When he complained to the seafront hotel he was told the  receptionist was new.

The couple decided to cancel their booking at the hotel and are now frantically searching for a new venue as they are hoping to keep the same date.

'We sat down and spoke about it but I didn't think that was a good enough excuse. We cancelled the booking and are now frantically searching for another venue,' said Miss Ellis.

'They apologised but said it was because the receptionist was a trainee. I didn't really think that was a suitable excuse, what are they training their staff?

When the couple's 13-week-old son Presley started getting restless, Miss Ellis, a healthcare assistant, asked the receptionist if she could feed him in the restaurant

'It's not a training error, it's a human error. They wouldn't expect anyone else to eat their dinner in the toilet.' 

The couple had already sent out invitations to 45 guests for their summer wedding at the hotel when the incident occurred.

They have received a full refund, but are concerned that they made have to pay extra for a last-minute booking. 

The Cumberland Hotel in Dorset said its staff were 'devastated' by the 'misunderstanding'.

Pat Green, group operations manager at the hotel, insisted mothers are welcome to breastfeed in any of the public areas of the hotel.

She said: 'We have always supported breastfeeding mothers in all public areas. We also try to provide a private facility when requested.

'The incident occurred when a new member of staff was asked by the customer if there was anywhere she could breastfeed her baby.

'Miss Ellis was at leisure to breastfeed in any of our public areas.

'It was wrongly assumed by the junior reception agent that by Miss Ellis posing the question, a private space was being sought as all public areas were in use.

'For this reason, she referred the guest to our disabled restroom, which contains a comfortable armchair for breastfeeding, and baby changing facilities. She also went to check whether there was anywhere else available for the guest to breastfeed in private.

'The hotel staff are devastated that this misunderstanding has caused so much upset and we acknowledge that this was a result of poor communication on our part.

'The agent is extremely upset and sorry and sincerely meant no offence to Miss Ellis and her partner.

'We have offered the guest a sincere apology along with a significant goodwill gesture, which the customer has declined.'

She added that all staff will receive training to ensure it does not happen again.

The hotel has offered the couple a complimentary two night stay with spa treatments and a three-course meal which they have turned down.

Justine Roberts, Mumsnet CEO, said: 'It's bemusing that some people have a problem with breastfeeding. 

'It is after all a natural, essential human process - babies need to be fed when they're hungry and women shouldn't be made to hide themselves away in toilets to fulfil that need.' 

Mother Lou Burns, 35, was asked to cover herself as she breastfed her baby in Claridge's hotel in December last year.

She was left humiliated after staff at the five-star Mayfair hotel gave her a giant napkin to cover up as she fed her 12-week-old daughter Isadora during afternoon tea.

Mrs Burns, who is married to comedy actor Nick Burns, was reportedly told by staff to use the napkin to avoid 'causing offence', but said she was left humiliated and burst into tears afterwards. 

At the time, she said: 'I was really shocked as I had never experienced this before. Through my tears I tried to explain that I was really quite cross.' 

Dozens of women braved freezing conditions to protest against the hotel's policy in a demonstration organised by Free to Feed - which campaigns for the 'normalising' of public breastfeeding.

Classical musician Kathrine Jenkinson was banned from taking her 11 month old baby into the exclusive Oriental Club in central London, because no under 12s were allowed in.

She had hoped a babysitter could look after the child in her dressing room while she played Haydn's Piano Trio in G major at the exclusive Club.

Instead, the babysitter had to wait outside the venue in December last year, with Olivia Grace and Miss Jenkinson, 34,  had to leave the building during the interval to feed her baby.

Meanwhile in August Natasha Barnett, 29, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was told by a lifeguard at Middleton Pool that she could not breastfeed her five-month-old daughter Olive because it was 'classed as eating and drinking'. 

In June 2014, a mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant. 

Carrie Davies, 27, was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son Trystan.

Ms Davies, who was lunching with a friend, was offered a spot by the restaurant's toilets, which bosses at the restaurant say was more 'convenient' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there. 

Around 70 women descended on Sports Direct in Nottingham city centre in April last year to show support for 25-year-old Wioletta Komar, who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three-month-old son.

She claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of 'company policy'.

The sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to McDonald's which had a baby and mother room. 

According to the Equality Act of 2010, it is discriminatory to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding.
