A schoolboy in China bled to death when a fake doctor cut his throat with a scalpel to treat his sore tonsils.

Xiu Tsao, 35, had taken her 11-year-old son Yang Chin to a clinic in Chaochuan Village, Xiaotun Town, Henan Province, unaware that it was operated by fraudsters.

It was run by Zhang Wenli, 46, who claimed to be a top throat specialist, but in fact he had no qualifications at all. His nurses were also completely unqualified.

The mother said that the boy had been performing really well at school and when he had been taken ill with a sore throat, she had heard the clinic could get him back to school quicker than if she took him to the hospital.

She said she had taken him inside and the doctor had announced that the inside of his throat was a bit raw, and he needed to bleed away some of the bad blood to cure the problem.

'He used a scalpel and I noticed that blood was coming out of my son's mouth,' Central European News quoted her as saying. 

'He told me it was perfectly normal but he stopped the bleeding process then.

'He had already made several incisions by that point. But my son was still in difficulty and I could see him kicking his legs while the doctor held onto him.'

Unsuspecting: The clinic in Chaochuan Village, Henan Province, which the fake doctor had run for years

After three minutes, she said, the boy's legs had stopped moving. The doctor still insisted it was normal, but had by then called an ambulance.

Emergency medics could only confirm that the boy was dead, after which the doctor and his staff fled.

Police confirmed they were looking for them and also confirmed that the qualifications of the staff of the clinic which had been operating for years were completely fake.
