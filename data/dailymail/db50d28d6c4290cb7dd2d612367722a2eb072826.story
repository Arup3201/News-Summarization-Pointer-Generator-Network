Tom Ince has his pick of foreign clubs after Inter Milan emerged as clear favourites ahead of Benfica, Monaco and Olympiacos in what has turned into quite an international auction for the England Under 21 winger. None of which will be of much consolation to Blackpool, of course.

They stand to lose up to £8million if the player moves abroad, bringing to an end an increasingly bitter relationship between the Championship club and 22-year-old Ince, his father Paul – the former England captain and Blackpool manager – and their advisors.

Even though Ince’s contract at Bloomfield Road is about to run out, Blackpool would receive substantial compensation from a tribunal if he joins another English club because he is under 23.

Wanted man: Inter Milan are favoruites ahead of Benfica and Monaco to sign Tom Ince this summer

That scenario cannot be ruled out amid interest from Tottenham, Everton and Newcastle, but they are unlikely to want to pay £8m – the estimated figure based on the £1.5m fee Crystal Palace paid Blackpool to take Ince on loan for the second half of last season.

However, the compensation Blackpool receive will plummet to just £155,000 if Ince follows in his father Paul’s footsteps to the San Siro or joins another foreign club.

Ince’s situation was already complicated because Blackpool had agreed to pay Liverpool a 35 per cent cut of any sell-on fee for the player when they signed him from Anfield for £500,000 three years ago.

With chairman Karl Oyston determined to bank a net figure of £6m from any transfer, that pushed the club’s overall valuation of Ince above the £8m mark and scared off a number of suitors last summer, including Liverpool themselves.

Cardiff offered Blackpool £8.5m and Ince £35,000-a-week, but he turned down a move to South Wales to stay in the northwest with his newborn baby daughter.

Decision: Ince initially stayed with Blackpool after turning down Cardiff

The final twist came when a furious Ince snr was sacked as Blackpool manager by Oyston via text message in January. It followed reports that the club were unhappy Paul had allegedly taken time off to drive his son to hold talks with Monaco before attending a two-day coaching course at St George’s Park.

Tom did not play for the club again and joined Palace on loan shortly afterwards, scoring one goal in eight appearances.

So do Ince’s plans to move abroad now amount to payback? 

He and his father would claim with some justification that the chance to play for Inter Milan, where Paul and the his family spent two years in the mid-90s following a £7.5m move from Manchester United, or any of the other foreign options on the table is simply too good to turn down.

They flew into the city’s Linate Airport on Sunday night and were given a tour of the club’s facilities on Monday before discussing personal terms with Inter owner Erick Thohir and technical director Piero Ausilio.

‘This is an incredible story,’ said Paul. ‘It’s incredible that Tom is here at 22, and he was five back then. I spent a beautiful time here.

‘The important thing for Tom is to be 
here today, to see the training ground, get to know the stadium and the 
city. Then we will go back home and take a decision. I’m here now for my
 son. I think we will know more in a couple of weeks.’

Move abroad: Paul Ince joined Inter Milan in 1995 and spent two seasons playing for the Italian giants

Tom admitted he is tempted by playing at the San Siro where he watched his dad star alongside some of the biggest names in world football.

‘I’m not an Inter player yet but I’m very happy to be here two or three days in the meantime,’ he said.

‘Inter have a fantastic squad and Italy is a great country where I have many fond memories. They are one of the most important clubs in the world.’
