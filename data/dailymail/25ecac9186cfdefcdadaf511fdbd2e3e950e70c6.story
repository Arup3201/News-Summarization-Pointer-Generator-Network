Kim Jong Un was photographed being mobbed by an adoring crowd just days after the FBI confirmed North Korea's spies were responsible for hacking Sony Pictures Entertainment.

The dictator was surrounded by hordes of delirious citizens while visiting a textile mill in the capital city of Pyongyang to offer his guidance.

The outing came as his country proposed a joint investigation with the US into the hacking attack - warning of 'serious consequences' if Washington denies North Korea the chance to clear its name.

Kim's latest outing: The dictator was surrounded by hordes of delirious citizens while visiting a textile mill in the capital city of Pyongyang

Kim barely had room to move during his visit as the crowd, many appearing to cry with joy, mobbed their leader while raising their hands in salute.

This week the US vowed to respond to the cyber crime - which the FBI pinned on North Korea - claiming the attack was 'intended to inflict significant harm' on American citizens.

The hack resulted in the disclosure of tens of thousands of leaked emails and other materials and escalated to '9/11-style' terrorist threats against US cinemas that prompted Sony to cancel the Christmas release of the movie The Interview.

The comedy, written by and starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, is about a CIA plot to assassinate Kim Jong Un. 

Statement: Today North Korea proposed a joint probe with the US into the hack - warning of 'serious consequences' if the offer is rejected

Dig at the CIA: A Foreign Ministry spokesman in Pyongyang said North Korea can prove its innocence 'without resorting to torture'

Today, an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman in Pyongyang said North Korea knows how to prove its innocence and insisted the US must accept its proposal for the joint investigation.

They said: 'The U.S. should bear in mind that it will face serious consequences in case it rejects our proposal for joint investigation and presses for what it called countermeasures while finding fault with North Korea.

'We have a way to prove that we have nothing to do with the case without resorting to torture, as what the CIA does.'

Yesterday Barack Obama said Sony made a crucial mistake in cancelling the Christmas Day release of The Interview.

Speaking in a press conference, he said: 'Sony's a corporation. It has suffered significant damage. There were threats against its employees. I am sympathetic to the concerns that they faced.'

'Having said all that, yes, I think they made a mistake. I wish they had spoken to me first. I would have told then, "Do not get into a pattern in which you're intimidated by these kinds of criminal attacks".'

Fear of reprisal: George Clooney said Hollywood bigwigs 'know what they have written in emails' and are 'afraid' to support The Interview

Sony claimed it had had no choice but to cancel distribution of the movie since cinemas were refusing to show it. 

Hollywood star George Clooney recently weighed into the argument by circulating a petition supporting the film.

The actor said he believed fellow celebrities and industry figures were afraid to sign it in case they were also targeted by hackers.

Speaking to Hollywood showbiz magazine, Clooney described the tactic as 'brilliant', because the hackers humiliated Sony, which subsequently prevented anyone from standing up to defend them.

He said: 'After the Obama joke, no one was going to get on the side of Amy, [Amy Pascal, Sony Pictures co-chair] and so suddenly, everyone ran for the hills. 

'Look, I can't make an excuse for that joke, it is what it is, a terrible mistake. Having said that, it was used as a weapon of fear, not only for everyone to disassociate themselves from Amy but also to feel the fear themselves. 

'They know what they themselves have written in their emails, and they're afraid.'
