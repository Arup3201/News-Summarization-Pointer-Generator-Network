A self described tomboy and mixed martial arts fighter has proved she’s got beauty as well as brawn,  after reaching the finals of the Miss England beauty pageant.

Nikki Sahota, 24, spends her days donning martial arts gloves and taking down male opponents twice her size in metal cages and even appeared alongside Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez as a kickboxing beauty in the Hollywood blockbuster Fast And The Furious 6.

But this weekend, the West Bromwich fighter will replace the Octagon with the catwalk as she challenges for the Miss England crown in a glamorous dress and high-heels.

Talented: Mixed martial arts specialist, Nikki Sahota, 24, has made it to the finals of this year's Miss England

Beauty: Despite her passion for martial arts, Nikki has already taken one beauty title - Miss Black Country 2012

The former Territorial Army officer beat off hundreds of finalists to become Miss Black Country in January this year, discovering that she had won while sparring in the gym.

As well as winning the the Miss England 2013 crown 5ft 7in Nikki says she is also hoping to become part of the Team GB kickboxing team at the Rio Olympics in 2016.

The Staffordshire University student is currently enjoying a gap year before starting the second year of a psychology degree.

Since taking up mixed martial arts 
Nikki has gained sponsorship from Bad Boy MMA, one of the sport’s 
leading clothing that sponsors UFC fighters. 

But despite running the risk of a black eye, size six Nikki revealed that taking up the UFC combat sport has helped develop her strength of character she needs to compete in the Miss England competition.

Nikki said: 'Since I was really little I’ve always been a tomboy. I did boxing on and off at school and then last August I just wanted to see how far I could push myself so took up MMA [Mixed Martial Arts].

'Now it’s like there’s two different personas. On one hand a girl with glamorous dresses and a crown and heels, but on the other hand, when I’m in my MMA gear I’m tough and empowered.

Glamour: Despite taking on men in martial arts, Nikki says Miss England brings out her feminine side

'It’s that transformation as soon as I put that gear on I feel so strong, this is me, the athlete.'

And Nikki has needed her battling spirit, after being struck down by septicaemia and kidney infections weeks after winning the Miss Black Country prize in 2012.

The illness meant Nikki, who is also the current Miss Asian Model, had to pull out of last year’s Miss England competition a few days before the final.

But she has since fully recovered and says she is looking forward to competing in this year’s final at the Riviera International conference centre in Torquay between June 13 and 16.

Nikki added: 'It’s exactly a year ago since I fell ill, but now feels like another life. I feel like I was in a glass snow-globe being shaken around, but I can see things clearly now. It feels like those things were happening to a different person.

'It’s mentally challenging when you get ill, you don’t look or feel great, you can’t do things and it is really tough. I would really love to win this year.

'Last year I said I was doing it because I wanted to be a role model, but this year I really believe I can be the new Miss England. 

Film star: Nikki appeared in the Fast and Furious film franchise as a glamorous female kick boxer

Sporty: Nikki, from West Bromwich, has a passion for all things equine but prefers mixed martial arts

'I don’t think I’m the most beautiful girl or the most talented, but everything I do I put my heart and soul into.

'I feel like I’m already a winner because I’ve picked myself up from anything I’ve been through and started again.

'I want to inspire others to go and follow their dreams, especially when other people tell you that you can’t do things. 

'There’s a great healing power in vulnerability and when you’re real about who you are, it gives others the courage to do the same.'

A spokesperson for Miss England said:
'Nikki epitomises the type of strong young woman that we now attract to
the Miss England competition.

'We’re really proud of how she’s turned adversity around and used it as a positive to be a role model to other young girls.

'It proves that with hard work and dedication you can achieve anything you set your mind to.”

This weekend around 50 girls will 
battle for the crown, a place at the Miss World competition and prizes 
worth £30,000 including a luxury holiday to Mauritius.
