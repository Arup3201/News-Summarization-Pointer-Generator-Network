It's the ultimate case of 'worst house, best Street.'

Possibly the saddest-looking Victorian-era home in the most picturesque part of Sydney is expected to fetch at least $1.8 million when it goes under the hammer this month.

Belle Property agents have described the two-bedroom heritage-listed house in James Lane, Balmain East as a 'rare unpolished gem' for the 'astute and imaginative buyer.'

That's because, despite its overgrown weeds and peeling paint, the property sits on 452sq metres of absolute waterfront with panoramic views to the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

This James Lane waterfront home, expected to sell for almost $2 million, just needs a little TLC

Built in 1857, the property has been held by the same family for about 40 years but has been unoccupied for the last six months.

Although it has been left to crumble, the house's period features are intact, including high ceilings, stained-glass windows, a sandstone front porch and fireplace and tall wooden windows.

Balmain is considered one of the most sought after suburbs in Sydney's Inner West - but a home here won't come cheap. According to RP data, medium house prices in Balmain East have risen 21.8 per cent to $1.98 million in the last year.

A renovator's dream: a sooty sandstone fireplace is one of the remaining Victorian-era features of this Balmain home, left to rot for the last 6 months
