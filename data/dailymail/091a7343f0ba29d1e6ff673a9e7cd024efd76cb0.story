Watch this billboard very, very closely, for it might just blow you away.

The advertising hoarding on this Swedish subway platform looks like any you are likely to pass in any city across the world.

But wait until a train flies past and the model comes to life, her hair blowing wildly in the rush of wind.

What a rush: But wait until a train flies past and the model comes to life, her hair blowing wildly in the rush of wind

It is in fact a video monitor hooked up to a series of sensors, all rigged to react when a train enters Odenplans station in central Stockholm.

The ad is for the Apolosophy range of hair care products which its manufacturer, the Apotek pharmacy chain, says will 'make your hair come alive'.

An advert for the advert, posted on YouTube, shows startled commuters stopping in their tracks to watch the action unfold.

Others are compelled to take photos of it with their mobile phones so as not to forget the experience or to share it with their friends.

The production company Stopp Family, which created the ad, writes on its website: 'We needed to build a device that could be calibrated to sense the arrival of the train and not react to passing passengers.

'Using an ultra sonic sensor, connected to a Raspberry Pi and a local network socket, we connected our device to the screens computer where the film could be activated by the passing trains.'
