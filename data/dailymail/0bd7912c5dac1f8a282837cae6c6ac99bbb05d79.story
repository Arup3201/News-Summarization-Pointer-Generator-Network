A South African university has voted to pull down a statue of a notorious British colonialist after students threw a bucket of excrement at it.

Bosses at the University of Cape Town bowed to demands to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes after a series of protests on campus.  

UCT, the oldest university in South Africa and regularly ranked as the best on the continent, was built on land donated by Rhodes, a mining magnate who died in 1902.

Students and staff of the University of Cape Town stage a protest against the statue of Cecil Rhodes. Excrement was launched at the statue during one protest 

But the 'poo protest' was launched by a small group of students earlier this month, sparking a series of demonstrations demanding that the statue be torn down.

Many of the students involved in the protests never lived under the injustices of white minority rule, but say they still experience racial discrimination 21 years after the end of apartheid. 

The large statue of a notoriously racist Rhodes gazing across an Africa that he coveted for the British empire made them feel alienated on a campus still dominated by white staff, they said. 

On Friday, the university senate voted 181 to one to remove the statue permanently from the campus, after vice-chancellor Max Price acknowledged 'the many injustices of colonial conquest enacted under Rhodes' watch'. 

While the university council still has to endorse the move at a special meeting on April 8, the statue will be boarded up until it is handed over to government heritage authorities, university spokeswoman Pat Lucas said.

'It is certainly a victory for us,' said student representative council president Ramabina Mahapa.

'It means we are being heard by the larger community.'

Cecil Rhodes was born in Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire and went on to became one of Britain's most successful colonialists.

He was sent to southern Africa in the late nineteenth century when he suffered bad health as a teenager.

Within four decades he had established political control of Britain's Cape Colony, expanded the territory north to found Rhodesia and taken ownership of the world's richest diamond mining company De Beers. 

His expansionist plans were fired by a dream of securing a British corridor of power stretching from Cape Town to Cairo.

But his short life was blighted by bad health and he  died of heart failure aged just 49.

Following his death Rhodes' remains were transported by train from Cape Town to Bulawayo and laid to rest in the Matopo Hills south of the city, his favourite spot in the vast empire he had helped secure for Britain in southern Africa.

Rhodes, famous for dreaming of a Cape-to-Cairo railway, made his fortune with his De Beers mining company during the Kimberley diamond rush, and went on to grow his wealth during the ensuing gold rush around modern-day Johannesburg.

But the disappearance of Rhodes is unlikely to end the debate on racial transformation launched by the protest, which gave rise to similar demands for change at two other universities.

In the east coast city of Durban, students at the University of KwaZulu Natal splattered white paint and anti-racism slogans on a statue of Britain's King George V.

And at Rhodes University in the Eastern Cape, activists want the institution to be renamed.

The protests have also sparked debate among academics, historians, politicians and writers of letters to newspapers. 

Students have dismissed the argument that Rhodes should be honoured for donating land for the campus, saying he stole it from black Africans in the first place.

Eusebius McKaiser, an author and commentator who attended Rhodes University and won a prestigious international Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University, said in the New York Times: 'South African universities remain a testament to the country's colonial heritage in terms of what they teach, who does the teaching, and the morally odious symbols that haunt our campuses or lurk in their very names.

'At Rhodes, 83 per cent of senior management staff remain white and 77 per cent of "professionally qualified staff," a category that includes academic teaching staff, are white,' he said. 

Whites make up about eight percent of South Africa's population of some 54 million.

McKaiser, who is of mixed race, defended the fact that he accepted a Rhodes scholarship, telling a radio interviewer that in moral terms the colonialist's money belonged to 'the millions of black South Africans whose rights were trampled on'.

He took the scholarship to Oxford 'so that I could come back and show the middle finger to his legacy,' McKaiser said.

Since the end of apartheid the names of some cities and streets deemed offensive have been changed, but monuments to South Africa's racist white-minority rule remain scattered throughout the country.

Much of that can be attributed to the racial reconciliation policies of  Nelson Mandela, who became the country's first democratically-elected president in 1994.

Another former Rhodes scholar, Shaun Johnson, wrote in South Africa's Times newspaper of his surprise when Mandela agreed in 2002 to have his name coupled with that of Rhodes in a new charitable organisation.

The Mandela Rhodes Foundation, of which Johnson is now executive director, provides post-graduate scholarships to young Africans.

'Mandela told us to expect controversy and embrace it, while remaining certain in the knowledge that what we were actually doing was what mattered,' Johnson wrote.

'He said... whenever possible, we had to put history to work for a better future.'

Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa echoed Mandela's approach in his response to the UCT protests.

'The government's attitude and policy to all heritage sites - including statues of former imperialists like Cecil John Rhodes, among others - is based on a national policy of reconciliation, nation-building and social cohesion,' he said.
