A tiger who featured in TV 
adverts for petrol giant Esso has been saved from death by a British wildlife park after being mistreated by a circus.

Eighteen-year-old Tango had been earmarked for destruction in Belgium along with his partner Julia after the two tigers were seized from a German circus last year.

The pair were rescued following a campaign by Neil Mumby and his team of keepers at Woodside Wildlife and Falconry Park in Lincolnshire to save them.

Forlorn: It has taken more than six months and £250,000 to secure Julia and Tango (seen here before his rescue), but his new owners said it has been worth the expense

Tango was one of several tigers who starred in TV adverts for Esso - whose slogan was 'Put a tiger in your tank' - in the 1990s.

He later went to the circus in Germany, where he and Julia were mistreated.

The two tigers have arrived at their new home near Langworth, Lincolnshire.

Mr Mumby, director of the Woodside, said the pair arrived safely and went straight to bed after their long journey.

He said: 'They are doing really well. They've had a long journey and just like us humans, they get tired, so they went straight to bed when they got here.'

It has taken more than six months and £250,000 to secure the two tigers, but Mr Mumby said it had been worth the cost.

He said: 'There are no other tigers in
 Lincolnshire on view to the public. It's great for the people of 
Lincolnshire to be able to come and learn about them.

'Tango
 is one of the Esso tigers so he's a TV star who has come here to enjoy 
his retirement. He would have been one of many tigers to be used in the 
adverts.'

The Esso (Exxon) brand of petrol was advertised with the tiger slogan between the 1960s and 1990s.

Tango (not pictured) was one of several tigers to front ad campaigns like this one for Esso during the 1990s

Fuelling the marketing campaign: Esso also ran this series of magazine adverts in the 2000s

Mr Mumby said: 'After the ads, he went over to the circus in Germany where he is sadly believed to have been mistreated.

'Happily,
 he is here with us now and he will be able to enjoy his retirement with
 his partner Julia, who is only eight years old. She keeps him young.'

The park was contacted six months ago by animal charity Wildlife Re-homing services after it was alerted to the tigers' plight.

It had to grapple with cross-border bureaucratic wrangling, working with the animal import laws of three countries.

New home: The tiger enclosure at Woodside Wildlife and Falconry Park

The big cats' arrival was further delayed by industrial action by French staff at Calais, Mr Mumby said.

'The paperwork has been a nightmare,' he said. 'These tigers were supposed to be coming a few days ago.

'We've got the Belgian government, the French government and the British Government all involved.

'Trying to get all of the government departments to talk to each other can sometimes cause hiccups.'

The animals are now on display to the public at the park.

They were being held in the indoor section of a new enclosure built for the big cats for a day, before being allowed into the open-air section.

A spokesman for Esso told MailOnline: 'Tigers have not featured in our advertising in this country for many years, but back in the 1990s a number of different tigers appeared as cubs following two days filming and a one day photographic session.

'We were concerned to learn of their recent plight and are pleased to learn that they have been given a good home.'
