A visionary project has been approved which will see Australia’s largest solar farm constructed in Queensland in a staggering $1 billion project.

The impressive development promises to be 100 times bigger than the country’s current largest solar farm and potentially, the largest of its kind in the world.

The plant will be located on a 5,000 hectare acre site at Bulli Creek on Queensland’s Darling Downs and promises to produce enough clean power for 550,000 homes.

The south-west Queensland project is expected to begin construction in 2016.

It is hoped that within eight years the solar farm will be generating two gigawatts of power; a massive figure which is more power than any coal station in Queensland is currently capable of producing.

After seven years as a barrister, Angus Gemmell established Solar Choice, a solar project broker and consumer comparison service, which was the driving force behind the proposal

‘This will be a wonderful example of what Australia can make from our natural resources, space and sunshine,’ Angus Gemmell, managing director of Solar Choice, told Daily Mail Australia.

'Australia is wonderfully geared to some visionary projects to harness those benefits of cheaper, bountiful, reliable sources of power,” Mr Gemmell told the Guaridan.

Mr Gemmell was formerly one of Australia’s top defamation lawyers and won some of the country's most high-profile cases.

In 2006 he won a case which saw NRL player Mark McGaw awarded $385,000, which is the largest ever damages figure handed down by a judge, after a Today Tonight program accused McGaw of domestic violence.

Gemmell also represented political figures, including defence intelligence chief Frank Lewincamp.

After seven years in his profession Gemmell established Solar Choice, a solar project broker and consumer comparison service, which was the driving force behind the proposal.

With Gemmell at the helm, Solar Choice campaigned for 18 ‘exhaustive’ months until approval was finally granted three weeks ago.

The Toowoomba Regional Council referred to the Queensland State Government before the game-changing project was given the go-ahead.

The Bulli Creek Solar Farm will be built toward full 2GW capacity in ‘manageable steps’ over a number of years.

‘We have optionality reserved to build over time, up to eight years. This means we are able to break it down into manageable steps,’ Mr Gemmell told Daily Mail Australia.

Solar Choice have located one of a very few locations which meet all requirements.

‘It’s wonderfully positioned, close to major transmission nodes in the national electricity grid. It’s on large-scale, cleared flat country. All aspects make it for an aspiring study,’ Mr Gemmell told Daily Mail Australia.

The area is also ‘soaked in sunshine’ due to ‘good sun hours’ and has no neighbours.

There are no ecological restraints. 

Crucially, the Bulli Creek site is close to a 330 kilovolt substation near Millmerran, operated by Powerlink. This ensures the solar power will be able to reach Australians across the nation.

The next step will be for Solar Choice to work with Powerlink for six to nine months to determine how to connect the solar farm to the grid.

The project has already garnered the interest of a number of crucial investors.

‘Investors are well-advanced in the project. A number of North American and European-based parties are certainly very excited by the solar farm.

The interested parties already have experience with similar, very large-scale solar projects.

‘No one has finally signed up but they have completed due diligence on the project.’

The project has already garnered the interest of a number of crucial investors. However, investors require legislative certainty from the government regarding the renewable energy target before they come on board

However, investors require legislative certainty from the federal government regarding the renewable energy target before they come on board.

The Abbott government wants to redefine a renewable energy target (RET) set by a previous centre-left government in 2009.

The government promised that 20 percent of projected energy use would be renewable by 2020.

However, the current government wants to aim for 20 percent of actual energy use, which is far less.

To reach the target, the government subsidises companies which invest in renewable energy as well as households and small businesses which opt to use such energy.

Changing the current mandate could potentially deter investors. 

But the cost of renewable energy is higher than the subsidies, so companies pass on costs to customers.

The government and opposition are now negotiating new terms of the RET in a review that is expected to last a year.

‘We have placed this project on the radar at all levels of politics,’ Gemmell told Daily Mail Australia.

‘We are helping to show them that there are alternatives. There is conjecture at a federal level that there is not enough of a pipe line in Australia.

‘However this project would be considerable way to help achieve the target (20 per cent of projected energy use).

‘It is proof that there is enough of a pipeline in Australian to reach the target, not to fall short of it.’

The solar farm is forecast to take Australia 25 per cent closer to achieving the current target, 41,000 GWh. by 2020.
