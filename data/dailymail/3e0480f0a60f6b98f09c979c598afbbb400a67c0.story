Ottis Gibson will be England's interim fast-bowling coach, in place of David Saker, for next month's tour of his native West Indies.

Gibson was previously part of England's management team on a permanent basis in the same capacity between 2007 and early 2010, and subsequently West Indies coach until last year.

He will join up with England again when Alastair Cook's team flies to the Caribbean next week for three Tests.

The 46-year-old former West Indies seamer was the England Lions' fast-bowling coach on this year's tour of South Africa.

Australian Saker has informed the England and Wales Cricket Board he intends to leave his post in September, to become Melbourne Renegades coach in the Big Bash.

ECB managing director Paul Downton said: 'We are delighted to have secured a bowling coach of Ottis' calibre, as he is highly respected among the fast-bowling fraternity and his knowledge and experience of local conditions will be invaluable in the Caribbean.

'We must, however, stress that this is a short-term appointment at this stage.

'No decision has yet been made on a long-term replacement for David, and we will need to review how we staff this position going forward following the conclusion of the West Indies tour. '
