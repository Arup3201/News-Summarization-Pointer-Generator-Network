A grieving mother who questioned her faith following the death of her son says it has been restored after receiving a message from a Vatican representative offering condolences.

Stephany Nicolo, of Wakefield, Massachusetts, called the Vatican following the death of her 25-year-old son, Eric, in May, from an epileptic seizure.

Ms Nicolo, 58, told FoxNews she said she no longer believed in God and 'sobbed uncontrollably' as she left her name and number with a representative of the Vatican.

She awoke last week to find a missed call, along with a voicemail message on her phone from a man who identified himself as a Vatican representative.

The man can be heard to offer Ms Nicolo a 'big hug and a blessing' and says they will 'try to talk to you again.'

Ms Nicolo told FoxNews that Pope Francis 'has helped me so much in my time of grief.'

She said: 'There are no words to describe what this phone call has done for me.'

Meanwhile, in an unrelated announcement, the Vatican has given its blessing to exorcisms as a standard practise in the Catholic Church.

More than forty years after 1973 film The Exorcist terrified cinema audiences the world over, the Church has recognised, under canon law, the work of a group of priests who claim to banish demons from the possessed.

Exorcists consists of 250 priests in 30 countries who perform religious 
ceremonies to 'liberate the faithful from demons.'

Last year he appeared to cast out a demon from a wheelchair-bound man who said he was possessed by the devil.

The Vatican insisted the pope 'didn't intend to perform any exorcism,' and it released a statement that said 'he simply intended to pray for someone who was suffering who was presented to him.'

The man later said that Francis had failed to banish the demons from his body. However, after Francis placed his hands on him, he was able to walk again, he claimed.

The association was introduced in Italy by veteran exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth, to share experience as increased interest in occult practices has boosted demand for exorcisms.

Fr. Francesco Bamonte, an exorcist from the Diocese of Rome told official Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano that the Holy See’s approval of the IAE 'is cause for joy... for the church as a whole.'

'Exorcism is' in fact 'another form of charity' he said.
