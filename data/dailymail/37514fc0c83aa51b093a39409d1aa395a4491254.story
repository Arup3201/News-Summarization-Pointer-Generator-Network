Georgios Samaras is expected to arrive at West Bromwich Albion on Thursday as talks about signing for the club on a free transfer edge closer to completion.

The Greece international striker has been identified as a player who could operate as a centre forward or in wide areas. His two-footed ability is also seen as a plus.

Samaras, 29, is without a club after Celtic failed to offer him new terms at the end of his Parkhead contract. He has attracted interest from Sampdoria, Sevilla and Hamburg and recently had discussions with Malaga.

But it is believed West Brom appeals to the former Manchester City striker as he only needs to move his family south of the border.

A deal could be completed by the end of the week but Samaras would not feature against Southampton on Saturday as he needs to improve his fitness following a summer without pre-season.

He was on duty for Greece at the World Cup in Brazil and scored a last-minute winning penalty against Ivory Coast to dramatically secure his nation’s place in the knock-out phase.

Standing at 6ft 4in he brings a physical presence and Champions League experience with Celtic, where he scored 74 goals in 248 games in all competitions. 

Samaras got eight goals in 54 games during his previous spell in the Premier League with City between 2005 and 2008. He has 78 Greece caps and nine goals.

West Brom are also on the lookout for one or two more wingers, with West Ham’s Matt Jarvis and Atletico Madrid’s Christian Rodriguez linked. Both deals would not be without their difficulties however and the search is ongoing.
