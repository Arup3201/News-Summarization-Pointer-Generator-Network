A manhunt is underway for a female football spectator after she smuggled fireworks 'inside her body' into a stadium before throwing them at a goalkeeper.

The Zenit St Petersburg fan is believed to have put the fireworks in condoms before pushing them in her body and entering the arena in Moscow.

It is now feared that Dynamo Moscow keeper, Anton Shunin, may partially lose his eyesight following the attack.

Dozens of the contraceptives were found in the women's toilets at the match on Saturday.

Fan throws fireworks: Goalkeeper Anton Shunin writhes in pain after a fan threw a firework at him at the match in Moscow on Saturday

The game was stopped in the 36th minute and 92 people, including three women, were arrested but the perpetrator is yet to be found.

A Russian police officer said that contraceptives such as condoms were used to smuggle flares into the stadium by pushing them into the vagina or anus.

An police source was quoted by 
Interfax saying: ‘During the inspection of the stadium after Dynamo’s 
match against Zenit, at which one of the female fans of the St. 
Petersburg team threw a firecracker on the pitch, injuring the Dynamo 
goalkeeper, the police found dozens of condoms in the ladies' room.’

The inspection of female fans is believed to be not as strict or thorough compared to men at Russian stadiums.

Footage
 of the match showed Shunin jump after being suddenly surrounded by 
smoke before falling to the ground and writhing in pain.

Shunin required treatment to his eyes after suffering a chemical burn and injuries to his ear when the firecracker blew up.

Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was left to rue 'not an incident but a crime and furthermore a premeditated crime'. 

He said: 'There cannot be anarchy. People need to be put in prison for this sort of thing.'

Medvedev said it should be a priority to adopt new legislation aimed at preventing such violence from taking place. 

A
 representative for Zenit fans was quoted by Sovetsky Sport newspaper 
saying: ‘What happened in Khimki wasn’t a planned action, but a stupid 
act of some individuals.

'If
 they are detained, we’ll deal with them inside the fan community, 
because the technical defeat which we are most like to receive isn’t 
beneficial to anybody.’

Should be punished: Players and umpires go to Shunin's aid after the incident which Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said people should be imprisoned for it

Dynamo, who were leading 1-0 when the 
game was abandoned after 36 minutes, feel Zenit should be penalised with
 a technical defeat while the St Petersburg outfit insist the 
troublemakers were not true fans of the club.

The Russian Premier League’s control and disciplinary committee are due to hold a meeting on the incident tomorrow or the next day to decide on whether either team should be issued a penalty, which could mean a technical defeat.

If caught, the perpetrator is likely to be charged with hooliganism which includes a 300,000-500,000 rubles fine (£6,000-10,000) and a possible jail term of up to five years.

A fourth-round Russia Cup tie between Dynamo and their local rivals Torpedo was called off in September when fans threw fireworks and smoke bombs on to the pitch.
