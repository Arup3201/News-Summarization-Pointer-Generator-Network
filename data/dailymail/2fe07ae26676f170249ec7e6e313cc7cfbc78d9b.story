She was a contemporary icon who suffered a very modern death but Amy Winehouse appears every inch the Tudor lady in a portrait painted by fine art student Aaron Illsley, 21.

Renamed Lady Winehouse of Southgate, the Enfield artist has given the singer, who died two years ago, an exquisite golden dress - although her trademark beehive remains in place.

And Illsley hasn't stopped at Winehouse. The portrait is part of a series of paintings of deceased celebrities who have been 'Tudorised' by the artist.

The paintings, which also show Beatles star John Lennon, frontman of glam rock group T. Rex Marc Bolan and Sex Pistols singer Sid Vicious, were commissioned by Grade I-listed Henry Tudor House bar and restaurant in Shrewsbury.

'I spent a lot of time at the V&A and the fashion museum, looking at patterns and clothing,' explained Aaron.

'I didn't want to be accused of copyright [theft] so I had to make a lot of it up. I did research [Henry VIII's court painter] Hans Holbein the Younger's paintings, along with Rembrandt and Agnolo Bronzino to get the colours right.

'I'd never done anything like this before. I usually work from photographs. I was quite surprised how they turned out. They work really well in the context of the bar. I'm very happy with them.'

It was bar owner Graham Jenkins who 
came up with the concept of 'Tudor-fying' contemporary musicians to 
adorn the walls of his oak-framed restaurant and pub

The
building dates back to the early 1400's and once sheltered the founding
king of the Tudor dynasty, Henry VII, who was en route to the Battle of
Bosworth where his army dispatched King Richard III and ended the 
Plantagenet line.

Graham's son Sam, 20, a guitarist studying commercial music in his final year at Bath Spa University, introduced his dad to fellow student Aaron and the project took flight.

'He sent me Aaron's self-portrait and I thought "this is a guy who can really paint",' said Graham.

Aaron, who takes a month to complete each painting, is currently working on a portrait of the very much alive Dr Dre, which will depict the rapper with headphones in the style of Botticelli's Birth of Venus.

Graham said: 'Music is an integral part of what we offer here. We attract some brilliant touring artists, looking for an intimate venue.

'I thought that having pop icons painted to a medieval theme would be in tune with the surroundings.

'Aaron is under threat of death not to repeat the work. We've had such a positive reaction that we're thinking about getting prints done. It is Marc Bolan, of T. Rex who attracts the most attention, perhaps because he's a bit more niche.

'We've had people making pilgrimages here just to see him. One lady comes in every two to three weeks and keeps increasing her offer on the John Lennon picture - we've had offers of five times what it cost to paint but we are not considering selling.'

He said he thought the paintings might now be worth 'thousands of pounds'.

The paintings are unprotected, as Graham wants them to 'live and breathe with the building' and Amy's has already been splashed with wine. 'That doesn't happen in the National Gallery,' he added.

Aaron says he is still exploring his potential as an artist and is unsure, as yet, where it will take him, but is open to further commissions.

'I don't understand my potential in painting yet,' he said. 'I would like to think I can do more. I would love to be a commissioned artist, earning my living from painting.'
