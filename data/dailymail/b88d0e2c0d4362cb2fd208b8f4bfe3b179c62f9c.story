The five-month-old baby revived on the side of a Florida highway last month after he stopped breathing while in the car with his aunt had problems with his trachea, his family revealed at a news conference Wednesday.

The baby, Sebastián de la Cruz, returned home on Friday after spending more than a week in the hospital after his aunt, Pamela Rauseo, stopped on the side of busy State Route 836 to give little Sebastian mouth-to-mouth after she noticed him turning blue.

Doctors later detected - and removed - three cysts from the boy's trachea that were making it difficult for him to breathe, his parents told reporters.

Rauseo told reporters that the international attention the story received has been a bit hard to handle.

'We didn’t know how to handle all this, 
and it was uncomfortable for me,' Rauseo said at a press conference Wednesday at the Hachar 
Law Firm in Miami Lakes. 'The truth is that it got out of our control.'

Rauseo, 37, was driving on one of the busiest highways in Miami after taking Sebastian to the hospital for some tests.

The newborn was born prematurely and suffers with respiratory issues and had recently had some congestion.

His aunt, who regularly looks after him whilst his mother is at work, was taking the him back home when suddenly everything in the car fell silent.

When Sebastian stopped crying and fell quiet in the back of the car, his aunt Pamela Rauseo knew something was wrong

'I was driving along the 836 Dolphin Expressway and he was crying. He's always crying. Even when the car is moving, he's constantly crying,' said Ms Rauseo, speaking to the MailOnline.

'We had come to a stop as we were stuck in traffic when suddenly the crying stopped. Everything was dead quiet. I knew something was wrong immediately.'

Struck by panic, Ms Rauseo made the decision to pull over and to find out what was wrong.

Adding to the drama, she was unable to see the little boy either by turning around or in her rear-view mirror because his car seat was facing away from her.

'He was in the rear of the car but I couldn't even check to see if he was still breathing,' she recalled.

Ms Rauseo pulled over in the fast lane of the highway, placed the car in park and raced around to open the back door.

When she got round to the back of the car, her instinct proved to be correct.

Sebastian had lost his pinkish glow and was slowly turning blue.

'He had lost all color and was limp. Completely limp! It was frightening.'

She
 took the car seat out and placed in on the ground by the side of the 
vehicle whilst she began to perform CPR on the child, realising how delicate 
her motions would have to be given how very young the baby was.

'I don't know how I remembered what to do. I just knew I couldn't let him die!'

'I
 began to shout for help,' Ms Rauseo said. 'I screamed for people to 
come over and help but not many people knew how to give CPR to a 
five-month-old.'

With traffic at a standstill, fellow drivers began to help. A police officer and two firefighters who were stuck in traffic rushed to her aid.

Another driver, Lucila Godoy left her own son in the car to assist in CPR and comfort Rauseo.

By sheer coincidence, an award-winning photographer for the Miami Herald newspaper was passing by and captured a series of dramatic pictures showing the emergency crews saving the baby's life.

He said that he heard a woman screaming that the baby couldn't breathe.

Al Diaz placed a  call 911 and a team of paramedics raced to the scene.

Mr
 Diaz was able to capture some stunning images that capture the drama 
and tension of the entire scene that happened at the side of the 
eight-lane highway.

Shortly 
after the call was made, police Officer Amauris Bastidas arrived, 
helping as Ms Rauseo twice got the baby breathing again.

'He started breathing and crying. Then he started not breathing again,' Bastidas said.

Just as the baby started to catch his breath, more help arrived after Anthony Trim and Alvaro Tonanez from Miami-Dade Fire Rescue heard the emergency call while stuck in traffic.

The rescue workers were able to keep Sebastian breathing until paramedics arrived at which point the professionals were able to take over.

Ms Rauseo knows just how incredibly lucky she was to have had strangers help save her nephews' life.

Baby
 Sebastian is now back in hospital where he is undergoing further tests.
 His mother, Paola Vargas, is a registered nurse and is desperate to 
understand how and why her son stopped breathing.

Sebastian was photographed later that day in his mother's arms, smiling, the color having returned to his face.

Ms
 Rauseo works is an interior designer and runs Round321, a company 
dedicated to designing innovative and unique pieces for parents and 
children.

Her company crafted Sebastian’s nursery and regularly babysits bubbly boy when his mother is at work.

The Red Cross plans to recognize Rauseo's courageous efforts at a ceremony on March 13.

A trust has been set up for Sebastián at babyseba.com.
