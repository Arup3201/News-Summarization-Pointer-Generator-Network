One family got the surprise of a lifetime on Valentine's Day.

Rodney Gist of Fullerton, California, took his son and daughter out for a ride in their kayak on Santa Barbara harbor when the group was joined by an adorable guest - a baby sea lion.

And while the family was nervous at first to have the wild animal join them, the sea lion proved to be a delightful guest.

The sea lion even nuzzled with Gist a bit before returning to the ocean

'At first it felt like he was pushing the kayak. We felt him back there,' Gist told KTLA.

'Next thing you know, I could tell he had climbed aboard.' 

The pup, which the family decided to name Cecil, even spent some time nuzzling with Gist as he quietly sat at the back of the kayak. 

'Maybe he just was tired of swimming. Maybe he was wanting to interact with people. Maybe he just wanted to snuggle,' said Lee Lee, Gist's daughter.

Soon, the people around them began to take notice too, and while the sight of the pup on the kayak was exciting for them, it seems lt was too much for the baby, who soon returned back to the ocean.

Lucky for the family, the moment was all caught on video.
