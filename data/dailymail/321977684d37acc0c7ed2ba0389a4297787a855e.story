Crystal Palace have shown an interest in Sevilla midfielder Stephane Mbia. The 28-year-old is available on a free transfer and is keen on a return to the Premier League.

The  holding midfielder, who is currently on Africa Cup of Nations duty with Cameroon, is on a short-term contract with Spanish side Sevilla but has an agreement with the club that he can leave in this window.

Palace, as well as Everton, have already held tentative talks with his representatives and the 28-year-old is ready to make the move back to England where he has retained a flat in Chelsea.

Between 2009 and 2012, Mbia played for Marseille in France before moving to the Premier League with QPR

Mbia had a spell at Queens Park Rangers in 2012 after joining in a swap deal that saw Joey Barton go on loan to Marseille. Rangers suffered as their large influx of new players failed to gel and they were relegated. 

However, Mbia went on loan to Sevilla where he showed his ability and helped guide Sevilla to Europa League victory over Benfica, scoring his penalty in the shootout.

He was named in the Europa League team of the year and was nominated for best African player in the Spanish league.

He is now on a short-term deal at La Liga side Sevilla, and has played 11 times for them

His agent Jean-Paul Ndoumin said: 'Stephane signed a short-term contract with Sevilla as he wanted the opportunity in this window to discuss a return to the Premier League. It is a league that excites him and one he believes is the most challenging and he likes a challenge. 

'He feels the Premier League didn't see the best of him at QPR and he wants to put that right. He doesn't want to wait until the last minute; he is ready to move now.'

Several Premier League sides are searching for a holding midfielder and Mbia has the attributes. He can also sign a pre-contract for the summer.
