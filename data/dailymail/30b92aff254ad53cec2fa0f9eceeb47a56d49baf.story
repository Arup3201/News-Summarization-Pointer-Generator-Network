Seven decomposing sperm whale carcasses will be removed from a beach in South Australia after their repulsive smell has been discouraging tourism.

It had previously been suggested by environmental experts that the whale corpses, which appeared south of the town of Ardrossan, about 150km North West of Adelaide, would be left to decompose naturally.

But Yorke Pensinsula Council has now said the repulsive odour from the whales has left the council no choice but to remove the carcasses.

Seven beached sperm whales washed ashore on Yorke Peninsula in South Australia this week

Andrew Cameron, CEO of the Yorke Peninsula Council, told Daily Mail Australia that two of the whales have already been disposed of.

'We buried two of the whales today. The museum is dissecting one for research, and the rest of them will likely be taken care of tomorrow.'

Mr Cameron said the area where the whales appeared is a prominent site for crabbing, and strong winds were pushing the odour onto the nearby Adrossan township.

'There was a news team here today, and they were dry reaching from the smell. It's horrendous' he said. 

Environment Department spokeswoman Deb Kelly previously told ABC the whales might be left to decompose naturally since the beach is not a popular swimming spot. 

But Mr Cameron claims the odour has already been hindering tourism, with would be visitors cancelling their trips over the incident.

Yorke Council Mayor Ray Agnew predicted it could cost up to $50,000 to remove the whales, as well as assistance from local businesses.

'We're trying to use the ingenuity of local staff seeing as we don't appear to be getting much assistance at all from the State Government who actually said they haven't got anything that can handle it,' he told ABC.  

Six of the  whales were found on about six kilometres south of Adrossan, while the seventh was found by a jetty.

Environment Department regional co-ordinator Grant Pelton told Adelaide Now that an eighth whale was found in a deeply distressed state. 

'DEWNR staff and a Department of Transport, Planning and Infrastructure Marine Safety officer located a live seven-metre sperm whale in 1.5 metres of water at Pt Vincent,' regional co-ordinator he said.

'The animal was very lethargic but after some time they managed to encourage it out into deeper water where it dived and they haven't seen it since. They will remain in the area to confirm it doesn't come into the shallows again.' 

Experts believe that there could be many explanations as to why the whales got into trouble. 

One such theory is that one of the whales was sick and went into shallow water, when it felt better it may have called for help from the rest of the pod.

Another explanation may be that the pod were chasing food and got caught in the low tide. 

The whales were found 50m offshore at Parara Beach, about 4km south of Ardrossan

Environment Department animal welfare manager Dr Deborah Kelly was distressed to see the whales on the beach. 

'This is rare,' Dr Kelly said. 'Unfortunately things like this have been happening for thousands of years.' 

The witness said that one of the whales was still flapping it's tail this morning at 8am, but stopped a short while later. 

The National Marine Mammal Laboratory say male sperm whales can grow up to 60 feet and may live to be 50-70-years-old. 

They say that while sperm whales typically die of natural causes, they are known to mass strand.
