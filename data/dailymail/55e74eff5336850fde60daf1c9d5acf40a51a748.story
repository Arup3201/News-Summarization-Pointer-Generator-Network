More than six months after his death, Casey Kasem has finally been laid to rest, reports say.

The body of the legendary DJ was buried last Tuesday at Vestre Gravlund in Norway after months of his remains going unburied amid accusations of murder, fraud, and mistreatment of the famed American Top 40 Countdown DJ, TMZ reports. 

It is unclear whether Jean Kasem, Kasem's wife of more than 30 years, was at the funeral, TMZ reports, but the children were not. In fact, Kasem's children didn't know that he had been buried until Monday.

The ceremony was reportedly a small one, according to Los Angeles Mercury News.

Kasem, who voiced the character 'Shaggy' in Scooby-Doo, died in June at the age of 82. 

When his health deteriorated, especially during the star's final year, the warring between Kasem's wife and his children from his first marriage began.

Jean forbid anyone from seeing Kasem, this spawned a series of court proceedings, public jabs, and accusations. 

Soon, the ordeal became an international spectacle.

Recently the slew of Casey Kasem headlines have focused on his widow, Jean. 

The Los Angeles Police Department is conducting an elder abuse investigation due to claims by Kasem's children that Jean took the elderly man on a joy ride one month before his death, resulting in Kasem getting a fatal infection.

Forbes reports that Kasem's family hoped to have Kasem buried in California, but some speculate that Jean had her late husband's body taken to Norway in an attempt to avoid returning to California where the investigation is being conducted.

For most of a year, Casey Kasem's name has been pinned to feuds and accusations, and with matters of insurance policies and an investigation still at hand, the battle may be far from over.

However, at least the beloved star has finally been laid to rest.
