Paralysed by grief, Sarah Ambrose could not bear to look at her son’s  belongings after he was killed at the Battle of the Somme.

So 18-year-old Edward Ambrose’s possessions were packed in a leather suitcase and stored away in the attic of the family home.

And there they stayed for more than 90 years – until curiosity finally got the better of Edward’s nephew John, 82, who retrieved the case after reading about an appeal for untold stories for a First World War exhibition.

The 'time capsule' includes a locket containing photos of Private Ambrose and his sweetheart 'Gladys', who he left at home to go and fight on the Western Front

Amazingly, Private Ambrose's nephew, John, also found two fragments of the German shell which killed his uncle in the Battle of the Somme on July 6, 1916. Records show in was struck in the leg by a shell when his line came under heavy bombardment

Touchingly, the case included a guide book to Paris, which Private Ambrose sadly never got to visit. A picture of Private Ambrose's grieving mother Sarah, right

The case contains poignant reminders of Private Ambrose's final days before his death, including a half-smoked pipe and ten cigarettes in a case designed to take 14

Among the photos in the case is one of Private Ambrose, third from the right, stood outside his home near Baldock, Hertforshire with three of his fellow soldiers and his father, Samuel, right

Another of his photos shows him and fellow soldiers at the Duke of Bedford's Training Depot in Ampthill, Bedfordshire in 1915. He joined the 6th Battalion of the Bedfordshire Regiment

The locket Private Ambrose gave to Gladys contained the inscription 'Mizpah', meaning emotional bond, and the message: 'The Lord watch between me and thee when we are absent from one another'

Private Ambrose's half-smoked pipe. His grieving parents found it too difficult to open the case of his personal belongings and put it into storage, where it has remained for 98 years

The case contains heartfelt letters sent by Private Ambrose from the front to his parents back home. He states that he 'takes pleasure' in writing them, and signs off 'Your loving son, Ted'

Opening it, he was confronted with a 
poignant collection of letters and photographs alongside a locket with a
 picture of fresh-faced Edward on one side and his sweetheart Gladys on 
the other.

In a letter from Samuel Ambrose to his son before he went off to war, the father wrote: 'Dear son, just a few lines to you trusting they will find you quite well and in the best of health.

'No doubt you will think it strange to get a letter from dad but I thought I must just write you a few lines before you sail away from home.

'I remind you that you are quite young so therefore you must try and take great care of yourself and don’t forget to ask your heavenly father to help you.

'We will all pray to God for you and for your safe return home again when the war is ended and trust in him that it may soon be finished with and lasting peace so that we all live happily again.

'Take great care of this letter and read it sometimes and then you won’t forget to do what I have asked of you.

'Let us know as often as you can how you are getting along and if there is anything that you want if we can.

'I think this is all so with all our best love from one and all to you and heaps of kisses, your loving dad S Ambrose.'

There were also Army issue booklets, posthumously awarded 
campaign medals and everyday paraphernalia, including cigarette papers 
and even a pipe with tobacco still in it.

Incredibly,
 the case also contained two fragments of the German shell that 
inflicted the fatal wounds on Private Ambrose shortly after he went to 
the front in July 1916.

Also
 in the time capsule was a guide book to Paris, which the young soldier 
never got the chance to visit, and a phrase book titled ‘What a British 
soldier wants to say in French and how to pronounce it’.

There was also a
 letter which his father Samuel, a farm bailiff  from Wallington, near 
Baldock, Hertfordshire, wrote to his son on the eve of him going to 
France in February 1916.

It 
said: ‘We will all pray to God for you and for your safe return home 
again. Take care of this letter and read it sometimes and then you won’t
 forget what I have asked of you. Your loving dad, S Ambrose.’

Private
 Ambrose, the eldest of six children, joined the 6th Battalion, 
Bedfordshire Regiment in 1915. After going to France, he spent two 
spells in hospital with German measles then tinnitus and shell shock, 
his service record shows.

His last letter home was dated July 6, five 
days into the Somme offensive and three days before he was fatally 
wounded. In it, he wrote of how he was thinking of when he would be 
going home again.

On July 9 
he was struck in the leg and head by shell fragments.

He died at the Red
 Cross Hospital at Etaples on July 13.

Found in the case was a telegram 
from the War Office to his mother,  who had asked if she could visit him
 while he was wounded in hospital.

The
 message declining her request as he was too ‘gravely wounded’ did not 
get to  her until the day after he died of his injuries.

A second 
telegram confirming his death arrived a few days later.

The
 case of possessions was inherited by Private Ambrose’s sister Margaret 
and then passed on to her sons John and David.

They got it out of the 
attic after seeing an appeal by the Herts at War project, an exhibition 
to mark the 100th anniversary of the start  of the war.

John,
 from Letchworth, Hertfordshire, said: ‘It was only when we opened the 
case that we realised the extent of the archive. It is a very moving, 
especially the letters.’

Private
 Ambrose is buried at the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery at Etaples in
 France. His belongings will go on display at the exhibition in August.

As part of his planned visit to Paris, Private Ambrose had also taken a French phrase book to the front, entitled: 'What a British soldier wants to say in French and how to pronounce it'

After a telegram telling of his death, his last belongings were sent back from the trenches to his heartbroken parents

But the family left the case unopened, finding its contents too painful to look at, and it was placed in an attic for years

After visiting a local historical exhibition, Private Ambrose's nephew has now opened the package for the first time
