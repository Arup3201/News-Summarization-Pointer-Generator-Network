New England Patriots vs Seattle Seahawks

Sunday, 11.30pm GMT (6.30pm ET)

University of Phoenix Stadium, Glendale 

The eccentric Seattle Seahawks defend their Super Bowl title against New England in Glendale, Arizona looking to become the fist team to win back-to-back title since the Patriots in 2004.

In his record sixth appearance in the NFL’s seasonal showpiece, will Tom Brady join the likes of Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana in winning four rings, or will Seattle make it back-to-back victories?

Here is our ultimate A to Z list ahead of this Sunday's blockbuster in Arizona.

Arizona

Hosts its third Super Bowl on Sunday. The Patriots have unfinished business in the Grand Canyon State after being denied a perfect season by Eli Manning’s unfancied New York Giants (and David Tyree’s infamous helmet catch) seven years ago. In other news, the Dallas Cowboys won their third title in four years with a 27-17 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Tempe in 1996.

Beast Mode

Marshawn Lynch may not talk to the media, but his rumblings on the field are as loud as anything in the NFL. The heart of this Seattle team, the bruising, angry 157 yards he accrued against Green Bay in the NFC Championship game propelled the Seahawks into consecutive Super Bowls. He’s nigh-on impossible to stop, but if the Patriots can contain him, that will go a long way to deciding the destination of the Vince Lombardi Trophy.

Commercials

Cost an eye-watering $4.5million for a 30-second slot; a $500,000 increase on last year. As a consequence, NBC has struggled to sell and after last year’s blowout the breaks during the first quarter are the most desirable.

Deflate-gate

Colts linebacker D’Qwell Jackson intercepted a Brady pass & thought something was amiss during the Patriots’ rout of Indianapolis a fortnight ago. As a consequence, the NFL is currently investigating the Patriots for using under-inflated footballs in the first half of the AFC Championship game. 

Depending on where you stand on Bill Belichick’s regime, they’re either win-at-all-costs cheats or unfortunate victims of an NFL sting. The investigation concludes after the Super Bowl, with a fine and lost draft picks dished out if found guilty.

Edelman, Julian

A quarterback at college, the Patriots wide receiver and punt returner has also turned his hand to video editing.

First downs

Will be key. New England already has 57 this postseason in only two games. The Seahawks have more than 20 fewer at 36. For more stats, click HERE

Gronkowski, Rob

Finally healthy for a Super Bowl, New England fans have to hope he’ll leave the kittens at home and give the Seahawks a 'Gronking to Remember’. He’s redefined the tight end position and is arguably the best of all-time, such is the impact made during his five-year career. He could be set for a monster afternoon as 11 of the 17 touchdowns Seattle conceded through the air this season were scored by tight ends. His alma mater is the University of Arizona, so expect antics galore if the Patriots win.

Hoody, The

Ahead of an unprecedented sixth Super Bowl trip, regardless of the result, Bill Belichick’s reputation as one of the NFL’s best ever coaches is unquestioned. But there’s a huge difference between 3-3 and 4-2 in Super Bowls, and the gnarled, stony-faced warrior will be desperate to win.

Island, Revis

Nobody has defended more passes since 2007, so it is little wonder that the Patriots plucked shutdown corner Darrelle Revis from free agency. Is he better than Richard Sherman? Seahawks receiver Doug Baldwin isn’t convinced, saying: ‘I'm going to bring my sunblock, my shades, and a hat and I'm going to go to Revis Island and see what I can do. And I'll let you know after the game.’

Jamie Collins

A strangely unheralded piece of the Patriots’ strangely underrated linebacking corps. The second-year Southern Miss graduate is a versatile chess piece whom NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth said can be as good as any player in the league. From lining up inside, blitzing, rushing the pass from outside and inside, he can do it all.

Katy Perry

Performing the half-time show at the Super Bowl with the eyes of the world watching is one of the biggest moments of any musician's career. Over the years the likes of Madonna, Beyonce and the Black Eyed Peas have graced the stage, but this weekend the honour will fall to Katy Perry.

The 30-year-old Californian superstar will headline the half-time show at this year's Super Bowl. Since bursting onto the scene with hit single I Kissed A Girl in 2008, Perry has had nine No 1 singles in the US as well as two No 1 albums. She promised that there will be nothing deflated about her performance on Sunday.

Legion of Boom

Despite losing Brandon Browner, one of its founder members, to the Patriots in free agency, Seattle’s secondary is as fearsome as they come. The little and large safety pairing of Earl Thomas and Kam Chancellor are almost without fault, while Byron Maxwell has slotted in perfectly opposite Sherman, the self-confessed ‘best corner in the game’. Meanwhile, nickel corner Jeremy Lane showed his credentials by scoffing at Gronkowski. ’I don’t think he’s that good, actually,’ he uttered. Oh boy.

MVP

A little-known linebacker called Malcolm Smith won the accolade - and a Chevrolet pick-up truck - a year ago. Brady is a two-time winner in 2002 and 2004 and has a chance to match Joe Montana in winning his third this Super Bowl MVP crown this weekend.

Ninkovich, Rob

A reincarnation of Mike Vrabel, the Patriots’ linebacker/defensive end/playmaker always seems to be near the ball when it counts.

Overtime

No Super Bowl has ever gone into a fifth quarter. Those in the know are predicting the tightest of encounters, so could that be about to change?

Pete Carroll

Went 27-21 in his three-year stint in New England, but in 2010, Seattle chose to take a punt on the enthusiastic coach after nine years at USC. Last year, he became the third coach to win a college national championship and a Super Bowl. Victory in Phoenix will see him becoming the seventh coach to win consecutive Super Bowls, joining an elite club of Vince Lombardi, Don Shula, Chuck Noll, Jimmy Johnson, Mike Shanahan and, of course, Belichick.

Quinn, Dan

Hailed as a defensive genius and a player’s coach, Seattle’s DC is off to replace Mike Smith as the Atlanta Falcons’ next head coach.

Referee

Eight years after suffering an aortic dissection and being told he would never again officiate an NFL game, Bill Vinovich is the man in the white cap on Sunday. And the Seahawks are 5-0 in games officiated by the accountant. Just saying.

Sherman, Richard

He’s brash, loud and a mathematics graduate from Stanford University. He also injured his elbow in the NFC Championship game and expect Brady to work him over early.

University of Phoenix Stadium

With a retractable roof and a field which moves in and out of the stadium on 500 steel wheels, it is an architectural specimen and one of the loudest stadiums in the NFL.

Vince Wilfork

With the 21st pick of the 2004 NFL Draft, the Patriots chose a franchise legend. Alongside Brady, Wilfork is the only survivor from the 2004 Super Bowl-winning side and could call it curtains if he claims his second ring.

Wilson, Russell

Like Brady, Wilson was underrated in the draft and eventually went to Seattle in the third round. The parallels don’t stop there: both reached two Super Bowls in their first three NFL seasons, with Brady’s Patriots going 40-12, while Wilson's are 42-13. Wilson’s 82 touchdowns and 31 interceptions beat Brady’s 75 and 41, with the Seattle man throwing for 11,591 yards, putting Brady’s 11,523 in the shade.

XLIX

The 49th instalment of the Super Bowl promises to be a classic. But we said that last year.

You still mad, bro?

The last time the Seahawks and Patriots met, Seattle announced themselves as a force in the NFL with a 24-23 victory. Richard Sherman made a beeline for Brady after the game and later tweeted his adversary to further rub salt in the wound.

Zolak, Scott

Played at quarterback for the Patriots under Carroll but he has also enjoyed some memorable moments as the team’s colour commentator. Perhaps none more so than this from 2013.
