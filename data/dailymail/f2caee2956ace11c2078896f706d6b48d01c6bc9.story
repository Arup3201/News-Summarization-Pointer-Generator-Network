Worrying: Hundreds of health service managers have pocketed pay-offs of up to £500,000 - but many have walked straight into new jobs in the NHS. Reforms were ordered in 2010 by the then Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, pictured

Hundreds of health service managers have pocketed pay-offs of up to £500,000 – but many have walked straight into new jobs in the NHS, a report reveals today.

Since 2010, the NHS has spent £430 million on redundancy packages for staff of departments scrapped under the  coalition’s health reforms.

But more than a fifth of those supposedly no longer needed have already found new jobs within the health service, and thousands more could follow.

They have exploited rules which mean they have to wait only four weeks before they can take a new post.

The National Audit Office report shows that one unnamed boss was handed a redundancy package worth £578,470 while hundreds of others received payments of more than £200,000.

But the Department of Health has refused to name any of these individuals – despite previously promising to be more open and transparent – claiming it would breach confidentiality rules.

Last night the ‘jobs merry-go-round’ was attacked by critics of public sector waste. 

The report has been published just a week after another NAO study revealed how the BBC broke its own rules in negotiating bumper pay-offs for departing staff.

NHS reforms were ordered in 2010 by the then Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in a bid to cut the number of managers and give more power to doctors and nurses.

They resulted in the abolition of hundreds of regional NHS bureaucracies, such as primary care trusts and strategic health authorities, and the creation of GP-led organisations called clinical commissioning groups.

But many senior doctors and other health professionals warned that the shake-up would cost the NHS vast amounts of money which would be diverted away from patient care.

Today’s report reveals that the reforms have so far cost the taxpayer £1.1billion, which included £435million on redundancy payments.

A total of 10,095 employees have been made redundant since May 2010, each receiving an average pay-out of £43,095.

But these figures do not 
take into account the redundancies in April when the reforms were 
officially implemented and many organisations were abolished.

The Department of Health has admitted the total cost of the reforms may rise to £1.7billion, including £680million in pay-outs.

It claims that the reforms will ultimately save the NHS £2.4billion in slashing unnecessary bureaucracy –although the report says it cannot confirm if this is the case.

But the report also points out that since the reforms, although 171 bodies were abolished, 240 were set up in their place – meaning there are now 70 more compared to three years ago.

The report also points out that 9 per cent of the 45,350 newly created posts have not yet been filled, meaning that more than 4,000 axed managers could walk straight into new jobs.

Hospitals and NHS organisations have been ordered to make £20billion of savings by next year so that budgets can be re-invested in better care for the elderly and more advanced treatments.

But in the face of such strict targets, many trusts have resorted to sacking nurses and other frontline staff, and rationing drugs and operations.

Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Health chiefs have wasted a breathtaking amount of taxpayers’ money on pay-offs when axeing staff.

‘The size of the pay-outs, particularly those handed to senior managers, appear to have been allowed to spiral out of control. Laying off staff at great expense to taxpayers only to hire them back is unacceptable.

‘This is all too typical of the NHS jobs merry-go-round that needlessly costs taxpayers a fortune.’

Andrew Gwynne MP, Labour’s shadow health minister, said: ‘This report lifts the lid on the Government’s shambolic re-organisation of the NHS.

Since David Cameron entered Downing Street over 4,000 nursing posts have been axed and one in ten hospitals are now short-staffed. Ministers are taking unacceptable risks with standards of patient care.’

Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the council of the British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said: ‘The findings of the National Audit Office echo many of our concerns about how the NHS reforms were devised and implemented.

‘Introducing radical changes to how the NHS is run and structured during a period of intense financial pressure has been a costly distraction to solving the real challenges facing the health service.

‘All the evidence is pointing to  a worsening financial situation  for the NHS, and the Government needs to urgently rethink  its approach.

‘Most of the savings have come from pay freezes and cuts in the tariffs for services, but this is neither sustainable or likely to deliver the long-term savings that are needed to protect patient services.’

A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ‘The changes made as a result of the reforms mean a huge net gain for the taxpayer. They will save £5.5billion during this Parliament and £1.5billion every year thereafter, to be reinvested back into patient care.

‘We have put doctors and nurses in the driving seat. They are best placed to take decisions about care for their patients – decisions that were previously taken by managers.

'They now have the freedom, power and budget to make sure their local communities get the care and services they really need.’

Thousands of patients’ confidential medical records are being lost by NHS staff every year, figures show.

Files containing highly personal information have been mistakenly left in drains, hospital car parks and even branches of WH Smith.

Freedom of Information requests show that hospitals made 2,805 confidentiality breaches in the past 12 months – a 20 per cent rise on the previous year.

In one example, at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, a letter informing a patient they had cancer was left in the car park.
