Maybe it’s his enormous, bulging brown eyes. Or the permanently wrinkled up-turned nose. Or it could be his pointy, over-sized ears.

There’s little doubt that Alan, a diminutive five-month-old French bulldog, has a certain je ne sais quoi.

‘Most people associate bulldogs exclusively with England, but this one’s different and definitely full of character,’ says Alan’s besotted owner, Lisa Bristow, a 31-year-old marketing director from London. ‘I can’t walk him down the street without people stopping and admiring him.’

All ears: French bulldogs are loved for their comical looks

They aren’t the only ones. The French bulldog — a kind of ‘bulldog-lite’ which emerged in the 19th century when traditional bulldogs were mated with pugs and terriers to create a miniature version — is one of the fastest growing breeds in Britain, with owners willing to pay £1,000 for one.

Last year, the Kennel Club received 6,990 new French bulldog registrations — an increase of 49 per cent on the previous year and of more than 1,000 per cent compared to ten years ago.

Enthusiasm for ‘Frenchies’ as fans call them, far exceeds enthusiasm for traditional British bulldogs — the Kennel Club had a thousand fewer registrations for the British breed.

Celebrity owners include the Beckhams, whose Frenchie Scarlet is a regular fixture on Victoria’s Twitter page — as well as fashion designer Henry Holland, former Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh and the Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon.

X-Men star Hugh Jackman is rarely seen without his cream-coloured French bulldog Dali, while Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding is devoted to her French bulldog Yogi.

So what is it about the Frenchie that has turned it into the dog du jour?

Certainly not their looks. With their squashed snouts, bulging eyes, stocky bodies and squat spindly legs, they’re unlikely to win any beauty prizes.

But for owners, their comical appearance is part of the charm. ‘They are known as the clowns of the canines, and it’s so true,’ says Daisy Dickinson, a 27-year-old beauty writer from Cambridge, whose dog is five-year-old Roxy.

Fans often post photos online of their Frenchies dressed up to look as ridiculous as possible. Some dogs have become celebrities in their own right.

Sir Charles Barkley, a 21-month-old cream Frenchie, appeared on a range of canine ‘hoodies’ after his owners set up an Instagram photo account that  attracted 200,000 followers on the picture-sharing site. Another, Trotter, has nearly 190,000. He is beloved for his exhaustive collection of hats.

French Bulldogs are particularly well-suited to owners who live in cities and work long hours.

They rarely grow taller than 12 inches or weigh much more than 2st, and dislike extreme temperatures, so are suited to indoor-living. They enjoy human company, are affectionate with owners, and good with children.

It’s not the first time Frenchies have experienced a moment in the spotlight. They were all the rage in mid-19th century France.

Despite their name, the dogs partly originated in Britain. They were introduced to the Continent by Nottingham’s lace workers who, displaced by machinery after the Industrial Revolution, moved to Normandy in search of work. In Britain, breeders had seen their size as a defect, but by the 1850s in France, they had become a Parisian must-have, known as ‘bouledogues francais’ and popular among artists, writers and high-society ladies.

Their return to favour now fits with a longer-term trend for diminutive breeds, or ‘handbag dogs’, which has already seen chihuahuas, pugs and miniature poodles enjoy a place in the spotlight.

Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko says: ‘People see a picture of a celebrity out carrying a small dog and want one, too.’

But although responsibly-bred Frenchies can enjoy long and healthy lives, living for more than a decade, the breed is prone to health problems.

Their short snouts and compact heads, the result of centuries of selective breeding, mean their airways are compacted. They struggle to regulate their temperature, and find breathing in warm weather difficult. Exposure to extreme heat can be lethal.

They also have notoriously delicate digestive systems, a reputation for flatulence and a tendency to allergies.

French bulldogs can suffer spine and knee pain, and tend to suffer eye problems, such as glaucoma, corneal ulcers and cataracts.

The Kennel Club has a register of ‘assured’ breeders on its website, who have been checked over and will only register certain colours of the breed — ‘brindle’, a mix of coloured and black hairs, such as Alan and Roxy; ‘pied’, predominantly white; and ‘fawn’, similar to brindle but with black eyelashes and rims.

Other colours, such as the grey-black 
‘blue’ bulldog beloved of celebrities are not approved because they 
often suffer from a condition which can result in hair loss and chronic 
skin inflammation.

Frenchie fans insist that - when properly looked after, this is a breed which can rival any other

And breeders with no Kennel Club affiliation advertise French bulldog puppies online — including Blues — for anything from £500 to £1,600.

Frequently, they are based abroad. Some unscrupulous Eastern Europeans breed them in pitiful conditions, and because pets from the EU no longer need to be quarantined, smuggling puppies has never been easier. Last year, the number of dogs coming from Romania increased by more than 1,000 per cent.

Another unexpected side-effect of the craze has been the recent wave in bulldog thefts.

In February, a seven-month-old French bulldog puppy was stolen from a garden in Aberdare, but was recovered two weeks later. A month earlier, a five-month-old French bulldog was stolen from a home in Stratford-upon-Avon.

And a man wielding a knife seized a two-year-old French bulldog from a home in Huddersfield in December.

Frenchie fans insist that — when properly looked after, this is a breed which can rival any other.

‘With careful, knowledgeable breeding and care, they can be healthy, lovable, funny little dogs with huge personalities and with no more or less problems than your average Labrador,’ adds Daisy Dickinson.

As for Roxy’s status as a fashion icon — it’s just an added bonus.

‘I can see why they’ve stolen the hearts of so many . . . Roxy’s my best friend and I adore her.’
