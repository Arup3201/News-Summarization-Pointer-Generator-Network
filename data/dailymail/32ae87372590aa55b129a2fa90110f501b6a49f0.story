Arsene Wenger and Neil Adams will wake up on Monday morning knowing they both face critical weeks.

The burden of Arsenal’s nine-year trophy drought will weigh heavily on Wenger’s shoulders in the coming days as he prepares his team for Saturday’s FA Cup Final against Hull.

Adams, meanwhile, will discover on Tuesday whether he will be handed the chance of trying to secure an instant return into the Barclays Premier League after Norwich’s relegation was confirmed by Sunday’s defeat.

The rookie boss wants the manager’s job on a full-time basis, but his team hardly did their best to ensure he has a chance of landing the role on a permanent basis as their top-flight journey ended with a whimper.

‘I’ve made my intentions clear, I want to stay on, to carry on working with the first team,’ said Adams.

‘I will find out by the end of the week. We are off on Monday, but we are back in on Tuesday and we’ll about it talk then.

‘It
 is inevitable clubs will be looking at our best players and it will be 
difficult to keep them, while one or two will be looking to leave.

‘But we want to keep as many as we can because we want to have a proper crack at coming straight back up.’

With
 Malky Mackay available to work again after dropping his legal case 
against Cardiff chief Vincent Tan and Tim Sherwood set to be on the 
market following his expected dismissal as Spurs manager, Adams’ chances
 look slim.

Adams’ job prospects are unlikely to register in Wenger’s thoughts this week, however.

He
 has bigger fish to fry; victory at Wembley on Saturday would provide the perfect stage for the Frenchman, whose existing deal expires next week, to 
announce he is staying on for an another two years.

Wenger
 underlined his intention to sign a new contract on Sunday, strongly 
rejecting the notion he could quit the Emirates Stadium for Monaco 
ahead of next season.

He's back: Jack Wilshere made his comeback from injury as a second-half substitute against Norwich

Jack Wilshere proved his fitness for Brazil with a second-half cameo for Arsenal that will ease Roy Hodgson’s fears.

The England boss would also have been encouraged by the performance of John Ruddy. The Norwich goalkeeper made several excellent saves to ensure his side weren’t embarrassed on the final day of the season.

‘I wish Monaco well, but there is no interest there,’ said Wenger.

‘Today was a good basis to prepare for the Cup final. The fact we got 79 points is proof that we have made progress.

‘Unfortunately
 it’s the first time a club finishes fourth with 79 points. It was a 
tight Premier League. Liverpool, Chelsea and us can be frustrated, the 
number of points made by the top teams is top quality. 

‘Whoever
 wins it deserves it, but Manchester City just got over the line without
 the brilliance they showed at the start of the season. They came from 
behind after having three games in hand.’

With
 Norwich’s relegation into the Championship virtually secured and 
Arsenal’s Champions League qualification sealed, there wasn’t much to 
invigorate the players ahead of kick-off.

And
 it showed as the clash got off to a subdued start, with the first 
effort of real note arriving in the 18th minute when Lukasz Fabianski - 
making his first league start of the season - parried Nathan Redmond’s 
long range effort.

The home 
side had John Ruddy to thank for not going in a half-time well behind as
 the England goalkeeper made three brilliant stops to deny Lukas 
Podolski and Olivier Giroud - his stop to thwart the Frenchman’s first 
effort particularly eye-catching.

The
 largely dour first-half was all forgotten in the 53rd minute, when 
Aaron Ramsey smashed home an exceptionally well-executed volley from 14 
yards after Giroud’s pinpoint cross to put Arsenal ahead.

Nine
 minutes later the Gunners doubled their lead through the unlikeliest of
 scorers, Carl Jenkinson slotting home Kieran Gibbs’ cut back to score 
his first goal for the club.

The
 right back, who grew up as a devoted Arsenal fan, celebrated like he 
had just scored the winner in Saturday’s Cup final at Wembley, not a 
meaningless clash at Carrow Road.

It
 was a fairytale moment, and there were more positives as Jack Wilshere 
made his return after an eight-week injury lay-off while Abou Diaby made
 his first appearance in 14 months following a serious knee injury.

Wenger will be hoping for more good times on Saturday.
