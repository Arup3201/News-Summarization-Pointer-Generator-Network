At the suitably-named Rock Restaurant, diners are provided with more than just fresh fish caught from the Indian Ocean below.

Breathtaking views and fresh sea air also greet visitors who come to this restaurant, in Zanzibar, East Africa.

The Rock, which opened last year, can be reached on foot, but at high tide diners need to be transported back to the mainland by boat.

The Rock Restaurant also has an outside dining area so the fresh sea air can be enjoyed

Providing inside dining and outdoor seating, it has proved a popular venue since its opening.

Restaurant partner Nigel Firman, 47, 
said: 'The Rock Restaurant is a magical place and is an experience you 
are never likely to forget.'

He added: 'If visitors come to the restaurant while the sea is low, they are able to walk to the rock with no problem.

'But
 as they usually stay late on into the evening when the sea is high 
around the rock, we provide a boat service which travels to and from the
 shore.'
