Dynasty: Ted Kennedy Jr announces his candidacy to run for Connecticut State Senate at Blackstone Memorial Library in Branford, Connecticut

Ted Kennedy Jr has finally given into the pressure to join the family business by agreeing to make a bid for political office.

The
 son of the well-respected late U.S. senator from Massachusetts will 
stand for election to the Connecticut state senate, after a long legal 
career.

Hundreds turned out
 yesterday for his official announcement at a carefully choreographed 
rally in his home town of Branford, where his comments drew standing 
ovations from the crowd.

'I'm proud of my 
family's legacy of standing up for working families, for political, 
social and economic justice,' the 52-year-old said.

He
 claimed to share the same consensus building philosophy as his late 
father, who died in 2009 and was widely regarded as the U.S. Senate's 
most prominent liberals.

'We
 need people in government, both Democrat and Republican, who are able 
to build bridges and find common ground,' he said while joined on stage 
by his wife and two children.

Mr
 Kennedy, whose voice boomed like his father's at times, revealed that 
his father was among those who had encouraged him to run for office over
 the years.

But he said he wanted to raise his family and develop his own expertise on the issues before running.

'I
 have been a fighter for children and families that have been impacted 
by environmental contamination and lead poisoning,' he was quoted as 
saying by ctpost.com.

As
 well as his work as a lawyer specialising in health issues, Mr Kennedy 
serves on the board of the American Association of People with 
Disabilities.

He said a life of advocacy grew from the loss of his leg to cancer as a child.

He
 told the audience at the Blackstone Library of the 
horror that he felt when he learned as a 12-year-old that doctors would 
have to amputate the limb.

He thought his life was over, he said, but the experience had eventually helped him appreciate the needs of others.

When
 he met another boy who lost his leg and learned he couldn't afford an 
artificial one, he said he resolved to do something with his life and 
make sure others did not have to experience such hardship.

Experience: His decision to stand for office comes after a long career as a lawyer and disability campaigner

Heir apparent: Retiring senator Ed Meyer presented Mr Kennedy at the rally at the Blackstone Library

Patrick
 Kennedy, who represented Rhode Island in Congress for 16 years until he
 retired in 2011, said on Monday that his brother's life was transformed
 when he lost his leg.

Borrowing
 a phrase from their illustrious uncle, President John F. Kennedy, he 
said his brother became a 'profile in courage' by surviving and becoming
 a champion for people with disabilities.

The
 younger Kennedy is making a bid for the Democratic nomination for the 
12th Senatorial District representing towns near New Haven, which since 
2002 has been represented by Democrat Edward Meyer.

Mr Meyer, 79, who is to retire at the next election, introduced Mr Kennedy at the rally as his heir apparent.

It's
 a far lower profile seat than the U.S. Senate, where Mr Kennedy's name 
has been mentioned as a possible candidate, but the lawyer says he 
believes he can make an impact at state level.

Modest: Mr Kennedy's name has been touted as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, and he said his father too had tried to persuade him to run, but the lawyer said he believes he can make a difference at the state level

There are no other declared candidates in the race, but Republicans have vowed to vigorously contest the seat.

State Republican Party Chairman Jerry Labriola Jr. said his party has several quality candidates interested in running.

He told ctpost.com: 'Sen. Meyer has been increasingly out of touch in a district which has been trending Republican.

'I
 can't imagine that the voters would now want to move further to the 
left of Sen. Meyer. This candidacy represents the same liberal orthodoxy
 employed by (Gov.) Dan Malloy, which is driving people out of our state
 and wrecking our economy.'

Finally! Gina MacDonald-Page poses with Mr Kennedy, whose candidacy for the Connecticut senate seat comes after years of pressure to join in the family business

Darrell
 West, a former Brown University professor who wrote a book on Patrick 
Kennedy, told the Associated Press that Ted Kennedy Jr's decision to run
 for state office makes sense.

'Even
 if your last name is Kennedy you have to establish yourself,' said 
West, vice president of governance studies at the Brookings Institution.

'It still creates the opportunities to run for higher office down the road.'
