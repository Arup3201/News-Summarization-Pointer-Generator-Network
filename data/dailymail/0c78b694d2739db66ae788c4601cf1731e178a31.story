[captionPolice have admitted they are baffled by the cause of death of a man and woman found in a Staten Island Hilton on Friday - their arms lovingly entwined as the two lay on the bed of room 401.

The NYPD have said that they are waiting on the results of autopsies on Theresa Mateo, 34 and Scott Jacobi, 37, but that all signs point towards a double suicide.

The pair were found at 1 p.m. by hotel staffers who investigated when they did not check out.

The New York Post reports that an unnamed hotel employee said they were discovered fully clothed by a housekeeper.

Sources at the NYPD have said that they believe the couple died of a drug overdose.

The source added they were 'advised by the New York City Police Department that it was an overdose.'

However, the city medical examiner's office will not officially confirm the cause of death until the autopsies are completed.

'There was no blood, nothing like that, no signs that weapons were used,' the employee said.

'It's really said. They were in their mid-thirties. That's young,' they added. 'Thank God we found them quick.'

The pair checked in Wednesday at 6 p.m..

Once the bodies were found, police blocked the room off using a portable partition.

Jacobi's neighbor described him as good-natured and hard-working.

'He
 was such a good guy,' said Terry Delre, who lived next door to Jacobi 
for six years. 'He was such a sweetheart...I called him my second son. 
Clean cut, hardworking, no wild parties, no nothing. I never once seen 
that boy drunk.

'I can't even picture this,' she added. 'He was such a stable-minded guy. I can't image what transpired.'

Adding
 to the mysterious circumstances: the couple left no note, no weapons 
were discovered, and the room contained no evidence of drugs or drug 
paraphernalia.
