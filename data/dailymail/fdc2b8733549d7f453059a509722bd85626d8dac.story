Thousands of children in a crime-ridden Mexican province are handing in their toy weapons in exchange for less violent alternatives, including footballs and Lego.

The campaign is aimed to prevent children growing up to use real guns and curb the violent culture of the area. 

Pretend guns, swords and rifles - and even real knives - were handed in by children in Nuevo León as part of a government campaign to promote a culture of peace amongst youngsters.

Children were given footballs, baseballs and basketballs to encourage participation in sports as well as yo-yos and building blocks. 

Patricia Salazar Marroquin, a local official, said the programme would promote peace and remove the incentive for violence in the playground.

She told The News: 'These actions remove the incentive for the use of violent games and promote family time in the community.'

She added the exchange will generate awareness among children about the negative aspect of the symbolism of violent toys in their daily lives of children and held them find ways to peacefully resolve conflicts.

It's not the first time a campaign like this has taken place in Mexico.

In Ciudad Juarez in 2011, children were asked to hand in pretend pistols as part of the Children's Festival for Peace.

Mexico has seen a wave of drug-related violence in recent years. 

Nuevo León's capital Monterrey, one of the country's wealthiest cities and formerly one of the safest, has seen a spike in cartel violence.

In October last year, a 20-year-old cartel assassin admitted killing 45 people, and was linked to 34 other murders.

He was caught in Monterrey where he was allegedly selling drugs. 

The drug war has escalated over the past few years as cartels battle each other for control of smuggling routes in the US.

Around 1,000 people a month die in gangland killings in Mexico and about 80,000 people have died since 2007 in drug-related violence.
