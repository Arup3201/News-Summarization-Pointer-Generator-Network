Teenagers across the UK are being treated for liver disease usually associated with a decade or more of heavy drinking.

Two 17-year-olds, an 18-year-old and two 19-year-olds have been treated for alcohol-related liver disease in UK hospitals over the last three years.

Cirrhosis of the liver is normally associated with binge drinking for ten years or more, but experts have suggested it is now occurring over a shorter period.

According to information obtained by The Sunday Times, an 18 and a 19-year-old have both been treated for alcohol-related liver disease at University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust.

The two 17-year-olds, meanwhile, were treated at St James's University Hospital in Leeds and Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.

The second 19-year-old was treated at Royal Free Hospital in North London.

The paper also reported that at least one patient in their 20s with the condition received a transplant.

A doctor from Addenbrooke’s, Dr Alexander Gimson, told the paper the ‘portentous’ figures were in line with research showing that the age at which people suffer and die from alcohol-related liver disease is getting younger.

The revelation follows figures released in September showing that 6,580 under-18s – and 293 children aged 11 and under – were admitted to A&E for alcohol-related admissions.

Meanwhile, it was reported in The Sun today that cases of foetal alcohol syndrome - where babies are left deformed or disabled by their mother's drinking during pregnancy - rose by 48 per cent between 2009-10 and 2012.

Last year, doctors saw 313 cases of the condition, up from 212 in 2009-10.

Drinking during pregnancy can affect children's facial features, hearing and numerous diseases.

Phoebe Haffenden, from New Milton, Hampshire, would drink an astonishing six litres of cider a day

This week the Mail reported on a 
19-year-old girl who was given months to live by doctors after daily 
alcohol binges left her body ravaged.

Phoebe
 Haffenden, from New Milton in Hampshire, would consume an astonishing 
six litres of cheap cider a day, was warned by doctors that her body was
 close to shutting down.

The
 teenager, who is still 19, from New Milton in Hampshire, started 
drinking at just 15, but her habit spiralled out of control and she was 
soon drinking a litre of vodka at a time.

Her
 addiction became so extreme she was kicked out of her family home and 
would suffer uncontrollable shakes and terrifying hallucinations.

After
 a four-year battle with alcohol, in July last year, Phoebe spent ten 
days in a detox clinic and is starting to get her life back on track.

She
 was told that she had a kidney infection and her body was so dependent 
on alcohol that to go cold turkey could have killed her.

Instead she was weaned off gradually, using withdrawal medication.

Fortunately
 her body is young and will repair itself from any damage caused by the 
alcohol, but if she drinks again she could risk overdose.

Now Phoebe is back at home and has started an acting course at her local college.
