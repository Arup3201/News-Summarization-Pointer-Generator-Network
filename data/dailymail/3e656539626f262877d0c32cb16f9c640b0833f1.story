Gary Lineker claims England are ‘a generation behind’ Germany as Joachim Low’s team attempt to win the country’s fourth World Cup against Argentina.

Lineker has been critical of the England regime in the past, but believes Roy Hodgson’s team showed signs of a promising future despite their early exit.

England were out of the tournament after defeats against Italy and Uruguay in their opening two group games in Brazil.

Expert opinion: Former England striker Lineker has been in Brazil covering the World Cup for the BBC

On Sunday Germany will attempt to win the World Cup for the fourth time in their history against Argentina in the Maracana.

The former England striker said: ‘When you look to Germany, they have always managed to get it right. It’s all about youth development.

‘We’ve made strides but they’re very recent strides and we’re a long way behind. 

‘The future’s brighter. I wouldn’t be too bleak about it. Were going along the lines of what Germany and Spain have done. We’re just a generation behind.

Leader: Thomas Muller has already scored 10 World Cup goals in his first two tournaments

In reserve: Andre Schurrle has proven an effective substitute for Germany

Talent: Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is as adept with his feet as many of the outfield players

‘A couple of defeats and you are gone - that’s the danger of World Cups. 

‘There was huge disappointment, but at the same time we all knew before this tournament that most of our players were too young and very inexperienced and our experienced players were perhaps a little bit too mature.

'The truth was realised, but at the same time we weren’t that bad in the games. There was a bit of promise.

'I don’t think it was as depressing as four years ago when you couldn’t see much future. Whereas with this bunch in two years time, four years time there is reason for hope.’

'We are addressing issues. It’s unbelievable that it’s only in the last two or three years we’ve started with small sided pitches and small goals. Finally we’ll get kids trying to pass the ball to each other rather than lump it up to the other end of the pitch.

'At least it’s here. And the academies are getting better coaches. Kids are learning to play. That’s why we’re seeing an emergence. That’s why we’re seeing the Under-17s and Under-20s doing better in international football.

Emergence: Raheem Sterling has broken into the England team

Progress: Daniel Sturridge is beginning to show his club form for England

Next generation: Ross Barkley is among a number of talented English youngsters

New look: Adam Lallana is a recent and exciting addition to the England set-up

'With the emergence of the Sterlings and Barkleys and the Sturridges and the Lallanas and the Wilsheres – players than can actually play, and keep the ball, there’s reason for hope.

‘There aren’t too many countries in the world where you’ve three organisations running the game. 

‘It doesn’t help because they’re all in a bit of a fight for power. Ultimately if we can develop enough players, the balance of foreign players isn’t great, but that’s because we’re not producing enough players. 

‘Most clubs would actually like homegrown players because they’re a lot cheaper. We could do with one or two managers giving the homegrown youngsters a chance, like Brendan Rodgers has done at Liverpool. We need a bit more of that.’
