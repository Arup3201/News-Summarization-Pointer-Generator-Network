Bill and Hillary Clinton weren't 'dead broke' for very long at all after leaving the White House, it was revealed Thursday.

In an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer that aired on Monday night, Hillary Clinton said that she and her 
husband were charging $200,000 on average for speeches because they were seeped in debt when they came out of the White House.

'We
 came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt,' Clinton 
said. 'We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know,
 piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's 
education.'

'You know, it was not easy.'

Hillary
 was swiftly attacked as 'out of touch' after the comment, and on 
Tuesday morning she explained that she and Bill had racked up 'something like $12 million' in legal fees by the end of Bill's presidency.

'Bill and I were obviously blessed. We 
worked hard for everything we got in our lives and we have continued to 
work hard. And we've been blessed in the last 14 years,' Clinton told Good Morning America host Robin Roberts.

The 
financial 'struggles' the Clintons faced at the end of Bill's second term more than a decade ago are 
but a distant memory, however.

In the first year Bill was out of office, the Clinton's made $12.3 million.

In
 2004 Bill locked down an unheard of $15 million advance for his 
autobiography My Life, and, as of last year, he had made $106 million 
off of speeches.

His net worth as of last February was $55 million, and he has
 continued to make money off of speeches since.

Hillary
 Clinton has made roughly $5 million in speeches since leaving the State
 Department last year, and she had made more than $16 million in 
advances for her two memoirs, In Living History, 2003, and Hard Choices,
 2014.

She also earned approximately $2 million during her second career, first as United States Senator and later Secretary of State.

Bill has also accrued $2.6 million of his White House pension.

Together, the couple has a net worth of $100 million or more.

All former presidents receive an annual pension based on how much they were paid while in office.

No other modern president has made quite the killing that Bill has off of speeches and books, however.

Jimmy
 Carter, who also left the White House broke, has made millions off of 
the 14 books he has written. But as of 2012 his net worth was only $7 
million, according to 24/7 Wall Street, and he has done nothing since that would have increased it dramatically enough to rival the value of Bill Cllinton's assets,

Bill Clinton is the richest of the five living U.S. presidents. From left to right they are, President Barack Obama, former President George W. Bush, former President Bill Clinton and former President George H.W. Bush. They are pictured here at the opening ceremony of the George W. Bush Presidential Center April 25, 2013 in Dallas, Texas

Likewise,
 George W. Bush's estimated net worth is less than half of Bill 
Clinton's.Â  In 2012 he was valued at $20 million after having made $7 
million off his 2010 book Decision Points and $15 million in speeches.

His
 father, former president George H.W. Bush has a net worth of $23 
million, but much of that comes from the value of his home and a 100+ 
acre estate he owns in Maine. In his hey day, H.W. Bush would charge anywhere from $60,000 - $80,000.

In 1993 H.W. charged a record-breaking $100,00 for a speech.

Bill Clinton has since topped that with a $750,000 speech.

President
 Barack Obama has the lowest net worth of all the living presidents, 
coming in at $5 million. Most of that money can be attributed to the 
royalties he received on the two books he wrote before becoming 
president, the 1995 hit Dreams from May Father and his 2006 book The 
Audacity of Hope.

In terms of the richest presidents ever, Bill Clinton ranks in the top 10.

The wealthiest American president in history, according to 24/7 Wall Street,
 was John F. Kennedy, who left behind $1 billion in shared assets with other members of the Kennedy family. His wife, 
Jackie Kennedy Onassis, was also very wealthy, and upon her death in 
1996, her estate was valued at $43.7 million.
