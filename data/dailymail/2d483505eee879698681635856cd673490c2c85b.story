A talented artist has given a whole new meaning to eye candy with intricate designs painted onto the eyelid.

Israeli make-up professional and blogger Tal Peleg Israel paints scenes from fairy tales, imagery from classic novels and pretty embellishments - including intricate designs of sushi - onto tiny areas of the face using only liquid eyeliner and eyeshadow.

Her clever mixing techniques and steady hand have won her global acclaim - and have seen the trend for eye art move towards the same sphere occupied by nail art.

One of Tal's specialities is recreating famous movie scenes and characters on the eyelid, which can take her up to three hours.

To celebrate the release of new Disney flick Frozen, Tal created two bespoke looks based on the movie's sisters Elsa and Anna.

She also creates more simple designs using smattering of pearls, glitter and stars.

Tal

woman more beautiful, but in general its ability to transform'.

She has more than 7,000 likes on 
Facebook and 9,000 followers on Instagram, where she posts regular 
updates of her new designs and inspiration.
