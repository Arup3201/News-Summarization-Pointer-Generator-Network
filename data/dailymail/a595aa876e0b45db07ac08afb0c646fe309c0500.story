A self proclaimed 'politically incorrect conservative culture warrior' has sparked outrage after he claimed  that Australia is revisiting its gun laws in light of a 17 hour siege in a Sydney cafe.

Nick Adams, while speaking to Fox News host Gretchen Carlson on Tuesday morning Sydney time, called for the weapons ban in Australia to be lifted and that citizens should have the right to be armed.

Adams claimed Australians had realised the 'bad guys' shouldn't be the only ones with guns following the hostage situation at the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Martin Place which saw two innocent people killed.

Nick Adams made unfounded claims about Australians reassessing gun control following the siege in Sydney

'I think for the first time in a long time Australians realised what it is for the bad guys to have guns, but the good people not to and there was a sense of despair, a sense of helplessness yesterday,' Adams said in a live cross to the program.

'And I know that there are a number of Australians this morning having woken up after a long, long, long night thinking to themselves what could have been if someone did have a gun on them to stop this terrible awful ordeal that people had to tragically endure,' he claimed.

When asked whether the events had sparked a debate about whether Australian should reevaluate it's gun control restrictions - which were introduced after the Port Arthur massacre in 1996 where 36 people were slaughtered  in one of the deadliest shootings committed by a single person worldwide - Adams claimed that people were already discussing it.

While on Fox News Adams also said the topic would be 'back on the agenda'

'I certainly think it will be back on the agenda, I think now Australians are beginning to realise what it means to not have a gun in a time when a bad person does.

'They realise that really it's enabling the bad people to be able to carry out their agenda a lot more easily, a lot more freely than they may otherwise have.'

He concluded by saying he 'can certainly see a change in sentiment' and 'I think there will be a reevaluation'. 

In an opinion piece published by the same network, the Sydney-born man continued to make unfounded and ignorant claims about Australian attitudes towards Islam and gun control.

'Monday’s distressing events have renewed Australians’ concerns about Islamist objectives, and a growing Islamic presence in the country,' Adams wrote.

'Interestingly, Monday’s events have also prompted Australians to revisit their gun laws,' he claimed, before adding: 'It is unsurprising that home-grown terrorism is most rampant in nations with strict gun control. It is a reality that Australia’s powerful anti-gun lobby seems to wish to ignore.'

In a final comment Adams wrote that Americans with their liberal gun control laws and second amendment are 'the envy of a growing number of Australians that wish they were armed.' 

Adams also made waves earlier this year during another appearance on Fox News touting claims that men 'all around the world' were losing their masculinity due to feminism.

'Basically what feminism has delivered is angry women and feminine men and it emerges from this mindset that unfortunately a lot of women have bought in to this destructive idea that men prevent them from being able to achieve their goals.'

Adams then when on to describe the 'phenomenon' as 'dangerous' and claimed 'it's a very hard time to be a man in today's society.' 

Adams is originally from Sydney but has a fierce passion for American culture and conservatism.

His website states he is: ' An inspirational author, international keynote speaker, and media commentator, he is considered an authority on American culture and the English-speaking world.'

While holding office in Ashfield in Sydney's inner-west in 2005 as the youngest deputy mayor in Australia, Adams attempted to ban pigeons from his electorate.

It was during the time the threat of bird flu was spreading across the world and he told ABC Radio National at the time he wanted to eradicate the birds in case they were carrying the disease.

'Ashfield should be inhospitable to pigeons. Avian influenza does not respect borders,' Adams said.

When asked how exactly he would implement such an exclusion zone around his municipality, he did not have a very effective solution.

'I'm not an expert. I'm not an accountant. I'm certainly not a pest controller. Don't ask me about procedure. What I would like to see is no pigeons in our area,' he responded.
