Experts have branded plans to give the taxman the power to raid individuals’ bank accounts without their permission ‘extremely worrying’, ‘excessive’ and potentially illegal.

The ‘unprecedented’ access – revealed in the Budget statement – could result in money being taken from innocent families, MPs were told yesterday.

The powers were outlined as part of measures to clamp down on tax avoidance. They would allow HM Revenue & Customs to seize unlimited amounts of money directly from the bank accounts of anyone they believe owes more than £1,000 in tax.

HMRC claims the new rules would be used to target ruthless tax dodgers.

Plans to give the taxman the power to raid individuals' bank accounts without their permission are potentially illegal according to experts. The 'unprecedented access' - revealed in the Budget statement - could result in money being taken from innocent families, MPs have been warned

But Frank Haskew, head of the tax faculty at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, told MPs it is ‘a fundamental tenet of our English law and our democratic society’ that money ‘cannot be grabbed from somebody’s account without a judge agreeing to the move’.

He said the change, which could come into force in just 12 months’ time, would be ‘unprecedented in the UK’.

He added: ‘At the end of the day, we can’t have HMRC as judge and jury on this.’

Mr Haskew said the tax authority had a long track record of making mistakes and harassing innocent taxpayers – and that it could end up targeting the wrong people.

In his written evidence to MPs, Mr Haskew said the current proposal is ‘of considerable concern to many taxpayers and accountants’.

‘These powers are extremely worrying and excessive,’ he added.

Patrick Stevens, tax policy director at the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said he feared vulnerable people could be wrongly charged.

He told MPs: ‘The concern that we certainly have is that however many safeguards there are on the ability to simply take money from somebody’s bank account, it does rely on the authority having worked out how much money should correctly be taken from it in the first place.

‘It may mean over a period of time particularly more vulnerable people – people who are not wealthy, high earners – may become subject to this.’

The experts’ comments have added to a growing chorus of concern over the controversial move.

Britain is being robbed of around £35billion a year by cheats who fail to pay their taxes and others who find ways of avoiding them, according to HMRC.

Under the proposals, which will be subject to a consultation, HMRC will be able to take all the money that a person owes in tax out of their bank account, subject to two key rules.

It cannot take the full amount unless the person would have at least £5,000 left across all bank accounts after the tax debt has been paid and the money can only be taken if HMRC has contacted the person at least three times about the unpaid tax bill.

HMRC estimates around 17,000 people a year will be hit by the new rules and each of them will typically owe around £5,800. But Andrew Tyrie MP, who chairs the Commons Treasury Committee, has previously said members of the committee were ‘concerned’ about the move.

Liberal Democrat MP John Thurso, who sits on the committee, has said: ‘The victims will be people with just enough money to go after but not enough to hire lawyers to fend it off.’

He said any such ‘advance of powers by the state’ should be ‘resisted unless they can justify it’. Mr  Stevens has previously said: ‘There are lots of very unsophisticated people out there with more than £5,000 in a bank account. We are truly worried about the vulnerable.’

Mr Haskew said the new law could trigger ‘perverse effects’, such as people keeping their money in cash, rather than in a bank account, so HMRC cannot get its hands on the money.

In the Budget documents, the Treasury insists HMRC’s new debt collection powers ‘bring the UK in line with many other tax authorities which already have the power to recover debts directly from an individual’s account, such as France and America’.

An HMRC spokesman said: ‘Most people pay their taxes on time, but a minority do not, and some refuse to engage with us at all.

‘It is wrong that this should hand an advantage to those who simply dodge their obligations and is unfair on the vast majority who pay their taxes in full and on time.

‘We will shortly be consulting on a new measure with appropriate safeguards to help level the playing field, and tackle those who have the means to pay but are choosing not to.

‘This will only affect a tiny number of debtors.’

Overall, HMRC estimates around half of the people who it will be targeting have more than £20,000 in their bank accounts, but are still refusing to pay their tax bill.
