A father and his two young boys have been found alive and well after spending up to ten days in their trapped car.

Stephen Van Lonkhuyzen, 37, and his boys Ethan, 7, and Timothy, 5, were found in their 'severely bogged' four-wheel drive at Expedition National Park in central Queensland by a local property owner at about 3:30pm on Sunday.

'He [the property owner] was checking his cattle on a piece of land that he owns and he remembered seeing the media and a vehicle similar to that description,' Detective Acting Superintendent Owen Elloy said.

'He thought, while he was down in that part of his property, that he'd shoot across and check an area that people had camped in before, and lo and behold.'

They were found at Expedition National Park (pictured) in central Queensland where their car had become 'severely bogged'

Aside from being found 'extremely hungry'  by the man, who is from a remote area known as The Tin Hut, Detective Elloy said Mr Van Lonkhuyzen and his children were found 'alive and well'.

Police  arrived at the scene just after 5pm and are expected to winch the car out of its position before taking the trio to their Lota home in Brisbane's east.

'It is a piece of land that is normally visited by cattle from what I can understand of it. It is black soil country, it's very soft,' Detective Elloy said.

'It may well be the case that they [police and the family] can't get out during the course of the night. The family will stay with the property owner overnight.'

Mr Van Lonkhuyzen and his boys vanished after starting out on a 1700km Christmas holiday road trip from Brisbane to Cairns, with their last known location being Taroom

Detective Elloy also added: 'They had the common sense to stay with their vehicle which is a huge point in any survival technique. They've stayed with their car and it's a lot easier to find a car than somebody walking.'

He noted that the area was well known for its rugged terrain and deep gorges, saying, 'even the property owner went in there with a huge air of concern – he had his satellite phone with him, thank god.'

They were expected to arrive in Cairns on December 15, but after Mr Van Lonkhuyzon failed to make contact with family or friends in over a week, his wife  contacted police.

The trio were last seen at a petrol station at Miles, northwest of Toowoomba, on December 11.

Detective Acting Superintendent Owen Elloy noted that the area in which the trio were found was well known for its rugged terrain and deep gorges, saying that even the property owner that found them 'went in there with a huge air of concern – he had his satellite phone with him, thank god'

Mr Lonkhuyzen last contacted his wife at Taroom on December 11 after he and his sons travelled inland to do some sightseeing.

A massive search was launched across a huge area of outback Queensland before the trio were found.

'We have had police, including those from Miles, Wondoan and Taroom, patrol hundreds of kilometres of outback roads, as well as camp grounds and truck stops,' Detective Elloy said.

'This is a vast geographical area that we are talking about and many roads are cut due to localised flooding or swollen creeks.'
