Hull have released centre Ben Crooks to enable him to take up a contract with NRL side Parramatta.

The 21-year-old was named in the Super League Dream Team just 12 months ago after a sensational first full season in the top flight but he struggled to maintain his form this year and spent the second half of the season playing on a dual-registration with Doncaster.

Crooks had a year left on his contract but sought a release so that he could follow in the footsteps of his father Lee, who had a successful spell in Australia with Western Suburbs and Balmain in the 1980s.

Hull say they will retain the player's Super League registration in case he returns to England.

A Hull spokesman said: 'The club feel the circumstances are right for Ben to pursue this significant lifestyle and career move in a new country, particularly following recent recruitment activity.

'He leaves with the best wishes of everyone at the club.'

Hull have been impressed with the form of centre Setaimata Sa since he joined them in mid-season and they recently announced the signing of former Gold Coast Titans threequarter Steve Michaels.

Coach Lee Radford says he is hopeful of having two more new signings finalised within the next fortnight, with one of them expected to be former Bradford full-back Curtis Naughton, who spent this year with Sydney Roosters' reserves.
