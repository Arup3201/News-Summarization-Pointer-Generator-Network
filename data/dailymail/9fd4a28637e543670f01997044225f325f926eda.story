Banks are still 'too big to fail' six years after lenders caused a financial 
meltdown that led to the recession, according to regulators who called 
the the institutions' plans to avoid future bailouts 
'unrealistic.'

The declaration leaves open the possibility for harsh punishments.

The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation criticized 11 financial institutions Tuesday morning over plans they have submitted that detail how each institution would resolve their financial obligations and wind down operations in the event of a bankruptcy.

Deficient: Regulators attacked plans by 11 of the largest financial institutions as not 'credible,' leaving open the possibility of sanctions

Harsh criticism: FDIC Vice Chair Thomas Hoenig ripped into the banks' living wills as being 'deficient' for failing to plan realistically without the aid of taxpayers

The creation of living wills was imposed on large banks in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when some of the largest banks required government bailouts in order to stave off a chain of bankruptcies that would have crippled the global financial system.

The New York Times reports that the FDIC and the Fed sent letters to Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and eight other banks critical of the plans that were submitted in 2013.

Some of these contingency plans are tens of thousands of pages long, yet the FDIC blasted them as 'deficient' and unable to bring a bank into bankruptcy 'without precipitating a financial crisis.'

“The plans provide no credible or clear path through bankruptcy that doesn’t require unrealistic assumptions and direct or indirect public support,” FDIC Vice Chair Thomas Hoenig said in a statement.

The Financial Times reports that the FDIC's remark that living wills are not 'credible' might open up the largest banks to significant intervention by government regulators.

However, the Fed's language was more conciliatory, urging banks to remedy the 'shortcomings' of their living will plans before the Fed joined the FDIC in calling the plans not credible.

The possible punishments banks face are 'more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements' or even being forced by regulators to sell off investments to unaffiliated institutions.

Regulators recently came under fire from Congress when Senator Elizabeth Warren lit into Fed Chair Janet Yellen last month.

The Massachusetts senator has been critical of big banks before, and during a lively hearing televised on C-Span went after the Fed failing to get a workable living will out of JPMorgan Chase.

'Have they ever gotten to a plan that you can say with a straight face is credible?' demanded Warren.

'I've understood this to be a process, these are extremely complex documents to produce,' Yellen responded.

As the Huffington Post points out, Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew admitted in 2013 that the US had not done enough to eliminate the threat of financial institutions being so big that a bankruptcy could trigger another panic in the global financial markets.

Speaking at the Pew Charitable Trusts at the end of the year, Lew said Wall Street reform needed to balance 'maintaining deep, liquid financial markets that promote strong credit creation and lending, and protecting our economy and the American taxpayer from excessive risk-taking.'

President Obama has previously touted living wills as proof that Wall Street could no longer 'play by its own set of rules' according to the Chicago Tribune.

Nine financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, submitted living wills in 2012, none were deemed 'not credible' at the time.

Congress earlier blamed the Fed for not being strict enough with JPMorgan Chase's living will
