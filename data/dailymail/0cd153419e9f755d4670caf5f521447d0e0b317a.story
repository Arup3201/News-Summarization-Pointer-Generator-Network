The police force under fire for its role in changing evidence from the Hillsborough disaster is today under pressure over its role in prosecutions made during the 1984 Miners' Strike.

South Yorkshire Police is facing calls for an inquiry into allegations some police colluded in writing statements after the infamous violence between officers and pickets at the Orgreave coking plant.

Lawyers claim there was ‘widespread collusion’ between officers five years before the Hillsborough tragedy when 96 Liverpool fans died and statements were altered to remove criticism of police.

South Yorkshire police face claims officers used the same phrases in dozens of witness statements from the Battle of Orgreave between officers and miners in 1984

The Hillsborough Independent Panel report, chaired by the Bishop of Liverpool, claimed 164 police statements were altered in the wake of the tragedy.

Tonight a BBC documentary will reveal allegations that officers from the same force colluded in compiling evidence from the so-called Battle of Orgreave in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.

More than 90 people were arrested in one of the most famous clashes of the year-long miners’ strike.

The Inside Out Yorkshire and Lincolnshire programme claims to have obtained copies of around 100 police witness statements which it is claimed show the extent to which officers used identical phrases to describe what they had seen.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission is expected to be asked to look at the claims, which could undermine convictions of those arrested.

Chris Kitchen, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, said: ‘Many miners were subjected to malpractice during the strike by South Yorkshire police – and other forces.

‘I will be asking the NUM's national executive committee to consider complaining to the IPCC and DPP for the police operations at Orgreave and elsewhere during the strike to be investigated, now the details of what South Yorkshire police did at Hillsborough have been revealed,’ he told The Guardian.

Former Labour MP Vera Baird QC, who represented Orgreave miners in court, said she was 'frankly shocked' by the 'deliberate nature' of putting together this case against those involved in the clashes

Former Labour MP Vera Baird QC, who represented Orgreave miners in court, said: ‘I was frankly shocked by Orgreave by the deliberate nature of putting together this case.’

Barrister Mark George QC carried out analysis of dozens of documents. He found that 34 officers' statements, used the identical phrase:

‘Periodically there was missile throwing from the back of the pickets.’

Some 22 statements used the same paragraph, of four full sentences, including the phrase: ‘There was however a continual barrage of missiles.’

Mr George told the BBC: ‘It's very obvious in the Orgreave case that there was widespread collusion.’

Mounted police moved in on striking miners picketing at Orgreave coking plant, near Sheffield when 90 people were arrested

Asked about the Inside Out programme, a South Yorkshire Police spokeswoman said: ‘South Yorkshire Police notes the issues raised in the programme and will consider whether any review is necessary.

‘The force is not aware of any adverse comment about the statements from the trial judge in the case.

‘If concerns existed then normal practice would have been for the judge to raise them at the time.’

However, the claims will add to the pressure on the force, coming just weeks after revelations about its handling of the Hillsborough tragedy.

The independent panel last month revealed 116 statements had negative comments about the policing of the football match removed or changed.

Last week, the current South Yorkshire chief constable, David Crompton, told MPs his force would take just two weeks to give the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) the names and addresses of up to 1,000 officers who were on duty on the day of the Hillsborough disaster.
