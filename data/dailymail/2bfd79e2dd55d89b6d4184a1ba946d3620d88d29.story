The attorney for a Dallas Cowboy player on trial for a fatal drink-driving accident has argued that the player's size means he is less affected by alcohol.Â 

Josh Brent was more than twice the legal limit for alcohol when he crashed his Mercedes in December 2012, killing his friend and teammate Jerry Brown.

The 25-year-old failed a roadside sobriety test but his attorney George Milner has argued that at 6ft 2in and 320lb Brent could safely drink more than other people.

Brent, a former defensive tackle, could face 20 years in prison if found guilty of intoxication manslaughter. He had been friends with his passenger and victim, Mr Brown, since they were students at University of Illinois.

On the opening day of the trial yesterday, the court heard Brent's blood-alcohol level was 0.189 per cent. The legal limit in Texas is 0.08.

Police video shows Brent failing a roadside sobriety test, where he was unable to recite the alphabet, and he allegedly told officers he 'had a buzz going on', ABC News reported.

Bar receipts showed that on December 8, the night of the crash, Brent had bought several cocktails and three bottles of champagne, prosecutors said.

'This is not a difficult case, ladies 
and gentlemen. There will be no 
disputing the fact that he was drinking that night,' prosecutor Heath Harris said.

But Brent's attorney has argued that because of his size, Brent can safely drink more than others.

'Josh Brent is as big as a house. He was guilty of being stupid and driving too fast, but he was not drunk,' Mr Milner said.

A University of Florida toxicologist, who is not part of the trial, has cast doubt on the defense. Bruce Goldberger told ABC News: 'One's
 impairment has absolutely nothing to do with their size and weight and 
height.'

Fatal: Josh Brent's Mercedes flipped over and landed on its roof in the December 2012 crash

When police arrived at the crash scene, in which Brent's Mercedes has flipped over, he told officers he'd had 'a reasonable amount' to drink, Dallas News reported.

When he was asked to walk in a straight line he wobbled, and he missed out a few letters when asked to say the alphabet, the court was told.

But Mr Milner has argued that Brent's ability to perform the roadside sobriety test was impaired because he had just been in a high-speed crash.

Brent, who has left the Cowboys, is also facing charges of driving with an expired and suspended license. He has pleaded not guilty.
