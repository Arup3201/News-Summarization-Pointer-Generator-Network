Breast cancer sufferers are to be denied a new 'wonder' drug that has been proven to extend life by six months.

Rationing watchdog NICE is set to block routine use of the medicine on the NHS for those with the most aggressive form of the disease on the grounds of cost.

Known as Kadcyla or T-DM1, it is the first treatment that can destroy cancerous cells while sparing healthy tissue.

As a result, it dramatically reduces the traumatic side-effects usually associated with chemotherapy, including hair loss.

Up to 1,500 women a year in Britain with advanced HER-2 positive breast cancer could benefit.

The medicine, which costs £6,000 a month, will be the eighth breast cancer treatment turned down by NICE because of cost since 2011.

It says the £90,000 bill for treating a patient over 15 months is simply too great.

NICE's decision was attacked by a cancer sufferer who claims it has extended her life by more than two years. Kim Mawby, 44, who was given six months to live in 2011, said she is now living a normal life with her partner and two sons, taking holidays and working part time.

'It's a wonder drug as far as I'm concerned,' she said. 'You wouldn't know that I am ill. I'm devastated to think that women in my position might be denied it in future.'

Kadcyla combines Herceptin, another breast cancer drug, with a potent chemotherapy agent which acts only when it reaches cancer cells. It blocks signals that encourage the cancer to spread, and breaches the tumour's outer defences, allowing it to be destroyed from within.

Because its action is so precise, healthy tissue is spared from unnecessary damage, while the cancer is delayed from returning and side-effects are significantly reduced.  Trial results show it provides on average six months' extra life, but some women having once-monthly infusions are living far longer.

Professor Paul Ellis, professor of cancer medicine at King's College London and lead triallist for the drug in the UK, said the NICE draft guidance was a 'huge blow' because it could revolutionise cancer care. 'For the first time in 20 years as a consultant I'm seeing people with advanced disease taking an effective drug with little toxicity,' he said.

NICE is currently consulting  on draft guidance recommending the drug is not transferred to the  NHS budget.

Whatever the outcome, patients in England can apply to get it from the Cancer Drugs Fund, set up to fund medicines not routinely available on the NHS.

But the fund does not operate elsewhere in the UK, and it is due to be wound up in 2016.

Dr Caitlin Palframan, of charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: 'The drug appraisal process in England, and the cost of drugs, must change if prospects for patients are going to improve.'

Sir Andrew Dillon, NICE chief executive, said he hoped Roche, which makes the drug, would use the consultation period to consider if there was more it could do.

He said: 'We had hoped Roche would have recognised the challenge the NHS faces in managing the adoption of expensive new treatments by reducing the cost of Kadcyla to the NHS.'
