Kane my man of the year 

If you stopped the season right now, there would be four players in contention for player of the year: Cesc Fabregas for the purists, Diego Costa for his power, Alexis Sanchez for his impact and Harry Kane for his all-round game.

For me, it would have to be Harry Kane.

But it’s time to forget the story around him. Yes, he is a homegrown star, Tottenham’s first since Ledley King. Yes, he plays like a fan on the pitch. But he is so much more than that now. He is a genuine, top quality talent.

Kane has scored 11 goals in his last 14 Tottenham matches, and four goals in his last two games. He managed just three last season 

It’s hard to spot a weakness in his game. He takes up intelligent positions like his hero Teddy Sheringham. He’s got the strength to hold up the ball and hold off opponents. He can link up with team-mates or take the ball and run with it. He can shoot with either foot, hit them from distance or from close-range and he is outstanding in the air. He takes penalties, free-kicks and he works as hard as anybody on the pitch.

The big question for any young star is, can they do it in the big games? Just ask John Terry and Laurent Koscielny whether Kane can.

Tottenham fans are loving seeing ‘one of their own’ succeed, and there were six young players in Saturday’s starting XI that the club have produced or helped develop.

But it’s Kane whose performances have dragged Spurs into the Champions League contention. That’s why he’s my player of the season so far.

City not so slick 

Can Man City really be happy with how their season is going? Off the pace in the title race, just about in the Champions League and out of the FA Cup. For the squad they have, it’s not good enough. Yes, they have missed Yaya Toure, but at the start of the season people were ready to drop him. City’s home form is far poorer than this time last year and they need a shift in mentality because they have to be switched on in every game.

Ibe is one for the future

I spoke to Steven Gerrard before his final Merseyside derby and he listed some of the most talented names at Liverpool. On that list was Jordon Ibe. After his performance at Goodison Park, you can see why.

In what was a rather poor derby game, Ibe’s display was a bright spot. He was quick, sharp and desperately unlucky not to score. The shot he hit against the post was so pure that the ball barely moved in flight.

Gerrard said Ibe has a bit of Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling in him and that he could be one for England in the future. That’s high praise indeed, though if Ibe’s career continues to blossom, I’m sure he won’t be playing as a wing back for much longer.

Super Simeone gets results

Away from the Premier League, we had one of the results of the season in La Liga. Atletico Madrid didn’t just beat their city rivals Real, they completely thrashed them.

It’s not often you see Real Madrid on the end of 4-0 scoreline, but Diego Simeone has created an incredible work ethic within his squad. They all work unbelievably hard for each other and play right on the limit of the rules, but that is how Simeone likes his teams.

He barks and snarls on the touchline and creates a frenzied atmosphere, and his players are desperate to please him — they even sprint when they are subbed off.

It’s like Simeone has them all on a remote control. It’s a unique style and I doubt it would work with a group of superstars, but it certainly gets results with Atletico.

Chelsea have the ultimate warrior

Branislav Ivanovic has been a bit of a Chelsea hero recently. He scored the winner against Liverpool in that cup semi-final and ended the game with a boot full of blood. 

Then he hits a stunner with his left at Aston Villa to send Chelsea seven points clear. I think his left foot can be a bit of a swinger, but it did the business on Saturday.

He’s not far off the Premier League’s top five goal-scoring defenders and when you consider how many games he’s played, and that he doesn’t take set pieces or penalties, it’s an impressive record.

Wayne wasted in midfield role

I keep hearing Wayne Rooney can do a job in midfield and that Louis van Gaal can turn him into the new Paul Scholes. Rubbish.

Wayne Rooney is a centre forward. That is his best position. Nobody will convince me otherwise.

He is United’s best attacker and he should be up front affecting games. He has the ability to play in midfield, but that can happen in a few years’ time. Roy Hodgson won’t be picking Wayne in midfield for England any time soon.

I think Van Gaal is taking the easy way out so he can play Robin van Persie and Falcao up front and not upset anyone. But Wayne can’t be enjoying it.

It’s easy for him to stroll around and ping passes but he should be banging in goals every week, not wasting his ability in midfield.

Don't write off my Dad yet...

When my dad announced he was leaving QPR so he could have surgery, a lot of people assumed that was it for him. 

At 67 and after nine clubs as a player and manager, surely it was time to retire. Don’t count on it. 

Why? My dad is football mad. It’s all he’s ever known and when you have it in your blood it’s hard to let go. His timing has always been bad but he loves the stress of management, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see him back. Mum will be glad to have him out of the house, too!

Jamie's Premier League number crunching

7 - Everton are having a hard time finding the net at the moment, and have scored just seven goals in their last 10 Premier League matches - just two this year! When you consider they didn’t manage a single shot on target against Liverpool until the 87th minute, it’s not hard to see why. It’s not all bad news though - they have kept three PL clean sheets for the first time since November 2013.

131 - After Saturday’s match, there have now been 131 PL goals scored in Tottenham v Arsenal matches - no other fixture has seen as many.

1 - Tottenham have lost just one of their last seven Premier League home games against north London rivals Arsenal (Won 4, Drawn 2, Lost 1).

1999 - Every goal scored in the match between Burnley and West Brom was headed — the first time all goals in a game of four or more were scored in this fashion since September 1999 (Wimbledon v Derby County).

12 - Spurs have won 12 points from goals scored in the final five minutes of PL games this season - twice as many as any other side.

36 - After finding the net against Swansea, Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe has scored at least one league goal against every current Premier League side.

4 - Manchester City have gone four Premier League games without a win for the first time since November 2009. On the plus side, however, James Milner ended a 36-game run without a Premier League goal on Saturday.
