Dutch midfielder Leroy Fer has completed his move to QPR from Championship side Norwich.

The 24-year-old, who has joined for £7million, has signed a three-year contract with Harry Redknapp's side.

Fer spent just one season at Carrow Road after joining the Canaries from Eredivisie side FC Twente last summer.

He becomes Redknapp's fifth summer signing following the arrivals of Jordon Mutch, Rio Ferdinand, Mauricio Isla and Steven Caulker.

'I can't wait to get started here. It was always my dream to stay in England, in the Premier League. QPR did well last season to come up and the squad is full of top players, so I'm delighted to be here,' Fer told qpr.co.uk.

'Harry told me I was a big target for him and when you hear that from a coach, you want to work with them and play for them.

'I'm just looking forward to showing what I'm capable of here at QPR.'

Redknapp, who watched his side suffer a 1-0 defeat to Hull in their opening game of the season, said: 'Leroy's arrival is a massive boost for us.

'He's another excellent signing and I'm delighted we've been able to get him to QPR.

'He played for Holland in the World Cup this summer and has all the attributes you'd be looking for from a central midfielder.

'He's just an outstanding midfield player - great physique, fine ability, he gets box-to-box.

'I'm really looking forward to integrating him into the squad.'
