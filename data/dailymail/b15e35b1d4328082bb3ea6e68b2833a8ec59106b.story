The father of a woman who was fatally shot by her husband in 2009 was heckled by pro-gun protesters - one of whom was eventually Tasered by police - at a rally outside of the New Hampshire statehouse on Tuesday, which has added new fuel to the fire in the already torrid debate over gun control.

John Cantin, whose daughter Melisa was fatally shot by her estranged husband when she was just 29 years old, was speaking at a rally for stricter gun control measures, including additional background checks for people purchasing firearms.

In the middle of his speech, a man - later identified by police as Daniel Musso - started harassing him.

Below is a transcript of some of the exchange, as captured in a video posted on Youtube:

CANTIN: We know that when there is a gun in the home of a domestic abuser, a woman is 500 times more likely to be killed—

MUSSO: What kind of gun are you talking here?

CANTIN: And we know in states where there are background checks—

MUSSO: A pellet gun? Or a machine gun? What kind of guns?

CANTIN: All kinds of guns.

MUSSO: Well, it doesn’t say that in your speech.

Musso and his pro-gun cohorts went on to call Cantin's speech nothing but propaganda, to which Cantin replied, 'what happened to my daughter wasn't propaganda,' during an interview with CNN's Martin Bashir this afternoon.

Shut up! Daniel Musso argues with police before being arrested for disorderly conduct and assault

Melisa Cantin Charbonneau - a 29-year-old mother and nurse - was murdered by her estranged husband, Jonathan Charbonneau, in October of 2009, just days after he was arrested for throwing her down a flight of stairs and strangling her

The day Jonathan Charbonneau shot his wife, he was out of jail on $30 bail for the previous misdemeanor assault.

In addition to murdering his wife, Jonathan Charbonneau shot her father, John, and killed himself.

John Cantin survived the attack and then spent years lobbying for stricter domestic violence laws, arguing that if his former son-in-law hadn't been out on bail after assaulting Melisa Cantin, she might still be alive.

'I don't believe this bill will stop the person doing the choking, but at least when it does happen and they are arrested, they are put away,' Cantin said in a 2010 interview with USA Today.

He's since shifted his lobbying efforts to include advocating for stricter gun-control laws.

Senator Kelly Ayotte issued a statement saying she 'hopes that everyone would be civil at all events no matter what their viewpoint is'

Many of the pro-gun advocates who showed up at Tuesday's rally are supporters of Republican New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte, who in April voted against a bill that would have expanded background checks to include people who buy guns online and at gun shows.

While 40 other Republicans and five Democrats opposed the bill, New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg's pro-gun-control organization, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, has specifically targeted Ayotte by spending more than $400,000 on an ad campaign in her home state claiming she opposes background checks for gun-buyers.

'I supported legislation that would have improved our background check system,' Ayotte told the Washington Times last month. 'These are clearly out-of-state interests coming into New Hampshire spending a lot of money, and I think at the end of the day people will sort through these types of false attacks, they will examine the issue, and I trust the people of New Hampshire to make their own judgments.'

Bloomberg's attack on Ayotte has only increased her fanfare amongst pro-gun advocates, many of whom started chanting her name as Musso harassed Cantin at Tuesday's rally.

'While Senator Ayotte wasn’t there, she hopes that everyone would be civil at all events no matter what their viewpoint is,' Ayotte spokesman Jeff Grappone said in a statement to the website BuzzFeed.

According to the local Patch.com, Musso was later Tasered by police and arrested after an altercation with officers who were summoned by gun-control advocates to monitor the situation.

Musso has been charged with one count each of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and two counts of simple assault, 
allegedly against a rally attendee and a police 
officer. He was held on $5,000 cash bail
