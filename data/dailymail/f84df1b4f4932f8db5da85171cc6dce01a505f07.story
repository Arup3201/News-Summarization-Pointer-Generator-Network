Tag A Cat lets users find potential cat-loving contacts in their area by viewing photos of their pets' selfies and snaps of them sleeping.

Just like Facebook and Instagram, owners can follow their favourite cats' feeds, comment on posts and make friends with the felines.

Tag A Cat is 'for people who can’t get enough of cats' and want to befriend local felines

Furry online personalities such as Grumpy Cat, who has more than 30,000 Twitter followers and 6.7 million likes on Facebook, are immensely popular.

Hundreds of cat owners, including celebrities such as Karl Lagerfeld, are creating social media profiles for their beloved pets.

So it's no surprise that the world's obsession with cats has spawned Tag A Cat, a separate social network just for them. 

A  spokesman said: 'Tag A Cat is for people who can’t get enough of cats, and want to share their own cat pics with like minded people.

'It offers a simple and intuitive user interfaces that can help people to create their own feed of new cat pics.'

The launch of Tag A Cat, which is free to download from the iTunes store, comes after the success of other sites such as Catmoji. 

The launch of Tag A Cat could also put a stop the endless stream of text messages clogging your phone with pictures of family and friends' sleeping cats or new kittens

The quirky app allows users to browse cat pictures by emotion, such as sad or surprised. 

My Social Petwork has also taken off, letting owners connect their pet profiles with other fun-looking cats, dogs rabbits and even snakes. 

The site's research showed that 20 per cent of our online pictures are dominated by our pets so created a site dedicated to cute pictures of pets napping, eating and looking confused.
