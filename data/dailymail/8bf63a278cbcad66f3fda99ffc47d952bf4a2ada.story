Saido Berahino is the leading English goalscorer in this season's Premier League – a remarkable story for the boy from Burundi who escaped to this country at the age of 10 to avoid a bloody civil war.

Berahino scored his sixth goal of the season, fifth in the league, with a well-struck penalty that he earned in West Brom's 2-1 defeat against Liverpool at Anfield and manager Alan Irvine – who coached a young Wayne Rooney – knows he has another special talent on his hands.

'Everyone is talking about Saido and understandably so,' said Irvine. 'He is very professional in the way he works and I have no doubt he will improve because of that.

'I thought he was a handful all afternoon. He worked the centre-halves and for a young player his movement is very good.

'From where I was standing, I couldn't be sure if it was a penalty or not. But having been given it, for Saido to step up and taki it with such conviction was great.

'He practises and got the benefit of all that practise.

'He missed a chance in the first half and of course his finishing still needs to be a little bit more clinical but he will get there because of the work he does, even after every training session.'

Berahino, a member of Gareth Southgate's England under-21 squad, seized upon Javier Manquillo's loose ball to have Albion's best chance of the first half, with his shot parried away by Simon Mignolet.

But when Dejan Lovren tripped him on the edge of the box – replays showed it was just outside – referee Michael Oliver pointed to the spot and Berahino confidently despatched his penalty to Mignolet's right while the Belgian dived to the left.

Berahino has stated it is his target to make the full England squad this season and he certainly looked livelier than Liverpool's Rickie Lambert, who has been picked by Roy Hodgson for the forthcoming qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia as one of only three strikers alongside Danny Welbeck and Wayne Rooney.
