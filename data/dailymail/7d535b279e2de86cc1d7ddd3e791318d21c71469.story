Stocks slid to the lowest value in two months today and technology stocks plummeted after Apple withdrew an update to its operating system.

Each of the major indexes fell more than one per cent and the S&P broke below a key support level amid fears of uncertainty surrounding the global economy. 

And the Dow slumped 1.5 per cent - just days after closing at an all time high following the debut of Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba on the market. 

Problems: Apple shares plummeted as iPhone 6 users continue to report problems such as handsets bending

Apple shares were the biggest drag on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes, as consumers continue to report problems with the iPhone 6 - pushing shares down three per cent to $98.69.

The firm has faced backlash after it emerged the long-awaited handset is bendable.  

As a result, the biggest casualties on the stock market were seen in the tech-packed Nasdaq compsite, which ended down 1.9 per cent and the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which dropped 1.6 per cent.

Each of the ten major S&P sectors was in negative territory.

The Dow Jones industrial average was falling 229.76 points, or 1.34 per cent, to 16,980.3, the S&P 500 was losing 26.93 points, or 1.35 per cent, to 1,971.37 and the Nasdaq Composite was dropping 75.32 points, or 1.65 per cent, to 4,479.91.

All of the major indexes were on track for their worst drop since July 31.

The S&P 500 also broke through its 50-day moving average around 1,976, a key support level which the index had been able to rebound off of when recently tested.

Adding to concerns for investors was the continued strength of the dollar and the possible impact on corporate earnings.  

'I don't get too worried about dollar strength. Of course, the hard part is this is kind of a historic sized move here, so certainly individual companies have to worry perhaps about the impact,' said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia.

'It's pretty easy to say you should expect that to roll through some of the earnings reports to some extent, because you don't often see those kind of moves.'

Durable goods orders dropped 18.2 per cent in August, however this had little effect as it was largely in-line with expectations. 

Last week saw an optimistic turn as initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 293,000 for the week ended September 20, which was well below the 300,000 forecast, indicating an acceleration in job growth for the month. 

The largest percentage gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was Cone Midstream Partners, rising 35.45 percent, while the largest percentage decliner was OMNOVA Solutions, down 15.70 percent.

Declining issues were outnumbering advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,530 to 477, for a 5.30-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,153 issues were falling and 494 advancing for a 4.36-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

The benchmark S&P 500 index was posting 6 new 52-week highs and 9 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 18 new highs and 140 new lows.
