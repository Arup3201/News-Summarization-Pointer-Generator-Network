A father accused of killing a baby girl over Skype by
telling her mother to dunk her head in a bucket of water - has been extradited
to Norway to face trial.

Ammaz Qureshi was talking to his former mistress over the
internet when one-year-old Hunaina started crying, interrupting their
conversation.

He is accused of telling her mother, Yasmin Chaudhry, to
hold her daughter by the ankles and dunk her in the bucket as punishment.

But after her nose and mouth were submerged for the second
time the girl stopped breathing and lost consciousness. She was rushed to
hospital but died the next day. 

Prosecutors say that the dunking was part of a campaign of
cruelty inflicted on the girl by her mother under Qureshi's instructions.

That allegedly included spraying her in the face with a
bottle of water, making her eat chilli powder and forcing her to stay awake.

She was also forced to stay in the ‘naughty corner’ for
hours with her legs bound, sleep on the floor and had her head held under
running water in the sink, they claim.

Following her daughter's death in October 2010, Chaudhry
told doctors that she fell into the water by accident.

She was arrested on suspicion of negligence because of
inconsistencies in the stories she told police and paramedics.

But when facing manslaughter charges, she told police that
Qureshi, 33, of Pinner, North London, had been directing the abuse for months.

He was questioned by Norwegian police in the UK in December
2010 and faces charges of cruelty to a child and manslaughter. He denies giving
any instructions.

The married accountant had a fling with Chaudhry when she
came to London on holiday in February 2010. He managed to keep the death from
his wife until police began to question him.

Police flew over from Oslo to question him with the help of Scotland Yard

He was arrested in June and put on a plane to Norway earlier
this week.

In January this year, Norwegian police prosecutor Kristin
Rusdal told MailOnline: 'This has been a long investigation and she (Chaudhry)
eventually admitted it to us in October 2011.

'She said it was done to discipline the child. She had been
holding her under water.

'She had discussed the discipline with this friend, with
whom she had a relationship.'
