We are starting to plan the next move for Carl Froch and there are exciting times ahead with a number of options on the table. I sat down with James DeGale last week and I am confident he will fight Carl Froch sooner or later.

The question at the moment is when. As you know, he is the mandatory for Carl’s IBF super-middleweight world title and Carl must fight him by the end of February.

Carl’s preferred option is Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas in November or December, but I don’t think that is going to happen.

In line? DeGale is the mandatory for Carl¿s IBF super-middleweight world title

The big one: Froch would rather fight Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr (left) in Las Vegas

I have had exploratory conversations with Bob Arum who would like the fight to happen in October so we will see how that plays out.

That leaves DeGale and Mikkel Kessler as the realistic options for the end of 2014. Kessler III would be a great fight but we also know the value of a big domestic dust up. Carl is just back from a well-deserved family holiday and is in training for the BBC 1 show ‘Tumble’. The media requests are still coming thick and fast - surely he is a front runner for the Sports Personality award.

At this point in his career, he has to select the fight that makes the blood pump and gets you out of bed at the crack of dawn for those tough hill runs. Money as always will be a factor but Carl more than most is driven by the competition and his desire to leave a legacy in the sport.

I think DeGale would be a huge fight. It is a domestic fight between a legend of the sport and an Olympic champion who is looking to make history and become the first British gold medalist to go on and win a world title. I think that a fight with Carl and James could be made either this winter, in November or December, or possibly in the Spring. As I said, it is all in Carl’s court but what I do know about him is that he will not willingly vacate a title. He worked hard for his titles, he won’t just give them up.

If a fight with Froch doesn’t happen this winter, I will look to get James DeGale a big fight at the O2 Arena on October 11 but all roads lead to Carl Froch.

I’m a big believer that everything happens for a reason and Callum Smith cruelly missing out on an Olympic place has turned him, in my opinion, into one of the hottest prospects in world boxing. His technique, attitude, skill and power continues to amaze me.

He lost in the final qualification tournament in Turkey in a poor decision in a semi-final fight that would have sealed it. A terrible decision. But look what he is doing in the professional ranks now. I am convinced he is going to go on to become one of Britain’s great world champions

People say I overhype him or put too much expectation on him. For a start I know he can handle it. And also I know how special this guy is.

He fights again on my July 12 bill in Liverpool in a WBC International super-middleweight title fight and I have a blueprint in mind for getting him to the top.

I have never doubted that he can do it. My dad watched his debut fight and afterwards he said to me that he had never seen a debut like it.

After 11 professional fights and nine knockouts I already think he could handle himself against the world champions at super-middleweight. I’ve seen him spar Carl Froch and many others - the kid is a class act.

He is a beast at the weight – his back is huge – and one day I am sure he will be a light-heavyweight world champion as well.

Before that, he has to come through his fight against Valdine Biosse in Liverpool and then I will continue to move up the World rankings in September or October. Realistically, I believe he is 12 to 18 months from a world title shot.

His progress warrants that kind of plan but he has to keep winning.

He has reached this title level even quicker than Anthony Joshua and Luke Campbell, who are both blasting their way through. But Callum has already reached 11 fights, is charging up the rankings and the WBC love him.

The building process starts now. Too many quality fighters are promoted poorly on the way up and when they get there, they don’t get the chance to capitalise on it financially. I want him to not only have big fights but fight for millions. He is good enough, exciting enough and has real pay-per-view potential.  

 

Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew also have fights on July 12. Neither man can afford a slip up on the night as their rematch later in the year will be a classic.

The fingers will be crossed this Saturday hoping they come through against two big bangers and then we can start planning for a huge domestic clash.

The warm-up: Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew also have fights on July 12... and neither can slip up

 

I’m in the process of drawing up a plan for Ricky Burns after his defeat in a WBC world title eliminator against Dejan Zlaticanin. It was a devastating loss and I know Ricky is gutted.

One thing I can say with certainty is that no-one is giving up on Ricky. He proved his commitment by coming south of the border to prepare and he is as hungry as any fighter.

But we will have to review some things, such as whether he is comfortable at the weight. He is having a holiday at the moment but when he is back I will take him to see our nutritionist and we will see if it is time for him to move from lightweight to light-welterweight.

Go again: Nobody is giving up on Scotsman Burns, despite some devastating defeats

I have seen him spar at 10st 3lbs and look absolutely ferocious. Then, when he comes down to 9st 9lbs he looks a little too frail. That is definitely something we will look at it.

Next up I will put him out on September 13 in Manchester in an eight or 10-round contest. We are going to rebuild his confidence and down the line we will consider where we go.

It looks like Scott Harrison might be getting his licence back - that’s a fight Scotland would embrace!

 

After all the waiting we have a date and venue for Kell Brook’s world title shot against Shawn Porter. He will fight on August 16 at the StubHub Center in Carson, California. It’s a great venue for Kell to finally win the world title he has been working so hard for. He is ready.
