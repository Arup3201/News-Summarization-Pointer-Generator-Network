Southampton are showing interest in FC Twente midfielder Dusan Tadic.

The 25-year-old is valued at £10m by the Dutch side and has attracted offers from Everton and Liverpool over recent months.

Manager Ronald Koeman wants him as a possible replacement for Liverpool-target Adam Lallana and Gaston Ramirez, who is also expected to leave.
