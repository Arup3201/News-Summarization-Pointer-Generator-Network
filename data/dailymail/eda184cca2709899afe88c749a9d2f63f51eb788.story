Downton Abbey will dramatise Edward VIII's first love affair with a married woman, five years before he met Wallis Simpson as part of the programme's Christmas special.

The future King's affair with socialite Freda Dudley Ward has been written into a storyline, which sees Downton character Lady Rose presented at Buckingham Palace for her coming out.

During the episode Lady Rose, played by Lily James, is seen dancing in the arms of Prince Edward, who later became Edward VIII before abdicating to marry divorcee Wallis Simpson.

The prince's secret love affair with his first mistress began in 1918 when the couple, who were both 23, met in a doorway in Mayfair, London, as they sheltered from a First World War Zeppelin Raid.

Mrs Dudley Ward had already been married for five years and had two daughters by her husband, Liberal MP William Dudley Ward, who was 16 years older than her. 

Her husband apparently turned a blind 
eye to the affair, although the relationship was well-known to 
aristocrats and politicians.

Prince Edward would bombard Mrs Dudley Ward her with extravagant gifts, including a gold watch, and wrote letters to his 'precious Fredie Wedie', signing off as 'adoring little David' - the name he went by.

By 1919, the prince wrote he was 'fearfully madly' in love, and 
appears to have introduced her to members of the Royal Family, including
 his brother Bertie, the future King George VI.

Winston Churchill travelled on a train with the couple in 1927 and
 noted: 'It was quite pathetic to see the prince with Freda. His love is
 so obvious and undisguisable.'

However, after 15 years the prince broke off the relationship when he met Mrs Simpson in 1934 and embarked on the romance which led to the abdication crisis two years later.

When the prince met Mrs Simpson, he abruptly severed all ties to his former love. In a call to the Palace in 1934, Mrs Dudley Ward was told
 by an operator: 'I have orders not to put you through.'

Mr and Mrs Dudley Ward divorced in 1931. Her second marriage to Spanish nobleman the Marques de Casa Maury, who she married in October 1937 also ended 
in divorce in 1954. She died in 1983, at 88, and never spoke of the affair.

Mrs Dudley Ward, played by actress Janet Montgomery, follows other historical
 characters to make an appearance on the series, including writer 
Virginia Woolf and soprano Dame Nelly Melba.

Prince Edward will be played by Oliver Dinsdale, while his father King George V, who receives Lady Rose at Buckingham Palace, is portrayed by Guy Williams.

Hollywood stars Shirley MacLaine and Paul Giamatti also return for the two-hour Christmas Day episode, which is set six months after the last series.

ITV have provided little detail about just how the Crawleys will be involved with Mrs Dudley Ward, although a tantalising trailer gives viewers a sneak peak at what is to come.

'When the Crawleys are, implicated in a scandal that threatens to engulf the monarchy, Robert will go to great lengths to protect the Royal family, and his own', the broadcaster said.
