Wakar Akhtar, 21 and his uncle Azad Raja are among four men accused of raping the woman in Bradford

A school teacher was raped by two men on a park bench - after she fell asleep in a mini cab and was taken to a park, a court has heard.

The unconscious woman is alleged to have passed out after drinking at a birthday celebration before she came round to find one of her the men having sex with her.

Now four men are standing trial at Bradford Crown Court accused of conspiracy to rape between May 25 and 26 this year.

Private hire driver Tamseel Virk, 42; Azad Raja, 38, his nephew Wakar Akhtar, 21, and Najeem Ul-Saeed, 31, all of Bradford, West Yorkshire, deny the charge.

Prosecutor Andrew Kershaw told the jury on Monday that Virk picked up the woman from a street in Leeds, in breach of his licence, shortly before midnight on May 25.

Mr Kershaw suggested the fare was not reported to Virk's controller because he had identified a vulnerable woman who could be sexually exploited.

The court heard she was 'noticeably affected' after drinking lager and whisky in a pub with friends.

She was 'talking gibberish' and left her jacket, handbag and phone behind.

Mr Kershaw said Virk 'delivered' her to Akhtar and Raja, getting her to commit a sex act on him on the way.

The jury heard she was dropped off near their home and raped in turn on a bench in Great Horton Park, Bradford, while she was unconscious. 

'They manhandled her, causing bruises and minor injuries to both of her knees, as if she were put in a kneeling position on the ground,' Mr Kershaw said.

She is said to have come round while Raja was having sex with her. Akhtar is alleged to have told her he had already had sex with her.

Mr Kershaw said DNA evidence supported the woman's evidence that sexual activity took place with both men.

He has also alleged that Ul-Saeed then turned up 'too late physically to join in the rape that he had set up'.

'The prosecution case is that there was a conspiracy to rape (the woman) while she was in no fit state either to consent or resist,' Mr Kershaw said.

He continued: 'Akhtar and Raja conspired to rape her because they both agreed to do so; to take delivery of her and rape her together in each other's presence.

'Virk, the prosecution say, is part of the same agreement because he delivered the girl to Akhtar and Raja for them to rape her.

'Virk knew that she was in no fit state to consent or resist because he had been able to abduct her to Great Horton Park, rather than take her home.

'Ul-Saeed is also part of the same agreement because he trafficked her from Virk to Akhtar and arranged where and to whom she was to be delivered; he tried to organise a hotel room and attended at the park to join in but was too late because she had regained consciousness by then.'

Akhtar, pictured, is accused of telling the woman that she had already had sex with him when she came around on a Bradford park bench while she was allegedly being raped by Raja, who also denies the claim

The schoolteacher said she was 'absolutely mortified' to realise she had been raped by two men on a park bench after falling unconscious on a night out.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said it was 'like a massive bad dream' after claiming she had been 'abducted' and taken by a taxi driver to a park bench in Bradford, West Yorkshire, where she was raped by him and his friends. 

Giving evidence at Bradford Crown Court earlier today, the woman said: 'I was absolutely mortified but I just could not deal with it.

'This isn't the way I would behave normally, in the morning it was just like a massive bad dream.

'I'm a decent person and I would never want to do this to anyone. I like to be in control.'

The jury heard that the educated woman, who teaches secondary school students, had gone on a birthday celebration to Leeds, West Yorks., over the May bank holiday earlier this year, with a group of friends.

After becoming heavily intoxicated, she had become separated from friends and made her way to Leeds Station, where she bought herself some fast food.

It was from there that the jury was shown CCTV of her getting into the first of three taxis she hired to get her home, but she claims she doesn't remember anything until she woke up on a park bench in Bradford.

Under cross examination at Bradford Crown Court, pictured,  the woman denied that it was 'sex between consenting adults' claiming that the incident on May 25-26  was 'life-destroying'

Giving evidence from behind a screen, the woman said: 'I just can't believe it. I was on my own and I think I must have just blacked out.

'I like to drink and I like to socialise but in terms of sleeping with men on a park bench, that's totally out of character for me.

'I got back home, went to the top of the stairs and went to bed.'

The following morning, the woman said she woke early and phoned her partner of four years to inform her of the events from the night before.

She said: 'I said to her 'I had sex last night with four Asian men'. I was really, really drunk and needed to get back.

'My elbows were swollen, my chest hurt and my knees were grazed. I felt sick and I was gagging.

'I wasn't going to tell my parents. I was still slightly drunk when I woke up.'

The jury heard that after leaving Leeds, the woman took a taxi to Cookridge, West Yorkshire, but asked to be dropped off in nearby Headingley.

She then got into another taxi and ended up being taken to Great Horton Park in Bradford,  where she alleges the sexual assault took place.

'I felt scared when I was on the park bench,' she said. 'There were these two guys talking in a different language and I thought what is going on?

'I don't know how I got from the pub into the taxi.

'I remember having a conversation with the taxi driver about my bag and my phone as I had lost them.

'It would be out of character for me to bring the conversation round to the subject of sex.

'It's 1000 per cent not in my character to do something like this.'

The court heard the woman made three cash withdrawals on the night, totalling more than £80, as well as spending over £60 on drinks in a Leeds city centre bar.

The woman said: 'I don't recall buying anyone a spirit but I recall buying those £1 shots that you buy in those plastic glasses.

'I can't remember withdrawing the cash. The only thing I remember is thinking I needed to pay the third taxi driver.'

Mr Elyas Singh, defending Akhtar, said: 'I'm going to suggest to you that what happened in Great Horton Park in the early hours of 26 May, Bank Holiday Monday, was not rape in any sense of the word.

'It was sex between consenting adults, all of whom were active, voluntary and an enthusiastic part of what went on.

'I suggest that it was you that in fact instigated the sex and you positively encouraged it. There's no secret or mystery to it.

'Are you crying rape because you regret what happened? Is that what all this was about?'

The woman added: 'This is the most humiliating experience of my life. I knew what this would entail.

'If I wanted it to happen, I would never have mentioned it.

'It was life-destroying. I never expected anything like this to happen to me.'

The trial, which is expected to last ten days, continues. 

All of the men deny all of the charges.
