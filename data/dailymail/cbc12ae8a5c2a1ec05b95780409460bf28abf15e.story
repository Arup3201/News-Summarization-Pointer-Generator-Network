The man identified as the hoaxer who invented Notre Dame superstar Manti Te'o's tragic girlfriend may tell his side of the story, a family member said yesterday.

Peter Navy Tuiasosopo, uncle of Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, says the family plans to hold a meeting this week to determine when and how his nephew would talk about the bizarre prank.

'We want to do it right,' he said, also noting that the family has hired an attorney. He never directly mentioned the hoax or his nephew being involved.

Te'o insisted he had no role in the hoax involving his 'dead' girlfriend and told ESPN on Friday night that he was duped by a person who has since apologized to him.

In an off-camera interview, Te'o identified that person as Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, a 22-year-old acquaintance who lives in California.

He said the young man contacted him soon after Deadspin.com broke the news on Wednesday.

The Deadspin story indicated Ronaiah Tuiasosopo was involved, and suggested Te'o was, too.

'We're just a family of faith. The family is holding up well,' Peter Navy Tuiasosopo said. 'They're holding up the way I would expect a family to. This is a storm.'

He made the comments after attending a two-hour service at the Oasis Christian Church, where his brother, who is Ronaiah's father, is pastor.

'I've been practicing how to say 'no comment' in 20 languages,' the pastor told his congregation. The family has not commented publicly since news of the hoax broke.

Ronaiah Tuiasosopo wasn't seen in attendance, and two church members said he was not there.

Earlier in the day, ABC news announced that Te'o would do his first television interview with Katie Couric.Â 

The interview will air Thursday on 
Couric's daytime talk show and Te'o's parents will be with him. ABC was 
not releasing details of when the interview would take place or where.

Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o will 
have his first on-air interview with Katie Couric on Thursday to talk 
about the alleged hoax of his dead girlfriend.

The highly-anticipated interview will 
technically be the second time that Te'o spoke publicly since the 
scandal broke, but it will be the first time that he does so on 
television.

The standout 
football player gave had an off-camera interview with ESPN on Friday 
night that reportedly lasted for more than two-and-a-half hours, but 
only a short clip from that has been released.

He admitted it was 'crazy' that he had
a purely online relationship with a girl but denied he was part of the 
con to gain publicity for his burgeoning football career at the college.

'No. Never,' Te'o said in an interview Friday night with ESPN's Jeremy Schaap, 'I wasn't faking it. I wasn't part of this.'

The Heisman Trophy runner-up said he 
had an online romance with a woman he never met and in September was 
informed that the woman died from leukemia.

Te'o told ESPN that the person suspected of being the mastermind of the hoax has contacted him and apologized.

Also, in a story published in Sunday's South Bend Tribune, a Notre Dame spokesman said the university decided against disclosing the hoax before the Irish played Alabama in the BCS championship game on January 7 because it wasn't in the best interest of the teams.

University spokesman Dennis Brown said some school administrators thought they should release what they knew about the hoax when they became aware of it.

Te'o went to coaches and school officials with his story on December 26.

The school commissioned an investigation that it says confirmed Te'o was not involved.

Investigators gave their findings to the school on January 4.

The university officials said the investigators did not examine cellphone records, emails or other electronic communication to determine the length or extent of Te'o's communication over the past few years with the person claiming to be Lennay Kekua, nor did the university ask Te'o to take a lie detector test.

The school informed Te'o's parents about the investigation results on January 5.
