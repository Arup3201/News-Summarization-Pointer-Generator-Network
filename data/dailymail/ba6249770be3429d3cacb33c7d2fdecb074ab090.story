Michael Kors can't really be called just a fashion designer anymore. He's a full-fledged lifestyle brand, and that lifestyle is about to add color cosmetics and several new fragrances.

Kors says he's driven by perfection, and that means a total look.

'Beauty is always such an important part of my runway,' he says. 'When we put on a fashion show - after this many years - I've learned the layers and the steps. When I first start thinking mood of the season, beauty is part of it from the start.

'The right dress with the wrong make-up is still wrong,' he adds.

Kors says that while practicality is key when it comes to designing clothes, he trusts his instincts more when it comes to beauty.

'With beauty, it's more of a quick mood check,' he says. 'It's more gut. Immediately, if I smell something and it's evocative, I go with it. What takes so long is the packaging.'

And, he reveals, he had three specific muses for his three new perfumes: Sexy, Sporty and Glam.

'I have a cast of characters that float by
me, sometimes a friend, someone I work with, sometimes celebrity 
clients - all people who have those moods,' he says.

'For sporty, it's Blake 
Lively, can't you see her surfing and putting on a gown? Or Gwyneth 
(Paltrow) with her hair yanked back in a pony?

'For sporty, it's Blake 
Lively. Can't you see her surfing and putting on a gown?'

His sporty woman, he explains, 'could be headed to the red carpet or the gym, but she's the type who just goes.'

As for sexy, Kors says Angelina Jolie and Rihanna personify the attitude.

'They exude confidence,' he says.

'She's not naked, she could be in jeans or a gown, but she's sexy,' he explains.

His final 'muse' is the 'glam' woman, 'who likes to be the center of attention.'

For this, style, he says Jennifer Lopez is his woman.

Center of attention: Kors' 'glam' woman is Jennifer Lopez because sheÂ  'goes big or goes home'

'She's never a wallflower,' he says. 'She goes big or goes home.'

Kors'
runway show is one of the hottest tickets of New York Fashion Week, 
which kicks off next week to preview styles of spring 2014.

Before
that, though, Kors will be recognized by The Couture Council of The 
Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology on Wednesday for his 
contribution in artistry to the industry.
