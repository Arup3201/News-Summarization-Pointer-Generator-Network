A homeless man was rescued after making his bed on top of an 80ft cliff and rolling over the edge in his sleep.

The 33-year-old Romanian immigrant was sleeping rough on a wooded outcrop high above Meadfoot beach in Torquay, Devon, when the accident happened.

Locals were woken up by the sound of his screams after he tumbled over the edge in his sleeping bag, injuring his head, legs and shoulders.

Locals found the man at the bottom of this steep slope with cuts on his head, shoulders and arms

The remote site could not be reached by ambulance so coastguard had to scramble a helicopter

The secluded spot could not be reached by ambulance so coastguards scrambled a helicopter to hoist him back up the cliff.

The homeless man was then flown to hospital where he remains in a stable condition.

Tony Jackson, 71, who lives in a nearby block of nearby apartments, said: 'A few of us had heard shouting from 6am and we all thought it was a drunk.

'Then at about 8.30am three of us went to look and I climbed all the way down.

It took rescuers an hour and a half to hoist the man, who had injuries to his head, shoulders and legs, to safety

Residents from a nearby flat block were woken in the early hours by his screams, and climbed down to him

'He had fallen about 80ft. I think he said he was Romanian. He was showing me his injuries.

'His head was bleeding, his shoulder looked broken, he had a really swollen right hand and his right foot and ankle were all bruised and swollen.

'The coastguard told me to stay with him until the helicopter got there.'

After being hoisted to safety, the man was flown to hospital where he remains in a stable condition

Coastguards from Berry Head and Torbay staged the hour and a half-long rescue, assisted by police and lifeboats from Torbay.

A spokesperson for Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'At the moment the man’s got injuries to his shoulder and his leg but he seems to be in a stable condition. He has been taken to hospital.'
