An airport employee who came face-to-face with a serial killer in the process of violently abducting his teenage victim has criticised police for not responding with any degree of urgency.

The woman was the last person to see Donna Sue Wayne, 18, alive as she drove to work in the early hours of July 14, 1986.

Wayne's body was found a month later dumped against a tree near Aurora, Colorado. Her killer has never been identified.

Secluded: The spot on Picadilly Road near Interstate 70 outside Denver, Colorado, where an airport employee came face-to-face with a serial killer in the process of violently abducting his teenage victim in 1986

Witness: The woman has asked for her identity to be concealed because the murderer was never caught

A team of cold-case detectives is working to uncover the serial killer, or killers, who claimed the lives of dozens of young women between 1975 and 1995.

The victims were kidnapped in or around Denver and dumped at the side of rural roads outside the Colorado city.

There remain 38 unsolved murders of young women fitting the pattern during that time period, when an average of two naked bodies were found abandoned each year.

Detectives believe up to 11 of these killings could be linked to two convicted serial killers, but that the rest were committed by perpetrators who have never been caught.

Most of the victims were teenagers or women in their early 20s who engaged in 'risky behaviour' such as prostitution or using drugs.

Worryingly, police fear that one or more of the killers is still at large.

Detective Marv Brandt said: 'Sexual assault, strangulation and a desire to shock police were elements that drove the killer. That person might be 60, still capable of finding more victims.'

Cold-case detectives now believe that the immediate aftermath of the woman's random encounter was the best chance to solve at least one of 38 murders of young women in the Denver area between 1975 and 1995. The detectives think the killings were committed by a serial killer, or by several serial killers.

The Stapleton Airport worker, who has asked for her identity to be concealed because the murderer was never apprehended, was driving along Picadilly Road near Interstate 70 outside Denver at around 5.30am on that July morning in 1986 when she saw a red car weaving around in front of her.

When the car stopped in the middle of the road, blocking her progress, her vehicle's headlights illuminated a shirtless man with 'evil' eyes and a terrified girl struggling to escape.

As the woman drove around the passenger side of the car, the teenager managed to open the door and stretched her arms out in her direction, begging for help.

The woman told the Denver Post: ''She was saying "Help me! Help me!"

'He had a very intense look in his eyes. No fear. The way he looked at me, I immediately knew something was very wrong.

'I was the last person to see her alive. I had nightmares. He saw me - clearly. I saw him - clearly. And I saw her - clearly.

'And he still went on and killed her.'

A month after the incident, the airport employee read this newspaper story reporting that a girl's naked body had been found in Aurora, a few miles north of where she had seen the struggle take place. Incredibly, police had failed to make the connection

She quickly drove to the nearest house and alerted police.

But she claims the officer responding to her emergency call said the incident was most likely a domestic fight.

She believes that had police immediately launched a thorough, aggressive search for the red car they might have found Wayne before it was too late, or at the very least before her body's decomposition had destroyed vital evidence.

She said: 'I was adamant this girl's life was in danger.'

The officer and the woman drove up and down Picadilly Road looking for a red car - and found one parked at the side of the road with its engine still warm. But there was no way of knowing whether it was the same car and nobody was in sight.

Wayne's parents reported her missing the next day. A week later her red 1972 Ford LTD was found in Aurora.

A month later, the airport employee read a short newspaper story reporting that a girl's naked body had been found in Aurora, a few miles north of where she had seen the struggle take place.

She contacted police to see if it was the same girl. It was, but police had - incredibly - failed to make the connection.
