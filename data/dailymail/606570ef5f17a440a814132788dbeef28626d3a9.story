Cristiano Ronaldo stripped down to his boxers to accept former Manchester United team-mate Darren Fletcher's Ice Bucket Challenge nomination - and then called on musicians Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce and Lil Wayne to join in.

The Real Madrid forward was soaked by his compatriot Fabio Coentrao while sat on a chair wearing just a pair of purple boxer shorts at the club's training ground at Valdebebas.

On Friday, Fletcher challenged Ronaldo to take part, and the Portugal captain posted proof he had braved the ice cold water on social media on Sunday.

What a friend: Real Madrid team-mate Fabio Coentrao soaks Cristiano Ronaldo for Ice Bucket Challenge

The Ice Bucket Challenge craze originated in the United States with the intention of raising money for the Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Association. 

ALS, also known as  Motor Neurone Disease, attacks the spinal cord and can lead to speech difficulties, muscle spasms and paralysis. It affects around 30,000 people in the US and 5,000 in the UK.

Former Boston College baseball player Pete Frates came up with the idea, after his promisng career was cut short by ALS. He challenged friends and fellow Boston athletes, including some Boston Red Sox Players.

Since it began, celebrities around the world have joined in, and the craze has now spread to football.

Fletcher pledged his support to the Ice Bucket Challenge in aid of the James McCarthy Foundation, before nominating Ronaldo and another former United team-mate Wes Brown, now of Sunderland.

The Manchester United midfielder was only too happy to receive two buckets of ice cold water over his head, dedicating it to James McCarthy, a young man from Manchester who has suffered with illness ever since a car crash in 2009.

United legends Paul Scholes and Gary Neville had already undertaken the challenge after the Class of '92 match which took place last week.
