You've heard the song, you've seen the dance - now Gangnam Style, by South Korean pop star Psy, has become the inspiration for the country's tourist police.

Psy's costume designer has created snappy uniforms for the new force, comprising bright blue jackets, dark trousers, grey shirts, sunglasses and black berets.

And to add a twist to today's launch in Seoul, the hit song was played as the new recruits were unveiled - with a police drill unit performing Psy's signature horse-riding dance.

Up to 100 young men and women have been fitted out and when they stepped out on parade they issued a warning that anyone who tries to rip off tourists will have to answer to them.

Each officer will be wearing a badge to denote the languages he speaks, which include English, Japanese and Mandarin.

'Tourists who think they were overcharged by taxi drivers or street food vendors can come and talk to us,' said English-speaking recruit Park Jae-Hyoung.

'We will help settle the problem,' he told AFP.

Mr Lee Charm, president of the Korea Tourism Organisation wanted to make it clear to the recruits that they weren't formed because the country was unsafe.

'You are ambassadors who promote how safe this country is,' he said. 'From now on, you guys will be very busy having pictures taken with tourists.'

While they will be chatty with tourists and will automatically smile whenever a camera is pointed at them, the tourist police have been told that because they will not be carrying weapons they must call in regular officers if they are confronted with a crime or a dangerous situation.

South Korea has become an increasingly popular holiday destination and last year topped 10million visitors for the first time - partly thanks to interest sparked by the international Gangnam Style craze.

The song, which was released last year, made Psy a global star and it is now the most popular video of all time on YouTube, with nearly 1.8billion views.
