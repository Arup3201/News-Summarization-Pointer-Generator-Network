The BBC’s director-general was under intense pressure last night as he prepared to face MPs with the revelations from tonight’s devastating Panorama documentary into the Savile scandal ringing in his ears.

Recently-appointed chief George Entwistle is understood to have taken legal advice ahead of answering questions from the Culture Select Committee tomorrow.

Mr Entwistle, who was director of BBC Vision in 2011, will be asked why he did nothing last December when he was informed by director of news Helen Boaden that an impending Newsnight investigation into Savile might mean he would have to change his Christmas broadcast schedule, which contained a tribute to the late television personality.

Probe: The new Director General George Entwistle is facing a grilling over the BBC handling of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal

Mr Entwistle was appointed director-general earlier this year, succeeding Mark Thompson. 

A popular figure and former editor of Newsnight, he vowed to put ‘quality’ back at  the heart of the BBC.

But his critics argue that he has simply failed to grasp the enormity of the unfolding Savile scandal on three separate occasions.

The first was when he was briefed by Miss Boaden in December 2011; the second was when the decision to shelve the Savile film was publicised in January this year; and the third and final occasion was when the full horror of Savile’s crimes became clear at the start of this month.

Silent: Helen Boaden was aware of the outline of the shelved Newsnight investigation but has made no comment since the scandal erupted

MPs will grill him about how he responded
to the scandal after it emerged that ITV planned to run its own 
programme dealing with the Savile claims.

Panorama claims that Mr Entwistle was
misleading in his accounts of exactly why the Savile film  was pulled 
from the Newsnight schedules last year.

Mr
Entwistle has  said publicly that the reason it was shelved was because
the original programme was not an investigation purely into Savile’s 
abuse, but into a failed previous inquiry into Savile by Surrey police.

In an email to staff on October 5, Mr Entwistle suggested as much by saying: ‘The BBC Newsnight programme investigated Surrey police’s inquiry into Jimmy Savile towards the end of 2011.’

Similarly, the line consistently given
by the BBC has been that the reason the programme was dropped was 
because of a ‘lack of evidence’ to  confirm the specific allegation that Surrey police and the Crown Prosecution Service had scrapped the 
investigation because of Savile’s age and health.

Contradiction: Newsnight producer Meirion Jones gave a different account about the Savile report was spiked

But
two Newsnight staff members who worked on the investigation have now 
told Panorama that this  suggested the programme was about the police 
inquiry and not about Savile’s misdeeds.

Indeed, within hours of Mr Entwistle’s October 5 email, producer Meirion Jones had responded to contradict his account.

He
wrote: ‘George – one note – the investigation was into whether Jimmy 
Savile was a paedophile – I know because it was my investigation.  

‘We
didn’t know that Surrey police had investigated Jimmy Savile –  no one 
did – that was what we found when we investigated and interviewed his 
victims.’

And the reporter who worked with Mr Jones, Liz MacKean, tells Panorama: ‘The story we were investigating was very clear cut. 

‘It
was about Jimmy Savile being a paedophile and using his status as a 
charity fundraiser and television presenter to get access to places 
where there were vulnerable teenage girls he could abuse.’

Tonight’s
film will also increase the pressure on Miss Boaden, who was aware of 
the outline of the Newsnight investigation but has made no comment since
the scandal erupted.

More than 200 people have come forward to say they were abused by the TV star

Panorama reveals that she had a ‘conversation of less than ten seconds’ 
with Mr Entwistle about the film at an awards ceremony at a Hilton Hotel
in London on December 2 last year, telling him about the risk to a 
Christmas television schedule which contained a tribute to Savile.

In addition, Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, who dramatically quit last night over the affair, has always maintained that he was not put under any pressure to shelve the story.

But the documentary will hear bombshell 
claims from Miss  MacKean that Mr Rippon was feeling under pressure from
his bosses to drop the investigation in November last year.

Questions: Director general George Entwistle, left, faces a panel of MPs over the corporation's handling of the scandal which caused Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, right, to step down from his role

Panorama reveals that on November 30, 2011 – after a string of rows with Mr Rippon – Miss MacKean wrote to a friend: ‘PR [Peter Rippon] says if the bosses aren’t happy...[he] can’t go to the wall on this one.’

The Newsnight journalists also take issue with another public statement made by their editor. In defending his decision to drop the story, on October 2, 2012, Mr Rippon wrote in his BBC blog: ‘We are confident that all the women we spoke to had contacted the police already.’

But Mr Jones tells Panorama: ‘The key witness Karin Ward categorically told us she had not gone to the police and Peter was reminded many times that this was the case both verbally and in writing.’
