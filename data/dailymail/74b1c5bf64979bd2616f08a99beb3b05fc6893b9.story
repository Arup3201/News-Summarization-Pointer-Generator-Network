Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid may rule La Liga, but cast your eyes away from the glitz, glamour and silverware and head north to the Basque Country. There's a new Spanish fairytale in SD Eibar.

On Sunday, the minnows will play their first ever Spanish top flight game against Real Sociedad in front of a few thousand fans at their Ipurua Stadium home. With this, they become the smallest ever team to play in the top division.

With a capacity of 5,250 - less than 18 of the current Vanarama Conference grounds - it will be a cramped, rowdy but overall celebratory affair. That's because Eibar's place in La Liga was nearly taken away from them.

Aptly nicknamed 'the Gunners', Eibar bear some resemblance to their North London namesakes Arsenal. They are well run, self-sustainable and put on a fantastic show for supporters.

But after gaining promotion in May by finishing two points ahead of Deportivo La Coruna, Eibar were immediately threatened with a double relegation to Segunda B, Spain’s third tier.

The Spanish FA demanded Eibar should raise over 1.7million euros by August 6, because the club were required to hold a share capital of at least 2.1million euros.

Ridiculous: The Spanish FA demanded Eibar should raise over 1.7million euros by August 6 to play in La Liga

The demands of the Spanish FA were strict; seen by some as a way of keeping little old Eibar down in the lower leagues. That may be a conspiracy theory, but fans were right to point to the debt hanging over bigger teams in La Liga.

They asked how could a club with absolutely no debt be denied entry to the top flight and threatened with a double relegation?

A campaign, Defiende al Eibar – Defend Eibar – was created by the club and supported by former loan players David Silva and Xabi Alonso, who echoed these concerns.

Standing strong: Eibar's campaign to keep them in La Liga worked with the club raising the required funds 

Alonso said in May: ‘It is contradictory that a club who has an enviable financial health and with zero debts is obliged to do this, when there are others who have much deeper problems.

‘I hope we can put in a big push to keep when where they deserve to be.’

Chairman Alex Aranzabal was also perplexed by the ruling, with this example warranting a deeper look at the financial requirements policy for newly-promoted clubs.

He told CNN at the time: 'Even though we have a small budget, we have a different economic model to other clubs in Spain. We have less expenses, fewer outgoings and we always have a small deficit.

'This is something really strange in Spain because almost every team has huge debt, but in our case we have no debt.

'We think it is really unfair because the law was established to assure that all those clubs with a lot of debt had a minimum capital value to attend to all their debts.'

The campaign worked, and by selling shares for a minimum of 50 euros and maximum of 100,000 euros, the club raised the cash by mid-July; a stiff two fingers up to the Spanish FA. Over 8,000 people from 48 countries now own part of the club, from UK football fans to Americans and Chinese with a new team to look out for.

Close ties: Eibar's blue and red strip originated from Barcelona's kit

Alonso, from Real Sociedad in 2001, and Silva, from Valencia in 2005 were sent to Eibar to 'toughen them up', and the club's philosophy remains strong.

Nevermind Stoke on a wet, Tuesday night. Lionel Messi and Co will be given a stern, honest test from Gaizka Garitano’s men in March, and Barcelona will at least be able to relate to the newcomers on one level.

Eibar's blue and red strip originated from a Barcelona kit, handed to them four years after they were founded in 1940 because they were short. Those who handed the strips to Eibar would struggle to believe that 70 years later the two would clash in the top flight.

The two sides are still polar opposites in wealth and stature. In fact, Eibar are miles from any La Liga side in size.

Petit: Eibar's Ipurua Municipal Stadium currently holds a capacity of 5,250

The tiny Basque city, with a population of 27,000, would fit into the Nou Camp nearly four times; the city of Madrid 119 times. The only city in Spain with a La Liga team that comes close to the size of Eibar is Villarreal, with nearly double the number of habitants.

The total number of fans that watched Eibar in the Segunda Division last season – 63,000 – would fit in Old Trafford with plenty of empty seats for the TV cameras to scan over.

This gives you some idea of the task chairman Aranzabal and manager Garitano face throughout the 38-game season, but Eibar have recruited midfielder Derek Boateng in the last week to strengthen a side depleted by returning loan players.

Jota Peleteiro, who clocked up 11 goals last season from midfield, signed a three-year deal with Brentford this summer from parent club Celta Vigo, but striker Federico Piovaccari has arrived from Sampdoria. Other than Boateng and Piovaccari, the team is currently completely Spanish.

The next challenge is for the club to upgrade their stadium. Under La Liga rules, clubs have to increase their capacity to 15,000 in two years, and for now Eibar are building a new stand to increase the Ipurua Municipal Stadium to 6,700.

They would welcome being forced into making another upgrade next summer; it would mean they have survived in La Liga.
