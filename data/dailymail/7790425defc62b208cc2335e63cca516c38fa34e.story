Rare pictures of the U.S. Navy taken during the Spanish-American war have been unearthed after being found hidden away in storage by military archivists.

A box, containing about 150 original glass plate photographs, was uncovered at the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington DC, featuring images of all aspects of the war from logistics to diplomacy.

They were only brought to light again when the photo archive team was preparing for a major renovation and archivists Dave Colamaria and Jon Roscoe stumbled across the pictures.

Lisa Crunk, head of the photo archives branch at the Naval History and Heritage Command, said: ‘The plates were individually wrapped in tissue paper and include full captions and dates, which were likely prepared by the photographer, Douglas White.

‘Research on Mr White discovered that he was a special war correspondent of the San Francisco Examiner during the Philippines War.

‘Once it was realised what we had uncovered, there was tremendous excitement amongst the staff, especially the historians.

‘The images are an amazing find, though they were never really lost - they were simply waiting to be rediscovered.’

Plans are now in place for the entire collection to be re-housed into new archival enclosures and shelving units.

The Spanish-American war was a conflict in 1898 that ended Spain’s rule of several countries in the Americas but resulted in the United States acquiring territories in the western Pacific and Latin America.

In the build-up to the conflict, Cubans were struggling for independence from Spain and American sympathy for the Cuban rebels began to grow.

On February 15, 1898, the U.S. battleship the USS Maine sunk in Havana harbour with no explanation after being sent to the Cuban capital to protect U.S. citizens.

Two months later, the Spanish announced an armistice but the United States then declared that Cuba had a right to independence.

Spain then declared war on the U.S on April 24, with America making the same declaration a day later.

With an army and navy said to be unready for war, Spain crumbled due to the strength and power of the U.S.

On May 1, 1898, Admiral George Dewey led a U.S. naval squadron into Manila Bay in the Philippines, destroying the Spanish fleet there.

The Spanish Caribbean fleet, under Admiral Pascual Cervera was found in Santiago harbour in Cuba and U.S. forces landed to begin slowly advancing on the city.

The Spanish tried to escape and in the battle that ensued, nearly all of the Spanish ships were destroyed.

Santiago then surrendered to the U.S. on July 17, 1898, ending the war.

Later that year, Spain renounced all claim to Cuba, and the U.S. took control of Guam and Puerto Rico, former Spanish colonies.

The sovereignty of the Philippines was also transferred to America for $20million.

A year later, the Philippine-American war began after Filipino revolutionaries refused to recognise U.S. sovereignty.

The conflict lasted until 1902, when provincial governments were set up in the country.
