Defending champion Stanislas Wawrinka moved into the third round of the Australian Open with a workmanlike victory over Romanian qualifier Marius Copil.

The 29-year-old, who appeared to have some trouble with his right elbow throughout the match as he iced it during the changeovers and only recorded two aces, took just over two hours to beat the 24-year-old 7-6, 7-6, 6-3.

Copil, the lowest ranked player in the second round at No 194 and playing in the main draw of a grand slam for the first time, got the Margaret Court crowd behind him by fighting for every point and not allowing the Swiss to run away with the game.

Wawrinka, who sealed the win when a backhand drive produced a forehand error from Copil, will now play Finland's Jarkko Nieminen in the third round.

Meanwhile, US Open finalist Kei Nishikori stayed on track for another strong grand slam performance when he beat Ivan Dodig 4-6, 7-5, 6-2, 7-6 in the second round.

Dodig was serving for the fourth set at 5-4 when Nishikori broke, lashing a backhand past the Croat, who stood helpless at the net.

Nishikori wasted a match point in the 12th game before shutting out Dodig in the tiebreaker to clinch the match in just shy of three hours, delighting the hundreds of Japanese fans in the crowd.

Nishikori lost in the final of the US Open to Marin Cilic, who is not playing the Australian Open due to a right shoulder injury.
