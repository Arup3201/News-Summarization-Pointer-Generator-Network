Paul Lambert has blasted the Swiss FA over their 'mismanagement' of Philippe Senderos after the Aston Villa defender pulled his calf on international duty.

Senderos will be out for four weeks at a crucial time for Lambert, and is expected to miss matches against Southampton, Crystal Palace, Burnley, Leicester and West Brom.

The 29-year-old had only just returned for Villa, coming on as a late substitute against West Ham, after recovering from a thigh injury picked up playing in Switzerland’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia on October 9.

But he was called up again by Switzerland manager Vladimir Petkovic and damaged his calf during a training exercise.

Lambert fumed: 'That's the one I'm not happy about at all, Philippe. He is the one which has annoyed me the most. He went away with his national team and if you look at his record he has only played six minutes, against West Ham, for a month.

'He goes away with Switzerland and ends up pulling his calf in a training exercise.It's mismanagement from the FA in Switzerland. They should have been in dialogue and seen his record in the first place and that he didn't play for a month.

'It's OK for them to go away and think "We have only lost a centre-half" but we have lost him for a month again when he has been a vital part of the team.’ 

Senderos was a vital player in Villa’s promising start to the season and his absence has been felt during a difficult run of one point in seven matches.

His injury leaves Villa desperately short at centre-back for the visit of Southampton, with Ron Vlaar injuring his calf on Holland duty and Nathan Baker out with a knee problem.

Danish international Jores Okore, 22, comes into contention for Monday night’s match against Southampton at Villa Park.

'We still have options but in Philippe's case it should have been avoided. He was totally fine when he came on in that little cameo role against West Ham,' Lambert added.

'Jores is just coming back from an injury but he's getting better. We have lost two experienced players who have been playing well.’
