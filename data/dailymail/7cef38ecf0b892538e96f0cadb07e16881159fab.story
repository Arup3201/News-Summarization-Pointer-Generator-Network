Americans welcomed 236 years of independence in spectacular style on Wednesday with dazzling displays of fireworks held across the country.

Though many of the festivities were cancelled or scaled down due to weather-related power outages and wildfire concerns, it was business as usual in New York as the Manhattan skyline was lit up to the delight of the thousands who lined teh streets and millions watching at home.

Despite a day-long heat warning, thousands of revellers flocked to Manhattan’s west side to view the incredible Macy’s fireworks display, where a feat of pyrotechnics erupted over the Hudson River.

Meanwhile, millions at home watched Katy Perry give a star-spangled performance in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, donning her uniform of a purple ponytail and an American flag mini-dress and singing the aptly named hit Firework. Country music sensation Kenny Chesney also performed.

Back in the saddle: TV personality Regis Philbin, 80, seen July 4 with U.S. Naval officers, hosted the 36th Annual Macy's 4th of July Fireworks

Both performances were pre-recorded so as to avoid any snafus with inclement weather. The night’s events were MC’d by none other than Regis Philbin, who has been in retirement from Live With Regis and Kelly.

Crowds lined up early in the day along FDR Drive on Manhattan’s west side, despite a heat advisory and the promise of thunderstorms. But the weather held fast, and by sundown, temperatures were down to a cooler 86 degrees.

Viewers along 12th Avenue witnessed as 40,000 fireworks in 15 dazzling colours and 30 separate shapes filled the sky in the half-hour spectacular.

But the storms had to go somewhere, and headed north to Boston. According to CBS Boston, the Esplanade was evacuated during the annual Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular due to severe thunderstorms.

Jennifer Hudson was among those performing. The station notes that people were evacuated right before the 1812 Overture.

Hundreds of thousands from the Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic are spending the Fourth of July like America's founders did in 1776: Without the conveniences of electricity and air conditioning.

Fireworks on the National Mall in 
Washington are planned to go forward, and in New York City, huge crowds 
lined the Hudson River to view the 36th annual Macy’s fireworks show.

In
the nation’s capital, fireworks began shortly after 9pm on the West 
Lawn. Entertainment was provided by Matthew Broderick, who performed two
songs from the Broadway musical Nice Work If You Can Get It with 
Tony-nominated actress Keli O’Hara.

It
was a mix of pop and classical in Washington, as the National Symphony 
Orchestra entertained with American classics like Tchaikovsky’s 1812 
Overture with live cannon fire.
