It was more closely fought than any chart battle or awards race.

But now the three-month planning row between neighbours Jimmy Page and Robbie Williams has ended – with victory for the Led Zeppelin star.

Former Take That singer Williams, 41, has abandoned plans to revamp his £17.5million Grade II-listed London property, including excavating a huge two-storey basement.

But Williams has withdrawn the plans after Page wrote an angry letter to the local council complaining 

Veteran guitarist Page, 71, fought fiercely to stop the development going ahead – and these pictures give a glimpse of just why he was so desperate to protect his home.

Showing delicate carvings and intricately painted frescoes, the images reveal how carefully Page has maintained the original features of his own Grade I-listed property.

The rock star, worth £100million, has closely guarded The Tower House for more than four decades and his restorative works have been labelled ‘exemplary’ by English Heritage.

The house is filled with what appear to be beautiful antiques and is rich with detailed paintwork. One imposing fireplace depicts what seems to be a medieval scene, lending the mansion the feel of a castle, in keeping with its austere but impressive exterior.

Delicate: The guitarist’s home is adorned with ornate tiles

Williams, worth £120million, bought the neighbouring Woodland House – once owned by late film director Michael Winner – in 2013. He lives there with his wife, Ayda Field, 35, and their two children, Theodora Rose, two, and four-month-old Charlton Valentine.

He submitted a series of planning proposals seeking permission to redevelop the 46-room home, including building a recording studio and an indoor swimming pool.

Page immediately objected, writing a strongly-worded letter to the council warning that ‘the consequences for the building fabric and decorative finish of The Tower House may well be catastrophic’ and hiring a series of architects and engineers to blast the plans. Williams has now withdrawn his application.

The home also included a swimming pool. Williams wanted to build a new one in an underground extension

Page, who is reportedly dating actress Scarlett Sabet, 25, also fought an earlier application from another neighbour, when he released these photographs and said: ‘Many of these finishes and fittings are extremely delicate and, of course, irreplaceable and include stained glass, decorative plasterwork, painted ceramic tiling and painted frescoes.

‘The interior is complete and unblemished without any significant damage or subsequent alterations.’

Director Winner, who died in 2013, had a huge home cinema built into the house, which Williams now owns

Page was upset that building work in Williams' garden would cause disruption to the neighbourhood

The extensive building work, which included a new garage, would have meant a number of trees were felled
