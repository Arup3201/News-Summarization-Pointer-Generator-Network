A chimpanzee who used American Sign Language to communicate as the second youngest member of a family of chimps in Washington has unexpectedly died at the age of 36.

Dar was one of three signing chimps at Central Washington University after first learning to sign at infancy among both humans and chimps at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.

Dar - whose full name is Dar es Salaam for the capital of Tanzania - died of unknown causes on Saturday morning.

Tragic loss: Dar, pictured above, lived among two other chimpanzees at Central Washington University before his unexpected death on Saturday morning

Early learning: Dar, seen as an infant, was just several months old when he first started learning how to sign

An autopsy is planned for the coming days.

'Dar signed throughout his life, teaching
us about friendships between humans and nonhumans and the minds of 
chimpanzees,' said Dr Mary Lee Jensvold, who directs the Chimpanzee and 
Human Communication Institute.

'He will be dearly missed.'

The average lifespan for chimpanzees is 40 to 45 years though they can live considerably longer in captivity.

Remarkably doubling this expectancy, last December Cheetah, the chimpanzee who famously starred in the Tarzan films, died at the age of 80.

Remaining at the institute is Loulis, two years older than Dar, who was the first non-human primate to learn a human language from his mother, Washoe, who died in 2007.

Loulis, adopted by Washoe in 1979 after 
she tragically lost her own infant, was given a unique signal by his 
mother for his name, which is the adaption of the signal that means 
‘bug,’ according to the institute.

Family: Loulis and Dar are seen embracing during one of Dar's birthday parties, a day that was annually reminded by Tatu by signaling 'ice cream Dar'

Dar also leaves behind Tatu, described by the institute as being the most articulate signer of their chimpanzees.

He annually reminds his keepers of such holidays of Christmas – ‘sweet tree’ - Thanksgiving – ‘bird meat’ - and even Dar’s birthday in August – ‘ice cream Dar,’ loving dairy foods even though he is lactose intolerant.

Tatu will turn 37 this December.

Fun and games: In a favourite game of follow the leader, Tatu is seen leading Loulis while carrying bread in her mouth
