A mother whose cancer has returned for the third time has turned her back on modern medicine - and says she will try to overcome the disease through healthy living and alternative therapies.

Anne Pharo, 41, has been treated for breast cancer twice since 2010.

During this time, she has undergone two mastectomies, six rounds of chemotherapy and four weeks of radiotherapy. 

After beating the disease twice, Ms Pharo found a lump on her rib cage in October 2014 and doctors confirmed the cancer had returned for a third time.

Despite being told the disease will kill her if she doesn't embark on more chemotherapy, she has opted out of further treatment.

Instead, she and has decided to beat cancer on her own, by eating healthily, running marathons and using alternative therapies.

Now the cancer has returned, she has decided to try and overcome it on her own by eating healthily, running marathons (right) and seeking alternative treatments

After being diagnosed with cancer in 2010, Ms Pharo, who is a sible parent to James, 16, and Jessica, 13, continued going to work - only taking time off for hospital appointments - as she feared the family wouldn't survive financially if she wasn't working

Ms Pharo, a customer services manager who lives in Portsmouth with her two children James, 16, and Jessica, 13, said: 'In my opinion, chemotherapy and radiotherapy don't cure cancer. 

'That kind of treatment is just a temporary thing and the cancer does come back a few years later.

'It nearly killed me and was tough for my kids, so I decided I'd never put my body through it again. 

'Instead I took up running.

'I've also drastically altered my diet, I go for oxygen therapy every week and see a homeopath. I'm determined to get better this way.'

At her latest hospital appointment this month, Ms Pharo was told the tumour has grown since October.

Yet she is still refusing any help from the NHS, except for examinations every three months. 

She also disagrees with claims by doctors that is she allowing herself to die.

Consultant oncologist Professor Karol Sikora said there is no evidence a healthy diet, exercise and alternative therapies will cure Ms Pharo’s cancer.

However, her treatment is her own choice and doctors must respect that, he added.

He told MailOnline: ‘The patient is always in the driving seat; their treatment is up to them.

‘I would try and persuade her to have two cycles of chemotherapy, as I’m sure her doctor is doing.

‘There’s no evidence that diet alone will help without the chemotherapy.

‘With the chemotherapy, a healthy diet and exercise is beneficial.

‘But it’s not a cure, you need conventional treatment too.

‘Different people react to cancer in different ways and one has to respect that.

‘Oxygen therapy and homeopathy, these alternative therapies offer false hope.

‘There’s no evidence they work. A lot of people believe they work and that is the problem.  

‘Alternative therapists will have great stories of people who have benefitted from their therapy, but they won’t give you the real statistics, because the facts show it doesn’t work.

‘I would recommend having conventional treatment, and then by all means, have  alternative therapies as well if you really like, but don’t replace the former with the latter.’

She said: 'I don't want to put my body through any more trauma. I want to try and treat this with natural methods. 

'My oncologist isn't very happy, but it's my body after all. I am not in denial or giving up - I've even registered for a half marathon on Gothenburg this summer. 

'But I have lost faith in NHS. I wish they would consider working together with natural treatment, but instead I'm having to go it alone.'

Her first diagnosis came in January 2010, after she noticed her left breast had become misshapen. 

She said: 'It was a huge blow. My ex-husband is no longer around and I was terrified at the thought of leaving the kids behind if something were to happen to me. 

'I was desperate to get better for their sakes.

'The tumour was quite large, about 7cm long, so I said yes to everything my doctor suggested. 

'I had chemotherapy from February until June, then a mastectomy, followed by radiotherapy for two months.'

She had finished her treatment by September 2010, but describes those months as 'such a struggle'.

She said: 'I'd been very honest with the kids about what was happening to me, so it was a horrible time for all three of us.

'It didn't help that I had to work throughout the whole ordeal, while feeling sick and exhausted, 

'I was an office manager at the time and didn't feel we could cope financially if I left my job, so I stayed at work and only took time off for hospital appointments.

'I put a post on Facebook asking for advice, sort of a cry for help. 

'An old friend got in touch who had beaten cancer himself and it all started from there. He gave me a few tips to gradually change my lifestyle.

'It was a step-by-step way to get back to normal after cancer.

'My new diet was mainly based on alkaline foods. Lots of greens, avoiding anything with sugar and wheat, avoiding most meats. 

Ms Pharo began chemotherapy in January, and says the treatment was a 'struggle'. Her body suffered further the following January, when, during breast reconstruction surgery, her lung was punctured. She is pictured during chemotherapy

In October 2014, she was told her cancer had returned, but she refused surgery or chemotherapy. 'I decided it was all too invasive. I started researching other ways to treat cancer and found out about the oxygen chambers, which I now go to twice a week,' she said. She is pictured with her family during earlier treatment

'Dairy produce has been linked to breast cancer too, so that was a major thing I cut out.'

She also started exercising carefully. Initially, a ten minute walk would leave her exhausted.

But she became fitter, building up how far she could walk, until she could jog and run.

Finally, she signed up for the London Marathon to keep herself motivated.  

She said: 'Running the marathon in April 2012 was a huge achievement. I felt so much better, as though I was finally getting back to myself.'

But a subsequent medical appointment in January 2014 led to doctors picking up on a second tumour.

Ms Pharo was told in January her tumour had grown. But she is determined to keep refusing NHS treatment, and is undergoing oxygen therapy

Ms Pharo said: 'I think a lot of things cause cancer and one of the main things is stress. 

I'd been made redundant the year before, we'd packed up and moved miles from our home, plus I'm originally from Sweden so none of my family were close by to support me.'

Initially, she thought doctors had made a mistake. 

'I was in complete denial,' she said. 'I thought they couldn't possibly be right as I was on my new diet and I was still training. 

'But obviously they were right. It was alarming - the tumour was so big. There was a big lump as well as a spotted tumour all over the breast.'

She underwent a second mastectomy in March 2014 but she refused another 'damaging' bout of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 

Instead, she maintained her fitness despite the diagnosis, having signed up to run the Frankfurt Marathon in October 2014 and a week before running the marathon, a doctor discovered cancer cells next to a scar on her right breast.

She said: 'Doctors wanted me to have a CT scan right away but I refused, as the rays are 200 times more powerful than an X-ray. 

'They then scheduled surgery to remove the cancerous cells, but at the last minute I cancelled the operation.

'I decided it was all too invasive. I started researching other ways to treat cancer and found out about the oxygen chambers, which I now go to twice a week. 

'I have drops prescribed by a homeopath and I take shots of bicarbonate soda with lemon juice.

'I've also been in touch with a woman who runs a treatment centre in Bulgaria. 

'She beat cancer using natural methods, so she's going to help me raise money for treatment. The first step is having my mercury fillings removed.'
