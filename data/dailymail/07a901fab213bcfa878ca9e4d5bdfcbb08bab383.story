Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini may regret labelling Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez 'the best player in English football' come Sunday when the two Chileans meet at the Etihad.

Sanchez looked relaxed ahead of their match against the Barclays Premier League champions during a training session held by manager Arsene Wenger on Saturday.

The former Barcelona forward moved to the Emirates for £30million during the summer's transfer window, and Pellegrini knows the 26-year-old is Arsenal's chief threat.

The 61-year-old said: 'I think Alexis is a very good player, he is having a very good season in England.

'It is not easy for a player in his first season here to score so many goals, (but) Alexis is repeating what he did in the last two seasons at Barcelona and scoring a lot of goals.

'I am very happy for him because he is a young player and a very enthusiastic player and improving. The football fans in Chile are very happy for him and for the country.' 

Sunday's super showdown could potentially see Sanchez go up against City's own Argentinian talisman Sergio Aguero, but Pellegrini isn't keen to compare the two.

'I don't want to compare (Sanchez) with Sergio, but the fans will be excited to see both teams,' he continued. 

'Both teams play very attractive football and they have very good players, so we hope we will see a very good match.

'It is a very important game. Arsenal are a strong team. I always say maybe they are not top of the table but they always have high targets for every season. I hope we will have a very good game and add three more points.' 

A decision Wenger has to make is whether to stick with goalkeeper David Ospina ahead of Wojciech Szczesny, who was dropped after being caught smoking in the showers at Southampton.
