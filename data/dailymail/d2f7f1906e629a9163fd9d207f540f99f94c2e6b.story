A multi-million-dollar yacht capsized last night, dumping six people in the water in Washington.

Witnesses say the brand-new 90-foot yacht was being launched at the Cap Sante Marina in Anacortes at about 9pm after a buyer paid at least $10 million for it.

As the yacht was lowered into the water, it tilted to one side, say witnesses, and flipped over completely as it hit the water.

The six 
people on-board were helped ashore by onlookers, and one person had to 
be rescued from the bilge at the bottom of the boat.

Coast Guard Petty Officer Jordan Akiyama says two were checked out at a hospital.

KOMO reports a boom has been placed around the yacht as a precaution but there's no sign of a fuel spillage.

The yacht is reportedly worth $10 million and was being delivered to its new owner when it capsized.Â

Northern Marine in Anacortes was the builder of the boat, which had just been purchased.

According to witnesses, the water was completely calm and flat at the time of the capsize.

'The boat tilted to one side, and although not unusual, the amount of tilt was a bit more than normal,' Wes Fridell of Northern Marine told KIRO-TV.

'So we paused to collect ourselves and assure that everything was going to be right, and then as we continued to lower it down, it pitched, and that's when it went over.'

The company that built the boat will be responsible for the cost of the salvage operation.

The buyer of the boat told KIRO-TV that they are 'absolutely heartbroken' by the boat's capsize.
