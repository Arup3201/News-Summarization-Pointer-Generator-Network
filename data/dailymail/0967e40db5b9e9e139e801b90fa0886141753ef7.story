Thomas Vermaelen has had his fair share of  injury problems recently - and he endured another frustrating afternoon attempting to pull his car into the Barcelona training ground.

The Belgian defender arrived in his Audi Q5 and struggled to steer the large vehicle around the tight corner between the railings on either side of the entrance to the car park.

A crowd of Barca fans watched, laughed and attempted to aid the former Arsenal captain as he endeavoured to manoeuvre the SUV around the railings.

The 28-year-old became increasingly exasperated as he struggled to direct the car into the small gap and eventually wound down his window to ask for advice from a steward.

Onlookers looked on and laughed as Vermaelen's ordeal lasted more than two minutes.

Vermaelen is yet to make his Barcelona debut but the Catalans are sitting pretty at the top of the table after collecting maximum points from their first three fixtures.

Neymar netted twice as Barca saw off Athletic Bilbao 2-0 at the Nou Camp on Saturday.
