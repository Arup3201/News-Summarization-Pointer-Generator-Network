Four crew members who worked with Jimmy Savile on Top of the Pops were child abusers and plucked girls out of the audience to molest, it has been alleged.

Described as Savile's 'inner circle', the men, including one cameraman, sexually abused young girls while they worked for the hit BBC show, it has been claimed.

It comes as BBC Radio Two presenter Jeremy Vine has said he believes Savile
will become known as 'one of the most serious predatory paedophiles in 
criminal history.'

The men who worked on Top Of The Pops are not believed to be famous, and were not presenters on the music programme.

The allegations against them emerged after callers rang victims' charity the National Association for People Abused in Childhood.

Jon Bird, acting 
operations manager, said 'several' calls related to members of the show's 
'inner circle'. The show ran from 1964 to 2006.

He told The Sun: 'One woman, who used to be a dancer, 
says there were at least three members of backstage staff at Top of the 
Pops who used to take young girls to parties, where horrific and 
inappropriate things took place.

'We also heard an allegation about one of the cameramen.'

The charity has received 2,000 calls in the past two weeks from members of the public reporting sexual abuse. Twenty five calls referred directly to the Jim'll Fix It star.

Speaking
about the huge influx of calls Mr Bird said: 'We always knew this information was out there, but now 
people are being given permission to report it and it's clear they are 
being taken seriously. 

'Over the years we've heard many stories of paedophilia rife in the showbiz world in the 60s, 70s and 80s. Now the floodgates have opened. It's shocking that some of these people have waited so long to talk about it. It's an emotional release for them.'

Mr Bird said the charity was passing all its information about alleged offenders to the police.

A
BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC has confirmed it has launched two 
independent reviews which will cover allegations of this nature. It 
would not be appropriate to comment further until these have been 
concluded.'

Speaking at Cheltenham Literature Festival, Mr Vine said that as a father of two young daughters he finds Savile's actions 'completely disgusting.'

The veteran presenter, who has worked on the Newsnight programme had been asked by one of the audience: 'If you had been in charge of Newsnight last year what would you have done with the Jimmy Savile story?

Mr Vine replied: 'This is a complete and utter nightmare.

'The fact that a person was using his BBC prestige and maybe even BBC dressing rooms to attack young children I find completely disgusting as a father of two young daughters.

'I cannot believe that it happened for such a sustained period that we may be looking at one of the most serious predatory paedophiles in criminal history - and he was on our doorstep. I find it disgusting.'

Meanwhile, it emerged that Savile ran 'lasses only' discos at Broadmoor psychiatric Hospital in Berkshire and used the events to prey on young girls.

A source told the Daily Mirror: 'Savile did whatever he wanted at Broadmoor and nobody could stop him'.

The star hosted the discos during the 1970s as 'therapeutic entertainment' which gave him free reign to get close to potential victims away from the staff.

Today, Savile's long-time producer on children's TV show Jim'll Fix It said he was completely unaware of the presenter's activities and said the star managed to 'hoodwink' him.

But Roger Ordish said he did know that Savile had a 'predilection for younger females'.

In his first interview since the 
disclosures about Savile's alleged abuse of possibly dozens of underage 
victims over a period of many years, he described the presenter as a 
'manipulative' man.

A grinning waxwork of Jimmy Savile unveiled at Madame Tussauds at the height of his fame will never see the light of day again, it was confirmed yesterday.

The disgraced star’s £30,000 likeness is to be left along with other permanently mothballed effigies of shamed public figures - including paedophile pal Gary Glitter.

A beaming Savile posed with his waxwork in matching gold tracksuits when the figure first went on show at Tussauds flagship London site in 1986 (pictured) but it was removed in the early 1990s.

Savile joined his likeness on a bench for the unveiling sitting with his hands clasped under a mock-up of a Fix It badge saying 'Jim’ll Fix It at Madame Tussauds'.

Tussauds do not destroy their creations - but has made clear its memorial to Savile’s tarnished memory will never leave it vaults ever again.

'The figure hasn’t been in the attraction for many years and won’t be returning.'

But he told ITV1's This Morning he saw no abuse during the two decades in which he worked with the late TV and radio host.

'I
didn't see anything and nothing was reported to me,' he said.During 
their years working together, Ordish said Savile, whom he described as a
private man who 'compartmentalised' different areas of his life, even 
stayed at his home.

'He 
slept in a bedroom next to my 14-year-old daughter and I hope that is 
some indication that we had no suspicions of anything of this nature at 
all,' he said.

The disclosures about Savile's private life were made in an ITV documentary a fortnight ago which had dismayed Ordish.

'I was absolutely shocked and 
shattered and I was surprised that I had not been approached by the 
programme,' he said of the Exposure documentary.

He maintained he knew nothing about 
Savile's activities, although he told This Morning hosts Phillip 
Schofield and Holly Willoughby there had been rumours.

But he went on: 'You hear rumours about everybody famous, there must be rumours that go around about you two.

'We
were aware that Jim had a predilection for younger females,' he added, 
saying it was obvious from the way he chatted to girls.

Ordish said Savile would compliment them on their beauty, 'but nothing obscene'.

'These
are girls who are young females, they're not children. They could have 
been 14 looking like 18, but they were not children in my definition of 
the word,' he said.
