Kenny McDowall has urged Rangers supporters not to let the club down again — with police set to enforce a ‘zero-tolerance’ approach to criminal behaviour when the Ibrox side play at Falkirk on Friday night.

Elements of the club’s fanbase have come under fire after a re-emergence of sectarian singing at the recent League Cup semi-final with Celtic and at last Friday’s Championship game with Raith Rovers in Kirkcaldy.

The SPFL announced on Wednesday that they are to examine their rules covering such matters, with the absence of ‘strict liability’ allowing fans to shame their clubs with impunity.

Rangers reacted with condemnation to the singing of ‘inappropriate’ songs, telling fans attending Friday's match that additional police resources will be on site to ensure there is no repeat of the recent embarrassments.

Falkirk have also pledged support to Police Scotland in their bid to tackle the problem and revealed a rigorous search regime will be in force at all turnstiles, with a ‘zero-tolerance approach to anyone who is intoxicated’ also in place.

But McDowall is hopeful that Friday’s game passes without fresh controversy.

‘The club does not condone that kind of behaviour at all — and we’ve issued a statement on it,’ he said. ‘We’re very hopeful there will be no incidents at the Falkirk game.

‘I think there has been enough said this week. But it is not just our club.’

The SFA have also pledged to help the SPFL lay down more robust regulations to help tackle inappropriate behaviour at matches.

President Campbell Ogilvie said: ‘The Scottish FA welcomes yesterday’s statement from the SPFL confirming regulations regarding supporter misconduct will be reviewed and discussed next month.

‘It is important that the game takes a collective stance against the kind of unacceptable behaviour that depicts Scottish football in a negative light.

‘While jurisdiction for league competitions rests with the SPFL, the Scottish FA is happy to assist in the creation of more robust regulations.’

Meanwhile, McDowall hit out at the SFA decision to appeal against Steve Simonsen’s one-match ban for betting on football matches.

The 35-year-old gambled just £202 over a 12-month period on a total of 55 matches, mainly in England and Europe. He bet only once on a Scottish game — a Premiership fixture — and never on matches involving his own team.

The one-match ban — with another match suspended — handed down by the judicial panel on February 12 saw Simonsen sit out a 2-0 home loss to Hibs at Ibrox 24 hours later.

Now he faces a sweat to see if he will miss further matches after the unprecedented decision to appeal by the SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan.

McDowall said: ‘I just find it unbelievable that someone from the SFA can bring it back up again after they have appointed a panel who have made a decision on it.

‘Now (the compliance officer) isn’t happy with that decision. So, what’s the point of it?’
