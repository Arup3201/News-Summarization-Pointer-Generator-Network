The 'Supermarket Jihadi' who left Britain to become a fighter in Syria is now a policeman for Islamic State, cracking down on such 'crimes' as smoking or listening to music.

Omar Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, who was a former security guard for Morrisons, said on social media that he is now a member of the hisbah, the IS all-male police force.

The fanatic, who this month appeared in an IS video online in which he calls David Cameron a 'despicable swine', lives in Raqqa, where he arrests residents on the street or in their houses. Those found guilty of offences are lashed in public.

Militant: Omar Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, who was a former security guard for Morrisons, said on social media that he is now a member of the hisbah, the IS all-male police force

Last week, Hussain posted a picture on Facebook of cartons of cigarettes, which he boasted he had seized from a house.

Smoking or playing music is punishable with up to 30 lashes in IS-controlled areas of Iraq and Syria.

The news comes as Islamic State militants publicly crucified and murdered a teenager they accused of taking photographs of the terror group's headquarters in Syria.

Sickening images purportedly taken in the central square of the extremists' de facto capital Raqqa show the battered and bloodstained body of an unnamed 17-year-old boy strapped to a cross.

A handwritten placard hangs around the teenager's neck, accusing him of 'apostasy' - the abandonment of his religion - and says he had been crucified for three days after being caught receiving 500 Turkish lira for every photograph he took of an Islamic State military base.

The image of the murdered teenager appeared on a social media account of an activist group known as Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently. 

The group is made up of a handful of incredibly brave individuals who oppose ISIS and - despite the city being the group's de facto, the centre of its leadership and full of  bloodthirsty religious police - attempt to document the violence the terrorists group has brought to their hometown.

The image has been circulated on Twitter both by anti-ISIS campaigners and by ISIS supporters, who sickeningly trumpet it as a positive example of the group's brutal interpretation of Islam.
