Juan Mata claimed David de Gea's new haircut brought him luck after the Spanish stopper pulled off a number of impressive saves against Everton.

Manchester United won the game 2-1 with goals from Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao, but it was the performance of United's keeper that proved decisive.

The 23-year-old pulled off a string of remarkable saves - including a penalty from Leighton Baines, who had not previously missed in the Premier League - and Mata claimed the former Atletico Madrid man's new trim may have provided a helping hand.

Writing on his blog, Mata said: 'We took the lead thanks to Ángel (di Maria) and then David (de Gea) started his amazing performance. First he saved (Leighton) Baines’ penalty.

'In the second half they tied the game and later on Radamel (Falcao) scored (I am very happy for you, the first one of many more goals, I’m sure). 

'And then David did several extraordinary saves to keep the three points at home. What a superb performance! It seems his new haircut brought him luck…!'

The win moves Louis van Gaal's side into the top four of the Premier League, a position they have not occupied for more than a year.
