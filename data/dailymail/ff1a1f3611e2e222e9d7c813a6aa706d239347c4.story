A McDonald's restaurant in Australia has taken to blaring out classical and opera music from its speakers in a bid to stop teenagers hanging around outside.

The branch of the fast food outlet in the Mount Annan region of Sydney, New South Wales, began playing the music when the manager became fed up of groups of teenagers loitering late at night.

Several weeks since classical music was introduced to the restaurant, its manager claims that the unusual ploy is paying off.

Matthew Watson told the Macarthur Chronicle newspaper: 'We've noticed a reduction in the number of young people hanging around, but we'll have to reassess it properly in a couple of weeks.

'We play a range of classical and opera music and so far it seems to be working.'

Local residents commended the tactic on the newspaper's Facebook page agreeing that it was driving away youths.

Sara Carrick posted: 'Great idea and It is working!

'I work nights nearby and it has made a massive difference already to the lingering and loitering in the car park.'

But not all residents were as happy with the musical deterrent.

Janeen Brady wrote: 'They turn it up really loud when youth are hanging around the car park. It woke me up at 1am Tuesday night and it's only going to get worse as Xmas approaches.'

According to reports, a similar strategy was tried by a local council before in a car park plagued by problem youths.

But instead of using classical music, Barry Manilow songs were played from speakers instead.
