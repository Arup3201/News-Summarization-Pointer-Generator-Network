Authorities now say border patrol agent Nicolas Ivie, 30, who was shot dead during a shootout was a victim of friendly fire

A Border Patrol agent was shot to death Tuesday in Arizona near the U.S.-Mexico line, the first fatal shooting of an agent since a deadly 2010 firefight with Mexican bandits that spawned congressional probes of a botched government gun-smuggling investigation.

The agent, Nicholas Ivie, 30, and a colleague were on patrol in the desert near Naco, Arizona, about 100 miles from Tucson, when shooting broke out shortly before 2am, the Border Patrol said.

The second agent was shot in the ankle and buttocks, and was airlifted to a hospital.

Authorities have not identified the agent who was wounded, nor did they say whether any weapons were seized at the site of the shooting.

Mr Ivie is survived by a wife and two children.

No arrests have been made in the shooting. Investigators suspect that more than one person fired at the agents.

'It was basically an ambush,' said Cochise county sheriff's commander Marc Denney.

'They had a little bit of a jump on 
us. It is very rocky terrain. We're hoping that they hunkered down 
somewhere close by so that we have an opportunity to find them.'

Cochise
 County Sheriff's Office and FBI, which are both investigating the 
shooting, declined to say whether investigators have recovered guns or 
bullet casings at the scene of the shooting.

Authorities set up a checkpoint on a 
dirt road about seven miles southeast of Bisbee. A Border Patrol truck 
and another vehicle carrying two portable toilets were allowed to drive 
past the roadblock.

Tight lipped: As agents search for clues, the FBI would not confirm any details 'due to the sensitive and on-going nature of this investigation'

The Tuscon Sentinel
 cites a reporter from Fronteras Desk who claimed that two suspects have
 been detained in Mexico though their identities have not been released.

Agents 
at the checkpoint declined to comment and barred reporters from going 
further. Two helicopters from federal immigration agencies could be seen
 from a distance circling the area. And a fugitive-chase team could be 
seen staging on a roadside.

The
 area near the shooting is scattered with houses, trailers and 
ranchettes. Mesquite trees and creosote bushes dotted the landscape, and
 a mountain range stands nearby to the west.

The U.S. government has put thousands 
of sensors along the border that, when tripped, alert dispatchers that 
they should send agents to a particular location.

'It’s a very rough area — it’s 
mountainous, rocky, loose rock, low vegetation,' Cochise county 
sheriff's commander Marc Denney told The Los Angeles Times.

'It’s
 hard terrain to maneuver around. There’s not a lot of trail systems in 
place. You’re just trying to work your way around and not turn an 
ankle.'

The
 agents were fired upon in a rugged hilly area about five miles north of
 the border as they responded to an alarm that was triggered on one of 
the sensors, said sheriff's spokeswoman Carol Capas.

It is not known whether the agents returned fire, Capas said.

The wounded agent is in stable 
condition and should be released from the hospital later Tuesday, said 
George McCubbin, president of the National Border Patrol Council, a 
union representing about 17,000 border patrol agents.

The agents who 
were shot were on patrol with a third agent, who was not harmed, 
Mr McCubbin said.

The Border Patrol said Ivie worked for the agency since January 2008 and grew up in Provo, Utah.

The last Border Patrol agent fatally 
shot on duty was Brian Terry, who died in a shootout with bandits near 
the border in December 2010. The Border Patrol station in Naco, where 
the two agents shot Tuesday were stationed, was recently named after 
Terry.

Terry's shooting was 
later linked to the government's Fast and Furious gun-smuggling 
operation, which allowed people suspected of illegally buying guns for 
others to walk away from gun shops with weapons, rather than be 
arrested.

Prior to Tuesday's attack, the most recent fatality was Leopoldo Cavazos Jr. who died on July 6 due to injuries from an ATV accident near Fort Hancock, Texas.James Dominguez was killed on July 19 when he was killed by a passing vehicle while helping stranded motorists in Cline, Texas.Both Hector Clark and his partner agent Eduardo Rojas Jr. were killed when their patrol car was hit by a freight train near Gila Bend, Arizona.The case that has drawn the most publicity in recent years was that of agent Brian Terry,
 whose shooting death on December 15, 2010, during a sting operation 
shed light on the government's 'Fast and Furious' plan to track gun 
trafficking between the U.S.-Mexico border.

Authorities intended to track the guns into Mexico. Two rifles found at the scene of Terry's shooting were bought by a member of the gun-smuggling ring being investigated.

Critics of the operation say any shooting along the border now will raise the specter those illegal weapons are still being used in border violence.

'There's no way to know at this point how the agent was killed, but because of Operation Fast and Furious, we'll wonder for years if the guns used in any killing along the border were part of an ill-advised gun-walking strategy,' Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said in a written statement.

The Terry family said that the 
shooting was a 'graphic reminder of the inherent dangers that threaten 
the safety of those who live and work near the border.'

Twenty-six Border Patrol agents have died in the line of duty since 2002.

Bisbee-area
 residents expressed a mix of concern and frustration about the 
shooting, along with recognition that the border can be a dangerous 
place.

The region has seen 
its share of violence in recent years, including the Terry shooting and 
the slaying of a well-known rancher in 2010. That killing is, in part, 
credited with pushing Arizona lawmakers to pass a law that requires 
officers, when they stop someone, to check the immigration status of 
those they suspect are in the country illegally.

'There is no security on the border - none,' said Edward L. Thomas, who owns rental properties in Bisbee.
