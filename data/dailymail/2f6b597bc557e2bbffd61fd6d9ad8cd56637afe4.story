Sainsbury's is to take on Aldi and Lidl at their own game by bringing Netto discount food stores back to Britain

The exodus of middle income families to the thriving budget chains ended almost ten years of growth for Sainsbury’s and its response is to take a 50 per cent share in new Netto stores in partnership with Danish owners Dansk Supermarked.

The first Netto will open in the north of England this year with plans for 15 by the end of 2015, potentially followed by hundreds more.

Discount supermarket Netto is to make a return to the UK as part of a joint venture with Sainsbury's that will take on booming rivals Aldi and Lidl

Netto moved into the UK in 1990 and 
built up a network of nearly 200 stores in less affluent areas. But it 
exited in 2010, selling the premises to Asda in a £778million deal that 
was seen as evidence that discount chains could not survive against the 
financial muscle of the big four – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and 
Morrisons.

But the tables 
have been turned in spectacular style. Now, it is the big four that are 
losing billions of pounds in sales to Aldi, which is growing at more 
than 35 per cent a year, and Lidl, where sales are rising by more than 
20 per cent.

Aldi has 500 
outlets and is opening new stores at the rate of more than one a week 
and Lidl is also expanding at a breakneck pace. The UK discount sector 
is forecast to double in size to an annual £20billion sales in the next 
five years.

The big four supermarkets - Sainsbury's, Morissons, Asda and Tesco - are in the middle of a price war as their market shares are squeezed between discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl and upmarket rival Waitrose

Sainsbury’s and 
Dansk are each initially investing £12.5million in the venture. However,
 Jon Copestake, retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said 
the UK relaunch of Netto, which operates in a number of European 
countries, was not without risk.

‘Consumer
 austerity has carved out a growing market share for discounters such as
 Lidl or Aldi and both Netto and Sainsbury’s will be keen to tap into 
this trend,’ he said.

‘However,
 Netto is entering a very different market to the one it left. Aldi and 
Lidl have expanded aggressively and established themselves as viable 
alternatives to mid-market retailers on both price and quality.’

The
 Netto outlets will be more upmarket than previous stores, with a focus 
on fresh food and an in-house bakery offering premium Danish breads and 
pastries.

■ It has been praised for its cut-price lobster and champagne, but Aldi has flopped with a much more modest product.

Its
 Specially Selected Pork Sausages came bottom out of 13 supermarkets in a
 taste test by consumer group Which? They were described by testers as 
‘far too sweet’, and scored just 44 per cent. Top spot went to Morrisons
 with its M Signature Thick Outdoor-Bred Pork Sausages on 82 per cent.
