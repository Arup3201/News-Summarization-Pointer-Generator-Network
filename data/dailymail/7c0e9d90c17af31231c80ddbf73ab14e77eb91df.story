Every school will teach teenagers how to check for signs of cancer under Labour plans to speed up diagnosis and save lives.

A third of young people with cancer only find out after going to A&E, when it can often be too advanced to treat effectively.

The plan has the backing of Jane Sutton, whose son Stephen raised more than millions for research into the disease before he died in May after a four year battle with colorectal cancer. 

Labour has promised to extend cancer awareness lessons to every secondary school in England, inspired by the campaign of Stephen Sutton, who raised millions for the Teenage Cancer Trust,  before his death in May after a 4 year battle with the disease

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said too many students leave school without knowing about the 'warning signs' until it is too late.

Under the plan, Labour would make the Teenage Cancer Trust's cancer awareness course available to every secondary school in England.

The sessions are designed to 'demystify; the disease and encourage young people to take control of their health.

Mr Burnham said: 'Too many young people are leaving education without knowing some of the basics about cancer and how to look out for the warning signs.

'Every young person should, as part of their education, have the opportunity to learn more and know where to go if they are worried.'

He said the Teenage Cancer Trust is 'doing brilliant work' and with 'a bit more support' from Government the sessions can be made available to every school in the country.

Stephen's mother, Jane, said her son struggled with being diagnosed and backed the idea of giving young people more information about how to spot signs of cancer

Stephen Sutton launched a fundraising appeal for the Teenage Cancer Trust while undergoing treatment for colorectal cancer which eventually raised £5million.

His mother, Jane, said he struggled with being diagnosed and backed the idea of giving young people more information about how to spot signs of cancer.

She said: 'It is really important that young people are taught the signs of cancer at school.

'Stephen experienced significant issues being diagnosed and who knows what a difference an earlier diagnosis could have made.

'Unfortunately, this situation is not unique to Stephen and many young people with cancer have similar problems being diagnosed.

'We must do all we can to stop this happening to others. Students need to be taught the common signs of cancer and they must be given the confidence to go to the doctors, and to keep on going back if they feel their diagnosis isn't right.'

Stephen was awarded a posthumous MBE by the Queen for his work raising money for charity while he underwent treatment. 

He was told his cancer was terminal in 2012, and documented his treatment in a blog called Stephen's Story which was shared around the world and promoted by celebrities.

He pledged to raise for the Teenage Cancer Trust and set a modest target of £10,000, but increased his goal to £1million after he posted his 'final thumbs up' selfie on Facebook in April.

His story and the image captured the interest of celebrities and the public, and was shared around the world and people started donating in droves.

Before he died on May 14 at the age of 19, the teenager had raised more than £3million and donations continued to be made after his death, tipping £5million.

Siobhan Dunn, Chief Executive of Teenage Cancer Trust, said: 'We know young people with cancer have a poorer diagnosis experience than any other age group.

'We hear every day how they and their families often feel angry that they've not been listened to.

'We owe it to young people with cancer to be more vigilant and young people can play their part too if we teach them the signs of cancer and build their confidence to seek help and be persistent at the doctors.

'We are very grateful to Andy Burnham for his support and we urge the other parties to step up too.'

According to the Teenage Cancer Trust, the five most common signs of cancer in young people are persistent and unexplained:

Meanwhile, Labour is promising to establish a £330million cancer treatments fund to improve access to cutting-edge surgery and radiotherapy as well as the latest drugs.

Mr Burnham said the fund will build upon and expand the current cancer drugs which are due to expire at the end of March 2016.

It will be established by adding £50 million from the rebate paid to the government by the pharmaceutical industry to the budget of the existing fund.

Labour pointed to figures from Cancer Research UK suggesting that while half of radiotherapy patients should receive the intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), only a third actually get it.

It said that the number of patients receiving the stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), which is used in the treatment of lung and other cancers, fell by 10% last year.

At the same time, 124 patients were sent abroad to receive proton beam therapy as it will not be available in the NHS until 2018.

A Conservative spokesman said: 'Only a few weeks ago, Labour's (shadow) health secretary Andy Burnham spoke out against the Cancer Drugs Fund in England, and they are still denying it to NHS patients in Wales.

'Not only is today's promise unfunded, but the Cancer Drugs Fund is only affordable in the first place because of our long-term economic plan that's building a stronger economy. As a result, we've been able to back this GBP1.1 billion fund, which has helped 60,000 cancer patients get the treatment they need.

'Labour, on the other hand, simply don't have a plan, and they wouldn't be able to afford a well-funded NHS or a Cancer Drugs Fund.'
