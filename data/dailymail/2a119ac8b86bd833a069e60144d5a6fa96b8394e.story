Juventus may currently enjoy a five-point advantage at the top of Serie A but they're already keen to further bolster their strikeforce for another title assault.

According to Sunday's edition of Tuttosport, Juve director general Giuseppe Marotta is weighing up a move for PSG's Edinson Cavani in the summer.

The Uruguayan has scored 15 goals in 28 matches this season so far and would certainly be an impressive addition to Juve's front line if they can stump up the cash.

On the field, Juve host Chievo on Sunday afternoon as they try to increase the gap between themselves and Roma at the top of the table.

Tuttosport quotes manager Massimiliano Allegri as saying that 'five points are not enough' and he may well have a point though Juve are heavy title favourites.

Both Gazzetta Sportiva and Corriere dello Sport reflect on Saturday night's 3-1 win for Lazio win over Milan, a result that sees the Rome club maintain their grip on third place.

'The Rossoneri hit rock bottom' say Gazzetta, who picture the moment of madness that saw Philippe Mexes sent off for an injury time tussle with Stefano Mauri.

They report that vice-president Adriano Galliani was not impressed after Milan surrendered a lead to lose at the Stadio Olimpico and the side will try to regain their togetherness with a training retreat ahead of their Coppa Italia quarter-final with Lazio on Tuesday.

'Turbo Lazio' reads the headline in Corriere, adding that Pippo Inzaghi is feeling the heat after a defeat that leaves them ninth in the table, some 20 points behind the leaders.

Plenty to reflect on in the Spanish press after Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid - the top three - were all in action in La Liga on Saturday.

'It's heating up' say Marca after an extraordinary day that saw Cristiano Ronaldo sent off but Real Madrid still prevail 2-1 at Cordoba, Neymar and Lionel Messi score twice each in a 6-0 rout of Elche, and Atletico Madrid defeat Rayo Vallecano 3-1.

'Cristiano goes mad' they say, adding the star could miss the derby on February 7 after his senseless punch, slap and kick on Cordoba defender Edimar.

In the end, Real were bailed out by Gareth Bale, who scored an 89th-minute penalty to keep them at the La Liga summit. AS describe it as the 'Miracle in the Arcangel' as Bale's intervention secured a late victory.

The paper also commends the performance of Antoine Griezmann, who produced an 'exhibition' as defending champions Atletico kept up the pressure on the big two. 'This is the Greizmann we need,' coach Diego Simeone was quoted as saying.

Catalan paper Mundo Deportivo were understandably delighted with Barcelona's 'thrashing' of Elche and feature star men Messi and Neymar on their front page.

'They made it clear their understanding is total,' said the paper, apparently dispelling any doubt that they can play effectively together.

The result was a boost to their goal difference, of course, with Barcelona a single point and three goals behind Real, who do still have a game in hand.

Sport also features the pair on their front page, calling it a 'festival' as Barca ran riot in the second-half.
