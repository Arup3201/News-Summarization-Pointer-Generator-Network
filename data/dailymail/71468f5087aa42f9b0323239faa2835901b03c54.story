This, it has to be said, did not feel like the dawn of what Jose Mourinho has confidently predicted could be a decade of dominance for Chelsea.

It felt like a pre-season friendly that even managed to undermine the name of the stadium that staged it. There wasn't much worth seeing at the Worthersee Stadion, even if it did end in a draw with a team that finished fifth in the Austrian Bundesliga last season.

Mourinho blended a bit of experience with plenty of youth on Wednesday night and Chelsea's manager also took the opportunity to look at Filipe Luis for the first time.

Signed from Atletico Madrid in the 
summer, the full-back is clearly a player of pedigree despite having few
 chances to prove it here.

Kurt Zouma looks like he could be of some 
value to Mourinho too. He might not be a regular starter this season but
 the 19-year-old looked like something of a man mountain here in the 
South Tyrol. An extremely useful understudy.

In fairness to 
Mourinho, it is some team he now appears to be building at Stamford 
Bridge. Once he brings back more of the senior players and adds the 
quality of Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Thibault Courtois, Chelsea 
will boast a side capable of challenging for all the major honours this 
coming campaign.

The seemingly inevitable return of Didier Drogba - 
although just as a player and not a player-coach, club officials insist -
 will only add to their strength.

This, however, felt like a nod 
to the past and a look into the more distant future. A run out for some 
of the kids and what could well be one of the last run outs for Petr 
Cech in a Chelsea shirt if he is to lose his place to Courtois. It seems
 unlikely Cech would accept sitting on the bench and is therefore sure 
to take his considerable talents elsewhere.

On Wednesday, Cech 
nevertheless proved powerless to stop Silvio De Oliveira scoring for the
 hosts in the 54th minute, the long-serving Chelsea goalkeeper diverting
 the shot against the underside of his crossbar but only after the ball 
had crossed the line.

As television replays proved, it was an excellent 
call by the match officials given the absence of goal line technology.

Chelsea
 created few opportunities of their own, their best in the first half 
probably falling to Izzy Brown. The 17-year-old was left with only 
Michael Sollbauer to beat but hit his shot straight at the keeper.

But
 to Mourinho's relief Jeremie Boga did rather better six minutes from 
time, the quick, powerfully built young Frenchman holding off a couple 
of strong challenges to win the pursuit of a Branislav Ivanovic ball 
before scoring with a coolly taken finish.

Afterwards Boga said: 'It was pretty physical because they've started the season already so we had to work even harder. Today I think I was good and I got a goal. I started near the half time and played a good one-two with Iva (Branislav Ivanovic) and it's a decent finish.'

Cech added: 'To play 90 minutes for the first time is demanding but I've been working hard towards fitness. The shoulder is good - if we didn't know that I'm safe to play I wouldn't but we made the decision to go ahead.'

RZ Pellets: Kofler, Seebacher, Weber, Baldauf, Zulj, Ynclan, Trdina, Putsche, Standfest, Sollbauer, Drescher.

Scorer: Silvio de Oliviera 55.
