British Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha Cameron attended a glittering state dinner hosted by U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House last night.

The
couple arrived at 7pm local time in a black limousine and were greeted 
by Mr Obama and the First Lady, who were waiting for them at the top of 
red-carpeted steps.

As Mrs 
Cameron stepped out of the car, Mr Obama remarked, ‘Very pretty' and 
then turning to his wife he added: ‘They look better than us.’

Speaking at the White House dinner, President Obama paid lavish tribute to Mr Cameron.

'I've seen his character, I've seen 
his commitment to human dignity in Libya. I've seen his resolve, his 
determination to get the job done.'

He also made an apparent reference to the death of Mr Cameron's disabled son Ivan in 2009. 

'All of us have seen how as parents you and Samantha have shown a measure of strength that few of us will ever have to know.'

Both world leaders wore dark suits and bow ties, while Mrs Cameron was in a blue lace dress 
with a floral design by British-based designer Alexandra Rich, which she
wore with shoes from high street store Next.

She appeared to be wearing the same £180 Emilia Wickstead belt, which she wore earlier in the day and on Tuesday.

Many of the ingredients for the menu, which was called a Winter Harvest Dinner, were grown in the White House Kitchen garden and harvested on the day of the dinner.

The dinner was served in a tent which erected and lavishly decorated for the occasion.

Course one: Crisped halibut with potato crust, served on bed of braised baby kale from White House garden, shaved Brussels sprouts and micro cabbage sprouts with hint of applewood smoke bacon from local smokehouse

Salad course: Spring garden lettuces with shallot dressing and shaved radish, cucumbers and avocados

Main course: Bison wellington, using buffalo tenderloin, red wine reduction, French beans, cipollini onion

Dessert: Warm meyer-steamed lemon pudding with Idaho huckleberry sauce with Newtown pippin apples.

American wine

Miss Chapman reportedly had no clue that Mrs Obama would be wearing one of her dresses.

She told reporters: ‘I’m thrilled.’ Mrs Obama’s jewellery was by Tom Binns.

Being entertained in a tent in the back garden of the White House could have been seen as a snub to David and Samantha Cameron.

But the state banquet last night 
hosted by the President and the First Lady with the theme ‘America’s 
Backyard’ was said to be a nod to the U.S. tradition of backyards being 
the places of gathering and entertaining close friends.

Inside the lavishly decorated tent on
the South Lawn the Prime Minister and his wife were greeted with a 
glittering feast that celebrated the so-called special relationship.

Before the dinner Mrs Obama said that
guests would have more space as the dinner was hosted in a marquee 
rather than inside the White House.

She said: ‘The White House is a big 
place, but the kitchen is really teeny.  You wouldn’t believe it; it’s a
little-bitty kitchen.  So they have to really man the engines to make 
it happen.  But actually, because we’re in a tent tonight, you probably 
have more space than you usually do when we have the dinner here.’

The main course for the dinner, which
is the highlight of the Camerons’ three-day programme in the U.S., was 
Bison Wellington, a classic English dish named after the Duke of 
Wellington given an American twist with the use of Buffalo tenderloin.

Many of the ingredients for the menu,
which was called a Winter Harvest Dinner, were grown in the White House
Kitchen garden and harvested on the day of the dinner.

The braised baby kale, which was used
in the first course of crisped halibut, was from the mini-plastic 
growing tunnels that are used to grow produce throughout the year.

For dessert the guests enjoyed a 
steamed lemon pudding, another British favourite, which was finished 
with an Idaho huckleberry sauce to give it an American flavour.

At the bottom of the pudding were Newtown Pippin Apples, which serve as a symbol of the American-British partnership.

The variety was grown by Thomas 
Jefferson and George Washington and a basket was presented to Queen 
Victoria in 1838 by the American minister to Great Britain.

She was said to be so pleased with the taste that she asked Parliament to lift import duties on the variety.

A 150ft glass wall in the side of the tent, which was draped in amethyst linens with a matching carpet, gave the visitors a perfect view through the garden to the White House on the balmy spring evening.

Planters and centrepieces were designed as a celebration of the English countryside with the rose, the national flower of both countries, playing a major role in the floral arrangements.

Among the guests invited to attend the 280-strong dinner for the British delegation were golfer Rory McIlroy and Damian Lewis, the Eton-educated star of television drama Homeland, which is the President’s favourite TV programme.

Revealing his invitation to the dinner last week on BBC’s Graham Norton Show, Mr Lewis had joked: ‘It’s just the Obamas, the Lewises and the Camerons in the kitchen,’ before adding, ‘It will just be a thousand of [the President’s] closest friends, but I don’t care.’

leave Number Ten for an extended sabbatical in California, was also at 
the dinner.

Others attending included George Clooney, Olympian Denise Lewis, Warren Buffett and Vogue editor Anna Wintour.

There were around 45 British guests in attendance.

British
band Mumford and Sons, who are a favourite of Mr and Mrs Cameron, 
provided entertainment along with U.S. R&B singer John Legend, who 
was said to be the choice of the President.

Actor Idris Elba and actress Carey Mulligan, who is engaged to Mumford and Sons lead singer Marcus Mumford, also attended.

Other
guests included Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern, who play the 
Earl of Grantham and Lady Cora in Downton Abbey, which has found great 
success in the U.S. including winning six Emmys.

British business leaders at the dinner included Sir Richard Branson and Apple designer Sir Jonathan Ive.
