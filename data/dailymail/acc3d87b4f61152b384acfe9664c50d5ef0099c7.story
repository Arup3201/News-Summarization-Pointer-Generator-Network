Dead: Itzcoatl Ocampo, 25, pictured, was found in his single-man cell at Central Jail in Santa Ana Wednesday and died in hospital Thursday

A former Marine charged with murder 
in the deaths of four homeless men and two others died Thursday at a 
California hospital, a day after falling ill in his jail cell, 
authorities said.

Itzcoatl 
Ocampo, 25, was found in his single-man cell at Central Jail in Santa 
Ana Wednesday and taken to a hospital, said Orange County sheriff's Lt. 
Jeff Hallock. He was pronounced dead at about 1:30 p.m. Thursday.

No
 cause of death was immediately given, and officials said an autopsy 
will be performed in the coming days. The Orange County district 
attorney's office will investigate the death.

Prosecutors were seeking the death penalty against Ocampo. His trial was set for May 2014.

They
 alleged that the native of Mexico stabbed four homeless men in what 
they called a serial thrill-kill spree in late 2011 and early 2012.

Ocampo
 targeted his homeless victims because they were vulnerable and because 
he felt they were a blight to the community, authorities said.

Ocampo,
 who was discharged from the Marines in 2010, was also facing murder 
charges in the deaths of a school friend's mother and brother in October
 2011.

He 
told investigators he planned to kill 16 people to follow in the 
footsteps of University of Texas tower killer Charles Whitman, another 
former Marine.

Ocampo said 
he had no history of psychological problems and felt the need to kill 
after he was confined to driving a water truck and a dirt truck on a 
military base in Iraq.

The 25-year-old served an eight-month deployment in Iraq in 2008.

According to secret grand jury testimony, Ocampo reportedly joined the Marine Corps because 'he needed to kill.'

The homeless murders took place over a three-week period starting in December 2011.

Ocampo was arrested following the fourth attack, which occurred outside a Carl's Jr. restaurant in Anaheim on January 13, 2012.

The
 mother and son he was accused of slaying in Yorba Linda in October 2011
 were identified as his friend's mother 53-year-old Raquel Estrada and 
brother 34-year-old son Juan Herrera.

When he was arrested he told investigators he targeted homeless people in part because they were vulnerable, and that he believed he has a 'killer gene'.

The victims: (L-R) James 
McGillivray was stabbed outside a shopping centre on December 20; Lloyd 
Middaugh was found stabbed on a riverbed on December 28; and Paulus 
Cornelius Smit was found stabbed outside a library on December 30

Sad: The fourth victim, John Berry, 64, was killed on January 13, 2012 in Anaheim, California

Authorities said the killings were 
carried out with a roughly seven-inch military-style blade and that he 
terrorized Orange County's homeless community. Ocampo had pleaded not 
guilty to the charges.

Ocampo told investigators he started to 
kill homeless men because they were 'available and vulnerable' and 
continued stabbing his victims even after believing they were dead, 
according to the transcript.

Ocampo said he looked at Penthouse magazine before the attacks 'to pump himself up,' Wyatt said.

'He
 seemed to get excited when he was talking about the actual kill,' Wyatt
 testified. 'So, I asked him if he was aroused by the act of killing.'

Ocampo at first questioned the word arousal, according to the transcript, but then added, 'my balls felt like they were going to explode, and I knew that I had the killer gene.'

Ocampo was arrested in January 2012 
after a witness helped chase down a suspect following the stabbing of a 
fourth homeless victim outside a fast-foot restaurant in Anaheim, about 
26 miles southeast of Los Angeles.

Ocampo was initially charged with the
 four murders and prosecutors later added charges for the Yorba Linda 
killings.

Detectives said at the time they saw similarities in the cases of the Yorba Linda deaths and the stabbings of four homeless men.

Detectives
 focused on the severity of the attacks, the number and the type of 
wounds, and the proximity of Ocampo's home to the Yorba Linda killings, 
the Orange County Register reported.

Locations: Police in Orange County, California say Ocampo was responsible for four killings since December 2011

Worried: Refugio Ocampo, the father of the 23-year-old who is the prime suspect in the killings, is himself homeless and said the Iraq war killed the man his son used to be

The homeless men were identified as: 
James Patrick McGillivray, 53, who was stabbed December 20 near a 
shopping center in Placentia; Lloyd Middaugh, 42, who was found December
 28 near a riverbed trail in Anaheim; Paulus Smit, 57, who was stabbed 
to death outside a Yorba Linda library on December 30; and John Berry, 
64, who was stabbed to death on the day Ocampo was arrested.

Each of the four men was stabbed more 
than 40 times with a weapon believed to be a 7-inch fixed-blade 
military-type knife, authorities said.

Before Ocampo's arrest, police had fanned out across the county better known as the home to Disneyland and multi-million dollar beachfront homes to urge the homeless to be careful and seek shelter indoors.

Veterans Affairs officials said the high-profile violence painted an inaccurate picture of returning veterans. His father, Refugio Ocampo, said his son came back from his deployment a changed man.

He said his son expressed disillusionment and became ever darker as he struggled to find his way.
