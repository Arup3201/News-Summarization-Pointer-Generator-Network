A 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering two teenagers who were shot dead in an alleyway two years ago.

Mohamed Abdi Farah, 19, and Amin Ahmed Ismail, 18, were gunned down on the Fishermead council estate in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, on May 26, 2011.

Thames Valley Police said the teenage suspect was detained last night and is being held in police custody before being questioned.

Two men were jailed for life in January for the killings.

Fuad Awale, 25, the gunman, was told he must serve at least 38 years and Sharmake Abdulkadir, 22, was jailed for a minimum term of 32 years.

Mr Farah was shot once in the head and died at the scene, while Mr Ismail sustained two gunshot wounds to the head and died at Milton Keynes General Hospital the following day.

Mr Farah, who met Mr Ismail in Somalia in 2010, had been staying with his cousin in Milton Keynes the night before the shooting, while Mr Ismail was staying at a house in Gurnards Avenue.

Mr Farah, wearing a black hat, and Mr Ismail, in an orange hood, were seen on CCTV leaving the Xscape leisure and entertainment complex about an hour before they were shot

On the night of the shootings, Mr Ismail, Mr Farah and his younger cousin were seen on CCTV leaving the Xscape complex. At about 9.50pm, the cousin left the two friends alone.

During the trial, an eyewitness told the jury they saw a group of men arguing with two other men in an alleyway before hearing two shots.

Mr Ismail, who was the only boy in his family, came to England as a ten-year-old from Somalia, his family said following his death.

He enjoyed studying maths and science and dreamed of achieving a degree and a master's so he could look after his mother and four sisters, they said.

Meanwhile, Mr Farah's family said he had only been in the country for four weeks ahead of starting a business degree.

They described him following his death as a 'very likeable, sociable, and friendly individual, who was looking to continue his studies and go to university'.
