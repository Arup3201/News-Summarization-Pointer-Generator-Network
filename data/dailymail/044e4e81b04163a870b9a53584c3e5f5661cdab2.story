According to witnesses, the accident happened late at night on Sunday, while the camel was tied up next to a market road into the Bapunagar district.

Police say they are investigating the camel's owner, Lalisinh Rajput, to see if there had been any negligence on his part.

According to the Times of India, Mr Rajput used to tie his animal up next to the main road while he went to a nearby market.

Mr Mena was paid to take care of the animal, but had been asleep when Mr Trivedi arrived.

Kalidas Waghela, who lives in a hut close to the path, described Mr Trivedi as an alcoholic who used to come and visit his home.

He added: 'On Sunday night, Trivedi strayed near the camel on his way home. The camel got irritated and attacked Trivedi; fixing its jaws on Trivedi's head.'

Witnesses said the attack happened late a night on a market road in Ahmedabad (file image). Locals said Mr Trivedi, a builder, had been walking along when he strayed too close to the creature and it attacked

His cries woke up locals and Mr Mena, but by the time they rushed to help, it was already too late.

Mr Mena accused villagers of beating him after the camel finally let go of Mr Trivedi, and police took him to hospital for his injuries.

A police spokesman said they had recorded a verdict of accidental death. Officials have not yet decided whether to charge Mr Rajput with neglect.
