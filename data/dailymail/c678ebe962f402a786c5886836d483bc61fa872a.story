Lily Collins and Sam Claflin star in romantic comedy Love Rosie, that hit our screens earlier this month

Adapted from Celia Aherne's 2004 bestselling novel Where Rainbows End, Lily Collins and Sam Claflin play childhood friends Rosie and Alex who are constantly on the cusp of falling in love.   

The pair's cinematic relationship is totally believable. Sam reveals the director made sure that the two were a perfect match from day one.

'We were forced into a room together for a 'chemistry test' because the director wanted to get a feel for how we would get on,' says Sam.

The two actors say that they got on famously from the first moment they met

'There had been so many near attempts of us meeting and working together before, and we have so many mutual friends, that it felt right immediately.' 

Although Lily and Sam's relationship seems to be the idyllic in the fictional world, Sam is married and admits that his wife, Laura Haddock, keeps him honest in the real world.

'I constantly have to show her that I'm a good guy. Paranoia can be a killer, but it excites me and it keeps me on my toes.'

To ensure they were the perfect match the director made the two undergo a 'chemistry test' before filming

Sam says that his wife Laura Haddock can sometimes become paranoid and he has to show her he is a good guy

Lily says that filming Love Rosie has taught her that she doesn't have to settle when it comes to love

The co-stars clearly feel great affection for one another, with Lily, the daughter of Phil Collins admitting that they got on within moments of meeting.

'The second I met Sam I felt as though I had known him a year. I'd say he's an old soul, so silly, a total "bloke". He made me feel so confident, I trusted him right away.' 

The 25-year-old says that she trusted Sam immediately and he made her feel entirely confident 

Lily, who is the daughter of Phil Collins, says that her family connections have seen her face many offers of false friendship

Lily has become a good judge of character after having many false offers of friendship. 

'I learned that early on, moving to LA and having certain people immediately wanting to be friends because of my family connections, even hearing that parents would say to their kids "You should be friends with her because..." Right away I just had this warning that people can have ulterior motives.' 

Starring in a romantic comedy has taught Lily one thing about love. 

'When you know how much your heart can feel, you know that you don't have to settle for anything less.'
