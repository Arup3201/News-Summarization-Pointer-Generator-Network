The Queen last night issued an ‘unprecedented’ plea to the nation to ‘come together’ and strive for a truly united kingdom. 

From Balmoral, she acknowledged the rancour of recent days but urged people to put aside their ‘strongly-held’ opinions for the sake of unity.

Her statement, issued after SNP leader Alex Salmond resigned, was also a clear message to politicians trying to appease voters on both sides of the border.

Queen Elizabeth today released a statement on the Scottish decision to remain in the Union 

Her Majesty apparently told a well-wisher on Sunday that voters should 'think very carefully about the future' 

The Queen, attended a church service in Balmoral on Sunday with her family in a strong show of unity 

Urging the country to come together ‘in a spirit of mutual respect and support’, she implored them to work ‘constructively for the future of Scotland and indeed all parts of this country’.

The Queen made clear her own deep-seated affection for the Scots, adding: ‘My family and I will do all we can to help and support you.’

The 88-year-old monarch had resisted being drawn into the referendum debate, and senior royal sources said it was an ‘unprecedented statement for an unprecedented time in our country’s history’.

Entitled ‘A Statement From Her Majesty The Queen’, and signed Elizabeth R, it read: ‘After many months of discussion, debate, and careful thought, we now know the outcome of the Referendum, and it is a result that all of us throughout the United Kingdom will respect.

For many in Scotland and elsewhere today, there will be strong feelings and contrasting emotions – among family, friends and neighbours.

The Queen is said to look forward to her annual retreat to Balmoral and was concerned over independence

‘That, of course, is the nature of the robust democratic tradition we enjoy in this country.

‘But I have no doubt that these emotions will be tempered by an understanding of the feelings of others.

‘Now, as we move forward, we should remember that despite the range of views that have been expressed, we have in common an enduring love of Scotland, which is one of the things that helps to unite us all.

'Knowing the people of Scotland as I do, I have no doubt that Scots, like others throughout the United Kingdom, are able to express strongly-held opinions before coming together again in a spirit of mutual respect and support, to work constructively for the future of Scotland and indeed all parts of this country.

‘My family and I will do all we can to help and support you in this important task.’

Referring to the vote, a senior aide told the Mail last night: ‘She is head of state and this was a significant constitutional moment for the nation. It is right that the Queen should reflect and respond to that.

‘While the campaign was going on it was also right that the Queen should stay constitutionally impartial and she maintained throughout that period it was a matter for the people of Scotland.’

Last night, the Queen was due to mark the success of the Better Together campaign at the Ghillies Ball at Balmoral.

Until last week, Buckingham Palace had stayed out of the referendum debate. But last Sunday the Queen uttered her first public words on the subject during a walkabout after church. They were seized on by many in the No camp as an endorsement of the Union.

Speaking to wellwishers, she said: ‘I hope everybody thinks very carefully about the referendum this week.’ Constitutional experts said she chose her words carefully to maintain her neutrality on politics.

The Queen is believed to have been kept fully updated as the independence vote was counted last night

The Queen, pictured here with Alex Salmond, right, was said to be privately concerned about the prospect of Scottish independence and the breakup of the United Kingdom which she pledged to govern

After many months of discussion, debate, and careful thought, we now know the outcome of the Referendum, and it is a result that all of us throughout the United Kingdom will respect.

For many in Scotland and elsewhere today, there will be strong feelings and contrasting emotions – among family, friends and neighbours. 

That, of course, is the nature of the robust democratic tradition we enjoy in this country. But I have no doubt that these emotions will be tempered by an understanding of the feelings of others.

Now, as we move forward, we should remember that despite the range of views that have been expressed, we have in common an enduring love of Scotland, which is one of the things that helps to unite us all. 

Knowing the people of Scotland as I do, I have no doubt that Scots, like others throughout the United Kingdom, are able to express strongly-held opinions before coming together again in a spirit of mutual respect and support, to work constructively for the future of Scotland and indeed all parts of this country.

My family and I will do all we can to help and support you in this important task.
