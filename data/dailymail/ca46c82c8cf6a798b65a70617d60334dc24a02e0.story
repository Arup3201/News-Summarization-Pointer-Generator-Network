They say the old things are the best, and after six decades of beating and whisking this vintage food mixer is showing no signs of giving up.

The Kenwood Chef A700 was billed as the 'Rolls Royce of kitchen appliances' when it first rolled off the production line in 1950.

Gosia Stepien, 33, bought one of the original models for just £15 over the internet because she couldn't afford a new one.

Master mixer: Its owner admits it will smoke a little when you turn it on, but once it warms up it is perfect for making breads and cakes

The thrifty cafe worker now uses it to mix cakes, homemade bread and pizza dough at her home in Plymouth, Devon - and says she prefers it to newer models.

Gosia said: 'I saw a lady selling it for just £15 on a Facebook. I've always wanted a heavy-duty mixer but could never afford it so I thought I'd give this one a go.

'I could tell it was going to be old - late seventies, early eighties, but I didn't expect it to be this old.

'I don't think it had been used for a very long time as it was found in a loft and was very dusty and when I first turned it on smoke came out of it.

'Occasionally now when I switch it on it will smoke for 30 seconds, but then it works perfectly. I love it - it was a real bargain as the new models can sell for up to £400.'

Completing the set: Gosia also owns items from much earlier, including a grinder, a pepper mill and a 19th century cook book

The Kenwood Chef was developed by Ken Wood in Britain and the first model - the A700 - went on sale in 1950 with an array of attachments to whisk, mix, mince and liquidise food.

It was an instant success and after numerous models and updates is still Kenwood's top seller today.

Gosia uses other vintage items in her kitchen, including a coffee grinder which pre-dates World War Two and a pepper grinder which belonged to her grandparents.

She said: 'I've got several antiques in my kitchen. I also have a 19th century cookbook which I'll often use with my mixer.

'I had a black and white TV until the mid 90s because it was still working. I don't believe in throwing things away just because they're old.'
