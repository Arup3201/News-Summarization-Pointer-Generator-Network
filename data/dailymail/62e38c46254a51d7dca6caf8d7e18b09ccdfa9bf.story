Two teenagers have been arrested after a San Francisco television reporter was robbed and his security guard opened fire on the suspects, in the latest of a number of robberies targeting local television news crews and photojournalists.

Reporter Jeff Bush and the security guard were working on a story on Friday in San Francisco's Bayview district, a high-crime area, when two armed men demanded Bush's equipment.

While Bush took cover, the security guard accompanying him fired shots, hitting one of the gunmen.

‘(Bush) immediately surrendered the equipment and took cover,’ the station said.

Neither Bush nor the security guard was wounded in the incident, which occurred just before 8pm.

Officers later arrested two 19-year-old men from San Francisco and charged them with robbery, weapons and conspiracy offenses, said Danielle Newman, spokeswoman for the San Francisco Police Department.

The injured man drove himself to an area hospital, where he was treated.

Widespread: All the major San Francisco news stations have seen news crews have been robbed since March

Bush was doing a follow-up story on a fatal car crash, the employee said.

Every major television news station in the San Francisco Bay area has recently been victimized by robbery, the New York Times reported in March.

Last November, a KPIX cameraman in Oakland was robbed in front of a high school by a group of attackers in broad daylight while filming a live shot. Viewers saw the image wobble and then shut off.

In recent months, some journalists have even refused assignments in Oakland late at night.
