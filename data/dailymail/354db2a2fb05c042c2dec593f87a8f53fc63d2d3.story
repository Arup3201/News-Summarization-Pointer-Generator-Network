Democrats are claiming that America’s elderly will have to choose ‘between medicine and meals’ if Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan unseat President Barack Obama in November.

The emotive message, which is also pushed in a new Obama campaign internet ad, is designed to paint Ryan, who has tabled proposals for reforming the Medicare programme for the elderly, as a callous extremist.

Debbie Wasserman Shultz, chair of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN that electing Romney and Ryan would ‘force us back to the days’ when seniors were ‘choosing between medicine and meals…choosing between healthcare and paying their rent’.

The rush to define the Republican 
congressman from Wisconsin could be decisive in Florida, a virtual 
must-win swing state for Romney and home to 3.3 million senior citizens 
who vote in disproportionately high numbers.

Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman, denied she was being dramatic. ‘If you go back to before Medicare was a safety net in place for our seniors, you had seniors who were not able to pay for their own health care needs, whose children went medically bankrupt trying to care for them.’

The charge is based on Ryan’s budget reform plan that would gradually increase the Medicare eligibility age to 67, starting in 2023, and replace the current system with one based on vouchers.

This means that the plan, designed to
be a long-term way of reducing America’s almost $16 trillion national 
debt, would affect no one currently aged 55 or over.

Ryan
has said that those approaching retirement have planned their lives 
around Medicare in its current form and it would therefore be unfair to 
change the plan.

But the Obama campaign is clearly implying that if Romney is elected then the Medicare programme will be jettisoned.

In
a web ad sure to be followed by a television blitz, the Obama campaign 
presented a number of older Floridians bemoaning what they said was 
Ryan’s plan to end Medicare and makes the same claim Wasserman Schultz 
made.

Controversial: The ad is an only slightly subtler version of one released last year in which a man resembling Ryan pushes an old lady in a wheelchair over a cliff

The ad is an only slightly subtler 
version of one produced by the liberal Agenda Project last year. In it, a
slim, dark-suited man resembling Ryan pushes an old lady in a 
wheelchair to a rocky ledge and tips her over it so she plunges to her 
death.

At the end, the ad 
asks ‘Is America Beautiful without Medicare?’ and gives out the phone 
number of Ryan’s office, urging voters to ‘ask Paul Ryan and his friends
in Congress’. The ad ran in Ohio, Florida, Colorado and Ryan’s home 
state Wisconsin.

Fighting: The ad attacks US Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney (right) and his vice presidential running mate Paul Ryan (left)

In their first joint interview, with CBS News, Romney and Ryan defends their stance on Medicare. Ryan said: ‘My mom is a Medicare senior in Florida. 

‘Our point is we need to preserve their benefits, because government made promises to them that they've organised their retirements around. In order to make sure we can do that, you must reform it for those of us who are younger. And we think these reforms are good reforms.’

Romney said: ‘There's only one president that I know of in history that robbed Medicare, $716 billion to pay for a new risky program of his own that we call Obamacare.

‘What Paul Ryan and I have talked about is saving Medicare, is providing people greater choice in Medicare, making sure it's there for current seniors. No changes, by the way, for current seniors, or those nearing retirement.

Battle: Romney's campaign has released ads criticising Obama

But looking for young people down the road and saying, “We're going to give you a bigger choice”. In America, the nature of this country has been giving people more freedom, more choices. That's how we make Medicare work down the road.’

Wasserman Schultz said that she had not one but two parents living in Florida and on Medicare.

‘Both my parents are on Medicare and live in Florida too and I can tell you that my parents and hundreds of thousands of seniors that I represent are deeply concerned that Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney want to turn Medicare into a voucher programme.’

Medicare, she said, was ‘a guarantee for seniors that there is going to be a safety net through which we’re not going to allow them to fall’. Romney and Ryan had ‘embraced ending that guarantee – Paul Ryan’s the architect of ending it’.
