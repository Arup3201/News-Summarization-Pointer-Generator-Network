A coroner called for a review of powerboat training after a jury yesterday ruled that the deaths of a TV executive and his daughter were both accidents.

Nick Milligan, 51, and his eight year old daughter Emily were killed when his out of control speedboat hit them after they were thrown into the water following a high speed turn.

At the end of a two-day inquest into both deaths, the senior coroner for Cornwall Dr Emma Carlyon said she will write to the Royal Yachting Association to ask if it is ‘appropriate to review the advice for the level of training required for powerboats.’

Nick Milligan (left), 51, and his eight-year-old daughter Emily (right) were killed when his out of control speedboat hit them after they were thrown into the water following a high speed turn.

Her call followed an emotional plea from Mr Milligan’s older brother Brigadier Mark Milligan for safety lessons to be learnt from the tragedy, during which Nick’s wife Victoria and the couple’s other three children were also flung into the water as the 300 horsepower craft raced round in circles inflicting terrible injuries on the family.

Mrs Milligan, 40, lost the lower part of her left leg. Kit, then four, was also hit by the propeller and needed 12 operations to save one of his legs. Daughters Amber, 13, and Olivia, 12, escaped with minor wounds.

Brigadier Milligan, 54, who attended the inquest in Truro, Cornwall, with his wife Louise, said: ‘The power in some of these craft is such that in some circumstances they can be life-threatening.

‘The organisations need to take things more seriously than they have in the past. Powerboats are now more powerful than they used to be. Incidents have more devastating effects than ever before.’

Asked by the coroner what he would like to see done, he said the difference between training, qualifications and licences in the UK and in other countries around Europe should be looked at.

‘Abroad it’s compulsory to take certain courses whereas in the UK it’s voluntary,’ said Brigadier Milligan, who lives near Bath, Somerset. 

He suggested ‘best practice’ from abroad should be considered to avoid a repeat of the tragedy.

Nick Milligan and his family, from Wandsworth, South West London, were spending the weekend in their holiday home near St Endoc, Cornwall, when the Bank Holiday tragedy happened around 3.45pm on Sunday May 5 last year.

After completing several laps of the picturesque Camel Estuary north of Padstow at around 30 knots - or roughly 30 mph - in the rigid inflatable boat, called Milly, Mr Milligan took off the ‘kill cord’, which links the wearer’s leg to the ignition and cuts the engine if they fall overboard, because he needed ‘a wee’ as they headed back to shore, the inquest heard.

Mrs Milligan then took the helm but did not attach the device. She wept as she told the inquest that was her ‘big mistake’.

The children then ‘all called out that they wanted to go round again,’ she said. 

The boat, seen being tailed by a local sailor attempting to bring it under control, hit the family after they fell into the water

She did not think there was enough room to turn, but her husband, managing director of Sky’s advertising sales division Sky Media, ‘grabbed the wheel with his right hand and accelerated with his left hand’, she said.

Yesterday naval architect Lorne Campbell, who examined the boat for the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) after the tragedy, said an ‘error of judgement’ may have led to Mr Milligan pushing the throttle harder than anticipated.

‘The throttle controls move quite easily… he was not standing in the normal position where you would push it forward and back,’ he said. ‘I don’t think they would have foreseen it. This would have taken them by surprise.’

Mr and Mrs Milligan had each undertaken a powerboat training course run by the Royal Yachting Association. Instructors described Mr Milligan as a ‘keen, confident and responsible boat driver’ and his wife as ‘a very attentive student with a good level of risk awareness’, the inquest heard.

But the MAIB report found the couple were unprepared for the boat’s reaction when it was turned at speed and then ‘hooked’ - the nautical equivalent of a car spinning - as they did not have the level of boat handling skills required to control such a turn.

Captain Mike Evans, who led the MAIB investigation, told the inquest the training the couple received had not provided them with an understanding of how their boat would perform in a high speed turn. 

Tragedy: Nick Milligan, 51, and his eight-year-old daughter Emily (left) were in a speedboat with the rest of the family, Victoria and children (left to right) Olivia, Kit and Amber, when they were thrown from the boat and hit by the out of control vessel as it continued to circle in the water

The Royal Yachting Association accepted a recommendation from the MAIB to improve training earlier this year, he added.

The other key safety issues identified by the MAIB were that the ‘kill cord’ was not attached to the driver and that the occupants should be seated, holding on and as far aft, or close to the stern, as possible when boats are travelling at speed. 

The couple’s four children were all sitting or standing at the front of the boat when they were thrown from it.

Yesterday Susan Mann, a doctor who happened to be on a trip on another boat, said Mrs Milligan, whose leg was severed below the knee with the bone and tissue exposed, said, ‘My life is ruined’ and kept asking where her husband was as she tended to her after she was dragged from the water with Kit by a kayaker.

Post-mortem examinations found Mr Milligan died from head injuries while Emily had suffered fatal multiple injuries.

Victoria Milligan left the inquest after giving her evidence on Monday and did not attend the hearing yesterday when the jury returned their conclusions.
