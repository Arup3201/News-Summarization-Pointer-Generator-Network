Alastair Cook shuffled a little too far across to the off side, stayed fatally a little too far back and saw a gentle delivery from Mohammed Shami flick his thigh pad and take the top of leg-stump. It was a cruel yet somehow inevitable end to another miserable day for the England captain.

If the dismissal of Cook came almost in freakish fashion and with more than an element of bad luck then it seemed almost pre-ordained after a last-wicket stand of such frustration for England that it would have frazzled their captain.

The last thing Cook needed when he is fighting for his captaincy life was a partnership that lasted two and a half hours between two  absolute rabbits in Shami and  Bhuvneshwar Kumar that sucked all remaining life from England.

Until then 
England, with a burst of four wickets that cost just two runs, were very
 much in this first Investec Test and had done everything possible to 
keep India within reach on a pitch that could have been made for the 
visitors.

Yet
 once Shami, Test average of 3.33, and Kumar, without a half-century to 
his name, started  milking the England attack on a Trent Bridge wicket 
that simply got lower and slower then Cook’s misery was destined to 
continue.

This
 was nothing like the woeful captaincy on the fourth day at Headingley 
that allowed Angelo Mathews and Rangana Herath to guide Sri Lanka to a 
position from where they were to snatch a series victory at the very 
last gasp.

Cook
 had been pro-active with his field placings and bowling changes 
throughout India’s long vigil — almost too funky at times — and the 
bowlers who had let him down at Leeds had given their all in anything 
but home conditions.

Yet
 that painful stand of 111, an Indian last-wicket record against 
England, lifted their team from a below-par 346 for nine to 457 all out 
and the pressure had built 10-fold on a captain in need of a break.

Cook
 had only 10 minutes to unscramble his brain and try to get through the 
17 overs that remained on this second day of a series that will make or 
break his leadership.

As it turned out he could not  survive four of them.

Cook,
 in common with most of England’s batsmen, prefers the back foot and 
Steve Birks’ sub- continental pitch was never going to favour an opener 
who has not recorded a century in 25 innings and has failed to score 
more than 50 in 14 innings at Trent Bridge.

The
 first ball of the England innings from Kumar was floated down at no 
more than 78 miles per hour and swung in at Cook who got an inside edge 
onto it and guided it for a single on the leg-side. Nervy but at least 
he was on his way.

Then,
 in the second over, Shami strayed onto Cook’s legs and was punched 
confidently through square leg for four, his favourite shot perhaps 
giving him hope that he may just come through the most torrid 
examination of his mettle.

It
 was not to be. That was as good as it got for Cook who is finding ways 
of getting out to balls that would never have troubled him when he was 
scoring each of his 25 Test hundreds for England. Luck has clearly 
deserted him too. As his 10th ball somehow hit the stumps, and the 
realisation of the extent of his plight dawned on him, this  patriotic 
Nottingham crowd showed their support with a warm, sympathetic round of 
applause.

Just
 over a year ago Cook seemed destined to break every record in England’s
 run-scoring book, but his professional world has fallen apart since 
then and he will soon have to decide if he can carry on as both captain 
and opener.

There
 has been nothing wrong with Cook’s leadership in this Test, and he 
seems to have learned the lessons from Leeds, but if he is not scoring 
runs at the top of the order then he is struggling to justify his place 
at the helm of this side.

Support for Cook among his team-mates and the ECB is absolute and his position will only be an issue if England lose this Test.

Sam
 Robson and Gary Ballance took England to the close without further 
alarms and if they and the rest of England’s line-up bat big today and 
tomorrow then it will give Cook vital breathing space over which to 
consider his fate.

There is no appetite at the ECB to replace him as long as England do not go one down either here or at Lord’s next week.

But
 if they do and his barren run with the bat continues then Cook’s grasp 
on the captaincy will weaken to a point where a change will become 
almost inevitable.

The long hangover from England’s horror tour of Australia continues for Cook and Thursday was  perhaps his lowest point yet.

Time is running out now for him to save his captaincy skin.
