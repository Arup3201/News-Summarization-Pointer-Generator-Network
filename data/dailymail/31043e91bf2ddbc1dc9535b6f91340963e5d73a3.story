A terminally ill three-year-old has been given the chance to visit Disneyland thanks to the generosity of MailOnline readers.

Isabella Coomber, from London, was diagnosed with a brain tumour when she was one.

Before Christmas her mother, Jolene Hale, 33, decided to stop her treatment to allow her to enjoy the time she has left.

Ms Hale asked Isabella what she would like for Christmas and she replied that she would like to go back to Disneyland in America.

Ms Hale was heartbroken as she knew she could not afford this trip.

But desperate to make her little girl’s last wish come true, she appealed for donations.

Generous donations flowed in and Ms Hale was able to take Isabella and her sisters to Disneyland earlier this month.

She said: ‘Thanks to the amazing support we received after our story appeared we were able to make our daughter’s dream come true just in time.

‘She loved every minute of Disneyland and we made memories we will treasure forever.’

Isabella (pictured with her sister and mother, Jolene) had surgery and chemotherapy but these failed to cure the cancer. Her mother decided to stop treatment before Christmas so she could enjoy the time she has left

When MailOnline first ran a story about Isabella readers were so moved they donated enough money to pay for her and her sisters to go on holiday

Tragically, days after they flew home a scan at the Royal Marsden Hospital revealed Isabella’s brain tumour has grown.

Doctors have now warned she has just 12 weeks to live.

Ms Hale said: ‘It was not the news we wanted to hear, but we knew this awful day was coming.

The symptoms of a brain tumour depend on the size of the tumour and where it is.

As the tumour grows it will increase the pressure in the brain.

This causes symptoms such as:

‘The tumour is growing fast so all we can do is continue to fill each day of her life with laughter, joy and happiness.

‘But three months feels like being told we have just five minutes.

‘All we can do is continue to have as much fun as possible and create many more memories while Isabella is happy and pain free.’

The family have this week taken Isabella on a last minute trip to the Canary Islands to build sandcastles in the sun.

Ms
 Hale explained: ‘Ever since they told me Isabella would not make summer
 I have yearned to see the sunshine on her beautiful face one more time.

‘But unfortunately it rained pretty much every day of our trip to Florida and has rained ever since here in England.

‘Isabella
 loves toddling around with a bucket and spade so when we got this awful
 news we decided to fly to the sun while she is in good strength so she 
can feel the warmth on her back one more time.

‘It will be our last ever holiday as a family and the girls wanted to build sandcastles together.

‘When you are told the clock is ticking you can’t help but try to cram a lifetime into what few short days you have left.’

Jolene Hale said: 'Thanks to the amazing support we received after our story appeared we were able to make our daughter's dream come true just in time'

Isabella was very ill while being given chemotherapy so her doctors agreed it was better to stop treatment

The family will continue to fundraise to ensure Isabella’s last few weeks are as much fun as possible.

They also hope to arrange a daytrip to Blackpool for Isabella to ride a donkey, and a school trip with her nursery class.

Ms
 Hale said: ‘She has always wanted to go on a school trip like her big 
sister but we know that she will never get the chance. So if she can go 
on a trip with her nursery class it’s another experience we have managed
 to give her.’

Any 
remaining funds will be spent on running the Little Lion’s Den, a 
caravan providing free holidays to the families of young children with 
cancer.

Her mother said: 'The treatment will not cure Isabella so what is the point of continuing if it makes her quality of life so poor she can't enjoy herself?'

Isabella's mother says her daughter
'deserves some laughter and happiness'

Isabella was 
just one when she was diagnosed with a rare brain tumour after her 
mother became concerned that she was not developing normally.

She
 underwent surgery and chemotherapy with no success so her parents began
 fundraising to take her to America for radical new treatment.

But doctors said there was no hope of a cure and arranged chemotherapy to try and prolong her life.

Isabella's mother is now taking her to the Canary Islands to allow her to see the sun again before she dies

Ms Hale said: 'We wouldn't wish this on anyone. But the love and support from strangers who read our story has been humbling and for that we cannot say thank you enough'

But having endured ten months of the 12 month course she was desperately sick and faced spending her last Christmas either in hospital or too weak to enjoy it.

So doctors agreed with Ms Hale that treatment should be halted to allow her to enjoy quality time with her family, including sisters Rebecca, seven and Sophia, one, who accompanied her to Disneyland.
