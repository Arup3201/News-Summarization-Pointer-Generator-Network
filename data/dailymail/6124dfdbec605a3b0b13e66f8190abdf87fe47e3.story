Brendan Rodgers insists Liverpool's dressing room is not being undermined by unrest as he urged his squad to revive their ailing season by securing a League Cup semi-final place.

The scrutiny on Liverpool has been intensifying on the back of poor results and performances and Rodgers said after the 3-0 defeat by Manchester United that Liverpool needed to rediscover their team ethos.

It prompted former Liverpool midfielder Paul Ince to pinpoint Mario Balotelli and he claimed the Italian has been a disruptive influence, ruining the harmony that was in place last season during the club's pursuit of the Barclays Premier League title.

Rodgers, however, has dismissed suggestions that discord in the dressing room is compromising Liverpool's ambitions and he wants to see his squad provide the perfect response by beating Bournemouth to get within touching distance of what would be the club's ninth League Cup triumph.

'Mario has had a problem with his groin that is on going,' said Rodgers when asked if Balotelli would feature against Bournemouth. 'We will assess it. There are lots of opinions about Liverpool. Paul is someone I respect. He has been a manager and knows the pressures. Mario is here and my job is to maximise what I can get out of him and that is what I will concentrate on.

'Our dressing room is very strong. We have got a captain who is a strong leader. I have heard stories about unrest but that is absolutely not true. I believe once we get confidence back, we will be better.'

Of the test against Championship leaders Bournemouth, Rodgers added: 'It is going to be a really tough game. It is a challenge that we are up for. We want to win this competition. I saw enough at the weekend to see that things are coming back for us. It would give us confidence. If we can get the victory and get through that will hopefully give us the impetus to go on.

'This is the first competition that you can win so it is a priority. The next game is always the most important.'

Paul Ince said that he thought Balotelli had been a disruptive influence - Rodgers denied the claim 

December 16 marks five years to the day since Rodgers was sacked by Reading. Liverpool's form has led to the spotlight shining on his position at Anfield but he's not letting the pressure get to him.

'It was unfortunate (what happened at Reading) but it was the making of me as a manager,' said Rodgers. 'It's not until you have experienced it you can become better. I was able to go on and do a decent job a Swansea and I would hope that people have said I have done a decent job here. I have got great confidence in how I work and how my staff work.'
