For Downton Abbey stars, the rocketing success of their show, worldwide fame and an amazing set on which to work, is pretty hard to top.

Until Hollywood comes knocking, of course.

And this is precisely what has happened, as the show's bosses pull out all the stops, and their cheque books, to keep the stars from leaving.

Downton Abbey stars, including  Dame Maggie Smith and Hugh Bonneville, have secured bumper pay rises to appear in the fourth series of the show as work offers come thick and fast in the wake of the ITV show's global success.

For some, earnings have doubled since the first series in 2010.

High rollers: For some of the Downton stars,Â  earnings have doubled since the first series in 2010.

Reason to be cheerful: Downton Abbey bosses are only too aware that Hollywood is a major draw for the show's stars, like Dame Maggie Smith (pictured), so are offering more money to keep them

The bright lights of Hollywood have already proven too much of a temptation for actor Jessica Brown Findlay, who played Lady Sybil.

She has since taken a starring role alongside Colin Farrell and Russell Crowe in Winter's Tale due to be released in 2013.

Actors
Elizabeth McGovern, Michelle Dockery, Joanne Froggatt, Siobhan Finneran
and Rob James Collier are all understood to have negotiated bigger 
deals to stop them from following suit.

Dan 
Stevens, 29, who has moved his wife and two kids to New York while he 
appears in Broadway play, The Heiress, is also rumoured to be leaving.

The
actor, who plays Downton heir Matthew Crawley, the husband of eldest 
daughter Mary - will appear in the Christmas special but is expected to 
be written out early in next year's series.

Series four will film between 
February and July next year and it is understood the main actors have 
until early January to confirm whether they will return.

One 
senior source told the Daily Mirror: 'Because of the success of Downton,
a lot of the actors have been offered amazing roles elsewhere and some 
have been tempted.'

Downton
Abbey has been a career launchpad for many of the actors, and for that 
reason they are understood to feel a fierce loyalty to the show.

An ITV spokeswoman said: 'We do not discuss the contracts of individual actors as this is personal information.'

The programme has been sold to countries across the world, making it one of the most successful British shows.

ITV revealed that viewers can expect an emotional
tearjerker for the Christmas special.

Although
they have kept details of the two-hour special under wraps, they have 
said that the domestic staff will feature heavily in the storyline.

Laura
Mackie, ITV's director of drama even warned that audiences should have 
their tissues at the ready for the episode that will be shown on 
Christmas Day.

Stevens, 29, who plays Matthew Crawley has moved his family to New York while he 
appears in Broadway play, The Heiress, and is rumoured to be leaving
