Heather Watson plans to talk to doctors about an occasionally recurring virus type symptoms that helped sink her Australian Open hopes this morning.

The euphoria of her weekend title win in Hobart was to be short-lived as her stay in the season's opening Grand Slam event singles proved contrastingly short.

The British No 1, complaining of nausea and blurred vision, was bundled out of the first round by Tsvetana Pironkova 6-4, 6-0 in 83 minutes on what was a more humid day in the Victorian capital.

Afterwards Watson explained: 'Yesterday I woke up not feeling that great and today I struggled on the court to have energy. Against any player here it's tough enough when you're fit.'

In 2013 she suffered from glandular fever, although does not feel the sporadic bouts of lethargy are related to that: 'I have one or two days when I feel like this here and there. I'm going to see the doctor but I think it's just the way my body works.

'It's very frustrating, especially as this is one of those times I want all my energy. It sucks.'

She still plans to play in the doubles before heading home. 

Pironkova took just over an hour and 20 minutes to beat Watson in the first round in Melbourne

Watson started shakily and then called on both the trainer and doctor for treatment when she was trailing 2-5 in the first set. The treatment and delay briefly seemed to galvanise her as she got back to 4-5, but once Pironkova had closed out the first set the match ran away quickly.

Certainly this was not the usual kind of performance from the 22 year-old Channel Islander, who on Saturday collected her second WTA Tour title in Tasmania which carried her to a career high ranking of 38.

She particularly struggled with her serve, landing only 46 per cent of her first deliveries in and was unable to take advantage of the brief bouts of inconsistency of her opponent, who was cheered on by a noisy enclave of Bulgarian fans around the Spartan outside court.

It is easy to see why Pironkova has done especially well at Wimbledon (where she has been a semi and quarter finalist) as her groundstrokes, struck with her long levers, are especially flat and penetrating.

Watson looked very deflated afterwards, her defeat meaning British interest in the women's singles ending by lunchtime on the second day.
