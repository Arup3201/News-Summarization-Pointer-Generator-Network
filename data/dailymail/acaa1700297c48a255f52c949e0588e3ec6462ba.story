While England prepare for the first Investec Test against India on Wednesday Kevin Pietersen enjoyed a day out at the Race Week Exhibition in London.

With classic F1 cars on show, former champions Damon Hill was also in attendance and took part in a charity cricket match.

Pietersen was on hand for the pre-game coin toss but did not take part in the match.

Day out: Kevin Pietersen attended the Race Week Exhibition in London on Thursday

Heads or tails? Pietersen takes part in the pre-match coin toss as former F1 champion Damon Hill looks on

The 34-year-old was dressed casually for the event which was held at the Honourable Artillery Gardens Ball.

The former England captain saw his central contract terminated by the England and Wales Cricket 
board after the Ashes whitewash in Australia last winter.

England,
 meanwhile, begin their five-match Test series against India on 
Wednesday at Trent Bridge as they look to bounce back from defeat to Sri
 Lanka.
