As they bound around in a blur of fur and gleaming teeth, it’s impossible to tell one dog from the other.

But when owner Ashleigh Butler instructs them to start dancing and prancing, it’s rather easier to see who’s the professional canine entertainer who won Britain’s Got Talent – and who needs to work on his quick-step. 

‘Sullivan!’ Ashleigh shrieks as the hapless puppy springs around like a jack-in-the-box. ‘Listen! Concentrate please. No, you doughnut. Sullivan! Arghhh. As you can see he’s got a long way to go before he’s anywhere near Pudsey.’

Teaching a new dog, old tricks: Ashleigh poses with Pudsey on her back and Sully beneath

Sullivan, or Sully, or The Closet Monster of Ashpen to use his official name, is set to be the new Pudsey. There is even talk of them becoming the first ever doggy double act.

Ashleigh bought Sully 18 months ago from a family friend when he was just a week old and ever since she has been training him in case performing becomes too much for Pudsey.

But she believes her star pupil, and beloved pet, has ‘got a few years left in him yet’. 

Until then, Sully is strictly just a part of Team Pudsey. He accompanies him on most big acting jobs to be his playmate and ‘stress reliever’.

He was recently on hand in Pudsey’s trailer on set of Pudsey The Dog: The Movie, which premieres next week.

And come December the puppy protege will play the understudy – or should that be underdog – when Pudsey stars with Ashleigh in the panto Dick Whittington in Bristol.

‘Sully will be there,’ Ashleigh confirms. ‘If anything happened to Pudsey – say he became ill one day – then I’d have to go on with Sully.

'He’s done a lot more performing this year and he’s getting better. Sully thinks he’s the next top dog.

He tries to push Pudsey out of the way when they’re together.’

The Mail on Sunday has been granted an exclusive audience with the canine pair.

It is Sully’s first ever public performance and the first time Ashleigh has attempted to make them perform together. 

He may be a bit rough around the edges, but at just 17 months old Sully can prance on his hind legs, pirouette, wave, hide and beg, just  like Pudsey.

At one point both dogs stand masterfully with their paws on Ashleigh’s shoulders.

Sully can even do things his friend can not. He can reverse around Ashleigh and walk backwards like a pro. ‘Sully does look to Pudsey to help him out with the trickier moves,’ Ashleigh reveals.

‘He watched Pudsey walking on his back legs and thought, “Hmm I could give that a go” and just did it. 

‘This is the first time I’ve put them together. It’s difficult with two, but perhaps they could be a double act. I could do a routine to Anything You Can Do because they do try to outdo each other.’

Pudsey will be ten next year, but retirement looks a long way off. He looks fitter than ever, perhaps because he has his own doggy treadmill. ‘It keeps his muscles strong,’ Ashleigh says.

‘He wouldn’t be able to stand on his back legs for so long if he wasn’t fit. He’s an athlete. When Pudsey wants to retire, he’ll let us know.’

Like Pudsey, Sully is a Chinese Crested powderpuff and Border Collie cross, but has a smattering of poodle instead of Bichon Frise.

He is named after Sully from the Disney film Monsters Inc because of his blue merle colouring – ‘and he’s a little monster’.

‘He’s probably one of the naughtiest puppies I have ever known,’ Ashleigh says.

‘He steals my dirty socks. He’s quite a weird dog. He used to dig up mum’s plants and run around shaking them like a trophy.’

He has also been known to terrorise mum’s prize-winning show guinea pigs which, before Sully had his way, were allowed to roam in the family’s garden in Wellingborough.

‘Sully caught a couple and decided to de-hair them,’ Ashleigh says. ‘It took six months for their fur to grow back.’

Star in the making: If anything happens to Pudsey, Ashleigh says Sully will take over

Sully’s arrival did not go down well. ‘Pudsey wasn’t impressed,’ Ashleigh says.

‘For two weeks he blanked him entirely. When he realised he wasn’t leaving he gave up and played with him instead. Now they’re like brothers; they’re inseparable.’

Ashleigh herself has blossomed from a shy 16-year-old on Britain’s Got Talent to a 19-year-old brimming with confidence and grand plans.

She admits to not doing very well in her AS level exams last year, but says dog dancing is her career now. 

With more than £1 million in the bank thanks to her BGT winnings, a book and calendar deal, many, many appearances and, of course the movie, one can forgive her for feeling unfazed by her lack of educational success.

She wasn’t in Pudsey: The Movie, bar a few shots of her in the crowd, but seems resigned to playing second fiddle to her beloved pooch.

‘I’m not envious of my dogs,’ she says. ‘I won Britain’s Got Talent because of my dog and Pudsey is a lot cuter than I am. But I’d like to move forward without my dogs. I’d like to get into presenting one day.’

But right now, she has her work cut out with naughty Sully. 

‘This morning we got home to find the police at our door,’ Ashleigh says.

‘The dogs had got out of their room and set the burglar alarm off. I must say Sully looked very sheepish. I’m sure he was the culprit.’
