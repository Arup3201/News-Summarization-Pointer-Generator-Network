In some ways the goal against Leicester City was better.

The initial control is even more delicate, as the ball never bounces but remains airborne, there is an extra touch, guiding the ball around Matt Elliott and he uses both feet.

The point was once put to Dennis Bergkamp. Which was better, he was asked? The goal against Leicester or the goal against Argentina? Bergkamp didn’t hesitate. ‘Argentina,’ he said. The reason?

‘Because it was the World Cup quarter-final.’

Context is everything when judging great goals and Bergkamp has a long list of contenders up for discussion: this one, though, was definitely the greatest.

Breathtaking: Roberto Ayala can only watch as Dennis Bergkamp beats Carlos Roa with a sublime finish

Touched by genius: Dennis Begkamp wheels away after steering Holland past Argentina with a wonderful goal

There
 are countless wonderful goals scored every week from Hackney Marshes to
 Filbert Street, all of them good, all of them special. But the reason 
for being a professional footballer is to perform on the biggest stage 
in front of a global audience. You are judged on how you perform there, 
under the most extreme pressure. And in that isolated moment against 
Argentina, Bergkamp was sublime.

Given
 that Louis van Gaal has been criticised in Holland for his departure 
from Johan Cruyff’s Total Football, it is worth recalling that Holland’s
 finest piece of skill at the World Cup finals came from a long ball. Or
 a long pass, as Frank de Boer would put it.

From
 De Boer’s 50-yard pass, which was from within his own half, Bergkamp 
somehow controlled the ball immediately, delicately bringing it down 
with a touch. But that is just the first of three moments of exquisite 
football. The second is the switch in body shape to touch the ball onto 
the ground and swivel past Roberto Ayala.

‘After
 the second touch I know this can’t go wrong,’ said Bergkamp, though 
plenty of ordinary footballers couldn’t vouch for that quite as 
certainly. Good as his word, the finish, leaving goalkeeper Carlos Roa 
no chance, formed the third part of a moment of aesthetic beauty.

‘You’re
 in that moment,’ said Bergkamp later. ‘That’s the feeling. After the 
first two touches… that moment! It’s like your life has led up to this 
moment.’

It
 wasn’t just that magnitude of the game that elevated the goal. Holland 
had been down to ten men, with Artur Numan having been sent off, and 
Bergkamp wasn’t even playing well. In fact he shouldn’t have even been 
playing at all, give that he had stamped on Yugoslavia’s Sinisa 
Mihajlovic in  the previous round, an act of aggression the referee had 
missed.

Early lead: Patrick Kluivert fired Holland ahead in the 12th minute with a typically instinctive finish inside the box

Level pegging: Claudio Lopez fired Argentina level six minutes later after outwitting Van der Sar

Argentina
 looked the more likely winners when, on 87 minutes, Ariel Ortega 
advanced into the Dutch penalty area and took on Jaap Stam before 
falling to the ground. The referee was not deceived, no penalty was 
awarded and as Edwin Van der Sar walked over to berate the Argentine for
 diving, Ortega jumped up, directing his forehead at the Dutch 
goalkeeper’s chin in a head butt. Ortega was off and suddenly it seemed 
the match had been equalled up with ten against ten for extra time.

Except
 that, 53 seconds after the re-start following Ortega’s red card, 
Bergkamp’s strike was landing in the back of Argentina’s net.

A game which had been slipping away from Holland had turned on a minute of frenzied action.

‘I
 don’t think you can ever play a perfect game,’ said Bergkamp once, 
before being reminded of that goal. Wasn’t that perfection? ‘Yeah,’ 
conceded Bergkamp. ‘That moment is perfection.’

But perfection never lasts. Holland went out on penalties to Brazil in their semi-final three days later.

Bergkamp rates it as the best strike of his career - better than the beauty against Leicester at Filbert Street

It is ironic that the finest piece of skill from Holland, the nation of Total Football, at the World Cup finals came from a long ball
