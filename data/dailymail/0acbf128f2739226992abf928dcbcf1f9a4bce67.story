The man who pointed a gun at a photographer in front of Pippa Middleton is a senior adviser to one of the world's leading small arms manufacturers, it emerged today.

Lawyer Romain Rabillard, 36, was pictured aiming what looked like a semi-automatic pistol as he drove his convertible Audi through Paris.

Others travelling in the car on Saturday have described the gun as a 'children's toy', claiming that the whole incident was a 'joke and a funny game'.

Ladies' man: Mr Rabillard has this week taken time off work and disappeared from his £2,000-per-month rented penthouse in central Paris

But a source at the German arms 
manufacturer Heckler & Koch today confirmed that Mr Rabillard 
represented them in legal matters.

He
recently advised them on a multi-million pound refinancing deal, 
regularly meeting with Heckler & Koch representatives in France and 
Germany.

The firm is well 
known for its range of USP semi-automatic pistols, which are used by the
military, police forces, security firms and private individuals who 
need to defend themselves.

The
revelation follows claims that the French police were told to scale 
down their investigation into the threatening of a photographer because 
of Pippa's involvement.

Mr Rabillard has, meanwhile, taken time off work, and disappeared from his £2,000-per-month rented penthouse in central Paris.

Mr
Rabillard, who was called to the Paris bar in 2005, technically faces a
prison sentence of up to seven years if prosecutors can prove that the 
weapon is real.

Even if it was a fake gun - or one modified to fire blanks - Mr Rabillard could be jailed for up to two years.

He
has been 'lying low' since pictures of the incident were published, 
said a close friend, and was today absent from his desk at Shearman and 
Sterling, the American law firm based on the Champs Elysee.

Mr Rabillard, who is single, is part of a fast-living set of Parisians who have grown close to Pippa in recent years.

He
is frequently seen driving around the city in his convertible Audi, and
attends friends' parties in London, on the French Riviera, and in the 
Alps.

Gun drama: With Pippa Middleton in the front seat, driver Romain Rabillard aimed what looked like a semi-automatic pistol as he drove his convertible Audi through Paris on Saturday

Taking aim: As the others laugh and smile, the driver of the car Pippa was in points the pistol directly at a photographer

In recent publicity photographs he is shown dressed as a boxer and as a pouting gigolo with a chest wig and dark glasses.

A
photo taken at a particularly wild party shows a wild-eyed Mr Rabillard
dressed in his boxer shorts and an open shirt after downing a glass of 
spirits.

'Romain is a very hard working lawyer, but he absolutely loves to let his hair down,' said a close friend in Paris.

'He's
always planning holidays and weekends away, and ends up being the life 
and soul of the party. Calling him a wild man would be about right!'

The
emergence of Mr Rabillard's name comes as police in the French capital 
said they were ordered to 'downscale' the enquiry into the Pippa 
incident following 'an intervention from London'.

Today they said the case was a 'low priority' - prompting accusations of a cover-up.

'If the suspects involved were ordinary kids from the estates they would have been brought in by now,' said one officer.

'As
it is this case is being dealt with at a very high level. Lots of 
meetings have taken place to discuss the sensitivity of the issue, and 
there has been an intervention from London.'

France
is currently on heightened security alert after Islamic terrorist 
Mohammed Merah used a handgun to murder seven people in the south-west 
of the country last month.

Two
men were also arrested in the Paris area at the weekend in connection 
with four murders carried out with a pistol in the nearby Essonne 
department over the past five months.

On
Friday, Pippa, whose sister is Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, 
attended a lavish fancy dress party to celebrate the 30th birthday of 
Arthur de Soultrait, a Paris fashion entrepreneur.

Arthur
can be seen sitting in the back of the Audi wearing a blue baseball 
cap, alongside a man believed to be his younger brother, Marcy de 
Soultrait.

Marcy de 
Soultrait insisted the gun in question was a child's toy and that the 
royal in-law thought the entire incident was 'a very funny game'.

Mr De Soultrait claimed: 'It was a children's toy that the driver had in his car. Pippa thought it was funny.

'It
is fine in France to do that and the police are not investigating. In 
France there is no problem, just in England. You English think there is a
problem, which is crazy.

'I
have spoken with Pippa, she thinks this is all a joke and a funny game.
We were just having a laugh. We are funny people, it's what we do.

'The
paparazzo saw the toy and he knew it was a toy, he has said so. You 
English need to get over it. It was just a joke that has been blown out 
of all proportion.'

A 
source close to the photographer who was threatened said he denied Mr De
Soultrait's claim, saying: 'He was extremely scared. This was not a 
joke.'

A source at Shearman
& Sterling confirmed that Mr Rabillard last year represented 
Heckler & Koch in a £295million high yield bond offering designed to
refinance the company.

Asked where Mr Rabillard was, the source said: 'He's gone away. You will have to contact him via his email.'
