Cleaning up after a party is never fun but try cleaning up after Europe's biggest street party.

Notting Hill erupted into a full blaze of colour for a second day yesterday as thousands lined the streets for Carnival.

Performers wearing a vivid array of stunning costumes paraded through the roads under the glorious Bank Holiday sunshine.

But despite the party going off with a bang, the clean-up operation went into full swing last night to remove the mountains of rubbish left behind in west London at the end of the two-day celebrations.

Around 168 people were arrested at the event yesterday, with offences ranging from sex attacks to GBH.

In total, 279 arrests were made at the festival, Scotland Yard said.

Of these, 58 were public order offences, six were criminal damage and 18 were possession of an offensive weapon.

There were 16 assaults on police and 91 drugs arrest, two people were arrested for sexual assault, 12 for robbery and six for GBH.

Despite reported crime being down, brawls did break out at the annual street party in west London

In total, 279 arrests were made at the festival as trouble spread through the west London streets with offences ranging from sex attacks to GBH

Fifteen theft arrests were made along with 13 common assault arrests. The remaining arrests were for other unspecified offences.

However, reported crime at this year's Carnival is 'significantly down' on last year's event, according to police.

Chief Superintendent Michael Johnson said a combination of factors had helped keep offending to a minimum during Europe's biggest street carnival event.

He said: 'Early indications from yesterday are that crime is significantly down on last year, but we never like to put that out in the public domain without knowing exactly what those figures are.

'It is very difficult because some people won't report it (crime) until they get home or go somewhere else, so we want to make sure we get the figures absolutely right.'

'At the moment, certainly from our point of view, yesterday went very well. We're very confident that hopefully we have had a result this year and achieved a reduction in crime.

'A lot depends on the weather, but it's a very unique experience. You have one million people in a small part of London, going around, lots of music and lots of loud noises. It is something you have to experience.

'The vast majority come here to experience carnival. The officers out there have done a fantastic job.'

The unique sights, smells and sounds filled the residential streets of west London as many revellers returned for a second day's partying.

On Sunday, known as family day, both young and old dancing to giant sound-systems set up on street corners, while procession performers wore multi-coloured costumes, played steel drums and danced behind trucks which pumped out anything from reggae to dancehall, and calypso to dub.

But it will be up to the local council to make sure the streets are left prestine after the party.

Nick Paget-Brown, leader of Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council, praised organisers, police and carnival attendees for making the event a success.

He added: 'From what I gather, things have gone well and people have enjoyed it.

'The challenge now is to make sure the streets return to good working order as soon as possible when the carnival ends. That is challenge I am sure the council will rise to.'

Not to be left out of the fun, London's police also got in on the celebration - by performing an impromptu dance off.

Dressed in full uniform, stab vests, florescent jackets and battons, the officers broke out their finest moves to impress the crowd.

The comic moment was caught on video by one of the hundreds of revellers who had cleared a circles too see if the policemen could outshine the carnival performers.

The carnival has been held in London’s Notting Hill since the 1960s and has since spread to other locations, such as Kingston and Leeds.

It was first organised by West London’s prominent Afro-Caribbean community and will celebrate its 50th anniversary on August Bank Holiday 2016.

Notting Hill Carnival is the largest street festival in Europe and over one million people has been expected to take part in the festivities this year.
