She might have just become a mother for the fifth time but it seems Katie Price, 36, has no intention of putting her feet up. 

Between writing a new book, signing up with a hair colour brand and slamming Kim Kardashian's naked magazine cover, the former glamour model has found time to create a new fragrance named 'Kissable Fierce'.

'It's my first evening fragrance that I've released and I love it,' she said in an exclusive interview with MailOnline.

New look: Katie Price is unveiling her latest fragrance, Kissable Fierce, and says it's reflective of her personality and smells 'gorgeous' 

'It's an extension of my Kissable line  - the bottle is so cool and I love the fact it's pink and black - two of my favourite colours.'

Price, 36, who gave birth to her fifth child in August, also said that not only are the orange and peach notes  'gorgeous', she's been getting plenty of compliments while wearing it.

But it is the name of the fragrance, Kissable Fierce, that most reflects Ms Price, who said it was inspired by her personality.  

'I think the name Kissable Fierce is quite reflective of my personality,' she explained. 'I'm the most loyal person and fun-loving and kind but if people take advantage of those good qualities I can have a fierce side that comes out too.' 

One for the Christmas stocking? Katie's new fragrance is just the latest in a roster of celebrity scents but she maintains that hers is different and she apparently gets plenty of compliments when she wears it

And despite being one of a veritable deluge of celebrity fragrances, Price says hers is different - and it's all down to her experience of the showbiz world.

'I've been doing this for a long time,' she explained. 'My perfumes have been best sellers and I'm involved in every aspect of the production as well. 

'I started creating Kissable Fierce a year ago and wanted to bring out an affordable, long lasting evening perfume that my fans would like.'

The perfume is, she says, an extension of her changing lifestyle and reflects the more mature, more sophisticated woman she is today.

Indeed, the 36-year-old claims that she's so disinterested in beautifying herself - apart from for public appearances - that the only thing in her make-up bag is a tub of Vaseline.

'The older you get, the less interested in make-up you are. A smokey eye is ageing and with five kids, the last thing on my mind is make-up,' says Price.

'In fact, I don't wear any. Vaseline is the only thing in my make-up bag to keep my lips moisturised.' 

So what does 'beauty' mean to the star? 'My children and relaxing at home with them and having quality time.'

Family is clearly important to Price, who has managed to overcome husband Kieran's infidelity and presented a united front at the recent Hunger Games premiere in London.

She also used the glamorous night as a platform to show off her post-baby body, which, as photos reveal, is more toned than ever.

'I'm quite good at eating healthily but biscuits are my weakness,' she admits. 'The day starts off well with a freshly made juice but it goes downhill, usually in the evening.

'This is the problem with my fitness - I come up with all these ideas to work out and then I literally don't have time. 

'I'm working on the release of Kissable Fierce, I'm Global Ambassador for CB4, I've also got to factor in writing my next autobiography, which I'm doing at the moment, and then TV work and my TV role for Channel 7 in Australia plus the kids, my husband and family and friends.'

Still with us? Good, because she is also working on a photo call for the perfume, penning her next tome, celebrating Superdrug’s 50th Anniversary with the Medichem team, doing 'something that hasn't been done before' and heading over to Australia again - all in the next few months.

 'I am looking forward to getting back to work,' added the model. 'The next year is looking good for me and I can’t wait. 

'I’ve moved house, it’s a fresh start and I am eager to get back to doing what I do best - working.'

Back on track: Katie Price and Kieran Hayler are looking to the future and Katie says true beauty is spending time with her children and relaxing at home
