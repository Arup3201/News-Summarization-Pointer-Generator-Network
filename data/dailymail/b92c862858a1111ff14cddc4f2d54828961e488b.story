Cristiano Ronaldo found himself upstaged by Real Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema and former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba on Saturday night as France beat Portugal 2-1 in their international friendly.

Ronaldo, sitting on the bench with an ice pack on his left knee after being substituted on 76 minutes, could do little to turn Portugal's fortunes around at the Stade de France after the hosts took a third-minute lead through Benzema.

Portugal substitute Ricardo Quaresma set up a tense finale by slotting home a penalty for the visitors, but France held on to their slender advantage.

Portugal lose another game (and possibly Ronaldo too through injury), Poland stun Germany to win in Warsaw, while Northern Ireland go top of Group F!

I'll leave you with the results of tonight's qualifiers but make sure you check back tomorrow for live coverage of Estonia vs England. I'll see you then. Cheerio.

With games ticking over into injury time, the camera flicks to Ronaldo on the Portugal bench who seems to have an ice pack on his knee. One to watch...

I thought there was a goal coming but not from Poland! Moments after Bellarabi blasts over the bar for Germany, Lewandowski fends off pressure inside the Germany box before squaring for Sebastian Mila to tuck home into the bottom corner. The celebrations are wild with Poland on the cusp of beating Germany for the first time.

How on earth have Germany not equalised?! Bellarabi sees a stinging 16-yard shot beaten away by Szczesny, while Lukas Podolski has just crahesd a rocket of a volley off the crossbar with his Arsenal team-mate well beaten between the Poland sticks.

Logic, eh. Sometimes it doesn't quite work. The world's best player in Ronaldo departs and his replacement Joao Mario wins an instant penalty after being tripped by Pogba, which Danny dispatches past Mandanda.

We've hardly seen anything from Ronaldo tonight but he goes close to pulling a goal back. A powerful shot across goal was heading for the corner until Raphael varane blocked the ball behind.

Ronaldo has since departed to be replaced by Joao Maria.

Portugal have looked close to hopeless at times and should be 3-0 down. Blaise Matuidi skips past a sliding tackle as he advances on goal, only to place his one-on-one shot across goal wide.

Slapstick defending from Portugal, it really is. Patrice Evra somehow skips past two defenders on the byline before cutting the ball back for Benzema. The striker then lays the ball off for Paul Pogba to tuck home low into the bottom corner. That should be that in Paris.

Even though there are just over 20 minutes left, the more of this game I watch the more convinced I am that Germany will grab an equaliser. They have opportunities and one has just passed by as bellarabi pokes straight at the keeper after running on to a pass.

Northern Ireland continue to press for a third goal and only poor finishing denies them. Niall McGinn does the hard work by bringing the ball into the box after cutting inside from the right, but Connor McLaughlin then steals in to scuff a first time shot wide across goal. He looks frustrated with himself and so he should be.

Half-chance for Portugal but Eliseu's cross towards the near post is claimed by Steve Mandanda in front of the sliding Nani.

Brilliant save from Szczesny! Andre Schurrle arcs his body to bend a shot towards the bottom corner, but the Arsenal keeper leaps to his right to beat the ball away.

At the other end Lewandowski leaves a sneaky foot in while challenging Bayern Munich team-mate and keeper Manuel Neuer and unsurprisingly picks up a booking.

Against the run of play? probably. Does it bring this game to life? Definitely! Warsaw erupts as Germany fail to deal with a diagonal ball, before Lukasz Piszczek recycles the ball by lofting a cross into the box where Arkadiusz Milik heads home.

A Germany onslaught in 3, 2, 1...

A very pedestrian opening to the second half. Portugal have much of the ball but my word, their passing tempo is almost at walking pace. France could defend this until the cows come home whether it's against Ronaldo or not.

Before the start of the half, Cristiano Ronaldo was the only player standing in the tunnel for the visitors - looking ahead in deep concentration as team-mates trailed far behind. I wonder if the skipper had a strong word or two at the break?

Having beat Portugal, Albania are on course for another shock as they lead Denmark. Speaking of Portugal, they have been second best in France as they trail the Euro 2016 hosts 1-0 in Paris.

The half-time whistle came at the right time for Poland with Germany just starting to up the pressure in Warsaw, while Greece and Northern Ireland will certainly be pleased with their work in the first 45.

On the cusp of half-time, the hosts nearly extend their lead further as Oliver Norwood's swerving shot from 25 yards forces Nielsen into a rather unconvincing punch over his bar.

Meanwhile in Paris, it's really not Ronaldo's night. The Real Madrid forward attempts about three-to-four stepovers before eventually wasting possession. Manchester City defender Eliaquim Managala has been booked for a foul on Danny.

Two super chances for Germany to open the scoring. First Karim Bellarabi squeezes a shot narrowly wide across goal from a Mario Gotze cross, before Thomas Muller sees a shot deflected wide after pouncing on to a through ball on the counter attack. Germany are going through the gears.

It's a harsh spot-kick awarded as Ferguson is booked for tugging down Joan Edmundsson, but from the penalty Frodi Benjaminsen sees his shot pushed on to the post by Roy Carroll before the hosts scramble clear. Justice is served.

It's yet to really get going in Warsaw, but Germany have done well to keep the home crowd relatively quiet so far.

The visitors win a corner which results in Jerome Boateng's long range drive deflecting into the path of Thomas Muller, whose outstretched volley across the target is well saved by Wojciech Szczesny.

Encouraging applause from Fernando Santos on the Portugal bench, as Andre Gomes turns well on the edge of the box before scooping a shot over the bar.

And it really should be three as Lafferty peels off his marker to head a cross towards the bottom corner, only for Gunnar Nielsen to dive down low and parry behind.

I had concerns that Northern Ireland would slip up tonight, but they are in complete control at Windsor Park! A lovely near post cross is chipped in by Shane Ferguson, where Kyle Lafferty is on hand to divert a finish home with a cute touch.

Poland have never beaten Germany but they are giving the world champions a fair contest so far. The hosts even want a penalty as Robert Lewandowski goes down under pressure from a defender in the box, but that would have been very soft had it been awarded.

No response from Portugal yet as Rui Patricio again has to be alrt to deny Antonie Griezmann. A very quite start from Cristiano Ronaldo so far.

Fast starts are in the air this evening as Northern Ireland also race ahead with Gareth McAuley putting the home side in front.

Maybe things have to get worse before they get better for Portugal! In just the third minute, France lead! Bacary Sagna's low shot across goal from a low cross is well saved by Rui Patricio diving low, but first to the rebound is Karim Benzema to tap home.

Portugal, playing in white, get the action going in the Stade de France

And what a contrast in scenes. To the relative few inside a Windsor Park under redevelopment to the packed National Stadium in Warsaw where Poland are hosting the world champions in Germany.

Shane Ferguson is handed his first competitive football of the season as Northern Ireland make two changes for their Euro 2016 clash against the Faroe Islands.

Ferguson, yet to kick a ball for Newcastle this term, replaces the injured Chris Brunt from the side which defeated Hungary last month, while Niall McGinn is promoted from the bench having scored in that match.

The game takes place at a Windsor Park stadium in the process of redevelopment, with just two stands open and a reduced capacity of 10,500.

Try telling Portugal that! They are in crisis following the shock loss by Albania last month and today gives Cristiano Ronaldo and friends a chance to restore some national pride as they visit a rather handy France team in Paris.

It's Fernando Santos's first game in charge of Portugal so can he turn around their fortunes against the Euro 2016 hosts?
