A human skull, jawbone and teeth from a disturbed grave have been discovered scattered around a churchyard after workmen dug up the ground during maintenance.

Amateur historian Kirsty Olley made the grim discovery as she was trying to find out more about her family history at St Margaret’s Church at Old Catton, Norwich.

It is believed the remains were from an ancient grave which was accidentally disturbed by workmen while they were building a new toilet and kitchenette on the 15th century site.

The area of excavation has not been used for burials since 1899.

Mrs Olley, of Thorpe Marriott, said: 'It was quite obvious by the state of the churchyard that they had recently had some ground works.

'But to find human remains of these poor people who were laid to rest many years ago was both very disturbing and very upsetting.'

The parochial church council (PCC) of St Margaret’s Church has now apologised.

A PCC spokeswoman said contractors have been building a new toilet and kitchenette.

She admitted it was 'regrettable' procedures had not been followed and said the contractor was 'extremely apologetic'.

She said: 'While most of the work was carried out within the church building, there was some excavation, mainly in front of the church entrance.

'Under Church of England regulations, excavated soil from a consecrated churchyard cannot be removed and has to remain in the churchyard.

'Some may be re-used for backfilling, but the remainder has to be stockpiled and then spread and levelled within the churchyard.'

She said that during the spreading and levelling of excavated material some bone fragments had been found.

'The procedure for dealing with bone fragments is that they should be collected by the contractor, bagged, labelled and carefully stored for subsequent re-interment,' she said.

'In this instance, the fragments were collected, but not bagged and stored.

'This is regretted by the contractor, as well as the PCC.'

She said the bone fragments were collected, bagged and removed from the churchyard within two hours and were now securely stored.
