Tragic: Brian Holland, 44, died of internal bleeding three years after he swallowed his own false teeth

A disabled man died of internal bleeding three years after he swallowed his own false teeth, an inquest has heard.

Brian Holland, 44, who suffered from mytonic dystrophy, swallowed the upper dentures while vomiting in Offerton, Manchester, in May 2010.

He was taken to hospital on May 9 last year after his condition deteriorated - with drastic weight loss, difficulty eating and coughing up blood.

However, doctors and specialists were unable to find the cause of his symptoms, and he died following emergency surgery at Stepping Hill Hospital.

Now, an inquest in Stockport has revealed that Mr Holland died from internal bleeding after the false teeth severed a major artery. 

A pathologist found the dentures had become
 lodged in his lower oesophagus, before eventually wearing through the 
oesophagus wall and perforating the aorta.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Coroner John Pollard said the hospital had 'missed opportunities' in treating Mr Holland, whose disease caused his muscles to gradually waste away. 

Mr Pollard said medical staff had been unaware that the patient had swallowed his false teeth - but would have discovered and safely removed the dentures if they had examined him thoroughly between May and July 2010.

He added that Mr Holland’s treatment had been ‘less than optimal’ - and also criticised vital information not being included in his medical records and passed to other medical professionals.

'A number of occasions and a number of opportunities to diagnose and successfully treat his condition were missed,' he said.

Stockport NHS Foundation Trust has since apologised and carried out an investigation.

A spokesman said improvements had been made at the hospital, including the introduction of an electronic system to record patient details.

'It is clear that we missed important opportunities in the care of Brian Holland and for that we are very sorry,' he added.

Mr Pollard said he he would write to the Department of Health and Stockport NHS, University of South Manchester NHS Trust, where Mr Holland was also treated, over the concerns raised during the inquest.

He added that he would specifically ask for dentures to feature a metal marker on them so that they would show up on X-rays and scans.
