Salford kept their play-off hopes alive with a 38-18 win over Hull KR at the KC Lightstream Stadium.

The Red Devils came from 12-4 down at half-time to run out easy winners with a destructive second period when they scored six tries.

For Rovers, it was a second successive defeat under new coach Chris Chester, whose play-off hopes remain in the balance.

Head over heels: Josh Griffin scores Salford's sixth try of the game during the victory over Hull KR

There was nothing between the two sides 
for the first quarter of the game as defences dominated. Josh Hodgson, 
who looks set to play for Canberra Raiders next season, opened the 
scoring in the 20th minute, after squeezing through from dummy half. 
Travis Burns added the extras.

Eight minutes later Mason Caton-Brown enhanced his growing reputation by getting round the right edge of Rovers' defence to score. Josh Griffin missed the conversion to leave the home side 6-4 in front.

Back came Rovers with a Craig Hall try two minutes later. Rovers half-backs Kris Keating and Burns combined well to send Hall over for his fourth try in his last two home games. Burns added the conversion to give KR a 12-4 lead.

Salford ended the first half on the attack by forcing a goal line drop out, but Rovers came up with a solid defensive stand to keep the Red Devils out.

The away side were back in the game two 
minutes into the second half. Niall Evalds capitalised on some poor 
Rovers tackling to scamper through to score under the posts. Griffin 
landed the conversion to reduce the deficit to 12-10.

Salford then took the lead for the first time in the game when Hall was guilty of trying to do too much. Running the ball out from under his own posts, he lost the ball in a one-on-one tackle with Greg Johnson.

With the ball lying free on the ground, Junior Sa'u picked the ball up and grounded it. Griffin's successful conversion made it 16-12 to the Red Devils. Rovers then should have drawn level but Josh Hodgson lost the ball trying to ground it.

Not content with gifting Salford one try, the Robins made it easy for Salford to score their fourth. Omari Caro made a mess of gathering a kick and left the ball behind. Griffin gratefully accepted the invitation to score and added the extras to give Salford a 22-12 lead.

Rovers lost their talisman Burns for 10 minutes after taking exception to Tommy Lee's tackle and Rovers' problems worsened when Theo Fages found a big gap in the home defence to score. Griffin gave his side a comfortable 28-12 lead by adding the extras with 20 minutes to play.

Griffin added to his points tally with another six points after being put through brilliantly by Evalds in the 68th minute as Rovers accepted their fate.

Salford were not finished there and Greg Johnson ran through the home defence for his side's seventh try.

Michael Weyman's 76th-minute try, converted by Burns, was nothing more than a consolation try for Rovers.
