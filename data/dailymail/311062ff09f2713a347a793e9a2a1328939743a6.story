Barcelona's La Liga campaign looked set to get off to an unlucky start on Sunday evening as a black cat ran on to the pitch at the Nou Camp in the second minute of their opening league match against Elche.

Blaugrana boss Luis Enrique saw the funny side of things in the Barcelona dugout, and was seen laughing and joking with his coaching staff and players on the bench.

The black cat, reportedly known as 'Pusskas', spent a couple of minutes evading the attentions of both sets of players and Barcelona staff, with Elche goalkeeper Titon doing his best to sweep the plucky feline into his arms.

Barcelona went on to record a 3-0 win thanks largely to two goals from Lionel Messi.

Pure entertainment: The cat offered more of a threat than Lionel Messi in the early stages at the Nou Camp

1. In March 2013 a fan let a chicken loose on to the pitch during Blackburn's  1-1 draw with rivals Burnley, reportedly in protest against poultry company Venkys, who own Blackburn.

2. Footballer Luis Moreno was heavily criticised after kicking and killing an owl that ventured on to a pitch during a 2011 match.

3. Four years ago a herd of sheep attacked Tour de France riders during the 174km 17th stage between Pau and Col du Tourmalet. 

4. When the England rugby team clashed with Scotland at Twickenham in 2011, a fox stood on the pitch before the game and respectfully observed both national anthems.

5. Argentine basketball star Manu Ginobili managed to catch a bat with his bare hands during a game in 2009.

The cat eventually picked up by a member of staff at the Nou Camp, and ushered out of the ground.

Twitter exploded with posts about the cat, and within minutes three accounts had been set up paying homage to it. 

In Spain, like in many European countries, black cats have been considered an object of superstition since the Middle Ages, due to supposedly bringing bad luck and curses to any human they go near. They are also associated with witchcraft. 

It is not the first time a match at the Nou Camp has been interrupted by a black cat, with one scampering on to the pitch during Barcelona's 2-1 win over Real Sociedad in February 2012. 

The Catalan giants were not affected by the presence of the cat on that occasion either, and ended a run of three consecutive draws, their worst run of results of the season at that point. 

It also coincided with Lionel Messi breaking a relative drought in front of goal, as he scored the winner for then coach Pep Guardiola's side.

Finally caught: The cat is carried away from the pitch so play can get back underway in Barcelona

Twitter sensations: Camp Nou Cat has joined Anfield Cat in having a Twitter account set up in its honour

In February 2012 the 'Anfield Cat' became an internet sensation after running on to the pitch during Liverpool's Premier League clash against Tottenham, which finished 0-0.

Play was held up in the 11th minute when the cat darted on at Anfield and ran towards Spurs goalkeeper Brad Friedel's goal.

At the last count @AnfieldCat had 54,600 followers on the social media site.
