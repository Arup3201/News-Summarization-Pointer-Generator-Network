Horror: Rhoda Youson was left unrecognisable after being attacked with a garden fork and a bat at her home in Nuneaton

A grandmother murdered in her own bed with a pitchfork and a wooden bat was beaten so savagely that her face 'caved in', a court heard.

Rhoda Youson, 57, was found dead by police who forced their way into her blood-spattered flat in Nuneaton, Warwickshire.

A trial at Birmingham Crown Court heard there was 'nothing left' of her face after the sickening attack, in which she suffered multiple fractures to her skull, jaw and cheekbones and damage to her hands, shoulder and neck.

Homeless Anthony Hall, 47, denies Mrs Youson's murder.

He was one of a number of homeless people that the 'generous' grandmother used to invite into her home and cook meals for, the court was told.

The trial heard Hall set upon Mrs Youson, who lived alone in the flat, with a garden fork and a bat on November 22 last year.

Philip Bennetts, prosecuting, said: 'The following day Hall told several people that he had done something bad.

'He
mentioned to a customer at a betting shop that he had killed someone 
and told a friend that he had killed Rhoda and had caved her face in.

'She had massive injuries to her head and there was nothing left of her facial area. Blood was splattered on the walls.'

Jurors
were told Hall, who has an alcohol problem, met with his social worker 
days after the attack had taken place and confessed to ‘bashing someone 
with a pitchfork'.

'Nothing left': Hall was one of a number of homeless people who 'generous' Mrs Youson would invite into her home and cook for

A garden fork was found in a car park near to the grandmother’s home alongside a carrier bag containing a broken wooden bat.

Both items were later identified as belonging to Mrs Youson and had blood, tissue and hair samples on them.

The QC told the court that Mrs Youson had two daughters and lived alone in sheltered housing in Blythe Court following her divorce.

'She drank heavily and became friendly with street drinkers,' he said

'She was generous with money for homeless people she met.

'Hall was one of those people, who she used to invite to her home and cook them meals,' Mr Bennetts told the court.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
