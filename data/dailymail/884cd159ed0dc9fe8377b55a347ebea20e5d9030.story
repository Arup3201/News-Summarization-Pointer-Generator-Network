When customers order a coffee from this Starbucks, employees are not allowed to write their names on the cup or top up their loyalty points.

It may go against the day-to-day operations seen in most of the coffee chain's stores around the world - but this one is in the CIA's headquarters.

The nine baristas who work at the cafe in the heart of the forest compound in Langley, Virginia, are given thorough background checks, are frequently taken through security briefings and are led out of work every day by agency 'minders'. 

Covert coffee: The CIA's Starbucks is located deep in the heart of their headquarters in Langley, Virginia. It is referred to as 'Store Number 1' on the receipts but customers have given it the nickname 'Stealthy Starbucks'

The venue is known as Store Number 1 on the receipts, but its loyal customers have given it the nickname 'Stealthy Starbucks'.

Because of the facility's security it is believed to be one of the busiest stores in the world, according to The Washington Post.

Many cannot leave during the working day to simply grab a cappuccino or a muffin, which means the queues often stretch down the hallway.

One agent, who was annoyed at the time it takes to get a beverage, is said to have once whispered to someone at the back of the line: 'What have you done for your country today.' 

A food services supervisor, who wanted to create a more relaxed atmosphere, tried to get customers to start writing their names on cups.

But the change in policy quickly made the agents feel uncomfortable.

He said: 'They could use the alias "Polly-O string cheese" for all I care. But giving any name at all was making people — you know, the undercover agents — feel very uncomfortable. It just didn't work for this location.' 

It also has to be staffed 24 hours a day for agents working in different time zones or in the middle of an operation. 

According to employees, this means that sugary Frappuccinos and double espressos are popular orders at night, while vanilla latte and lemon pound cake are frequently ordered during the day. 

But, when they get home, they cannot boast where they work only saying it is in a 'federal building'.

There are no reward cards as agents fear the data could fall into the wrong hands and undermine their security - or even identify them. 

Hidden identity: When customers order their drinks, their names are not written on the cups. A food supervisor considered the idea to speed up lines, but it quickly made agents feel 'uncomfortable'

Like many others around the globe, the shop is the site of many job interviews. 'Coffee goes well with those conversations,' one officer said. 

For example, the chief of the team that tracked down Osama Bin Laden recruited a key deputy for the effort at the Starbucks.  

The manager of the store is reportedly trying to humanize the store, creating a more relaxed environment for those who work there.

Many of the federal employees sit in windowless offices for long periods of time and cannot even check their phones during a break - they have to leave them in their car for security.
