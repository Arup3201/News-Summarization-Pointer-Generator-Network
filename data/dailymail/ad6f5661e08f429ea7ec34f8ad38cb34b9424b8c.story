Two package thieves who trailed a UPS van, picking up its deliveries as they went, were caught by an eagle-eyed neighbor who pictured them in the act.

Brandon Ancell, 19, and Brandon Chait, 18,  stole boxes of clothing, computer speakers, make-up and dog food from 26 doorsteps in Detroit, Michigan, police said.

But their spree on Thursday at 11.30am was foiled by a homeowner who spotted them outside his window and called 911.

Caught red-handed: A homeowner photographed Brandon Ancell, 19, running with this Macy's box which had apparently been delivered moments before by a UPS van on Thursday morning in Detroit, Michigan

He then used his cell phone to photograph Ancell running gleefully from a property in broad daylight - with a Macy's box in his grasp.

Deputies say the teens were opening the boxes, throwing the packages away and keeping the goods. 

Police located the suspects' 2010 Nissan Ultima within minutes of the call, The Smoking Gun reported.

The vehicle contained the contents of at least 26 stolen packages, deputies claim. It has since been impounded.

Lt John Michalke of the sheriff's office warned residents: 'If you are expected to receive packages through the mail, use tracking software that's available.

'If you're expecting packages, be aware, be on the lookout for your neighbors.' 

Ancell and Chait were arrested and charged with theft and conspiracy to commit theft. Ancell is also charged with possession of marijuana. 

They have both been released on $5,000 following their arraignment on Friday.
