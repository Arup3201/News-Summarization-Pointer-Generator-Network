Quiet suburban life in a neighborhood outside San Diego came to a smashing halt Wednesday afternoon when an aging U.S. Marine Corps fighter jet crashed into three homes and burst into flames.

Miraculously, no one was hurt.

The pilot of the AV-8B Harrier safely ejected before it crashed into a home in Imperial Valley, California, near the Mexican border about 4.30pm, Pacific Time.

Three homes were damaged and at least one destroyed in impact and subsequent blaze.

At least one house caught fire after an AV-8B Harrier jet smashed into a home in Imperial Valley, California, on Wednesday afternoon

Three homes were damaged - one of which was destroyed - when the jet slammed into the neighborhood

Military investigators worked into the night gathering evidence and trying to determine what caused the crash of the $30million fighter

The 1980s-era Harrier jet is known for it's ability to take off and land vertically like a helicopter thanks to jump jet thrusters direct thrust at the ground.

The planes cost about $30million each.

Neighbors told the Imperial Valley Press that the crash felt like an earthquake.

Plumes of smoke could be seen rising high above the neighbor from miles away from the crash site.

Video from the scene shows fiery debris cluttering the streets and sidewalks of the neighborhood.

The pilot was taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation. Video shows him being helped by good Samaritans, his parachute still attached, after he come down in a parking lot a shot distance from the crash site.

The jet was based out of the Third Marine Aircraft Wing in Miramar, but the yet took off Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona.

It is the second Harrier jet to crash this month. On May 9, a plane went down about 40 miles outside Phoenix. The pilot was able to safely eject then, as well.
