'He was a great cricketer. His death has so affected people because it happened at the midst of life most exuberant,' Mr Abbott said.

'People are not supposed to die playing our national game, (his death showed) that life is both precious and fragile, we mourn with his family, we grieve with his team-mates, particularly Michael Clarke who has shown such leadership, we feel for Sean Abbott whose life can never be quite the same again.'

Bill Shorten called Phillip Hughes 'a fantastic team man' and 'a country boy who loved playing for his country'

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten talked of 'the country boy who loved playing for his country'.

He spoke of Phillip's 'brilliance and potential, the records he holds and the records he would have set'.

'Phillip Hughes had courage, resilience and an extraordinary work ethic. A fantastic team man, Phillip was deeply admired and respected by his opponents,' Mr Shorten said.

Speaker of the House, Bronwyn Bishop then called for a minute of silence in parliament to be observed by all representatives present.

Phillip Hughes' funeral will be held on Wednesday in home town, with his old high school expected to be packed by one of the biggest crowds to attend a memorial in many years.
