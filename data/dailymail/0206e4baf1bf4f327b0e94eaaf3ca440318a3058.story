A three-year-old boy has died from serious injuries after a house fire which also killed two teenagers.

Doctors were battling desperately to save the toddler's life at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol following yesterday's blaze in the Honiton area of Devon but he was pronounced dead this afternoon.

Earlier today a 17-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man who were also in the house at the time also died.

Tragic: A three-year-old boy and two teenagers have died in hospital following a fire at this family home

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said: 'It is with great 
sadness that police can now report that the three-year-old boy, who was 
taken to the specialist burns unit at Frenchay hospital, has today been 
pronounced deceased.

'Our thoughts are with the family at this time and the investigation to establish the cause of the fire is ongoing.'

Officers were alerted to the fire in 
Lee Close shortly before 8am and a total of five people were taken to 
the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital with the three-year-old later 
transferred to hospital in Bristol.

A six-year-old boy and a man in his 30s were also treated for smoke inhalation.

Seven members of one family and another person were in the property when the blaze broke out.

A police spokesman added: 'Next of kin have been informed.

'Our thoughts are with family at this time and the investigation to establish the cause of the fire is ongoing. At this time the police are not treating the matter as suspicious.'

Emergency services were called to the house in Lee Close, Honiton, shortly before 8am yesterday

Police have said an investigation is underway, although there was nothing to suggest the cause was suspicious

Neighbour Dave Joslin, a former firefighter, said he was woken up by the sound of fire engine sirens.

He
said: 'I looked out of my window and saw smoke billowing out of the 
upstairs window and thought, I hope no one's hurt. When I saw five fire 
engines outside, I knew it was serious.'

Chief
Superintendent Paul Davies, speaking from the scene, said: 'There is 
nothing to suggest the cause of the fire is suspicious. But now there is
a multi-agency approach to determine the cause.

'It is understood a family member in the house raised the alarm. The house is badly damaged.'

Mr Joslin said: 'From what I can see the fire was pretty extensive. The windows are completely out and it's pretty well blackened.

'There were five fire engines and five ambulances there at one stage. It was a shock looking out and seeing it this morning.

Police and fire investigation officers remained at the scene to carry out their inquiries

'You think, "blimey I do hope nobody's hurt" especially when I didn't hear anything. No explosions or anything like that. I just heard the fire engines going up.'

South Western Ambulance Service said they were called to the incident at 7.36am.

A spokesman said: 'The trust immediately dispatched a number of vehicles including one of the Devon air ambulances. Five ambulances and two officers were also promptly on scene, with the first vehicle arriving within four minutes.

'Members of the Hazardous Area Response Team (HART) were also in attendance. These highly trained paramedics have specialist equipment to deal with this type of situation.'

Neighbour Dave Joslin, a former firefighter, said he was woken up at about 7.30am to the sound of fire engine sirens

Police have said it was believed a family member raised the alarm
