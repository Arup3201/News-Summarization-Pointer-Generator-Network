They were once worshipped by the Aztecs for being food of the gods.

And now, hundreds of years later, chia seeds are revered once again as the latest ‘superfood’ trend.

Originally found in Mexico, the tiny seeds have been dubbed ‘the running food’ and hailed as the ‘ultimate superfood’ by athletes and health advocates.

They contain a wealth of antioxidants and minerals such as calcium and have higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids than salmon. Omega-3 has been shown to help protect against a range of illnesses including heart disease and dementia.

The seeds are also thought to help dieters as they contain few calories but are high in protein, making people feel full.

The craze has taken such a hold that Marks & Spencer has just launched a range of products – including bread and pitta – containing the ingredient to meet the rising demand. The chain’s nutritionist Helen Stevenson said: ‘Our customers are definitely becoming more aware of these hero health ingredients, and are actively looking for them.’

However, not everyone is convinced of their power. Tam Fry, a spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘I regard chia seeds as a bit of a fad, they are here today and will be gone in a week’s time and no one will remember them.’
