Hundreds of homes have been evacuated after the army was called in to carry out a controlled explosion of a 'suspicious' car that was doused in petrol.

Police were called to the silver BMW in the Fishponds area of Bristol at around 4am after they received information suggesting there was 'something in the car that was not safe'.

Officers were given an anonymous tip off from a member of
the public about the petrol-covered car - thought to be the result of a local
dispute.

Nearly 500 homes were evacuated, with residents sent to nearby schools and pubs, while a 200-metre cordon was put in place by the Royal Logistic Corps.

Safety: Police set up a 200-metre corden around the street after homes were evacuated in the early hours of this morning

Inspection: The bomb disposal lifts the boot of the BMW to make sure it is safe and secure

Operation: An Army bomb squad expert walks down the street where a 'suspicious' car was found

Bomb disposal experts carried out a 
number of controlled explosions on the car in Fishponds which the police
 feared could explode at any minute.

Avon and Somerset police said the incident could be linked to an 'ongoing dispute'.

Police have now arrested a suspect.

Mark Anderson, 43, said he was shocked when he was woken up at around 6am by a policeman knocking on his door.

He
 said: 'They told us they were evacuating the area because there was a 
car covered in petrol and the bomb disposal team was on its way.

'We got out of the house as quickly as we could. It's normally a quiet area.'

Teacher
 Sadie Pike, 34, who lives opposite the suspect car, said: 'We were told
 by police that a car was doused in petrol and we needed to evacuate.

'We go ourselves out as quickly as we could and then the bomb disposal team turned up about 40 minutes later.

'We don't know who the car belongs to.'

Speaking
 yesterday, Chief Superintendent Geoff Spicer said: 'I am very grateful 
to residents for their continued co-operation and patience.

Danger: Officers believe the car (circled), which was doused in petrol, is part of an on-going dispute

'Public safety is a priority for us and the exclusion area was set-up as a necessary precaution.

'We will be carrying out a full and thorough investigation into this incident now the controlled explosions have taken place.

'At
 this stage we believe this is an isolated incident and could be linked 
to an ongoing dispute and we are progressing lines of enquiry.

'The
 exclusion zone is likely to remain in place until at least 2pm today, 
so I would advise people to avoid the area, as there are road closures 
in place.'

Inspector Lee Moore added: 'We have asked the public to leave their homes as a precautionary measure.

'Those unwilling to leave their homes have been asked to stay inside and away from their homes.

'We had reports of a suspect vehicle and we need to make sure it is safe and secure.

Walk: More than 460 homes were evacuated as the bomb disposal expert carried out the explosion

Approach: He walks past a caravan with his equipment. The car has its doors open in the driveway

'Everyone has acted very calmly.'

Around 15 officers were yesterday afternoon still on scene.

Rest centres had been set up at the nearby Downend Tavern pub, Fishponds Police Station and the Christ Church Primary School.

Landlord of Downend Tavern, Danny Barker, kept locals warm and offered tea and coffee.

Danny, 32, said: 'I got a knock on the door around 7am and was told by police there was a bomb scare.

'They asked if they could use the pub for people who had been evacuated from their homes.

'I was happy to help and have been giving people free tea, coffee and soft drinks and somewhere safe and warm.

'There has been a real feeling of camaraderie between the local residents.'

Operation: The one-man bomb disposal unit returns to the police corden after dealing with the suspicious vehicle

Preparation: A police officer and paramedic speak to the solider before he carries out his duties

Meeting: A soldier speaks to the bomb disposal expert at the scene

Equipment: One resident shared a photo of the bomb disposal robot on Twitter
