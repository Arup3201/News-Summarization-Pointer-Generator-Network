A disgraced dentist who was struck off for conning the NHS out of £200,000 has been banned again for boasting about toilet sex sessions to a newly qualified dental nurse.

Shabbir Merchant, 44, told the 'shocked' nurse he was 'good with his hands' and bragged about groping women in toilet cubicles as the pair were working together at his surgery.

Merchant had claimed to be a reformed character when he returned to dentistry in 2009, less than three years after being jailed for 18-months for fraud.

The Ferrari-driving dentist was kicked out of the profession in 2006 after making a string of bogus claims for treatment of non-existent patients to fund his lavish lifestyle.

He submitted £200,000 worth of fake invoices to the NHS to fund a four-year spending spree which saw him splash out on property in London and Manchester and a fleet of luxury cars.

Now Merchant has been banned again for nine months after admitting a raft of fresh charges, including poor treatment of seven patients between September 2009 and June 2010.

He also admitted making suggestive comments to the dental nurse in February 2011, shortly after his marriage crumbled.

'Your use of inappropriate comments to a female colleague was completely unacceptable, and was compounded by the fact that you were in a professional setting, alone together and in close proximity', said General Dental Council panel chairman Lynne Stuart. 

'She felt shocked by the language you used and threatened by your close proximity to her during this conversation.'

Then employed at a Denture Care 
practice in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, Merchant claimed he had 'a lot of 
strange stories' to tell her before making a string of lewd boasts.

He
claimed he was 'disgustingly used by women' and recounted tales of 
being dragged into toilets by women before 'putting his hands down their
knickers'.

Ms Stuart added: 'You accepted that your conduct on this occasion was inappropriate, shameful and disgusting.'

When
the horrified nurse complained, Merchant tried to force her to withdraw
her statement by threatening to shame her in the Asian community.

He
sent her a letter on October 25 last year, saying: 'It's with great 
reluctance I may have to disclose further information about you, but I 
can't see any other option because I have to defend myself against the 
GDC.

'It is you and your family who have to live with the consequences of your actions.'

The
panel accepted Merchant was going through difficult personal 
circumstances at the time, including a divorce and the death of his 
father.

Struck off: A panel told Merchant his behaviour towards his female colleague while they were alone at the surgery in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, was 'completely unacceptable'

Merchant's original downfall came after he submitted false invoices for non-existent patients at his Bray Dental Practice in Adelaide Road, Swiss Cottage, in London, between May 1999 and August 2003.

He invented expensive treatments for nearly 200 patients, but suspicions were raised when the GDC spotted discrepancies in his paperwork.

In a bid to bolster his story, the dentist claimed his surgery was burgled and dental records stolen - even reporting the supposed break-in to the police.

He had in fact spent the money on building up a property portfolio of six homes and a fleet of sports cars including a Ferrari coupe and Porsche 911.

The dentist, then of London Road, Stanmore, Middlesex, was jailed for 18 months in 2006 after he admitted fraud charges totalling £197,997.78 at Southwark Crown Court.

But he served just four-and-a-half months in prison before being released.

Merchant was struck off by the GDC in July 2006, but convinced the regulator to let him work again in January 2009, subject to strict conditions of practice.

Restrictions on his work were finally lifted in February this year, just a month before he admitted the fresh allegations of misconduct.

'You have fully repaid your outstanding debt to the NHS since your release from prison', said Ms Stuart.

'It is not the committee's task to revisit your previous conviction and in the circumstances has attached little weight to it in all the circumstances.'

Merchant has admitted several incidents of shoddy work at Droitwich Spa Dental Practice, in Worcestershire.

He confessed to a string of bad clinical decisions, failing to record assessments and treatments, and not properly assessing the patients' needs, at the start of the two-week hearing.

Merchant admitted more of the charges during the hearing after expert evidence was given, and he was cleared of a handful of accusations about his work.

He also admitted trying to blackmail another former colleague into withdrawing allegations reported to the GDC.

Merchant, of Reydon Avenue, Leytonstone, east London, was issued with an immediate nine-month suspension, and will be subject to a review hearing before he can work as a dentist again.
