A Maine man stands accused of beating his high school sweetheart wife to death on Christmas Day.

Hilary Saenz, 29, was found dead by paramedics after husband Christopher Saenz, 30, called them to their home Christmas Day. The couple married in their teens and have two children together - they found their mother's lifeless body.

One neighbor told a local television station the violent man has a drug problem that likely led to the woman’s murder.

The children stayed at a neighbor's house while paramedics rushed to the Ellsworth home only to find the young mother dead, according to Bangor Daily.

Christmas will never be the same for that poor 12-year-old girl and her eight-year-old brother.

A subsequent autopsy found that Ms Saenz died from blunt force trauma, the paper said.

Mr Saenz was arrested and charged with murder, his children taken to relatives.

A long-time friend and neighbour of the couple told WLBZ of the man’s issues.

‘He struggled with, I guess, drugs his whole life,’ Chris Card told the station. ‘She never did anything like that – she didn’t drink, she didn’t smoke – and he took advantage of that.

‘She just kept taking him back.’

Mr Card described Ms Saenz as ‘a super mom… who always had a smile.’

The devoted woman worked two jobs to support her family, he added. 

‘I spoke to quite a few people, and the people who know him know what happened,’ said Mr Card, ‘we all know what happened.’

A Facebook page set up as a tribute to Ms Saenz is filled with an outpouring of grief for the murdered mother.

'No words can express my heartfelt sympathy for those that are left behind,' wrote one person.

A poem written by Ms Saenz's brother Chance was also posted.

''Cause there's holes in the floor of heaven and her tears are pourin down that's how you know she's watchin, wishing she could be here now. and sometimes if your lonely, just remember she can see,there's holes in the floor of heaven, and she's watchin over you and me.'

Coworkers of hers at a local Walmart also posted condolences.

'My heart and my prayers are with the family through this terrible tragic act. Hillary was such a sweetheart. I worked with her at walmart. always had a smile on her face and always there to help when even needed.'

Mr Saenz is due in court sometime this week, a remembrance service will be held Friday for his dead wife.
