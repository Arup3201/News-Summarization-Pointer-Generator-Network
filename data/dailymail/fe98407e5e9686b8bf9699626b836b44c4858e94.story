Porto have nothing to prove coming into their quarter-final first leg against Bayern Munich as the only undefeated side in the Champions League.

However Julen Lopetegui has warned his side has plenty of room to improve saying the team 'hasn't stopped growing'. 

When Lopetegui comes up against his former Barcelona team-mate Pep Guardiola, who the former goalkeeper labels  'a winner', at Dragao on Wednesday night, it will be a clash of the two most prolific scoring sides of the tournament so far.

'We come into this tie being able to enjoy what we have accomplished and aiming to give our best in both games, as we always do,' Lopetegui told Goal.com.

With a number of new players in the summer still meshing with the squad Porto have room for improvement

'Many new players arrived last summer, but we have our idea of playing and the team has worked very well since the beginning of the season.

'We started this project with great enthusiasm and the purpose of qualifying the team for the Champions League [from the playoffs]. From there, the team hasn't stopped growing - travelling on its own path.'

Porto were clinical in their last Champions League start breezing past Basle 4-0 to claim the last-16 tie 5-1 on aggregate, while Bayern demolished Shakhtar Donetsk 7-0 after a 0-0 first leg.

Porto's defence has also been up with the larger clubs with the lowest amount of chances coming against them as they've conceded five and scored 24 goals. 

Atletico Madrid, Monaco and Bayern are the only sides to have been more frugal.

Guardiola, a two-time Champions League winner with Barcelona and Super Cup winner with Bayern, showed his former fellow Spain squad member plenty of respect ahead of the match.

'It is an honour for me and I congratulate him already for Porto's great performances,' he said in Tuesday's press conference on Tuesday.

'Porto haven't lost a game in the Champions League this season and I'm happy to be facing Lopetegui.'
