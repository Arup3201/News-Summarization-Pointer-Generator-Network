Convicted sex offender Dave Lee Travis was unrepentant as he was spared jail – claiming a £1million investigation had failed to prove he was a ‘sexual predator’.

The disgraced DJ, 69, showed no remorse as he said his conviction for molesting a young researcher at the BBC had left him ‘mortified and disappointed’. He ignored calls for him to apologise to his victim.

In a defiant speech outside court Travis, who has called the case a celebrity witch-hunt, appeared to suggest the guilty verdict was the result of prosecution mud-slinging.

He said: ‘With millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money, thousands of hours of police resources, the judge accepted today that the Crown had failed to prove their case against me – namely that I was a sexual predator.

Dave Lee Travis and his wife Marianne arrive at Southwark Crown Court, where the former radio DJ was given a sentence of three months in prison suspended for two years

Travis was found guilty of groping a researcher in her 20s behind the scenes of the Mrs Merton Show

Travis (pictured leaving court) was found guilty of groping researcher's breasts for 10-15 seconds after he saw her smoking and said 'your poor little lungs' 

‘I have always worried, as have my close family and friends, that if the prosecution threw enough mud at me, some of it might stick.

‘While I am relieved I have been able to prove that I am not a sexual predator, I am mortified that I was convicted of one count. And it is of little comfort to me that I was acquitted of so many others.’

Former Top Of The Pops presenter Travis, who could have faced a maximum two-year jail sentence for indecent assault, was given a three-month sentence suspended for two years.

Judge Anthony Leonard, QC, told Southwark Crown Court Travis had taken advantage of his status as a ‘well-known media personality’ to molest the 22-year-old researcher on the Mrs Merton Show in the belief ‘she would not make a fuss’.

The woman, now a successful TV personality in her own right, said she was ‘subjected to an unprovoked and terrifying physical assault at my place of work’ which left her ‘paralysed with fear’.

Travis has protested his innocence throughout the trial and tried to dismiss other women who claimed they had been groped by him as ‘fantasists and liars’.

The Mrs Merton researcher said she had found suggestions that she was courting fame or seeking a financial pay-out particularly hurtful.

Speaking outside court, Travis said he was 'mortified' and 'disappointed' that he had been found guilty

He added: 'Those close to me, including my wife Marianne (right) who has been by my side the whole time, we all know the truth and I am grateful for that'

He also attacked his prosecution, which he said had cost the taxpayer 'millions' and used thousands of pounds of police resources

Judge Leonard said Travis had used his celebrity status and large frame to intimidate his victim. 

The victim told of her horror at the attack in an impact statement read to the court:

‘I was a naive and trusting 22-year-old when I was subjected to an unprovoked and terrifying physical assault at my place of work. 

'I was too paralysed with fear to confront my assailant but immediately told my boss.

‘I feel lucky, I was psychologically robust enough to deal with the distress, thanks largely to the support of my friends and colleagues.

‘I have coped by using humour as a defence mechanism. But remembering the incident still takes me back to feeling like a scared, vulnerable young woman. 

'Being called a liar and fantasist and being forced to relive the events of the past has been painful. I was particularly horrified at the defendant’s allegations that desire for attention or financial greed motivated me.

‘I have sought to preserve my anonymity and have no intention of claiming compensation now or in the future. I simply wanted to tell the truth and was prepared to go through this unpleasant process to that end.

‘I am grateful I have always been believed by those who know me, and the members of the jury also appreciated I was telling the truth.’

He told him: ‘At over 6ft tall you towered over her… You pinned her up against the wall and started to touch her rib cage and slid your hands up over her breasts and her clothes, and started squeezing them. You left your hands there for several seconds.

‘She said that, with you looming over her, she felt scared and when she got away she was shaking and a bit beside herself. She described her feeling of being violated.’

The BBC now faces being sued by a number of women who claim Travis assaulted them during his 30-year career with the corporation. He could also face civil law suits, including one from a woman who claims he attacked her when she was a ‘pre-teen’ in the 1970s.

Travis, who was tried under his real name David Griffin, was cleared earlier this year of 12 indecent assaults dating back to the mid-1970s, including an alleged assault on a 15-year-old girl.

That jury failed to reach verdicts on alleged attacks against two other women and prosecutors decided he should face a retrial on those charges plus a third count of indecent assault against the Mrs Merton researcher, who had come forward during his first trial but was too late to be added to the charges.

At the second trial he was convicted of that 1995 indecent assault, found not guilty of indecent assault on a second woman and the jury was hung on the other allegation, which was formally recorded as a not guilty verdict.

Travis, who was not ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register because the indecent assault was committed in 1995, before the register was introduced, left court hand-in-hand with his wife Marianne, 66.

Travis was first arrested in October 2012 under Operation Yewtree, Scotland Yard's £3million investigation into historic sexual abuse in the wake of allegations against the late DJ Jimmy Savile. 

Sentencing Travis, Judge Leonard said the DJ's offence was of a 'different order' to other high profile convictions under Operation Yewtree

Max Clifford was sentenced to eight years in jail after being convicted of eight counts of indecent assault as part of Operation Yewtree

Dave Lee Travis is the third celebrity scalp to be claimed by sex crime inquiry Operation Yewtree.

The 69-year-old was the fourth figure with links to the entertainment industry to be arrested as part of the investigation, which has now seen a total of 17 people questioned by police.

The operation came in for criticism after its first two attempted prosecutions, against Coronation Street actors William Roache and Michael Le Vell, both ended with not guilty verdicts.

However, in April this year the investigation secured its first conviction after Max Clifford was found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault on teenage girls, and sentenced to eight years in jail.

During the trial the prosecution claimed the celebrity kiss-and-tell publicist took pleasure in degrading teenagers after he promised to make them Bond girls or TV stars. 

Rolf Harris was the second celebrity figure to be convicted after he was found guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault in June.

He was jailed for five years for assaulting girls aged between seven and 19 over the course of three decades in the Sixties, Seventies, and Eighties.

On the first day of his trial, Harris put on a confident display - singing Jake The Peg and explaining how he invented the wobble board - but was eventually undone after admitting he had found one of his 13-year-old victims attractive. 

Entertainer Rolf Harris is also serving time behind bars after being found guilty of 12 indecent assaults

Operation Yewtree was launched in the wake of claims made against late DJ Jimmy Savile, who was exposed as one of the most prolific sex offenders in British history after an ITV documentary.

So far eight people - including comedians Jim Davidson and Freddie Starr - have been told that no further action will be taken against them, and another three, including broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, remain on police bail.

The other six have been charged. As well as the three convictions, former pop star Gary Glitter and ex-Radio One DJ Chris Denning are facing prosecution in separate cases. Driver David Smith was due to face trial but died before he could do so.
