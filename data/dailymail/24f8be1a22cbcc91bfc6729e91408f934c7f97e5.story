There's no doubt that this 1957 Maserati is a stunning car and it could be yours, if you have £2.5million to spare.

Wealthy bidders will get the chance to get their hands on the beautiful cream 1957 Maserati 150 GT Spider when it makes a one-off appearance and goes under the hammer in California.

Those keen to get behind the wheel of one of the world's rarest cars could have to shell out anything up to a staggering £2.5million when auctioneers expect the hammer to fall at the two day auction.

Incredibly rare: Wealthy bidders will get the chance to get their hands on this beautiful cream 1957 Maserati 150 GT Spider when it goes on auction

Until now the car was lovingly in the hands of a private collector in Europe but U.S. auctioneers Gooding and Company have taken hold of the Maserati and are expecting collectors and fans of specialist sports cars from the 1950s to be racing into the auction room.

The vintage beauty packs an amazing 195 brake horsepower but only topples the scales at 860kg so it's still nippy despite its 46-year-old two litre engine.

Three other vintage cars will also be joining the Maserati for the sale on the 18th and 19th January in Santa Monica, California.

Bidders will also see a 1938 Bugatti 57 C, a 1957 Mercedes- Benz Roadster and a 1965 Shelby 289 Cobra go up for sale.

The Maserati was originally designed as an A6GCS sports racing car and wowed the crowds during the 1954 racing season so is guaranteed to get hands raising in the auction room.

It was later modified into a second prototype, the Maserati 300 S and the result of the two is the 1957 Maserati 150 GT Spider.

It is one of the worlds rarest cars potential buyers could have to shell out anything up to a staggering £2.5million

Car specialist Steve Hart beautifully restored and rebuilt the convertible car so the lucky bidder will still be able to drive their new pride and joy which has been described as a ‘little rocket'.

The 46-year-old motor still proudly sports its original matching numbers engine, gearbox, Grand prix-type brakes and elegant Fantuzzi coachwork.

David Brynan, Specialist at Gooding & Company said: 'Unlike production cars, which have a track record and comparable sales, one-offs and prototypes make their own market.

'What I really admire about the Maserati 150 GT is its fascinating pedigree, a combination of the best competition and coach built features and its extraordinary originality.'

Marketing manager Katie Hellwig said: 'The Maserati 150 GT Spider we're offering is a one-off.

'It's a prototype so our auction represents a very special opportunity for collectors because we don't know when the car will be presented again publicly.'
