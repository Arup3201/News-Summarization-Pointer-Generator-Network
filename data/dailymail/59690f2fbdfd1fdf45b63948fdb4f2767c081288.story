Parents all over Britain are preparing to send their children back to school next week, and many of them will be breathing a sigh of relief after what has probably been an expensive summer.

Children of primary school age cost their parents an average of £1,109 each over the lengthiest holiday of the year, expenses that are spread over sunny luxuries such as holidays abroad, days out, entertainment, as well as extra food and petrol.

Taking into account the approximate 4.1 million primary and nursery school pupils in the UK, this has equated to around a £4.56 billion spend on British youngsters, according to research from a money saving website.

They may be small, but each primary school age child in the UK cost their parents £1,109 over the summer

Factoring in holidays abroad, days out, extra food and extra petrol, summer holidays add up

And that's before they've factored in the inevitable September spend of  new uniforms, stationery and all that accompanies the beginning of a new school term, according to researchers at Vouchercodespro.uk.

The website polled 2,898 parents of primary school pupils aged between 3-11 on how much they have spent this summer on such school holiday treats as a holiday, days out and entertainment.

The poll did not take into account such necessary costs as child care and normal grocery costs in order to gain a better insight into the added expense of summer months on families.

When asked if they would agree with the statement that the summer holidays this year have proven more of a financial strain than previous years, 68 per cent of parents responded yes.

Of the 32 per cent of parents who didn't agree with the statement, 73 per cent had chosen not to have a summer holiday this year, perhaps explaining why costs were not as high for them this year.

Average spending per child aged 3-11 in UK over summer holidays:

TOTAL: £1,109

Factoring cost for each child, parents said they spent £562 on summer holidays, £114 on days out within the UK, £128 on extra food, £163 on entertainment such as cinema trips and books, and £142 on extra petrol.

When totalled, these costs equate 
to an average of £1,109 spent on each child during the summer holidays.

The money saving site used this statistic and multiplied it by the 
current number of primary school pupils in the UK (4,114,000). Overall, 
the UK summer spend on luxuries from parents per child comes to just 
over £4.56 billion.

Spokesperson for the site, George Charles, said: 'As
part of our ongoing research into consumer spending habits, the team 
here decided to investigate just how much the summer holidays have cost 
the average parents of primary school children this year.

'With the high 
sum suggested from results, it could now be argued that the start of the
new school year just around the corner, the expenses involved in such 
purchases as a new uniform and stationary, may be somewhat of a problem 
for cash-strapped families.'
