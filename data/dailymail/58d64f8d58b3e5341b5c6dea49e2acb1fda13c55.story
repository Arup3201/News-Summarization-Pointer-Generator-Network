Daniel Vettori says it's 'pretty obvious' he'll play his last one-day international for New Zealand in Sunday's Cricket World Cup final.

Vettori flew from Melbourne with his team-mates on Wednesday to prepare for the final against the winner of Thursday's match between Australia and India in Sydney.

He will play his 295th one-dayer for New Zealand at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, 18 years and four days since he played his first.

Vettori made his debut for New Zealand against Sri Lanka in 1997, aged 18. He has since taken 305 wickets and scored more than 2,200 one-day runs and will retire, aged 36, as New Zealand's most-capped player.

Vettori said 'it's not what I'm thinking about. It's about enjoying the game, enjoying the build-up to a World Cup final.'

New Zealand booked their place in the MCG showpiece with a thrilling four-wicket victory over South Africa at Eden Park in Auckland.

The co-hosts have won all eight matches so far in the tournament on their way to the final. 

Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming heaped praise on current incumbent Brendon McCullum for leading the Kiwis into their first ever World Cup final. 

The Black Caps had on six previous occasions reached the last four, including twice under Fleming, but never made the final.

Fleming, one of New Zealand's most successful captains, knows the setbacks his country have endured in the global tournament and admitted his incredulity at their feat in his column on the International Cricket Council's website.

He said: 'There is a dream-like euphoria mixed with a pinch-me feeling of disbelief throughout the country, given the Black Caps' success in winning their way through to Melbourne and Sunday's final has finally smashed that World Cup glass ceiling by banishing all the years of semi-final heartaches.

'As a captain who suffered two of those heartaches, in 1999 and 2007, to see a New Zealand side playing with the freedom and quality that Brendon McCullum and his players are producing certainly warms the heart.'

Fleming, who played 111 Tests and 280 one-day internationals, knows their supporters will be outnumbered, whoever triumphs in the second semi-final, but hopes they can reproduce the form that has got them this far.

'It will be a tough one to negotiate,' he added. 'Either way, New Zealand will know they will face a crowd in which their own supporters will be in the minority by quite some margin.

'I am not sure it matters who McCullum's men end up playing because either opponent at this stage of the tournament will be top-notch.

'But the quality the Black Caps have produced has been exceptional time and time again in this tournament and I just hope they can do it once more on Sunday.

'And if they do then that is one dream I would happily never wake up from.'
