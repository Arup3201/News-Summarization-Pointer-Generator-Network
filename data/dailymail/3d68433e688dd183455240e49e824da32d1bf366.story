They say the camera never lies – and even in this early picture you can see she oozes star quality.

This remarkable photograph captures Karen Gillan’s first appearance in front of a television camera – courtesy of Girls Aloud star Nicola Roberts.

The girl band superstar spotted Miss Gillan’s talent long before Doctor Who producers, and headhunted the Scot from the catwalk to star in a TV show.

More importantly perhaps, the Inverness-born beauty – who was then a struggling student – actually got paid for her work.

The still, from documentary The Passions of Girls Aloud, was taken more than five years ago, shortly after Miss Gillan was seduced by the bright lights of London and moved south from her family home.

She had won a place at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts drama school on the BA (Hons) degree course, and like most  cash-strapped students, the star in the making needed to earn some money to survive.

With her striking looks, it was hardly surprising that Miss Gillan was soon scouted by a top London modelling agency and booked for assignments including appearances at London Fashion Week.

Leading designer Allegra Hicks was enthralled by Miss Gillan’s slender figure, long legs and stunning looks and used her prominently throughout her autumn/winter collection.

During one fashion show, Miss Gillan captured the eye of another stylish redhead, Nicola Roberts.

The pair boast remarkably similar features and delicate colouring.

At the time the singer had already achieved incredible success as a member of the all-female group Girls Aloud.

After 20 consecutive Top Ten singles, five albums and positive critical acclaim from an army of young teenagers, Miss Roberts was keen to put her entrepreneurial skills to the test.

She also wanted to combat the snide remarks made about her pale skin which she had endured during her early days in the spotlight.

The taunts she suffered left Miss Roberts severely depressed and on the verge of quitting her successful pop career to disappear into the background.

But Miss Roberts recognised that many other young women faced similar problems and decided to help by establishing a cosmetics collection.

The result was Dainty Doll, a make-up line created especially for girls with fair skin, and she chose Miss Gillan as one of the models for the brand.

The business venture would eventually lead the two redheads to develop a special bond – and provide a vital career break for the Scot.

The pop star invited Miss Gillan to appear in an episode of  ITV2 television documentary series The Passions of Girls Aloud, which charts her struggle to create her beauty range.

Since then, the pair have remained good friends as they have gone from strength to strength  professionally, with the unknown student becoming as much a household name as her mentor.

While the Girls Aloud star has returned to the fore to perform a series of sell-out concerts, Miss Gillan took on a starring role as a Doctor Who companion.

Now that her character Amy Pond has departed the sci-fi series in a blaze of glory, the 25-year-old is ready to seek international fame and fortune in Hollywood.

Although home in Scotland over the festive season, the actress will soon be heading back to Los Angeles and what promises to be a hugely exciting period in her life and film career.

Miss Gillan said: ‘I have a few things in the offing but I don’t want to give too much away at this stage.

'Hopefully things will work out really well for me, although it is still strange getting used to all that sunshine in LA.’
