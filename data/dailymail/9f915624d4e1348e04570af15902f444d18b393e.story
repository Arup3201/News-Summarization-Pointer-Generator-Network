New York's famous bronze bull is a mascot for Wall Street, but when it was dropped off by a guerrilla artist in the middle of the night 25 years ago, it was not quite so popular with traders.

The Charging Bull was created by Sicilian immigrant Arturo Di Modica.

He wanted his work to be a symbol of strength and hope after the 1987 stock market collapse.

Outrage: When the bull was removed, the next morning's New York Post, displayed a photo of it being carted away, reading: 'Bah, Humbug!' 'N.Y. Stock Exchange grinches can't bear Christmas-gift bull'

Idea: Artist Arturo Di Modica (pictured) stands in front of the Exchange this week. He wanted the bull to be a symbol of strength and hope after the 1987 stock market collapse

He spent $350,000 of his own money to create the three and a half ton beast in his Soho studio - it was designed to be a Christmas gift to the city.

After two years of work the casting was final and the final pieces were welded together - the slick, powerful-looking bull measured 18 feet long.

At 1 a.m. on Dec. 15, 1989, Di Modica, with the help of 30 friends and a rented crane, lifted his majestic artwork onto a flatbed truck, drove it to the financial district in Lower Manhattan and dropped it off.

He had cased the area the day before, selecting a prime site on the sidewalk in front of the New York Stock Exchange and meticulously timing the police officers' patrols to every eight minutes.

'It took us five minutes to drop it off and get out of there,' Di Modica recalled.

 He was so excited by his present that he stayed behind and watched as amazed workers discovered the massive crouching bull with big horns and flaring nostrils.

'It was love right away,' Di Modica, now 73, told MarketWatch. 

'They wanted to touch it, embrace it - it was beautiful. I stood there watching until about noon, when I took a break and went to lunch.'

But officials were not happy and they called police who either unwilling or unable to move it.

They were so desperate to remove it, that the exchange hired private contractors to pick it up and the statute was transferred to Queens.

Worldwide: The bull has gone global and replicas (left and right) have been made for several countries across the world including China

But the bull's mysterious arrival had already made headlines across America and indeed the world. 

The next morning's New York Post, displayed a photo of the bull being carted away, reading: 'Bah, Humbug!' 'N.Y. Stock Exchange grinches can't bear Christmas-gift bull.'

Di Modica could not bear the idea of his bull living its life out in the Queens and was determined to bring it back to Manhattan.

Di Modica says he spoke to the Richard Grasso, then president and chief operating officer at the NYSE,  who said the bull could return only if it a bear was made to sit alongside it.

'He wanted me to make a bear, too,' the artist said.

Lucky bull? How the S&P fared under the watchful guide of the Wall Street bull 

'I told him I was not going to do that - the bear means the market goes down, but I wanted to represent the city getting bigger, stronger, faster.' 

Di Modica paid for the bull to be brought back to Manhattan.

His website states: 'Thanks to then Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, Mayor Ed Koch and Arturo Piccolo of the Bowling Green Association, a permanent home was found for the Charging Bull close by at Bowling Green. 

'The Charging Bull stands there to this day, visited by millions of tourists, a talisman for Wall Street traders, and a source of pride for all New York City residents.' 

It now attracts tourists posing for photographs and investors superstitiously rubbing its horns for good luck.

The bull is now seen a symbolic for New Yorkers - it was even temporarily barricaded to protect it from Occupy Wall Street in 2011.

Di Modica told MarketWatch that when the market is down, people ask him why it is not working. 

'I tell them he's resting, he's tired, but he'll get back to it soon,' he said.
