She has gone from being a commoner to become the Duchess of Cambridge and will one day be our future Queen.

But aged just 11, Kate Middleton got an early taste of stratospheric social mobility - by playing Eliza Doolittle, a flower girl taught to pass herself off as a duchess.

Following footage last month of the Royal speaking in a cockney accent during the 1993 school production of My Fair Lady, a new home video showed the future Duchess showcasing her singing skills as she belts out Wouldn't It Be Loverly.

Dreaming of a better life: Kate as Eliza sings about hoping for a better life

Wearing a black shawl over a high-necked white blouse, Kate as Eliza sings about her hope for a better life.

While Eliza has simple wishes for 'one enormous chair' and 'a room somewhere', the real Kate now resides in Kensington Palace and no doubt dozens of chairs in her apartment with husband Prince William.

Earlier footage released last week featured the audience in 
fits of laughter as well-spoken Kate showed off a Cockney accent in the lead role.

In
 the musical, Professor Henry Higgins spends hours teaching the flower 
girl to change her voice so she can imitate a society lady after betting
 he could train her to pass as a duchess at an ambassador’s tea party.

In one scene, Kate is shown at an elocution lesson being taught how to say: ‘The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.’

Sharing the stage: Kate was surrounded by a large cast of her peers

In her fake East London accent, she replies, ‘The rine in spine sties minely in the pline,’ leading to much laughter.

Kate, who took part in the performance
 while at £15,000-a-year St Andrew’s School in Pangbourne, Berkshire, is
 said to have struggled with the Cockney accent at first, but ‘took to 
being a lady like a duck to water’.

In her final year at the prep school,

playing the lead female character, who is proposed to by a squire and 
told by a fortune-teller she will marry a rich man.

It
 is believed that Andrew was Kate's first schoolgirl crush more than 20 
years ago, when the pair appeared in a number of  productions together.

A friend told The Sun: 'Kate was very shy around him because she had a huge crush on him for years.'

After
 leaving St Andrew’s School she went to Marlborough College before 
meeting Prince William while studying at St Andrews University in 
Scotland.

They married in 2011 and had their first child Prince George in July last year.

But while she may have struggled with the accent, she took to being a lady like 'a duck to water'

Kate was said to be very shy around her co-star because she had 'a huge crush on him for years', a source said

My Fair Lady is a musical based upon George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion

She is one of the most famous commoners to become part of the monarchy.

She
 grew up in Bucklebury, Berkshire, where her parents, Michael and Carole
 Middleton, run a mail-order business selling toys and games for 
children’s parties.

The couple met when he was a flight dispatcher and she was an air stewardess both working for British Airways.

Sources confirmed last night that Prince William has opted out of the holiday this year as he is on a ten-week course at Cambridge University studying agricultural management

Before meeting Prince William, Kate Middleton reportedly took a fancy to the Downton Abbey actor while at school
