Dozens of flights were cancelled in central England today after a thick fog descended on much of the country.

The Met Office issued a severe weather warning this morning for regions including London and the South-East, the East and West Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber and the east of England.

And there are even reports that the UK could be facing snow later this week as the spell of unseasonably warm weather comes to an end.

Ten flights due to depart from London
City had also been cancelled, with services to Dublin, Rotterdam and 
Paris among those hit.

Bradford Airport earlier today has also been cancelled. The 6.20am KLM service had
been due to fly to Amsterdam, which has also been affected by fog.

Hundreds of passengers had their journeys disrupted last night as fog grounded flights at London airports.

At Heathrow, 132 flights, most of them short-haul, were cancelled and many others delayed. Officials warned that the poor visibility could continue for the first half of today.

London City Airport said 44 flights 
were suspended and dozens delayed or diverted due to the poor weather, 
though all restrictions had been lifted by late last night.

There were also severe delays at Gatwick, but officials said there were only a handful of cancellations.

The severe weather warning issued by the Met Office for this morning was lifted around ten o'clock and is no longer in place.

Yesterday saw winter finally start to 
bite, but temperatures will remain mild until Thursday when frosts and 
gale force winds of up to 60mph will set in, forecasters said.

And snow will hit the UK by the end of the week, according to the Met Office, who forecast that the Scottish Highlands are likely to see snow on Thursday or Friday.

Heavy fog delayed or cancelled around 58 inbound and 74 outbound flights at Heathrow, the worst affected airport.

All stranded passengers had been re-booked and would be put up in hotel accommodation overnight if necessary, said a spokesman.

Some domestic passengers were being taken to their destination by coach.

The airport was still open, and most 
flights did manage to take off and land, but air traffic controllers 
were restricting numbers for safety reasons, she said.

Clearing: Fog blows off the Houses of Parliament yesterday morning

Fog at the time: The capital's landmarks, including the London Eye, the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben rise out of the mist yesterday morning as the country woke to a chilly start to the day

On the roads, visibility was said to be less than 100 yards in some areas.

A man of 20 was killed after his car struck a garden wall in thick fog in Strood, Kent.

Two passengers were treated for minor 
injuries. The M25 was reduced to a 30mph zone as drivers struggled to 
get home. The Met Office last night issued weather warnings for dense 
fog for Yorkshire and Humberside,  the East and West Midlands,  the East
of England and the  South-East.

The next two or three days will be mild, up at 12c or even 14c, though cloud and some blustery showers are expected.

There was sunshine for many on 
Saturday as temperatures hit 15.9c in Otterbourne, Hampshire – warmer 
than June’s average peak temperatures of 15.4c.

Five weeks from Christmas, pub beer 
gardens had a busy weekend, shoppers in sunglasses hit high streets 
wearing light jumpers,  walkers enjoyed picnics amid glorious autumnal 
colours and families were even seen picking blackberries.

The weekend probably marks the end of an extraordinary six weeks of above-average temperatures.

From Thursday, they will dip to around
8c (46f) across the country, and close to zero at night, although there
is no sign yet of the heavy snow experienced last winter.

Met Office forecaster Steven Keates 
said: ‘Towards the end of the week it will definitely feel colder, 
particularly in the North.

‘Temperatures will be back to normal for this time of year.’

However forecasters said another freezing winter – which would be the third in a row – was unlikely.

Meanwhile, a mallard at London Wetland Centre has hatched a clutch of 11 ducklings, about six months later than usual.

The ducklings, which should have made
an appearance sometime between April and June, have been enjoying the 
winter sunshine. amid temperatures as high as 16C in some places.

The
latest that mallard ducklings would normally hatch is August, but that 
tends to happen when a clutch has failed and the adults try for a second
brood.

Nature's confused: This proud mallard has hatched 11 ducklings at London Wetland Centre six months later than normal thanks to the balmy conditions. The latest they would normally emerge is August
