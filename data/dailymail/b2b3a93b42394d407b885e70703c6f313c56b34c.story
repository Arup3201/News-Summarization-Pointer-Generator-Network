 

The only surviving ship from the First World War Gallipoli campaign is to be opened to the public for the first time thanks to £1.75million of lottery cash.

Portsmouth's National Museum of the Royal Navy has received the grant to restore HMS M.33 in time for the centenary commemorations next year.

The Gallipoli campaign, fought between April 1915 and January 1916 in what is now Turkey, claimed more than 500,000 lives of personnel.

Up close: It is a 'Monitor' ship which, at 568 tons and with a shallow draft, was able to get close in to shore and fire at targets on land

Project director Matthew Sheldon said: ‘HMS M.33 is a small ship but has a big history. It will be wonderful to open the ship to visitors next year.

‘Finally we'll be able to share the story of her part in the Gallipoli Campaign, and reveal what it was like for the 72 crew who were crammed on board.’

HMS M.33 is a 'Monitor' ship which, at 568 tons and with a shallow draft, was able to get close in to shore and fire at targets on land.

It carried two powerful and oversize 6in guns but has been described as ‘a basic metal box lacking in comforts’.

The museum said: ‘The 72 officers and men who sailed for the Gallipoli campaign were crammed inside and away from home for over three years.’

After the war in 1919, the M.33 was refitted and returned to action in the Russian Civil War.

Unique: The M.33 will be the only British warship from the First World War that will be open to the public

There, it covered the withdrawal of Allied and White Russian troops from north Russia during the Dvina River Campaign.

Following its return from Russia, the M.33 spent the rest of its active life in Portsmouth Harbour.

The M.33 will be the only British warship from the First World War that will be open to the public.

The project has received funding from Hampshire County Council to help meet the full £2.4million cost of the project.

The ship sits in No 1 Dock next to HMS Victory in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard and visitors will enter through a new entrance on board.

There will be an ‘immersive’ battle experience bringing to life the ship's history as well as the history of the Gallipoli Campaign.

Carole Souter, Heritage Lottery Fund chief executive, said: ‘The role of the Royal Navy in the First World War deserves to be much better known.

‘Now, thanks to lottery money, visitors to M.33 will be able to the learn more about the crucial part it played during the war, particularly at Gallipoli, alongside experiencing first-hand something of the conditions in which sailors lived and fought.’

Professor Dominic Tweddle, NMRN director-general, said: ‘Next year HMS M.33 will be the only British warship of the First World War that the public can get on board.

‘We are delighted that the Heritage Lottery Fund has made this grant to the NMRN to conserve and restore the ship.

'She will be a permanent commemoration and a reminder that the First World War took place at sea just as much as on land.’

The background to the Gallipoli landings was one of deadlock on the Western Front in 1915, when the British hoped to capture Constantinople.

The Russians were under threat from the Turks in the Caucasus and needed help, so the British decided to bombard and try to capture Gallipoli.

Located on the western coast of the Dardanelles, the British hoped by eventually getting to Constantinople that they would link up with the Russians.

The intention of this was to then knock Turkey out of the war. A naval attack began on February 19 but was called off after three battleships were sunk.

Then by the time of another landing on April 25, the Turks had been given time to prepare better fortifications and increased their armies sixfold.

Australian and New Zealand troops won a bridgehead at Anzac Cove as the British aimed to land at five points in Cape Helles - but only managed three.

The British still required reinforcements in these areas and the Turkish were able to bring extra troops onto the peninsula to better defend themselves.

A standstill continued through the summer in hot and filthy conditions, and the campaign was eventually ended by the War Council in winter 1915.

The invasion had been intended to knock Turkey out of the war, but in the end it only gave the Russians some breathing space from the Turks.

Turkey lost around 300,000 men and the Allies had 214,000 killed in a disastrous campaign. 

Anzac Cove became a focus for Australasian pride after forces were stuck there in squalid conditions for eight months, defending it from the Turks.

The Anzac soldiers who arrived on the narrow strip of beach were faced with a difficult environment of steep cliffs and ridges - and almost daily shelling.

At the height of the fighting during the landings of April 25, 1915, the waters around the peninsula were stained red with blood at one point 150ft out.

Fierce resistance from the under-rated Ottoman forces, inhospitable terrain and bungled planning spelt disaster for the campaign.
