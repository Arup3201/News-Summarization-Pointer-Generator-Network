President Barack Obama slammed the NFL as an 'old boys network' that has so far failed to send a clear message condemning domestic violence in an interview on Friday. 

He said the league needs a 'wake up call' as it was 'behind the curve' reacting to the footage of Ray Rice punching his then-fiancee, now wife, unconscious.

And if there is going to be a change in attitude, he said, it needs to start in college football where 'blind spots are rooted' and 'certain behaviors have been tolerated'.

'Old boys network': President Obama said the NFL needs to send a clear message about domestic violence

'You don’t want to be winging it when something like this happens,' Obama told ESPN's Colin Cowherd. 'You want to have clear policies in place.

'There has been a little bit of an old boys network in terms of how it operates. 

'There have been some blind spots that are rooted not just in pro football but dating back to college football and certain behaviors have been tolerated historically that really should not have been tolerated. 

'Hopefully this is a wake-up call.'

Obama's comments came in an interview about politics in sport with ESPN, during which he plugged his health care law.

'Behind the curve': The president said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has been slow to react to the cases

'Wake up call': He addressed the case of Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice who punched unconscious his then-fiancee, now wife, Janay Palmer (both picture). Obama said it should act as a 'wake up call' for the NFL

Asked whether NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell had 'too many men' around him, the president said all leaders have a duty to promote women and ethnic minorities to senior levels.

But he voiced his support for the policies that are now being tabled to address athletes' off-the-field behavior.

Earlier this week NFL owners unanimously voted for a new personal conduct policy to be put in place.

Among the changes, unveiled in Irving, Texas, on Wednesday, are a 'more extensive' list of prohibited conduct and NFL-funded counseling and services for victims, families, and violators.

An exterior body will invigilate, the statement said.  

Obama also addressed sports players who have used their position to make political statements about the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner.

Another case: The league's reputation was also hampered by the case of Minnesota Vikings' Adrian Peterson who has admitted to hitting his son with a switch

LeBron James, for example, warmed up for last week's Cavaliers v Nets game in a t-shirt that read 'I Can't Breathe' - the last words of father-of-six Eric Garner who was killed in a police chokehold, and whose killer has avoided indictment.

It comes after six St Louis Rams players walked on to the pitch with their hands in the air - a reference to 18-year-old Michael Brown who was claimed to have raised his hands before officer Darren Wilson shot him dead.

Obama noted that athletes are citizens as well as entertainers and have a right to make their feelings known.

'Some of our greatest sports heroes – Muhammad Ali, Bill Russell, Arthur Ashe – they spoke out on issues that mattered at pretty critical times,' he added.
