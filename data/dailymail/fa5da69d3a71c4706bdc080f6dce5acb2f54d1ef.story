Nick Clegg wanted the negotiations which set up the Coalition to last for ‘weeks’, a book reveals.

The Lib Dem leader spent five agonising days in talks with Labour and the Tories following the 2010 election – before striking a deal to govern with David Cameron.

But Lord Adonis, a former Labour minister who was present during the final days of Gordon Brown’s government, reveals Mr Clegg was willing to leave the country in limbo for far longer because that was what happened ‘in other democracies’.

Tipping the balance: Nick Clegg spent five agonising days in talks with Labour and the Tories following the 2010 election ¿ before striking a deal to govern with David Cameron

In extracts from a book detailing the fraught period after the election, he tells of turmoil after Labour and the Tories failed to achieve an overall majority.

This left the Lib Dems with the power to forge an alliance.

Extraordinary scenes followed as Mr Brown and Mr Cameron’s teams tried to strike a deal.

Mr Brown had already made Mr Clegg an offer, promising he would stand down within 18 months, Lord Adonis said.

But he claims Mr Clegg kept playing for time and often failed to telephone Mr Brown at  agreed times.

This is despite the fact other Lib Dem grandees, including Vince Cable and Ming Campbell, had already told senior Labour party figures the game was up and a coalition was being forged with the Tories.

When Mr Clegg received a call late on May 11 from Mr Brown saying they had to make a deal immediately or he would have to resign, Mr Clegg said: ‘No Gordon. Today is Tuesday. We have only just started the talks.’

Mr Clegg revealed he was seeking to ‘push the Conservatives on Europe’, hinting he was unhappy with their insistence that Britain needed to rethink its relationship with the EU.

‘We need some sanity on Europe. We can’t seek to renegotiate,’ said Mr Clegg.

When Mr Brown insisted he could not be seen ‘clinging on to power’ any longer, Mr Clegg said: ‘We have not rejected you. We are trying to play our role, to find a stable coalition. In other democracies trying to do this takes weeks. It’s quite right for us to do it methodically.’

Mr Brown gave him five more minutes to make up his mind before Mr Clegg rang back wanting more discussions, urging him ‘please, please don’t resign’.

Lord Adonis said Mr Clegg’s key concern ‘remained Europe’ and he begged Mr Brown for more time, saying: ‘You are holding me hostage.’

But Mr Brown insisted: ‘I can’t delay. I’ve got to resign now. Nick I need to go to the Palace.

‘You’re a good man, Nick. I’ve got to go now.’

The Five Days in May book reveals Mr Brown was so keen to cut a deal he wanted 30 would-be Labour MPs to stand down before the election in seats Lib Dems might win.

And his account also details the surreal moment Mr Brown’s hairdresser arrived to give him his weekly trim just as the talks were collapsing.

‘It’s turning into rather a big day,’ Mr Brown told her.

Lord Adonis accuses former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown of poisoning coalition talks by telling the press Mr Brown’s first phone call with Nick Clegg went badly, when he claims it was ‘workmanlike and civil’.

When Lord Adonis spoke to Lord Ashdown they discussed when Mr Brown would step down, with the latter saying he had to go to avoid jibes about ‘another unelected prime minister’.

But Lord Ashdown said this would not matter if it was David Miliband leading the party. He added: ‘Nor if it is his brother [Ed Miliband], though he’s the second best.’

As he was drafting the traditional note to welcome the new PM, Lord Adonis said Mr Brown called Tony Blair and said: ‘I am sorry we fell out; I know it could have been better.’
