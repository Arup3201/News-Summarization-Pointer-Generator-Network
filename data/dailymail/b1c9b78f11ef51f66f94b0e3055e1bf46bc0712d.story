Dog breeder Lisa Walsh, 47, from Barnham Broom near Norwich, is facing jail after claiming her puppies were Kennel Club registered

A dog breeder is facing jail after she admitted cheating pet owners out of more than £171,000 by claiming her puppies were Kennel Club registered and had clean health records.

Lisa Walsh, 47, operated her dog breeding scam from a number of addresses, including Greenacres Farm in Tasburgh, Norfolk.

Walsh, from Barnham Broom, near Norwich, duped customers into paying an average of £500 per dog, the court heard.

The single mother had over £43,000 stashed in a building society account when she was arrested.

Walsh also falsified paperwork declaring puppies had been inoculated against deadly diseases such as parvovirus when they had not.

The health and wellbeing of dogs was an 'irrelevance' to her as she focused purely on making money out of the con, Norwich Crown Court was told.

David Wilson, prosecuting on behalf of Norfolk Trading Standards, said some of the puppies bought from Walsh were vomiting and had diarrhoea when the new owners took them home. Others also suffered health problems.

Walsh sold one Labrador puppy which needed a £5,000 operation on its hip and another had to be put down after it contracted parvovirus.

Mr Wilson said outraged pet owners would not have gone to her in the first place if they had known the brutal truth.

Walsh had denied participating in a fraudulent business between September 2009 and October 2012.

But she changed her plea to guilty on the third day of what was to be a four-week trial.

At an earlier hearing, Walsh admitted two allegations of fraud in making false representations that the puppies had been vaccinated.

Judge Anthony Bate said trading standards officers had shown she had pocketed about £171,000. and could face jail.

But he said the sentence could be suspended as she was a single parent with a child with special needs.

Walsh began to cheat clients after her husband died in 2009, the court heard.

Walsh also bought in litters from other sources - then claimed she bred them herself. She would also register extra puppies that did not exist to generate 'phantom' paperwork.

And when Walsh did not own an adult of the same breed to show as the mother she told buyers the mothers had died giving birth.

She spun the same lie about three separate broods of West Highland Terriers and a litter of Cocker Spaniels.

Norfolk Trading Standards launched an investigation after a string of complaints and Walsh was arrested in April 2012.

Last night a trading standards spokesman said: 'We are pleased that Lisa Walsh has pleaded guilty to these charges.

'It is a very good outcome for what has been a long, detailed and complex investigation by our trading standards officers.

'It’s also a very good outcome for the many people who were deceived by her.'

Walsh's sentencing was adjourned for reports and a date is yet to be set.
