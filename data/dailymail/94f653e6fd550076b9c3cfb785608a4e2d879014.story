He has a loyal band of followers, especially among supporters of his pro-gun policies, but Republican candidate Thomas C. Foley has lost a few votes among the residents of his hometown.

A long-running controversy over the 'disappearance' of a nature island from the lake by his mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut, continues to haunt the GOP nominee, who goes by Tom Foley.

The mysterious vanishing act of the quarter-acre island occurred in 2003 but has remained a sore spot for locals in the well-to-do area.

According to The Stamford Advocate, Foley was the force behind the major $1.5 million dredging of Khakum Wood Lake.

His sprawling home is one of eight built around the man-made lake, which Foley thought had become overgrown.

The dredging was to stop it from becoming a swampland.

However when the water was drained, the island - a bird-nesting area over-run with red maple trees and a popular picnic spot - subsequently collapsed.

'It was a beautiful island, honestly,' a source told The Stamford Advocate.

'They did not have permission to remove the island.'

Neither Foley nor anyone else was found to be at fault for what happened.

It was determined the collapse was accidental.

'We've never really found anything specious,' said the director of the town's Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency, Michael Chambers.

'He is not the guilty party.

'To my recollection, everything was done by the book.'

Chambers said that they looked into building another island.

Some thought Foley should have to pay for it.

However it was decided it would it might be too harmful to the local environmen.

'This isn't Dubai,' Chambers said.

'We're not going to make someone build an island.'

Foley has not commented on what happened to the lake.
