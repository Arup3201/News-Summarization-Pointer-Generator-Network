These dramatic photographs capture the moment seven unexploded shells were detonated out at sea.

The 40lb shells, which are believed to date from the 1860s, were sniffed out by a black Labrador named after Sir Barnes Wallis - the inventor of the bouncing bomb.

His owner, John Brewin, phoned the emergency services after his dog dug up one of the shells during a walk in Sandwich Bay, Kent, on Sunday.

Sniffed out: Barnes Wallis the black Labrador

Experts from the Royal Logistics Corps Bomb Disposal Team arrived and, with Barnes' help, uncovered another six shells. 

They were taken out into the sea where they were safely detonated.

Mr Brewin said it was not the first time his dog had found explosives. 

He said: 'These are not the first he has found.'

'The seven shells date from the 1860s and are 40lb Black Powder shells.

'The first one was found by my black Labrador Barnes Wallis and the others were then located by the local Coastguard Team, assisted by Barnes again.'

Mr Brewin named his dog after Sir Barnes Wallis, a British aviation engineer who invented the 'bouncing bomb' used in the Dambusters Raid of 1943. 

Adrian Hendry, 43, who lives nearby, said: 'The explosion out at sea was incredible - a real blast.

'It's amazing that the dog that sniffed the bombs out is named after Barnes Wallis - an amazing coincidence really.'

Sir Barnes Wallis: Inventor of the 'bouncing bomb'

Barnes Wallis was a British aviation engineer who is famous for designing the 'bouncing bomb' that was used in the Dambusters Raid of 1943.

Born in Derbyshire, Wallis worked first as for a marine engineering firm before transferring to working on aircraft. 

When the Second World War began, Wallis was assistant chief designer of aviation at Vickers' engineering.

He came up with the concept behind the bouncing bomb while skipping his daughter's marbles across a tub of water by catapault. 

But it took more than a year to convince RAF chiefs that such a bomb might work and should be attempted. 

Once he was given the go-ahead, he had only eight weeks to complete and test the design. 

The final solution, called Upkeep, was a cylindrical bomb, weighing four tons, spinning backwards at 500 rpm.

It had to be dropped from precisely 60ft above the water at not more than 240mph. In the dark. In the middle of hilly, forested west German territory.

Operation Chastise, dubbed the 'Dambusters Raid' was carried out overnight on the 16 May 1943 by the 617 Squadron of the RAF - specially-created for the job - that was led by Guy Gibson. 

Two of the dams were breached, leading to serious flooding of the surrounding area. However, it did not make a significant dent in the country's industrial production, as hoped. 

The most significant outcome of the raid was the positive effect it had on morale - giving Allied troops, and those left at home, a much-needed boost.
