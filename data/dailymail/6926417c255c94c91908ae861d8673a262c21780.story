FIFA has revealed that all 800 players who have given samples during its World Cup doping programme so far have been clean.

Football's world governing body also says players chosen for samples after the first nine matches tested negative.

The figures include samples from 91 per cent of players who were chosen in the 30-man preliminary squads for the 32 teams.

Clear: Doping samples for 800 players at the World Cup have tested negative so far

Focus: The football and not doping has dominated the headlines due to the lack of positive tests

FIFA reported no problems getting blood and urine samples to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) laboratory in Switzerland.

Jiri Dvorak, FIFA's chief medical officer, said: '(It) all worked well, including the transport from Manaus.'

Italy beat England 2-1 in the remote Amazon jungle city on Saturday and samples were able to be provided without delay despite the difficulty in transporting in and out of the area.

Dvorak continued: 'All samples arrived (in) under 36 hours to Lausanne and were processed within 24 hours.'

WADA revoked the Rio de Janeiro laboratory's accreditation last year due to non-compliance, but there have so far been no such problems during the World Cup.
