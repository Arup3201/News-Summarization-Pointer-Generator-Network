An electronic cigarette is believed to have sparked a fire at a flat, after it exploded while on charge.

Fire chiefs investigating the blaze at the apartment in Barking, in East London, said they believe the device could have overheated while it was plugged into a mains socket.

Four fire engines and 21 firefighters rescued a woman from the ground floor flat shortly after 3.30pm on Saturday, and she was taken to hospital by ambulance with smoke inhalation and shock.

An electronic cigarette is believed to have sparked a fire at a flat, after it exploded while on charge. Fire chiefs investigating the blaze at the apartment in Barking, in East London, said they believe the device could have overheated while it was plugged into a mains socket

A large section of the ground floor flat was damaged by the fire.

It comes after 65-year-old Jean Booth was left fighting for her life after she is believed to have used an e-cigarette while she was on oxygen in a Manchester hospital bed.

In the early hours of Friday morning the pensioner was engulfed in flames on a ward at the Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester, and is now fighting for her life after suffering severe burns to her scalp and face.

Mrs Booth was only in the hospital for a routine hip operation and hospital chiefs are investigating how the incident occurred in the early hours of Friday morning.

A spokesman for the hospital said last night: ‘We can confirm that an incident involving one patient in our care took place in the early hours of Friday.’

It comes just two weeks after an e-cigarette exploded in a barmaid's face while it was being charged near the bar of a pub in Richmond, North Yorkshire. Laura Baty, 18, managed to quickly turn away from the flames  - but was left with a burnt dress and a singed arm.

Charlie Pugsley, from the London Fire Brigade Fire Investigation Team, said: 'People assume e-cigarettes are much safer than ordinary cigarettes, and in most cases they are.

'The danger is that people sometimes use incorrect chargers which runs the risk of over-charging, which can potentially have explosive results.

Last week, barmaid Laura Baty, was burnt when her e-cigarette exploded while it was charging

Around 1.3million people in the UK are thought to use e-cigarettes as consumers look for 'healthier' ways to continue smoking

'We are calling on e-cig retailers to ensure they are selling the correct chargers for the cigarettes.

'As with all rechargeable electrical equipment, it's vitally important that people use the correct type of charger for their e-cigs to prevent fires which can be serious and could even result in death.'

The London Fire Brigade said that people should never leave items like e-cigarettes on charge over night or when they're sleeping.

They also highlighted safety concerns over people lighting cigarettes when using oxygen cylinders for lung conditions.

It said people should never smoke or use naked flames near oxygen equipment as cylinders can explode when exposed to heat.
