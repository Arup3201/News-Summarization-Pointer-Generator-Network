‘Closet NFL fan’ Joey Barton thinks the demand for International Series tickets and the passion displayed by UK American football fans are enough evidence to suggest that England is ready for a franchise.

Ahead of the latest NFL regular-season game at Wembley between Atlanta and Detroit on Sunday, the QPR midfielder joined Falcons running back Steven Jackson and Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh for an event at NikeTown in Oxford Circus on Tuesday.

American football fans attended for a question and answer session hosted by Vernon Kay in which the players discussed the different training and preparation methods used by both sports.

Barton now admits to being ‘hooked’ on NFL and thinks the English fans have demonstrated that they’re ready for a team of their own.

He told Sportsmail: ‘I think there’s a demand for it. There is a stadium here that I think they would sell out if they were a good enough team.

‘The difficulty would be flying about, but it’s probably just as easy to fly from New York to London as it is to fly from New York to Los Angeles.

Barton admitted to being a 'closet NFL fan'

‘Seeing the Wembley games and how much more frequent they have become, you certainly see the passion when the tickets sell out as quickly as they do.

‘I went to the first game this season between the Dolphins and the Raiders and seeing how passionate the fans were and all the different jerseys on show, I think there’s a really emerging market for it here.’ 

Atlanta’s clash with Detroit at Wembley on Sunday will be the 10th regular-season game in England since the International Series began in 2007 and is once again a sell-out.

Barton’s interest in American football came from reading up on the sport before slowly gaining an understanding of the game and picking up the rules. 

He said: ‘I have been a closet NFL fan for a number of years. I’m a New York Giants fan and I’m a big fan of Eli Manning. I like the way he plays the game and he’s got a carefree attitude.

‘I’m also a fan of (coach) Tom Coughlin. I’ve read a lot of books by a lot of different NFL coaches, along with Bill Walsh’s book I think Coughlin’s was very informative.

‘I got into NFL that way – watching it without really understanding the rules and then the more I watched it the more I understood the rules.

‘My interest in it grew from there once I knew the rules and what was going on. You delve into it further and further and before you know it you’re hooked.’

Ndamukong Suh, Steven Jackson and Joey Barton were at NikeTown London as part of the 'Suit up for Sunday' campaign and ahead of the second 2014 NFL International Series game. This Sunday the Atlanta Falcons will take on the Detroit Lions at Wembley Stadium.
