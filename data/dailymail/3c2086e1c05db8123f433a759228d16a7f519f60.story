Durham followed by St James’s Park in central London enjoyed the hottest weather, while South Wales, Dorset, Exeter and Bournemouth peaked at between 21C (70F) and 22C (72F).

Forecasters have predicted the weekend
will stay dry and sunny, with temperatures today set to reach a maximum
of 20C (68F) before cooling slightly on Sunday.

The warmest weather will be in the South but much of the country can expect to enjoy a BBQ weekend.

Yesterday the glorious sunshine meant 
children on half-term holidays were out tucking into ice cream in parks,

from Surrey, said: ‘It’s absolutely beautiful weather. I had a champagne
breakfast in the sunshine.’

However, temperatures failed to beat the current 2013 record of 23.8C (75F), recorded in Drumburgh in Cumbria on May 7.

James Wilby, a forecaster for 
MeteoGroup, said: ‘The best of the sunshine will be on Saturday, 
especially in the central and southern parts of England.

‘Sunday will start of well but will become cloudy as the day goes on.

Spring on record and the coldest since 1962. Each of the last three
