Police investigating Jill Dando's murder failed to act on death threats made to her TV colleague just weeks before the Crimewatch star was murdered.

BBC host Alice Beer has revealed she was targeted by the same person who threatened to rape and kidnap her and Miss Dando in letters sent to the corporation.

The letters were passed on to police but the presenter said that officers never spoke to her about them - even after Miss Dando was shot dead outside her home in Fulham, west London, in April 1999.

BBC host Alice Beer has revealed she was targeted by the same person who threatened to rape and kidnap her and Jill Dando in letters sent to the corporation 

The letters were passed on to police but the presenter said that officers never spoke to her about them - even after Miss Dando was shot dead outside her home in Fulham, west London, in April 1999

She told the Sunday Mirror that fellow BBC star Anne Robinson received a death threat just three days after her murder.  

She said: 'I waited for a call from the police after Jill's death – but it never came. Nobody spoke to me about the threat.

'Nobody questioned anything. If no stone were left unturned in that investigation then I would have been called.'

Barry George, of Fulham, was initially convicted in July 2001 but was acquitted of killing the 37-year-old presenter at a retrial in August 2008. 

Ms Beer, worked alongside Miss Dando on the BBC's Children in Need and Holiday shows, and is now a presenter on ITV's This Morning.

She was working on BBC consumer programme Watchdog when she received the threats in March 1999, the paper said.

Her colleague on the show, Anne Robinson, received a death threat by phone three days after the killing, which according to the paper said: 'From Serbia, going to kill Anne Robinson, Alice Beer and two others.'

Ms Beer said she believed her threat was penned by the same perpetrator that threatened Miss Dando.

She said: 'The letters were in the same handwriting from a person claiming they wanted to capture and rape us. Mine was in amongst my mail at the BBC. My letter was handed over to the police via the programme editors or the management of the BBC.

'I was told Jill Dando had had a similar letter in the same handwriting and the local Shepherd's Bush police were investigating.'

The murder had been a 'slick' and 'professional' operation, she added.

A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: 'The Metropolitan Police Service fully investigated the circumstances into the murder of Jill Dando. Two trials took place and the investigation was subject to an internal review.

'If any new information comes to our attention then this will be investigated.'
