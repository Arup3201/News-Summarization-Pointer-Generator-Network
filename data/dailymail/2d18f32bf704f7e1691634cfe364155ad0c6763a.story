Owners of a fish and chip shop have made some mammoth fries after a sack of giant potatoes were delivered to the takeaway - some measuring up to a foot long.

Jonathan Noblett, the owner of Noblett's chip shop in Preston, Lancashire, said: 'We get fresh spuds every day, and in this particular bag there were the biggest potatoes I've ever seen.

'Some were a foot long. I noticed as soon as I opened the bag.'

Mr Noblett, said once he seen the giant potatoes he had to try and deep fry them to make the ultimate chip

The potatoes came from the Four Fields Farm in Pilling, Preston in Lancashire 

He said: 'As they were coming out I was thinking I've never seen anything like this before in my life.'

The chip shop uses potatoes from Four Fields Farm in Pilling, Preston, Lancashire.

Mr Noblett said: 'We had customers commenting saying they had never seen anything like it.

'We made chips out of them and they were massive.'

Farmer Arnold Ronson said: 'We usually get them quite big most years with this particular variety, arcade.

'We thought they would be small this year with it being dry, because they need a bit of water.

'But they must have had just the right amount of water at the right time. It's been a good crop.

'The big potatoes keep jamming up the machine that weighs and bags the spuds.' 

The giant potatoes were 'arcades' and grew to a giant size this year despite a relatively dry summer
