A veteran has finally received his Second World War medals – at the age of 91.

William Ferridge never found the time to request them when he finished military service in 1946.

But 68 years later, close friends applied on his behalf, and he was awarded them at a special ceremony last week.

Second World War veteran William Ferridge has finally received his war medals at the age of 91

Mr Ferridge, from Waterlooville, Hampshire, was a lance corporal with the Royal Corps of Signals and provided battle communications during the war.

His medals included the Italy Star, the Africa Star, the Defence Medal and the War Medal.

Speaking at the ceremony in Havant, near Portsmouth, he said: ‘I had just been married when I left the service and had to get a job and earn a living.

'I never got round to applying for my medals – life got in the way. So, this was a big surprise, but a very nice one.’

The presentation comes just weeks after world leaders gathered in Normandy to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 1944.

Veterans saluted on the beaches at dawn and downed Calvados at 6.30am - the moment the landings started.

During the poignant event, the Queen met veterans and saluted the 'immense and heroic' endeavour of them and their comrades 70 years ago.

Barack Obama spoke at a U.S. war cemetery and told how 150,000 fought at time of 'maximum peril for the world'.

For many veterans, now in their 80s and 90s, it may have been their annual pilgrimage to honour fallen troops.
