Ollie Proudlock is the much-loved Made In Chelsea style guru who put
crucifix earrings, man buns and Hawaiian shirts on the fashion radar.

And now, the 
25-year-old with a penchant for top knots has landed himself a modelling contract with top agency, Elite Model Management, joining their special bookings division.

Speaking to MailOnline, the ever humble fashion designer and reality TV 
star said: 'I don’t see it as 
just a modelling contract; it’s more about building the relationship 
with Elite London: focusing on fashion and creativity.

'It’s great to be involved in photo-shoots and developing my creative portfolio along the way. Elite is the biggest international modelling network so it is exciting to be on board with them.'

Ollie, who uploads snaps of himself to his style blog, Proudlock Style, admits he never gets camera shy.

He said: 'While modelling was never my main intention, my mum is a photographer and she always took loads of photos of my family and I, putting on mini photo-shoots whilst we were on holiday so I have been used to the camera from an early age, which is fortunate for where I am now.'

Edgy: As well as shooting with them, Ollie is an ambassador for the Elite Model Look UK, which scouts talent

Sharing his top tips for perfecting his pose, Prooderz - as he is affectionately known amongst his co-stars - said: 'For me, the key is to try to be as 
natural as possible and attempt to show variation. I’m not a trained 
model so I take direction wherever possible.'

Proudlock's bun may have become the butt of all jokes between his Made In Chelsea co-stars but, as man buns - or muns - become the hottest hair accessory, who's laughing now?

'It’s funny because at the beginning it was really alien to a lot of people and I had a very mixed reaction. It’s fun seeing people out and about sporting the "mun".

'The best person to pull it off so far is my Mini Proudlock from the #MiniChelsea advert. He looks epic.'

I would recommend investing in:

A pair of
 Tom Davies bespoke sunglasses

The Serge DeNimes Yellow Gold Padlock 
Pendant

Christies Kingsbury fedora

'I am big on accessories at any 
time of the year but these are perfect for sunny days'

Unlike a lot of his MIC pals who have been tottering up and down the King's Road and partying at Boujis until the tiny hours, Ollie has been building a brand - he has his own fashion range, Serge DeNimes, jewellery lines and has just collaborated with Gandy's to design a pair of flip-flops for charity.

'It’s a really exciting year ahead for Serge DeNimes, with the Gandys collaboration and another which we are yet to announce; we are also launching in five Harvey Nichols stores in May with an exclusive capsule collection.

'In addition we have just released our first Serge Life Style video: #LiveSerge, which we intend to continue monthly, acting as a platform for young creatives.

'I am hoping that I will be filming in New York for the summer for a six-episode Made in Chelsea special; it’s a really big step for the show.

'If not I will be around London working on some exciting things for Serge DeNimes and of course building my portfolio with Elite London.

'We’ve had a hectic filming 
schedule, I think this is the best season yet with new characters and 
some huge reveals that we didn’t see coming so the viewer’s certainly 
won’t,' he reveals.

Hilarious! The new trailer for the upcoming 
seventh series of Made In Chelsea sees the cast - pictured here Oliver 
Proudlock and Jamie Laing - depicted as child versions of themselves and Ollie says his mini-mi has the best man bun ever

Roomies: Jamie Laing and Francis Boulle are lucky to live with Ollie, who can impart his fashion tips
