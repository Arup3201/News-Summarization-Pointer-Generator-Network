A tornado hit a small town in central South Dakota Wednesday night, damaging homes and businesses and injuring at least one person, according to the National Weather Service and a hospital spokeswoman.

National Weather Service meteorologist Todd Heitkamp said law enforcement in Wessington Springs reported the tornado went right ‘through the heart of town.’ It hit just before 8 p.m.

Lindsey Meyers, spokeswoman for Avera Health, which operates the hospital in the town of around 1,000 people, said one patient in good condition is being treated as a result of the tornado.

'We've heard people are trapped in their homes here in town. Search and rescue are out trying to help law enforcement,' JoAnn Hettinger with Avera Weskota Memorial Hospital, told CNN.

According to Hettinger, the tornado struck right across the streat from the hospital.

'There is stuff and debris everywhere,' she said.

Meyers said the hospital only has some broken windows and is operating on backup power. She said the hospital is fully staffed with EMTs, physicians and some advanced practitioners.

Daugaard told KELO-TV he was also headed to Wessington Springs. He said the tornado went through town from southwest to northeast and homes and businesses were destroyed. KELO-TV reported a car dealership was among the businesses destroyed.

Jaime Hoefert, of Wessington Springs, told KELO-TV she saw the tornado move over hills and through the town.

‘We did see at least three homes destroyed with lots of structural damage around that area on the south side of town,’ Hoefert said.

Multiple calls to the Jerauld County Sheriff's Office rang busy, and calls to the county emergency management office went unanswered.

Confirmed tornadoes also touched down nearby, outside the towns of Woonsocket and Alpena, Heitkamp said.

Wessington Springs is about 125 miles northwest of Sioux Falls and has a population of about 1,000.

The town was hit by another serious tornado in June 2003.

The terrifying Dakota twister came just days after a twin tornadoes devasted a Nebraska town on Monday.

Around three-fourths of Pilger, Nebraska was wiped from the face of the earth when the two tornadoes blew through the town of 350.

Two people perished in that storm, including a 5-year-old child.
