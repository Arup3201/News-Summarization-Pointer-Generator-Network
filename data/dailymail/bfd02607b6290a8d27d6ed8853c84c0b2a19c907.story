Two people had to be rescued by police and armed officers after barricading themselves in their bedroom because they got scared of their dog – called Fluffy.

The dog owners blocked themselves in the upstairs bedroom of their home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, after becoming frightened of their Staffordshire bull terrier’s behaviour.

They rang 999 at about 6.30am after the dog started to attack and police, armed officers, fire crews and paramedics were sent to the house.

 man was injured, though not seriously. The dog has been seized as 
suspected under the Dangerous Dogs Act but it is yet to be assessed.'
