New Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon was joined by the First Lady on Thursday night, as she took part in a skit and promoted her Let's Move campaign.

Michelle Obama talked about the Olympics, her first job, and how her eldest daughter Malia will soon be learning to drive.

In the opening section to the show, the First Lady starred in a skit with Fallon and Anchorman star Will Ferrell, where she showed off her dance moves.

She later returned, wearing an elegant black outfit, to chat to Fallon in front of the live Tonight Show studio audience.

'This is so cool,' Mrs Obama said as she joined Fallon, and congratulated him on his first week as host of the show.

When Fallon asked if her daughters Malia and Sasha would have enjoyed the skit their mom was just in, Mrs Obama told him that she tries not to let her girls watch TV.

'They are 15 and 12. They want nothing to do with us,' she added. 'They want normalcy and the White House is not normal.'

She added that when she asks Malia if she wants to bring friends home, her daughter tells her 'No one wants to come to the White House'.

As Fallon joked that Malia would soon be learning to drive in the presidential limo, the First Lady laughed and said: 'Ladies and gentleman in DC, watch out ... I have security, but look out.'

The pair also discussed the Winter Games in Sochi, but when Fallon asked if Mrs Obama would like to try some of the sports, she said they all looked 'dangerous', adding: 'I just want to watch.'

As the subject moved to sports it wasn't long before Fallon was asking how the Let's Move campaign, now in its fourth year, was doing.

Mrs Obama described it as a success and announced plans to get people across the country to show the campaign how they were moving, by posting pictures on social media, using the hashtag #letsmove.

She added that if the campaign got enough of a response the President and Vice-President may post pictures of how they move too.

The First Lady also used her slot on the show to promote Obamacare, telling Fallon that young people 'were knuckleheads' who think they are invincible, and said they needed to get health insurance.

She reminded viewers that those under 26 can stay on their parents' healthcare, and said after 26 they could find coverage from as little as $50 a month.

As Fallon gave details of the healthcare website, which was plagued with problems when it first started, Mrs Obama interrupted to yell out 'It's working'.

To keep the mood light, Fallon asked Mrs Obama to reveal details about a series of firsts seeing as she was the First Lady.

In the segment, she said the first meal she cooked herself was mac n cheese. When Fallon asked if the President could cook, she said: 'Yes he can. He doesn't,' before adding that Obama had cooked 'five times for me'.

Mrs Obama also revealed her first job had been at a book bindery - a job 'that sent me to college' - and said her first school dance had been at a nearby Catholic all girls school, because she knew lots of boys would be there.

In the Ew skit, which opened the show, the First Lady showed her sense of humor as she joined Fallon and Ferrell who were dressed like teenage girls.

The three talked about the Winter Olympics in Russia, as Mrs Obama revealed she had been enjoying the figure skating.

But when Ferrell's character interrupted to say 'Exercise, ew!', the First Lady became sterner, as she pushed her Let's Move campaign.

'Exercise is not "ew",' she told the characters, adding that she enjoyed playing tennis and dancing - a revelation that led to an impromptu dance party where Mrs Obama showed off her moves.

Later in the skit, Ferrell's character held up flashcards to see if he could get the others to say 'ew'. But when pictures of junk food were shown, Mrs Obama made another push for healthy living,

'Potato chips? ew,' she said, before offering Fallon and Ferrell kale chips as a healthy alternative.

It's not the first time Mrs Obama has joined Fallon on TV. She appeared in two episodes of his shows before to challenge the host to sporting feats, including a sack race, in the White House, and for a skit on the 'history of mom dancing'.
