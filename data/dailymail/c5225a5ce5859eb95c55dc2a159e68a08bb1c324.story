The estate of the mother of Newtown 
school shooter Adam Lanza is worth roughly $64,000, according to a 
Connecticut attorney who inventoried her finances, which is a 
devastating blow for victims of the massacre who are seeking damages 
over the shooting that left 27 people dead and a small town in shock.

Nancy
 Lanza, the mother of the disturbed shooter who bought him multiple 
firearms and taught him to shoot when he was just a small child, had 
five bank accounts worth a total of $60,000, according to an inventory 
of her finances  filed in probate court earlier this month by attorney 
Samuel Starks.

Net worth: The estate of Nancy Lanza, mother of Newtown Elementary School shooter Adam Lanza, is worth about $60,000, not nearly enough to satisfy the families of victims that plan to sue her estate

Under water: Lanza's house is worth about $360,000, but the mortgage on the house is currently owed about $402,000

In cold blood: Lanza killed his mother while she slept in her bed on the morning of December 14, 2012. Above, a rifle lying on the floor of a bedroom in their Connecticut home

Rampage: After shooting his mother, Lanza drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School where he proceeded to kill 6 staff and 20 first-grade students

The home Nancy Lanza shared with her 
son - where Adam Lanza fatally shot her as she was laying in her bed - 
has a fair market value of about $360,000. However, Lanza owes more than
 $400,000 on the mortgage of the home, so her estate is 'underwater' for
 about $40,000 on the Yogananda Street property.

Other than the home and bank accounts, Nancy Lanza's only other assets is a jewelery collection valued at about $5,000.

The inventory of Nancy Lanza's finances was first reported by the Hartford Courant.

According
 to the paper, the 3,100-square-foot home - that has been vacant since 
the December 14, 2012, shooting - was appraised for more than $523,000.

However,
 real estate agents say it's unclear what the house could actually sell 
for once potential buyers realize it was the home of the man responsible
 for the second most-deadly mass-shooting in U.S. history.

A box of family photos was included in the stacks of evidence

Several attorneys representing the 
families of Lanza's victims have been waiting for Stark's report in 
order to decide whether to sue Nancy Lanza's estate. How little it is 
worth will likely be discouraging for those seeking financial 
retribution.

The home has 
been empty since the day of the shooting, when Lanza first shot his 
mother and then drove to Newtown Elementary School and murdered 26 
people - 20 of whom were first grade students - before turning the gun 
on himself.

According to the Courant, as of Thursday the front door of the house was still covered in plywood.

About
 two weeks after the shooting, authorities had finished collecting 
evidence they later used to come up with a profile of the shooter and 
had turned the house over to Peter Lanza - Adam's father and Nancy's 
ex-husband.

Probate Judge 
Joseph Egan appointed Starks to serve as the administrator of Nancy 
Lanza's estate after the two people named in her will declined to do it.

A photo released by the Connecticut State Police shows what the evidence report describes as a view of a second floor bathroom and its contents including a photo identification of Adam Lanza and a cellular phone with battery removed

Old newspaper clippings and a copy of Amish Grace, about a 2006 school shooting, was also found in the Lanza home

Books about Asperger syndrome, which Lanza had, were found in one of the bedrooms of the family home

Peter Lanza agreed to allow Starks to 
serve as the administrator, but requested that Adam's things be removed 
from the house. Lanza's brother, Ryan Lanza, also was granted permission
 to remove his property from the house after investigators turned it 
over to his father.
