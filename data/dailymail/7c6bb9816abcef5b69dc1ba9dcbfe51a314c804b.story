The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are moments away from becoming parents for the first time.

But as they plan for the huge life change a newborn brings to any family, no matter how wealthy or how blue the blood, one things is for sure: Kate and Wills will be doing this very differently from previous generations of Royals.

The two are said to be planning to break with the long standing tradition of a 
formal nanny (or many nannies) taking control of childcare in the Royal household.

Instead
they advertised for a housekeeper to help with multiple household 
chores and help watch the Royal baby, with Kate and William expecting to
do much of the hands on care taking themselves.

Traditional, highly trained Norland Nannies have served the Royal family for generations, but Kate and William are said to have advertised for a housekeeper in lieu of a traditional nanny

And, of course, Kate plans to spend the first six weeks of the baby's life at her parents' Buckinghamshire mansion, meaning she will have the 24-hour assistance of her very able mother.

Previously
nannies were a huge part of the lives of royal children, with Prince 
Charles, for instance, raised almost exclusively by a team of highly trained nannies.

Charles had two main nannies, Nurse 
Helen Lightbody and Mabel Anderson, who were surrogate mothers to him 
throughout his childhood.

At
the time - he was born in 1948 - a nanny was expected to do much of the hands on child 
rearing, with parents playing a far less hands-on role than we would 
expect today.

Children
of the upper classes were expected to be presented to their parents by 
the nanny, neat and clean and on their best behaviour. And the Royals were no exception.

Indeed, the Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, was not present at Charles' first three birthdays. And although that may sound harsh by today's standards, it would have 
been the norm at the time, especially given the pressure of her Royal 
duties.

Prince Charles
was supported by his nanny, Mabel Anderson, when his parents went on a 
six month tour when he was three years old. He later credited his nanny for 
providing critical emotional support in his early childhood years and 
beyond.

When it came to his own children, Charles and, of course, Diana, were much more involved on a daily basis wherever possible, 
although they still employed two nannies, Olga Powell and Barbara Barnes.

Olga Powell, from the prestigious Norland College, stayed 
with the family for over 15 years.

The formidable pair - of whom the 
children were incredibly fond - reportedly took the young William to 
parks in London in 'secret', in 'civilian' clothing and with just a 
single security guard, to give him as many normal childhood experiences 
as possible.

Olga
Powell cared for both William and Prince Harry when they were young boys, 
including the difficult period when their parents' marriage was breaking
up in the early 1990s.

William was devastated when Olga died in 2012, and cancelled numerous engagements to be able to attend her funeral.

As a child, the 
Queen’s nanny, Clara Knight (affectionately known as Allah) would have 
been staffed by a team of nursemaids, under-nurses and chambermaids, 
with the Royal nanny dedicating her time to being with the children and 
overseeing their strict daily routine.

Later
Marion Crawford joined the royal household as Governess, a role that 
incorporated private tutoring, some of the duties of a nanny and as a 
companion.

In a modern twist on the nanny role, Marion was in training to be a child psychologist when she accepted the post.

At just nine months old, Elizabeth’s 
parents went on a six month tour of Australia and New Zealand leaving her 
behind with her nanny.

During
this period the nanny would have been required to send regular updates 
of Elizabeth’s progress detailing significant events.

Via post one such letter accompanied by a
photograph of a smiling Elizabeth dated 8 March 1927 stated: 'If Mummy 
looks into my mouth with a little magnifying glass she will see my two 
teeth. Elizabeth; quite well and happy!''

Rosemary 
Albone, a Norland-educated nanny and adviser to nanny firm Care.com told 
MailOnline in a recent interview how much the role of baby care-giver has changed from Queen Elizabeth to Prince 
Charles, and how much it will go on to transition as William takes on a parenting role to his own son or daughter.

She
said: ‘With news that the royal couple have recently reported a job 
advert showing they are looking for a housekeeper, perhaps they are 
moving with the times and going for a modern approach to childcare.

'With
roles including walking the dog, polishing silverware, driving the car 
and watching the baby, the new all-encompassing housekeeper is a million
miles away from the type of care that previous royalty have received.’

Ms
Albone explains that the role of the Royal nanny has dramatically 
changed in parallel with the evolution of the Royal family themselves.

The Royals have modernised their opinions about the needs of their children and how 
they view themselves, their influence as parents, and the interaction they wish for.

Ms Albone explains that ‘broad shoulders and a tough skin were 
necessary attributes to cope with the amount of opinion shared about the
quality of the job [nannies] were doing by many members of the royal 
family and the public’.

Ms Albone says: ‘The role
of the Royal nanny would have been a tricky one to get right in terms 
of relationships; needing to acknowledge that the children may well see 
their nanny as a central and significant figure in their lives and 
someone who they could rely on to always be there; yet also someone who 
would never outshine the central and influential role of the parent.

Speaking about the arrival of 
William’s own son or daughter, Ms Albone said: ‘Much has been speculated
about the appointment of a Royal nanny and whether that role will be 
full or part-time, but what’s important is that whoever is charged to 
look after the little one will know the child and the parents’ 
preferences very well.

‘This blending of care is a skill that
the nanny will need to be an expert at; making sure that their practice
is guided by the Duke and Duchess’ ideas and wishes primarily.

‘As
with previous Royal nannies, the new Royal baby’s carer will be 
expected to have qualifications and experience and be knowledgeable 
about current issues and how these can be interpreted to benefit the 
child and family.’

BUT WILLS AND HARRY GOT 'SOFTER TOUCH'

The Norland nannies are easily recognisable from their distinctive brown uniform, which is strictly enforced

The tradition of nannies in the Royal household
goes back centuries.

Nannies appointed by the Royal household would have led a very restricted life, but 
helped shaped countless monarchs' personality, outlook and manners.

The
Royal family have tended to hire from the exclusive Norland Nanny 
College, where students are taught all aspects of childcare, including 
the manners and decorum required by a Royal.

Famed
for their strict old-fashioned brown uniform, Norland nannies are 
considered to be some of the best in the world, and some of the most 
expensive.

In terms of
the hierarchy of staff within royal households during the Queen’s 
childhood, nannies sat relatively near the top spot.

However
the position could be a lonely one, as the role fell between the rest 
of the household staff and they were considered neither ‘upstairs’ nor 
‘downstairs’.

An
obsession with rigid routines  - believed then to be essential for 
every child – means that most nannies were expected to put their lives 
on hold and dedicate themselves to a family that was not their own.

Although
the majority of royal nannies remained single, they were always 
addressed as ‘Mrs’ to acknowledge their position and to show respect.
