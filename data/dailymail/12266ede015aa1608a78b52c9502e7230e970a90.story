The Vatican has given the go-ahead for a Brazilian surfer to be considered for sainthood.

Guido Schaffer drowned in 2009 aged 34 in Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, weeks before he was due to be ordained a Catholic priest.

He was known for his work with the poor – in particular native Brazilian tribes.

The Holy See has issued a nihil obstat – or ‘no objection’ – declaration for the process of assessing Schaffer’s suitability for sainthood to begin, the Catholic News Agency reported.

Schaffer was nicknamed ‘the Surfing Angel’ and was much loved by his community.

Father Roberto Lopes, episcopal vicar for the causes of saints in the archdiocese of Rio said last May: ‘He was very sensitive toward others and was a man of great faith and was passionate for the word of God.

‘On the day of his burial, the Church of Our Lady of Copacabana was filled with bishops, priests and many believers who saw him a young man who was different and deeply loved God.’

He added that Schaffer ‘inspires more and more young people to follow the way of holiness while continuing to do everything that young people do’.

Last month a New Jersey nun credited with curing a boy's eye disease moved a step closer to sainthood Saturday in what church officials said was the first beatification Mass held in the United States.

A beatification Mass for Sister Miriam Teresa Demjanovich, who died in 1927, was led by Cardinal Angelo Amato at the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Newark. Beatification is the third in a four-step process toward sainthood.

Demjanovich is credited with curing a boy's macular degeneration in the 1960s, the Archdiocese of Newark says. The boy, Michael Mencer, was given a lock of the nun's hair and prayed to her. The effects of the eye disease soon began to fade, Roman Catholic Church officials say.

Beatification requires evidence of one miracle that happened after the candidate has died and as a result of a specific plea to the candidate. Sainthood requires a second miracle, though candidates deemed martyrs need only one for canonization.
