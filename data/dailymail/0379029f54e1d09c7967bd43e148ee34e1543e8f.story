A Japanese space explorer took off today on a  six-year journey to complete the most ambitious mission to an asteroid ever attempted.

The explorer, named Hayabusa 2, is heading for the carbon-rich asteroid 1999 JU3, which could hold secrets to how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago.

The probe is expected travel 185 million miles (300 million km) to reach the asteroid in mid-2018, spend 18 months studying it and return in late 2020 with samples in time for the Tokyo Summer Olympics.

A Japanese space explorer took off today on a six-year journey to complete the most ambitious mission to an asteroid ever attempted. The explorer, named Hayabusa 2, is heading for the carbon-rich asteroid 1999 JU3, which could hold secrets to how the solar system formed

The 1,300lbs (600 kg) spacecraft was launched on a hydrogen-fueled H-2A rocket at the seaside spaceport of Tanegashima in southern Japan.

The rocket's upper stage engine fired twice to help the daring spacecraft break free from the pull of Earth's gravity.

Carrying four stowaway landers, the spacecraft separated from the H-2A rocket at 06:09 GMT (1:09am EST).

Once it reaches the asteroid, a small device will separate from the explorer and shoot a projectile to blast open a crater several feet in diameter.

Japan's next asteroid sample return mission will take six years to return material from 1999 JU3 back to Earth. This will involve a number of stages, including dropping an 'impactor' that will explode above the asteroid's surface to allow a probe to collect material

The 31 billion yen (£166 million or $260 million) project is sending a probe towards the unpoetically-named 1999 JU3 asteroid in deep space.

It will blast a crater in the asteroid to collect virgin materials unexposed to millennia of solar wind and radiation.

It aims to answer some fundamental questions about life and the universe - including how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago.

Hayabusa 2, about the size of a refrigerator, is expected to reach the asteroid in 2018 and will spend around 18 months studying the surface.

It will also drop tiny Minerva-II rover robots as well as a French-German landing package named Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout (Mascot) for surface observation. 

In a galactic first, Hayabusa 2 will drop an 'impactor' that will explode above the asteroid's surface and fire a metal bullet into the crust at a speed of 4,5000 miles (7,200 l,) -- six times the speed of sound on Earth.

The bullet is expected to create a small crater that will enable the probe to collect material that will be returned to Earth in 2020.

The probe will map the surface of the asteroid before touching down, deploying small explosives to blast a crater to collect virgin materials unexposed to millennia of solar wind and radiation.

An impactor will explode above the asteroid's surface and fire a metal bullet into the crust at a speed of 4,5000 miles (7,200 l,) -- six times the speed of sound on Earth.

Hayabusa, which means peregrine falcon in Japanese, plans to hide behind the asteroid during the blast to protect its vital systems.

The probe is a rectangular unit with two sets of solar panels sticking out from its sides. The main unit measures 3.3 x 5.2 x 4.6 ft (1 x 1.6 x 1.4 metres).

'The asteroid is carbonaceous and we may find organic matter and water, the stuff of life,' said Hitoshi Kuninaka, project leader at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.

'The impactor is made fully with Japanese technologies that are so advanced you would think they are out of this world,' he added 

It will also drop tiny Minerva-II rover robots as well as a French-German landing package named Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout (Mascot) for surface observation. 

The mission should help Japan's space programme put a troubled past well behind it.

The first Hayabusa probe was unable to collect as much material as hoped but still made history by being the first vessel to bring back samples from an asteroid.

Its seven-year mission ended in 2010 when it blazed a trail over Australian before slamming into the desert.

But at the time, Jaxa's work guiding the craft back to Earth made it a source of pride for Japan, even inspiring several Japanese feature films.

By reaching inside an asteroid this time, the new explorer may recover material that is not as weathered by the space environment and heat.

'The mission was completed one way or another, but we stumbled along the way,' said Akitaka Kishi from Jaxa's lunar and planetary exploration team.

'To travel there and bring back something is extremely difficult.'

Asteroids are believed to have formed at the dawn of the solar system and the probe's target is one called 1999 JU3, which scientists believe contains organic matter that may have contributed to life on Earth.

Asteroid 1999 JU3, a rocky body around 3,000ft (900 metres) across with a tenuous gravity field, with a gravity field 60,000 times weaker than Earth's.

It is believed to contain significantly more organic matter and water than the potato-shaped rock studied by the original Hayabusa.

Its launch, postponed twice because of bad weather, comes less than a month after a European Space Agency probe landed on a comet in a pioneering mission.

The European Space Agency's Philae probe finished a 57-hour mission on the surface of a comet on 15 November.

But the solar-powered probe lost battery power due to landing in a spot shielded. The Rosetta mission team hope to revive it in March as it nears the sun.
