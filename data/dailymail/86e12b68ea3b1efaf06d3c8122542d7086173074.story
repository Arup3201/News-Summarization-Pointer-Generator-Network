President Barack Obama defended his decision to release five detainees from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl today, saying the country had an obligation to not leave its military personnel behind.

'Is there a possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us? Absolutely,' Obama said during today's press conference of the recently released detainees.'That's been true of all the prisoners that were released from Guantanamo. There's a certain recidivism rate that takes place.'

But the president added, 'I wouldn't be doing it if I thought that it was contrary to American national security.'

President Barack Obama defended his decision to release five detainees from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, saying today that the country had an obligation to not leave military personnel behind

Speaking at a press conference in Warsaw, Poland, Obama said his administration had consulted with Congress about the possibility of a trade 'for some time'

Days after his rescue, Bergdahl (pictured in a video released by the Taliban in 2010) was in stable condition at a U.S. military hospital in Germany

Obama brushed aside questions today about how Sgt. Bergdahl -  a suspected deserter - was captured in 2009.

The
 Pentagon concluded in 2010 that Bergdahl walked away from his unit, 
and, after an initial flurry of searching, the military curbed any 
high-risk rescue plans.

'Regardless
 of the circumstances, whatever those circumstances may turn out to be, 
we still get an American solider back if he's held in captivity,' Obama 
said. 'We don't condition that.'

Obama is visiting Warsaw, Brussels, Paris and Normandy this week where he is expected to elaborate on the U.S. commitment to counter Russian moves against Ukraine

Obama (pictured with Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski at a hanger at Warsaw Chopin Airport) defended how his administration handled the formal notifications, saying that when the opportunity to free Bergdahl presented itself, 'We seized that opportunity'

Questions have also mounted at home over the way Bergdahl's
 freedom was secured: Five high-level members of the Taliban were 
released from the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and sent to 
Qatar.

The 
five, who will have to stay in Qatar for a year before going back to 
Afghanistan, include former ministers in the Taliban government, 
commanders and one man who had direct ties to the late al-Qaida chief 
Osama bin Laden.

Republicans in Congress criticized the agreement and complained about not having been consulted about the terms of Bergdahl's release.

They say that by unilaterally negotiating the terms of Bergdahl's release, the President broke a federal law that 
requires him to notify members of Congress 30 days before releasing 
anyone from Guantanamo Bay.

Members of the House Armed Services 
Committee said the Pentagon notified the panel by phone on Saturday that
 the exchange was occurring in the next five hours.

Obama said Tuesday that lawmakers were aware that the U.S. could agree to a prisoner swap with the Taliban 'for quite some time,' and he defended how his administration 
handled the formal notifications, saying that when the opportunity to 
free Bergdahl presented itself, 'We seized that opportunity.'

That's not true, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said this morning after Obama's news conference.

'I don’t know what he means by consulted Congress for some time,' Rogers told MSNBC. 'In 2011, they did come up and 
present a plan that included a prisoner transfer that was, in a 
bipartisan way, pushed back. We hadn’t heard anything since on any 
details of any prisoner exchange.'

Officials said delaying Bergdahl's 
transfer in order to comply with the congressional notification rules 
would have interfered with two of the president's constitutional 
authorities: protecting the lives of Americans abroad and protecting 
U.S. soldiers.

'Because
 such interference would significantly alter the balance between 
Congress and the president, and could even raise constitutional 
concerns, we believe it is fair to conclude that Congress did not intend
 that the administration would be barred from taking the action it did 
in these circumstances,' National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a
 statement released shortly after Obama's news conference.

Obama
 has previously expressed concern about the congressional notification 
requirement, which was passed as part of the 2014 defense bill.

On Saturday Obama called Bergdahl's parents Jani and Bob shortly after he was secured to give them the good news. Together they officially announced the release of Bowe in the White House Rose Garden

Obama also brushed aside questions today about the circumstances surrounding Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's capture by insurgents in 2009, saying the U.S. has an obligation to not leave its military personnel behind

In a statement that accompanied his signing of that legislation, he said the executive branch must have flexibility 'to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers.'

The U.S. and the Taliban negotiated the prisoner exchange indirectly, with the government of Qatar serving as an intermediary.

The five Afghan prisoners are now in Qatar and are banned from travelling outside the country for a minimum of one year.

Republicans have also criticised the Obama administration actions as capitulating to terrorists.

Former
 secretary of state Hillary Clinton however gave a measured defence 
yesterday of the Obama's administration decision to swap the detainees 
for Sgt. Bergdahl, noting many of America's allies make similar deals.

Clinton
 said she did not second-guess people who make such tough decisions and added the American tradition of caring for its citizens and soldiers 
was a 'noble' one when she was asked about the exchange at an event in 
Denver.

'This
 young man, whatever the circumstances, was an American citizen - is an 
American citizen - was serving in our military,' Clinton said. 'The idea
 that you really care for your own citizens and particularly those in 
uniform, I think is a very noble one.'

Clinton said the most important thing will be to get as much information as possible from Bergdahl about his time in captivity, saying he could be a valuable intelligence asset and shed light on the Taliban's workings.

Days after his rescue, Bergdahl, 28, is reportedly in stable condition at a U.S. military hospital in Germany. It is unknown when he will return to the U.S., but when he does, he will most likely be sent to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antoni, Texas, a Department of Defense official told CNN.

'The recovery and reintegration of Bowe Bergdahl is a work in progress,' Bergdahl's father, Bob, said on Sunday at a press conference in Boise, Idaho.'It isn't over for us. In many ways. It's just beginning for Jani, [Bowe's mother] and I, and our family. There's a long process here.' he said
