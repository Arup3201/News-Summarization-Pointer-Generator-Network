Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has admitted his side were incredibly lucky to claim all three points against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. 

The Reds were gifted the win in the 95th-minute when Steven Caulker turned the ball into his own net to make it 3-2 to Liverpool. 

Caulker's defensive partner Richard Dunne also scored an own goal to open the scoring for Brendan Rodgers' side.

Liverpool skipper Gerrard vented his frustration during his side's clash against QPR

QPR defender Steven Caulker scored a late own goal to hand Liverpool the victory on Sunday afternoon

Gerrard, speaking to Sky Sports moments after the dramatic finish to Sunday's encounter at Loftus Road, said: 'I am still in shock to be honest. We were very lucky to come away with three points. Our performance needs to be a lot better. We never gave up and got rewarded at the end.

'We are going to go away really happy but going forward we have to improve. Football is a strange game, I am sure Harry Redknapp is in shock as well.

'We conceded two sloppy goals. We are coming up against the best team in Europe [Real Madrid] over the next few weeks so we need to improve.'

Gerrard's Liverpool team-mate Raheem Sterling, who has been making headlines this week for admitting he was tired while on international duty with England, added:  'We were not at our best but we hung in there and came away with three points. 

'It is always good to play football and I am just happy we got the three points.'

Liverpool boss Rodgers echoed Gerrard and Sterling's comments and lauded  Redknapp's side. 

'QPR didn't deserve to lose. We were very luck to get the win. We showed tremendous character but they certainly deserved something. 

'We didnt pass the ball in the first half, our movement was too slow. Joe Allen and Philippe Coutinho coming on gave us a lift.

'Sterling was outstanding in his running and his quick thinking for the first goal.

'The best players come alive when the game goes dead, whether it's a throw-in or in the game.

'Some players look for a rest or try to get organised, but the bright players come alive.

Brendan Rodgers was far from happy with his side's first-half display against the league's bottom side

'He spotted it, played it early, it was a great run from Glen Johnson to invite the quick ball, and obviously a great cross that the defender turned in.

'And the breakaways for the other two goals, they are just all about his speed, his technique, his courage to carry the ball, run with the ball.

'It was great courage and cleverness from him.'

Rodgers' opposite number Redknapp said he did not give a 'monkey's about speculation' surrounding his job while QPR striker Bobby Zamora blamed 'naivety' for his side's sixth Premier League defeat of the season.

'There was a lot of naivety. We should have got bodies behind the ball. It would have been good to go in at half-time with a lead but unfortunately the chances did not go in.

'There are plenty of positives but it feels like a massive kick in the teeth at the minute.'
