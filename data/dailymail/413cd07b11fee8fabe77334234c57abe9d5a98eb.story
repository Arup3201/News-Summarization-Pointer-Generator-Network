A drunk property developer who was 'cheered on' as he swam across the Thames died after he slipped under the water and drowned.

Bystanders who 'egged on' Laurence Newman watched as he got three quarters of the way across the river before he slowed down, 'panicked' and disappeared under the water for five minutes.

The 45-year-old, who was described as a 'strong swimmer' had been drinking all day in hot weather with his estranged wife on July 30 last year when he decided to swim from one side of the river to the other in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey.

Tragedy: Laurence Newman stripped off and jumped in the Thames near Kingston Bridge (pictured) but slipped under the surface three-quarters of the way across, a coroner heard today

He decided to make the journey from the Kingston side of the river to the Hampton Wick side.

Jumping in near the Gazebo pub by Kingston Bridge at around 7.50pm, he was cheered by members of the public on the busy riverside and made it three-quarters of the way across before he got into trouble, West London Coroners Court heard.

A huge rescue effort was launched but, despite attempts to resuscitate him, but Mr Newman, from Surbiton, died in hospital in the early hours of the following morning.

The court heard he had 269mg of alcohol per 100mls in his system - more than three times the drink drive limit.

Inspector Caroline Newman, of Kingston Police, told the court that a passer-by, Phillip Green, was walking along the footpath and saw a figure dressed in a black t-shirt and black shorts attempting to swim to the other side.

She said: 'He saw that the swimmer was making a steady passage across the river, but after a time things seemed to slow and when Mr Newman had reached about three-quarters across he appeared to drop forward into the water.

'He re-appeared shortly after and disappeared again. Mr Green realised he was in difficulty. He took off his clothing and swam across the river to help. He swam to the point when he last saw him disappear from view. He couldn’t see him as the water was murky.'

Boaters, including a student nurse, also jumped into the water to help and they managed to bring him to the river bank.

Coroner Alison Thompson said it was clear he had been submerged for more than five minutes.

The court heard a police officer spoke to his wife Gill who was distressed and appeared to be drunk, with slurred speech and red eyes.

She said they had been drinking most of the day and 'Laurence had decided to go into the river and before she realised what he was doing he had taken off his clothes and was in the water. He was egged on by watchers who urged him to get to the other side'.

Despite the weather, the water was cold, Inspector Newman said, adding: 'It is also the current and the depth and speed. As it approaches the bridge the flow and suction of the water is very strong.'

His mother, Pamela Newman, raised concerns about the amount of signs on the river bank warning people against jumping into the water.

She said: 'It is clear that it is a dangerous thing to jump into very cold water during very hot weather and people forget this. I think it is very important to show the dangerous nature of the water'.

She added that her son 'loved to swim'.

Inspector Newman said the police had a ‘River Watch’ scheme which worked to promote safety on the river bank, and that there were now silver railings near to the pub which were put in place after another 'life was lost'.

Recording a verdict of misadventure and a cause of death as immersion, Ms Thompson said: 'Whilst a strong swimmer, he succumbed to the combination of alcohol, the water temperature and the strong current.'

She also hailed Mr Green a 'hero' and said she would also be contacting River Watch to 'reinforce the situation'.
