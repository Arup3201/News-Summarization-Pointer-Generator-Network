A fourth new identity is to be created for one of James Bulger's killers when he is freed from prison once again - bringing the public bill for protecting the murderer to a reported £1million.

Jon Venables, 30 - who was released from his life sentence in 2001 - was locked up again three years ago after being caught with child porn images on his computer, but has now been granted parole in a decision that has left the murdered toddler's parents 'filled with terror'.

The killer was given a new identity when he was sent to a young offenders' institution at the age of 10 for murdering the two-year-old with Robert Thompson, then a second was created for him when he was controversially released from his life sentence in 2001.

Venables was given a third taxpayer-funded identity after he was sent back to jail in 2010 for possessing child abuse images, and officials are now understood to be working on a fourth new alias to protect his anonymity as it emerged the killer is to be freed once more.

Taxpayers will again pick up the bill for the latest identity switch, each of which are reported to cost around £250,000.

Officials were last night working on giving Jon Venables his fourth secret new identity.

Taxpayers will pick up the bill, likely to run into hundreds of thousands of pounds, for the move and for monitoring Venables around the clock.

Only a tight-knit cabal operating under conditions of extreme secrecy will know who he really is. One or two senior  probation officers will regularly visit Venables to ensure he is adhering to the conditions of his release.This will include a ban on travelling to Merseyside, and he also faces restrictions on accessing the internet after his 2010 conviction for possessing child  abuse images. Venables was given his first new identity when he was jailed in 1993, and a second when he was released from a sentence of indefinite imprisonment in 2001 aged 18. In May 2011, his name and background was changed once again after a ‘serious breach’ in the security of the identity he had been using.Earlier this year officials said they would not give him another identity because he could not be trusted to keep it secret. But they have been forced to change their minds amid mounting fears for his safety if he is outed.Earlier this year pictures purporting to be of Venables were circulated on the internet, despite an injunction granting him lifetime anonymity.

Only three other people are so notorious that they have been given new identities and made subject to lifelong anonymity orders.

They are Venables’ co-defendant Robert Thompson, Maxine Carr – the ex-girlfriend of Soham murderer Ian Huntley – and child killer Mary Bell.

This is aside from the cost of his stints behind bars, parole hearings, 
and keeping tabs on Venables when he was released the first time around.

The Ministry of Justice declined to comment today.

James Bulger's parents last night expressed outrage last night that one of his killers is to be freed again.

Denise Fergus and Ralph Bulger said they were ‘filled with terror’ by the decision to grant parole to Venables.

The
 child killer was sent back to jail three
 years ago after being caught with depraved images of children as young 
as two on his computer.

He admitted downloading and 
distributing the images, which included some of toddlers being raped, as
 well as posing online as a mother willing to sell her young daughter 
for sex.

In May, Mrs Fergus, 45, and Mr Bulger,
 46, appeared before the Parole Board via video link for the first time 
to beg the prison authorities to keep Venables behind bars.

Last night they spoke of their shock that their pleas had been ignored.

They said they had been given no information about the conditions of the killer’s parole.

Venables, who struggled to cope with 
living a double life the first time round, will receive another new 
identity at great expense to the taxpayer.

In a statement released through his 
solicitor, Robin Makin, Mr Bulger said the decision to release Venables 
was ‘misguided’ and filled him with ‘terror’.

Mr Makin said: ‘For Ralph and his 
family, the living nightmare continues and is exacerbated by the 
problems now created by the reckless decision to free Jon Venables 
without any publicly disclosed safeguards.

‘Jon Venables is a sex offender who 
has murdered once and made it clear when posing as a mother of a child 
that an “ultimate thrill” for him was sexual abuse of a child.

'The 
authorities have already experimented with Jon Venables living a lie and
 it did not work.

‘The decision to release Jon Venables is misguided and fills Ralph with terror.

‘Ralph fears that an innocent person may be mistaken for Jon Venables and be injured or even killed.’

Mrs Fergus said she too was ‘shocked’.

‘Venables has shown time and again 
that he cannot be trusted and that he is a danger to the public and 
himself,’ she said. ‘He lies and manipulates people for his own sick 
ends.

‘He is still a huge risk and . . . I 
doubt it will ever be safe to be let him out under another false 
identity. They should keep him locked up for a long time yet.

‘They should not take a huge gamble on letting him out.’

Mrs Fergus submitted evidence, 
gathered with the help of her solicitor, to the Parole Board that 
Venables was an ‘undiagnosed psychopath’ who should not be held in a 
mainstream prison but treated in a psychiatric hospital.

The mother of three said she received 
assurances that this evidence, and information gathered by the police at
 the time of James’s murder but never presented to the jury at the 
trial, which suggested her son had been sexually assaulted before he 
died, would be examined in detail before any decision to free him was 
granted.

Despite this, a spokesman for the 
Parole Board last night confirmed Venables was to be released. The date 
of his release has not been disclosed.

Neither Mrs Fergus nor Mr Bulger have 
been given details of the terms of Venables’ release, a situation Mr 
Makin described as ‘Kafka-esque’.

Despair: On her Twitter page, Mrs Fergus said: 'Just don't believe what I've got to go through. Again.'

Shocked: Shortly after the first tweet, Mrs Fergus posted on her Twitter page: 'Venables is getting released'

Mrs Fergus’s husband, Stuart, tweeted:
 ‘Our country justice system f****** stinks! Murder a child equals 8 
years (give or take). Have disgraceful child porn on ur pc equals 3 
years. British justice . . . you’re having a laugh!’

This year marks the 20th anniversary 
of James’s murder.

Venables and classmate Robert Thompson were ten when 
they abducted the two-year-old from a shopping centre in Bootle, 
Merseyside, in February 1993, and tortured and murdered him.

They were given life sentences for the crime, but released on licence in 2001 with new identities, to a huge public outcry.

The terms of Venables’s parole banned 
him from entering Merseyside, but it emerged that he had flouted the 
terms by attending soccer matches and nightclubs in Liverpool.

He was also arrested over a drunken 
brawl and for cocaine offences, but the then Justice Secretary Jack 
Straw allowed him to remain at large.

Following his arrest for child porn 
offences, it was revealed that Venables had fallen into a spiral of 
drink and drug addiction because he struggled with the psychological 
pressure of living with a new identity.

Solicitor Laurence Lee, who 
represented Venables during his murder trial, said: ‘My heart goes out 
to Denise Fergus.’ But he added: ‘As a lawyer it is clear that he cannot
 be kept in prison for ever. He may be released but he will never be at 
liberty.’

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 
‘The re-release of life-licensed offenders is directed by the 
independent Parole Board once they are satisfied they can be safely 
managed in the community.

‘Their life licence lasts for the rest
 of their lives, and they may be recalled to prison at any time for 
breaching their licence conditions.’
