Two women got into a fist-throwing, hair-pulling fight at a California nail salon when the store owner refused to give the customer's one-year-old daughter a manicure. 

Surveillance video from the Excellent Nail Spa in Lancaster shows the customer, Tawana Davis, taking a nail polish from the wall, checking the color and shaking it. 

Store owner Kathy Nguyen then asks Davis to leave and tries to grab the nail polish from her hand.  

Customer Tawana Davis and nail salon owner Kathy Nguyen got into a hair-pulling brawl after Nguyen refused to give Davis' one-year-old daughter a manicure at the Lancaster, California Excellent Nail Spa 

Davis pushes her back with one arm, while holding her daughter in the other. That's when the fight erupts. 

Both women begin shoving each other and Nguyen can be overheard saying she'll 'make the police come here' while Davis responds that she's 'staying'.

The surveillance video then shows that the child has been put down and both women are now hitting each other in the face.

Davis then grabs Nguyen's hair and seems to try and attempt to hold her head down onto a desk at the salon. 

Meanwhile Nguyen seemingly tries to grab something on the desk to hit Davis with as two of her employees rush in to try and break up the fight - to no avail.

Davis told CBS 2 she got angry when the salon wouldn't paint her baby's nails, and was arguing with Nguyen about her why request was ignored. 

Nguyen said she believed the child was too young for a manicure and that the salon had the right to refuse service. 

The store owner pressed a silent panic button to alert police during the confrontation. Davis was arrested on suspicion of robbery after Nguyen claimed she had stolen nail polish.  

Davis said she didn't steal anything and has plans to file a civil lawsuit.
