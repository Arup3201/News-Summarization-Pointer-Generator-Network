Michael Gove's education reforms have suffered a fresh blow after his flagship policy of giving universities a say over the content of A-levels was discontinued.

He wanted universities to take 'ownership' of the exams by dictating their syllabus and reviewing them annually. 

The reforms were designed to address concerns from academics that A-levels were not rigorous enough to prepare students for university.

The failure to commit to a continuing academic-led review might be viewed as the latest weakening of Mr Gove’s reforms since he was sacked as education secretary in July last year

It is understood the board, formed of academics at Russell Group universities, will soon be registered as a dormant company after a decision by Nick Gibb (pictured), minister of state for education

But the A-Level Content Advisory Board formed 18 months ago to oversee this process has been mothballed, it has emerged.

The decision by Education Minister Nick Gibb will be seen by some as the latest weakening of Mr Gove's reforms since he was sacked as Education Secretary last July. 

Since then, his replacement Nicky Morgan has been dubbed 'Ms U-turn' because of her differing views on key issues including grammar schools and pupil punishment.

The Department for Education said the advisory board could be recalled, but its suspension is likely to disappoint many academics keen for the sector to retain a role in ensuring the exam's rigour.

Although Mr Gove had suggested all A-levels would be scrutinised, only three subjects underwent major reviews. 

Some of the board's recommendations were shelved after proving unpopular with teachers.
