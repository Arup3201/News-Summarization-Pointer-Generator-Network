Controversial: Coronation Street's Bill Roache suggested in an interview that sexual abuse victims are being punished for their 'previous lives'

Bill Roache triggered fury yesterday after saying child sex abuse victims were being punished for past sins.

The Coronation Street star was forced to issue an apology for remarks which also claimed people should be ‘totally forgiving’ of paedophiles.

In an interview, the 80-year-old, who has played Ken Barlow for five decades, called for anonymity for those accused of child sex offences until they had been convicted of any charges.

He said celebrities can sometimes be caught in a trap by ‘sexually active groupies’ who, he appeared to suggest, are younger than they look.

Roache, whose soap colleague Michael La Vell is currently awaiting trial over hotly contested child sex allegations, made his comments in an interview with TV New Zealand’s One News.

Discussing the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal, Roache – a member of the spiritual Pure Love Movement – said: ‘If you accept that you are pure love, and if you know that you are pure love and therefore live that pure love, these things won’t happen to you.’

His interviewer commented: ‘To some people that sounds perhaps like you’re saying victims bring things on themselves – is that what you’re saying?’ Roache replied: ‘No, not quite, and yet yes I am, because everything that happens to us has been a result of what we have been in previous lives or whatever.’

He went on to call for anonymity for all those accused of child sex offences because of the stigma they faced even if innocent.

He said: ‘Paedophiles should be sought out, rooted out and dealt with.

‘But there’s a fringe of people who, particularly pop singers, they have these groupies, these girls, who come, they’re sexually active, sexually mature, they don’t ask for their birth certificate, they don’t know what age they may be.

Row: Reporter Garth Bray (right) asked the actor if he was saying 'victims bring things on themselves' and he replied 'No, not quite, but then yes I am'

‘But they’re certainly not grooming them and exploiting them, but they can be caught in this trap.

‘These people are instantly 
stigmatised, some will be innocent, some will not, but until such time 
as it’s proven there should be anonymity for both.’

He added: ‘If someone has done 
something wrong, the law will take its course. But even so, all of them,
whether they are proven guilty or not, we should not be judgmental 
about anybody, ever.

‘We shouldn’t go around condemning, unforgiving. We should all be totally forgiving about everything.’

His comments drew stinging criticism 
from the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, which 
called them an insult to abuse victims.

Outspoken: Coronation Street's Bill Roache is facing a storm of controversy today after claiming that sex abuse victims bring it on themselves during an astonishing TV interview

Dr Jon Bird, from Napac, condemned 
Roache’s ‘hippy-dippy’ spiritualist beliefs, saying child sex abuse left
people with horrific physical and mental scars.

The NSPCC described the actor’s 
comments as ‘bizarre’ and ‘not helpful’.

Jon Brown, head of the NSPCC’s 
sexual abuse programme, said: ‘We should be concentrating on helping the
thousands of children sexually abused every year who need therapy to 
re-build their lives.’

Roache, who has been in New Zealand 
promoting a Coronation Street stage show, later said he was ‘very sorry’
for any offence that has been caused as a result of his comments.

‘I would never say that victims of 
sexual offences are in any way responsible for the abuse they have 
suffered and I offer my deepest apologies if anything I have said has 
been misunderstood in this way,’ he added.

But in an interview with Sky News, 
Roache said: ‘Life is what you make it.

'We do come in to life to learn 
from certain experiences and broadly some of the major experiences we 
have asked to go through, this is my understanding of life.’

The actor is not the first celebrity to get into hot water over controversial remarks about the effects of alleged ‘past sins’.

In 1999, England football manager 
Glenn Hoddle lost his job after suggesting disabled people were being 
made to pay for previous misdemeanours.

Despite an illustrious career in television, Bill Roache has never been far from controversy.

He made memorable headlines when he claimed to have slept with 1,000 women during his youth, admitting he regularly cheated on his first wife Anna Cropper.

He also admitted to having a fling with Coronation Street co-star Pat Phoenix, who played Elsie Tanner, but later dismissed it as a ‘one off’.

The star has made many outlandish statements during interviews, many based on his spiritual beliefs with the Pure Love Movement.

On life philosophy he has said: ‘We are love, love solves everything, love is everything.’

Break up: The Coronation Street star split up with TV weathergirl Emma Jesson, his 44-year-old partner of three years, to focus on the soap and his spiritual side rather than sex and relationships

His comments on being ‘forgiving’ towards paedophiles chime with remarks he has made about Hitler. He said: ‘No one is naturally bad, everyone is inherently a very beautiful, spiritual being. Everybody, Hitler included.’

On Anders Breivik, he said: ‘If you want to get rid of that evil you don’t let him rot in prison. If we throw real love at him eventually he will realise what he did wasn’t right.’

At the end of the nineties Roache ended up bankrupt following a libel battle with The Sun for calling him  ‘boring Ken Barlow’. He won the case but was judged to have wasted court time with the law suit and was awarded only £50,000, the amount the paper had offered him to settle out of court.

He was left with huge legal bills which he compounded with the decision to sue his lawyers over the case, landing him in up to £600,000 of debt.

Around the same time he also launched a board game called Libel, which he invented himself and which proved a spectacular failure.

Earlier this year it was revealed he ended his two-year relationship with TV weathergirl Emma Jesson, 44, so he could explore a ‘mystic message of love’ linked to his membership of Pure Love.

In what he calls his ‘search for truth’ he has dabbled in druidism, donned white robes at Stonehenge, and experimented with Buddhism.

Last week he took part in a psychic reading in the hopes of communicating with his two pet dogs live on TV. Appearing on This Morning he said he believed all people are telepathic and telepathy will be the means of communication in the future.
