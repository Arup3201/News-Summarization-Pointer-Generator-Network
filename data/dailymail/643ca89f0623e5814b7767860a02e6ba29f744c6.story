Whenever those seasonal surveys come around about how much time women spend getting ready for Christmas parties (there was one recently, I think, that suggested it was something like 48 hours), everyone always misses the point. Getting ready is the fun part.

My pre-party prep always begins with a bath and a sneaky 'dressing drink'. The ideal addition is Chanel No 5 Bath Oil (not because I particularly like Chanel No 5, but because the idea of bathing in it makes me feel glamorous) and a gin and tonic (Hendrick’s and Fever-tree) with ice and a slice of lime.

Given that combination, I have been known not to bother going out at all. But assuming one must, it's good to plan ahead.

Be prepared: Pre-party prep includes planning for the morning after

So before you've even decided which shoes to wear, prepare for the morning-after. Put a large glass of water by the bed, a couple of paracetamol, two Alka-Seltzer and a packet of Soap & Glory's Off Your Face Wipes (£4.50, boots.com).

This little kit will come in extremely handy later on, when you roll back home smelling of illicit cigarettes (honeshtly, I never normally shmoke) and wine.

The Face Wipes are particularly excellent because apart from being alcohol-free (and by now you are wishing you were, too) they will get the worst off without requiring much in the way of hand-eye co-ordination.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. A party is one of the few occasions when it's worth bothering with a primer, especially if there are photographs involved and you don’t want to look like you’ve been imbibing port since breakfast.

Revlon PhotoReady Makeup (£11.99, boots.com) does a great job of controlling shine and glossing over open pores and fine lines, creating a matt, but moisturized canvas. I would do your foundation and concealer last, so you don’t have to worry about making a mistake.

If you have the time and money, and if your diary is chock-a-block with parties, I would also consider investing in eyelash extensions. Done now, these should last well into the new year, and they will completely eliminate the need for mascara.

Flutter (fluttereyes.co.uk) do an at-home service which spans the country and they can give you anything from the most subtle of sets to a full-on Strictly.

They are very low-maintenance and lightweight, but the difference is remarkable. I get mine done twice a year, once around now and once in the summer.

Christmas is the time of year when many women also decide to take the plunge and do a red lip. Again, if you know what you’re doing, great; if not, caution is advised. A bright red nail is just as festive, and a lot easier to carry off. But if you insist on red lipstick, be sure to use a liner. This is the difference between looking like a pro and a child who has gone mad with a crayon.

Mac's High Energy Pro Longwear Lip Pencil (£14.50, maccosmetics.co.uk) coupled with Lipstick Queen's Brat Pack from the Velvet Rope collection (£35, spacenk.com) is a killer combination.

Give yourself a few layers, blotting with a tissue in between (red lipstick on your glass isn't sexy, it's slutty), and top with a clear gloss for a super-glamorous finish. For an absolute fool-proof eyeliner, I would invest in one of Charlotte Tilbury's new Colour Chameleon pencils (£19, charlottetilbury.com).

And now for the morning-after. My favourite cure for hangover face (puffy, baggy etc) is to suck on an ice cube. Get rid of any excess make-up and bring your skin back to life with GlamGlow Youth Mud (from £8, glamglowmud.co.uk), a ten-minute treatment mask that will tighten, brighten and generally put some life back into your face.

Apply Cover FX Cream Concealer (£23, harveynichols.com). This water based, liquid cream concealer instantly erases under-eye circles, redness, dark spots and overindulgence damage, and makes you look like you’ve had 12 hours' sleep.

Finish with a swirl of your favourite blusher, a large cup of hot sweet tea and, wherever possible, a sausage sandwich.

It is the morning of my first training session with Mr Lean and Clean himself, super-celebrity trainer extraordinaire, James Duigan.

With the help of a warm spoon, I manage to encase my lower body in the pair of Bodyism leggings (size L) that he kindly sent me. I have on my special new sports bra - and baggy old top, which I vainly hope conceals the worst. It doesn't.

'You're not taking me to school like that,' says my daughter.

'Why, what's wrong?' I reply as casually as I can while struggling to breathe.

Whipping Sarah into shape: Personal trainer James Duigan

'Seriously? Have you seen yourself?' I take a look in the hall mirror. She's right.

We compromise: I will drop her, but do not get out of the car. Then it's straight to Duigan's gym at the Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge before anyone else sees me.

The atmosphere is a bit like one of those scary cocktail parties where everyone is either richer or thinner than you, or possibly both. Matters are not much helped by the fact that not only do all the clients look like supermodels, so do the trainers.

Thankfully, Duigan himself looks rough. Really rough. He's just got back from Australia via a private client in Turkey, and he has jet-lag and a weepy eye.

BEAUTY CRUSH...

Shu Uemura Natural Brush 18R Red, £42, liberty.com

Every girl needs a good blusher/powder brush, and this is it. Those bright red bristles are also fabulously festive.

BEAUTY FAIL...

The Sanctuary Spa in Covent Garden

The spa is closing its doors next year. I remember when this was THE place to be seen. A shame…  but part of the decline in day spas.

Physique like a demi-god, of course; but still, it's a crumb of hope.

Our session starts with a glass of swamp water (chlorophyll) and hip and leg raises, which don't tax me unduly. I do the plank, then he puts an elastic band around my ankles and makes me walk up and down like a crab.

All the while he chats away about this and that, a mixture of gossip, instructions and terrible jokes.

The jokes are bad, but they break the ice, and soon we are nattering away like old friends. The exercises go by in a flash: he's attentive, but lets me find my own pace. Duigan's whole technique seems to be the opposite to most trainers, who are vocal about pushing yourself, always trying to get you to do more rep, one last squat.

By contrast, Duigan seems non-judgemental, almost pathologically laid-back. His training style is fluid: if it isn't working, we move onto something else, always tweaking and changing.

I've never encountered this sort of gym-nudge theory before. Before I know it, we are done, and I am sitting on a mat feeling rather pleased with myself and drinking a nice smoothie.

I emerge awash with endorphins. I am so excited about the new me, I contemplate buying some proper gym kit in nearby Harrods.

Thankfully, I catch sight of a rotund woman wearing an ill-advised pair of shiny black leggings in the shop window, and think better of it. There's still a very, very long way to go.
