Ministers are being urged to take ‘urgent action’ after cancer patients in Scotland were given access to another drug not available in England and Wales.

Axitinib, aimed at kidney cancer patients who have stopped responding to other treatments, is to be given the green light north of the border after it was shown to significantly extend life.

The drug – which costs £3,000 a month – could potentially help 6,000 sufferers a year, but has so far been deemed not cost effective by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for use on the NHS in England and Wales. The body is currently considering an appeal against its decision.

Price of life: At a cost of £3,000 a month Axitimib is expensive but it has been shown to prolong life in cancer sufferers who have stopped responding to other treatments

Experts have expressed dismay at the latest example of ‘health apartheid’ between patients north and south of the border.

The decision of the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) to give the go-ahead for the drug in Scotland means taxpayers in England and Wales will have to contribute to the funding of the drug north of the border, but not benefit from it.

Critics of NICE say it is judging drugs using criteria from the last century and said the case for a fundamental overhaul was now overwhelming.

This year alone, the body has given only one positive recommendation for a new cancer medicine for NHS use, from the 12 ‘single technology’ appraisals on which it has made final or preliminary decisions.

At the Conservative Party’s annual conference last month, David Cameron was forced to announce a two year extension to the £200million a year Cancer Drugs Fund – an emergency fund which funds treatments denied by NICE. But there are growing calls for more sweeping reforms.

Professor Tom Powles, a consultant oncologist at Barts Health NHS Trust in London, said: ‘Whilst the SMC decision is good news for patients in Scotland, it’s important that all patients across the UK have routine access to innovative treatments. There is a clear need for kidney cancer treatments and it’s therefore very important that patients can have access to treatment options at all stages of the disease.’

Jonathan Emms, the UK Managing Director of Pfizer, which manufactures Axitinib, said: ‘Government needs to play its part in fixing age-old problems to ensure that innovative new medicines are used by the NHS and get to the patients that need them.

‘By continuing to focus on medicines as a cost not an investment, Government will not solve these issues. Instead it sends a clear message that innovation is not valued in the UK and it is not prepared to invest in life-saving and life-changing discoveries.

Outdated: Critics of NICE say it is judging drugs using criteria from the last century and said the case for a fundamental overhaul was now overwhelming

‘Decisions like today’s, where a vital cancer medicine is denied to patients in England and Wales by NICE, but at the same time approved for Scottish patients, further highlights the fundamental problems. We cannot allow this to become the norm.

‘The Prime Minister must take urgent action. A new pro-innovation mandate for NICE is needed to get patients the new medicines they need and prove that the UK is open for business.’

Ben Osborn, the firm’s oncology business unit head, added: ‘Whilst we welcome this decision for patients in Scotland, yet again we find ourselves in a situation where two health bodies, which have assessed similar information, reach an entirely different conclusion on the value of a medicine.’

Axitinib, which is marketed under the tradename Inlyta, is designed to treat adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of prior treatment with other drugs - sunitinib or a cytokine.

One trial suggested it extended life by two months on average, with some patients surviving significantly longer.

Patients in England will have to appeal to the Cancer Drugs Fund, though funding is not guaranteed. Patients in Wales have no access to any second line advanced treatment for kidney cancer and have to prove ‘exceptional circumstances’ in order to even be considered.

Public Health England has warned that more people are being diagnosed with and dying from kidney cancer in England today, compared to ten years ago. Around 30 per cent currently present with late stage disease.

Kidney cancer is the eighth most common cancer in the UK, with an estimated 3,850 people dying from the disease each year.

Andrew Dillon, chief executive of NICE, said: ‘Axitinib is currently being looked at for NICE by an independent appraisal committee. Earlier this year a draft decision to say no to Axitinib was appealed and the drug is being considered again.

‘Decisions on which drugs to approve are often finely balanced. Health services have to be confident that the extra benefit to patients justifies the price. If we are not sure, we have to say so, in the interests of all those of us who expect the NHS to apply its resources equitably across all of the demands we make of it.

‘NICE is, quite properly, scrutinised closely on its decisions and the methods we use to arrive at them.

'We regularly review our methods to ensure they are consistent with the ambitions set for the NHS and we are currently considering ways to make sure that we take full account of the impact of the severity of different diseases and conditions, together with the wider benefits to society of new treatments.

'We have always relied on feedback to draft the very best processes and guidance. We have asked patients’ groups, industry and our other stakeholders to help us develop this new value assessment approach. Drugs, especially those for cancer, which extend life for terminally ill people, have been given special weight by NICE since January 2009.’
