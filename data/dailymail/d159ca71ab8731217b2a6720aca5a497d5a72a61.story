Disgraced Luis Suarez received a hero’s welcome when he appeared on the balcony of his home after being kicked out of the World Cup.

The shamed striker was sent back to Uruguay after being hit with a nine-game international ban and four-month suspension from all football for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini last Tuesday.

But standing on the deck of his home in Lagomar, near Montevideo, the 27-year-old looked unperturbed by the ordeal.

Some might say he even looked happy to be home, giving a thumbs-up to admirers who had gathered.

Wearing a hooded grey top, smiling Suarez was accompanied by his children Benjamin and Delfina.

His return came as his team-mates trained in Rio ahead of their clash with Colombia and news that Liverpool are set to sell him to Barcelona for £80million.

Earlier in the day fans flocked to Carrasco International Airport to greet the arrival of the banned striker.

Uruguayan President Jose Mujica was even there at one point but left when he heard Suarez’s flight from Brazil had been delayed.

Because of the delay, the crowd of about 1,000 fans were moved from the airport terminal to an adjacent air force base to await his arrival.

Angry: Uruguay national coach Oscar Tabarez claims the forward has been made a worldwide scapegoat by FIFA

The Uruguayan Football Association are preparing an appeal against the severity of the sentence, which also includes a £64,000 fine and national coach Oscar Tabarez claimed the forward had been made a worldwide scapegoat by FIFA.

During an extraordinary press conference at the Maracana on Friday evening, Tabarez read a pre-prepared 13-minute statement to claim that pressure from the English media forced FIFA to ban him for four months.

The Uruguay coach then immediately quit his position on FIFA’s technical committee and told Suarez that he has the full support of his country’s people.

Tabarez said: ‘Many times you forget the scapegoat is a person who has rights and that in this specific case, besides the mistakes and faults he has committed, he has made significant contributions on the pitch. It is the contribution made by great football players is essential.

‘As a coach and a professor, and as a former teacher, I am presented with the theory of the scapegoat. You know what I am talking about, of giving a punishment, to someone who commits a transgression, not a crime.

‘We know the protagonists and not only because of the profile he has because of the mistakes, but there is another side to him. That is a message: the severity was excessive. 

‘Perhaps I do have the answers but like many people, those who not only have to make disciplinary decisions - who wins? Who loses? Who benefits? Who is harmed? Who got things their way? 

‘To one of these questions, I will not give you a final answer, but I will try to find a response. On the basis of these exaggerated decisions, only with decisions of this nature I doubt it. After the Suarez and Chiellini episode we have seen other things measured with a different measure.  

‘When that happens we have the omission because not all cases have to do with the transgression with indiscipline. Unavoidably this leads to exaggeration in terns if punishment.

‘We should punish and sanction, but one must always give the opportunity to hear from the person.’ 

Tabarez was highly critical of the FIFA’s disciplinary panel after they failed to give Suarez the chance to speak for himself after the incident with Chiellini.

FIFA’s strict regulations rule Luis from any involvement in football mean he cannot even watch Liverpool or Uruguay in action — he is banned from football stadiums and must train alone away from Liverpool’s Melwood training ground.

Suarez can be sold during his spell in football exile — a strong possibility — but cannot personally join in negotiations.

Barcelona have made it clear that Suarez’s ban does not impact on their intention to sign him and Liverpool have already started to get replacements.

Liverpool have also launched a bid to sign Lazar Markovic from Benfica. 

Following this third, high-profile biting incident, it is no surprise that Suarez’s major sponsor Adidas are thinking of ditching him. He has already been punished for racially abusing Patrice Evra and biting Branislav Ivanovic.

A statement said: ‘Adidas does not condone Luis Suarez’s recent behaviour and we will again be reminding him of the high standards we expect from our players. We have no plan to use Suarez for any additional marketing activities during the World Cup. We will discuss all aspects of our future partnership directly with Suarez and his team after the tournament.’

Another of Suarez’s backers, 888poker, are likely to drop him, with a spokesman saying: ‘888poker is seriously reviewing its relationship with the player as we will not tolerate unsporting behaviour.’

The independent FIFA disciplinary committee, chaired by Claudio Sulser of Switzerland, reached the decision to hand  Suarez a World Cup record ban after 10 hours of talks spread over Wednesday night and Thursday morning before it was announced at FIFA’s daily briefing at the Maracana.

The player and the Uruguay FA had been informed minutes beforehand. The suspension starts with immediate effect.

The committee took into account that it was not the first time Suarez had bitten an opponent. His first victim was PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal in 2010, for which he received a seven-match ban, and then Chelsea’s Ivanovic in 2013, which brought a 10-game ban.

Sulser said: ‘Such behaviour cannot be tolerated and in particular not at a World Cup when the eyes of millions are on the stars on the field. The disciplinary committee took into account all the factors of the case and the degree of Mr Suarez’s guilt in accordance with the relevant provisions of the code.’

The Uruguayan media claimed that Sulser’s committee had come under pressure from South American football chiefs, including the English-hating Argentinian football president Julio Grondona, not to punish Suarez too severely.

But FIFA insisted that there was no interference at all in the process. The world body’s president Sepp Blatter had been in Manaus watching Switzerland beat Honduras and  flew back to Rio while the Suarez hearing was going on.

Meanwhile, the Football Writers’ Association, who made Suarez their player of the year last season, decided not to strip the Liverpool star of his title.

Uruguay face Colombia in the last 16 on Saturday Central defender Jose Maria Gimenez said the team were ‘more united than ever’, while the country’s sports minister Liliam Kechichian commented: ‘We are hurt by this excessive sanction. Now let’s see how we can help this human being and whether the group can show its class and its love for La Celeste.’
