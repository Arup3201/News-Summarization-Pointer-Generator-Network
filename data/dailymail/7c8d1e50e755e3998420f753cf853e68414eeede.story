Rob Kearney has never forgotten being at home on his couch seven years ago, watching on helplessly as Ireland grimly clung on for dear life at the World Cup against Georgia.

Although capped away to Argentina in June 2007, Kearney, then 21, was excluded from Eddie O’Sullivan’s squad who bombed at the tournament that September.

Defeats to host nation France and Los Pumas confirmed their pool elimination after an embarrassingly-poor win over unfancied Georgia was only secured when the television match official ruled Denis Leamy had somehow managed to hold up prop David Khinchagashvili over the line and prevented him from scoring.

‘I’d the chance of being in the World Cup squad but I wasn’t really that close to it,’ recalled Kearney.

‘The whole thing was just a nightmare, that whole World Cup, and it just went from bad to worse.

‘When things started to go a little bit wrong, it was very evident from looking at them [the Ireland team] that they were all in a huge, high-stress situation.

‘You can learn from that a little bit. It comes back to having a huge amount of confidence in your own ability when things do go bad, never getting too carried away with how bad they can potentially get. ‘I’d like to think — and I genuinely do believe — that we are a very different team to the one that took the field in Bordeaux that day.

‘You’ve probably got a better squad, you’ve got more depth. And our mental capacity for the big day is probably a little bit better; we’ve had more better performances against some bigger teams over the last 12 months.

‘But it has been stressed to us already and it will be stressed to us a lot more throughout the week not to underestimate these [Georgian] guys.

‘We’ll look at a lot of footage of them over the last few months and their players, their key players in particular, and I’m sure we’ll see guys who are more than capable of playing a really good standard,’ he added.

Having emerged from a build-up to last Saturday’s Springbok game where Ireland were largely written off, despite having a strong spine available, the wildly-oscillating boom-or-bust psyche surrounding Irish rugby was again illustrated yesterday by Kearney, now suddenly fielding questions about just how good they are with an upcoming Six Nations title defence and the World Cup next year.

However, the 28-year-old is too wily to buy into the hype that has gone into overdrive in recent days. ‘I just stress that it’s just so important not to get too carried away,’ he cautioned.

‘What happens inside our team room and our meetings is very different to what goes on in newspapers and stuff.

‘Subsequently, at times when we’ve been written off, within that room we know we have huge capabilities and know we have it within us to win big games.

‘One of the strengths of the quality of players we have and the coaching staff is we all take a pretty realistic view of where we’re at that moment in time,’ he added, outlining what he considered a work-on that must be addressed despite the fashion of Ireland’s 29-15 dismissal of South Africa.

‘We didn’t get into their 22 a huge amount and didn’t build too many phases around that area that put us in a position to score some tries.’
