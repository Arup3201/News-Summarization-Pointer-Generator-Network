The mysterious UFO sightings in Europe around the 1950s have been explained by (yet another) mysterious Tweet from the Central Intelligence Agency.

The CIA gained 35,000 followers in the first half an hour they joined Twitter last month and now have more than 630,000 followers.

Now the spy agency have helped solved what was a strange series of sightings in Norway over 60 years ago.

At the time Norwegians documented what they believed were alien spacecrafts soaring across the sky.

Makes sense: There were a series of UFO sightings in Norway in the 1950s. But with one post on Twitter, the CIA have explained them, saying they were merely testings of U-2 reconnaissance planes, such as the one pictured

But thanks to one tweet, the CIA have explained exactly what was happening.

'Do you remember the reports of unusual activity in the sky in the 50's? That was us,' the Tweet said.

Attached to the tweet was a government writeup about the sightings, showing that they were actually test flights of U2 reconnaissance planes.

The planes flew above 60,000 feet, which wasn't thought possible at the time, so commercial pilots who saw something so far above them couldn't explain it.

The effect was more pronounced at different times of the day and night, and if the U2 planes caught the rays of the sun, people on the ground were able to see silvery glints of light.

The U-2 is a high altitude reconnaissance aircraft that reaches altitudes above 70,000 feet

The explanation was kept classified for decades to keep the spy programme a secret from the Soviets during the Cold War, according to the BBC.

It is yet another tweet that caused a social media from the CIA since they joined Twitter.

The agency joined the network in June with this script: 'We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet.'
