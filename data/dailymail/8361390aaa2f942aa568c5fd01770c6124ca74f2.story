A total of 31 alleged sexual abuse victims are suing over claims they were molested by Jimmy Savile, it emerged today.

The victims have launched legal action against the Radio 1 DJ's estate and the BBC, where he worked for decades before his death in 2011.

Solicitor Alan Collins, whose firm Pannone is representing a number of victims, said that a writ had been issued at the High Court on behalf of the 31 people.

Victims: 31 people have launched legal action against the estate of Jimmy Savile, pictured, over abuse claims

Star: The DJ presented Top of the Pops as well as Jim'll Fix It before he died in 2011

He added that the number of alleged victims getting in touch with him 'grows on a daily basis'.

He said: 'The purpose of issuing the writ is to protect our clients' position and to seek management directions from the court to ensure the claims are administered as efficiently as possible.

'At this stage we are unable to expand in detail on the nature of the cases or the allegations that have been made, which range in seriousness from inappropriate behaviour to serious sexual abuse.'

Lawyer: Alan Collins says his firm is hearing from more and more alleged victims every day

Target: The BBC, where Savile worked for decades, is also named in the legal action

Savile, who presented Top of the Pops and Jim'll Fix It, fell from grace a year after his death when an ITV investigation revealed that he had abused numerous young girls at the height of his fame.

A comprehensive report of the allegations against him published last month linked him to more than 200 sex crimes, including 34 counts of rape.

Claims that the BBC covered up the extent of his abuse to avoid embarrassment led to the resignation of a number of senior officials, including Director General George Entwistle.

A BBC spokesman said: 'We're unable to comment on any legal claims of this nature made against the corporation.'

Sued: The alleged victims have lodged a writ with the High Court

Savile's Â£4million estate has already been frozen by executors NatWest in anticipation of claims against him.

Another lawyer representing more than
50 of Savile's victims, Liz Dux, has previously confirmed that all of 
them will be pursuing civil claims for compensation.

She said that her clients would sue 
Savile's estate and would also pursue claims against the organisations 
responsible for where the alleged abuse took place.

Around two dozen of the DJ's offences
are believed to have occurred at the BBC's Television Centre - 
including during the filming of the last ever edition of Top of the Pops
in 2006.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
