They say the devil is in the detail. But for FBI agent Frederick W Humphries the problem, over the past few days, has been the lack of it - publicly at least.

Special Agent Fred Humphries has been revealed as the face, and torso, of the 'Shirtless FBI Agent' whose images were found in socialite Jill Kelley's email account.

FBI Special Agent Fred Humphries has been identified as the 'Shirtless FBI Agent' who helped begin the investigation that brought down David Petraeus

It was Humphries who initiated the 
investigation into harassing emails sent to Kelley that ultimately led 
to the resignation of General David Petraeus.

Amid the heat of that exposure the 
news of his own apparent indiscretion was treated as another layer of 
sexual intrigue in this tangled tale.

In fact, Humphries insists, it is 
nothing of the sort. The email was a joke that backfired more 
spectacularly than he could possibly have imagined and, perhaps, was 
allowed to.

The image in question was not some 
leering pose, directed at the object of his desire, but a round-robin 
joke - the sort of which the 47-year-old Special Agent was in the habit 
of sending - that ended with a picture punchline.

The snapshot showing Humphries - 
bald, muscular and shirtless - posed between two buff, bullet-ridden 
target dummies and carrying the punchline, 'Which one is Fred?' was 
framed and displayed on his wife's desk at work. His supervisor even 
pinned it on the notice board in the Bureau.

In fact as the Seattle Times reports,
one of the newspaper's staff was among those to receive the email, sent
in 2010 shortly after the Special Agent had been transferred from 
Guantanamo Bay to the Bureau's Tampa office.

The email was sent on 9 September 
2010. All of which points to the motivation of the sources that first 
leaked word of its existence being mischevious at best.

Because if not quite an Icarus figure
fallen to earth, Humphries reputation has certainly been allowed to 
wilt in the heat of the media glare.

According to the New York Times 
Humphries has a reputation as a 'hard-charging' field agent. It is a 
turn of phrase that implies an approach more likely to earn results than
friends.

Humphries reportedly received a 
dressing down from his superiors when he impatiently tried to push 
forward the investigation into the emails received by Kelley.

It has been alleged that, frustrated 
by what he perceived as a lack of progress, Humphries leaked details of 
the probe to the Republicans in Congress, contacting Representative Dave
Reichert in October and asking for his help.

Mr Reichert directed him to House 
majority leader, Eric Cantor who eventually passed the message onto the 
FBI director, Robert S Mueller, completing a circle that looped well and
truly above the heads of Humphries direct superiors.

One week later, on November 6th, 
Election Day, Mueller went to James Capper the director of national 
intelligence and Petraues's immediate superior - who urged him to resign
as head of the CIA.

In fact, the House Judiciary 
Committee has written to Mueller to ask why it took him a week to come 
foward with the information that Humphries gave him.

This is not the first time Humphries has found himself on the receiving end of his boss's opprobrium. 
'Fred is a passionate kind of guy,' said one former colleague. 'He's 
kind of an obsessive type. If he locked his teeth onto something, he'd 
be a bulldog.'

Humphries 'strong sense of right' led him to push forward the investigation that exposed the affair between Broadwell, pictured above at her brother's home in Washington, and Gen Petraeus

It didn't take long for that tenacity
to show. For some who have worked with him it is part of what makes 
Humphries 'one of the finest agents there is'. It is coupled with a 
strong sense of right - admirable traits but not always the most welcome
combination to those concerned with the subtleties of state and 
politics.

Humphries studied Criminology at the 
University of Tampa and joined the FBI in 1996. Within two years he was 
made the case agent in the Rassam Investigation which foiled Ahmed 
Ressam's 1999 plan to attack Los Angeles International Airport.

The trial judge in that case 
repeatedly praised Humphries for his integrity and efforts. But the 
agent still managed to fall foul of his bosses for his outspoken 
opposition to the decision to turn Ressam over to New York agents.

He 
felt that the tactic would unravel what trust had been established and 
lead to Ressam's co-operation drying up. He was proved right.

Having served in Guantanamo Bay 
Humphries might have felt himself on safer ground, transferred to the 
Tampa Office, but the opposite has proven true twice over.

Tampa society was far more dangerous territory than Humphries could have known. Natalie Khawam, Gen.

In May 2010 he was attacked by a knife-wielding man, outside MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa. 
Humphries, who was training with SWAT and special-forces soldiers at the base, shot and killed the man.

In an email to the Seattle Times he 
described the incident, 'I had four seconds that seemed like 40, to go 
through my mental checks.' Conscious of bystanders and cars, he waited, 
'till he was five feet from me before firing two rounds..after 
repeatedly warning him.

'I didn't have time to put on my ballistic vest. Crazy world.'

Crazy world indeed. The scandal that has spun from the investigaion first started by Humphries now involves General John Allen who has also found himself accused of 'inappropriate' email correspondence with Kelley.

Meanwhile two years after fending off
that knife-weilding assailant Humphries once again finds himself the 
target of an attack of sorts.

On moving to Tampa, Humphries and his wife 
became friends of Kelley and her husband, cancer specialist, 
Scott, socially. They dipped into the party circuit and mingling with the Who's Who in
Tampa and the State of Florida. Two years later Kelley did what Kelley 
seems to specialise in doing. She called in a favour.

She told Humphries about the emails she was receiving, and Humphries - hard-charging field agent that he is - responded.

He could never have imagined that in 
doing so he would uncover a scandal of such magnitude or that he would 
become a minor casualty of it all - stripped of his shirt and some 
portion of his credibility.
