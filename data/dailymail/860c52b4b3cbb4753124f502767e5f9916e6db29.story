China's ambassador to Britain has invoked Harry Potter villain Lord Voldemort in a diplomatic stand-off between Beijing and Tokyo over the Japanese prime minister's visit to a controversial war shrine.

Liu Xiaoming referred to the JK Rowling creation in a newspaper article accusing Japan of stoking tensions in the region and threatening world peace.

Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said: 'In the Harry Potter story, the dark wizard Voldemort dies because the seven horcruxes, which contain parts of his soul, have been destroyed.

'If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul.'

Liu's opinion piece comes amid the tensions between China and Japan over Shinzo Abe's visit to the shrine last week.

He became the first Japanese head of government since 2006 to pay respects at Yasukuni, which honours Japan's war dead including 14 indicted Class A war criminals.

Japanese cabinet minister Yoshitaka Shindo followed up with a visit of his own on Wednesday.

Abe said last week that the goal of his shrine visit was 'to pledge and determine that never again will people suffer in war', but the site is seen elsewhere as a reminder of Japan's 20th-century aggression against China and other Asian nations.

Mr Abe's visit to Yasukuni was the first by a serving prime minister since Junichiro Koizumi went there in 2006

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said Monday that Abe was 'not welcome' by the Chinese people, and it also provoked vehement condemnation from South Korea and rare criticism by Washington, which has a security alliance with Tokyo.

Beijing has been on a diplomatic offensive over the issue, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi making calls to his counterparts in the US, South Korea, Vietnam, Germany and Russia 'to convey his alarm', the state-run China Daily newspaper reported.

Liu's op-ed appears to fit into that effort and he reminded Britons that the victims of Japan's wartime horrors included their own countrymen, noting a new film that 'tells the tragic story of a British PoW tortured by the Japanese in the Second World War'.

'China and Britain were wartime allies,' Liu wrote. 'Our troops fought shoulder to shoulder against Japanese aggressors and made enormous sacrifices.'

'Our two countries have a common responsibility to work with the international community to oppose and condemn any words or actions aimed at invalidating the peaceful post-war consensus and challenging international order,' he added.

A Chinese man landed himself, literally, in the midst of a territorial dispute between Asia's two great powers after crash-landing a hot air balloon near contested islands held by Japan.

The Japanese coastguard said it had rescued the balloonist, identified as 35-year-old-chef Xu Shuaijun, yesterday in the sea near the tiny isles, called the Senkaku by Japan and Diaoyu by China.

The man's attempt to land his multi-coloured balloon on the rocky outcrops looks unlikely to have big repercussions for the two countries, however.

A coastguard spokesman said Japan handed him over to a Chinese patrol vessel on Wednesday evening and Japan's coastguard was operating as normal.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang described the man as a 'balloon enthusiast' and confirmed he had been handed over to a Chinese vessel upon being rescued and was in good health.

He declined further comment.

Xu's adventure comes amid high tension over the disputed territory between the world's second- and third-biggest economies.

Both sides have been repeatedly scrambling fighter jets against perceived threats, raising fear that a miscalculation could lead to conflict, which in turn could draw in Japan's treaty ally, the United States.

On the day Xu, identified as a native of Hebei province, was fished out of the water 22 km (14 miles) south of Uotsuri island, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reiterated his commitment to a stronger military and to revising the pacifist constitution.

'Japan will play an even more proactive role than ever before for world peace and stability,' Abe said in a New Year's message.

'We will fully defend the lives and assets of our nationals as well as our territory, territorial waters and territorial airspace in a resolute manner.'
