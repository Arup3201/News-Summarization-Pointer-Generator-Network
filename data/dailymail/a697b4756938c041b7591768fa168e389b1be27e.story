A sculpture that is part of the Elgin Marbles has been unveiled in Russia, after a secret deal with the British Museum, in a move that has infuriated Greece.

The headless statue of Greek river-god Ilissos went on display today at the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg as part of its 250th anniversary celebrations.

But the move has prompted a furious diplomatic row with Greece, as the British Museum allowed one of the classical marble sculptures leave the UK for the first time - in a shroud of secrecy.

The Prime Minister of Greece has once again accusing Britain of 'looting'. 

Antonis Samaras said the decision by the British Museum to lend the statue of Illissos to Russia  'provokes the Greek people,' and added that 'the Parthenon and its sculptures were the subject of looting.'

The statue's unexpected move from the British Museum came after a journey cloaked in secrecy for security and to ensure maximum impact.

The loan comes despite worsening relations between Russia and the West over its actions in Ukraine. 

The freezing political climate, which has been dubbed 'the new Cold War', may warm up a little with the loan of the Elgin Marble.

Last night, British Museum director Neil MacGregor told The Times: 'The more chilly the politics between governments the more important the relationship between museums.

'From its beginning 250 years ago, the point of the British Museum was gathering together objects in one place to tell narratives about the world.

'When the Parthenon Sculptures came to London it was the first time that they could be seen at eye-level.

'They stopped being architectural details in the Parthenon and became sculptures in their own right.

'They became part of a different story — of what the human body has meant in world culture. In Athens they would be part of an exclusively Athenian story.'

Sir Richard said the loan, which was only finally approved 15 days ago, adding that they wanted to 'leave room for flexibility if the political relationship between Europe and Russia changed.' 

The move is likely to reignite the Greek government's 40-year claim to the 2,500-year-old sculptures, which were removed from the Parthenon in Athens by Lord Elgin in the 19th century. 

In October, lawyer Amal Clooney – the wife of actor George Clooney – said Greece had 'just cause' for the return of the marbles.

Mrs Clooney, who is part of the legal team advising the Greek government on possible action in the international courts to force the return of the marbles, claimed Britain should be embarrassed for retaining them.

However, Mr MacGregor ruled out a return, arguing last month that they gave 'maximum public benefit' by staying in London.

The 7th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce, had the Parthenon Marble sculptures removed while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803.

In 1801, the Earl claimed to have obtained a permit from the Ottoman authorities to remove pieces from the Parthenon and his agents took half of the surviving sculptures and had them shipped to Britain.

In Greece, however, the Scottish aristocrat was accused of looting.

The marbles were bought by the British government to be displayed in the British Museum.

The Elgin Marbles are a collection of classical Greek marble sculptures, inscriptions and architectural members that were mostly created by Phidias and his assistants.

As the Acropolis was still an Ottoman military fort, Elgin required permission to enter the site. 

His agents subsequently removed half of the surviving sculptures, as well as architectural members and sculpture from the Propylaea and Erechtheum.

The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost of around £70,000.

The scupltures were shipped to Britain, but in Greece, the Scots aristocrat was accused of looting and vandalism.

They were bought by the British Government in 1816 and placed in the British Museum.

They still stand on view in the purpose-built Duveen Gallery.

 Greece has sought their return from the British Museum through the years, to no avail.

In February, while attending the Berlin Film Festival to promote The Monuments Men, George Clooney was asked by a Greek journalist whether Britain should allow Greece to reclaim its historic art.

He replied: 'You have a very good case. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad thing if they were returned. That is a good idea, a fair thing to do.'

Amal Alamuddin Clooney's law firm Doughty Street chambers yesterday confirmed that she had travelled to Athens, where she will remain until Thursday, at the invitation of the Greek government.

Her visit is 'in connection with the Parthenon sculptures that are presently on display in the British museum', it said.

The authenticity of Elgin's permit to remove the sculptures from the Parthenon has been widely disputed, especially as the original document has been lost. Many claim it was not legal.

However, others argue that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognizable.
