A western Michigan couple with 12 sons is eagerly awaiting the arrival of their thirteenth child - and even though they're sticking to their tradition of not finding out in advance whether they're having a boy or girl, they revealed that they will be 'shocked' if their streak is broken.

Jay and Kateri Schwandt are expecting their new baby on May 9,The Grand Rapids Press reported, and even though they expect it will be another boy, they say they will happily welcome either into the family.

'If we were to have a girl, I think we would go into shock,' Kateri said. 'It would probably be disbelief.'

'We would go into shock': Jay and Kateri Schwandt are waiting until the birth to find out whether they are having a boy or a girl but admitted that they aren't expecting their baby boy streak to be broken

While husband Jay said the couple are just 'hoping for a healthy baby', he admitted that he would love to see the effect of adding a girl into a household with 12 boys.

'I've experienced all the boy stuff,' he said. 'As long as we are having all these children, it would be really neat to experience the other side.'

The couple welcomed their twelfth son, Tucker, to the world on August 4, 2013. Their eldest son Ty is now 22. 

'The stuff that goes on in this house is all-boy - roughhousing and wrestling,' Jay added. 'If there was a little girl in there, I assume it would be different.' 

Perhaps surprisingly, Kateri, after being the sole female in the family for more than two decades, said she would lean toward having one more boy. 

'A little girl would be neat to have in the house, but a little boy kind of takes the pressure off,' she said. 'We know what we are doing. Why change things up?'

The Schwandts, who live Rockford, which is north of Grand Rapids, consider themselves devout Roman Catholics and don't believe in using birth control. Kateri comes from a family of 14 kids and confessed that she is thoroughly enjoying her pregnancy - just as she did the last 12 times.

'I love being pregnant,' she said. 'I've spent half of my life being pregnant. It's very neat and very special.' 

The couple say their growing family wasn't planned but rather a happy accident.

'When we had Ty, we were in college at the time, and we thought let's have one more so Ty's not ten when he had a brother or sister,' Jay told the Charlotte Observer shortly after baby Tucker's arrival last year. 'And then little Zach came along, and the flood gates were kind of open.'
