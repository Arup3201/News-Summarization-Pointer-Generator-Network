Levi Bruce, pictured, told his victims that in 'five seconds' they would be blind after squirting them with a noxious substance thought to be drain cleaner

A man told two teenage boys that they would be blind 'in five seconds' after squirting drain cleaner in their faces causing serious burns.

Levi Bruce from Swanley, Kent attacked the two boys aged 16 and 19 on January 21 at their home in Gravesend.

Bruce, 31, was involved in a feud with members of the boys' family.

Maidstone Crown Court heard that Bruce approached the 16 year old and said he wanted to fight his father. He then rang his older brother who appeared at the scene. 

As soon as the second brother showed up, Bruce squirted a corrosive liquid, thought to be drain cleaner at the two boys. 

Prosecutor Damian van Dagvenbode said: 'The defendant said he wanted to fight the victim's father. 

'After this, without warning Bruce pulled out some sort of container and discharged a liquid into his victim's face, from about two metres away. It happened very suddenly. 

'Before the victim knew it, there was a noxious substance squirted on to his face. Then the defendant said to him "in five seconds, you will be blind". He said it felt like someone had held up a blowtorch to his face.'  

Bruce was jailed for seven years at Maidstone Crown Court after pleading guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent. 

The court heard that the younger boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, suffered burns to his chin, chest, arms stomach and leg. 

His elder brother described the attack as the same as being burned by a blow torch.

Detective Constable Roger Harris of Kent Police said: 'To say this was a malicious and mean-spirited attack is an understatement.

'Drenching two men in a corrosive substance is an appallingly violent thing to do.

'Bruce claimed in interview that he just threw the contents of the bottle at them in self-defence and had no idea what sort of liquid it contained. I absolutely reject this idea.

'Both victims will be scarred for life from their injuries and have months of medical treatment ahead of them.

'I welcome the news Bruce will be behind bars for the part he played in this disgraceful incident.'
