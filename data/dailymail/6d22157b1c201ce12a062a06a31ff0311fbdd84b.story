Disgruntled workers have threatened to set fire to the factory they have been occupying since it closed down two months ago.

The group of 58 workers have been holed up in the now defunct Bosal-le-Rapide auto factory in Beine-Nauroy, northern France, since the business shut down in February and are demanding bosses pay them an extra €40,000 (£32,922) on top of the €8,000 (£6,584) they have been offered as a severance package.

They have told the factory's parent company, Bosal, that if they want the building to be handed back over intact, they must agree a better deal for the workers.

The workers have threatened to burn down the factory unless their demands are met by company bosses

Firefighters were called out today to deal with a series of blazes started by the workers outside the factory

The 58 workers have been occupying the Bosal-le-Rapide auto factory in Beine-Nauroy, northern France since February

They have warned Bosal, the company that owns the factory, that if they want their building to be handed back over to them, they must agree to a better deal for workers

To prove their seriousness, they have set fires outside the building, which firefighters had to deal with today.

When Bosal, the company which owns the factory, laid off 86 workers in 2012, due to falling market share, workers halted production for two weeks and twice kidnapped executives for several hours.

In this previous dispute, the laid off workers were also initially offered €8,000. The strike was called off after the company agreed to boost this to €25,000 (£20,576).

The workers are demanding an extra extra ¿40,000 (£32,922) on top of the ¿8,000 (£6,584) they have already been offered as a severance package

Workers at the factory staged a similar protest in 2012 when 86 of their colleagues were laid off during cut backs - they were successful in almost tripling the redundancy pay these workers received
