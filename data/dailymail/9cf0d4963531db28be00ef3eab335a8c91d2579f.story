The BBC once again faces questions over product placement of top clothing brands on news programmes after two presenters were seen wearing the same £550 jacket in the same bulletin.

Both Jeremy Bowen and Ian Pannell sported £550 waxed biker jackets from prestige manufacturer Belstaff on the 10 o'clock news on Tuesday.

It is not the first time questions have been raised over the broadcaster's journalists wearing expensive brands.

In 2011 the BBC was accused of 
allowing its presenters to advertise Berghaus clothing by ‘the back 
door’ – after negotiating a deal to buy Berghaus jackets at a 45 per 
cent discount.

The waxed biker jacket starts at £550 and goes up to £8,-000 for a python skin version

The Corporation was reported to have spent thousands kitting out staff on its most popular programmes in a range of the brand’s latest jackets and fleeces.

Presenters such as BBC news anchor George Alagiah, diplomatic correspondent Peter Hunt and scientist Professor Brian Cox were seen in the jackets bearing the brand’s red and blue logo alongside the name Berghaus.

And in 2008 viewers noticed a number of staff reporting from chillier climes were wearing jackets from outdoor brand North Face.

Its instantly-recognisable logo with the curved stripes has been seen on screen in a variety of locations across the U.S. and Europe, providing invaluable publicity for the manufacturer.

Wearers included economics editor 
Evan Davis and business presenter Declan Curry when they covered the 
Davos Summit in Switzerland.

it was also worn by David Grossman when he was 
reporting on the New Hampshire Primaries in the U.S. 

A Corporation spokesman said the two reporters wearing the same jacket was simply a 'coincidence'.

She
added: 'The BBC has no links with Belstaff and it would be wrong to 
suggest the BBC ever agrees to clothing discounts in exchange for on-air
promotion.'

Belstaff also made the famous 'Milford' coat for Bernard Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes in the hit BBC show Sherlock.

The coat had been discontinued, but after the success of Sherlock, Belstaff re-launched it in August 2010.
