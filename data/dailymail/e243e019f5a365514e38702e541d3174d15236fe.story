When England last ventured north to play in Glasgow, a bizarre diamond rush was unfolding in the Scottish Highlands; one which appears to have since fizzled out and come to nothing.

As they make the same journey, 15 years on, Roy Hodgson is polishing his formation and exploring options while hoping the sparkle he discovered in Switzerland proves to be more than a flash in the pan.

England’s midfield diamond caught the Swiss by surprise in September but has enjoyed limited success since and was abandoned by Hodgson at half-time during Saturday’s 3-1 win against Slovenia at Wembley.

England boss Roy Hodgson may decide that time is running out for his players to impress in new system

Has it served its purpose? After all, it was designed to get Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling into the team without dropping Wayne Rooney. But Sturridge was injured in training before that game in Basle and Sterling is not in the same irresistible form.

Success came at Wembley on Saturday when Hodgson changed to a 4-3-3 with Sterling on the right and Danny Welbeck wide on the left — where the Arsenal man performed with more energy and commitment than Hodgson might have expected from Sturridge in the same position, and scored twice.

It has been an awful couple of months for Sturridge and yet Hodgson’s switch to the diamond in Switzerland came with a feeling that this had been decreed as the best way to Euro 2016 and beyond.

It was the way to cram England’s best players on to the pitch, and into key areas, which logic dictates offers the best chance of success when stronger teams come into competitive range, at a tournament.

Without another sea-change, the next 18 months is about refinement: helping players understand the complexities of the system and how to react when it fails, as it did in the first half against Slovenia.

‘We’re moving in the right direction,’ said Hodgson. ‘I do think we can get a lot better, but we can’t do more at the moment than keep working at our game and trying to win the games in front of us. We won’t be patting ourselves too much on the back. We know there’s a long way to go before France 2016.

‘We know there are a lot of stern tests ahead of us and it starts in Scotland. I hope the players who get a chance to play will a) be able to stand up to any pressures and the crowd pressure and b) learn from it. Any lessons we take will only be valuable in the future.’

Glasgow will test England’s character while challenging their strategy. Can they develop this system against a confident and in-form team amid the frenzy of Celtic Park?

When Sir Alf Ramsey was greeted warmly by a Scottish football writer at Glasgow Airport before this fixture in 1968, he is said to have replied: ‘Welcome to Scotland? You must be f****** joking!’ The job, these days, demands a little more diplomacy.

‘I will change the team in Scotland,’ said Hodgson. ‘But we are not looking to play a totally different team because we know that is going to be a tough game. A game like this in Scotland will probably tell me a little bit more about this team.

‘We know what we’re in for and we know the way we play and we’re up for it. I am going to need some experienced players on the field. I can’t just make wholesale changes because we want to go up there and give a performance.’

The England boss wants to look at particular players in specific roles, including Stewart Downing within the diamond. Downing was among the substitutes at Wembley on Saturday but never likely to come on because he was troubled during the warm-up by a slight knee injury picked up in training last week.

Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster will feel at home if he wins his third England cap when they face the Scots at Celtic Park.

Hexham-born Forster, who is 26, lost just 17 of his 140 Scottish Premiership matches for Celtic after joining them from Newcastle in 2010, initially on loan.

Since transferring to the Saints in August for £10million, he has conceded only five Premier League goals, helping them become this season’s surprise package.

‘I do believe he’ll be available against Scotland,’ said Hodgson. ‘That’s good news because I’d like to see him in an England shirt at some stage during the game.’ Michael Carrick had been earmarked for the game in Glasgow until he pulled out injured. Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers are others who might be tested again, and Saido Berahino is in contention for a first cap, possibly from the bench.

Having sent Joe Hart home for a break, there will be a rare chance in goal for Ben Foster or Fraser Forster, who will be returning to Celtic Park for the first time since his £10million transfer to Southampton in August.

In four years as Celtic keeper, Forster broke the club record for successive clean sheets and the Scottish League record for time without conceding a goal, and won three SPL titles and two Scottish Cups. ‘I will be forever grateful for what Celtic did for me,’ said Forster. ‘They really believed in me. Stevie Woods, the goalkeeping coach, put in a lot of time and effort and really brought me on.

‘It will be good to go back. I know a few of the lads in their team. To play in a Scotland-England game would be a dream come true. It’s an unbelievable atmosphere. The Barcelona players said it was the best they’d ever played in. That tells you how unique it is.’
