Tragic: Spanish dress designer Manuel Mota has died at the age of 46

Manuel Mota, a Spanish dress designer specialising in bridal gowns for top models and high society, has died at the age of 46.

Mota had been the creative director of Spanish fashion company Pronovias for the past 23 years, helping to build the family business into a world brand for wedding dresses.

The fashion house said in a statement that Mota died at his home near Barcelona yesterday.

It did not give the cause of death.

Australian model Miranda Kerr and Israeli model Bar Rafaeli appeared on the catwalks in Mota's bridal creations.

Mota also designed the celebrated dress of Dutch supermodel Doutzen Kroes for her 2010 wedding.

Modesto
Lomba, president of Spain's Association of Fashion Designers, predicted
that Mota's ideas and dress patterns would one day be studied at design
schools.

'He's a reference for wedding fashion worldwide,' Lomba said in a statement.

'His work will endure in historical studies.'

Spanish
model Ariadne Artiles, who wore a dress from Mota's bridal collection 
at her own wedding, paid tribute to Mota, saying the designer was always incredibly patient with women's dress 
demands.

'I remember many fun times when I asked him for the impossible and he made it easy,' she said on Twitter.

'He was a delightful man, good-looking, fun to be with and one of the most sensitive men I've ever met.'

'The Pronovias family has lost one of its dearest members. We will keep the memories of so many collections, so many catwalks, so much effort, so much talent and so many dreams shared by all,' its statement said.
