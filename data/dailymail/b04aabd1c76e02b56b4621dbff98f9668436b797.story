A mother-of-two has died after being knocked off her bike during a charity cycle ride from Land's End to John O'Groats.

Sally Preece was a week into the nine-day challenge when she was struck by a car on the A85 near Loch Earn close to Crieff, Perthshire, on Friday.

The endurance athlete, from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire was then taken to hospital but died from her injuries the next day.

Mother-of-two Sally Preece, who was knocked off her bike during a charity cycle and later died 

Now her distraught family have paid tribute to the 49-year-old, who was raising money for the Alzheimer's Society, describing her 'dedicated and cheerful'.

Her sister-in-law Suzette Pennell said: 'Sally was absolutely dedicated to anything she turned her mind to. Her family, her work and her cycling.

'She had put in hours of training for the cycle ride and was raising money for the Alzheimer's Society.

'She had run several marathons before, and did really well in the London Marathon.

'She gave that up becayse of arthritis in her feet and started cycling instead.'

Mrs Pennell added: 'She was completely dedicated to her family and her two children.

'If there was anything going on in the family she was always at the heart of it, always organising something.

'She never had a bad word to say about anyone, and it’s impossible to say a bad word about her. She was just so nice and lively and cheerful.'

Mrs Preece was taking part in the 969-mile organised ride with colleagues from Lloyds Bank when she was involved in the accident on the A85 at around 11am on Friday.

She was taken to Forth Valley Royal hospital in Larbert, near Falkirk, where was was joined by family, but she died from her injuries on Saturday.

She had hoped to raise £4,000 for the Alzheimer’s Society, but since her death donations have flooded her charity page and today the total amount raised stood at more than £6,000.

The incident happened on the A85 near Loch Earn in Crieff on Friday, a week into the nine day challenge

Writing on her own page, Mrs Preece said she was taking part in the ride because she wanted to challenge herself.

She wrote: 'As I’ve got older I’ve got worse for accepting challenges!

'Perhaps call it my perpetual mid-life crisis.

'I suppose it started with black belt in karate, then running the London marathon, and finally because all of the above caused arthritis in my feet, I’ve switched properly to cycling.

'This epic ride is going to be harder than all previous madcap ideas!

'Cycling for 9 days averaging 106 miles per day, and then crashing out in a tent, is not everyone’s idea of a “holiday!" Being bonkers certainly helps.

'But this is nothing compared with dementia and what it can do to sufferers and their families/friends. It is a horrible scary thing and nobody is immune.' 

A spokesman for Lloyds Banking Group said: 'We are shocked and saddened by this devastating news and our thoughts are with the family and friends of Sally at this very difficult time.

'She was a delight and pleasure to work with and passionate about fundraising for charities. She will be missed by everyone that knew her.'
