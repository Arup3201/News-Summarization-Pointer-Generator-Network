English football's new golden boy Raheem Sterling has vowed to try and turn the other cheek if he becomes the target for Premier League's hatchet-men this season.

Sterling was the one England player who returned from their World Cup failure in Brazil with his stock greatly enhanced and the teenage star will carry the hopes of Liverpool fans still grieving the loss of Luis Suarez.

But with reputation comes responsibility. Sent-off for his country in England against Ecuador this summer for a bad tackle of his own, Sterling knows opponents are looking out for him now and wants to take inspiration from Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo who have learned to cope with being kicked regularly by over-zealous markers.

'The physical side is part of the game,' said Sterling, whose speed and balance can make a chump out of any defender.

'You are going to get defenders who want to let you know they are there, make you feel their presence.

'I've got to keep my temper, stay calm and try to play the game the way I think it should be played. If I can play well and score, they will know it's not all about being physical.

'I will definitely be keeping a cool temperament and doing my best for the team.'

For someone 5ft6ins tall and of slight build, Sterling can handle himself. He's already picked up eight bookings in his fledgling career and his red card against Ecuador in June – when he slid in recklessly against Antonio Valencia – was described as a 'lesson' for the youngster by international boss Roy Hodgson.

Sterling says his challenge is to let his talent do the talking whatever the provocation.

'If you are getting kicked a lot on the pitch, it must mean that you are a threat to the opposition because they want to stop you as early as possible,' he said.

'In this game, you've just got to look at people like Messi or Ronaldo, they get kicked all the time, I think they are doing something right.

'I'm not saying I'm a Messi or Ronaldo but it's the same that if you are in an attacking position, defenders will try to kick you. It is just part of the game, you just have to get on with it and try to do your best.'

There is a willingness to moderate his performances too and not try to win matches single-handedly every time he picks up the ball.

'I do like taking defenders on and making things happen, a goal or assist, but I need to try and mix my game up,' he acknowledges.

'It's not always about trying to take the man on, sometimes to try and play one or two touches, get in behind defenders and be a handful that way. It's a challenge for the new season.'

Liverpool beat a number of top clubs to win Jamaica-born Sterling's signature from QPR at 15.

He has won rave reviews as winger but recently has shown he can be a dynamic No10 too.

He was the catalyst for Liverpool's 5-1 win against Arsenal, one of their best performances from a season that saw them come close to winning the Premier League, and impressed centrally at the World Cup when Hodgson picked him there against Italy.

Diplomatically, he insists he is happy to play wherever manager Brendan Rodgers picks him.

But there's a twinkle in his eye when he discusses the central playmaker's role where you can dictate the flow of the game.

'The manager has trusted me a little to play the No10 role. I'd like to see myself inside more, becoming educated in that position,' he said.

'If I can get that bit more freedom, hopefully it would take my game to the next level and improve my goals-to-game ratio.'

The point about goals is important. Suarez scored 31 last season and others will have to step up if the club are to have another tilt at the title and do well in the Champions League.

Rodgers has signed five players this summer with more on the way but Sterling also wants to improve on the 10 goals he scored last season.

'Luis was a big part of last year, a massive part to be fair,' he admits. 'You've got Daniel (Sturridge) up front and the new player, but we all have to contribute to make up the missing goals.

'That is part of the next step for me, to improve my goal scoring. Not to put too much pressure on myself but that is definitely the challenge for me.'

Every few years, a young English player comes along with complete self-belief that separates it from arrogance.

Paul Gascoigne had it, Wayne Rooney had it, Sterling has it.

He doesn't turn 20 til December by which time he will probably have racked up 100 games for one of the most famous clubs in Europe. If Liverpool don't sit down with him about a new contract this season, the likes of Real Madrid would be interested.

Is he shocked by the speed of his progress? Apparently not.

'My aim was always to be in and around the first team as soon as possible,' he said. 'The club would give me a yearly schedule, Under 18s, reserves, first-team and I'm grateful a manager like Brendan came in and given me a chance.

'But I wouldn't say it is a real surprise because it's something I wanted, to play for a big club like this and show what I can do.'

By his own admission, Sterling was glad to leave London, his career might have taken a different path had he stayed. Even at Primary School, behavioural problems were bad enough for him to be asked to leave.

Turning the other cheek wasn't part of his life back then – but it's needed now.
