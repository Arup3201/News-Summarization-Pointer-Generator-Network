A chimpanzee at a New Mexico zoo has given birth to twins.

Keepers arriving at ABQ BioPark in Albuquerque on Tuesday found 38-year-old Elaine with two healthy babies. 

The zoo didn't specify the twins' gender but said that they are on display and 'doing well.'

New arrivals: Keepers at ABQ BioPark in Albuquerque, New Mexico, found 38-year-old Elaine with two healthy babies on Tuesday

Staff at the zoo knew Elaine was pregnant and suspected she was carrying more than one baby. 

She had gotten larger, and Alf, the 27-year-old chimp believed to be the father, previously sired twins and triplets. 

Female chimpanzees usually give birth to a single baby. 

Keepers say the mother has enjoyed nestling with her infants against the exhibit's glass walls, where it is extra warm.

Double trouble: 'Having two babies to care for is a lot for any mom, but Elaine is doing great,' zoo manager Lynn Tupa said

'Having two babies to care for is a lot for any mom, but Elaine is doing great. 

'It's fun to watch her walk through the exhibit carrying her newborns,' zoo manager Lynn Tupa said in a press release.

The zoo's last chimp baby, Kianga, was born in 2007.

At this point, the new four-day-old babies have not been named.
