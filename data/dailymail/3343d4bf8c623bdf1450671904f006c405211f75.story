Couples will be able to marry at any time of the day or night in England and Wales from tomorrow.

The round-the-clock ceremonies follow the lifting of a 176-year-old ban on getting hitched outside the hours of 8am-6pm

One of the first venues to embrace the Las Vegas-style weddings will be Blackpool Tower where couples can tie the knot at sunrise, midnight or even 3am.

Wedding venue: One of the numerous 24-hour chapels in Las Vegas which caters for couples who want to get hitched in a hurry

Local authorities and churches will not be forced to conduct marriages outside the traditional hours and at least 15 days advance notice will also still be required.

Venues for civil partnerships are also expected to conduct day and night weddings.

Laws
 which impose time limits on marriage solemnization date back to 1836 
and were introduced in order to prevent clandestine marriages, which 
were deemed to be a particular problem in society at the time.

The
 change was brought in by the Home Office following a cross-government 
survey, Your Freedom, which gave the public the chance to suggest which 
unnecessary laws should be repealed.

Kate Shane, general manager of Blackpool Tower is looking forward to ceremonies being held 380ft above the ground at the top of the tower.

She told the Sunday Times: 'We are really excited about this change as it now means we can offer sunrise, sunset and even midnight weddings.'

Registrar General for England & Wales, Sarah Rapson said she was 'pleased' at the relaxation of the wedding hours.

She added:'Marriage and civil partnerships are something very personal to every couple that chooses to undertake them and this change will allow people to make their day unique to them.'

Las Vegas has been the home of night-time weddings for decades and a favourite venue for celebrities to marry in haste and then regret their impulsive behaviour.

Singer Britney Spears married her childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander at 5am at the Little White wedding Chapel wearing jeans and a baseball cap.

The marriage was annulled after lasting just 55 hours.

Radio Two presenter Chris Evans married actress Billie Piper at the Little Church of the West in 2001. They were divorced in 2007. Bob Geldof and Paula Yates got hitched there in 1986 and divorced 10 years later.

But actor Michael Caine and his wife Shakira  who married in a Vegas chapel in 1973, will soon celebrate the 40th wedding anniversary.

Kelly Chandler, director of the UK Alliance of Wedding Planners, welcomed the change, describing it as a 'positive move.'

She told the Sunday Times: 'Wedding planning is so personal and individual and this change is just an extension of that, allowing people to make it that bit more unique to them.'

The way they were: Chris Evans and Billie Piper married in a Vegas chapel

Over the years, celebrities have flocked to Las Vegas to marry because they can get hitched there in almost total secrecy.

Marriage licenses are available seven days a week, including holidays and late at night, and there is no waiting period or blood test required.

Stars who wed there included Joan Crawford, Kirk Douglas, Clint Eastwood, Jane Fonda,  George Hamilton, Rita Hayworth, Elvis Presley,  Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow, and Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward.
