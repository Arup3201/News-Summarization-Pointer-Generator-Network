Paul Gascoigne was seen drinking from a bottle of gin just hours after he was released on bail following an arrest for an alleged assault on his ex-wife, it was claimed today.

The 46-year-old ex-England and Newcastle player went into a corner shop in North London, bought the alcohol and opened it at the counter as he was waiting for change.

The former football star, who left rehab earlier this year, was arrested over an alleged drunken assault on ex-wife Sheryl on Thursday.

He was held on bail overnight, but just four hours after his release, the former alcoholic was filmed on CCTV buying a bottle of gin, The Sunday Mirror reports.

The shopkeeper told the newspaper that the former ace had turned up in the Camden store around 2.40pm on Friday and had asked for the alcohol at the counter.

‘He grabbed the bottle as soon as I put it on the counter.

'He opened it and drank it neat while I got some change for his £10,’ the cashier said, adding that Gascoigne looked like ‘a mess’.

A shopper, who recognised the star and took a picture with him, said Gascoigne appeared to have been wearing the same clothes for days.

Gascoigne made his dishevelled appearance at the shop shortly after he was released on bail over an alleged assault at a Hertfordshire railway station on Thursday.

The Mirror reported that Gascoigne had grabbed a security guard by the throat before grabbing the arm of ex-wife Sheryl Gascoigne when she tried to step in.

According to the newspaper, he was bailed after being held in a police cell for 12 hours overnight.

A police spokesman told the newspaper there were two allegations of common assault, the first being against a station security guard.

The spokesman said a 46-year-old man is alleged to have grabbed the security guard around the neck, while the second allegation concerned a member of the public who arrived during the incident.

Friday morning, Bianca Gascoigne, Sheryl’s daughter from a previous marriage who was adopted by the footballer, was seen leaving her mother’s £800,000 converted farmhouse near Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire.

The news comes as it emerges Gascoigne’s bid to stay sober failed a month ago – and was caught on camera by a film crew.

Gascoigne was being filmed for a documentary about his sober life after rehab, when he had a relapse in front of the cameras, the Sun on Sunday reports.

The breakdown ‘is likely to be played out to the public,’ a source told the newspaper.

Earlier
this year, Gascoigne said he wanted to 'get back to reality' after the 
latest health scare in his battle with alcohol addiction.

He
told ITV1's Daybreak in March: 'I didn't ask to be an alcoholic, but I 
must admit I worked on it. I went to any lengths to get my drink, I'll 
go even further to stay sober.'

In May, Gascoigne was pictured looking healthier than he had in years as he celebrated his 46th birthday at the races with his family. 

He was pictured smiling alongside with ex-wife Sheryl, their son Regan and Bianca, at the Royal Windsor Racecourse.

Gascoigne went into rehab earlier this year, paid for by his friends, including Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans, Piers Morgan, and former England cricketer Ronnie Irani.

After he left the rehabilitation centre in Phoenix, Arizona, he told ITV's Daybreak how he begged doctors not to let him die.

He said he was rushed to hospital where medics did not think he was going to survive.

And in April he thanked the celebrities and footballers, including Wayne Rooney, Jack Wilshere and Steven Gerrard, who helped to pay towards his stint in rehab.

Hundreds of thousands of pounds were raised within just days to meet the £7,500-a-week clinic fees.
