SeaWorld reported a wider loss in its fourth quarter of $25.4 million as attendance to its theme parks continued to fall - due in part to the documentary 'Blackfish,' which criticizes the company's treatment of killer whales.

Its shares fell in premarket trading Thursday.

SeaWorld has been battling negative publicity after a 2013 documentary, 'Blackfish,' suggested that its treatment of animals may have led to the deaths of trainers.

The documentary 2013 Blackfish highlighted the treatment of killer whales in captivity at SeaWorld and instigated a drop in park attendance

The marine parks are known for shows featuring killer whales and other animals.

SeaWorld has taken out newspaper ads to defend its practices. 

And last year, the company said it would build larger environments for animals and fund additional research and programs to protect ocean health and whales in the wild.

SeaWorld's chief executive resigned following low visitor numbers in the wake of the 2013 documentary Blackfish, which criticized the firm's treatment of killer whales.

Jim Atchison, who had served as CEO and president since 2009, stepped down in January amid accusations that the company's treatment of killer whales may have led to the deaths of trainers. 

Attendance to the company’s 11 parks between October and December fell 2.2 percent to 4.4 million from 4.5 million in the same period a year ago. 

Attendance fell 4.3 percent during the entire year to 22.4 million from 23.4 million in 2013.

Jim Atchison, former president and CEO SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, stepped down from his position following the release of the controversial film Blackfish 

The Orlando, Florida-based company also said on Thursday that it expects to select a new CEO within the next six to nine months. 

Chairman David D’Alessandro took over as interim CEO in January after Jim Atchison stepped down.

During the fourth quarter, the company reported a loss of $25.4 million, or 29 cents per share. That compares with a loss of $13 million, or 14 cents per share, in the same period a year before.

Adjusted to remove one-time items, it had a loss of 21 cents per share, a larger loss than the 15 cent cents per share analysts expected, according to FactSet.

Revenue fell 2.8 percent to $264.5 million, beating the $253.2 million that analysts expected.

For 2014, the company reported net income of $49.9 million, or 57 cents per share, compared with $51.9 million, or 59 cents per share, in 2013. 

Adjusted earnings were 68 cents per share, below the 73 cents per share analysts expected.

Revenue fell 5.6 percent to $1.38 billion in 2014, above the $1.37 billion analysts expected.

Shares of SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. fell more than 7 percent in premarket trading Thursday. They are down about 41 percent in the last 12 months.

SeaWorld lost more than finances this month.

A beluga whale who was on loan to under-fire SeaWorld has died after fracturing his jaw during an 'interaction' with two other whales and later contracting an infection.

Nanuq, who was around 31 or 32 years old, entertained millions of visitors at the firm's Orlando, Florida, theme park while on a long-term breeding loan from Canada's Vancouver Aquarium.

No more attendees: Less and less are going to see whales perform at Sea World following the documentary 

But during a recent encounter with two of the three beluga whales he lived with, the 2200lbs marine creature suffered a fractured jaw. He later developed an infection and passed away on Thursday.

Although Nanuq had been undergoing treatment for the infection at the time of his death, a post-mortem examination has been arranged to confirm the cause. The results are expected in weeks. 

Scott Smith, a University of South Carolina assistant hospitality professor, said Nanuq's death could be potentially damaging to SeaWorld following the release of Blackfish.

'It really is one of the worst times this kind of news could come out,' he said. 'Any other time, it probably wouldn’t even make a blip on the radar, but now everyone is watching SeaWorld.'

Longtime SeaWorld critic and Animal Welfare Institute marine mammal scientist Naomi Rose added that in the wild, suffering a broken jaw from an 'interaction' with another animal seems unlikely.

Speaking to the Orlando Sentinel, Ms Rose said: 'If he died because of something related to that infection he got related to the broken jaw, then he died of being in captivity.' 

Blackfish, which implied that the stress of life in captivity may have been responsible of an orca's killing of Orlando trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010, sparked widespread criticism of SeaWorld,

Since its release, attendance has declined at the company's parks in Orlando, San Diego, California and San Antonio, Texas. SeaWorld's stock value has also plummeted.

To counter the backlash, the firm, which has participated in animal rescue programs for more than 50 years, has announced plans to nearly double the size of its orca enclosures in upcoming years.

SeaWorld has not yet named a replacement for Mr Atchison.
