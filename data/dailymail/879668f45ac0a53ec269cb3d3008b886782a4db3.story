Diane von Furstenberg showed off a custom-made designer arm sling last night, a week after breaking her shoulder in three places during a ski accident.

The fashion designer, 66, attended the 2013 Vital Voices Global Leadership Awards at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, with her left arm tucked in a black-and-white support bearing her signature chain print.

On her way to the event she tweeted a photograph of herself wearing a plain blue sling, but on arrival she swapped it for one that co-ordinated with her monochrome evening attire.

She told her followers: 'On
my way to DC. Arm in a sling, broken shoulder. But isn't it what Vital 
Voices is about? Strength? Women inspire me! Love Diane.'

At the awards ceremony, which honored women leaders from around the world, she stepped up on stage to give a speech introducing the former U.S. secretary of state Hilary Clinton.

Both women gave each other a big hug in front of the audience, although Ms von Furstenberg looked slightly 
pained at one point, as Mrs Clinton enthusiastically grabbed her injured 
shoulder.

For the past week she has been recuperating at her home in Los Angeles.

Explaining how the injury occurred she told WWD that she suffered a 'bad fall at the end of a day' while on a ski vacation in Aspen, Colorado.

She said that the injury does not require surgery and she took time out to 'rest and mend'. Reflecting on the accident she tweeted: 'Oh well..could have been worse.'

And she humorously added: 'Sometimes the universe gives you 
signs..."stay still" is the message I got from my ski fall and broken 
shoulder.'

The Belgian-born fashion mogul announced on March 25 via Twitter that she had landed 'on the mountain'.

Dressed for the occasion: Earlier in the day Ms von Furstenberg posted a photo of herself wearing a plain blue sling, but later she swapped it for one that co-ordinated with her monochrome evening attire

She accompanied the tweet with a photograph of the picturesque ski resort, framed by clear blue sky.

However the following day it appears her trip was cut short, as a follow-up tweet read: 'Ski accident. triple fractured shoulder.'

It is not the first time Ms von Furstenberg has suffered a fall on the slopes.

In January 2011 she broke her nose and fractured her cheekbone, after colliding with another skiier while holidaying in Snowmass, Colorado, with her husband Barry Diller.

Reconstructive surgery was required to repair the damage and Ms von Furstenberg later revealed that the operation put her off plastic surgery for life.

She
told the New York Daily News: 'If I ever had any desire to have plastic 
surgery, after this week, I know for sure, I would not want it,' she 
said.

'I was so terrified that I would lose my old face.

'If I did have plastic surgery, it is not something I would hide, because I don't usually hide anything.'

Doctors treating her at UCLA, where she was flown shortly afterwards initially thought she would need complete facial reconstruction, but thankfully the extreme procedure was not necessary after all.

The surgery sparked rumors that she had gone under the knife for cosmetic reasons after she appeared with bruising on her face.
