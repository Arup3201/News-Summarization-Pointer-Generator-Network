Google is working on a super-fast 'quantum' computer chip as part its vision to one day have machines think like humans.

The California-based group has teamed up with leading physicist John Martinis to build processors based on quantum theories.

The new hire is part of a 'hardware initiative' to design and build chips operating on sub-atomic levels in ways that makes them much faster than existing processors.

Standard computers deal with binary data expressed in zeroes and ones. However, quantum computing uses the behaviour of sub-atomic particles to encode data.

Experts believe that a quantum bit, which can have two states at the same time, may be able hugely improve the speed and power of computing.

Professor Martinis currently works at University of California, Santa Barbara, and is one of the most prolific researchers in the area of artificial intelligence.

His work with the company will be undertaken at the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, a collaboration between Google, Nasa and the Universities Space Research Association (USRA).

'With an integrated hardware group, the Quantum AI team will now be able to implement and test new designs for quantum optimisation and inference processors,' Google's director of engineering, Hartmut Neven, said on its research blog. 

Google, which is working on projects including self-driving cars and robots, has become increasingly focused on artificial intelligence in recent years.

In January, the company acquired privately held artificial intelligence company DeepMind Technologies.

Neuroscientist Demis Hassabis, 37, co-founded DeepMind Technologies just two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans.

His company has yet to produce anything commercially but Google still paid £242 million ($399 million) for its expertise in the pioneering field of artificial intelligence.

The website states DeepMind uses ‘the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning algorithms.’

Another of its founders, Shane Leg, warned artificial intelligence is 'number one risk for this century,' and believes it could play a part in human extinction.

'Eventually, I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will likely play a part in this,' DeepMind’s Shane Legg said in a recent interview.

Google has now set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence.

Elon Musk is one of the driving forces behind super-intelligent computers that could improve everything from space travel to electric cars.

But the Tesla-founder claims the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons.

Last month, the billionaire tweeted a recommendation for a book that looks at a robot uprising, claiming ‘We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes.’

Musk referred to the book ‘Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies’, a work by Nick Bostrom that asks major questions about how humanity will cope with super-intelligent computers.

Mr Bostrom has also argued that the world is fake and we are living in a computer simulation.

In a later tweet, Musk wrote: ‘Hope we're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable.’

Musk's tweets follows a similar comment in June in which the Tesla-founder said believes that a horrific ‘Terminator-like’ scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence.

The 42-year-old is so worried, he is investing in AI companies, not to make money, but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand.
