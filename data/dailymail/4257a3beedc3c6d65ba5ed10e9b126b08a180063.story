Carved into the side of mountains, these footpaths offer mesmerising views of a spectacular landscape.

Some of the footpaths on Jianmenguan Mountain in Jiange County, southwest China's Sichuan Province, date from nearly 1,000 years ago from China's Three Kingdoms Period. 

Over the years, these footpaths have been extended and a more modern addition is a protruding skywalk. 

Tourists can enjoy spectacular views from the Jianmenguan mountain in Jiange County, southwest China's Sichuan Province

A maze of different footpaths traverse the mountain, winding in and out of the cliff faces and offering amazing views of the surroundings

Some of the routes are more 'safe' than others, with ledges to hold on to and steps for comfort, others, as right, are more perilous

The routes are favoured with tourists, and offer the perfect opportunity to snap some photographs of nature at it's most beautiful.

And the location is steeped in history.

There are 72 peaks in the mountain range, and only one through road. The Battle of Jianmen Pass was fought between the communists and the nationalists during the Chinese Civil War in the post World War II era and resulted in communist victory in 1949.

Whoever controlled this 1.5mile long stretch of the road controlled the gateway of Sichuan, and the nationalists had built an elaborate system of bunkers in the area to strengthen its defense against the expected communist invasion. 

The communists managed to capture over 300 prisoners-of-wars and had all the remaining people killed in the fierce battle, and more importantly, the taking of Jianmen Pass secured the passage for the communists to invade deeper into the heart of Sichuan.

Much history is contained within the mountain, where steps can be traced from the great battle between the communists and nationalists

Wooden railings give some comfort to visitors to the range, but they will still have to be wary of hitting their heads
