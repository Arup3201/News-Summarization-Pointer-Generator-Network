Sports fans who marvelled at the thunderous thighs of German cyclist Robert Forstemann have found a new superhuman at the Olympic Park.... the swimmer with 'waterwings'.

Italian Fabio Scozzoli's impressive torso drew gasps from the crowd when he strode into the Aquatics Centre ahead of the men's 100m breaststroke final on Sunday night.

And when the 23-year-old dived in the water, his fully flexed underarm muscles looked like a pair of wings.

Scozzoli's 'wings' are so big, some swimming fans have accused him of growing fins to gain an advantage.

They
 may look impressive, but bulging arms didn't help him the world championships silver medal winner claim a place on the podium on Sunday - he finished seventh out 
of eight in the breaststroke final.

Forstemann's thighs exploded into the public consciousness after he was pitted against his compatriot Andre Greipel in a 'quad off' by New Zealand cyclist Greg Henderson.

The track and road racing cyclist 
posted a photograph on Twitter of the pair standing next to each other 
bearing their muscular bottom halves.

Mr
 Henderson said: ‘You thought Greipel has a big set of legs. There was a
 quad off in the German camp today. Greipel lost.

The
 post was accompanied with the above picture which seemed to prove the 
two cyclists had been sticking to their strict Games training regime - 
no doubt with plenty of squats.

Although Greipel’s thighs look big, 
Förstemann has freakishly large vein-laden muscles which dwarf those of 
his 30-year-old compatriot.

Forstemann
 was part of the UCI Track Cycling world champion side which won the 
team sprint for the Germans, but has been omitted from the sprint team 
for the London Games.

Greipel - as well as partaking in 
Henderson's 'quad off' - competed alongside Mark Cavendish and Bradley 
Wiggins in Saturday's equally thrilling road race.
