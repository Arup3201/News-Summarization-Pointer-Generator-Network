Charges were filed Thursday in an investigation into an alleged swingers party last May that turned into a violent ruckus after an argument between the spouses of two Denver Police officers escalated into a full-blown altercation between the two cops, with punches thrown and a gun being drawn.

Police say that officers Steven Sloan and Jeremy Ownbey, both members of the Denver Police Department since 2006, had gotten together, along with wives Stephanie Sloan and Jamie Ownbey, for an alleged swinger's party on May 19 at the Sloan's home in Aurora, Colorado. Both officers were off-duty at the time.

All parties were drinking alcohol when an argument began between the Sloans and the Ownbeys. The Sloans asked the Ownbeys to leave, but on their way out, Jamie Ownbey allegedly punched Stephanie Sloan. Steven, in defense of his wife, then punched Jamie. The two husbands then began to fight.

The altercation ended when Steven Sloan drew a handgun, prompting the Ownbeys to leave. Jeremy Ownbey later returned to the Sloan's house to talk to police, appearing visibly intoxicated and even admitting to police that he was drunk.

No sobriety tests were performed on Ownbey by the Aurora Police Department, who responded to the scene at 11:30pm that evening. Instead, officers drove Ownbey and his vehicle back to his home.

On Thursday, Jeremy and Jamie Ownbey were both charged with two 
counts of misdemeanor child abuse. Jamie was charged misdemeanor assault
 and Jeremy with trespassing.

The child abuse charges stem from the 
couple allegedly leaving their two small children alone at home while at the Sloan's residence for the party. According to police, the officers also failed to ask Jeremy who 
was watching his children while the party was taking place.

According to court documents obtained by KUSA, the argument began when Stephanie felt that Jamie had been disrespectful at different points in the evening. According to the documents, Stephanie told police that Jamie was 'forcing' her to drink tequila shots, and at one point had taken off her top, exposing her lace underwear.Â 

In court documents, Both Jeremy and Jamie Ownbey had been involved in previous swinging with Steven Sloan. Stephanie Sloan was not mentioned in the documents, prompting speculation that the party was an effort to convince Stephanie to join in swinging. Jamie told Aurora police that this was not the motivation.

The home where the alleged altercation took place. In addition to the two officers being placed on desk duty, the four Aurora police officers who failed to give Jeremy Ownbey a DUI test when he returned to the premises are under internal investigation

"We had a whole of 'he said, she said,'" Officer Frank Faria, a spokesman with the Aurora Police Department, told the Denver Post.

Court records show that the two officers went through police academy together and considered themselves 
to be close friends. According to the documents, Ownbey worked as a patrol officer, his beat being in downtown Denver. Sloan was a detective in traffic 
investigations. Both are currently on desk duty.

According to KUSA, Jamie Ownbey works as a secretary in a local school. She did not show up to work Thursday after being charged.
