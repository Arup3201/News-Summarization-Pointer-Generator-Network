As George Clooney is hours away from being ‘off the market’ it seems everyone wants a taste of the extravagant Venetian lifestyle.

The Oscar-winning actor is set to marry British human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, 36, in a civil ceremony in the palatial 14th century Ca' Farsetti palazzo on Monday. 

Today, the couple host a star-studded reception in the city's seven-star Aman Hotel on the Grande Canal, an occasion that Amal's parents reportedly insisting on paying for.

Research  has revealed that one in five people (18 per cent) want to visit the romantic city to experience the Italian waterways, just like the Clooneys to be.

A lastminute.com spokesperson said: ‘Not only is the Clooney wedding taking place there this weekend but we have also seen a last minute increase in searches for Brits wanting to visit this beautiful Italian city.

Security at both venues was being stepped up on Friday with staff at the Cipriani Hotel, once a favourite of Princess Diana, said to have been asked to sign strict confidentiality contracts before being issued with microchip passes to allow them access to and from the building.

It is the second time that Clooney will say 'I do' after he married actress Talia Balsam in a wedding officiated by an Elvis Presley impersonator in Las Vegas back in 1989.
