Riding Raisa: With apologies to the PM, the Mail has used computer technology to imagine who he might have looked riding Rebekah Brook's horse

Finally, from the horse’s mouth no less, the truth emerged yesterday about David Cameron and the ageing police horse loaned to Rebekah Brooks.

For days Downing Street had prevaricated over whether the Prime Minister had ever ridden the animal which has come to symbolise the dubious links between the Metropolitan Police and Rupert Murdoch’s News International.

Now Mr Cameron has confessed that the horse, named Raisa, was among those he rode while out with Mrs Brooks’s husband Charlie.

The admission came four days after it 
emerged that Mrs Brooks, the former Sun and News of the World editor 
arrested by police investigating phone-hacking and bribery, had been 
lent the 24-year-old retired Met horse between 2008 and 2010.

The Prime Minister’s official 
spokesman tried to laugh off the affair – inevitably dubbed ‘Horsegate’ –
on Wednesday, saying: ‘The only horses I am interested in are the type 
you can put a bet on. He has never been in a race in which I can back a 
horse.’

The following day Mr Cameron, a close 
friend and neighbour of the former newspaper executive and a fellow 
member of Oxfordshire’s so-called Chipping Norton Set, confirmed he had 
gone riding not with her but with her husband, a former racehorse 
trainer.

Mr Cameron also insisted he had not 
ridden the police horse, which has since died, since becoming Prime 
Minister but senior Tory sources indicated it was ‘possible, probable 
even’ that he had before coming to power.

At a press conference in Brussels 
yesterday Mr Cameron apologised for allowing a ‘confusing picture’ to 
emerge.

He told reporters that Raisa was among his mounts when he rode 
with Mr Brooks, a friend since they attended Eton.

‘I have not been riding with him since the election,’ said Mr Cameron. ‘Before the election, yes, I did go riding with him.

THURSDAY ‘It’s a matter of record that I have been riding with Rebekah Brooks’s husband, Charlie Brooks. He is a friend of mine of 30 years’ standing and a neighbour in my constituency so that’s a matter of record, but since I have been Prime Minister I think I have been on a horse once and it wasn’t that one.’ David Cameron

‘We don’t know if he has been on Raisa. Charlie has a lot of horses. It’s possible, probable even, that he has been on that one.’ Tory source

FRIDAY ‘I can categorically state that he never rode that horse. I do actually live there. It’s all rubbish.’ Jeremy Clarkson, News International columnist

‘I have not been riding with him (Charlie Brooks) since the election. Before the election, yes, I did go riding with him. He has a number of horses and, yes, one of them was this former police horse Raisa which I did ride. I am very sorry to hear that Raisa is no longer with us and I think I should probably conclude by saying I don’t think I will be getting back into the saddle any time soon.’David Cameron

‘He has a number of horses and, yes, one of them was this former police horse Raisa which I did ride.

‘I am very sorry to hear that Raisa 
is  no longer with us and I think I should  probably conclude by saying I
don’t think I will be getting back into the saddle any time soon.’

Horsegate has revived speculation 
about the Prime Minister’s closeness to Mrs Brooks, who quit as chief 
executive of News International at the height of the phone-hacking 
scandal last year.

Tory sources insist Mr Cameron has ‘no
recollection’ of riding with Mrs Brooks but according to former News of
the World feature writer Paul McMullan, the politician and the 
newspaper executive regularly went riding together.

He claims he was sent to ‘doorstep my ex-boss by hiding in the bushes, waiting for her to come past with Cameron on a horse’.

Mr Cameron attended the Brookses’ 
wedding in 2009 and the  ex-racehorse trainer is chairman of the 
Heythrop Hunt in Oxfordshire, which Mr Cameron has ridden with.

According to Vanity Fair magazine, Mr Cameron was so close to Mrs Brooks that he signed his  letters to her ‘love, David’.

News that she had been lent the horse 
the year after two people were jailed for phone hacking at her former 
paper, the News of the World, caused astonishment and a storm of Twitter
jokes.

The deal was struck after Mrs Brooks, 
currently on bail after being arrested last July, approached Dick 
Fedorcio – the Met’s head of public affairs.  He is currently on 
gardening leave pending an investigation into allegations of misconduct.

Most retired Met horses are put out to
grass at a horse charity in Buckinghamshire but some are loaned out to 
members of the public for a limited period.

Raisa was transported in 2008 to the 
Brookses’ sprawling Cotswolds home and the then editor of the Sun became
‘foster-carer’ for the animal.

But news of the horse ‘loan’ led to 
tensions between the Yard and Mrs Brooks when the Met, in a detailed 
statement released explaining the arrangement, accused her of handing 
back Raisa in a ‘poor but not serious’ condition. Mr Brooks retorted by 
insisting the animal had been impeccably treated.'

He declared: ‘I have been around and 
looked after horses all my  life and I am confident that I  know more 
about caring for  them than people at the Metropolitan Police.’

And Mr Murdoch also rode to the rescue
of his one-time protégée, tweeting: ‘Now they are complaining about R
Brooks saving an old horse from the  glue factory!’

To add to the confusion, Top Gear 
presenter Jeremy Clarkson – another member of the Chipping Norton Set  
and a columnist for the News International titles the Sun and Sunday 
Times – claimed that Mr Cameron had never ridden the horse in question.

Defence: Rupert Murdoch stood by former News International boss Brooks following the news she was loaned a horse

Before Mr Cameron’s admission, he told
Chris Evans on BBC Radio 2: ‘I can categorically state that he never 
rode that horse. I do actually live there. It’s all rubbish.’

According to Raisa’s entry on the 
National Equine database, she was a bay, born on January 1, 1986. 
Technically, the Yard has broken the database’s rules by failing to 
inform officials that the horse died in 2010.

At the Scottish Labour Conference in 
Dundee, Ed Miliband  said: ‘Today we learn that Cameron cannot even 
manage to be straight about riding a horse loaned to him by a News 
International executive.

‘The horse story may seem ridiculous. 
It is. But it is also becoming the symbol of how leading politicians got
too close to powerful media players.’

His deputy leader Harriet Harman said:
‘People will be dismayed that while News International was busy hacking
phones, David Cameron was out hacking with Rebekah Brooks’s husband.

‘David Cameron has not been straight 
about just how close he was to senior executives at News International 
and it’s time for him come clean about the extent of this relationship
