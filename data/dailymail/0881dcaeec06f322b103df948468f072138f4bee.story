A doctor at a border hospital in Reyhanli, Turkey, holds up a prosthetic hand being made for a baby who has fled the conflict in neighbouring Syria along with its family.

The hospital is caring for some of the 1.6million Syrian refugees who are estimated to have crossed the border since the start of the armed conflict in 2011. 

Turkey has one of the largest populations of Syrian refugees, and resources in border towns such as Reyhanli are being stretched near its limits.

Syria's conflict has left more than 210,000 people dead and 11.4 million displaced since it began in March 2011 with peaceful anti-government protests, eventually escalating into a full-blown civil war after the regime brutally cracked down on the demonstrations.

More than 12.2 million people in the war-torn country need life-saving aid and 3.9 million of those displaced have become refugees in neighbouring countries and further afield.

Last week, the The United Nations children's fund said Thursday that 14 million children are paying the price for warfare in Syria and neighbouring Iraq, with violence and hardship shaping their future.

'With the conflict in Syria now entering its fifth year, the situation of more than 5.6 million children inside the country remains the most desperate,' UNICEF said in a statement.

Turkey has one of the largest populations of Syrian refugees fleeing the ongoing civil war with official estimates currently at 1.6 million, and border towns such as Reyhanli have received a large number of refugees though other refugees have settled as far afield as Istanbul

The agency said up to two million children were living in areas of Syria largely cut off from humanitarian aid, and around 2.6 million children were out of school.

Almost two million Syrian children are living as refugees in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and other countries, 'in addition to the 3.6 million children from vulnerable communities' in the host countries, UNICEF said.

'For the youngest children, this crisis is all they have ever known. For adolescents entering their formative years, violence and suffering have not only scarred their past; they are shaping their futures,' said UNICEF chief Anthony Lake.

UNICEF said conflict in Iraq has also forced more than 2.8 million children from their homes.

At least 13 people were killed and 30 wounded as rebel and government forces exchanged fire in Syria's second city Aleppo earlier today.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor, put the death toll at 13, including five children.

The group reported at least 33 people wounded and said the death toll was expected to rise because of the number of seriously injured.

The Observatory said the rocket fire hit several neighbourhoods in the government-controlled west of Aleppo, and came a day after at least four people were killed in similar rebel fire.
