Police will go on strike in Calais tomorrow in protest at the vast influx of migrants ‘threatening public safety’ as they prepare to enter Britain.

In unprecedented scenes, members of France’s SGP-FO police and general workers’ union will call for more resources to cope with the growing number of foreigners.

‘The police can no longer provide for their own safety, let alone that of Calais,’ said Gilles Debove, spokesman for the union.

‘There are now between 2000 and 2500 migrants in the town, and this represents three per cent of the population of Calais.’

Mr Debove told AFP, France’s national news agency, that the crime rate was multiplying as mainly young men from countries like Eritrea, Sudan and Afghanistan live rough in the port.

Gang fights are common, while many steal food and other essential supplies before trying to board lorries and then ferries heading to Britain.

Mr Debove said tear gas and baton charges were regularly used to stop ‘mass onslaughts’ on vehicles about to cross the Channel.

The population of Calais has been invited to a demonstration on Monday, with police union members also calling for a traffic ‘go slow’ on main roads heading into the town.

Mr Debove added: ‘We are no way trying to stigmatize migrants. Our message is clear: this will be a pacifist and republican demonstration which will exclude any extremist organisation.’

Over the summer, Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart threatened to close the docks following an attempt by scores of mainly Eritreans and Sudanese to storm a ferry.

Ms Bouchart said she wanted ‘far more help from the British government’ to deal with people attempting to cross the Channel illegally.

The number of migrants in Calais has increased sharply in the past few months, and hundreds more are also camping out in other Channel ports including Dunkirk and Cherbourg.

All play a nightly game of cat-and-mouse with the police as they attempt to break into lorries so as to get to the UK.

The migrants are mainly from Somalia, Sudan and Eritrea, and have travelled from north Africa to mainland Europe, usually through Italy.

Violent clashes between rival migrant groups and people smugglers have also broken out in the town.

According to the Calais Prefecture, 7,414 undocumented migrants were arrested in Calais in the first six months of this year, compared with the 3,129 detained in the same period of 2013.
