A Walmart worker is facing charges of prostitution for allegedly 'soliciting sexual encounters' inside the store where he works in upstate New York.

Foster Bills, 22, was arrested after Walmart managers contacted state troopers to report that they had received 'an anonymous complaint of a male subject performing sexual acts in a secluded location' in the Queensbury store.

The 'secluded location' was apparently a Walmart bathroom.
