A woman has claimed that a group of prostitutes smashed her head against a brick wall in the bar of a lavish Florida hotel when they mistook her for competition.

Anna Burgese and her husband Joseph, from Medford, New Jersey, were visiting the W South Beach hotel in Miami Beach in January when the alleged incident occurred.

They said that rather than offering them assistance, staff at the hotel helped the prostitutes escape in taxis before police arrived, and have since been uncooperative with the police investigation.

The couple has now filed a civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Camden against Starwood Hotels & Resorts, which operates the swanky hotel.

Scene: Anna and Joseph Burgese claim she was attacked while staying at the W South Beach hotel

The couple was returning from a night at the hotel's club in the early hours of January 19 and started walking through the hotel's bar to reach the lobby and their rooms, the lawsuit claimed.

Their attorney, Lance Rogers, told theÂ Philadelphia Daily News that the bar is used by prostitutes to pick up men. The hotel is well known for these women who tout for business, the lawsuit added.

As they walked through the bar, Mrs Burgese was suddenly grabbed from behind, thrown face-first into a stone wall and then thrown to the ground, the lawsuit said.

As many as 10 women were involved, with some starting the attack, others witnessing it and more helping them escape the scene, Rogers said.

Mrs Burgese was treated for trauma to her face and knee at a nearby hospital.

Joseph Burgese said he learned that hotel staff he had asked to detain the prostitutes let them go and put them in a taxi before police arrived.

The lawsuit claims that a hotel staff member told him 'that they knew who the attackers were' but then later 'claimed ignorance as to the identity of the attackers'.

Since then, the hotel has also refused to cooperate, Rogers said. He said the hotel would not hand over surveillance footage of the attack. Police have so far made no arrests.

'The hotel has done absolutely nothing to help them and, in fact, has stood in the way of the process,' he said.

Helping hand: After the early-morning attack, staff allegedly put the women in cabs and did not ask for ID

Miami Beach police told the couple that the women were prostitutes and may have thought Mrs Burgese was 'another prostitute who was capturing business at the hotel', the lawsuit said.

It added that the hotel 'fosters a prostitute-friendly environment where prostitutes are permitted to market themselves on premises, as evidenced by, among other things, the reviews left on various travel websites by former guests.'

And 'as a result of the attacks, plaintiff Anna Burgese was seriously injured and suffered physical and mental anguish', it said.

Starwood Hotels & Resorts said: 'We truly regret that this incident occurred and that one of our guests was injured. Because of the pending litigation, we are unable to comment further at this time.'
