A few years ago, I said to my mother: ‘I want to start knitting again.’

‘What do you mean, again?’ she replied, looking panicky.

Decades may have passed, but both of us remembered the horror of my primary school knitting classes. The bad report cards, the black marks for misbehaving, the tearful trudge home with some misshapen  disaster, a woolly testament to my shame  and ineptitude.

‘We’ll give it to charity,’ mother would say, folding the unspeakable item in a drawer, never to be seen again. Oh, how I hated knitting  back then, the wool squeaky and tight with  flop sweat, the impenetrable instructions, the endless plain and purling.

Great fun: You can knit all sorts of creative things, such as this fried breakfast created in wool by Designer Kate Jenkins in Brighton

All that agony, for what? A grimy egg cosy at the end of term. A pair of mittens that appeared to have been mauled by kittens. Bah. I didn’t give knitting another thought for the next 30 or so years.

Then something happened to reawaken the woolly beast within. I really don’t know what. Perhaps it is just that I adore hand-knitted things; the simple beauty of moss stitch, the triumph of a home-made bobble hat, the love and care that goes into every cosy inch of baby’s first jumper or a pair of booties or a scarf for a friend.

In a world of fast and cheap fashion, of disposable clothes and gimcrack home-wares, knitting stands apart as something special: custom made, hand-crafted, rather beautiful and created by not much more than a pair of human hands and a bit of application. Could I do it myself? I certainly wanted to try.

And that’s when I discovered that knitting had changed. For a start, bamboo needles! Holy clickety-clack, who knew that needles had now been invented which made knitting easier and smoother for even the worst bungling amateur?

Also, knitting was no longer the sole preserve of the happily retired or the elderly, those dedicated few whipping up lacy sherbet lemon bed jackets or scratchy jumpers that no one wanted to wear.According to Deramores, one of the country’s biggest online retailers of all your knitting needs, the number of UK knitters has risen to more than 6.5 million since the recession hit in 2008.

Of that number, 70 per cent are  aged 45-plus — although there is a  growing surge in popularity among younger people.

Adorable: Nothing is more calming and fulfilling than knitting presents

With a wealth of beautiful patterns for covetable things, amazing yarns and even celebrity followers, knitting has come in from the cold.

Now, to encourage this renaissance, the Mail is giving readers a brilliant, free step-by-step beginner’s guide, starting today with a 32-page booklet and followed by seven collectable glossy pattern cards.

The guide includes basic techniques, advice about choosing yarns and gorgeous patterns for super-cute babies’ bonnets and booties, a chic cardigan, a colourful bobble hat and — for him — a fine-knit sweater and very smart scarf.

Hollywood actresses such as Julia Roberts, Kristin Davis and Sarah Jessica Parker are all keen knitters, while Uma Thurman, Geri Halliwell and even Madonna have all been seen busy with their own knitting projects.

British knitty celebrities such as TV presenters Kirstie Allsopp and Anthea Turner have also done their bit to popularise the craft.

This is all a reflection of a broader cultural shift, too. Not so long ago, knitting was frowned upon by feminists, who saw it as a symbol of female oppression and subjugation. If men weren’t knitting tea cosies and tank-tops, then why the hell were we? 

Yet over the past 20 years, the notion that to knit is somehow to demean oneself as a feminist crusader has itself become an anachronism.

Also, as more and more people turned towards growing their own vegetables, to bottling preserves and jams and to take pleasure in baking and cooking, knitting also found a new place at the table.Why not? For knitting is creative and productive.

The first time I knitted a hat, an actual wearable hat that someone could put on their head and walk down the street in without getting arrested, was one of the most thrilling moments of my life.

Like many, I am indebted to a new generation of knitting writers who not only produce wonderful, irresistible patterns for knitters of all abilities, but guide you from casting-on to the very last stitch.Bibs, toys, cute accessories, cashmere jumpers you’d actually want to wear, star-patterned baby blankets? It is all out there, begging to be knitted up. 

Step by step, I learned that knitting is nothing to fear. Also that natural wool is a beautiful thing — and a very forgiving medium to work in.

As Julia Roberts says, there is nothing more satisfying than turning a pile of yarn into a garment or a gift.

Of course, I could never be in my mother’s knitting league. She is  one of that generation of British women who learned to knit as a matter of course.

She baulks at nothing; impenetrable cable jumpers, the terrifying procedure known as ‘pick up and knit’, French knots, Swiss stitch, turning a heel? She can do the lot, without taking her eyes off Emmerdale.

Years ago, she knitted enough jumpers, hats and scarves to kit out our family. We just took it for granted. Now I can only gasp in admiration at her — and millions of women like her —  who possess these remarkable skills.

Two years ago, like thousands of Mail readers, Mum and I became obsessed with Fiona Goble’s  hilarious pattern book, Knit The Royal Family. It had detailed instructions on how to knit all the most important guests at the  wedding of Prince William and the then Kate Middleton — right down to the liveried footmen in their breeches and even the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan  Williams, complete with wispy mohair beard.

The £9.99 paperback had initially sold just over 800 copies, yet after being featured in the Mail, it became a smash, selling more than 50,000 copies in the weeks before the wedding.

It said something wonderful about the Mail’s knitty readership. Just give us the opportunity to knit a diddy-sized Prince Philip in 44 yards of beige double-knit yarn, complete with gold buttons and a gilt embossed hat, and we are there quicker than you can say: ‘Have I made his eyes too slitty?’

Since then, I’ve moved on. Oh yes. I’ve knitted dogs (there are instructions in the Mail’s step-by-step beginner’s guide to make a cute Dachshund). A pair of striped baby socks. I think I mentioned my hat. A Father Christmas, complete with sack of toys.

Oh yes. I’ve gained in confidence. I’ve learned that knitting is oddly relaxing. To focus on something small, like getting to the end of a row without making a mistake, is almost like meditating. There is a kind of sanctuary about it.

Knitters take refuge in repetition and numbers, and the consoling knowledge that it’s not a pointless pastime, it is a proper craft that will produce something lovely at the end.

Also it is good to know that learning to knit, or trying to improve one’s knitting skills, is an easily achievable goal.

It’s not like learning French or taking up the clarinet. It’s easy!

Sooner than you know it, you will be crossing the line between hesitant beginner and fluid, expert knitter.

Ahem, no, I haven’t quite got there myself yet. In fact, I haven’t quite got around to knitting anything bigger than a beany hat. But knit-wise, you just never know what might happen next.
