Wedged between the Louvre and the River Seine, it is one of the most beautiful public parks in the world, and a top spot for picnickers. 

But Paris's Tuileries Garden, which is invaded by tourists on a daily basis, is suffering from a different kind of infestation - by 'giant' rats.

The city-centre park, which was once the private garden of Marie Antoinette, has constantly suffered from a rodent problem, but during the summer, visitors flock to the grass and leave litter lying everywhere.

Infestation: Tourists bend down to look at the rats in the Tuileries Garden next to the Louvre in Paris

It causes the rats to arrive in huge numbers - picking up leftover food as they scurry between visitors.

Staff at the Louvre work with city authorities to keep the rodents under control, but last week it called in a pest control agency.

They are trying to use an 'ecological poison' to control the problem, but they say it has failed.

Gardener Audrey Hacherez told The Guardian: 'It's horrible, we're scared of being bitten.

'The tourists throw their scraps of pizza and sandwiches all over the place.'

Photographer Xavier Francolon captured around 30 of the rodents in the space of two days, some scampering with pieces of bread that had been left after picnics.

But he claims that most Parisians ignore the animals and continue to eat and relax in their presence. 

The garden was set up by French Queen Catherine de Medicis in 1564 in the grounds of the Tuileries Palace and became a public park after the French Revolution. 

During the 19th century, it was used by Napoleon Bonoparte for military parades but also became a focal point for Parisians who wanted to relax.

Paris's Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo has already tried to clear up the city's public gardens through a controversial smoking ban. 

It follows a new directive which allows bosses to ban wine in the work place – leading to accusations that the very heart of Gallic culture is under attack.

Scurrying: The rodent problems worsen during the summer because of an influx of picnickers 

Scraps: They have been caught running off with scraps of food left on the ground by visitors

Prevention: Gardeners claim they have used 'ecological poison' to control the problem - but it has not worked
