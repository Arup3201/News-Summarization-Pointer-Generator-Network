The Oscar-winning composer behind Jesus Christ Superstar is planning an even more ambitious scheme to connect the nation with its Christian heritage – wi-fi in every church.

Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose father was music director at a London church, said the initiative would put the increasingly deserted buildings back at the centre of their local communities.

The theatre impresario behind musicals including Cats and Evita has been in talks with Culture Minister Ed Vaizey, who is ‘actively’ considering the project.

In an interview in today’s Event magazine, Lord Lloyd Webber says: ‘I want to get every church in the country on wi-fi. Once you do that, it becomes at the centre of the community again.’

Under the scheme, local businesses and residents could get access to broadband beamed from the steeple or use their devices within the buildings.

The composer also suggests churches create apps that detail their hidden treasures, such as stained-glass windows, to boost visitors. 

Elsewhere in the interview, Lord Lloyd Webber discloses his admiration for Nicole Scherzinger, the former Pussycat Doll now starring in his revival of Cats.

Lord Lloyd Webber described Nicole Scherzinger as a 'babe' and 'the most exciting musical theatre artist I have found'

Describing her as a ‘babe’, he says: ‘I do believe she is the most exciting musical theatre artist I have found – well, that I have worked with – in very, very many years. I really do.’

Welcoming the wi-fi plans, the Bishop of Norwich, the Rt Rev Graham James, said his diocese was already using steeples to provide broadband to remote areas, adding: ‘It’s an imaginative way of using our huge network of ancient buildings for community purposes.’

Mr Vaizey said he was already rolling out a programme to equip 1,000 public buildings with broadband and was now thinking of ways to extend it to churches, perhaps with a fund they could apply to.

He added: ‘We are keen to ensure our heritage is preserved.’
