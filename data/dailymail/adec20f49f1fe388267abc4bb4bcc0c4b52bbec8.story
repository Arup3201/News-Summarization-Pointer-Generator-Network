Cinderella story: Welsh-born Princess Lilian of Sweden died on March 10, aged 97

Princess Lilian of Sweden, wife of the late Prince Bertil, was buried in a state ceremony in Stockholm on Saturday.

The Welsh-born beauty, who married into Sweden's royal family after a 33-year secret romance with her prince, was laid to rest in the royal cemetery in Haga on the outskirts of the Swedish capital.

Princess Lilian died at the age of 97 as one of the most loved members of the royal family, despite three decades living hidden from the public.

Lillian May Davies grew up in Swansea in Wales, the daughter of miner William Davies and Gladys Mary Curran, a shop assistant.

She moved to London aged 16, and worked as a model and actress before the war, removing the second 'l' from her name to appear more glamorous.

In 1940, at the height of the Blitz, she married Scottish actor Ian Craig shortly before he was called into the military.

Three years later she was working in a factory, making radios for the Marines, and at a hospital for injured soldiers in the capital.

Shortly before her 28th birthday she threw a cocktail party to celebrate her big day. One of the guests was a handsome Swedish naval attaché - Prince Bertil.

When her husband returned from service in 1945 - in love with an Italian woman - the pair amicably divorced and Lilian moved to Sweden.

Prince Bertil and Princess Lilian lived together for more than three decades before they were allowed to marry in 1976.

When Lilian divorced in 1945, the beauty and her playboy prince were set to marry upon her arrival in Sweden, but disaster struck.

Bertil's brother Gustav Adolf, Sweden's heir to the 
throne, died in a plane crash in 1947, leaving his infant son Crown Prince Carl Gustaf next in line to wear the crown.

With an elderly monarch and a toddler crown prince, the possibility that Bertil would have to act as monarch until Crown Prince Carl Gustaf came of age became a reality.

Bertil was simply told a marriage to a commoner and divorcee, which would see him waive his right to the throne, was not on the cards.

Bertil's other older brother Sigvard 
had already waived his right to the throne by marrying a commoner, 
leaving Bertil and Lilian with no choice.

For the next 33 years Lilian lived 
hidden from the public, very few knew she even existed. The Swedish 
Royal family made a deal with the press not to mention her name, and she
was not allowed to accompany Prince Bertil on any official duties.

On her 80th birthday in 1995, she said: 
'If I were to sum up my life, everything has been about my love... He's a
great man, and I love him.'

King Carl XVI Gustaf ascended the Swedish 
throne in 1973 and after his marriage in 1976 to commoner Silvia 
Sommerlath, Lilian and Bertil could finally become an official couple.

Their wedding took place just months after the King and Queen's, in December 1976.

Prince Bertil kept his title and the miner's daughter from Wales became a princess.

'We only regret one thing,' Prince 
Bertil said after the wedding,' And that is that we were not able to get
married sooner and have children.'

Despite never having any of her own, Lilian was very close to the royal children and Prince Carl Philip was her godson.

Princess Lilian was active until just a few years before 
death and, like her husband, had a keen interest in sports.

When asked what the secret to her long 
life was the great lover of practical jokes put it down to laughter, 
rather than exercise.

‘She 
was a true bringer of happiness and had the ability always to create 
around her a warm and kind atmosphere,’ King Carl Gustaf said in a statement last week.

‘The family's children always appreciated her jokes and humorous ways.’

Prince Bertil died aged 84 in 1997, with his wife by his side. She will now rest next to him at the
Royal Cemetery at Haga, Stockholm.

The royal palace has not given a cause
of death for the Princess, but it has been known since 2010 that Lilian suffered from Alzheimer's disease
and had been in ill health for several years.
