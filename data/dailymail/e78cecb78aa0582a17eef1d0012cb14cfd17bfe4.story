There was a serious case of bad dresses on good bodies at the Golden Globes last night.

From Lucy Liu in what could only have been inspired by wallpaper, to Emily Mortimer's sequined style sin, the stylists in charge should surely be sacked.

Halle Berry, who has one of the most sensational figures in Tinseltown, failed to impress on the red carpet in a cutaway printed gown.

Overexposed: Halle Berry, who has one of the most sensational figures in Tinseltown, failed to impress on the Golden Globes red carpet in a cutaway printed Versace gown

The design, by Versace, appeared to 
have been carelessly sliced apart at the midriff and thigh, and the 
bodice seemed far too tight, even on a waist as slim as Halle's.

The split in the dated pink printed 
skirt did at least allow the star to do her best impression of 
'Angelina's leg', and the nude court shoes were, at least, an elegant, 
understated choice.

Lucy Liu's Carolina Herrera gown also stood out for all the wrong reasons.

While the smiling star no doubt felt 
like a princess in the full-skirted Carolina Herrera gown - and we 
applaud her risk-taking - the print seemed to be more appropriate for 
wallpaper or a tablecloth than an evening gown.

Sienna Miller - usually a regular on the best-dressed list - fell short for us this evening too.

The wallpaper look: Lucy Liu's Carolina Herrera gown stood out for all the wrong reasons

Arm candy: The only saving grace of Jennifer Westfeldt's confusing look was that she arrived on the arm of Jon Hamm (left). Eva Longoria's Emilio Pucci gown had too-deep splits at the chest and thigh (right)

She said she wanted to support 
British fashion, so selected a gown by Erdem. And while the look is sure
 to impress fashion insiders, it didn't do many favors for her figure.

The top part sat awkwardly on her 
bust, and was positioned slightly off-center above the column skirt. On 
the plus side, the simple hair and make-up was a wise choice with a busy
 print - the soft pink lip, in particular, looked fresh and pretty.

Unfortunately little could save Emily
 Mortimer's look. The silver sequin gown was just that little bit too 
tight and clung in all the wrong places.

Missing the mark: Nene Leakes looked ready for 
work in her bizarre shirt-dress (left) while Julia Louis-Dreyfus was 
channeling 1991 in her dated gown (right)

Perhaps it would have worked if the 
neckline were not as high and the cut not quite as austere, but on this 
occasion there was nothing to save it. Perhaps Emily's serious 
expression indicates that she knows this all too well.

It was an issue shared by Rosario Dawson, though, whose powder-blue peplum added unnecessary bulk to her otherwise slim frame.

Nene Leakes - who has successfully 
elevated her profile from Real Housewife to serious actress with roles 
in Glee and The New Normal - made an unlikely choice in a shirt-style 
dress.

The full skirt 
could not save it from looking too office-like to be a real success 
though, and for such a flamboyant personality, the expectations for a 
fun choice were higher.

Unflattering: Rosario Dawson (left) and Emily Mortimer (right) wore dresses that failed to do their slim figures favors. Sienna Miller's gown is sure to please fashionistas, but looks awkward to the average eye (center)

At the other end of the scale, though, was actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, whose corseted gown with layers of brown chiffon and black lace looked like a design from circa 1991 - and not in a good way.

Nicole Richie was another starlet 
who missed the mark on the red carpet in a floor length gown that looked
 slightly as if it had been made out of pale blue curtains.

An over fussy pattern, combined with a high neck and long sleeve swamped the petite stars tiny frame.

Over-the-top: Nicole's intricately patterned dress and thick blue eyeshadow did the petite star no favours

The reality-star-turned-designer also was sporting some less than flattering make- up; seemingly having gone a little overboard with the fake tan.

The slightly orange hue and heavy blue eye makeup served to make the 31-year-old look far older than her years.

Zosia Mamet was another star who seriously misjudged her makeup.

Perhaps taking her role as the virginal prude in Girls a little too far, she ruined a stunning fitted black gown by completely abstaining from any makeup or accessories.

With her hair pull back too tightly and looking a little greasy she looked decidedly drab and dull next to her glamorous red carpet companions.

Both Jessica Alba (right) and Zosia Mamet (left) wore elegant classic cut dresses, but both managed to spoil their look; Alba with her creature-like bag, and Zosia with a decided lack of make-up and jewelry

Jessica Alba similarly managed to detract from a stunning dress with some poor accessory choices.

While her bold salmon coloured dress wowed crowds and set of her skin tone perfectly, the look was let down by her furry clutch bag.

Closely resembling a muppet, the furry monstrosity looked like it may jump to life at any minute, and rather detracted from the otherwise polished look.

Breaking Bad’s Anna  Gunn suffered a serious bad hair day. While her dress was a bit of a frock horror it was her dodgy 80s hair that needed work.

Her ‘do’ suggested she was dragged through a bush on the way over to the awards or simply misplaced her hair brush.

A safer bet would have been some sleek finger waves or a more polished do like Amy Adams or Hedi Klum.

From top to toe: Kerry Washington (right) seems to have forgotten the end of her dress, while Anna Gunn's (left) hair looks like she had an altercation with a rather angry rose bush on her way to the awards

Kerry Washington is usually a staple of ‘best dressed’ lists, but last night she seemed to have left the bottom of her dress at home.

Her sheer nude dress ticked all the right boxes from the knees upwards, but there was some seriously unflattering ankle flapping happening from the usually stylish beauty.

That being said, there weren't too 
many fashion faux pas at the Golden Globes this year.

Perhaps years of attacks from fashion police has taught the A-list that it is wiser to play it safe in flattering black and ethereal beiges 
and nudes.

Thank goodness there are still a few who are brave enough to give us something to talk about.
