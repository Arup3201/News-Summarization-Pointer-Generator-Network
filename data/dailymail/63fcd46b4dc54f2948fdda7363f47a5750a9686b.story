A new brutally-honest style series set to premiere on TLC this evening will see a group of fashion-challenged individuals being critiqued by a jury of strangers, before being given a much-needed makeover by two style experts. 

In tonight's debut episode of Style By Jury, which is presented by British fashion expert Louise Roe and American Eagle's Style Director Preston Konrad, a 44-year-old mother-of-one receives a damning appraisal from the show's panel of critics, who are hidden behind a two-way mirror, with one comparing her look to that of a 'homeless person', while another questions whether she has 'stolen her husband's old clothes'.

'I like to be comfortable, I like to be casual,' the show's first 'fashion offender', Sloane, who was nominated to appear on the show by her cousin, tells Louise. 'My size dictates what I wear.'

Fashion victim: Sloane, 44, is the first person to be critiqued by a brutally-honest hidden style jury

'I got lazy': The mother-of-one confesses to host Louise Roe that she gave up caring about what she looked like and how she dressed

Dressed in a baggy, oversized orange T-shirt and a pair of distressed, worn jeans, which are riddled with holes, Sloane's less-than-stylish appearance prompts a series of shocked responses from the jury, who are remain hidden - and unheard - behind a concealed mirror.

'She looks dumpy,' one juror says, while another adds: 'She looks like she's getting ready to do some hard labor.'

One particularly brutal juror goes as far as to say that Sloane's baggy clothing makes her look as though stolen 'the old stuff that her husband was donating to Goodwill', prompting her colleague to state: 'She looks homeless, that's what I want to say.' 

Sloane confesses that she has lost any and all motivation to make an effort when it comes to her appearance. 

'I don't wear lipstick at all,' she admits. 'I might wear Chapstick, but that's it.

'My holey jeans are my favorite jeans. I can wear those for about everything. Those are my casual jeans, those are my dress-up jeans. I just maybe might try and put a nicer T-shirt on that might be a little bit more fancy.' 

'She's ready for hard labor!' A hidden panel of critics assesses Sloane's look and delivered a series of damning verdicts about her appearance

A hole load of problems: Sloane wears this pair of ripped jeans - her favorite pair - for any and all occasions, be they smart or casual 

But while Sloane doesn't take much interest in anything to do with fashion or beauty, she confesses that her husband, whom she has been married to for 11 years, and their 11-year-old daughter, have both grown frustrated with her overly laid-back appearance.

'[My daughter] is a little embarrassed about [how I dress],' she says, before adding: '[My husband] thinks I'm frumpy. He loves me but... 

'I don't go anywhere. I work, I'm a mom. I do stop myself from going out to dinner with my husband, I'll make up excuses not to go out with my girlfriends. 

'It might be a lot of times that I'm lazy... I don't find it important, the way I look.'

But Louise, 33, is unimpressed with Sloane's excuses. 

'You basically implied that you don't need to, and you shouldn't have to, make the effort because you work and you're a mom,' she says. 'So, you must be the only person in the world who works and is also a mom, right?'

Giving evidence: Sloane's cousin Sierra steps forward as a witness and tells Louise exactly why she feels her cousin is in need of a makeover

Then and now: Sierra explains that Sloane was 'absolutely beautiful' as a twenty-something, but that she let herself go following the death of her mother

After delivering her own damning appraisal of Sloane's sense of style, Louise calls her cousin and close friend Sierra to the Style By Jury witness stand in order to present her evidence for why Sloane is so desperately in need of a makeover.

'She is just so beautiful and it just doesn't present itself on the outside,' she explains. 'I know it, I know what's there, but on the outside you would never see it.'

Sierra goes on to describe the series of tragic events in Sloane's life which she believes have lead to her becoming so disinterested in her outward appearance - adding that, during her early 20s, Sloane was 'amazing beautiful on the outside'. 

'I think that a lot of stuff has happened in her life, one being her mother passing away,' Sierra tells Louise. 'And I think, hoenstly, from that moment on, she hasn't been the same. 

'It has shown in the way she dresses, in her appearance.' 

Showing Louise an image of a glamorous-looking Sloane at age 20, Sierra adds: 'She was amazingly beautiful on the outside [when we were younger]. Everywhere we went, guys were after her.'

On the stand: Sierra explains to Louise that she wants her cousin to look as beautiful on the outside as she is on the inside

Surprise! Sloane is shocked to discover that a hidden panel has been assessing her appearance

Baby steps: The first part of her makeover sees Sloane forced to try on a skin-tight body suit so that she can 'learn where her waistline truly is'

The black and white image, which shows Sloane posing seductively, while wearing a flattering low-cut top, prompts gasps of shock from the jury - and from Louise, who then reveals to Sloane that a hidden jury has been appraising her look since she walked into the room. 

She reveals to Sloane exactly what harsh criticism the jurors voiced about her appearance when she first walked into the room, leaving the mother-of-one in tears. 

'I'm not too shocked by a lot of what they said,' she tells Louise. 'I want my daughter to be proud of me. I want her to see mommy happy, and like herself and think that she's beautiful.' 

Sloane is then taken off to begin her makeover process - which starts with Louise and Preston forcing her into a skin-tight body suit, so that she can 'learn where her waistline truly is' and discover which parts of her body she can accentuate with the help of some new clothing. 

'This is my kick in the butt,' Sloane tells the camera. 'This is what I need.'

After undergoing a series of rigorous style lessons, Sloane, and her brand new look, will then be presented to a new jury, who will give their own verdict on her revitalized appearance.
