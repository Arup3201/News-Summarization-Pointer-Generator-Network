'She believes that her daughter is being held hostage and is asking everyone to pray for her.'

Family and friends have been unable to contact the young woman, who was believed to have arrived at the cafe at 9am.

She has been described as a 'sweet girl'.

The family and friends of other hostages have also expressed their concern and desperation as up to 50 people continue to be held in the cafe for around eight hours.

A family friend of another hostage told Daily Mail Australia they were in the dark about what was going on.

'We weren't told anything at all and we heard there was a place for family to sit and wait but [officers] didn't know anything about it,' the family friend said.

'But then again how do they [officers] know we are for real [actually family]?' 

Witnesses have described the frantic scene leading up the siege, saying they heard screams before police swarmed Martin Place.

Office workers have been evacuated from buildings in the nearby vicinity as police continue to warn the public to avoid the area

One or two men were seen walking into the café and pulling a weapon from a blue bag at about 9:45 this morning.

Rodrigo Neryt said he was arriving at Channel 7 for his first day of work experience when he heard screaming out the front of the café.

'I was at the corner when everything started. I saw people yelling and screaming and two police cars arriving at the scene,' Mr Neryt told Daily Mail Australia.

'I saw what looked like a black ISIS flag and they were holding it up.'

Police spent a large part of the morning evacuating office workers from buildings in the local vicinity.
