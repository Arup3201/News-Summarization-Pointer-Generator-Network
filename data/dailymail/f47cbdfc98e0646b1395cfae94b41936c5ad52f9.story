A bull earmarked for slaughter because it is gay has been saved by The Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon as the terminal cancer sufferer continues to spend his $100million fortune on animal rights causes.

Benjy, an Irish bull in County Mayo, Ireland, had been facing slaughter for being gay after a veterinarian declared his sexual orientation the reason he wouldn't breed.

But when The Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon heard of his fate, he put up £5,000 to buy Benjy and transport him to a sanctuary where he will now live out his natural life in peace.

The bull's transfer is expected to take place in time for Christmas.

Simon, who is also a long-time vegan, said: 'PETA told me about Benjy, and I felt compelled to help. All animals have a dire destiny in the meat trade, but to kill this bull because he's gay would've been a double tragedy.

'It thrills me to help PETA and ARAN make Benjy's fate a sanctuary rather than a sandwich.'

Simon was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2012 and has chosen to use his money and the time he has left to help animals in need.

This includes getting 17 bears transferred from virtually barren concrete pits to a lush new home, helping retire a lame horse used for racing and securing the transfer of a chimpanzee who had spent more than 18 years in solitary confinement at a zoo to a reputable sanctuary.

He also runs The Sam Simon Foundation, an organisation dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating homeless dogs.

Given three months to live in 2012, Simon immediately decided to team up with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) president Ingrid Newkirk, and dedicate his time to the rescue of maltreated animals and conservation.

Having defied that diagnosis’ original death sentence, Simon continues to push ahead and has also funded projects such as 'Feeding Families' to help with the underprivileged in inner cities.

And now, as he enters the twilight of his life, has declared himself never happier and finally at peace.

Simon has no children and is not married so he wants to give his millions to causes he cares about. He was married to actress Jennifer Tilly in the 1980s but divorced in 1991 though they remain close. 

In addition to the money fronted by Simon, more than 250 other individuals have donated to fund the bull's transfer via a crowd-funding initiative set up by Irish animal-protection group ARAN and TheGayUK.com.

Simon recently told NBC that Ingrid Newkirk, the founder of PETA, created a 'therapy' for him.

'We planned and are still planning a series of animal liberations and actions that I get to participate in and enjoy. It gives me something to look forward.

'I get to watch these animals that have been in concrete bunkers their whole lives take their first step on grass.'
