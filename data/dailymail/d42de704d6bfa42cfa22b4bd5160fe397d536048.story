The North Carolina man who was trapped under his SUV for 17 hours after it tumbled 60-feet off a cliff is recovering well after having his leg amputated.

Joe Woodring, 21, fell asleep at the wheel driving last month in Boone when he came off the road and came to found pinned under the car for almost a day until someone heard his cries and phoned 911.

During his ordeal he managed to survive by making a pillow out the grass he was surrounded by and used his pocket knife to cut the lining of the seat to make a blanket.

'From the time it stopped (rolling), he was awake and conscious,' said his aunt Trish Miller to ABC News.

'He was very smart. He caught rain water in a little can to drink.....he's definitely a survivalist.'

Following on from the October 28 crash, Woodring has been recovering at the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

As part of that process doctors unfortunately couldn't save his leg and it was amputated above the knee.

He is currently undergoing physical therapy and should be able to return home back to his grandfather in two weeks.

'When we comes home, he'll be in a wheelchair for a while,' said his grandmother, Tempie Ruth Woodring to ABC News. 'Then they'll work on getting him a leg.'

While he continues his recover, Joe has told his family that the thing he misses the most is hunting.

"He and my oldest son, Ethan, they're best friends and they had been planning their hunting strategies for this year," Miller said. "So this has put a damper on that but they're looking forward to next year."

"He knows it's going to be a rough road for a while," she added. "But he knows he's going to be able to walk again. He's got that drive. And technology today is limitless."
