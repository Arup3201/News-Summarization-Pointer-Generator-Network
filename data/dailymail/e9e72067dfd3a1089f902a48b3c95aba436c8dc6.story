Two girls high school basketball teams have been suspended from a regional tournament after both of them tried to lose a game.

The ridiculous game between Riverdale High School and Smyrna High School, both in Tennessee, took place on Saturday in front of bemused spectators and referees.

Both teams knew that losing the game would mean avoiding having to play nationally-ranked Blackman High School in an elimination match.

The losing team would be placed on the other side of the regional bracket and would have a better chance of making it to the Region 4-AAA finals.

Both teams had already been beaten by Blackman earlier in the season.

Referees and spectators looked on as players on both teams deliberately missed free throws and were penalized for numerous violations

The game descended into a farce as players deliberately missed free throws, while numerous 10-second and half-court violations occurred.

'One time a Riverdale girl looked at one of the officials and gave the official a 3-second signal wanting him to call three seconds on her. Smyrna stood in the lane as well to have us call three seconds on them,' The Daily News Journal reported the referee saying.

He also noted that Riverdale 'missed 12-16 free throws intentionally', and Smyrna 'wouldn't get the ball across the half-court line to get a 10-second count or to make us call an over and back violation intentionally'.

The referee had had enough when a Smyrna player was about to deliberately attempt a shot at the wrong basket.

'That was when I called both coaches together and told them we are not going to make a travesty or mockery of the game.'

'We are not going to start trying to shoot and score for the other team.'

Trevor Goodson who runs TeamSlink, a program that girls play basketball at college level, was at the game and filmed some of the ridiculous plays.  

On Twitter he said: 'This is disgusting and it's making both schools look bad.... I sure hope both coaches come out in the 2nd half w/ a change of heart.' 

The decision by the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (TSSAA) to suspend the teams came after the referee reported the incident. 

The Rutherford County schools were subsequently placed on restrictive probation by the high school association for the rest of the academic year and are on probation for the 2015-16 year.

Both schools have also been fined $1,500.

Trevor Goodson, who runs a program that helps girls get into college level basketball, was appalled by what he witnessed on the court that night

Principal Rick Powell of Smyrna and Principal Tom Nolan of Riverdale met with TSSAA officials to ask that their teams be allowed to continue to play.

They instead suggested removing the respective coaches, Shawn Middleton at Smyrna and Cory Barrett at Riverdale, for the remainder of the season.

However TSSAA executive director Bernard Childress stuck by the decision to suspend the teams saying that it was derived from the actions of the players on the court.

'The student athletes bought into it,' Childress said. 'They were the ones asking to call three seconds. They were the ones stepping back over [midcourt]. They were the ones not attempting to shoot at the basket.'

Both coaches have been suspended until the end of the 2015-2016 school year and neither is allowed to have any role in athletics in Rutherford County.

Both schools appealed for their teams to be allowed to continue to play, but the local athletic association ruled that the student athletes had bought into the scheme to intentionally lose the game

Rutherford County Director of Schools Don Odom said in a statement: 'Rutherford County Schools apologizes to the Riverdale and Smyrna High basketball players and parents for the lack of leadership exhibited by two of our coaches last Saturday evening in the district consolation game.'

'Players lost opportunities to compete in a regional tournament, lost opportunities for all-tournament status and to showcase their individual talents to collegiate scouts.'

'We also apologize to the citizens of Rutherford County because of the embarrassment generated locally and nationally for teams motivated to throw a game.'

The game eventually ended 55-29 with Smyrna winning. 

The suspensions meant that Tullahoma, who were scheduled to play Riverdale, advanced to the Region 4-AAA semifinals without play. Lawrence County, scheduled to play Smyrna, also advanced.
