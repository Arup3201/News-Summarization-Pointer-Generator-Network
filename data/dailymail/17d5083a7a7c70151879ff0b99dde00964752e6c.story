Pledge: The rising numbers suggest David Cameron's promise to keep net migration below 100,000 is running into trouble

Net migration in Britain is on the rise – driven by workers from Spain and other southern Europe countries fleeing the collapse of their eurozone economies, figures have shown.

Net migration – the touchstone figure that shows how migration is affecting the population as a whole – went up by 15,000 to 182,000 in the year to June, the Office for National Statistics said yesterday.

The increase was the second quarterly rise in a row, suggesting that David Cameron’s pledge to cut net migration to below 100,000 is running into trouble.

The breakdown from the ONS showed that ministers are succeeding in reducing the numbers of migrants from outside Europe.

But
a new wave of workers are now coming from longstanding southern EU 
member countries, with European treaties stopping the Government from 
restricting the flow.

Yesterday’s
figures revealed that 118,000 EU citizens came to work in Britain in 
the year to June, more than the number of workers from outside Europe.

This included 37,000 Poles as well as workers from other eastern European countries.

But
the ONS pointed to a ‘statistically significant’ increase in the number
coming from other parts of Europe, notably from countries in southern 
Europe.

Workers from the 15 
longest-established EU nations, including Spain, Portugal, Italy and 
Greece, went up from 41,000 in the year to June 2012 to 59,000 in the 12
months to June this year.

Some
27,000 came from Spain, 10,000 up on working immigrants from the 
country in the previous year. Spain has now shot up to sixth on the 
league table of the countries sending migrants to Britain. Separate 
figures showed an increase of 52 per cent in new National Insurance 
numbers issued to Italian citizens, 45 per cent to Portuguese nationals,
40 per cent to Spanish nationals, and 31 per cent to Greeks.All
four countries have been hit by the eurozone crisis, experiencing high 
levels of unemployment and a deep credit squeeze. The ONS revealed that 
overall, there were 503,000 immigrants in the year to June – down from 
517,000 in the previous year.

The figures also showed that Home Office limits on student visas have cut the numbers coming into the country to study.

More people now say they come to Britain for work-related reasons than any other

The wealth gap between Europe's richest and poorest countries creates an 'overwhelming incentive' for people to move to Britain, Theresa May has warned.

The Home Secretary suggested new EU member states would have to increase income levels at home before border the UK was forced to open its borders to them.

She insisted the government was acting to 'address the pull factors that drive up immigration'.

Benefits rules are being changed, with welfare payments ending after six months if someone has no prospect of finding work.

But Mrs May added: 'Whatever the Government does in terms of reducing the pull factors that draw people to Britain, as long as there is such an enormous disparity between EU member states in terms of income per head, there will be an overwhelming incentive for people to move from poorer member states to richer member states.

'That not only puts pressure on communities in countries like Britain, it robs poorer EU member states of their most talented people,' she wrote for PoliticsHome.

'So in future, we must put in place new arrangements to slow full access to each other’s labour markets until we can be sure it will not lead to mass migration. This could, for example, be achieved by requiring new member states to reach a certain level of income or economic output per head before full free movement is allowed.'

Around 176,000 students arrived in the year to June, down from a peak of nearly 250,000 in 2008.

And
the number of students coming in to the country has fallen under the 
number of migrants coming here to work for the first time in four years.

However
net migration, the number by which migration pushes up the population 
after emigration has been taken into account, was up to 182,000 compared
to 167,000 in the year to June 2012.

Sir
Andrew Green, of the MigrationWatch think-tank, said: ‘The Government’s
immigration policy is succeeding in reducing net migration from outside
the EU, now down by over a third to its lowest level since 1998.

‘But
the recent increase in migration from the EU will render it still more 
difficult to achieve their target. A continuing problem is the low 
outflow of non-EU migrants which has been steady at around 100,000 for 
ten years despite inflows of 300,000 or more for most of the period.

‘A very significant part of this is students who have been arriving at an annual rate of 139,000 over the last five years.’

Sir
Andrew added that none of the restrictions already placed on 
immigration seemed to be harming the economy, as some people had 
predicted. He said: ‘There is no evidence that the immigration policy is
constraining economic activity.’

With
British labour market restrictions about to end on citizens from 
Bulgaria and Romania, the two countries that joined the EU in 2007, EU 
migration was high on the agenda for Mr Cameron as he met fellow leaders
at a summit in Lithuania yesterday.

And Home Office Immigration Minister Mark Harper insisted that the Government was working to bring net migration down.

But,
with the two most recent sets of quarterly figures both showing net 
migration on the rise, he chose not to repeat Mr Cameron’s promise to 
get numbers down to 1990s levels of below 100,000.

‘Our
reforms are working and immigration continues to fall,’ Mr Harper said.
‘We have tightened immigration routes where abuse was rife, but are 
still encouraging the brightest and best to come here to study and work.

‘Net
migration has fallen by nearly a third since its peak in 2010 and 
across the Government we are working hard to bring it down further.’
