Young tennis star Nick Kyrgios enjoyed several feisty exchanges with the crowd during an intense round four clash with Italy's Andreas Seppi at the Australian Open.

But now the scrappy 19-year-old is facing accusations that he should have been disqualified after he swore at members of the crowd during Sunday's match.

As fans packed the Hisense Arena on day seven at the Australian Open, the Canberra teenager delivered an early Australia Day celebration with a victory at Melbourne Park.

But midway through the match he yelled out 'turn off your f***ing phone mate' after a loud ringtone echoed through Hisense Arena.

Later, when someone yelled out during a crucial serve deep in the fifth set he caustically fired off: 'Are you right, mate?' after losing the point.

He also spotted  three spectators trying to sneak out early before he went on to stage a miracle comeback after a five-set triumph.

In the heat of the moment, Kyrgios interrupted his own match as he called out at the fans: 'Oi! Where are you going?' as the crowd laughed.

With the roaring crowd yelling out 'boo' at the three fans, they immediately seated themselves back down as they giggled and appeared humiliated.

Nick Kyrgios served his way out of trouble to advance to the last eight with a 5-7 4-6 6-3 7-6(5) 8-6 win

Christopher Clarey from the New York Times wrote that the 19-year-old was lucky his temper and language didn't earn him a disqualification.

'If chair umpire Fergus Murphy had better hearing or had applied the letter of the tennis law, Kyrgios could have been disqualified for three code-of-conduct violations on the first Sunday: just as John McEnroe was 25 years ago in the same round of the 1990 Australian Open,' Mr Clarey wrote.

'Instead, Kyrgios got just one warning after spiking his racket when he lost the first set. But there was plenty more negative energy as well as energy, period, on display.'

Kyrgios served his way out of trouble to notch a magical 5-7 4-6 6-3 7-6(5) 8-6 win to overcome the Italian, who had upset Swiss superstar Roger Federer in the third round.

But in his post-match interview the 19-year-old stayed coy about his recent flirty Twitter exchange with Victoria Azarenka.

Taking a break from the court on Saturday, Kyrgios asked fans to shoot him some questions. After some pretty standard chit chat, former women's world number one Azarenka decided to get in on the action, and she didn't hold back.

'How can I learn to serve as big as you?,' Azarenka flirtatiously asked the young tennis ace.

A cheeky, quick-witted Kyrgios immediately shot back: 'Private lessons of course'.

Clearly enjoying their playful banter, Azarenka tweeted back an emoji-filled reply, hinting that the pair may carry on their conversation in private.

'Okay I'll book one,' Azarenka said.

On Sunday Kyrios was asked if he would be giving any lessons to Azarenka on his day off.

The 19-year-old raised his eyebrows and smirked before laughing awkwardly and replying: ‘I don’t know, let’s be honest. No comment, no comment.’

Last Australian standing at the tennis tournament and the first to reach the quarter-finals since a decade ago by Lleyton Hewitt, Kyrgios will face grand slam champion Andy Murray on Tuesday.

Making his way into the history books, Kyrgios battled his own demons to progress into a last-eight showdown to become the youngest player in the men's quarter-finals since Andrei Cherkasov in 1990.

Contesting just his seventh grand slam event, the Canberra excitement machine is also the first teen to make the last eight of two majors since the great Federer.

'It feels so good,' Kyrgios said after the match.

'The crowd was unbelievable. 

'I honestly didn't think I was going to come back and win that match. I was just going to hang in - this is incredible.

'This is my favourite court I've ever played on.'

Kyrgios' dad made an appearance after the match, saying how proud he was of his son.

'Unbelievable. Unbelievable. I just want to thank all the crowd - it's just unbelievable. They just got him over the line - kept him motivated,' Mr Kyrgios said.

'Thank you everybody - much appreciated and hope we could just go one more.

When asked if he believed his son could pull through after being two-sets to love down, he responded: 'With the crowd pushing the way it was - his done it before - so his done it again.

'You got one more point to play I'd say. Just give it the best shot and it seems to be working for him so unbelievable.'

His mobility restricted and explosive power diminished, Kyrgios obliterated a racquet at one point, such was his frustration at being unable to compete at full capacity early on. 

Seppi won the opening set after breaking Kyrgios to love in the 11th game.

Kyrgios grew more and more frustrated as he squandered multiple break points in the fourth game of the second set, almost apologetically telling spectators: 'I'm trying man. I can't walk, though.'

After fending off a break point in the fifth game, Kyrgios couldn't hold the Italian out again and found himself in a deep, deep hole after dropping serve for a second time in the ninth game - and then the second set.

But Kyrgios began to mount his stirring fightback as his back appeared to free up in the third set, which the Australian claimed after breaking Seppi for the first time.

Games in the fourth set went to serve before Seppi earned his match point in a tension-filled tiebreaker.

Showing ice-cool nerves, Kyrgios thundered down a 201km/h ace to keep his Open hopes alive.

Kyrgios then unleashed a withering backhand winner down the line on his first set point to force the decider.

Australia's last hope followed up with a vicious down-the-line forehand winner to break Seppi again to seemingly have the veteran on the ropes.

But he inexplicably dropped serve to love in an alarming run of 12 straight points to Seppi, who drew level at 4-4 and then had a break point to give himself the opportunity to serve out the match.

Kyrgios again crunched an ace under untold pressure.

Kyrgios completed his second win from two sets down - after famously staving off nine match points against Richard Gasquet at Wimbledon last year - after three hours and 34 minutes when Seppi wilted and dropped serve to love in the 14th game of the epic final set.

Despite Seppi being ranked only five places above him, Kyrgios's victory ranks as one of the finest of his burgeoning career.

A one-time world No.18, Seppi sent Federer packing from the Open on Friday and also eliminated Lleyton Hewitt last year.

Kyrgios had beaten Italy's now-world No.46 in straight sets in their only previous encounter, at the US Open in September last year.

His victory over Seppi in New York, though, proved to be his last ATP success of 2014, with Kyrgios calling a premature end to his maiden pro season in October, citing fatigue.

Kyrgios's aching back then forced his withdrawal from this month's Hopman Cup before he lost a tight season opener in Sydney to Jerzy Janowicz.

Incredibly, after arriving at Melbourne Park without a tour win in four months, Kyrgios is now three wins away from hoisting the trophy.
