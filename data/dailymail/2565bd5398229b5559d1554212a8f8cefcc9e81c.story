A man has been charged with attempted murder after he allegedly tried to shoot his ex-wife in front of their children at a Gold Coast shopping centre.

Police allege the 43-year-old man waited for his estranged wife armed with a .22 calibre rifle at Westfield Helensvale on Saturday.

He allegedly hit his ex-wife, 35, in the face with the butt of the rifle as she loaded groceries into the back of her car about 10am, before punching her and then firing a shot.
