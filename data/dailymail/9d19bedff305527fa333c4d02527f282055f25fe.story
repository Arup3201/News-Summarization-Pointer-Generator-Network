A married police officer had sex with a 14-year-old girl after texting her saying it would make him 'as bad as a paedophile', a court heard.

Christopher Semak, 33, allegedly exchanged hundreds of messages with the schoolgirl and wrote he could be jailed if their affair was discovered.

Stafford Crown Court heard today that the 
West Midlands Police officer began the relationship in April 2010 and 
had sex with the girl on a number of occasions.

Sex claims: Married police officer Christopher Semak, 33, had sex with a schoolgirl and exchanged hundreds of messages with her, the court heard

Jurors were told the girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, would write in her diary about her liaisons with the policeman.

Opening the case prosecutor
David Jackson said the 
schoolgirl's parents had discovered the messages on her mobile.

He said: 'It was obvious to them (the girl’s 
parents) that, in their minds, sexual activity was taking place between 
the two people exchanging the messages and that sexual activity had 
already taken place.'

The 
court heard when they then asked their daughter about the messages she admitted having a sexual relationship with Semak.

Two days after the messages were found, the victim's parents are said 
to have confronted Semak who told them: 'I have been stupid'.

However, the victim told her parents she did not want police to be contacted. However, she later told a teacher at school and officers were called in.

In a police interview three days later she told officers that the she and Semak had began flirting in March 2010.

She
also claimed Semak said to her 'can you not tell anyone I've been 
texting you because it does look a bit weird, a 30-year-old that's 
texting a 14-year-old'.

Another
follow-up text message read to the court added: 'Of course I want to, 
but if we did things and it got out I'd lose my job, my family and go to
prison because you're only 14.

'I think we should leave it till you're old enough.

'It would make me as bad as the people I am trying to stop.'

Another text added: 'I can't do this with you being so young, it would make me as bad as a paedophile.'

Mr
Jackson told the jury the pair first had sex during the Easter holidays in April when Semak allegedly invited the girl round to watch a DVD 
in his bedroom.

Semak was arrested in January 2012, the court heard, and gave detectives a prepared statement claiming the girl had asked him for advice.

Trial: Semak denies five charges of sexual activity with a child and his case is expected to last two weeks

The teenager had threatened to falsely inform the police that they had had sex, Simek said, prompting him to 'stupidly' respond to her texts.

In his statement to the police, Semak claimed: 'I feared she would make a false allegation if I did not respond in this way.'

Concluding his opening speech to the jury, Mr Jackson said Semak’s case was that his victim had 'invented' her account and then blackmailed him.

All of the charges relate to alleged sexual activity while the officer was off duty.

Semak, from Kings Norton, Birmingham, denies five charges of sexual activity with a child between April 2010 and November 2011

The trial, which is expected to last around two weeks, continues.
