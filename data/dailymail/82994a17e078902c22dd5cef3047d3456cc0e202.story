Reigning Heisman trophy winner Jameis Winston received a criminal citation Tuesday for allegedly shoplifting $32.72 worth of crab legs from a Tallahassee grocery store.

The Florida State quarterback was subsequently suspended from the school's baseball team, on which he plays pitcher when not on the gridiron, must serve 20 hours community service as part of his punishment.

The 20-year-old Alabama native has also released an apology.

'I went to the supermarket with the intent to purchase dinner but made a terrible mistake for which I'm taking full responsibility,' Winston said in a statement Wednesday after news of his misdeed--and punishment--had quickly spread.

Quarterback Jameis Winston #5 of the Florida State Seminoles pictured here after the 2014 Rose Bowl victory over Auburn, is likely not currently celebrating after news broke Wednesday of a criminal citation he received Tuesday for allegedly shoplifting crab legs from a Florida grocery store

'In a 
moment of youthful ignorance, I walked out of the store without paying 
for one of my items,' continued the youngest ever Heisman winner. 'I 
realize that I am in the public spotlight and my conduct needs to be 
above reproach.'

Winston has had 
previous brushes with the law, including a 2013 investigation over an 
alleged rape for which he was never charged.

'Over the last year I've learned that my accomplishments on the fields can be a wonderful thing for my school, teammates, friends, and family,' the athlete's statement said. 'At the same time, I must realize that my mistakes are magnified and can bring great embarrassment to all those who support me every day.'

Winston was not arrested. Unless he fails to show up to community service, his record will remain clean.

'He got an adult civil citation,' a police source told Tomahawk Nation of the arrest alternative usually reserved for juveniles.

'If he completes the sanctions it will never show up on his record,' said the source. 'They are now doing it for minor misdemeanors for adults to lower crime rate.'

The source also revealed the quarterback will be fined $30.

Coaches for both the baseball and football teams officially released statements concerning Winston on Wednesday afternoon.

The incident allegedly occurred at a Publix, a staple in Florida grocery stores

'As a result of his citation last night, we are suspending Jameis Winston from the baseball team,' baseball
 coach Mike Martin said in a statement. 'I am confident he will complete
 his community service obligation and the situation will be resolved 
soon.'

Football
 coach Jimbo Fisher said: 'I fully support Coach Martinâ€™s decision and 
will also make sure that Jameis meets all obligations, which I know he 
will.'

According
 to the SB Nation report, Winston was once investigated by police after a
 Burger King employee accused him of stealing soda using a ketchup cup.

He also faced police questioning for an alleged involvement in a long-running BB gun battle, SB Nation reports.

News of Winston's misdeeds come just weeks after the NCAA changed its rules to allow colleges to feed their athletes as much free food as they want.

There was previously a cap placed at three free meals per day.

The announced rule change came days after Connecticut basketball guard Shabazz Napier's announcement during the Final Four in which he complained of players 'starving.'

Hungry: UConn guard Shabazz Napier complained early in April that he often goes to bed hungry because he can't afford food. Days later, the NCAA announced a lifting of restrictions on free food provided to college athletes

It was unclear if Winston was able to take advantage of the rule at the time of his encounter with authorities.

'He
 was very cooperative,' Leon County Director of Law Enforcement Michael 
Wood said at a news conference Wednesday. 'He seemed fairly honest in 
that he did not pay for the item.'

Winston is the nation's top-rated passer 
and has led the top-ranked Seminoles (13-0) to a spot in the BCS 
championship game against No. 2 Auburn on Jan. 6, his birthday. The 
former five-star recruit from Bessemer, Alabama, made college football 
look easy from his very first game.

On Labor Day night, on national television, Winston went 25 for 27 for 356 yards and four touchdowns in a victory at Pittsburgh.

'I
 can't explain how truly intelligent he is,' Florida State coach Jimbo 
Fisher said. 'He always wanted to know why he had success or why he had 
failure so he could either repeat it or fix it.'

There
 wasn't much failure on the way to becoming the third Seminoles 
quarterback to win the Heisman. The last was Chris Weinke in 2000.

Winston and
 Florida State were cruising toward an undefeated season when news broke
 of an unresolved sexual assault complaint against him made to the 
Tallahassee Police Department last December.

The
 dormant case was handed over to the state attorney's office for a full 
investigation. A female student at Florida State accused Winston of 
rape. Winston's attorney said the sex was consensual.

During
 three weeks of uncertainty, Winston continued to play sensationally, 
while other contenders stumbled or failed to distinguish themselves.

Documents released by the police with the accuser's allegations were not flattering to him.

The
 since-dropped case probably explains why so many voters left him out of
 their top three. Last year, Manziel appeared on 92 percent of the 
ballots. Winston appeared on 87 percent this year.

'Everyone has their own opinion,' Winston said. 'It's basically a numbers game and I was blessed to have the majority vote.'
