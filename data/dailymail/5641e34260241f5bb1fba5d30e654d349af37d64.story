A talented 13-year-old schoolboy has made it into the top 1 per cent of Britain’s brightest people.

Niraj Kumar, of Birmingham, has been welcomed into Mensa after scoring 160 in the high IQ society's test - and told he was on a par with physicist Albert Einstein and businessman Bill Gates.

The average adult IQ score is 100 - with those topping 140 considered to be geniuses - and Niraj, a pupil at King Edward VI School in Edgbaston, is six points above mathematician Carol Vorderman.

He said: ‘I was really happy when I found out I had been accepted. I enjoy school and my favourite lesson is maths. I want to go to Oxford University but I haven't decided what to study yet.’

Niraj, who described his acceptance as a ‘great honour’, will join the glittering ranks of the society, whose star members include director Quentin Tarantino, actress Goldie Hawn and singer Shakira.

His mother Sejal said she had always known her son - who enjoys playing chess - was ‘special’.

The youngster was already showing signs of his genius aged three when he would help his mother Sejal, 36, and 43-year-old father Sandeep, run the Lichfield Road News shop in Aston.

Mrs Kumar said: ‘You couldn't stop him helping. He used to hand over the change to customers and everything. He has always been very bright since he was very young.

‘I always thought he was special but I didn't know just how much. He had two IQ tests and they said it put him on a par with Albert Einstein and Bill Gates.’

Year Nine pupil Niraj has entered various tournaments as a member of the English Chess Federation and even received a certificate of excellence at gold level for his performance.

A Mensa spokesman said: ‘I can confirm Niraj Kumar scored 160 on the Cattell III B IQ test which makes him eligible to join Mensa.’
