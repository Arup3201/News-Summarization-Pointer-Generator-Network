William Spiller, pictured with his partner, Glenys Molyneaux, was allegedly killed by his son Nathan Robinson after a row over money

A man killed his 25-stone father and then 'carefully' dismembered his body and 'neatly packaged' the body parts in plastic storage boxes which he used as a television stand, a court has heard. 

Nathan Robinson used a Stanley knife and hacksaw to cut up the body of his father, 48-year-old William Spiller, at the flat they shared in Bournemouth, Dorset.

The 28-year-old is on trial at Winchester Crown Court accused of the murder of his taxi-driver father, which he denies. 

The jury was shown photographs of the flat, including plastic boxes containing body parts which were stacked with a television placed on top.

They were also shown the  filing cabinet with the box containing Mr Spiller's head inside.

Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Robinson killed his father on May 16 last year, following an argument over money.

He said that a neighbour who lived below the pair noticed a 'pink liquid' was dripping through the ceiling of his bathroom.

The prosecutor said that this was diluted blood as Robinson cleaned up the crime scene with a floor and a steam cleaner which he went out to buy after he killed his father.

Mr Lickley said: 'Mr Spiller was a large man, 6ft 5in, he weighed in excess of 25 stone in weight, hence I say when his body was cut up and dismembered, it would have taken time and effort. Armed with a Stanley knife, small hacksaw and a saw, it would have been a messy business.'

He added that the body parts had been 'packaged neatly' in the boxes.

The prosecutor said that Robinson attempted to cover up the killing and had created a 'things to do' list including paying the rent on the property, which was his first action after the incident.

He also used his father's mobile phone in the following weeks in an attempt to pretend that he was still alive.

After paying the rental company at their offices in cash, he then went to a store and purchased the cleaning equipment.

The neighbour who spotted the dripping blood had previously heard an argument coming from their flat in which the deceased said: 'Do you expect me to keep subsidising you for the rest of my life?'

Mr Spiller's dismembered body was found at the pair's home in Bournemouth after a neighbour saw liquid dripping through his roof

When he went to investigate the liquid, the defendant answered the door and was described as 'very calm, just normal, very collected, there was nothing to say he had just had a fight with his dad'.

Mr Lickley said that Robinson's actions meant that his father's body was not found until a month later, on June 17, after his father's partner, Glenys Molyneux, reported him missing to police because he had stopped replying to text messages.

She believed he had been visiting a friend in the West Midlands.

Mr Lickley said: 'Dorset Police attended the flat, they noted strong smells and flies, alive and dead, in the hallway leading up to the property.

'They entered and they found Mr Spiller within the bedroom area, his body had been dismembered, that is cut up, deliberately and carefully and placed in plastic storage boxes together with items of clothing.

'Mr Spiller's head had been removed, cut off, and was found within another box within a filing cabinet in the bedroom.'

Robinson spent hundreds of pounds drinking and socialising in Glasgow after killing his father, a jury at Winchester Crown Court (pictured) was told

The prosecutor added: 'In one of the boxes was a Stanley knife with a relatively small but sharp blade, a saw and a small hacksaw - the tools, the Crown say, which were used to kill and cut up the body of Mr Spiller.'

Mr Lickley said that Robinson took at least £7,750 in cash belonging to his father and on May 22 went to visit friends in Glasgow where he spent up to £300 'drinking, eating and socialising', all the time sending text messages purporting to come from his dead father.

He then used more money stolen from his father to pay for a weekend with his mother, who was separated from Mr Spiller, to stay at a hotel in Bristol for a vegan weekend.

When he was later arrested at his mother's home in Birmingham, Robinson said to police: 'Is this a joke?'

Robinson denies murder but admits manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility. The trial continues.
