The streets of San Francisco have transformed into Gotham City so that a young cancer victim can achieve his dream of becoming a superhero.

Five-year-old Miles Scott, from Sikiyou County, near Oregon, has assumed the persona of 'Batkid', donning a mini cape in his crusade to rid the city of its fiercest foes, the Penguin and the Riddler.

Thousands of volunteers signed up to help cheer along the boy, who is in remission after a four-year battle with leukemia, as he enjoys his dream day granted by the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

When the charity, which grants wishes for ill children, asked Miles to name his dream, his answer was simply: 'I want to be Batkid!'

It sparked a massive effort by the foundation, friends, strangers and the city of San Francisco to ensure this heroic little boy could achieve his dream.

Finally, on Friday morning, he was called into service by San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr.

Hundreds of people lined the streets and cheered as he emerged from the Batmobile - driven by an adult Batman - before freeing a damsel who had been tied to cable car tracks.

As she embraced him in thanks, he got a call that the Riddler was trying to rob a vault 
downtown, so headed to the Financial District and promptly stopped the thief in his tracks.

News cameras captured the moment the Riddler was hauled from the bank and taken away by police officers.

After battling his enemy, he headed to Burger Bar to refuel, his Make-A-Wish itinerary explained.

While at Burger Bar, he received get a 
call on his batphone to go to the window where he saw a 
huge group of volunteers screaming for Batman’s help - because the Penguin was kidnapping a famous Gotham City mascot - Lou Seal.

Batman and Batkid raced to AT&T 
park to apprehend the villain and freed Lou Seal, the San Francisco 
Giants mascot since 1996.

After catching the Penguin, Batkid made his final stop at City Hall, where the Mayor and the Police 
Chief of Gotham City thanked him and gave him the key to the city.

Uh oh! Batkid then learned that the Riddler had threatened to rob a bank in the Financial District

Batkid was praised for his efforts, with Senator Dianne Feinstein tweeting: 'Thanks for saving Gotham, Batkid!'

Ahead of his heroic efforts, little Miles underwent acrobatic training with his 'Batman', inventor and acrobat 
Eric Johnston, to prepare him for his big day.

Johnston and his wife, Sue Graham 
Johnston, who played the damsel, even created Bat-style 
gadgets such as a wrist device that played previously recorded 
messages from San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr for Batkid throughout
 the day.

Johnston said of Batkid: 'He's
 an excellent superhero because he's a totally mild-mannered kid when 
the mask is off. But when he puts on the armored Batsuit, he's 
uncontainable. He shines.'

Around 1,000 special edition 'Gotham 
City Chronicle' newspapers will be handed out at Union Square today, 
with the headline: 'Batkid saves city.'

And
 even the illustrators for the original Batman are involved, after 
Andrew Farago, curator of the Cartoon Art Museum in San Francisco, 
reached out to cartoonists and DC Comics.

Graham Nolan,
 who drew the Batman series through the 1990s and co-created of the 
villain, Bane, was the first to respond - and sent through a drawing 
showing Miles as Batkid fighting Bane.

Nolan signed it: 'For Miles, a real superhero!'

'We
 certainly all were children who had dreams of being a superhero and 
being larger than life,' Farago told the Mercury News.

'But I think this
 has touched people because most of us have never had to overcome the 
obstacles that this boy has.'

While the day of saving damsels in distress and capturing the Riddler 
will no doubt be great fun for Miles, it is also an important day for 
his family.

'This wish has meant closure for our 
family and an end to over three years of putting toxic drugs in our 
son's body,' said his mother Natalie, the San Jose Mercury News reported.

The Make-A-Wish Foundation grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to give them hope.

Other
 incredible wishes it has granted include Justin Bieber meeting 
eight-year-old Annalysha Brown-Rafanan, who suffers from a 
life-threatening liver condition, and 11-year-old Tyler Sue, who has a serious genetic condition, meeting her 'Cake Boss' idol, Buddy Valastro.
