The 12th National Games, an event known as China's 'mini-Olympics', opened today with an incredible series of mass choreographed aerobic displays involving thousands of performers.

Chinese President Xi Jinping opened the games, which run until September 12, at the Olympic Sports Centre in Shenyang, the capital city of Liaoning Province in the nation's north-east yesterday.

The country's new leadership is on a cost-cutting drive and slashed the budget for the games by 78 per cent to a £58m, a tenth of which was spent on the opening ceremony. It was even held in daylight to slash the cost of lighting.

As part of this, costly celebrity performers were replaced by amateur performers. A group of senior mothers performed a 'fitness' dance', often seen in public spaces throughout China.

The games, held every four years, showcases all the 28 Olympic sports, as well as baseball, softball and Wushu (a Chinese martial art) and attracted 9,770 athletes, including Olympic swimming champions and world record holders Sun Yang and Ye Shiwen.

A total of 38 delegations from the provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, the People's Liberation Army, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and the various sports associations of the railway, coal mining, forestry, finance, banking and aviation industries take part.

As well as acting as a testing ground for future Olympic champions, the games also allows authorities to scrutinise the work done by the provincial sports authorities.

The first National Games were held in Beijing in 1959. The forerunner of the games was the Chinese National Games, first held in 1910 during the Qing Dynasty.

This ran until 1948 and the competition was relaunched under its current name in 1959, following the formation of the People's Republic of China.
