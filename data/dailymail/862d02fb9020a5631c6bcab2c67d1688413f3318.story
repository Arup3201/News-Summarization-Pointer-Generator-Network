He's the muscled model who set hearts aflutter all over the world when he appeared in a Dolce & Gabbana ad in nothing more than a pair of tight, white pants.

Now David Gandy is set to recreate his famous pose in a pair of M&S pants, after the high street favourite signed up the 34-year-old in a bid to see off competition from H&M's David Beckham.

What's more, the Essex model won't just be wearing the pants - like Beckham, Gandy will be turning his hand to designing them as well.

Kecks appeal: David Gandy set female hearts aflutter when he appeared in tight pants for Dolce & Gabbana

He joins a select group of models turned pant designers, which also includes Portugal midfielder, Cristano Ronaldo, who designs and stars in the campaigns for his CR7 range.

The men's pant market is worth an impressive £700m in the UK alone, and competition is becoming increasingly fierce.

According to M&S, their new signing is an inspiration for men while being irresistible to women - a combination that they hope will result in soaring pant sales.

'We feel it's a more authentic collaboration,' revealed Scott Fyfe, menswear director at M&S. 'Women adore him and men love his style credentials.'

Gandy himself described his new role as 'a step on' from his modelling work and says he was involved in every part of the design process, including the choice of fabrics.

The new pants, which launch in September, will be sold in twin packs for £20 - more expensive than the chain's current offering, although that's unlikely to put off famous fans such as David Cameron.

What's more, according to analysts Verdict, the new range is likely to strike a chord, with men prepared to splash out more as the economy recovers.

Speaking to the Sunday Times, retail analyst Kate Ormerod said: 'Disposable incomes are rising and people want to trade back up.' Good news, then, for M&S and Gandy.
