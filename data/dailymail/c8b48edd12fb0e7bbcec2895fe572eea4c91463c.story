Mario Balotelli thanked the Liverpool fans who helped him avoid a red card against Manchester United, writing 'I wasn’t alone on the pitch'.

During the closing stages of Manchester United's win over Liverpool, Balotelli had to be restrained by the fans after clashing with Chris Smalling after taking offence to a tackle.

The fiery Italian reacted to being forced into the advertising boards and was quick in his attempts to grab the England international.

Liverpool fans intervened and may have played their part in keeping Balotelli on the pitch - with the forward being booked just a few minutes before. 

And Balotelli showed his appreciation for the supporters on Monday, posting a picture to Facebook thanking them for helping him.

'Besides all efforts the game didn’t go our way,' he wrote. 'But one thing was real clear: I wasn’t alone on the pitch. YNWA' 

The incident occured after the Balotelli took a poor touch and Smalling attempted to shepherd him off the pitch but both players collided with the boards during the physical tussle.

The England international was quick to get on with the game but the Italian attempted to grab him and a stand-off ensued.

Neither player were booked for the clash and Brendan Rodgers may be thankful the Liverpool supporters were able to restrain the fiery 24-year-old. 

The duo competed for the ball and momentum appeared to take them into the boards
