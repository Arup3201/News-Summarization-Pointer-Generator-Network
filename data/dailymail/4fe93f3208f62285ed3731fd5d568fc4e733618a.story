Sunderland are weighing up a bid to hijack Newcastle's move for French striker Bafetimbi Gomis.

Newcastle have been regarded favourites to land Gomis, who is a free agent, after holding a long-term interest in the former Lyon striker.

However, just 24 hours after losing Jack Colback to their neighbours, Sunderland are ready to join the chase for Gomis as Gus Poyet looks to bring in a new striker to the Stadium of Light.

Galatasaray also want the 27-year-old France international.

The Black Cats have been quick to act in the transfer market so far this summer, with Poyet obviously keen to reshape his playing squad.

Billy Jones has signed on a free transfer from West Brom, Jordi Gomez has arrived from Wigan and Sebastian Larsson has signed a new three-year contract.

Meanwhile, they have been linked with a move for Swansea and Wales captain Ashley Williams.
