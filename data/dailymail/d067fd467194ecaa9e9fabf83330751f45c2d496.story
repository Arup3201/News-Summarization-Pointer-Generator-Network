A mystery customer has lifted the spirits of three Arizona-based restaurant workers after spending $420 on drinks and snacks - then leaving a staggering $11,000 worth of 'Tips for Jesus'.

The unidentified man arrived at Crudo restaurant in Phoenix at 10pm on December 27 and shared a post-dinner snack and a round of drinks with a woman, according to one of the venue's partners.

He then closed the tab, leaving a $1,000 tip on a $331.40 bill, before they both stayed for further drinks. When they later paid off the second $89.89 tab, the man added a huge $10,000 tip.

A welcome surprise: A mystery customer has lifted the spirits of three Arizona-based restaurant workers after leaving around $11,000 worth of 'Tips for Jesus' two days after Christmas. Above, the tipper's receipts

Amazed: Bartender Clint Spotleson, one of the three servers who received the tips at Crudo restaurant in Phoenix, posted a photo of the bills to Instagram, saying: '@tipsforjesus hit @crudoaz again!!! Unbelievable!'

Bartender Clint Spotleson, one of the three Crudo servers who received the tips, posted a photo of the bills to Instagram, writing: '@tipsforjesus hit @crudoaz again!!!!! Unbelievable!!!'

On both of the receipts, the words, 'Tips for Jesus', were scrawled in pen by the customer.

In this case, 'Tips for Jesus' is believed to refer to the anonymous person - or people - who regularly leave extravagant tips at restaurants and document their recipients' joy on an Instagram page.

The page, which has more than 84,000 followers, features the slogan: 'Doing the Lord's work, one tip at a time.' It typically features restaurants in New York and Los Angeles, as well as Phoenix.

Speaking to AOL, Mr Spotleson said he, another bartender and a cocktail waitress shared the $11,000 combined tip, but also chose to give some of it to Crudo's kitchen staff.

Describing his reaction to the customer's estimated 2,500-per-cent tip, he added: 'I dropped everything I had and just froze for second.... I had a bottle in my hand when he said it.

'It was a quick slip, but I caught it. The owner kind of gave me this look like, "Oh, my gosh, wow!".'

Maureen Campbell, one of Crudo's partners, told ABC News that although the tipper wished to remain anonymous, he did stick around long enough to allow the restaurant workers to thank him.

'That's amazing!': Members of the public responded positively to the anonymous customer's generous tip

'He did hand them the check before he left and they were very grateful for such a generous amount of money they received,' she said. 'I don’t know what his response was.'

She added that the woman who had accompanied the man was believed by staff to be his date.

The customer, who was using an American Express card, apparently left a tip at the same restaurant last year. However, it was for a lower - still, generous - amount of $2,500.

Describing the tipper, Mr Spotleson said: 'He's a man ... He's in an age group where he's not old and rackety, but he's definitely got the ability to spend that kind of money.'
