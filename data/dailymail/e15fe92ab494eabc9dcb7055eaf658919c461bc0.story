Gary Anderson took the top gong at the PDC Annual Awards Dinner on Thursday by winning the player of year award.

Anderson, who won three other awards, James Wade, Stephen Bunting and Keegan Brown all collected trophies on a glittering night at The Dorchester in London.

Scottish ace Anderson's brilliant return to his best over the past 12 months was crowned earlier this month when he edged out Phil Taylor 7-6 to win the William Hill World Darts Championship title.

PDC Player of the Year

Winner: Gary Anderson 

He had also won seven PDC ProTour titles during 2014 before claiming glory in the Cash Converters Players Championship Finals in Minehead at the end of November, and was a semi-finalist in the Betway Premier League, BetVictor World Matchplay and partypoker.com World Grand Prix.

Anderson's success was rewarded as he dominated the PDC's Annual Awards Dinner on Thursday night at London's famous Dorchester Hotel, including winning the prestigious Player of the Year title.

He opened the evening by picking up the ProTour Player of the Year title, with his seven wins and £113,250 prize money edging out Michael van Gerwen to top the 2014 standings based on performances in European Tour events, Players Championships and UK Open Qualifiers.

Anderson was then voted as the PDPA Players' Player of the Year and the PDC Fans' Player of the Year - scooping over 60 per cent of the vote in each poll - before being named as the PDC Player of the Year.

His achievement matches the four awards which Phil Taylor won at the 2009 and 2010 PDC Annual Awards Dinner - ironically as he won the same four trophies in back-to-back years - as he enjoyed further success.

James Wade's incredible comeback from 9-2 down to win the final of November's Unibet Masters 11-10 against Mervyn King was voted as the PDC Televised Performance of the Year for a victory which earned the left-hander his eight career major title.

Stephen Bunting was named as the PDC Best Newcomer, with the former Lakeside Champion having won a UK Open Qualifier, reached the World Grand Prix semi-finals and moved up to 24th in the PDC Order of Merit since joining the PDC circuit 12 months ago.

PDC Unicorn World Youth Champion Keegan Brown, who made a big impression at the SINGHA Beer Grand Slam of Darts and World Championship, was named as the PDC Young Player of the Year.

The night also saw players who landed a nine-dart finish on the PDC circuit during the year inducted into the PDC Nine-Dart Club and presented with a commemorative pin badge. The six players who landed a televised nine-darter - Phil Taylor, James Wade, Robert Thornton, Michael van Gerwen, Kim Huybrechts and Adrian Lewis - were presented with a gold pin badge.

The 11 players who achieved a perfect leg away from the television cameras in 2014 received a silver pin badge to recognise their achievement. They included Taylor, Lewis and Chisnall - who each landed two nine-darters on the PDC ProTour in 2014 - as well as Terry Jenkins, Dave Ladley, David Pallett, Michael van Gerwen, Johnny Haines, Matthew Dicken, Darryl Fitton and Gary Stone.
