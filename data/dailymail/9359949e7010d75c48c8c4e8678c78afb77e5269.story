Never mind a silver spoon - meet the pampered pooch that was born with a diamond fork in her mouth.

Betty lives the high life on the family farm in Essex with her owner Hayley Dexter, who has showered the three-year-old pup with lavish gifts.

Hayley and her family have splashed out a whopping £30,000 on Betty since they got her as a tiny puppy just three years ago.

Betty  could be the most pampered pooch in Britain. The Maltese dog lives in Essex with her owner Hayley Dexter. She has her own bedroom, a diamond collar and a crystal fork 

The young Maltese is the envy of the other dogs on the block as she boasts her own bedroom, custom-made four poster bed and a wardrobe filled with dog outfits. 

She is also fed by hand from her very own Swarovski fork and is never seen without her signature bling - either a diamond collar or a customised pearl necklace.

Hayley, 37, who runs five star dog hotel Essex Pooch Palace, said: 'Betty definitely has us all wrapped around her little paws.

'She is very spoilt, a real princess - she has her own bedroom at the palace, and we bought her some custom-made furniture.

'My daughter even took her to her prom in a matching dress that we had designed and made especially for her.

'The whole family are absolutely dog crazy and if we are out and about and see something for her, then we just buy it.

'Betty is a huge part of our family and it's all just harmless fun. 

'All I care about is that she is a happy dog, and you can see when she is with me that she is very happy.

'She has nice things and nice clothes but maybe because we have spoiled her, she expects more.'

Hayley, who also has rescue dog Angel, runs luxury dog kennels Essex Pooch Palace which she set up with her cousin, Tracey Rust, three-years-ago.

Betty's spoilt behaviour inspired her owner Hayley to start a five-star luxury kennels business 

The business was inspired by Tracey's dog Pedro, who passed away last year, as she hated leaving him in kennels - with spoiled pups like Betty in mind as ideal clients.

Mum-of-three Hayley said: 'The Pooch Palace is a luxury five-star hotel and spa for dogs.

'We offer grooming, spa services, boarding kennels, dog walking and paw-dicures for dogs of all shapes and sizes.

'Betty was the inspiration behind it because of how spoilt she is and how much she loves to be pampered.

'All of our customers absolutely adore her - she gets just as many gifts from them as she does from us. 

'Her diamond collar was actually a gift from a client.

'She is a very lucky dog indeed.'
