An eight-year-old Brazilian boy showed he intends to live life in the fast lane after deciding to head out on one of the busiest motorways in Rio de Janeiro... on his tricycle.

The unnamed youngster was filmed careering down the Elevado Paulo de Frontin expressway which runs through downtown Rio, on his three-wheeler..

As the boy speeds down the slope of the two-lane carriageway into Avenida Presidente Vargas with his legs splayed out either side of the trike cars zoom past him on the outside lane.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO:

Dicing with death: Fearless boy punches the air as he rides alongside cars

Freewheeling: The boy, said to be from a local slum, kicked his legs out and sped down the hill of the busy motorway

In the incredible clip, filmed on Friday, the youngster starts off at the top of a slope and gathers speed by pushing off with his left leg then jumping on the tricycle.

The stunt looks like it could go disastrously wrong for a moment when the toy-rider wobbles precariously around for a few seconds as he tries to gain control.

Luckily, the road is unusually quiet as he gains composure and the fearless boy even takes the time to remove his right shoe before it falls off.

As he veers precariously into the middle of the road, several cars come around the bend. 

Risky: The Elevado Paulo de Frontin expressway is one of the busiest roads in Rio

Toy rider: The boy seems completely unfazed as he sets off on his death defying ride

Totally unfazed, the boy looks around at the stunned driver he is sharing the road with.

He even pretends to change gears by twisting the handlebars and hunches over as if revving his make-believe engine.

Despite being one bump in the road away from certain peril, the fearless junior even has the audacity to give the alarmed motorists a thumbs up before grabbing the handlebars again.

Hard shoulder: At one point the boy is almost forced onto the central wall of the busy highway

Pit stop: The junior joy rider stops close to the edge of the lane before rejoining the road for a second time

During his dangerous venture onto the carriageway, no driver stops to help the boy who is on a notoriously busy stretch of road.

The bypass is also riddled with security cameras operated by Rio city council, but they were oblivious to the incident until a local TV station showed them the footage. 

As the boy reaches this the end of his ride he lifts his arms in celebration as if having triumphed in a grand prix, but his moment of glory is abruptly brought to an end by a motorist who blasts their horn at the pint sized daredevil.

Rider in red: The boy is said to be known to authorities in Rio as a local trouble causer

Final lap: He eventually calls it a day after being narrowly missed by a number of speeding cars

Not satisfied with the one lap, to the astonishment of surrounding drivers, the youngster then drags his bike from the hard shoulder and gets back into the inside lane for another go.

This time he hugs the side of the road and that may have saved his life as a grey car speeds round the bend, just yards behind the boy.

Fortunately, the driver spots the tricycle up ahead and swerves into the outside lane to avoid a collision.

No fear: The boy insisted he was not scared when reporters caught up with him after his stunt

A local TV reporter who filmed the escapade gave the boy a post race interview when they found him a few minutes later sitting on his trusty tricycle.

'Weren’t you scared?' asks the reporter. 'No' says the child with a complete air of innocence.

Although they were not shown in the video, the boy was accompanied by two older brothers who had also participated in the dangerous motorway game. 

A reporter tracked down the family of five to a nearby run down property. The mother, father and three children were said by neighbours to be living in a one bedroom space.

The premises which has home walls inside, dividing the area up into separate dwellings, houses a total of twenty families.

It’s situated close to the motorway and opposite the Rio City hall building in the centre.  Each family pays 300 reais, around £83.00, in rent per month. 

On Friday afternoon, journalists found the mother but she declined to comment.

By yesterday, the family had disappeared as the authorities, who had been alerted to the incident, turned up to take the children into care.

Rio city council revealed the brood was already known to social services and the children had been taken into care before following previous concerns raised about their welfare. 

The city's municipal guards, who are responsible for road safety, issued a statement this week apologising for their failure to respond appropriately to the incident on Friday.

They said: 'Nobody reported the incident to us, so we were unaware of what was happening. If we had known we would have closed the road down immediately to ensure the safety of the public and the child'.
