A 65-year-old man has told how he was dragged off a toilet by a black bear while on a camping trip in Canada.

Gord Shurvell, from Winnipeg, was on a camping and fishing trip with a friend near Ontario on Saturday when he went to visit the outhouse.

Mr Shurvell said he had left the door open to enjoy the view when the bear came in.

Started screaming: Mr Shurvell (left) was in the outhouse when the bear grabbed hold of his shoulder and started dragging him outside towards the bush. She suffered claw and bite marks on his body (right)

'I'm sitting on the throne and my feet are sort of up on the 'poopstool,' we call it,' he said.

'So I'm kicking at him to get away, but he grabbed my pants that were down around my ankles. And that was the start of it, and he just kept coming.'

The bear grabbed hold of him by the shoulder and began dragging him outside towards the bush.

'Iâ€™m screaming for my buddy to come with a gun,' he said.

Daniel Alexander, Mr Shurvell's camping partner, came running with a gun.

'I could see Gord's head,' said Alexander, who decided against taking a shot at the bear because of the risk to his friend.

'So just as I moved over, the bear dropped Gordie and turned around and looked at me, and that was the best thing that ever happened.'

Alexander pulled the trigger and the bear was dead.

Mr Shurvell is now recovering after being treated in hospital for scratches to the head, neck and arms as well as a puncture wound to the head.

He needed 12 stitches in his head, and he has claw marks on his back and bites on his shoulder.

But he survived, thanks to Alexander.

'Now I owe him,' said Shurvell of his pal. 'But I'm gonna call him 'Sure-Shot.' That's his nickname.'
