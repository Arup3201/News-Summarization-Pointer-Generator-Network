Cambridge United boss Richard Money was left pinching himself after his side drew Manchester United in the fourth round of the FA Cup.

Money described the clash, which will take place at Abbey Stadium later this month, as a 'dream'.

The match-up with the Red Devils is Cambridge's reward for their 2-1 victory over Luton Town on Saturday and Money was almost speechless after the draw.

'It's a game you can only dream of and there were just so many emotions going through my mind when the draw was made,' Money said in quotes reported by the Telegraph.

The 59-year-old admitted the cash windfall Cambridge could stand to receive will make a massive difference to the club.

'I'm not counting my chickens just yet but I'd expect the game to be selected for live television so it will obviously be a huge boost financially,' he added.

'Our finances are stable anyway but this tie will enable us to make improvements on and off the field far quicker than we could have done.'

There are 79 league places separating Cambridge, who are the lowest ranked side left in the competition, and Louis van Gaal's high-flying Old Trafford outfit.

Cambridge winger Harrison Dunk, also tweeted: 'Man Utd at home in the FA Cup buzzzzing!!'

Amid the excitement Money is keen to keep his players' feet on the ground and make sure their form in League Two does not suffer in the meantime.

But even he is looking forward to welcoming opposite number Van Gaal, who is aiming to win United's first FA Cup for 11 years, to East Anglia.

He added: 'We've got two league games until we play United and I'll make sure we keep everyone's feet on the ground. I'll have to get a nice bottle of wine ready for Louis van Gaal, I'll probably have to have a word with the chairman!'
