Victim: Natalie Egleston, 48, was pronounced dead from a traumatic brain injury after another female skier collided with her on Aspen Mountain

A woman enjoying a ski vacation at the upscale Aspen resort was killed Monday when another skier collided with her on the mountain.

Pitkin County coroner's officials said Tuesday that 48-year-old Natalie Egleston, of Ardmore, Pennsylvania, died at a hospital of a traumatic brain injury.

According to Aspen Skiing Co. officials, Egleston was unconscious after the collision with another female skier.

Resort officials said the other skier, a woman from New York City, sustained minor injuries. Both skiers were wearing helmets.

In a phone interview with MailOnline Thursday, Ski Patrol Director
Jeff Lumsden identified the other skier as Virginia Chen.

Sheriff Joe DiSalvo told The Aspen Times it appeared Egleston may have stopped to clean her goggles when the other woman slammed into her.

Resort officials say the tragic accident happened at around 3:45pm on Spar Gulch, just below where an expert run called Jackpot exits.

Egleston was wearing dark or gray clothes and may have been standing in a shadow at the time, Pitkin County Sheriff DiSalvo told Aspen Daily News. She was skiing that day with her boyfriend, identified by MailOnline Thursday as Ron Konsza, of Pennsylvania. 

By the time Ski Patrol got the call about and accident and arrived on the scene, the 48-year-old woman was unresponsive. She was taken to Aspen Valley Hospital and pronounced dead from a traumatic brain injury.

County deputy coroner Eric Hansen said Egleston’s fatal injury resulted from her head hitting the snow. She also suffered cracked ribs from the impact.

According to Jeff Lumsden, Egleston's 'brain stem snapped' as a result of the crash.

Sheriff's officials are still trying to determine how fast the other skier was going down the run at the time of the crash, but a preliminary investigation has shown that her speed did not appear to be excessive, suggesting that there was no criminal negligence on her part.

According to the Colorado Skier Safety Act, the person higher up on the hill has the responsibility to avoid people below.

Aspen Ski Patrol said the woman obeyed the Skier Safety Act by staying at the scene of the collision and immediately coming to Egleston's aid.

Chen could face a citation, which comes with a $1,000 fine, but officials said the skier could also be subject to a major civil lawsuit, CBS Denver reported.

Egleston, a graduate of the 
prestigious Cornell University, served as president of IndoorDirect, a 
marketing company that produces entertainment for restaurants.

She
had previously worked as chief strategy officer and executive vice 
president at Premier Retail Networks (PRN), a San-Francisco based 
company specializing in digital out-of-home advertising.

According to an industry blog DailyDOOH, Egleston had 24 years of experience in the field of marketing and was only recently named president of IndoorDirect.

Egleston's former colleagues at PRN told the blog: 'Natalie was one of the really good ones.'

Several commenters who worked with Egleston eulogized her online Thursday.

'It is so sad to learn of Natalie’s death,' wrote Mike DiFranza. 'Our industry has lost one of it’s most passionate proponents.'

David Goldstein, who had worked with Egleston at PRN, said in a post: 'Her insights on the industry and the passion to achieve success, along with her openess [sic] to new ideas, made her a great leader. Here laughter, compassion and smile, made her a great friend.'

Her brother, Brian, told the blog Denver Westword she recently returned to the Philadelphia area after living in San Francisco.

In an email message to MailOnline, Egleston’s friend Elizabeth Winchcombe pointed out that the 48-year-old woman was ‘an expert skier, and knew the Aspen resort extremely well.’

Reporting by MailOnline has revealed Thursday that Egleston had been in a relationship with a man by the name Ron Konsza.

It is believed that Egleston was on the slopes with Konsza when the crash happened.

Konsza, 55, works as an aeronautical engineer at Lockheed Martin based in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. According to his Facebook page, the two met in 2010.

According to online records, in his free time, Konsza is involved in competitive ski racing. He has been part of the Nature Valley NASTAR, the largest public ski race program in the world with more than 95,000 members, according to its website.

Konsza has been competing since 1997 and was awarded a gold medal and the top ranking after racing to victory in Pennsylvania's Bear Creek resort in January.

About a week before the tragedy in Aspen, Konsza raced to two platinum and silver medals in two races at Roundtop Mountain Resort in Pennsylvania.

Egleston’s death marks the third fatality on the local ski runs so far this winter. Four days earlier, champion X Games snowmobiler Caleb Moore passed away from a fatal injury which he suffered when his machine flipped over on top of him.
