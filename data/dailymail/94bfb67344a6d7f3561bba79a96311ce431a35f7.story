A combative Barack Obama took aim Thursday night at Congressional Republicans for embracing social-issues talk about economic inequality as they flex their new majority muscles and look ahead to the 2016 presidential election.

The president jabbed at the GOP, who he said have curiously begun emphasizing the needs of America's middle class and those in poverty.

'Even though their policies haven't quite caught up, their rhetoric is starting to sound pretty Democratic,' he said. 'I consider imitation the highest form of flattery.'

Obama also filleted Mitt Romney, his 2012 election opponent, for focusing on the economics of ordinary Americans just three years after he was castigated for alienating the country's '47 per cent' who rely on government benefits to make ends meet.

'We've got a former presidential candidate on the other side who suddenly is just deeply concerned about poverty,' Obama said, drawing jeers from lawmakers. 'That's great. Let's go. Come on. Let's do something about it.'

President Barack Obama addressed the House Democratic Caucus retreat on January 29, 2015 in Philadelphia

Romney, an early front-runner in the Republican presidential sweepstakes after losing to Obama in 2012, made a campaign-style Wednesday night at Mississippi State University and focused on how the GOP should attack poverty. 

'The rich have done historically well,' he said. 'I'm concerned about the middle class and the poor in this country.'

Romney said Washington must 'lift people out of poverty' while it 'restore(s) opportunity, particularly for the middle class. He blamed the growing gap between rich and poor on 'liberal policies' emanating from Obama's Oval Office.

And he fired back at the presdient with a tweet a few hours after Obama called him out for his newest messaging.

'Mr. Obama, wonder why my concern about poverty?' he wrote in Twitter's compressed 140 character format. 'The record number of poor in your term, and your record of failure to remedy.'

In a sign of the partisan rancor that can bleed over into social media, the spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid snarked about Romney calling him 'Mr. Obama.'

'It's President Obama,' Adam Jentleson tweeted. 

Most of Obama's 20-minute speech Thursday night rehashed themes from his January 20 State of the Union address, but in one respect he put meat on what had been bare-bones messaging.

Reporters were ushered out of the room at the Sheraton Philadelphia Society Hill Hotel before a Q-and-A session began.

But he is proposing to add $74 billion in new spending, about a 7 per cent increase, to the government's 2016 budget, splitting the additions between defense and domestic priorities

Obama himself proposed a mechanism known as a budget 'sequester' in 2011: Because Republicans and Democrats failed to agree on an annual budget for 2013, the previous year's budget was 'continued' – but with fixed percentages of the funds locked up and made unavailable.

When Republicans called his bluff despite a harrowing impact on the Pentagon, the president sought to shift the blame back to them.

But Watergate-era journalist Bob Woodward documented the source of the idea in his book, 'The Price of Politics,' showing that the White House pressed the 'sequester' plan on its own.

On Thursday the president irged House Democrats to ignore that sequester entirely, complaining about 'manufactured crises and mindless austerity' in Washington.

Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney fired back Thursday night, only to hear the press spokesman for Sen. Harry Reid pounce over calling the president 'Mr. Obama' in the 140-character Twitter format

REPEAT: Obama gave a State of the Union address on January 20 that contained all the major themes Obama discussed with Democratas on Thursday, essentially subjecting them to a repeat performance

He insisted he would find the money to pay for it by pressing for new taxes that will hit America's top income earners.

That plan will undoubtedly hit roadblocks in the form of a Republican Party that now controls both houses of Congress and seems eager to stare Obama down. 

The president's new budget for 2016 will hit desks Monday morning on Capitol Hill. The GOP is expected to declare it 'dead on arrival' by Monday afternoon.

'I don't think there's going to be a lot of support for going back on the commitments we made to reduce spending,' South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune told the Agence France-Presse newswire on Thursday.

'It's going to be very hard to feature a scenario where Republicans on Capitol Hill are going to go along with some of the president's recommendations to increase spending.' 

'Republicans are concerned about the impact of the sequester on the military budget,' he acknowledged.

A divided government presents new problems for Obama – has last two years will be his first without Democrats in control of at least half of Congress – and he accepted some of the blame on Thursday for a mid-term election that turned into his party's worst nightmare.

'Obviously we were all disappointed with the outcome of the last election, and there are a lot of reasons for it,' the president said. 'And I'm happy to take on some of the blame.'
