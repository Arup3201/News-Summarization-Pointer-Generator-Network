A dog has been forced to undergo extensive reconstruction surgery and have its tail removed after suffering from horrific burns in a house fire.

Five-year-old Pomeranian mix Papi was critically injured after his owner Jackelyn Graciano was stabbed and then had her house set ablaze in Lawrence, Massachusetts.

Ms Graciano is still in hospital recovering from stab wounds, while her pet has been treated after being rushed to Angell Animal Medical Center in Boston in a critical condition after the fire.

Papi has already underwent major surgery to remove dead tissue from his back and ears and needs another procedure to repair his ankle

He was admitted to the emergency and critical care unit, where doctors first administered pain relief and oxygen.

But the extent of his injuries soon became clear after suffering second and third degree burns all along his back, his nose and the inside of his mouth.

Earlier this month Papi underwent major surgery to remove dead tissue from his back and ears as well as have his tail removed, which was so badly damaged, it could not be saved.

Dr Mike Pavletic who performed the operation said: 'The challenge with Papi is that most of his body is covered in second and third degree burns. He's lost a lot of tissue.

It is likely that Papi's care will cost as much as $10,000 but an anonymous donor has already contributed $6,000 towards it

'The goal of surgery was to use whatever healthy skin he has left to close the gaps.Â  I'm confident it's gone as well as possible but he'll need at least one more procedure.'

His next operation will take place in the coming weeks, where doctors will attempt to repair a damaged ankle, which left untreated could make it difficult and painful for him to walk.

The cost of Papi's care is likely to exceed $10,000 but an anonymous donor has already stepped forward with a gift of $6,000 to help offset the cost of the treatment.

Now Ms Graciano is desperate for herself and Papi to recover quickly so they can be together again.

She said: 'It is an extremely difficult time for me and my family and I cannot imagine life without Papi.'

According to the Lawrence Police Department, Ms Graciano was allegedly stabbed by Yohanna Estrella, who then set fire to the residence.

Estrella is now facing charges spanning arson, assault and battery on a household member and battery with a dangerous weapon with the intent to murder.
