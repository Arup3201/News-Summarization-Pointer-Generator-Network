He was filmed following a court hearing in which some of his former lovers - and mothers to his children - were demanding that he pay tens of thousands of dollars in back child support, Inquisitr.com reports.

Magistrate Scott Rosenberg said that the 33-year-old dad would have to work three of four full-time jobs to come up with the unpaid child support he owes.

However, Shaw said that his criminal record makes it difficult for him to land a stable, well-paying job.

‘I play the hell out of the Tennessee lottery,’ he boasted. ‘I don’t block my blessings.'

Shaw described himself as a good father, but said that he is currently unable to pay child support.

However, NewsChannel 5 has reported that Shaw has been receiving calls from Hollywood agents, and has recently signed a production deal for a reality show. He said any money he makes on the show will be spent on his children.

It has also been revealed that the 33 -year-old is soon to become a grandfather, after his 16-year-old daughter announced she is pregnant.

However it seems he is not altogether pleased at the prospect.

He said: 'I have babies for her. If she wanted a baby, daddy has plenty for us.'
