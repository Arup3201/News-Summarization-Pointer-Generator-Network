A man survived after being struck by lightning during a storm thanks to his rubber-soled slippers, which stopped the electricity passing through his body.

Greg Slater was hit by a lightning bolt after he went outside with an umbrella to check a leaky gutter at his home near St Austell, Cornwall.

However, he escaped unhurt and did not even know anything had happened until his wife told him she had seen him showered in electrical sparks.

The 43-year-old father of two could have been seriously injured or even died if he had not been wearing rubber soles.

Lucky escape: Greg Slater was saved by his slippers after he went outside in a storm carrying an umbrella

Danger: The father of two was checking a leaky gutter during a thunderstorm at the time of the incident

His lucky escape came during a storm over the hamlet of Higher Porthpean last week, when 'ball lightning' apparently struck him.

Other villagers reported seeing the flash of light, which destroyed circuit boards and caused an explosion so loud it could be heard in the next village.

One local even witnessed a lightning bolt jump across his kitchen after entering his house via the Aga.

'I thought I'd nip out and see where our gutters have been leaking, so I ran outside with a big umbrella and was leaning back looking up towards the gutter when a hole literally opened in the sky above me,' said Mr Slater, a development manager for Cornwall Council.

Destruction: A telephone socket was burned out when Mr Salter's house was hit by ball lightning

Home: Neighbours of Mr Slater in Higher Porthpean, Cornwall saw the lightning flash too

'It had been a totally grey clouded sky and this small area momentarily opened up and then there was the most almighty bang and flash of light.

'I was rooted to the spot for a few seconds before going into the house. I thought the cottage had been struck by lightning, but it was only when I saw my wife who was in total shock that I realised I had been hit by lightning.

'My wife had been looking out of the window and had seen me just showered from head to toe in white. She said the lightning had gone down my umbrella to the ground.

'To have been completely unharmed by it is really a chance in a million. I was thanking my lucky stars - and slippers.'

Mr Slater thinks he was hit by ball lightning, a mysterious phenomenon which occurs during thunderstorms as a ball of electricity reaches the ground and explodes, leaving a sulphurous stink.

Grateful: The council worker could have been seriously hurt without the help of his slippers

'I saw this ball of light then there was the most almighty bang,' he said. 'The village just had this incredible smell of sulphur.

'Afterwards I noticed that my neck and shoulders were very stiff and sections of my legs and arms were in spasms and felt really tight.

'They also went cold and tingled and I felt pretty hyperactive afterwards. I felt like I was literally buzzing.'

He added: 'My father, who was a physics teacher, thinks the fact that the umbrella and I were wet allowed the charge to pass down the outside of me. All I can say is thank the Lord I had rubber-soled slippers on.

'People need to realise that they need to take these ever more frequent extreme weather events seriously, and to believe the old wives' tale about lightning and umbrellas.'
