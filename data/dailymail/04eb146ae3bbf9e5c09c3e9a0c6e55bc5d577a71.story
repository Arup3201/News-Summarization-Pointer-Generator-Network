This is the incredible moment a pair of bloodied tigers slashed each other with their claws in a dramatic fight over territory.

The dramatic battle was caught on camera at the world famous 'Tiger Canyons' in the Londolozi private game reserve in Pretoria, South Africa.

The clash erupted after one of the tigers delivered a vicious blow to the neck of its rival.

Believing it to be dead, the tiger released its opponent from its jaws but instead of the fight coming to a grizzly end, the two broke out in a second, even more savage struggle.

German photographer, Marion Vollborn, captured the predatory pair while on safari tour.

Ms Vollborn said 'The day before I took these pictures, our group spotted two male tigers pacing along each of their own territory borders.

'There had been a female tiger who had mated with both males and there was a very tense atmosphere but nothing had yet happened.

'In the morning we all suddenly heard a loud roar and we drove immediately towards the noise.

'The male tigers we had been observing the day before were in the water hidden by reeds, one had bitten the other on the throat and they both remained still for several minutes.

'It was horrific to see, the tigers were covered in mud, blood and water we could see them both breathing heavily because of the cold air.

'One of the tigers assumed his rival to be dead and it stopped biting but the bitten tiger saw his chance to escape and save his own life.

'All of a sudden a spectacular fight for life and death began, again and again the males clawed at each other.

Raw power: While both fighters were up to the task, after 45 minutes of fighting a winner emerged - and it was the significantly stronger and younger male

Injured: 'The roaring was unbelievably loud, everyone who was there watching was clearly scared and I will never forget those sounds,' Vollborn said

'The roaring was unbelievably loud, everyone who was there watching was clearly scared and I will never forget those sounds.

'The two opponents went from the reeds to the shrubbery and finally to an open area, both were bleeding heavily and we all feared the worst.

'After 45 minutes of fighting a winner emerged, it was the significantly stronger and younger male.

'Luckily, both survived the battle and their wounds are now healed.

'For a photographer it's spectacular to see something like this, but as an animal lover it makes it very hard to watch.'
