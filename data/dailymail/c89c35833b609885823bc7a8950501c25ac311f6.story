Arsene Wenger admitted it was a big moment for Arsenal to finally win away from home against a big club as they beat champions Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.

A first-half penalty from Santi Cazorla set the Gunners on their way, before Olivier Giroud's header after the break ensured Wenger's side would return to north London with maximum points.

The win sees Arsenal move to within a point off the Champions League places and just three points off high-flying Southampton in third place.

After the game Wenger said: 'I felt we were well-disciplined, well-organised and kept good control of the game.

'I did feel as though we could have done even better on the counter attack and killed off the game earlier than we did.

'But it was a big moment for us winning away at one of the big teams.

'We also looked in control throughout and that is especially pleasing considering we are away from home.'

When asked if he felt the change in formation was paramount to the result Wenger shrugged off those suggestions, insisting the reason the team won was because everyone played to their full capabilities.

He added: 'I think it's more down to everyone doing well in their respective roles (than a change of formation).

'In many away games we have found ourselves one or two nil down before we have started to get into the match, and in 80% of those cases the team that takes the lead in a game then sets the precedent for the rest of the match.

'Today it was down to discipline. We fought well together as a team although some of the players were  physically short because they have just come back from injury.'

When asked if the result at the Etihad would now put him off delving into the transfer window for a defensive midfielder, Wenger simply replied: 'Sometimes the fact that you find solutions internally is a blessing so at the moment all is well.'

Midfielder Aaron Ramsey was effectively deployed in that role protecting the back four in the win against City, with the Welshman paying tribute to the team spirit on shown from the Gunners. 

He said: ‘We’re in a good place and we're all in it together. It’s not an easy place to come to (Manchester City) - many teams have been on the wrong end of a thumping here. 

'In the past we've come here and been too open as well, but today we defended well as a team and didn't give them any room or pockets of space to exploit, which Silva (David) can do to devastating effect.

'It was important for us to get the win with everyone else winning in the top half too, so hopefully we can build on this and have a good second half of the season.

‘We’re still in the Champions League, FA Cup and have plenty of games left in the Premier League to go too, so there's plenty to be positive about.'
