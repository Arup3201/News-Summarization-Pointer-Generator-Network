Blinded: Harvey Rowe was hit by debris after a railway detonator he and friends put on a fire exploded

A schoolboy has been blinded in one eye after an unmarked box of railway detonators he and some friends had put on a fire exploded.

Harvey Rowe, 15, entered a railway depot through a broken fence with two older boys and took some rubbish from a skip to build the bonfire.

When the unmarked box – filled with detonators used to warn maintenance crews a train is approaching in thick fog – started to explode as the fire started, he tried to kick it away from the flames.

Debris flew into his face and he was taken to hospital where surgeons operated to remove the fragments. However, they later told his parents Claire, 45, and Mark, 49, that he had been blinded in his right eye.

British Transport Police are planning to speak to Harvey when he has had time to recover.

Officers have already arrested two 17-year-old boys on suspicion of theft and interviewed them before releasing them on bail.

Mr and Mrs Rowe yesterday criticised Network Rail for leaving explosive devices where children could find them. Mother-of-four Mrs Rowe said: ‘Harvey is not the kind of boy who would go looking for trouble.

‘He’s predicted straight A-grades at school – we were just in  shock when we were told about  his injuries.

‘The doctors have told him he will never be able to see out of his  right eye again.’

Mr Rowe, a builder, added: ‘Network Rail has never had a problem with the kids grabbing crates  from there before.

Scene: The remains on the fire could be seen at the skate park near Leigh-on-Sea, Essex

‘Now my boy’s been injured they’re accusing them of stealing explosives. Why were the detonators there in the first place?’

Harvey was out playing with the older boys near his home in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on Saturday night. He was discharged from Southend Hospital the following day.

Speaking afterwards, with a  patch over his eye, he said: ‘We were building a small fire and just dumped a few bits from the skip  on there. One thing was an unmarked box but before we knew it, it started exploding.

‘We tried to spray the fire with water and I tried to kick the box off the heat but that was when I got hit in the face. Now I’m going to be paying the price for that mistake for the rest of my life.’

Railways detonators are used as a warning signal for train drivers.

About the size of a large coin, the detonator is strapped to the top of the rail with metal straps.

When
 a train wheel passes over it, the device emits a loud bang to warn 
drivers about a number of things including: dense fog, a train stopped 
on the line ahead or ongoing engineering works.

They are also used by signallers when they need to stop approaching trains in an emergency

The explosives can be dangerous if handled in the wrong way - throwing them onto bonfires for example.

Large pools of blood could still be seen splattered across the concrete yesterday at the skate park where the teenagers built the fire.

Skateboarders in the area described how the boys walked through a gap in a nearby fence which had been there for ‘months, probably years’.

One said: ‘I don’t know why they didn’t fix the fence before.

‘What he did was stupid but why the hell were they dumping detonators yards from a skate park?’

The damaged fence was fixed within hours of the accident.

Railway detonators are yellow disks of metal just over two inches in diameter and less than half an inch deep.

Maintenance workers line up three on the track when visibility is poor. They are triggered when a train runs over them, making a loud but harmless bang to warn them of the approaching danger.

Transport police said 31 had been recovered. It is not known how many were triggered by the fire.

A spokesman said: ‘They are very difficult to set off.  It takes the weight and impact of a train to set them off – but putting them in a bonfire is a different matter.

‘They don’t fragment much. It is possible the boy’s injuries were caused by something such as  splinters that came out of the fire.’

Detective Constable Michael  Bute added: ‘This is a tragic accident which has had very serious  consequences for the youngster involved.’
