A New York woman who faked cancer to win her estranged boyfriend back then racked in thousands of dollars in wedding donations has got her man to return to her once again.

When Jessica Vega, 25, told Michael O'Connell that she was suffering from a rare form of leukemia and had just six months to live - he immediately took her back. When he discovered that her terminal illness was a complete lie he swiftly divorced her. 

Now he has confessed to taking his wife back for a second time saying that he tried – and failed – to hate her despite the incredible web of lies.

Back together: Jessica Vega and Michael O'Connor are reunited despite her lies that she had just six months to live. The couple spoke out for the first time since Vega was released from prison last month, she was sentenced to 50 days on fraud charges

Speaking to ABC’s 20/20 he said: ‘I tried to hate her, it was an act’. Vega then chimes in saying: ‘You can’t help who you love.’

Vega and her boyfriend, who now have two children together, were going through a rocky patch when she told him she was battling leukemia and had six months to live.

O’Connell immediately took her back and the couple planned their dream wedding.

Explaining herself: Vega said that she told the lie to get O'Connell, the father of her two children, back

In 2010, Vega spread the word in her 
Hudson Valley community that she was dying of leukemia and wanted a 
'dream wedding' in the few months she had left.

Donors stepped up with rings, an 
embroidered wedding dress and a time-share in Aruba for the honeymoon. 
Other contributions included food, wine and hairdressing.

Friends and strangers donated more than $13,000 for the couple’s wedding and Caribbean honeymoon.

Vega was living in Montgomery, a town 
60 miles north of New York City, when she launched the scam, which 
picked up steam when her story was featured in a local newspaper, the 
Times Herald-Record of Middletown.

But after their May 2010 wedding, O'Connell came to the newspaper with questions about her story and the couple divorced.

As the truth emerged, Vega was arrested and, after pleading guilty to charges of fraud last April, she was imprisoned for 50 days.

Speaking out for the first time since being released from jail last month, Vega told ABC that she concocted her cancer, where she showed O’Connell a doctor’s letter and even cut her hair to make it more convincing, to get him back.

Asked if she couldn’t get his attention another way, Vega simply said: ‘I’m the mother of his children and he would not call me.’ The ploy worked – Vega immediately moved back in with O’Connell.

Footage from the couple’s wedding shows how Vega even weaved the lies into her marriage vows. 

Choked up with emotion Vega stares at her groom: ‘I want you to know the day I’m no longer physically here I will always kiss you goodnight.’ In the interview Vega says she ‘had to mention’ her ‘cancer’ during the vows.

The wedding video continues to show Vega dance the night away – a far cry from being riddled with guilt over her lies as she claims she was.

‘I regret what I did to people but I don’t know any female in [sic] the earth that would be depressed on their wedding day,’ she argued to ABC.

Vega also says she had help with the fraud, as a friend forged the letters from doctors about her supposed treatments, which Vega then signed.

Although Vega refused to disclose the accomplice’s name she said she was no longer friends with that person.

Jailed: The 25-year-old is unlikely to do any time in state prison, but she will have to repay $13,368 to her victims and remain in jail until her sentencing on May 15

Vega was arrested April 3 in Virginia, where she was again living with O'Connell and their second child.

With the help of Vega's father the couple have now paid back the duped donors.

During her sentencing hearing last month Vega's lawyer, Jeremiah Flaherty said Vega was sorry for what 
happened and hoped the people who showed her kindness aren't 
disillusioned or less likely to help others in the future.

'She got caught up in something and it just got out of hand,' Flaherty said.

Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, 
whose office prosecuted the case, said the plea means Vega 'will be held
accountable for fleecing the public through lies and deception.'

'By pretending to have a terminal illness, Vega inexcusably took advantage of the community's hearts and minds,' he said.

Vega married Michael O'Connell, the 
father of her one-year-old daughter Lily, on May 2, 2010 and the couple 
spent an exotic honeymoon in Aruba using donated plane tickets and a 
villa.

The reception 
was attended by 60 family and friends who had all give money to the 
tragic cause along with many strangers who read about Vega's plight in 
their town newspaper in Newburgh, around 75 miles from New York City.

Friends donated everything from her dress to a two-week honeymoon in the
Caribbean so that the then 23-year-old could enjoy a happy start to married 
life before succumbing to the disease.

She reportedly received thousands of dollars and wedding presents.

Four months later, O'Connell revealed that Vega had been faking the illness and he had been duped into marrying her after she showed him a letter from her doctors with the grim diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia.

Within weeks of returning from their 
honeymoon O'Connell, a construction worker, noticed that his wife's 
condition had not deteriorated.

He telephoned the doctor's office to ask questions about her cancer only to be told Vega was not a patient at the surgery.

The letter she reportedly had obtained from a doctor in Westchester was a forgery.

The couple divorced over the 
deception and O'Connell moved to Virginia to find work. 

Vega initially denied making up the cancer story and said at the time that she and her husband separated because he was physically abusive.

The local newspaper reporter who wrote the initial report attempted to 
accompany Vega to see her doctor but she failed to turn up for the 
appointment.

During the hearing O'Connell, who at one time gave evidence to prosecute his wife, said his wife needed mental health care and not prison.
