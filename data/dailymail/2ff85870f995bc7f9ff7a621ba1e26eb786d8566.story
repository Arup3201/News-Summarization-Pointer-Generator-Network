Leicester City have broken their transfer record to sign striker Andrej Kramaric in the hope that the Croatian will score the goals to help keep them in the Premier League.

It's a calculated gamble from the Foxes, who have weighed up the £9million fee paid to HNK Rijeka against the cost of relegation back to the Championship.

It's not the first time that a team in trouble has spent big in January. Here, Sportsmail looks at five other attempts by Premier League clubs to spend their way to safety.

Kostas Mitroglou to Fulham (£12million)

The Greek international came to Fulham on deadline day in January 2014 from Olympiacos, and the west London club had high expectations after paying a reported club record £12m. Prior to joining, Mitroglou had scored 17 goals in just 19 matches for the Greek champions, including a hat-trick in the Champions League.

Fulham pinned their hopes of survival on the 6ft 2in striker, and he made his debut as Fulham drew 1-1 against West Bromwich Albion, coming on as a substitute for Hugo Rodallega. However, due to various fitness issues, Mitroglou only made two further appearances for the club, and one was off the bench.

After his dismal first term at Craven Cottage, Mitroglou was loaned back to Olympiacos for the whole season, where the 26-year-old has once more, shown he is a top marksman, hitting 10 goals in his 18 appearances so far, including scoring the winner against Spanish champions Atletico Madrid in the Champions League.

Danny Graham to Sunderland (£5million)

With Sunderland desperately in need of a striker to help prevent relegation, manager Martin O'Neil turned to Swansea City's Danny Graham. The former Watford man had a decent record in his first season in the top flight, scoring 12 goals. However, in his second season with the Welsh club, he scored just three times in 18 appearances.

With Swansea ready to offload the forward, Sunderland spent £5m on the 29-year-old but things did not go Graham's way. The known-Newcastle United supporter was booed by Black Cats fans on his debut after coming on as a substitute against Reading.

And Graham never found his feet at The Stadium of Light, failing to score a single goal in 12 league appearances. The following season, he was loaned out to Premier League rivals Hull City, where he only managed one goal in 18 appearances. Loans to Championship sides Middlesbrough and Wolverhampton Wanderers followed, but Graham is yet to rediscover the form that earned him his Premier League status.

Christopher Samba to Queens Park Rangers (£12.5million)

After previous success in England with Blackburn Rovers, and after a difficult period in Russia with big-spending club Anzhi Makhachkala, Christopher Samba earned a move back to England with Queens Park Rangers.

However, the fee of £12.5m and his reported wages of £100,000 per week meant great pressure on his shoulders to keep the struggling Hoops up. Unfortunately for him, some of performances, especially in the 3-2 defeat to Fulham, came under considerable criticism and scrutiny.

He was unable to shore up the west Londoner's defence or save them from relegation to the Championship. He was sold back to Anzhi for £12m.

QPR boss Harry Redknapp said upon signing him: 'Chris is just what we need. He's a monster. Great in the air, quick, a leader, strong, fantastic in both boxes, hard as nails. He's a proper centre-half.' Unfortunately for Samba, that's not quite how he'll be remembered by the Loftus Road faithful.

Djibril Cisse to Queens Park Rangers (£4million)

With QPR languishing just above the relegation zone when Mark Hughes took over in January, goals were a necessity. So he looked to French striker, Djibril Cisse. 

The former Liverpool striker went on a great scoring run in west London, finding the net six times in eight appearances. However, his time was blighted by two red cards in his first five matches, with QPR going on to lose those fixtures.

The Hoops secured safety on the final day of the season, with a goal from Cisse, but despite his prolific start to his QPR career, the following season, he only managed three goals in 18 appearances, and was loaned out for the remainder of the campaign to Qatari club Al Gharafa.

Brede Hangeland to Fulham (£2.5million)

Fulham were struggling in the league, especially defensively, so a defender was a must for Roy Hodgson, whose side were in 18th place when he took over. The answer was to be the Norwegian man mountain, Brede Hangeland, signed for an undisclosed fee on 18th January.

He formed a good partnership with fellow centre back Aaron Hughes, as they fought to keep the west London club up. He would stay with the Cottagers for another six years, resisting temptations to move elsewhere when 'bigger' clubs were rumoured to come calling.

On his debut at Bolton Wanderers, he was voted man of the match and until the beginning of this season, he was at the heart of the Fulham defence.
