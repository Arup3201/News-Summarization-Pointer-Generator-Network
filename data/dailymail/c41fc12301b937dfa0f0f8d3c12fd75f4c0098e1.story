White fat cells are responsible for flab, but brown fat converts energy into heat. To make white cells behave like brown ones, researchers found a new signalling pathway called adenosine

Sit ups help tone your stomach, while squats strengthen your legs and bottom - but love handles are particularly difficult to shift.

Now scientists believe they have discovered a way to ‘melt’ the excess white fat in muffin tops by turning it ‘brown’.

While white cells are responsible for muffin tops and flab in general, brown fat cells convert excess energy in food into heat.

To make white cells behave like brown ones, researchers at the University of Bonn discovered a new signalling pathway.

‘Not all fat is equal,’ said Professor Alexander Pfeifer from the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology of the University Hospital Bonn.

‘If we are able to activate brown fat cells or to convert white fat cells into brown ones, it might be possible to simply melt excess fat away.’

By experimenting on mice, Professor Pfeifer discovered a new signalling pathway for a molecule called adenosine.

Adenosine is known to activate brown fat cells, and is typically released during stress.

The adenosine signal is transmitted  adenosine receptor A2A.

‘If adenosine binds to this receptor in brown fat cells, fat burning is significantly stimulated,’ claimed Dr. Thorsten Gnad from Professor Pfeifer's team.

‘The brown fat in mice behaves just as in humans,’ added Professor Pfeifer.

In addition, the research team investigated the possibility that adenosine transforms white fat cells into brown fat cells - a process termed ‘browning’.

White fat cells normally cannot be induced to burn excess fat by adenosine, because they lack the A2A receptor.

Adenosine (molecule illustrated) is capable of activating brown fat cells and is typically released during stress. The adenosine signal is transmitted by the adenosine receptor A2A. By transferring the A2A receptor gene in white fat cells in mice, they began 'browning' and burning energy

For this reason, the team of scientists transferred the A2A receptor gene from brown fat cells to white fat cells in mice.

Consequently, the white fat cells with A2A receptors started 'browning' and burning energy.

‘Through the administration of adenosine-like substances, the mice actually lost weight,’ continued Professor Pfeifer.

'Our results demonstrate that adenosine-A2A signalling plays an unexpected physiological role in [brown fat] activation and protects mice from diet-induced obesity. 

Those findings reveal new possibilities for developing novel obesity therapies.' 

However, many questions still need to be investigated, continued the researchers, and clinical application is 'still far off'.

The results are published in the journal Nature.
