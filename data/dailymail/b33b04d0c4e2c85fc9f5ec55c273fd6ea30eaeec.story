Ministers are wasting £25million a year keeping foreign prisoners locked up after they have served their prison sentences, the Government has admitted.

Almost 1,000 overseas offenders who have served their time are still behind bars because they cannot be deported, new figures have revealed.

Immigration Minister Mark Harper said the average length of time these foreign criminals stay in the UK after serving their sentence is almost nine months.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has attacked human rights laws for blocking the government's ability to deport foreign criminals and has suggested that the Tory manifesto will promise to scrap the human rights act

Officials are often unable to deport the offenders - who include rapists, paedophiles and murderers - because of human rights laws protecting their right to a family life.

Ten of the offenders have been able to stay in Britain for more than five years, Mr Harper said.

The failure to deport foreign criminals immediately after their sentence is costing taxpayers £30,000 a year for every offender - or £25million a year in total.

The revelation sparked anger among Tory backbenchers, while Labour accused David Cameron of 'incompetence'.

Overall, the number of foreign offenders awaiting deportation has risen by two thirds under the Coalition, from 491 to 850

Tory MP Dominic Raab attacked the revelation. He said: 'We need to get rid of them, it is crazy. What you are effectively seeing is a huge increase in risk because we are failing to remove people who are obviously dangerous.

'It is a perversion of the law and frankly to the average person it looks like a total lack of common sense.'

The figures emerged in parliamentary answer to Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan.

Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan accused the Government of incompetence after it emerged David Cameron had overseen a huge rise in the number of foreign criminals languishing in jail awaiting deportation

A total of 35 foreign prisoners have remained in jail for between two and five years, 100 for between one and two years and 705 for a year or less.

Mr Khan said: 'British jails are seriously overcrowded and rammed to overflowing. Yet data I’ve uncovered shows 850 foreign criminals who could be deported are clogging up prisons because of this Government’s incompetence.

'That’s the equivalent of two decent sized prisons just to hold criminals who should have been deported. The Government are offering words where there should be action and appear to have thrown the towel in on this. It will be left to Labour to act and deport these foreign criminals.'

Ministers are introducing legislation which will mean that criminals are deported first and that their appeals are then heard abroad to end the 'never-ending game of snakes and ladders' under the current immigration system.

The Conservatives are also expected to pledge to scrap the Human Rights Act as in the party's manifesto for the 2015 election and replace it with a British bill of rights.

Offenders from the European Union can be deported if they are sentenced to two year jail sentences unless they have committed drugs offences or sexual crimes, in which case they can be deported if they are jailed for one year.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'Those who come to the UK must abide by our laws and where they do not, we will take the necessary steps to deport them.

'We make every effort to ensure that an offender’s removal coincides with the completion of their sentence. Detention may be prolonged if an individual refuses to co-operate with the removal process or raises last minute challenges or there are difficulties obtaining the necessary travel documentation.

'Through the Immigration Act we are making it harder for those with no right to be here to avoid removal from the UK. It will cut the number of appeal rights from 17 to four and allow us to remove people while their appeals are ongoing.'
