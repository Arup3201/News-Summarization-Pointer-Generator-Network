She's about to hit her half century but one look at her new campaign and you'd never guess it.

Yasmin Le Bon, 49, looks the picture of youth as she models Winser London's AW14 offering.

Snapped up by the brand for the fourth consecutive season, Winser London believe that the supermodel and mother captures the spirit of their brand perfectly.

Fit at forty: Yasmin Le Bon may be 49 but she exudes youth in her new campaign for Winser London, which sees her modelling the British brand's AW14 range

'She is stunning, stylish and real,' said the founder. 'Yasmin juggles a busy career, family and husband, like so many women today, yet she always looks effortlessly elegant and is always fun to be with.'

For AW14 the colour palette is classically neutral, enhanced by pops of rich seasonal colour, including lots of reds - the hottest colour on the catwalks.

The collection, which is priced between £35 and £350, is full of silks, hand-combed cashmeres, wool and a hint of cotton.

Sticking with the seasonal trends, knitwear is key and jackets, coats, dresses and skirts are sharply tailored.

Trousers come either with super slim structured leggings or with wide, slouchy legs and the Winser trench comes with a shorter hemline designed for winter showers with pops of on-brand blue.

This isn't the only brand Yasmin has been lending her good looks to this year.

Yasmin was unveiled as the 
face and body of the Speedo Sculpture swimwear collection.

With more 
than thirty years of experience behind her, Yasmin has developed a 
handbook to help women overcome body issues and feel more confident and
 comfortable in their swimwear.

Speaking
 about this, Yasmin said: 'After spending 33 years on the 
modelling circuit I have heard all of the tricks of the trade.

Success story: She has also worked for Banana Republic, Calvin Klein, Versace, Chanel, Christian Dior and Avon

'The
 best advice I've received on looking your best in a swimsuit, is to 
wear it with confidence and a smile; it instantly changes your 
appearance.'

Yasmin became a household name in 1987, when she was snapped up by GUESS? to front  a campaign.

She then 
went on to become one of the highest earning models of the 1980s, 
appearing on the glossy covers of the first American and British issues 
of Elle.

She has also worked for Banana Republic, Calvin Klein, Versace, Chanel, Christian Dior and Avon.

She has three children, including her famous model daughter, Amber, with Simon Le Bon, lead singer of Duran Duran.
