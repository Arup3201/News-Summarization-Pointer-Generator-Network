It is a charming image that might well tempt a traveller to visit.

It’s just a pity that British Airways used a picture of Leeds Castle, in Kent, to advertise flights to the city of Leeds ... in Yorkshire.

While the northern metropolis boasts many great attractions, Leeds Castle, some 200 miles away in Maidstone, isn’t one of them.

The airline used an image of Leeds Castle in Maidstone, Kent, to advertise a getaway in Leeds, Yorkshire 

So tourists who bought tickets based on the advert – emailed to the airline’s customers alongside promotions for New York and Berlin – might have been a little disappointed when they reached their destination.

The case of mistaken identity was spotted by BA customer Ian Guildford, 48.

He said: ‘At first I thought, “Where’s that?”. I was thinking it might be somewhere in North or West Yorkshire that I hadn’t visited yet.

‘Then I thought, “That’s Leeds Castle”. I double-checked on the internet and there it was, the very same picture, in Maidstone, Kent.’

He pointed out that it would be easier to visit the castle from Heathrow, near London, than from the city of Leeds.

Off base: The airline has apologised for the 'silly mistake' and reassured customers pilots had 'no trouble' locating Leeds 

The city of Leeds in Yorkshire is some 200 miles away (pictured). The blunder was pointed out by baffled customers 

Mr Guildford, the director of a company that makes match programmes for Leeds United football club, added: ‘It’s one of those things that everyone worries about – that companies have a very London-based, South-based view of our country.

‘So when our national carrier doesn’t even know where Leeds Castle is, it makes you worry. I know that Leeds has a great deal to offer, but not that particular castle.’

In fact, the castle’s name has nothing to do with the city of Leeds, although it is linked to Leeds village, which is near Maidstone.

The word leeds, in this case, derives from esledes – an old English word meaning slope or hillside. There has been a castle on the site since 1119.

British Airways owned up to the error last night. A spokesman said: ‘We’re sorry for the silly mistake. Fortunately our pilots have no trouble at all recognising Leeds.’
