Emma Jones: She was a lovely young lady

A young mother was stabbed to death after she complained about thumping music from a party, it was claimed yesterday.

Emma Jones, 30, walked to a block of flats opposite her home at around 2am to ask partygoers to turn the music down.

During a heated argument Miss Jones was allegedly stabbed and collapsed on the floor.

Paramedics rushed to the flat and battled to save her but she died from massive blood loss.

Yesterday residents of the North 
Wales village of Penygroes claimed Miss Jones, whose five-year-old son, 
Llyr, has learning difficulties, had repeatedly asked revellers to turn 
down the music. She told them they were ‘keeping half the neighbourhood 
awake’.

One resident said: ‘To be stabbed to 
death for simply asking someone to turn down the music at a house party 
is shocking and awful.

‘You would think that any decent person would have apologised and abided by the request, especially at two in the morning.

‘She did such a good job with her son
as he suffers from severe learning difficulties – she was totally 
dedicated to him. Everyone is in total shock over this tragic death.’

Miss Jones was popular in the village
a few miles from  Carnarvon, and dozens of friends and residents have 
posted tributes online.

One said: ‘You are loved so much. I 
feel like a part of my soul has gone. You touched so many hearts. You 
were always there for many of us.’

The incident happened in the early 
hours of Saturday. Annoyed at being kept awake, Miss  Jones went over to
the flats  and asked revellers to turn down the music.

A resident said: ‘There was an almighty row. When the ambulance got to the flat there was nothing paramedics could do.’

Miss Jones’s son is believed to have 
been staying with his grandparents, who live nearby. The death came as 
Penygroes was due to hold a Christmas fair, with preparations for the 
community event filmed for the Welsh language channel S4C.

Elwyn Jones Griffith, a councillor, said: ‘The whole village is in shock. Nothing like this has happened before.’

Resident Jean Owen added: ‘It’s a terrible thing to happen in a village like this.

‘We know the families, we know the grandparents, both sides of the families. It’s terrible that such a thing can happen.’

Mrs Owen described Miss Jones as ‘a lovely young lady’.

Yesterday
North Wales Police said in a statement: ‘The  police have trained 
family liaison officers supporting the family of the deceased.

Last night Alwen Eluned Jones, 23, from the nearby village of Llanllyfni was charged with murder. She appeared before magistrates today and was remanded in custody.

Police said a man and woman had been released on bail without charge.
