Iran’s oil and gas revenues have dropped by a dramatic 45 per cent since sanctions were imposed by the West over it’s nuclear development programme.

The restrictions came into force in July under which the EU put a complete embargo on oil and gas from Iran, which eliminated 18 per cent of Iran’s export, and has led to financial collapse.

The result of these and further banking and trade sanction over the refusal to halt uranium enrichment, has seen oil exports drop 40 per cent in the last nine months, compared to the corresponding period last year, a senior lawmaker said.

The financial crisis has led to an inflation in the rial, which in October last year had lost over half of its value against the U.S. dollar.

Iran's June oil exports of 1.74 million barrels a day plunged to 1 million barrels a day in July when the sanctions were imposed, The International Energy Agency said.

The IEA said exports picked up to about 1.3 million barrels a day in November, but the future is still grim for a nation where crude oil exports account for nearly 80 percent of its foreign revenue.

Gholam Reza Kateb, head of the parliament's budget committee, confirmed the total reduction in oil and gas revenue. He said: ‘On the basis of the report, oil sales are down 40 per cent and income has dropped 45 per cent in the last nine months.’

Mr Kateb said details of the steep 
revenue drop emerged Monday in a report by Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi to
 the parliament on the status of crude oil and liquid gas sales.

Mr
 Kateb added that Iranian experts are predicting that the country will 
be able to export 1.5 million barrels of oil a day over the next year and hope to increase the country's export of oil byproducts as a way of bypassing the sanctions.

The Iranian government is preparing to 
present an austerity budget to parliament for the next Iranian calendar 
year, begining March 21, which would substantially increase income taxes
 as a way of avoiding a budget deficit.

Iran is under U.N. sanctions and Western oil, banking and trade restrictions as the U.S. and its allies believe Iran might be on a path toward producing nuclear bombs.

Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, aimed at generating electricity and producing radioisotopes to treat about 1 million cancer patients a year.
