Britain will work with the new regime in Egypt while not supporting military intervention, William Hague said yesterday.

The Foreign Secretary said the overthrow of Mohamed Morsi was a ‘dangerous thing’ that risks setting a precedent in the volatile region.

But he said the UK will be forced to work with the army-backed government to protect Britons and British firms in the country.

Yesterday it emerged that four officers from the UK military’s Joint Force Headquarters will fly to Egypt with Foreign Office officials in what Mr Hague called a ‘rapid reaction team’ to assist and give guidance to British nationals.

The officers will plan a contingency operation for the potential evacuation of Red Sea holiday resorts including Sharm El Sheikh, if required.

The Foreign Secretary told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that Britain wanted to see the return of a civilian-led government in Egypt as soon as possible.

‘We don’t support military intervention as a way to resolve disputes in a democratic system,’ he said.

‘It’s of course a dangerous precedent to do that, if one president can be deposed by the military then of course another one can be in the future – that’s a dangerous thing. 

‘It’s happened, so we have to recognise the situation will move on.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the Government did not support coups and wanted Egypt to a return to democratic rule as soon as possible

He added: ‘We recognise states not governments. We recognise the state of Egypt and we have to work with whoever is in authority in Egypt, we have to do that for the safety of British nationals.

‘We have to do that because there are so many British companies there. There isn’t really any question of not recognising a particular government.’ 

Speaking during his weekly phone-in on LBC radio, Nick Clegg said the Government did not support coups and wanted Egypt to a return to democratic rule as soon as possible. ‘I hope we will look back on this as a very, very painful phase of change for a country not accustomed to democracy and democratic transfer of power,’ said the Deputy Prime Minister.

David Cameron’s official spokesman refused to refer to the revolt as a coup – calling it instead a ‘military intervention’.

In America, Barack Obama has also avoided the word coup. This is probably because, under US law, Washington cannot give aid to a country where one has taken place.

In a carefully worded statement on Wednesday, the president said he was ‘deeply concerned’ by the military’s move to topple the Egyptian government and suspend its constitution. He said he had ordered his officials to assess what the military’s actions meant for US foreign aid to Egypt.

The US provides around £1billion a year in military and economic assistance and is considered a critical US security priority.
