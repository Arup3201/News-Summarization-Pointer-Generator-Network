Cindra Ladd claims that Bill Cosby drugged and then raped her back in 1969

The wife of Oscar-winning Hollywood producer Alan Ladd Jr. is the latest woman to come forward and accuse Bill Cosby of sexual assault.

Cindra Ladd, a philanthropist and former entertainment executive, claims that the comedian drugged and then raped her back in 1969.

'It was obvious to me that he had had sex with me,' she wrote in a Huffington Post blog. 'I was horrified, embarrassed and ashamed. There was a mirror above the bed, which shocked me further.'

Ladd recalls that she was 21, single and living in New York City when she met Cosby, then 32 and already married to his wife Camille.

When Cosby asked for her number she willingly gave it to him and they started hanging out and going for meals. 

One night the pair were supposed to see a movie, but when Ladd said she had a 'terrible headache' Cosby was quick to offer her a pill.

'I asked a couple of times what it was,' she wrote. 'Each time he reassured me, asking, 'Don't you trust me?' Of course I did. This was Bill Cosby.'

After that, Ladd says her memory was a blur although she vaguely remembered watching a Japanese samurai movie.

'I don't remember where the theater was nor very much of the evening,' she wrote. 

'What I do recall, vividly and clearly, is waking up the next morning nude in the bed of his friend's apartment and seeing Cosby wearing a white terrycloth bathrobe and acting as if there was nothing unusual.'

Ladd didn't however alert the authorities. 'It never occurred to me to go to the police,' she wrote. 'It was a different time and 'date rape' was a concept that didn't exist.

Cosby in 1969 and recently: Over the past three months, at least two dozen women have come forward alleging that Cosby had sexually abused them

Ladd writes that she thought she was the only woman who Cosby had assaulted, until other women started coming forward.

'I told my story to our attorney, who is also a good friend, because I was considering going public then, but eventually chose not to because the case was settled,' she wrote. 

'This is the first time I have chosen to speak out about that night. It is also the last time I intend to address it publicly.

'I have no plans to sue, I don't want or need money. I have no plans for a press conference or for doing any interviews,' she added.

Ladd writes that she has run into Cosby once since then in the late 60s. 

'In the years since that night I have crossed paths with Cosby only once, when my husband, a highly successful Oscar-winning film executive and producer, introduced me to him,' she wrote.

Ladd said she only told her husband Alan about the incident nine years ago, after another woman came forward with similar accusations

'I was shaking, wondering if he would recognize me by my unusual first name. His reaction spoke volumes. To Bill Cosby, I was just another stranger.'

Ladd said she only told her husband - the former president of 20th Century Fox and an Oscar-winning film producer - about the incident nine years ago, after another woman came forward with similar accusations.

Over the past three months, at least two dozen women, including former supermodels Beverly Johnson and Janice Dickinson, have come forward alleging that Cosby had sexually abused them.

Many of the allegations are decades old and fall outside the statute of limitations for criminal or civil cases. 

Cosby, 77, has not been charged with a crime and his attorney Marty Singer has dismissed the allegations as 'discredited' and 'defamatory.'
