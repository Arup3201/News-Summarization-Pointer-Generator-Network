Karim Benzema says Brazil were far superior than France as the five time World Cup winners cruised to victory in Paris.

In a repeat of the 1998 World Cup final – which France won 3-0 – Brazil ran out 3-1 winners at the Stade de France.

France took the lead thanks to a Raphael Varane header but Brazil hit back with goals from Oscar, Neymar and Luiz Gustavo.

France captain Karim Benzema was left frustrated with the defeat by Brazil

And France skipper Benzema says his side can have no complaints over the result.

He said: 'A defeat is never good. It was a tough game, high level. They were better than us, even if we put them in danger in spurts. We have not had enough risk-taking.

'To celebrate in these kinds of games, you have to be thorough from the first to the 95th minute.'

Oscar scored Brazil's first goal as they came from behind to beat France 3-1

Neymar also got on the scoresheet in the Stade de France

France play Denmark in a friendly in Saint-Etienne on Sunday, and Benzema was relieved to have a chance to rectify the mistakes made against Brazil so quickly.

'What's nice is that there is a game on Sunday and that should enable us to erase this defeat.'

And France goalkeeper Steve Mandanda agreed with his captain.

He said: 'They were superior, period. They were very solid at the back, and offensively as well.

'We did some good things, by opening the scoring and then having opportunities to come back.

'Good things like the worst should be analyzed. We must use this match to see what we are missing.'
