The one thing 14-year-old Moshe Kai Cavalin dislikes is being called a genius.

All he did, after all, was enroll in college at the tender age of 8 and earn his first of two Associate of Arts degrees at 9 - graduating with a perfect 4.0 grade point average.

Now, at just 14, he's poised to graduate from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

The talented teenager has also just published an English edition of his first book, 'We Can Do.'

The 100-page guideline explains how other young people can accomplish what Moshe did through such simple acts as keeping themselves focused and approaching everything with total commitment.

He's hoping it will show people there's no genius involved, just hard work.

'That's always the question that bothers me,' Moshe, who turned 14 yesterday, says when the G-word is raised.

'People need to know you don't really need to be a genius. You just have to work hard and you can accomplish anything.'

And maybe cut out some of the TV.

Although he's a big fan of Jackie Chan movies, Moshe says he limits his television time to four hours a week.

Not that he lacks for recreational activities or feels that his parents pressured him into studying constantly.

He writes in 'We Can Do' of learning to scuba dive, and he loves soccer and martial arts.

He used to participate in the latter sport when he was younger, winning trophies for his age group, until his UCLA studies and his writing made things a little too hectic.

Indeed one of the key messages of his book is to stay focused and to not take on any endeavor half-heartedly.

'I was able to reach the stars, but others can reach the "Milky Way,"' he tells readers.

It was a professor at his first institution of higher learning, East Los Angeles City College, who inspired him, Moshe says.

He didn't like the subject but managed to get an A in it anyway, by applying himself and seeing how enthusiastic his teacher, Richard Avila, was about the subject.

In We Can Do, which has been translated to English, Moshe explains how to accomplish a lot by keeping focus and approaching everything with total commitment. He's hoping to show there's no genius involved, just hard work

Mr Avila, he says, inspired him to write a book explaining his methods for success so he could motivate others.

It took four years to finish, in part because Moshe, whose mother is Chinese, decided to publish it in Mandarin, and doing the translation himself was laborious.

Han Shian Culture Publishing of Taiwan put the book in print, and it did well in Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, as well as in several bookstores in Southern California's Asian communities.

He then brought it out in English for the U.S. market.

Because of his heavy study load, Moshe has had little opportunity to promote the book, other than a signing at UCLA, where he also lives in student housing with his parents and attends the school on a scholarship.

After earning his bachelor's degree, the math major plans to enroll in graduate school with hopes of eventually earning a degree.

After that, he's not so sure. He points out that he's still just barely a teenager.

'Who knows?' he says, chuckling at the thought of what lies ahead in adulthood.

'That's a very distant future, and I'm pretty much planning for just the next few years. That's too far into the future for me to see.'
