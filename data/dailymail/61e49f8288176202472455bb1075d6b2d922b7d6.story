Tony McCoy has targeted a race-riding comeback in the middle of next week as he strives to regain full fitness before More Of That’s seasonal reappearance in the Bet365 Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury a week on Saturday.

The 19-time champion jockey was last in the saddle on November 5. He has been sidelined since while he recovers from an old rib injury he aggravated in a fall at Exeter.

McCoy said of More Of That: ‘He looks a very smart horse and he is the reason I’ve ended up taking so long to come back. I’ll hopefully now be OK for the rest of the season.’

The Irishman rode at Chepstow the day after coming off at Exeter but, experiencing continued pain, decided to take a couple of weeks off to fully recover.

He could make his comeback at Fontwell or Wetherby next Wednesday after an X-ray yesterday confirmed his recuperation is going to plan. McCoy’s extended absence has opened up an opportunity for Barry Geraghty, who has been booked to ride Taquin du Seuil in tomorrow’s Betfair Chase at Haydock.

The Cheltenham Festival winner was one of nine horses to stand their ground for the chasing feature, which also includes last year’s winner Cue Card.

Dynaste, who chased Cue Card home prior to winning the Ryanair Chase in March, is also in a strong field.

Silviniaco Conti, winner in 2012 and third 12 months ago, will join Taquin du Seuil in wearing cheekpieces for the first time after looking laboured in the Charlie Hall Chase this month on his first start of the season.
