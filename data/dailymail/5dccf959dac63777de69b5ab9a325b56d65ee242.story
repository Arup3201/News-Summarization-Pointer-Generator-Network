Ten years of lies and betrayal came to a dramatic conclusion last night when Chris Huhne was finally put behind bars.

The former Cabinet minister’s spectacular fall was complete when a prison guard led him in handcuffs to start an eight-month sentence.

The prosecution said the 58-year-old millionaire had tried to cheat justice with a ‘scandalous’ legal defence.

Vicky Pryce, who Huhne persuaded to take his speeding points and later divorced, was also given eight months for the same offence of perverting the course of justice.

Describing her as ‘controlling, manipulative and devious’, Mr Justice Sweeney highlighted her revenge campaign that ruined her cheating husband’s career.

He told the pair: ‘Any element of tragedy is entirely your own fault.’

Addressing Huhne, he said: ‘You have fallen from a great height albeit that that is only modest mitigation given that it is a height that you would never have achieved if you had not hidden your commission of such a serious offence in the first place.’

The former Liberal Democrat MP, who once harboured hopes of taking Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s job, had lied ‘again and again’ in what was a ‘flagrant offence’ of its type, he added.Huhne’s barrister said the catastrophe had torn his family apart.

‘He is a man laid bare,’ said John Kelsey-Fry QC. ‘He has two things left to which he can sensibly hope to cling. The support of his partner and loyal friends and the hope of a reconciliation with his children.’

He insisted however the politician was no bully and had not tried to impose his will on his family.

Once a powerhouse couple – a senior politician and a leading economist – Huhne and Pryce looked more like strangers on a bus when in the dock yesterday.

Their eyes failed to meet and they did not exchange a word. They sat 4ft from each other.

The case was conducted at huge public expense and Huhne is estimated to have spent up to £500,000 on his defence.

Yesterday it emerged that the Crown Prosecution Service is trying to recoup £117,558 in prosecution costs, £79,015 for Huhne and £38,544 for Pryce, plus an extra £31,000 from Huhne for a previous attempt to get the case thrown out. He is fighting the costs order.

Mr Kelsey-Fry said Huhne will pay costs that are ‘just and reasonable’ but questioned the prosecutions version of how events unfolded.

‘Mr Huhne would not for a moment cave at paying just and reasonable costs attributed to him for this case,’ he said.

‘He would not want to be in any sense a burden on the public purse, bearing in mind his defence.’

Despite the dubious record of becoming the first former Cabinet minister since Jonathan Aitken to be jailed, Huhne has already launched a PR initiative apparently aimed at limiting damage to his image.

In interviews hours before he was sentenced at London’s Southwark Crown Court he said he regretted not owning up earlier and accepted the judge’s conclusion that he ‘lied and lied again’.

He agreed his political career was ‘very clearly over’.  In another interview, he maintained that jail was ‘a fairly small bit of the total penalty’ but admitted ‘lawmakers can be many things, but they cannot be lawbreakers’.

Remarkably, he said he had hoped Pryce – described in court as fragile and a broken woman – would be acquitted instead of convicted at her jury trial. ‘I didn’t want her to go to jail,’ he said.

‘I told the kids and everybody else that. Revenge eats you up. It does worse things to you than to the person you are attempting to attack.’

The case came to a close just one day short of ten years from the moment a speed camera caught Huhne’s BMW doing 19mph above a 50mph limit on the M11 between London and Stansted.

It might have begun with a simple motoring offence but it led to a desperately risky and ill-founded attempt to weasel out of a driving ban, compounded by lies, complex legal wrangling and an arrogant belief by both Huhne and Pryce that they would get away with it. They didn’t.

What Huhne might not have bargained for was the vengeful determination of a woman scorned – Pryce’s repeated attempts to expose her philandering husband by spilling details to the press of his criminal secret over the speeding fine.

Nor, perhaps, did he imagine he would be ‘laid bare’ in a case that went ahead against his spurned wife for her part in the deception after he finally pleaded guilty, and she didn’t.

Yesterday he made a public apology in court claiming he ‘felt awful’ about dragging people he loved into what he described as ‘this gruelling experience’.

In legal mitigation it was clear that Huhne did not want to say anything derogatory about his ex-wife.

Perhaps significantly, the sole allegation he did reject was a claim from her that he forced her to abort one of their children, part of the evidence she gave from the witness stand.

Both defendants wore black as they stepped separately into the dock. Pryce had a red rose in her bag from an admirer outside court, plus a double pack of tissues. Huhne read from papers given to him by his legal team.

Their 26-year marriage ended more than two years ago after the exposure of his affair with Carina Trimingham, his 47-year-old PR adviser.

The tall brunette sat a few feet from the dock alongside Huhne’s father Peter, visible to her lover but out of sight of Pryce.

Sentencing the pair, Mr Justice Sweeney said: ‘To the extent that anything good has come out of this whole process, it is that now, finally, you have both been brought to justice for your joint offence.

‘Any element of tragedy is entirely your own fault.’

The judge said Huhne had lied to avoid prosecution for the offence – then compounded those lies by insisting Pryce had not taken the points for him, pleading not guilty, and by trying to get the case thrown out under abuse of process.

‘Whereas the truth, as you well knew throughout, was that Vicky Pryce had taken the points for you and you were guilty,’ the judge said.

Both Pryce and Huhne are expected to be released from prison after only two months with a tag and a strict curfew.
