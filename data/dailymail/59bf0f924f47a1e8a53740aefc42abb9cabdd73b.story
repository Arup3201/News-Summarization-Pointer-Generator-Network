Nathan Cleverly pauses, stutters and makes several false starts before deciding he can’t bring himself to do it.

‘I’m not going to give him the satisfaction of paying him a compliment,’ he says. ‘I could easily give him one but I don’t want to. Tony Bellew has no respect for me so why should I show him any?' 

Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew first clapped eyes on each other seven years ago at a weigh-in at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

Twenty four hours later, on the undercard of Joe Calzaghe’s career-defining unification victory over Mikkel Kessler, they each continued their ring education with routine wins.

They did not meet again until May 2011 when tempers flared at a press conference to promote their first fight. Bellew, who had accepted the challenge at 48 hours’ notice, failed to make the weight and had to stew for another five months before he could attempt to wrest Cleverly’s light-heavyweight world title.

He lost by majority decision in front of his home crowd in Liverpool but the itch remained unscratched and the bitterness allowed to fester.

Until now.

A devastating knockout defeat to Sergey Kovalev last year saw Cleverly move up to cruiserweight where he was soon joined by Bellew, ensuring a rematch was inevitable.

Each has had two warm-up bouts to prepare for their return to a sold-out Echo Arena on Saturday.

‘There’s a lot of hate involved,’ admits Cleverly. ‘We can market the fight as good v bad because I’m going about it the right way and he’s shouting his mouth off.

‘But for boxing as a whole, and for sportsmanship, it’s bad. There’s no place for it in the game. It doesn’t need that level of hostility. He goes past the point of professionalism and takes it one step too far.

‘He wants to hurt me and he wants to end my boxing career. He wants me gone from the sport because I’m in his way and stopping him moving ahead. He wants to inflict as much damage as he possibly can, there’s no doubt about it. But I’m going to deny him that because I’m a better fighter.’

Cleverly, 27, might be more subtle about his dislike for his opponent but is equally determined to settle the matter.

‘I need to silence this guy once and for all,’ he says. ‘He’s just there in the background, annoying me. He keeps opening his mouth, whinging and moaning and being disrespectful. He’s a nuisance.

‘It’s like being back at school. I used to like challenging myself and I got into a lot of fights and I would always aim for the guy who was bigger; the bully boy.

‘I’d set myself a challenge to take down the one who was loud, who was aggressive; the one who had that boldness. Tony is the same, he’s a bully boy. He’s a big guy, he’s got a big mouth and he tries to bully people.

‘But I’ve always said that in any walk of life, the way you beat a bully is to stand up to him and I stood up to Tony. I’ve taken him down once and I’ll take him down again. He’ll be silenced.

‘He doesn’t like me because I’m his big rival and I’m in his way. I’m the reflection of what he wants.

‘I was British, European, Commonwealth and world champion and he wanted those belts. We were both promoted by Frank Warren, we were both at light heavyweight and he wanted my position and he couldn’t have it. He hates me for that because I was denying him his opportunity.

‘I’ve already beaten him once and he’s still bitter.’ 

On the top floor of a quiet commercial gym in the Welsh valleys, Cleverly has just finished his day’s training. Later he will pound the pitch-black streets, alone and in his element.

Even the sound of a solitary gym goer’s skipping rope brushing the floor is beginning to irk.

‘I do enjoy my own company; in the gym and in life in general,’ he reveals. ‘It’s important to do that, it’s where I get most of my constructive work done. It’s where I learn the most.

‘I have a lot of thoughts going through my head, I evaluate life and I evaluate my fights. I picture my next fight, what shots I’m going to throw and how I’m going to win.

‘I was brought up with one of my brothers but generally I liked my own company. That’s why I entered a solitude sport like boxing.’

After his crushing defeat to Kovalev, Cleverly split with his dad Vince who had trained him since 2008 when his son left Enzo Calzaghe’s gym. After a brief spell with David Haye’s former coach Adam Booth in London, Cleverly returned to Wales and is now trained by his former strength and conditioning coach Darren Wilson who operates as a one-man band.

‘It’s difficult changing trainer in any circumstance, father or no father,’ reasons Cleverly. ‘You build up a great bond with a trainer and there’s a lot of trust involved but eventually good things have to come to an end. It was just time; it’s not the first case and it won’t be the last case of trainers and boxers going their separate ways.

‘I needed a fresh start and a fresh voice and deep down my dad understood that. We achieved an awful lot together and I’ve got to pinch myself sometimes. We went on an amazing unbeaten run with a lot of knockouts.

‘I was living the dream but things change and we move on. We still talk; we obviously don’t see each other as much now but we still talk.

‘He hasn’t been to my last couple of fights and we’re going to stick to that for this one. He was involved in a training capacity before and obviously not being involved now, it’s been difficult for him so I think it’s best we keep the boxing separate.

‘It’s hard being selfish but trying to please everyone gets you stuck sometimes. As I’ve matured, I’ve had to do what’s best for me.

‘I learned a lot from Adam but I was away from home and away from my comfort zone. The training was excellent but it was the location which didn’t work for me.

‘As a fighter I’ve got to be true to myself and if something is not working, I’ve got to change it.

‘I trust myself to do what’s best for me.

‘Darren has been part of the team for a long time. He’s honest, and I trust him. There are no frills.

‘He has a good work ethic and he’s in the sport because he enjoys it, not because he has to be. He wants success; the trust issue is a big factor. He’s a good friend as well.’

Cleverly, too, remains in the sport by choice.

Given the nature of his first career defeat in which he was knocked down twice before the referee spared him any further punishment in the fourth round, and his degree in maths, he could be forgiven for choosing a different path.

‘I’ve got such a good academic brain and I could have a comfortable life outside boxing,’ he says. ‘I could turn my hand to many other things but it’s boxing I’ve decided to do and to stick to because I’ve worked too hard to just throw in the towel; I’ve come too far.

‘I’m on the verge of big things again so to throw it away at this stage would be a real shame and something I could never forgive so for me it’s about giving it another crack and going to get another world title. That’s my goal and that’s what I’ve set out to do.’

These days, when Cleverly bumps into those playground bullies, there is a knowing smile and a shake of hands.

Will he afford the same respect to Bellew? ‘No, I don’t think so. I think too much has been said now.’
