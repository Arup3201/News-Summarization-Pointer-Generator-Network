There's no light at the end of the tunnel for the bitter cold gripping most of the country.

Another winter storm is expected to hit the Midwest and East Coast early this week, bringing even more snow and keeping temperatures below freezing.

The snow will start Sunday in the upper Midwest region through the Great Lakes and into the Northeast.

The storm is expected to drop 1-3 inches of snow in it's path with more accumulation expected for the cities of Chicago, Detroit and Cleveland who will get even twice the amount of snow due to lake effect.

Chicago has already received 45.4 inches this season, far above the average of 17.2 inches. The same goes for Indianapolis, which has seen 33.8 inches and normally sees just 14 inches. Philadelphia received 33.7 compared to the average of 7.9 inches.

The Northern Plains are expected to get the worst battering tonight, with blizzard conditions in the Dakotas, western Minnesota and northern Iowa.

The plains will also receive wind gusts over 60 mph as the weather conditions cause a 'life threatening situation' on the roads with zero visibility at some points.

Prices for propane haven't been this high since at least 1990 and demand is above supply in 20 states.

'I'm concerned. Concerned now because we don't know when we're getting it. We don't know if we're getting it and all the propane companies are kind of in the same boat,' propane company owner Scott Zura, of Ohio, told NBC News.
