Former AFL player Stephen Milne has received a hefty fine but avoided a conviction for indecently assaulting a woman 10 years ago.

The former St Kilda star, who was supported by wife Melissa, his father and brother, was fined $15,000 in Victorian Country Court on Tuesday after pleading guilty to indecently assaulting a 19 year old woman at a teammate's house after a drunken night out in 2004. 

The result in the long standing case comes after three rape charges against the former AFL footballer were dropped earlier this month.

Victorian County Court Judge Michael Bourke described the incident as a non-violent but physical sexual act.

He said both the victim and Milne had suffered due to the decade-long delay in bringing the matter to court, and described Milne as a different and far more mature man than at the time of his crime.

'The evidence is highly persuasive that this offending was out of character,' Judge Bourke said on Tuesday.

He accepted Milne was a man of good character who had suffered from the publicity of the high profile incident.

'You have been the subject of public scrutiny and public abuse,' Judge Bourke said.

'Your family has witnessed and been distressed by this.'

Milne, 34, had been due to face trial charged with three counts of rape later this month.

But he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of indecent assault on November 6 after the Office of Public Prosecutions withdrew the rape allegations.

Milne, admitted to indecently assaulting the woman in a darkened room, with former teammate Leigh Montagna and another woman nearby. 

Judge Bourke said the victim had believed Milne was Montagna.

Milne met his victim and her female friend at the St Kilda Football Club family day in March 2004, the day after the club won the pre-season premiership.

Milne, Montagna and the two women met later that night at Montagna's house and the offending occurred while all four were together in a dark room.

Judge Bourke described Milne's crime as unplanned and somewhat spontaneous but said he offended after the victim had been clear in saying no.

If Milne was convicted, the maximum penalty for indecent assault was 10 years' jail. 

He has six months to pay the fine. 

Earlier in November when the rape charges were dropped, Milne went to court supported by wife Melissa, St Kilda captain Nick Riewoldt and recently retired Saints midfielder Lenny Hayes.

At an earlier court appearance, Milne's barrister Philip Dunn QC asked Judge Michael Bourke to hand Milne a fine without conviction in relation to his indecent assault charge.

Mr Dunn said the offence was more than 10 years old and Milne had not offended since.

He described the offending as 'unplanned, spontaneous and momentary'. 

But Mr Dunn acknowledged Milne had offended after the victim had been clear in saying 'no'.

Milne retired last year after playing more than 250 game for St Kilda

'His recklessness was a misread of the situation,' said Mr Dunn in court early November. 

He also said Milne and his family had suffered a decade of abuse, in which crowds chanted 'rapist' at St Kilda's AFL games.

Mr Dunn described one incident in which Milne's partner took photos of his 250th AFL game and was insulted by a K-Mart employee when she went to have them printed.

'What do you want a photo of a rapist for?' she was asked.
