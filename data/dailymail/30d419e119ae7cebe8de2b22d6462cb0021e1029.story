Ed Miliband faced a growing crisis last night after a key aide threatened to quit over a vicious feud that has split Labour’s high command.

Furious Shadow Minister Michael Dugher told the Labour leader he wanted to resign, claiming he could no longer work with Douglas Alexander, who is masterminding the party’s General Election strategy.

Mr Dugher is said to have told Mr Miliband: ‘Douglas is totally bloody impossible. Everybody says it. You have got to do something about him.’

Ed Miliband calls for the party not to panic after a pool showed their lead over the Tories had disappeared have seemingly gone ignored after a row erupted within his Election team

The row intensified after it emerged that Election guru Arnie Graf, who mentored Barack Obama and was brought in to secure a Miliband win, has returned to his native US amid claims he was sacked by Shadow Foreign Secretary Mr Alexander.

And last week Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls was said to have snubbed Mr Alexander at a crisis meeting chaired by Mr Miliband.

The feud follows post-Budget polls suggesting the Tories have narrowed Labour’s lead to a wafer-thin one per cent. Labour support was last night pegged  at just 33 per cent.

Mr Miliband used a meeting of the Shadow Cabinet on Tuesday to issue a ‘Don’t panic!’ cry to MPs, saying ‘We must not be knocked off course by a few bad headlines or adverse poll results.’

It prompted one Labour MP to compare his response to Corporal Jones from Dad’s Army.

The rows relate to Mr Miliband’s ‘safety first’ Election strategy, spearheaded by Mr Alexander, which relies on the Tories losing votes to UKIP.

Mr Dugher is Mr Miliband’s ‘enforcer,’ tasked with leading Labour’s strategy against the Tories. He has had a series of rows with Mr Alexander, claiming he has been ‘shut out’.

Mr Balls was accused of ‘showing his contempt’ for Mr Alexander by refusing to respond after the Shadow Foreign Secretary’s 30-minute presentation to Cabinet colleagues on his Election plans.

‘Balls is usually first to speak, but arrived late and sat looking at his shoes,’ said one source. ‘He and Douglas hate each other. If Dougie found the Holy Grail, Balls would oppose it. It can’t go on, but Miliband is too weak to intervene.’ The departure of Mr Graf, 70, follows arguments with Mr Alexander, who is said to have regarded the American’s  strategies as a ‘waste of time and money’.

Mr Graf’s own credibility suffered a hammer blow when it was revealed he was in the UK without a work permit. The leak came shortly after he crossed swords with Mr Alexander.

Allies of Mr Graf claimed he was the victim of a dirty tricks plot by Labour enemies.

Mr Graf was a close ally of Labour policy review chief Jon Cruddas, who party insiders say was linked to a public letter last week by leading Labour thinkers urging Mr Miliband to be bolder in his Election plans.

Mr Dugher last night denied that he threatened to resign.
