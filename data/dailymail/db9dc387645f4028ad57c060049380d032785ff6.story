Vice President Joe Biden claimed that he came face to face with Vladimir Putin during a visit to Moscow in 2011 and told him: ‘Mr. Prime Minister, I’m looking into your eyes, and I don’t think you have a soul’.

Biden told the New Yorker he was touring then-Prime Minister Putin's office when he positioned himself several inches from the Russian politican's face and made the biting comment.

'And he looked back at me, and he smiled, and he said, "We understand one another"', Biden told the publication. 'This is who this guy is!'

'We understand one another': Biden told the New Yorker that when he met with Putin in 2011 he looked him square in the eye and said he didn't think he had a soul

Biden also told him, through an interpreter, that his office was 'magnificent.'

‘It’s amazing what capitalism will do, won’t it?' he said, a remark that reportedly had Putin laughing.

The Vice President sat down with the New Yorker as part of a profile piece it is running on him in its July 28 issue.

As part of it's article on Biden, the magazine also spoke with President Barack Obama.

Asked for his opinion on Biden running president for a third time in 2016, Obama said: 'I think Joe would be a superb President.'

'He
 has seen the job up close, he knows what the job entails. He 
understands how to separate what’s really important from what’s less 
important.

'I
 think he’s got great people skills. He enjoys politics, and he’s got 
important relationships up on the Hill that would serve him well,' Obama
 said.

Biden may seem like an unlikely successor to Obama, given their significant differences in age and management style, but one of Biden's political advisers, John Marttila, told the New Yorker that the two men have developed a genuine friendship in the last five years.

'Joe and Barack were having lunch, and Obama said to Biden, "You and I are becoming good friends! I find that very surprising," Marttila said. 'And Joe says, "You’re f***ing surprised!" '

The New Yorker piece also shared a behind the scenes story about a viral video of Veep star Julia 
Louis-Dreyfus and Biden that aired at the White House Correspondents' 
Dinner this year.

In the video Biden was supposed to cower before 
First Lady Michelle Obama after she finds the veeps eating from tubs of ice 
cream in the White House kitchen.  Biden refused to do the scene as written, however, because he thought it wasn't true to character.

'The First Lady comes and I’m going to cower? That doesn’t fit type,' Biden said.
