All smiles: Cuba's leader Fidel Castro appeared jovial when he appeared in public earlier this year, but he has not been seen since March

He may not have showed up for the party, but that did not stop the rest of Cuba celebrating Fidel Castro's 86th birthday yesterday.

Messages of congratulation were broadcast over the state media and cultural centres organised concerts in honour of the retired leader.

A special art show in the 
Plaza of the Revolution depicted moments in Castro's life from childhood
to his arrival as one of the most recognized figures in Latin American 
history.

The Union of Communist Youth also joined in with a small party featuring a huge cake and children singing Cuba's version of the 'Happy Birthday' song.

Government-run websites carried essays on
his life and best wishes were sent from presidents Evo Morales of Bolivia and 
Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua.

But through it all, the 'comandante' was nowhere to be seen.

Castro, who survived in power for nearly 50 years despite numerous attempts on his life and periodic rumours of his passing, still appears to have a strong hold on people's affections - even if he is not physically seen for months at a time.

He had stepped aside temporarily in 2006, due to an illness that he later said nearly killed him, and in 2008 he left the presidency permanently.

Younger brother Raul, who turned 81 earlier this year, took over.

Castro doesn't seem to have much of a 
hand in running the country, though he has publicly voiced approval for 
Raul's programme of economic reforms and the younger Castro says he 
consults with his brother.

The exact nature of Castro's illness was
never revealed and the status of his health is kept secret, but media 
reports said it was complications from diverticulitis, an intestinal 
ailment common in older people.

Despite being out of the limelight, Castro regularly published an opinion column titled 
'Reflections', which have often been lengthy essays on international 
politics.

These have often taken on the form of short, sometimes cryptic messages.

In one of the mysterious 
mini-'Reflections' Castro wrote about something called the 'FC' without 
explicitly saying what they were.

Others marvelled at yoga masters' 
flexibility, extolled the nutritive virtues of a tree known as moringa 
and reproduced six lines of poetry about Ernesto 'Che' Guevara.

But he has not published a column since June and Castro last appeared in photos and 
video in March.

At that time, Castro looked jovial, but thin and pale as he and companion 
Dalia Soto del Valle greeted a visiting Pope Benedict XVI.

As Castro passes yet another milestone, he is perhaps becoming increasingly aware of his own mortality.

He seemed to hint at this in a letter to his friend and ally Hugo Chavez in July, when the Venezuelan president turned 58.

'Fifty-eight years is nothing, Hugo,'
Castro wrote in the letter, which was posted online by Venezuela's 
office of the presidency and reproduced by Cuban website Cubadebate.

'I, who am almost 28 years older, have lived a great part of the last 100 years and can testify as to the meaning of time.'

Important figure: Despite not being seen in public for a while, Castro is still a large figure in people's lives

Without the public appearances and fewer published columns, rumours have inevitably begun to swirl over where Castro is - and how he is.

'Has Cuba converted Fidel Castro into a 
virtual figure?' opposition blogger Yoani Sanchez tweeted. 'He doesn't 
appear, but they tell us he's still alive.'

But it also seems that people do not have to see the famed revolutionary with their own eyes to keep believing in him.

'Just his being there, alive, gives 
people a lot of strength to keep working and fighting,' said Gerardo 
Cartaya, a 53-year-old self-employed cab driver in Havana.

In recognition of his birthday, Communist Party newspaper Granma also published memories of Castro from people familiar with him, such as Cuban journalists and cohorts from the 1959 revolution, which relate the awe with which people still hold him.

'Every time I meet with Fidel I feel like I have had to stand up and defend him against whatever they might want to do to him,' famed Cuban ballerina Alicia Alonso was quoted as saying in Granma's collection of memories.

'Every time I meet with him I feel nervous.'
