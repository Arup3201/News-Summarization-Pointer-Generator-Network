It has all the ingredients of a movie blockbuster: sword-wielding warriors in period costume set against an Ancient China landscape, complete with stunning sunsets, rolling fields and snowcapped mountains.

Except this isn't China at all... it's the Peak District, in Derbyshire.

Two filmmakers have shot a £20,000 trailer in the region for their war epic The Lost Emperor, with the aim of attracting Hollywood investment,

John Watts and Thomas Wood decided it would be better to make a spectacular five-minute showcase for their brainchild rather than a cheap full-length feature.

The Lost Emperor is a concept trailer for a feature film seeking investment. Made on a minimal budget entirely in the UK. Waiters from Chinese restaurants were called on to bulk out battle scenes.

Due to their tight budget, they even called in waiters from Chinese restaurants in their hometown 
Sheffield as extras to make set piece battle scenes look more authentic.

So far, 80,000 viewers have clicked on their trailer since it was posted on YouTube two weeks ago.

It seems their efforts have not gone unnoticed by Hollywood executives always on the lookout for the next blockbuster.

The success of 
2007's Mongol, which took nearly £17million at the box office, shows 
there is a market for the genre and now the filmmakers are in talks 
about making an £8million full-length feature film based on their 
script.

‘Instead of spending our meagre budget trying to make a cheap
film, we boiled the script down to just five minutes and made the best trailer
we could,’ said Mr Watts.

The changeable 
weather in the Peak District aided the pair making the trailer look more
'epic' and as though they'd 'been filming over several months', the 
32-year-old added.

But this may 
be Derbyshire's first and last brush with the brutal world of the 
medieval east, because if the US-backed production gets the green light 
the action is likely to relocate to China.
