A police officer bled to death after suffering 'torrential bleeding' following the birth of her second child at a struggling hospital, an inquest has heard.

Diane Patt, 34, lost five litres of blood and died hours after delivering her daughter because of ‘very serious failings’ at Colchester General Hospital in Essex, a coroner ruled today.

The mother-of-two, who died in September 2011 after staff failed to replace the lost fluids, might have survived with 'appropriate and timely treatment', coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said today.

PC Diane Patt, 34, died after suffering 'torrential bleeding' following the birth of her second child in September 2011

Mrs Beasley-Murray said: 'There were very serious failings in the care Mrs Patt received at Colchester Hospital.'

'Mrs Patt’s death was contributed to by neglect.'

The damning verdict also criticised a lack of leadership and failings in staff communication at the hospital, which was in special measures, with Mrs Beasley-Murray criticising ‘an unfortunate degree of chaos and confusion during events’.

Mrs Patt's husband, Sergeant Major Jason Patt, of Colchester’s 7th Parachute Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, told police: 'No one knew what the hell was going on.'

Mrs Patt, a police constable based near to her home in Colchester, Essex, had successfully given birth to her baby daughter by ventouse at 8.20pm on 18 September 2011 following a failed forceps delivery.

But problems arose soon after as staff noted PC Patt was suffering ‘torrential bleeding’ in the aftermath of the birth.

Estimates made at the time placed the bleeding at around 2.4 litres, while the real figure was more than double that, the inquest into Mrs Patt's death heard.

PC Patt was pronounced dead at 11.57pm with a post-mortem giving the cause of death as a massive haemorrhage which triggered cardiac arrest.

The three-day inquest, held at Chelmsford Coroner's Court, heard damning evidence from staff who admitted failing to replace lost blood.

Dr Lajos Zsisku, consultant anaesthetist on the night, admitted to the court: 'I would feel much more comfortable if I had given more blood.'

Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust released a statement apologising to the family, saying: 'Unfortunately, a massive haemorrhage can occasionally occur during natural childbirth and we deeply regret that Mrs Patt was not given the highest quality of care.'

  'My family has been devastated by the errors made by the hospital which has taken a wonderful mother and wife away from us.'

  - Sgt Major Jason Patt, widower

The statement said a raft of improvements had been implemented at the hospital but added: 'Nothing can now change the tragic events of September 2011.'

The damning case comes just months after an inquest into the death of baby Frank Gamble at the same hospital in April 2012 - staff were criticised for using ‘poor technique or excessive force’ with forceps, resulting in a fatal fracture to the child’s skull.

After the inquest into Mrs Patt's death, her widower spoke of his 'devastation' at his wife's death.

Sgt Major Patt, whose daughter survived the birth, said: 'My family has been devastated by the errors made by the hospital which has taken a wonderful mother and wife away from us.

'I had many unanswered questions before the inquest and I am pleased that the coroner has carried out such a thorough review.

'She identified a succession of very serious failings in Diane's care but my family will now have to deal with the consequences.

'I can only hope that the hospital learns from its mistakes so that the same does not happen to someone else.'

Paul Sankey, clinical negligence lawyer with Slater & Gordon, said: 'It is difficult to understand why anaesthetists failed to respond to Mrs Patt's very extensive blood loss and to give her adequate replacement fluids.

'It seems clear that with adequate management she would not have died and proper care would have avoided such a catastrophic loss to her family.'
