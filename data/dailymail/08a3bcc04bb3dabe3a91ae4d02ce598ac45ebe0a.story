A 31-year-old man has been charged with brutally hacking to death his mother and brother in the New Hampshire home that they shared. 

Shawn Carter, 31, of Belmont, was arrested Tuesday and charged 
with killing his mother, 59-year-old Priscilla Carter and his brother, 39-year-old Timothy 
Carter on May 24 in their home at 20 Sunset Drive.

The mutilated bodies were found the morning of May 24.

The medical examiner’s office determined Priscilla Carter’s cause of death was multiple chop wounds and blunt force injuries, while Timothy Carter’s cause of death was multiple chop wounds. The office did not say what kind of weapon was used.

Shawn Carter has been incarcerated since the bodies were found, but until now, he has not been charged with a crime related to the murders.

He was arrested during a traffic stop just three hours after the bodies were discovered on May 24. His charge at the time was for driving with a suspended license and he has since been kept in jail on a $200 bail.

He has been unable to post bail and the state tacked on another charge unrelated to the murders in mid-June. The new charge accused him of selling cocaine to an undercover officer in March of 2012.

His lawyer has described him as handicapped and poor, according to the New Hampshire Union Leader. The lawyer did not elaborate on how he is handicapped.

Carter is expected to be arraigned Wednesday at Laconia District Court.

Belmont is a town of 7,000 residents about 25 miles north of Concord.
