Claire Winter, 39, dropped from 24st to 17st 7lbs while on the weight loss show. Since filming ceased she has managed to lose a further 3st 7lbs and now weighs in at 14 stone.

Claire decided to take part in the Biggest Loser following a holiday to South America with her ex-husband.

The disastrous trip - which XXXXX - made her realise she needed to tackle her weight, and she plucked up courage to apply for the show.

Claire had never been comfortable with her size, having gained weight steadily throughout her teens. But the most rapid weight gain happened when she went to university.

Claire's weight reached 24 stone and began to impede on her life, preventing her from participating in activities and causing her embarressment

With constant yo-yo diets causing fluctuations of up to a stone or more throughout her life, her weight steadily crept up to 24st.

Though she aware her weight was too high, it was a holiday to South America that brought the issue home.

Claire said: 'Rather than one defining moment, there were a number of things that pushed me to lose weight. I went travelling round South America with my, now, ex-husband, and a number of things about the trip affected me.

Claire was unhappy with her weight but felt she couldn't control it. Now she has a new lease of life

'Firstly, clothing was an issue. It was really hard to buy some necessary items, such as waterproof trousers, in my size and, when packing, my clothes took up more space which made packing lightly impossible.

'On the trip itself, my weight impacted what I could to. Whilst trekking in Patagonia I was unable to take part in all of the walks; having to do the shorter options or, in some cases, completely miss out as it was too much for me.

'I felt very conscious of my size on the flights, especially when asking for seatbelt extenders. Flying with my then-husband made me feel a bit better as I could take up some of his space but, when I flew alone between Ecuador and Rio, I ended up sat between a couple of larger gentleman and it was very uncomfortable for all of us.

Claire says the problems her weight caused while she was traveling in South America inspired her to apply for The Biggest Loser

'Little things, individually, built up - things in everyday life that made me feel uncomfortable, both emotionally and physically, and made me want to change.'

In 2011, Claire found herself walking up to the Biggest Loser house with her sister-in-law Sara.

Claire battled on the show to became the female with the biggest percentage weight loss, managing to lose in total 6st 6lbs.

After the show, Claire pursued her new found passion for exercise, finding that participating in exercise classes kept her motivation high.

Claire said: 'The energy and enthusiasm of the instructors always lifted me to work harder however tired I was and regardless of how much time I had spent working out that day or week.'

Inspired by the classes by fitness brand Les Mills, Claire decided to become a fitness instructor: 'I decided to train in my favourite class: Bodycombat.

'I found that I could get rid of all of my frustrations and lose myself in the class, punching and kicking to the music. I would always come out smiling, knowing I'd worked hard, so I decided to start teaching.'

Claire says she loves inspiring others to losing weigh but doesn't believe in punishing yourself

Claire is now a qualified fitness instructor and personal trainer, and she has shed over 10st in total.

Claire says that her weight loss and new fitness has totally transformed her life: 'I teach classes in a number of centres, work in a gym and am a personal trainer to people in their own homes. I have so much more confidence now that I am fit and strong. 

'Knowing that I am physically capable of so much translates into added mental confidence which transfers into everything I do. 

'My family have also noticed that I am happier, confident, and have loads more energy.'

Claire also loves that she inspires others to lose weight, and advises people to to make the lifestyle changes to improve their quality of life.

'I know that my weight loss has inspired lots of people to lose weight and get fit. 

'People that have followed my journey on the show and people that have seen me working out in the gym and changing shape over the last couple of years have seen what I've done and know that change is achievable. 

'In my opinion you can make it hard for yourself or you can make it easy, it's a question of how you approach it.

'The key thing is to remember you always have a choice; you can eat what you want and you can do as much or as little, as you want - but you need to accept the consequences of that decision.

'The best thing is to find what works for you: there is no magic answer for everyone. 

'Find exercise you enjoy, change a couple of things at a time and, most importantly, enjoy the journey.

'It's not about punishing yourself, it's about treating yourself well - enjoying learning what your body is capable of and how much better you feel when you eat healthily and exercise. 

'Don't obsess over a number on the scales as it can be affected by so many factors.

'Instead, concentrate on how you feel, and look at your clothing size or measurements. 

'Of course, people told me these things before my journey, and I had to go through the process to discover it for myself.

'The best thing you can do is start making changes now. Don't wait until tomorrow, or Monday.'
