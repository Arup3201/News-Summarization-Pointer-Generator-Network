The aptly-named Middle Earth is a hidden paradise set on 19 hectares with pockets of rainforests and rivers spread across a valley nestled between two mountains in the Byron hinterland in northern NSW.

Listed for $3.1million, the original farmhouse was originally built in 1978 and has been extensively renovated by owner Leanne von Stolzenheim who purchased the property in 2007.

Ms von Stolzenheim has added new buildings, including two barns, and transformed two sheds into an office and a laundry room.

There isn't a room in the house without spectacular sweeping views of the property which boasts three creeks and a billabong, and even a natural spring. 

The two barns, which are used as art and music studios, have open plan living spaces, stable doors and hoop pine walls and ceilings - with one even featuring a day bed.

The expansive retreat boasts five bedrooms and three bathrooms with one set outdoors providing views of the tranquil luscious green surroundings while being able to gaze up at the vast rural sky.

Cattle are also currently being agisted by a local farmer on the property which covered walkways that run between buildings and there are many outdoor entertaining areas with broad sweeping views.

There are also six rainwater tanks on site with a total capacity of 62,000 litres.
