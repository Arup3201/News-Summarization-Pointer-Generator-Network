Doctors, dentists, nurses and midwives who can't speak English well enough may be struck off under new draft legislation published today.

Health regulators in charge of the UK's 1.4million health workers will for the first time be given powers to bar professionals simply because their command of the English language is considered so poor as to 'impair their fitness to practise'.

The Law Commission's new draft Bill covers nine bodies ranging from the General Medical Council (GMC) to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).  Social workers in England will also be covered.

Care: Doctors and dentists may be struck off if their English is poor under new draft legislation published today

The Regulation of Health and Social Care Professionals bill has been drafted to improve safety for patients who might be at risk when under the care of a health professional who can't communicate with them properly.

The 2008 case of German doctor, Daniel Ubani, who accidentally killed Cambridge patient David Gray, 70, when he confused two drugs and gave him ten times the recommended dose of diamorphine, highlights the risks of doctors with poor English working in the UK.

Currently the nine bodies, which also cover chiropractors, osteopaths, opticians, and pharmacists, are bound by different rules on what they can do to govern health workers with poor English.

At the moment, some can only investigate once they have received a formal complaint, and others can only investigate if the medic with poor English is suspected of having made a mistake already.

The NMC has loose guidelines which put the onus on checking the professional's English with the employer, and are not able to strike them off simply because of the language issue.  Meanwhile the GMC can only check the language skills of workers if they are from outside the EU.  The regulations for the GMC, however, will change later this year when new rules come in to force allowing the testing of medics' language skills before they can work.

Today's new draft Bill states: 'We want the regulators to have powers to investigate concerns relating to a professional’s knowledge of English before specific instances of deficient performance occur.

Midwives will also be governed by the new legislation which covers 32 health professions (file picture)

'This new ground should include, for example, inability or likely inability to communicate a diagnosis or advice to patients and service users, or an inability to read dosage levels when administering medication.'

The sanctions regulators can impose will be extended and, for the first time, they will be able to discipline or strike off professionals who are not able to communicate clearly in English.

The Bill also allows regulators to reconsider cases that have been closed following a mistake or error, as recommended by the inquiry into the scandal at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust.

A process of revalidation, where professionals undergo 'MOTs' to ensure they are still fit to practise, will be extended from doctors to all health and social care professionals.

Schemes could also be introduced to bar unregulated workers from providing services, according to the UK-wide recommendations.

Nicholas Paines QC, the commissioner leading the project for England and Wales, said: 'The professional regulators of the health and social care field operate within a wide variety of legal frameworks that have been agreed and amended by Parliament in different ways, at different times, over the past 150 years.

'Our recommended reforms place patient protection firmly at the heart of a new legal framework.

'If implemented, they will enhance the autonomy of the regulators, empower them to respond more quickly and effectively to emerging public health concerns and enable them to meet the demands of a modern, devolved health and social care sector.'

A joint letter signed by the regulators calls on the Government to support the new plans and asks for 'urgent parliamentary consideration' of the Bill.

It said: 'The recommendations of Robert Francis QC following events in Mid Staffordshire highlighted the vital importance of effective regulation focused on promoting safe, compassionate patient care rather than, as too often in the past, intervening only after patients have suffered harm.'

Jackie Smith, head of the NMC, said: 'I would strongly urge the Government to include this Bill in the timetable for the last parliamentary session.

'Without it the NMC cannot modernise its “outdated and inflexible” decision making processes.'

In 2008, 70-year-old David Gray died after he was given a fatal dose of diamorphine by German out-of-hours locum, Daniel Ubani.

Ubani was working on his first shift in Cambridge when he saw Mr Gray, who was suffering from kidney stones.  He gave Mr Gray ten times the correct amount of painkiller after confusing two drugs.

That same year, it emerged that foreign doctor Lucius Okere was allowed to work as a locum for ten months despite having such poor English, he didn't understand 'crash call' - the basic medical term for heart attack - thinking it meant car crash.

Victims: David Gray, 70, and Ena Dickinso, 94, both died after they were treated by doctors with poor English

The Nigerian-born doctor, who qualified in Bologna, Italy, didn't know how to perform CPR, didn't wash his hands properly, and slapped patients to see if they were conscious.  He was eventually struck off by the GMC in January 2011 after it emerged that no-one in Britain had checked to see what work he had done in Italy before coming to Britain.

Also in 2008, Lincolnshire grandmother Ena Dickinson, 94, lost nearly half the blood in her body during what should have been a routine hip operation after German doctor Werner Kolb severed an artery and became so flustered he started speaking in German.

Another doctor had to step in to sort out the chaos but the accident left Mrs Dickinson bedbound, and her inability to walk led to her developing pneumonia that killed her eight weeks later.
