In the closing stages of this game, we were on familiar territory. Manchester United were close to victory and were exerting pressure. One shot was saved by the Burnley goalkeeper while another was hacked from the line. It could have been 4-1.

Half an hour earlier, however, things were very different. Here was the real picture of this dispiriting night for the biggest club in English football.

Back then – early in the second half – the United lead was 2-1 and they were firmly on the back foot, where they had been most of the night.

Wayne Rooney – playing as a defensive midfielder – was being booked for persistent fouling and United were being booed by a small section of the Old Trafford crowd.

They were not booing individual players, though some of them may have deserved it. No, they were showing their displeasure at something much worse. They were booing the style – the nature – of their team’s play.

It wasn’t everybody in the ground – far from it – and it didn’t last long. But it was unmistakably there.

It was there as United broke away and then, with a numerical overload beckoning, started to funnel the ball backwards towards the halfway line. It was there again, minutes later, when Rooney turned and played a free-kick from opposition territory back in to his own half.

Over the years, we have seen just about everything at this great stadium. Most of it good, some of it not so. This, though, was almost unprecedented. United being outpassed, outplayed, outrun and outthought by a team that began the game in 19th place in the Barclays Premier League.

Burnley were fantastic. Their midfield was superior all night, Michael Kightly emerging as the star. Particularly in the first half they threatened to take United apart. They dominated possession, created chances and scored a very good goal.

Somehow, however, the Lancashire team ended the half a goal down. United managed to bookend the opening 45 minutes with set piece goals for Chris Smalling. In between those goals, however, there was only one team playing any football.

Right from the start, Burnley were at it and United weren't. In the very first minute, former United central defender Michael Keane headed wide from a corner when it looked easier to score. We presumed it would be a rare offensive movement but we were wrong. We should have known better.

Soon after, Phil Jones went off injured and Smalling came on. Within 21 seconds he scored.

A super volley from Patrick McNair was saved but when the corner arrived, a spot of head tennis saw Radamel Falcao nod the ball across for Smalling who gave United the lead with his very first touch.

Momentarily that seemed to settle United. They had an early lead and, historically, that has meant only one thing. On this occasion, though, against this United team, Burnley merely steeled themselves and proceeded to dominate the game for the next half an hour.

Within the first 15 minutes of the game they created four clear chances.

Ings' 12th minute header to equalise was a beauty, the striker peeling subtlely away from Smalling to convert a cross from Kieran Trippier.

As well as that, Kightly broke down the left and made David de Gea save, an Ings shot from a corner hit his own player almost on the goal line and a curling effort from Ashley Barnes missed by a foot.

For a while it was embarrassing for United. Kightly was running the game, dumping Robin van Persie on his backside to steal possession one moment and nut megging Rooney to dart in to the penalty area the next.

At the other end, Falcao and Van Persie were awful. Neither could hold the ball up. Neither found space.

Ultimately, though, Burnley didn’t score another goal and just as a patient home crowd were beginning to despair, United broke away to edge back in front.

Rooney and Angel Di Maria worked a short corner on the right and when the South American crossed to the far post Smalling leapt above Keane to head his team back in to a most unlikely lead.

Certainly it was tempting to wonder where the game would go from here. Would United take something from the fact they were ahead and go on to play some football? Or would Burnley continue to forage forwards in search of a reward they knew was there for them?

The first few minutes of the second half told its own story. George Boyd eased down the right for Burnley and when he crossed, Smalling and Anders Herrera – on in place of injured Daley Blind – got in each other’s way to present Ings with a straight forward chance.

Ings should have buried it. It was in his territory. This time, though, he hesitated and then contributed a poor first touch. That gave De Gea the chance to block at his feet and the rebound then flew over.

Maybe that was the decisive moment of the game. Had Burnley scored at that point, United may have fallen apart. The crowd reacted impatiently. They knew what they were watching, they recognised the signs of a team mired in uncertainty, welded fast to a formation they aren’t uncomfortable with.

Rooney’s role was remarkable. Pushed backwards by Blind’s exit, England’s captain and most prolific modern goal scorer spent his night so far away from the opposition net it was a wonder he could even see it.

Bit by bit, minute by minute, in this rare atmosphere, United somehow edged towards a most unlikely victory. Di Maria appealed for one penalty and then finally won one in the 81st minute.

Burnley – clearly tiring – lost possession from their own corner and when Di Maria broke, Scott Arfield took him down and Van Persie converted the penalty.

At strange night, a strange result. Van Gaal called it a “lucky win” and on this occasion he didn’t need any pieces of paper to convince us he was right.
