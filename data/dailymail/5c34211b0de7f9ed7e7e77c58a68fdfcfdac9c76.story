Eric Daniels was at the helm of Lloyds when it received a £20billion bail out from taxpayers in 2008

The former boss of Lloyds who ran the bank while it defrauded taxpayers and racked up a £10billion bill for mis-selling PPI last night faced calls to give up his £192,000 a year pension.

Nicknamed the ‘quiet American’, Eric Daniels was at the helm of Lloyds when it received a £20billion bail out from taxpayers in 2008.

But the 62-year-old, from Montana, has managed to maintain a low profile.

While the disgraced former boss of Royal Bank of Scotland Fred Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood and part of his bumper pension, Mr Daniels’ £4million nest egg – worth £192,000 a year - remains intact.

And as the bank he ran for almost a decade was fined £218million for an extraordinary scam to rip off taxpayers, Mr Daniels was spotted at lunch at the exclusive White’s Club in Mayfair.

This is conveniently close to the offices of consultancy firm StormHarbour, where Mr Daniels is employed as a senior adviser.

Lloyds is the first lender to be fined for an extraordinary scam which enabled it to gain tens of billions of pounds in emergency funds from a Bank of England lifeboat scheme during the financial crisis, while fiddling the system to cut the fees it paid to use the scheme.

Between April 2008 and September 2009 traders cut £7.8million off the fees Lloyds paid to the Treasury by manipulating the ‘repo’ rate which set the level of the fee.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said staff involved in the scam could be guilty of ‘criminal conduct’.

Staff at Lloyds could also yet face a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office which has been handed the evidence by City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority.The latest scandal has led to renewed calls to jail rogue bankers.

Although there is no suggestion that Mr Daniels was aware of the wrongdoing, it occurred under his watch.

So too did the manipulation of Libor interest rates which occurred between 2006 and 2009 and for which Lloyds has also been fined.

Last night, Mr Daniels faced pressure to ‘show contrition’ and forfeit some his pension.

John Mann, a Labour MP and member of the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘The buck stops at the top. Eric Daniels should show contrition and hand back his pension. There should be no rewards for failure and wrongdoing.’

John O’Connell, from campaign group the TaxPayer’s Alliance said: 'The Libor scandal and PPI mis-selling have rightly angered millions of customers, and given that taxpayers were on the hook for Lloyds during some of this reprehensible behaviour, many would feel better if Mr Daniels were to hand back part of his pension pot.’

The pressure on Mr Daniels could increase tomorrow (Thurs) when Lloyds is expected to announce it has set aside another £500million compensation for customers mis-sold payment protection insurance scandal.

This will take its total bill for the scandal to more than £10billion.

The state-backed lender has already punished Mr Daniels for the scandal by using its powers to recover a £1.4million deferred shares bonus awarded to Mr Daniels in 2010 which he had not yet pocketed.

But it is understood to be powerless to dock some of Mr Daniel’s pension as he is already receiving it.

The only chance of this happening is if Mr Daniels follows the example set by James Crosby, the disgraced former chief executive of HBOS.

Crosby last year forfeited his knighthood and £175,000 of his £580,000 annual pension.

He said he was ‘deeply sorry’ for the disaster that unfolded at the banking giant after he left in 2006.

HBOS was rescued by Lloyds in September 2008 after years of reckless lending forced it to the brink.

Lloyds was crippled by the toxic loans and had to be rescued by taxpayers the following month.

The latest row comes as the Bank of England is expected to today unveil new powers forcing staff at British banks to hand back bonuses up to seven years after they have received the money - even if they have spent it.

Under the current regime, banks can only typically recover bonuses which have been awarded but not yet paid out.

The new rules will be implemented on January 1 but will not apply to bonuses awarded before then.

Yesterday there were also calls for bankers to swear an oath to raise standards after a string of scandals.

An extract from the oath, suggested by thinktank ResPublica, says: ‘I will do my utmost to behave in a manner that prioritises the needs of customers.’

Another part says: ‘I will confront profligacy and impropriety whenever I encounter it, for the conduct of bankers can have dramatic consequence for society.’
