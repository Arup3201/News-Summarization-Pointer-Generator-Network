The Russian economy is set to plunge deeper into the abyss, after a  desperate interest rate hike failed to halt a slide in the value of the battered Russian rouble.

As a result of plummeting oil prices and Western sanctions over Ukraine, the entire Russian stock market is now worth less than the market value of Microsoft.

However, the Russians are concerned with a more pressing crisis: they are running out of buckwheat.

Buckwheat has been a Russian staple for centuries, and is used for everything from porridge to casseroles and baking.

The grain is particularly associated with the Soviet era, and buckwheat, or 'grechka' in Russian, is eaten across the country's timezones and social classes.

Following a poor annual harvest in Siberia, Russians are now bulk-buying buckwheat, and taking selfies proudly displaying their bounties. 

One young fur-clad lady has snapped herself flashing a wad of cash and a bowl of buckwheat, while another picture show two men in military uniforms pretending to cry over spilled buckwheat in the snow.

Others show young Russian women clutching buckwheat to their hearts, or filling a trolley to the brim with bags of the grain

But while the population worry about missing out on their favourite porridge, President Vladimir Putin has more pressing matters to attend to.

In the early hours of this morning, Putin's central bank ramped up interest rates from 10.5 per cent to 17 per cent in a desperate bid to save the battered rouble.

The currency has lost around half its value this year due to falling oil prices and the impact of Western sanctions on Moscow over the annexation of Crimea and 'destabilisation' of eastern Ukraine.

While there are few overt signs of panic, the 1am move from Putin's central bank showed the level of concern in the Kremlin.

The rouble initially rallied but slumped again as the move produced mixed results. 

Despite its name, buckwheat is not releated to wheat and is not a grain, but a fruit seed related to rhubarb.

It is recommended as a substitute to those suffering from gluten intolerance and has a very low GI.

It is considered a staple food in Russia and some parts of eastern Europe. It can be eaten as a rice-replacement, but is commonly used to make porridge.

Ground down, buckwheat flour is used to make blinis and bread and to thicken sauces and casseroles.

Russia was the world's number one buckwheat producer until it was overtaken by China. 

News agency RBK forlornly compared the entire Russian stock market capitalisation at the close on 14 December at $384.9 billion with the Microsoft Corporation at $386.6 billion and Apple at $643.9 billion.

It warned of a risk of falling below Google - at $352.7 billion

Russians have seen a marked rise in prices of essentials in recent weeks as inflation bites, and today there was a warning of another 15 per cent rise in early 2015.

The Bank of Russia said today's hike was 'aimed at limiting substantially increased rouble depreciation risks and inflation risks'.

And as if the buckwheat shortage was not enough, Russians may find an increase in prices across the foodgroups. 

'Foodstuffs will be getting more expensive simultaneously in the luxury and economy chains,' warned Andrei Karpov, the executive director of the AKORT association of retail traders.

'The price rises will embrace imported foods and Russian produce in an equal measure.' 

There is now 'a growing sense that the currency crisis is spiralling out of control' and increasing speculation that government could undertake stricter measures like capital controls, warned Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist at London-based Capital Economics.

'In the absence of an improvement in relations with the West and a lifting of the economic and financial sanctions on Russia, the appeal of capital controls and external debt default will grow.'
