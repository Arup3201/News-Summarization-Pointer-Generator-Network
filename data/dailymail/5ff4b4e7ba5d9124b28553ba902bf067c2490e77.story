An elderly woman from Surrey who was caught cycling along the M25 has been issued with a penalty notice, police have said.

The 74-year-old was using the motorway as 'a short cut' when she was spotted riding on the hard shoulder between junctions 10 and 11 in Surrey, officers said.

The unnamed woman, from New Haw, Surrey, was escorted off the M25 and issued with a £50 fixed penalty notice, Surrey Police said.

A police spokesman said: 'She was cycling in the same direction as the flow of traffic and using the motorway as a short cut.

'She was transported off the motorway with her bike in the back of the police car to a safe location on a traditional road.

'She was issued with a fixed penalty notice of £50 and given words of advice by the officer.'

It is not the first time a cyclist has attracted police attention riding along the M25.

In June, a 44-year-old man from Ghana was arrested after cycling on the hard shoulder and was found to have overstayed his immigration visitor's visa.
