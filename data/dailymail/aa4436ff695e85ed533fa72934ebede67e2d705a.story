West Ham forward Enner Valencia celebrated an extra special festive period with the birth of his second daughter on Christmas Day.

The Ecuadorian, who joined the Hammers for £12million in the summer, has had a whirlwind year on the pitch too, scoring three times at the World Cup in Brazil before heading to east London.

Speaking to the West Ham website, Valencia said of the birth:

'I became a father to a baby girl called Amelia. It's a huge blessing for the family and we are all very excited. It's my second child, I already have a three year old girl called Biera.'

There was no rest for the 25-year-old though, who headed across the capital on Boxing Day to play the full 90 minutes against league leaders Chelsea, before coming on as a substitute against Arsenal 48 hours later.

In his first half-season at Upton Park, Valencia has scored three Premier League goals, and helped the Hammers to sixth in the table.

'2014 has been a great year for me,' Valencia continued. 'I have been able to make the most of all the opportunities that have arisen. I scored three goals at the World Cup and played in some very exciting matches. 

'I am very thankful that West Ham spotted me and that I am able to play for such a big club.

'It's very special to play in the Premier League. I'd like to thank West Ham for giving that opportunity. I am really enjoying my time here. I am working very hard in training so I can perform to my best ability.

'I won the Ecuadorian title in 2013 with Emelec. My success there gave me the chance to move to a foreign team. I joined Pachuca. In six months there I scored 18 goals which was a great period for me.'
