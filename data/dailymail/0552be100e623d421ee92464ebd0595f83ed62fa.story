The baby boy is thought to be the first Union Jack in the UK

This is Union Jack, the baby born during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

The two-week-old baby, whose full name is Union Jack Neil Smart, is thought to be the only person in the UK with the unforgettable name.

His parents Kevin Smart, 47, and Becky Parker, 38, said they named their fifth child in tribute to the Queen after he arrived on June 6 in the wake of the huge four-day jubilee celebrations.

With the bunting still hanging on the walls, the couple, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, could not resist the quirky choice despite Miss Parker's early hesitation.

Kevin, a baker, said: 'My sister-in-law was suggesting names and said because of the Jubilee, it ought to be William or Harry.

'I suddenly thought Union and the middle name could be Jack and I rushed to the hospital to run it passed Becky.'

Becky, 38, said: 'My first thought was no, but I have really warmed to it. It has just stuck.

'All the nurses thought it was lovely because of the Queen’s Jubilee and all the celebrations.'

The couple have checked online and can’t trace any other 'Union Jacks' in the UK.

The new baby joins brothers Oscar, two, and Joshua, three, along with older siblings Siobhan, aged 10, and 14-year-old Hayden.

However, not everyone is keen on the name, with Kevin’s mum concerned that Union Jack could be teased as he grows up.

But Kevin said: 'I’m sure he’s going to be OK - it’s a special name and people will like it.'
