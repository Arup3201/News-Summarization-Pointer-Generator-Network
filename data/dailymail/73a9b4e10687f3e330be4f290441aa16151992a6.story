Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a
leading opponent of President Barack Obama's restoration of ties
to Cuba, called on the administration on Tuesday to cancel talks with Havana  until dozens of detainees
are released.

The promised release of 53 people Washington considers
political prisoners was part of Obama's Dec. 17 announcement
that he planned to normalize relations with Cuba after decades
of hostile relations with the island.

'The expectation right now is that they've already made this commitment and we expect them to live up to it,' Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, told reporters today, noting that the Raul Castro regime promised to release the group not just to the U.S. but also the Vatican.

But State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said during her daily briefing that releasing the prisoners is not a pre-condition for holding talks or the eventual normalization of relations. 

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio wants the Obama administration to cancel talks with Havana until dozens of detainees are released

State plans to begin hammering out details of opening a new embassy in Cuba even if all the prisoners are not released, Psaki said.

The White House has steadfastly refused to give out the names
of the 53 or even confirm the number of detainees.

'We’re not in a position to talk about specific numbers,'  Earnest said today.

'We’ve been careful about talking about the number of prisoners and who they are because we don’t want to put an even bigger target on their back as political dissidents,' he explained.

Psaki confirmed on Tuesday that some
had been set free a day after saying she could not publicly
confirm that even one had been let go. She did not provide a
number.

'They have already released some of the prisoners. We would like to see this completed in the near future,' she told reporters.

The State Department official indicated on Monday that the Obama administration likely wouldn't release the names of the dissidents who were held even after they are no longer in captivity.

'We’re not going to outline who those individuals were,' she said. 'I don’t expect we’ll be releasing a public list.' 

A source with knowledge of the agreed prisoner release told Reuters the delay stems from lack of a final deal on where the prisoners will go - leaving for the United States or Europe, or staying in Cuba.

In the past the Cuban government has preferred that such prisoners leave the country when released. But someare likely to insist on their right to stay in Cuba and continue fighting for their political rights. 

The fate of the detainees has provided ammunition for
congressional critics of Obama's policy shift. Rubio, who is the son of Cuban immigrants, and others
have said they will seek to slow or block moves toward improved
ties with Havana.

Lawmakers are expected to hold hearings on Obama's Cuba
policy in the first weeks of the new Congress, which was sworn
in on Tuesday.

Rubio said Roberta Jacobson, the assistant secretary of
state for Western Hemisphere Affairs, should cancel a trip to
Havana later this month to discuss normalizing relations at
least until the 53 are released.

'To date, no information has been provided about the political prisoners to be released – regarding their identities, conditions or whereabouts, even on a confidential basis, to members of Congress,' Rubio, a Florida Republican and possible presidential candidate, said in a letter to Obama today.

'Just yesterday, your own State Department was unable to provide an explanation about the political prisoners in question.'

The freshman lawmaker reiterated his position that the Obama administration's new Cuba policy is 'flawed' and contended that 'the least your Administration can do now is hold the regime accountable' for freeing not only the 53 dissidents but political prisoners who have since been detained.

'A failure to do so will further embolden the regime to continue its oppression,' he said.

'Almost three weeks after your Cuba announcement, there is
absolutely no reason why any of these individuals should be in
prison or the targets of repression - or for their identities,
conditions and whereabouts to remain such closely held secrets.' 

The White House has steadfastly refused to give out the names of the 53 or even confirm the number of detainees. 'We don’t want to put an even bigger target on their back as political dissidents,' Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said today

Several mostly Republican members of Congress, led by Rubio
and other Cuban-American lawmakers, have expressed deep concerns
about Obama's decision to ditch a half-century of U.S. isolation
of Cuba.

They argue that Obama's policy shift provides legitimacy -
and money - to the island nation's Communist government even as
it continues to violate the human rights of its people.

Whether the discord amounts in the long run to anything
more than speed bumps on the way to wider detente remains to be
seen.

But at a minimum, they illustrate how benefits from
Obama's ditching of a half-century of U.S. isolation of Cuba
won't come quickly or without rancorous debate.

On Tuesday, Obama discussed Cuba with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto during a White House meeting. 

Pena Nieto pledged that his country would be a 'tireless supporter' of the 'audacious' move to normalize relations. 

Signaling that it will continue to suppress dissent, the
government of Cuban President Raul Castro on Tuesday detained
more than 50 activists, dissident leaders said, to squelch a
planned gathering in Havana's Revolution Square. 

And dissidents
reported new detentions on Thursday.

The crackdown brought sharp condemnation from the U.S. State Department. All of those detained had been released by the weekend, dissidents said.
