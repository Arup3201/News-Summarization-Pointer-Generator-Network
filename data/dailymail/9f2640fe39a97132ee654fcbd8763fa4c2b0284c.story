Facebook: The company's chief privacy officer says users should 'never' have to give out passwords in job interviews

Two U.S senators are calling for an investigation into the practice of asking for Facebook passwords in job interviews so that interviewers can 'look through' accounts for information that might be concealed from the public.

The practice, which has horrified privacy campaigners, could be against Federal law.

Facebook itself has already said that the practice - which has been documented at several American organisations - is a violation of its terms of use and could potentially lead to legal action.

Chuck Schumer, a Democratic senator for New York Schumer, along with Richard Blumenthal, 
Democratic senator for Connecticut are calling on the 
Department of Justice and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
to investigate the practice. 

Schumer said, 'In an age where more and more of our
personal information - and our private social interactions - are 
online, it is vital that all individuals be allowed to determine for 
themselves what personal information they want to make public and 
protect personal information from their would-be employers. This is 
especially important during the job-seeking process, when all the power 
is on one side of the fence,'

The practice is already highly controversial.

The American Civil Liberties Union who says that the 
practice is a clear violation of personal privacy. 

Facebook's chief privacy officer, 
Erin Egan, stepped in on Friday in a post which said, 'If you are a 
Facebook user, you should never have to share your password.'

The
social networking company says that it would even consider suing firms 
that use the practice.

It also warns firms could open themselves up to 
legal challenges from job candidates.

'We have worked really hard at Facebook to give you the tools to control who sees your information,' says Egan.

'That’s
why we’ve made it a violation of Facebook’s Statement of Rights and 
Responsibilities to share or solicit a Facebook password.'

Job applicants 
at the Maryland Department of Corrections were asked to allow the 
interviewer to watch as the applicant logged into Facebook and clicked 
through photos, messages, and wall posts that were behind the privacy 
wall.

In a post on Friday,
Facebook's chief privacy officer cautions that if an employer discovers
that a job applicant is a member of a protected group, the employer may
open itself up to claims of discrimination if it doesn't hire that 
person.

They say that while ‘shoulder 
surfing’, as the practice is called, may technically be voluntary, the 
vast majority of applicants feel obligated to open up their lives to 
their employers or risk losing the job.

Sharing made very easy: Employers are making job candidates list their password information for Facebook and their email accounts on some applications and others are asking them to take them on a tour during the interview

An
extreme case was that of Robert Collins, who had been working for the 
Department for years before they asked him to give his email and 
Facebook logins.

‘Here I am, a us citizen who hasn’t 
broken any laws, who hasn’t committed any crimes, and here I am having a
prospective- well, not prospective in my case- an employer, looking at 
my personal communications, my personal posts, my personal identifiable 
information,’ he said in a video produced by the ACLU.

Others strongly request that 
the candidate opens their pages in front of them and allow their 
would-be bosses to scroll through their private information during the 
interview.

Outraged: Robert Collins already worked at the Maryland Department of Corrections when they asked him to hand over all personal login information

‘It’s an absolute and total invasion and total overreach on their part,’ Mr Collins said.

Following
his case, the Department suspended the policy for 45 days before 
compromising on ‘shoulder surfing’ as an alternative.

Trouble maker: Marvin Austin posted about making very expensive purchases while still a student prompting an NCAA investigation and changed school policies

While
the prospect of revealing the inner workings of your social life seems 
daunting, it has only lead to serious consequences in a few cases: of 
the 2,689 applicants that the Maryland Department of Corrections 
examined, only seven were denied the position based on items 
interviewers discovered behind privacy walls.

In addition to creating an awkward situation for potential employers, it also forces them to break Facebook policy.

‘You
will not share your password ... let anyone else access your account or
do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account,’ 
the site’s policy stipulates.

Facebook
spokesman Frederic Wolens spoke with MSNBC and while he would not 
comment on the specific case of the Maryland Department of Corrections, 
he speculated that the practice was against the site’s terms of service.

‘Under our terms, only 
the holder of the email address and password is considered the Facebook 
account owner. We also prohibit anyone from soliciting the login 
information or accessing an account belonging to someone else,’ he told 
the news site.

In
an effort to avoid this situation, the University of North Carolina has
instated a policy that forces student athletes to ‘friend’ at least one
of their coaches so that they can constantly monitor what the students 
put online.

That school’s 
worries come from experience, as former football player Marvin Austin 
posted about making very expensive purchases while still a student. The 
post prompted an investigation by the National Collegiate Athletics 
Association, and, in turn, the school’s privacy policy.
