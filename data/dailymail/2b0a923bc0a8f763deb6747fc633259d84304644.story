One of Michelle Obama's favorite colors has been chosen by Pantone Inc. as the color of the year for 2014.

Following this year's pick of emerald green, the purple hue of an orchid, officially known as Radiant Orchid, is set to pop up in everything from fashion and beauty to home design and other consumer products.

'It's a little different, it's a little off the beaten path, and it's not a primary color,' said Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute.

'It's an invitation to innovation. The purple family offers (an) opportunity to do creative things,' she added.

The First Lady is already well versed in the power of purple. From her black tie gowns to her shift dresses and skirt suits, Mrs Obama has made no secret of her love for jewel-toned color.

'People associate purple with creativity and originality -- and those are very valued today,' explains Ms Eisemen.

Pantone sets color standards for commercial use by design industries. Twice a year the company hosts, in a European capital, a two-day meeting of representatives from various nations' color standards groups to select a color of the year.

off the beaten path, and it's not a primary color,' said Leatrice

The result is published in Pantone View, an index that fashion designers, florists, interior designers and many other consumer-oriented brands use to help guide their planning for future products.

Ms Eiseman expects people will take to it quickly because it is a flattering color for many skin tones and complementary neutral colors, but it will also look like something people haven't seen in a while.

'This is an opportunity to look at what you've already got in your closet and add to it. It will feel like the right amount of change,' she said.

The runways and red carpet have already had a few orchid moments; even menswear has seen hints of it, with Salvatore Ferragamo and Ermengildo Zegna incorporating it into ties and trims.

'It's very relevant for spring, but I 
think even going into next fall it can be very pretty,' said Colleen 
Sherin, senior fashion director of upscale department store Saks Fifth 
Avenue.

'In ready-to-wear, it mixes with other tones like chocolate browns, and burgundy or Bordeaux makes for a deeper, richer tonal story.'

Ms Sherin has invested the retailer's resources in orchid, and an orchid-colored Gucci handbag has already been photographed for a Saks ad. It will translate just as well into lip color and eye shadow, and in home furnishings, she said. 'I would love it in velvet. It would look so luxurious.'

It is also a paint color and could be used in everything from upholstery to kitchenware and even menu choices.

'We're seeing more of these infused desserts and cocktails, and I can see them embellished with orchid flowers.'

Ms Eiseman said the sign of success in her world is when she sees a color on a coffee maker, and one in orchid is already in the works.
