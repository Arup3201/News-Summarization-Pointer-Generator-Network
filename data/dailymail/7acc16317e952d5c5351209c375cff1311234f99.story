In an interview conducted for an upcoming documentary film about the 2012 terror attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya at the consulate in Benghazi, Florida Senator Marco Rubio slams then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her agency's failure to protect Americans assets in the turmoil-prone North African country.

If she runs for president, he warns, she will have to explain what happened and how her agency failed.

'I think that ultimately, if Secretary 
Clinton runs for office in the future,' Rubio says, 'she is going to have to explain 
why, during her helm at the State Department, one of two things 
happened.'

'Either, number 1, they were aware of a security situation in 
Libya and failed to act accordingly, or, number 2, they had such a bad 
operation that they were not aware of it.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

In a segment released by the filmmakers, Rubio predicts that Hillary Clinton's performance as Secretary of State in the wake of the Benghazi attack will present a barrier to her presidential aspirations

In congressional testimony, Hillary Clinton said she never handled security requests for the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. But the Republicans' report found a diplomatic cable that indicates otherwise

The film, titled Benghazi 9.11, also includes interviews with Arizona Senator John McCain and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. All three are Republicans.

'They're stonewalling us,' Graham says of the State Department in the movie trailer.

The trailer also features Rubio calling Obama administration's failure to produce information to Congress an 'outrageous effort to not allow us' in the Senate 'to see the full record' on the terror attack.

Republican members of Congress have also been critical of the administration for not allowing survivors of the attack, who number more than 100, to testify on Capitol Hill or talk to lawmakers.

On Tuesday, House Republican leaders of five congressional committees released a scathing 46-page report castigating the Obama administration for its performance in Benghazi before and after the Sept. 11, 2012 attack.

The report singles out Clinton for a special level of scorn, accusing her of facilitating a government coverup.

The ranking Democratic members of the five committees wrote to House Speaker John Boehner and urged him to withdraw what they said was a 'partisan report.'

'You are unnecessarily politicizing our national security,' they wrote.

In the report, Republicans allege that the administration scrubbed references to al Qaeda from talking points about the Benghazi attack without justification, in order to protect Obama in the middle of an election campaign from allegations that he wasn't adequately protect American interests for terrorists.

White House officials and their State Department counterparts 'altered accurate talking points drafted by the intelligence community in order to protect the State Department,' according to the report.

An armed group of Libyan terrorists attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on Sept 11, 2012. On Tuesday a group of Republican House committee chairman blamed the Clinton-led State Department

The report quotes e-mails from State Department officials just three days after the attack which expressed worries that earlier drafts of the talking points had already been circulated.

Comparisons between the two drafts, the emails conceded, could cause 'serious concerns' in the White House that lawmakers would dress down the State Department for 'not paying attention to agency warnings' about security threats to the Benghazi consulate.

The White House has said it removed the references in order to prevent the release of classified information from compromising the FBI's investigation into the attack, but the Republicans' report said there was no evidence to support that claim.

'There were no concerns about protecting classified information in the email traffic,' the report says.

U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the Benghazi attack. The Obama administration originally claimed the terrorist attackers were protesters angered by a low-budget film that lampooned the Muslim prophet Muhammad

It also described a diplomatic cable that Clinton signed on April 19, 2012, proposing to reduce security at the State Department's facilities in Libya, including the one in Benghazi.

The cable 'acknowledged then- [Ghana] Ambassador [Gene] Cretz' formal request for additional security assets but ordered the withdrawal of security elements to proceed as planned.'

In her January 23, 2012 testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Clinton claimed she never personally handled security requests that impacted Benghazi

'I didn't see those requests,' she told the House committee. 'They didn't come to me. I didn't approve them. I didn't deny them.'

Clinton has been rumored as a possible Democratic presidential candidate since her retirement from the State Department on February 1.
