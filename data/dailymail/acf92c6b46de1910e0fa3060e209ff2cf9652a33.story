Family services are investigating a Chicago family after their five-month-old twins were found unresponsive in their crib.

Mother Victoria Rodriguez, 19, told reporters that she found the twins, Giselle and Julian, in the same crib, apparently not breathing. They were unresponsive even after she splashed cold water on their faces, she said.

The young mother said she put a blanket over them earlier this morning and said they may have accidentally suffocated.

Emotional: Father Josue Romero, 26, said he came home to find his 19-year-old wife crying on the floor

She said each child had their own crib, but were found together.

The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services is looking into the deaths of Giselle and Julian, and had previous allegations of neglect against both Victoria, and her husband, Josue Romero, 26.

The family lives in Chicago’s Little Village neighbourhood, one of the city’s most prominent areas for Mexican immigrants.

DCFS spokesperson Jimmie Whitelow said that the agency had contact with the family in March of 2011 after they received reports of neglect and abuse against Romero and an uncle.

According to the Chicago Sun-Times, DCFS had a pending investigation for a neglect complaint from April 9.

Romero told the Sun-Times that he thought it was an accident. He recounted: ‘I saw her crying on the floor in shock.'

Guilt: Romero said his wife takes the blame for their children's deaths; she believes they suffocated in their sleep

He said she kept crying 'the babies!', adding that she told him their children were in bed, but that he didn’t ‘want to see.’ He added: ‘I’m shocked and sad.’

The father said that the twins were having trouble sleeping Wednesday night, and his wife went in to calm them. He was up early Thursday – around 8:30, he said – to take their older children to daycare.

The young couple have four other children between the ages of one and five, two from Romero and two from Rodriguez. Autopsies for the two children are scheduled for Friday.

Rodriguez, who told the Tribune that she is unemployed, also voiced fears over how she and her husband will cover costs of their funerals.

The twins were born November 17, 2011, and were premature. However, Romero said they were ‘getting chubby’ and enjoyed talking to each other.

Experts said that both children dying of SIDS – sudden infant death syndrome – is highly unlikely, but not impossible.

The risk for SIDS increases if babies sleep on their stomachs, with an adult, or are born severely prematurely.
