A 15-year-old Iowa girl was found dead in the backseat of a car in an alleyway behind a retail store on Saturday morning, and police are trying to piece together how she died.

Council Bluff police were called to the alley behind a J.C. Penny store about 10 a.m. Saturday with reports of a body found inside a vehicle that was parked in the alley.

Inside, police found the body of 15-year-old Mireya Mata-Alvarez.

Mystery: 15-year-old Mireya Mata-Alvarez was found dead in the back of a car after a night of partying with friends

Authorities say the girl was out Friday night with a group of seven other teens and that she was with the group for much of the evening.

'After speaking with some people, it sounds like the girl, two of her 
female juvenile friends, and then five juvenile friends, were driving 
around partying, basically, last night,' Sgt. Chad Meyers told KMTV. 'We believe 
there was drinking and probably the use of marijuana involved.'

It remains unclear what killed the girl, but authorities say foul play is not suspected.

Tragedy: Mata-Alvarez had recently moved to Missouri, but was in Iowa visiting friends at the time of her tragic death

Mata-Alvarez had gone to nearby Lewis Central High School, but has since dropped out.

Friends of the girl say she moved to Missouri a few months ago but was back in Council Bluff visiting for the weekend.

Authorities currently are awaiting the results of an autopsy and toxicology results before determining her cause of death.
