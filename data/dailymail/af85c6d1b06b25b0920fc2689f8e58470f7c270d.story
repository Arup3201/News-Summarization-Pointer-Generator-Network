If you had driven past the St Pancras Hotel in London this Thursday you would have thought the billionaire Arab playboys were back in town again.

There was a queue of over £5m worth of supercars were parked in a line for the start of the DodgeBall Rally 2014.

Two Ferrari 430 spiders, Lambourghini Gallardo and an Aventador, a McLaren 12C, a Ferrari California, Audi R8, and my latest toy, the gorgeous Caterham Seven Roadster.

Raring to go: Spencer poses with the supercars outside the St Pancras Hotel

A small but perfectly formed pocket rocket – 0-60mph in 4.8 seconds, 175 BHP, top speed of 138 mph, from a 2.0l engine, which punches well above its weight and looks bloody sexy.

So sexy in fact that when stopped at the lights on the way down Oxford Street, wearing my new Taylor Morris Roll-Right sunglasses I was approached by a stunning model who came over and just started talking to me out of the blue and then gave me her number.  

Behind the wheel: The MIC star is ready to go for a spin

Pocket rocket: Spencer drove the small but perfectly formed car

That doesn't normally happen, it's got to be something to do with the motor I suppose, or the glasses, or both.

Anyway back to the start of the race and there was much revving of engines as we prepared to put our cars on the Eurostar to start the first leg of the five day journey down to Monza – with Johnny Dodge's merry men and women.

Johnny Dodge is a high-end party organiser and this little jaunt is going to visit all the six-star hotels from the Champagne region of France, to Zurich in Switzerland, then on to Lake Como, and then on to the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

The last time I was involved in the Dodge Ball rally I didn’t actually make it off British soil. I was the passenger in a £220K Lamborghini Gallardo and the driver took a corner badly in the wet, flipped the car and wrote the Lambo off completely before we even got to Dover.

Pulling power: The car helped him get a phone number from a model

I was actually asleep at the time and luckily emerged unscathed but it meant that my Dodge Ball race was seriously cut short.

Anyway this year I’m taking no chances with the car and for insurance purposes I have fitted a SmartWitness SVC 1080 camera on the windscreen of the car. 

It’s an HD CCTV camera that you stick to the front windscreen and it records any incident and can be used as evidence of who is at fault if you are in a crash. Pretty important for me as I don’t want to have to pay for a new Caterham if someone totals this.

But as an added bonus is that the quality of the footage is amazing so it’s great for making videos of motor sport races or road trips like this.

So wish me luck and hopefully I will actually get to France and back in one piece and I'll see you all next week.

Lots of love, Spencer.
