A gang of Eastern European men have been jailed for more than 15 years for robbing a John Lewis warehouse.

The four men stole £200,000 worth of electronic goods from the firm's distribution centre in Brackmills, Northampton.

Northampton Crown Court heard how Marcin Bakowski, 30, an ex-employee at John Lewis, wanted revenge after he was sacked for stealing food from the staff canteen.

Marcin Bakowski, 30 (left) led current John Lewis employee Krzysztof Bogszewski, 33 (right) and two others in their £200,000 raid. Bakowski i said to have wanted revenge after he was fired from the store

Piotr Kozlowski, 31 (left) was recruited as the 'muscle' behind the operation and Vitalijs Razadovskis, 26 was to sell the good on. The court heard that the gang was 'clueless' about what to do once with the stolen gear

Bakowski masterminded the raid, during which the gang used a sniper rifle to shoot a CCTV camera to avoid detection and escaped through a makeshift tunnel made from wooden pallets.

The court was told that he hired warehouse porter Krzysztof Bogszewski, 33, for inside information and involved friends Piotr Kozlowski, 31 and Vitalijs Razadovskis, 26.

Judge Michael Fowler said: 'There was a significant degree of planning and organisation' in the burglary.

Bogszewski left the main gate open when he finished his shift and blocked a motion sensor so the men would not be detected.

The gang cut one of the doors open to prevent an alarm from going off and took Apple equipment and Sony and Samsung laptops.

They were detected after police traced the stole Apple items and tracked their mobile phone records.

Judge Fowler said: 'This was an exceptionally valuable burglary.'

The group were sentenced to more than 15 years in total.

The gang had done the groundwork for their raid on John Lewis warehouse in Brackmillls. They made sure the gates were left open for them and they shot at CCTV cameras so they wouldn't be detected

Bakowski was jailed for five years, after pleading guilty to burglary and five charges of theft while he worked at John Lewis.

Bogszewski was sentenced to five and a half years in prison after he was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle following a trial last month.

Kozlowski was jailed for three years for conspiracy to burgle and Razadovski was sentenced to one year and 10 months for handling stolen goods.

Police discovered many people had bought the stolen goods directly from Bakowski - who had used his mobile phone to contact buyers.

All four defendants are likely to be deported once they are released.
