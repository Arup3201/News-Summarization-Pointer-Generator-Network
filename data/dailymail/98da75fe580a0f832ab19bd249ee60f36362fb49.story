Uniformed Secret Service agents arrested an Iowa man outside the White House on Wednesday after he behaved erratically, and later found a hunting rifle and at least 30 rounds of ammunition in the trunk of a car he had parked nearby.

The man had driven all the way from Iowa and approached a Secret Service guard shack when he arrived.

Uniformed Secret Service agents have increased their presence outside the White House since a knife-carrying fence jumper breached both the perimeter and the building on September 19

'DEVASTATING': Acting Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy told the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that procedures are now in place to ensure that a recent spate of presidential security lapses are not repeated

Renae Kapheim told officers that 'someone had told him that he should come to the White House,' a law enforcement official told The New York Times.

'The officers interviewed him there and realized that there needed to be further investigating because something wasn't right.'

The arrest comes on the heels of a congressional hearing Wednesday morning in which Acting Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy apologized for 'devastating' lapses in security that may have put President Barack Obama and his family in physical danger.

In one September 19 incident, a man armed with a pocketknife scaled the White House's outer perimeter fence and sprinted into the mansion through an unlocked door – and was eventually tackled by an off-duty agent. 

And the Secret Service acknowledged this year that a shooter fired at the White House in 2011, and admitted that it wasn't aware of it until staffers in the building found broken glass and damage from a bullet.

Since then, the service has increased the number of uniformed agents who patrol the grounds and the pedestrian mall outside. 

No shots were fired, and Kapheim surrendered his gun to law enforcement

A 30-30 rifle like this one, recovered from a 1998 school shooting  which was recovered after a school shooting in Wisconsin, was found in Kapheim's trunk

Kapheim is a 41-year-old resident of Davenport, Iowa. Police impounded his 2013 Volkswagen and charged him with possession of an illegal firearm, a crime that can bring a 2-10 year prison sentence.

News reports described the weapon as a 30-30 hunting rifle. 

Washington, D.C. residents and visitors must register guns with local police before bringing them into the city, despite the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment which forbids the infringement of gun ownership.

Omar Gonzalez, 42, made it all the way to the East Room of the first floor of the White House on Sept. 19 after he got past five rings of security and sprinted across the 70-yard front lawn – only being apprehended because an off-duty Secret Service agent was present
