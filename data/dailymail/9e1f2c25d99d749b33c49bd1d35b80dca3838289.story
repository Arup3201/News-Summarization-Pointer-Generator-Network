Now share your opinion

Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidic has announced he will leave the club at the end of this season after refusing to hold talks over a new deal.

David Moyes was keen to keep his club captain at Old Trafford but Vidic, who is out of contract this summer, has decided to move on after eight years in Manchester.

The Serbian won 15 trophies after arriving from Russian club Spartak Moscow for £7million in January 2006, going on to become skipper under former manager Sir Alex Ferguson.

In a statement, Vidic said: 'It’s the last year of my contract and I have had eight wonderful years here.

'My time at this great club will always rank as the best years of my career.  I never could have imagined winning 15 trophies and I will certainly never forget that fantastic night in Moscow, memories that will live with me and the fans forever. 

'However, I have decided that I will move on at the end of this season. I want to challenge myself again and try to make the best of myself in the coming years.

'I’m not considering staying in 
England as the only club I ever wanted to play for here is Manchester 
United and I was lucky enough to be part of this Club for so many years.

I’ve got a few options to move on and I will choose the right one for 
me and for my family. 

'I 
am now going to focus all my efforts on playing for Manchester United 
and do the best I can for the team until the end of the season.

I hope 
this stops any further speculation about my future.'

Vidic could be followed out of the club by Rio Ferdinand, whose contract is also expiring this summer. He is considering retiring and becoming a TV pundit.

Moyes recently praised the 32-year-old's contributions this season and confirmed that he was hoping a new deal could be agreed with the former Red Star Belgrade defender.

When asked about Vidic's contract situation, Moyes said: 'I didn’t know about Vida’s contract, I
 have not looked into it yet. I am sure the chief executive and the club
 will be doing that.'

'He’s not old. He is a really top centre-half. He’s the best I have ever worked with, that’s for sure.'

Vidic's decision will make a new central defender a priority for Moyes this summer, particularly with 35-year-old Rio Ferdinand also out of contract at the end of June.

Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Jonny Evans are Moyes' other options but, after promising more big-moneys signings after the arrival of Juan Mata from Chelsea last month, the former Everton boss will be hopeful of bringing in a suitable replacement when the transfer window reopens.

Vidic has already attracted the attention
 of free-spending Monaco in France and Roberto Mancini's Galatasaray, 
while Serie A trio Inter Milan, AC Milan and Juventus are all reported 
to be keen on signing him.

Struggling: Vidic has been unable to stop United's disappointing form under Moyes this season

Despite making only 19 league appearances last season after struggling to recover from a serious knee injury, Vidic captained United to their 20th league title in Ferguson's final season in charge at Old Trafford.

Vidic has so far made 284 appearances for United, scoring 19 goals in all competitions and lifting five Premier League titles, one Champions League trophy, three League Cups, five Community Shields and one FIFA Club World Cup.

The ex-Spartak defender has also been honoured for his individual performances, winning the Premier League Player of the Year award in 2008-09 and 2010-11.

He is available to face Fulham on Sunday after serving a three-match ban following his red card in the defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last month.
