Celebrity: Stoned Fox may be a badly stuffed piece of taxidermy but that hasn't stopped him finding fame

It started with a bid. Now a taxidermied fox has become 'the winner of the internet' after becoming a popular meme in Russia.

The stuffed creature, known as Stoned Fox because of his 'drug-addicted' look, has found favour with internet users, who have taken to Photoshop and let their imaginations run wild.

Digital trickery has seen Stoned Fox take his place all over history, from posing with US president Barack Obama to wartime conferences with Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill, and a Leonardo Da Vinci painting to the edge of the stratosphere, just like Felix Baumgartner.

The fox was the creation of Welsh artist Adele Morse, based in Dalston, east London.

She experimented with stuffing the fox, which died of natural causes, and put the finished item on eBay.

A bidding war broke out and Ms Morse 
realised the fox had gained a Russian fanbase when she started getting 
messages through the auction site showing off the weird and wonderful settings he had been Photoshopped in.

Now Ms Morse and the fox, borrowed from its new owner, are setting out on tour.

The pair will be visiting St Petersburg in a fortnight, according to the Russian Ministry of Culture.

She plans to show documentaries she

Stoned Fox meme, and invited fans to contribute their own.

Ms Morse will also meet journalists and fans to tell them about how Stoned Fox came to exist.

The eBay auction which sparked the craze started bidding at £12.

Ms Morse described the item as: 'a young Red Fox made to look as though it is a human.

'I usually practice traditional taxidermy but I decided to try something a little different.

'He is not perfect but he does have a lot of character.

'He can sit on a cabinet, chair, shelf, or plinth.'

The promise of 'character' and his versatility in positioning obviously sparked something in the minds of internet users.

A bidding war ensued after DJ Space Dimension Controller posted the link on his Facebook page.

He said: 'If someone can be bothered to keep 
bidding on this, and win it, i will personally turn up to your house and
 play a live set and send you a signed copy of the album, with a picture
 of me and this fox totally vibin' out.'

A music promoter from Manchester, Mike Boorman, beat other bidders to the taxidermied creature with a final bid of £330.

The
 DJ, real name Jack Hamill, was good to his word and did a set in the 
presence of the fox and Mr Boorman at Dance Tunnel in Dalston last month.

Shortly
 after Mr Boorman claimed his prize, Ms Morse began to receive messages 
via eBay telling her that the stuffed animal was gaining quite a 
following in Russia.

By the end of 2012, Stoned Fox was declared 'the winner of the internet' by Russia's Metro Newspaper - quite a feat in the same year that Gangnam Style dominated the net.

Ms Morse told WalesOnline: 'I asked what it was about the fox that they liked and he told me that the fox looks a bit sad and drunk and that’s how Russians feel.

'His plastic eyes give him a glazed look and they identify with it, they think it symbolises the nation.'

The fox's stance apparently lends itself well to Photoshop-meddling, left, while Anna Veduta, press secretary to Russian activist Alexei Navalny, sported him on a T-shirt
