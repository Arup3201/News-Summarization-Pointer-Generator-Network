Driver: Businessman Darren Jarvis, pictured arriving at Cardiff Crown Court, is charged with causing death by dangerous driving after a road traffic accident which left Jacek Stawski & Lee Williams dead

A businessman whose car number plate read 'Who's bad' lost control on a country lane while showing off his sports car at 100mph and killed two married fathers, a court has heard.

Property developer Darren Jarvis, 42, was driving friend Lee Williams in his white turbo-charged Nissan Skyline sports car when he lost control.

Cardiff Crown Court heard Jarvis span across the road and crashed into a Citroen Xsara driven by Jacek Stawski.

Mr Williams, 40, and 38-year-old Mr Stawksi - both married with two children - were killed 'almost instantly' in the horror smash in Cwmbach, south Wales, in August last year.

But Mr Stawski's four-year-old-son Thomas miraculously survived in the back seat of the family car.

Prosecutor Nicholas Jones said Jarvis was speeding at 100mph on a winding road to show off in the Â£30,000 3.8 litre turbo sports car.

He said that although the car's number plate was WHO6 BAD, a screw had been put through the number six to make the registration read 'Who's bad' from a distance.

Mr Jones told the court: 'Jarvis and his passenger Mr Williams were at the head of a line of traffic - there was no one in front of them.

'Jarvis put his foot down and accelerated hard.

'Witnesses behind them in cars heard the sound of the exhaust and saw dust and gravel being kicked up by the wheels.

'As he came around the bend he started to lose control and the nearside wheels hit the kerb and went onto the grass verge for some distance until the car started to spin.

Tragic: Lee Williams, who was a passenger in Darren Jarvis's car when it crashed was killed almost instantly

Victim: Father of two Jacek Stawski (pictured) was in another car that was hit head on in the collision. He was also killed in the crash

'A woman was coming the other way and she swerved and managed to avoid the car somehow as it came across the road.

'Mr Stawski behind her was not so lucky.'

Witnesses said Jarvis was 'frantically' trying to wrestle back control of the speeding car as he span into the oncoming traffic.

Mr Stawski was driving well below the 60mph speed limit with son Thomas in the back seat when his family saloon was hit 'broadside' by the spinning sports car.

Mr Jones said: 'The Citroen had almost stopped when the crash occurred.

'It was struck with such great force to the front that it was knocked backwards and spun 180 degrees.

'Both Mr Williams and Mr Stawski suffered the full impact of the collision and were declared dead within minutes of the paramedics arriving.'

Personalised: The sports car driven by Jarvis had the number plate 'WHO6 BAD'

Father-of-two Jarvis, of Radyr, Cardiff, was airlifted to hospital.

He was treated for broken ribs, internal bleeding and spinal injuries and released after five days in hospital.

When interviewed by police he said he couldn't remember anything.

Mr Jones told the jury: 'There seems to be two issues Jarvis relies on.

Sports car: Mr Jarvis was driving a Nissan Skyline, similar to the car pictured

'First that he may have had some sort of fit or seizure during the crash, and second that the crash speed was considerably lower than the 100 mph.

'Our case is that he put his foot down as fast as he could and probably to show off to the passenger in his car.

'This was a case of deliberate acceleration and dangerous driving.'

Jarvis denies two charges of causing death by dangerous driving.

Nissan claims that the top speed of the 3.8litre Skyline is 193mph.

The trial continues.
