Tottenham have completed the signing of Sporting Lisbon's Eric Dier for £4million.

The north London side have seen off interest from Newcastle and West Ham to secure a five-year deal for the Englishman as Mauricio Pochettino adds more strength to a back-line that conceded 51 times last season.

Dier, speaking to Tottenham's official website, has revealed his delight at sealing a move to White Hart Lane ahead of the new season: 'I am really excited to be joining such a big club in the Premier League.

Dier's father Jeremy was a professional tennis player during his earlier years and even competed at Wimbledon.

Jeremy 's highest ranking during his competitive tennis career was 344 - which came in January 1982.

'It has always been my ambition to come back to England and play in the Premier League so I am really happy to be back.

'I want to impress the manager and keep the fans happy. I want to do as well as possible for the club.

'The Premier League is the biggest league in the world. I was watching a lot of Tottenham during my time in Portugal.

'The reason I moved to Portugal was nothing to do with football - it was because of my family.

'We moved there when I was six, I got picked up by Sporting when I was eight and I went through their youth system, all the way to the first team.

'It is kind of a strange background and everyone seems surprised by it. But it just happened that way really.

'At the beginning it was hard because I didn't really speak the language. I was seen as a bit of an outsider.

'But after I picked up the language when I was 12 or 13, it was really easy. I don't think they saw me as English - they pretty much saw me like one of their own.

'I enjoy watching Tottenham play because of their attacking style. I want to adapt quickly to the Premier League and do as best I can.'

The 20-year-old was born in Cheltenham but moved to Portugal with his family when he was seven. He was picked up by Sporting scouts and has advanced through their academy to break into their first team.

Sporting's academy is renowned for 
producing top quality youngsters, and Dier is in good company with 
Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Figo as fellow graduates.

A versatile defensive player, he can also provide cover at right back and in defensive midfield and becomes Spurs' third signing of the summer after Michael Vorm and Ben Davies from Swansea.

A club statement said: 'We are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement with Sporting Lisbon for the transfer of Eric Dier, subject to a medical.

In the past Dier has been reported as saying: 'Ultimately, I want to test myself against the best and the Premier League is where I dream about playing.'
