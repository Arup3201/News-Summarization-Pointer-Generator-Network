A few came to praise the new arrivals, others to bury them under disapproval for the whole notion of anyone other than the manager - even an interim caretaker serving his notice - picking the team.

On a day when Rangers fans had plenty to complain about, they at least managed to cheer one of the on-loan Newcastle United players shoehorned into their starting XI.

And perhaps hope, amid the wreckage of their 2-1 Scottish Cup defeat at home to Raith Rovers, that Haris Vuckic’s goal-scoring debut is a sign of what to expect, once the rest of his mates are in harness. 

Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle United, celebrates scoring on his debut for Rangers

Of the five United men sent on loan to Rangers, only centre-half Remie Streete and winger Vuckic were deemed fit enough to play on Sunday; the command and control structure at Rangers does not, as yet, force the manager to field players medically unable to run the length of themselves.

Streete didn’t even make it until half-time before adding himself to the list of the injured, so the 20-year-old didn’t have much of a chance to impress.

Although the sight of him limping off after being outmuscled by Dale Carrick - not a big man - after 43 minutes might raise some questions over his ability to cope with the physical side of first-team football.

While on the pitch, he made one perfectly-time challenge to prevent a Raith counter-attack. And, erm, that was about it.

Vuckic, a 22-year-old full international for Slovenia, had played a handful of first-team games on loan spells at Cardiff Cardiff City and then Rotherham United. On paper, he looked the best of the five new arrivals.

Switching wings playing through the middle, Vuckic looked to have a decent touch and reasonable movement, although his first real chance to shine saw him run straight into the venerable Dougie Hill, a Rovers stalwart who has seen off more potent threats than him in his time.

Caught in possession and wasteful on occasion, he showed the potential - and might have scored had a looping header and goalmouth scramble fallen differently just before half-time.

Then, after looking a little lost as Raith took the lead and the home fans grew increasingly restless, Vuckic peeled away to receive a Kyle Hutton pass and score with superb low left-footed strike. It wasn’t his fault that his new team-mates couldn’t even hang on for a replay.

Actually, having played in front of a mostly empty stadium in a rank rotten performance, do you think the player himself might be having second thoughts about this move?
