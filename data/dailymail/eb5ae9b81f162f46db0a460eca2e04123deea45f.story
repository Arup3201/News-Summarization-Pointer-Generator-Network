Captain Cook may not have been the first European to settle in Australia after all.

A 16th-century-style Portuguese cannon, that was discovered by a 13-year-old boy off a remote beach in the Northern Territory in 2010, has reignited the debate over who first arrived in the country.

Research has shown the lead that the cannon is made from is linked to an ancient Spanish mine, meaning the historic artifact could have arrived in Australia before Lieutenant James Cook stepped off HMS Endeavour in 1770.

The Portuguese may have even brought the swivel gun to the country before the Dutch made the first official European sighting of Australia in early 1606.

Teenager Christopher Doukas unearthed the historic swivel gun at Dundee Beach, about 120km southwest of Darwin, four years ago, when tides dipped to exceptional lows in January 2010 meaning he could walk out a long way from shore.

He saw the 107cm-long gun, an anti-personnel light artillery piece, poking out of mud, dug it out with his father and took it back to his home.

Portugal occupied Timor from 1515 until 1975 and it has long been hotly debated whether Portuguese explorers made it all the way to Australia, about 700km away.

Research by the University of Melbourne has shown that the lead in the cannon most closely resembled metal found at the ancient Coto Laizquez mine in the Andalusia region in Spain's south.

The historians compared lead in the cannon to ore samples obtained from 2000 European sources and ruled out the theory that the gun was a later Asian copy of the Portuguese swivel.

A Darwin-based heritage group, Past Masters, said yesterday that the findings showed the lead in the gun was mined on the Spanish Iberian Peninsula.

'It is simply likely therefore that the gun is of similar origin. European origin shouldn't be discounted just because it is obvious.

'This truly is the smoking gun of the Portuguese discovery of northern Australia,' a spokesman for the group, Mike Owens, told The Times.  

Last year, Australian scientist Tim Stone - also a member of the Past Masters - said the find will help rewrite the nation's history.

'The cannon is one of the most significant historical artifacts ever found in northern Australia,' he said.

However, the man who tested the lead - Matt Cupper, of the University of Melbourne - said that even if it was from the Spanish mine, it remained a possibility that the lead could have been recycled from another object and used to make the gun in Asia.

'Lead objects were frequently melted down and recast, so the gun could have been manufactured elsewhere,' he said.

The cannon went on display in Darwin this week.

Mr Doukas claimed he and his father knew that cannon was 'old' when he found it, back in 2010.

'As soon as we got it back into Darwin my dad got an angle grinder and nicked a little bit of it. We saw it was bronze, so we knew it was old,' he told the Australian Geographic.

The cannon isn't the first artifact that has suggested Australia might need to rewrite its history books.

Ancient African kingdom Kilwa coins, believed to date from about 1100, came to be discovered on the Wessels Islands off the Northern Territory in 1944 and have long posed questions about foreign visits to far off Australian shores.

Aboriginal Australians are thought to have first arrived on the Australian mainland by boat from the Malay Archipelago between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago.

Dieppe Maps, 16th-century French world maps which depict a large land mass between Indonesia and Antarctica, have led some to believe that the French then became the first Europeans to discover Australia in the 1500s.

French navigator Binot Paulmier de Gonneville claimed to have landed at 'east of the Cape of Good Hope' in 1504, after being blown off course. But the place that he reached, which some believed to be Australia, has now been proven to be Brazil.

There have also been persistent theories that Portuguese navigators reached Australia between 1521 and 1524, in part because of the Dieppe maps which are thought to be based on Portuguese charts.

A number of relics and remains - including the cannon - have been interpreted as evidence that the Portuguese reached Australia first.

What we know for certain, is that Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon made the first documented European landing on the Australian continent in 1606, at Cape York Peninsula.

The first Englishman to land on the Australian mainland was William Dampier, a former pirate. He reached the northwest coast, near King Sound, On 5 January 1688 after his ship the Cygnet, a small trading vessel, was beached.

Then, in 1770, Captain Cook made the first European landing on Australia's east coast.

Great Britain thereby became the first European power to officially claim any area on the Australian mainland.
