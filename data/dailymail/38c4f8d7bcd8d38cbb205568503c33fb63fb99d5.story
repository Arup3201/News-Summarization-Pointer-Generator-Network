It has stood on Chicago's historic South Prairie Avenue since 1888, but on Tuesday the Harriet Rees Mansion began a two-day trek just one block north, or 600 feet away.

Making way for a new university basketball arena, the mansion was moved atop a huge array of automated dollies, crawling and inching at one-half-foot per second on 250 wheels.

Weighing more than 1,000 tons, the three-story brick house is 95-feet long, 25-feet wide and 72-feet wide and one of the last residential remnants of the Gilded Age in the Windy City.

Inching: Crews watch as the Harriet Rees House, a three-story, Chicago mansion built in 1888, is moved slowly to a new location from the historic Prairie Avenue to make room for redevelopment

The house was encased in a steel frame and raised onto 32 massive motorized dollies for the 600-foot move

'The house, including all the equipment and the beams, this weighs around 1,050 tons,' said Peter Kuhn, senior executive project manager at Bulley & Andrews to DNAINFO.

'The project will take three days to move the building from from its original location to its relocation site.

'You don't see houses move like this every day.'

Since 2002, the Harriet Rees House has been the last mansion left standing on South Prairie Avenue and its move has been eagerly anticipated by local residents.

The home was built for the widow of a real estate innovator, and stood near homes built by George Pullman and Marshall Field. 

Crews on Tuesday began slowly moving the three-story, 762-ton Harriet Rees House one block to make way for redevelopment of the area near Chicago's convention center

The house was encased in a steel frame and raised onto 32 massive motorized dollies for the 600-foot move. With a top speed of about one half foot per second, the move is expected to take two days

'This is very exciting,' said Linda Jones, 45, to DNAINFO. 'I've never seen anything like this done before. I wish I'd seen how they got the house on the beams.'

Moving the home has not been an easy engineering task.

'We excavated around the house. We put in three main beams which run the length of the house. Then we put a series of crossbeams on top of those that run the width of the house,' said Kuhn to NBC Chicago.

'After that we jacked it up approximately 8 feet. Now it is on a set of 29 dollies, each of which have eight wheels on it.'

William Tyre, executive director and curator of Glessner House Museum and author of 'Chicago's Historic Prairie Avenue said the move was costing millions.

'When his house was built in 1888 the cost was $18,000,' said Bill Tyre, executive director of the Glassner House to ABC Chicago. 'In 2014 they are spending $6,000,000 to move the house, plus almost $2,000,000 for the land it's being moved to.'

House: The home was the last structure in the block along Chicago's historic Prairie Avenue and is where the city plans a hotel and 10,000-seat arena

Avenue: South Prairie Avenue was home to some of Chicago’s wealthiest people and has slowly decayed over the years
