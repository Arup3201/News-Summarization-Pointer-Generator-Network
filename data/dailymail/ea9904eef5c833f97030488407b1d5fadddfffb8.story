Well that's it from me here. Andy Murray cruises through in style at Queen's as his grasscourt season under the coaching of Amelie Mauresmo begins in style.

Thanks for following and cheerio.

'The ideal 86-minute match for Murray to kick off his grass-court season in terms of rhythm. Impressive performance from the Wimbledon champion who was on top throughout.

'His next match will likely be much trickier against Czech Radek Stepanek, who likes to serve and volley and charge forward at any opportunity.'

Serving for the match, Murray begins by delivering an ace out wide, before edging 30-0 head.

A crosscourt forehand winner into the corner brings up three match points, but Mathieu delays the seemingly inevitable before Murray serves out to 15 to record a comfortable victory

Murray's being made to wait, but Mathieu twice blows the chance to serve out a hold at advantage.

Another ace from the Frenchman gives him advantage, before an excellently judged drop shot from the Frenchman is followed by a perfect baseline lob to hold out in style.

And the heat is on now for Mathieu. Murray edges 0-30 in front but Mathieu fights back, including an ace out wide to level.

Murray regains momentum to move into match point, but can only fire into the net to bring up deuce.

Mathieu attempts to stay in a rally with a blind lob played between his legs, but the ball just bounces out and Murray easily serves out thereafter to leave Mathieu serving to stay in the match.

Mathieu goes against the script to move 0-30 in front after punishing the Murray second serve. Murray gets his first serve back into gear to hit a wide ace, but a double fault from the Brit gives the Frenchman two break points.

The Scot survives the first as Mathieu can only return a serve way off court, while a 132mph serve is un-returnable and brings up deuce. Well saved, Andy.

While Mathieu can't get to the Murray serve, the Scot threatens to break again as he gains two break points.

Mathieu survives the first by forcing an error from the British No. 1, but an error from the Frenchman enables Murray to get the break.Â 

Oh Goran, always breaking British hearts. I still haven't forgiven him for beating Tim Henman in the 2001 Wimbledon semi-final.

Meanwhile, Murray's ears must be burning from the debate, as he blitzes through another service hold to love - although this isn't quite 38 seconds.

'Currently some debate as to whether that 38-second hold from Murray in the second game of this set is one of, if not the fastest game ever.

'I certainly can't recall seeing a quicker game, although one expert reckons Goran Ivanisevic held serve in 35 seconds against Pete Sampras in the 1998 Wimbledon final.'

Astonishing point. Murray and Mathieu exchange in a battle involving net shots and lobs, but the Scot comes out the loser as he is left eating the grass at Queen's desperately trying to return a cross court return.

It's the boost the Frenchman needs, as he serves out with ease.

Straight forward hold for Murray to 30. Mathieu has troubled the Scot at times but cannot do it often enough to really leave the British No.1 in any bother.

Mathieu unearths the box of tricks again with a disguised drop shot but follows up with a return out wide to reset deuce.

A Murray backhand to the baseline sees Mathieu powerfully fire into the net but at break point Murray can't see the game out as the Frenchman gradually takes control of a rally which ends with another delicate drop shot out of the Scot's reach.

It's as close as Murray gets to breaking, as Mathieu takes the next two points to keep this set on serve.

Mathieu tries the quick service game tactic himself as he too eases 30-0 but Murray soon draws level as the Frenchman double faults.

Murray takes the next point to gain a break point, but Murray is left fooled by a disguised serve as Mathieu goes down the T to grab an ace and deuce.

Wow - in 38 seconds Murray holds! Two aces and two poor returns from Mathieu see that service game done and dusted.

Have we ever seen a service game end as quick as that?

Murray challenges a call out to his shot out wide without success, falling 30-15 behind, before a superb forehand baseline winner from Mathieu sees him edge closer to a hold.

Murray attacks the net with purpose to cushion a volley winner for 40-30 but Mathieu then leaves Murray rooted to the spot firing another winner to hold.

'Very comfortable first set for Murray after Mathieu threw away the break in the opening game. The Brit strong on serve and moving well.

'If Murray comes through, he'll take on wily Czech veteran Radek Stepanek who has just defeated Aussie bad boy Bernard Tomic in two tiebreak sets.'

The match might be slipping away from Mathieu, and his feet are following as he again loses his balance trying to return a Murray serve for 15-0.

The Scot meanwhile moves into two set points with ease. Mathieu hits a neat backhand winner to the baseline but can only return wide on the next point as Murray takes the first set.

Mathieu takes advantage before Murray pegs back for a second deuce, before the Frenchman gradually sneaks to the net to hit a simple winner before holding out.

But how long for? Murray now serves for the set.

Mathieu is serving to stay in the set and is soon under pressure at 0-30 down, only to respond be winning the next two points for 30-30.

Murray attacks a second serve with the backhand, and it leads to Mathieu returning into the net to bring up set point, one which Mathieu holds out to bring up deuce.

Fortune favours the Frenchman as he clips the net cord leaving Murray helpless to respond at 15-15, but Murray soon presses on, holding out to 15 with a delicate lob.

As Murray runs side-to-side to stay in a rally, Mathieu puts him out of his misery with a half volley, only for Murray to respond on the next point with a winner.

Deuce two sees Mathieu edge ahead again before he sends an ace out wide to hold.

And Mathieu is staring down the barrel again. An attempted forehand winner down the line is narrowly out for 15-30 but the Frenchman responds with an ace down the T.

A Murray return sees Mathieu cushion a volley over the net, but a double fault from the Frenchman brings up deuce.

Blink and you'll miss it. At 15-15, Murray moves 30-15 ahead before rifling another wide ace and forcing an instant error out of Mathieu on the next point to see out his serve.

'Solid start from Murray, already showing the deft touch which makes his game so strong on grass.

'Murray hasn't lost on grass since the defeat to Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final in 2012, and a win today would be his 19th consecutive win on the surface.'

Murray is still finding his feet on grass, making a few basic unforced errors. Mathieu's having a few issues himself as he is slipping all over the place but manages to hold his serve.

And that's the last Mathieu sees of Murray's service game, as the Scot takes advantage before serving an ace out wide to hold.

Bold from Mathieu, who turns up the heat with a stunning lobbed topspin volley... only to be met by a Murray ace for 30-15.

Murray then hits a rather simple forehand into the net before he returns wide to hand Mathieu break point. It's survived though as the Frenchman rifles into the net. Deuce.

More carnage on the way for Mathieu who double faults for 0-30, before we finally see some skill from the Frenchman who hits a neat cross court backhand winner.

Mathieu then levels at 30-30, before somehow hitting a winner at the net despite slipping while running to get there. Impressive.

The recovery is complete as Murray's attempted lob is met by a neat drop shot which the Scot just cannot reach.

Murray also easily skates 40-0 ahead, but he too shows an inability to serve out to love as Mathieu ends an eight-point losing run to pull a point back. Murray's in no mood to mess about too much though as he serves out.

The Mathieu capitulation is complete as Murray wins five points in a row to break serve straight away. The Mauresmo factor? Probably not, and the French woman shows barely flicker of emotion courtside.

Away we go then, it's Murray's first match in the UK since winning Wimbledon last year and he faces Paul-Henri Mathieu's serve to begin his Queen's Club title defence.

It's certainly not an easy start as the Frenchman shows no sign of nerves to skate into a 40-0 lead.

But after firing into the net and being beaten by a cross court winner, Mathieu is soon pegged back to 40-30, before he smashes an overhead shot straight into the net. Deuce we go - when it really should have been a straight forward hold.

'It feels like the beginning of a new era here at Queen's as Amelie Mauresmo takes her seat in Andy Murray's courtside box.

'It may only be an "era" which lasts for four weeks, though, as the groundbreaking appointment is only initially for the grass court season as both parties figure out whether it can work long-term.'

Yes, Andy Murray is back on these shores and is now out on court to defend his Queen's Club crown which he won last year (it wasn't just Wimbledon folks).

All the second round action against Paul Henri-Mathieu will be coming up very soon.
