One man adores food so much that he spends nearly all of his money on it, leaving him unable to afford any furniture for his home.

Cooking instructor Ron Maestri explains how he's managed to save every penny for his culinary pleasures on tonight's episode of TLC's Extreme Cheapskates.

'I think people can enjoy a foodie lifestyle on a cheap budget. Every dollar we spend on anything other than food is a waste,' he says.

'I'm a foodie. I love everything to do with food,' he adds.

After cooking up a plate of scrambled eggs in his kitchen, Mr Maestri is seen dining in an empty living room, where he spreads a tablecloth on the floor.

'I got the apartment a few years ago. I don't see the need to spend money on furniture. I'm a floor guy. I sit on the floor, and it's very comfortable,' he insists.

Pot of gold: Mr Maestri works at a cookware company and many manufacturers send him free samples

'It's just tossing money into the receptacle, that's what I think of furniture,' he adds.

Mr Maestri says one of the perks of working at a cookware company that gives frequent product demonstrations is that many manufacturers send him free samples.

Perhaps the ultimate testament to his thriftiness is the makeshift bed where he sleeps, which he constructed himself from two-by-fours and styrofoam peanuts.

Cover up: He uses a tablecloth as a budget-friendly alternative to sheets and a comforter 

Closet confession: Mr Maestri owns only three shirts and two pairs of shorts

'I just take all the peanuts, throw them in there, and then I cover it up with bubble wrap and then this is a table cloth, and it makes a perfect bed,' he says.

While the show's narrator notes that the average cost to furnish a one-bedroom house is about $2,000, and clothing expenses for a single professional can reach $400 a year, Mr Maestri spends a total of $20 on both his home and his wardrobe.

'One, two, three shirts and two pairs of shorts and that's it,' he says, enthusiastically adding: 'And by the way, I own no underwear and no socks.'

Extreme Cheapskates airs Wednesdays on TLC at 9pm ET.
