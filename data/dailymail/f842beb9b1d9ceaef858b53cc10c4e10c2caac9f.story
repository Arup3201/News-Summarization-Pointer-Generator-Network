A couple who unearthed a time capsule dated 1978 hidden away in their wall have found the man who left in there when he was just 12 years old.

Greg Sandoval and his partner were renovating their house in Fontana, California, when they pulled away a wall panel to find a plastic bag hidden there more than 36 years ago.

The package contained a note, a few coins, a newspaper cutting and a McDonald's scratch card - and was signed by seventh-grader Robert Wright.

Times a-changing: Robert Wright, shown left as a schoolboy, hid a time capsule in the wall of his home in Fontana, California, when he was 12. Now he is aged 49 (right), the capsule has been rediscovered

'Hello whoever finds this': The 12-year-old Wright explained in the note that his dad's DIY was giving him the chance to hide the note away. He also provided 'proof' of the date

The note read: 'Hello to whoever finds this. My name is Robert Wright. Today my dad is putting up paneling.

'Today is November 18th, 1978, 15 till 12:00 noon. I'm 12 years old and a student at Fontana JR. High, 7th grade.

'I am 5'3, blond hair, hazel eyes. Here is proof of the date. Robert Wright.'

At first, Sandoval had no idea who Wright really was - and his own searches came to nothing.

But after telling his story to local news station ABC7, news the capsule had been found made it across the country to the boy - now grown into a 49-year-old man.

Wright, who lives in Austin, Texas, said he was inundated with messages after the local news story - and realized the boy in question must have been his schoolboy self.

He told ABC News: 'I watched the video link and was like, ‘Oh my gosh. This is me. I am that Robert Wright.'

Recalling the moment he stashed away the package, he said: 'I wrote the note and it wasn’t enough and I needed proof of the date so I tore off a newspaper.

'I don’t have any recollection of the McDonald’s ticket - my guess is I just ran off into my room and grabbed whatever I could find with the date on it and just stuck it in the baggy and threw it in the wall.'
