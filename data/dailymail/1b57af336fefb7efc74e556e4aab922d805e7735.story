A South Carolina man who was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the murder of his mother and stepfather — who were found wrapped in plastic in his basement — has been apprehended a day after he escaped from a mental hospital, officials said Friday.

Jason Mark Carter, 39, was picked up at a hotel in Fairview, Tennessee, after police tracked his cell phone pings - the technology that marks the location of your last signal.

His aunt, Karin Thorne, said she was relieved.

'If he's not on his meds, he could injure someone,' she told NBC.

Jason Mark Carter, who was committed to a mental institution following the 2006 murder of his mother and stepfather, escaped from the Craft Farrow State Hospital in Columbia, South Carolina, on Thursday morning. He was tracked down by police on Friday evening at a hotel in Tennessee

It's unclear how he escaped from the Craft Farrow State Hospital in Columbia, S.C., on Thursday morning but police believe he stole a 1991 Chevy van and later somehow purchased a Chevy Lumina.

Carter was charged with murdering his stepfather and mother in Seneca in March 2006.

The decomposing bodies Kevin and Deborah Ann Perkins were found by police wrapped in plastic in the basement of the family's home.

They had been shot in the head with a .22 caliber handgun.

Officers at the time said Carter ate and slept with in the same room as the bodies for three days.

However, due to mental health issues, he was deemed not fit to stand trial.

Instead he was involuntarily committed to an institution rather than being convicted.

On Thursday morning, police in Oconee
 County confirmed Carter escaped from a mental health facility in 
Northeast Richland County.

The South Carolina Department of Mental Health also confirmed the disappearance.

He was reported to have been working in a supply business in the hospital's grounds when he made the escape.

Police said an investigation has been launched to determine how the man got away.

The car Carter stole was a white Chevrolet van from 1991, which was reported missing from the facility not long after his disappearance. 

In court, Carter's lawyer said he had no recollection of the crimes, according to WISTV.

During the trial, mental health experts said that, with the correct medication, Carter's mental health issues could be controlled.

Carter's grandfather, B.S. Pope, tried to convince the court that Carter was crazy like a fox and should stand trial for murder.
