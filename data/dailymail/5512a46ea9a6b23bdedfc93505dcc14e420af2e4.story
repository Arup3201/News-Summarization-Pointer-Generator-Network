Ed Miliband likes to boast that he is on the side of struggling families – while David Cameron’s  Conservatives are the ‘party of millionaires’.

But the Labour leader was embarrassed last night after it emerged that one of his most senior advisers is locked in a bitter row with conservationists over his plans to demolish his ‘rather ordinary’ £8.5 million house and rebuild it as a mock- Jacobean mansion.

Andrew Rosenfeld has even bought the house next door for £6.2 million so that he has somewhere to live while the work is carried out.

'Totally alien': Andrew Rosenfeld plans to demolish his £8.5million North London house (pictured)

The property tycoon has been entrusted
by Mr Miliband with ‘widening the base’ of Labour supporters and 
winning the battleground marginal seats that will decide the next 
Election.

Now the 
multi-millionaire, who donated almost £500,000 to the party this year, 
has infuriated his North London neighbours by applying to erect a 
seven-bedroom house, complete with a gym, gallery, circular fountain and
garden pavilion, on the site of his current home.

Locals accuse Mr 
Rosenfeld of trying to make a ‘quick buck’ by imposing  a ‘totally 
alien’ design that would destroy the character of the area. 

The
row is embarrassing for Mr Miliband, who has made a series  of attacks 
on the destructive behaviour of ‘predator’ capitalists.

Mr
Rosenfeld, 50, a married father of four, returned to London last year 
after spending five years as a tax exile in Switzerland – during which 
time he added to his estimated £100 million fortune by making  a 
£21 million profit on a Geneva mansion. The businessman then bought the 
two properties within a conservation area in London’s wealthy Highgate 
for a total of £14.7 million.  

Hypocritical: Ed Miliband says he is on the side of struggling families yet one of his most senior advisers, Andrew Rosenfeld (right) wants to demolish his £8.5million house and rebuild it as a mock-Jacobean mansion

Mr Rosenfeld embarked on the redevelopment after an architect’s report concluded that the £8.5 million house was ‘a rather ordinary example of a late Victorian house, probably built on a limited budget’.

Neighbours, including Labour’s former London Deputy Mayor Nicky Gavron, have objected to the council. ‘The proposals are out of scale and character with this street within the conservation area and would be seriously detrimental  to its character,’ said Ms Gavron.

Another neighbour, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ‘We think he will spend as much again  on the house, £8 million, and sell  it for between £20 million and £25 million, giving him a profit of between £5 million and £9 million – which makes his donation to Labour seem like quite small beer. But at  what cost to our local heritage?’

Mr Rosenfeld has angered his neighbours with his plans to build a seven-bedroom house with a gym, gallery, circular fountain and garden pavillion

In his response to the complaints, Mr Rosenfeld has written in a letter to the council: ‘There seems to be a suggestion or implication from some quarters that we have not engaged in proper consultation nor responded to comments and observations made by those with whom we have spoken and represented. We commenced the consultation process around a year ago.

‘What we have sought to do is take what we consider the best aspects in the conservation area and apply a level of quality and detailing that is rarely achieved.’ Mr Rosenfeld declined to comment.
