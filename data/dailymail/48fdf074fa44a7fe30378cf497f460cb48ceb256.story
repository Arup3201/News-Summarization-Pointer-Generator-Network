Plastic microbeads found in facial scrubs and toothpastes could be gone within two years.

The NSW government has called for all microbeads to be removed from personal care products sold in Australia by 2016.

During the release of a health review into Sydney Harbour, New South Wales Environment Minister Rob Stokes urged the beauty and personal care industry to phase out the pollutants.

The microbeads are small enough to bypass the sewerage system and pose a danger to seabirds and sealife who confuse the beads for food.

'These microplastics are already having an impact on our marine environment,' Mr Stokes said.

The call came from State Environment Minister Rob Stokes when he presented a health report into the harbour

'We need to address this looming environmental issue...we know it has potential health concerns.'

The Sydney Institute of Marine Science identified microplastics and flame retardants as an 'emerging contaminant' but said its effect on the harbour had not been assessed.

'Studies that identified potential threats from emerging contaminants, quantified stormwater impacts on ecosystem function and identified safe and efficient means for restoring or remediating historically polluted sediments would be immediately useful to harbour management,' it said.

The team behind the report found microbeads at the bottom of the harbour for the first time, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.

These particles are appearing in higher levels than initially thought by the researchers.

An industry working group will convene in the coming weeks with the aim of voluntarily phasing out the pollutant, following similar actions overseas.

The microbeads have been banned from products in the United States in the state of New York, and it is a growing concern in the United Kingdom.

When ingested by tuna, mussels, crabs and other fish, they could pass on the potentially harmful chemicals to humans.

The report also identified the impacts of urban run-offf and storm water drains also needed to be examined.
