Two Austrian sisters have disappeared from their home in Vienna in what authorities fear could be the latest case of teenagers going to fight for ISIS in Syria.

The girls, named only as Violetta, 17, and Viktoria, 16, due to Austrian privacy laws, have not been seen since 11pm on Saturday, and their mother fears they could have gone abroad to join Islamists.

If her fears are correct, then the girls will follow in the footsteps of Samra Kesinovic, 17, and her friend Sabina Selimovic, 15, who became poster girls for jihad after going to Syria in April.

Setaniye, the mother of the latest pair to vanish, said the girls' father died last year from cancer and they had turned to religion in order to cope.

She added: 'The two seemed to have been taking some comfort from religion but I was worried lately that they appeared to be getting a bit extreme. 

'They were acting a bit strange but as a single mum I was always so busy perhaps I didn't pay as much attention as I should.

'I last saw them at the weekend when they said they were going to the shops and they never came back. They should only have been gone a few minutes but when an hour had gone past I worried, and when I looked there was no sign of them.'

She said that her initial concerns turned into panic when she checked the girls' rooms and found the both of them had taken their passports.

The 46-year-old mother added: 'Going back over their behaviour now over the last few weeks I'm convinced and terrified that they may have travelled to Syria to join ISIS.'

If the sisters have travelled to Syria, then they will follow in the footsteps of friend Sabina Selimovic, 15 (pictured), and Samra Kesinovic, 17, who also fled Vienna earlier this year

Fellow teenagers Samra and Sabina disappeared in April, leaving notes for their parents which read: 'Don’t look for us. We will serve Allah – and we will die for him'. 

Since then their social media accounts have been used to pump out pro-Islamic State propaganda aimed at encouraging others to join them.

The pair are thought to have been married to Chechen rebels as soon as they arrived in Syria, and are both now believed to be pregnant.

Security sources reported earlier this month that both of the youngsters had been in contact saying they regretted their decision and wanted to return home, but were told it may not be possible.

This claim had reportedly infuriated ISIS leaders who are waging a constant propaganda war in order to lure young, impressionable people to their cause. 

According to anti-terrorism police in the girls' homeland, it is almost certain that they would have been ordered to retract anything they had said to keep the flow of recruits coming.

Sabina (left) and Samra (right), began posting images of their new lives abroad in an attempt to get other girls to join them, and now authorities fear Viktoria and Violetta may have done exactly that

An Austrian security insider said: 'If they really want it to be believable that the girls are now claiming they don't want to come home, they should let them give the interview on neutral territory where it's possible to see that they aren't being threatened by a gun. 

'If the claim they want to come home is untrue, they have the opportunity to walk back into Syria.'

Meanwhile Setaniye has filed a complaint with Austrian police to say that her daughters are missing, but police and the Austrian Interior Ministry have so-far declined to comment

However, an insider said the disappearance was a cause for concern, and was being investigated.
