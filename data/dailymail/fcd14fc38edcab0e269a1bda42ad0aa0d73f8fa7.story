A seal has been rescued after being found 50 miles from the sea following several weeks of violent weather around Britain.

Similarly, a dolphin was stranded on a beach after apparently being swept inland by the storms and floods which have plagued the country since before Christmas.

The seal was spotted in a tributary of the River Eden in the Pennines by worried farmers who reported their sighting to Morecambe Bay Search and Rescue.

Saved: This seal was found swimming around a river in the Pennines after being swept 50 miles inland thanks to stormy weather

Rescue: Workers tend to the seal after it was seen by farmers and reported to the local search and rescue operation

Transported: The animal was checked by a vet and then taken to the coastline to be returned to the sea

It was caught and then driven 50 miles away to Walney in Barrow-on-Furness where it was released into the ocean yesterday.

Mike Davis, from the search 
and rescue charity, said: 'We can only think the seal lost its bearings 
in stormy weather and then began swimming in the wrong direction.

'The seal was very thin when we found it, and I canâ€™t think that it would have survived for much longer.

'It
 was really quite difficult to catch, the seals are slippery things. We 
then took it to the station, where we weighed it and ensured it was 
healthy.'

Destination: The snaimal is pictured being released into the Irish Sea from Walney, in Barrow-in-Furness

Freedom: The seal pictured waddling off the the water at the conclusion of the rescue operation

Journey: The seal was found in the Pennines, having travelled from the sea along the River Eden

After the veterinary examination, a crew left the seal in an open cage on the beach, and 15 minutes later it crawled out and into the sea.

In Cornwall, a dolphin washed up onto Par beach near St Austell and was found by two women walking along the sand.

The animal was floating face-down in a pool before the passers-by waded in to the water and kept it upright.

Volunteers from British Divers Marine Life Rescue rushed to the scene along with a vet, and helped the dolphin return to the ocean.

Stranded: A dolphin was washed up on the beach in Cornwall and unable to swim away

Trouble: The dolphin had to be saved by passers-by who noticed its distress and helped it swim off

Close-run thing: The dolphin might have died if it had not been saved by the bystanders

The carcass of a sperm whale which washed up on a beach near Edinburgh on Saturday has now been towed to a deep-water harbour for removal.

The 14-metre mammal apparently died after being hit by a boat in deep waters, and was then propelled towards the shore.

It was not possible for the local council to remove the whale from the water, so it was towed along the Firth of Forth to a deep water harbour in Fife where it will be lifted by a crane.

It will then be taken to a Scottish 
Marine Animal Stranding Scheme facility in East Lothian, where officials
 hope to perform autopsy to determine the cause of death.

Stepping in: Local wildlife experts helped move the animal from the patch of sand it was stranded on

Goodbye: Well-wishers look on as the dolphin finally swims away from Par beach near St Austell
