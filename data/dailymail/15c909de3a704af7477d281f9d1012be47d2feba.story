The BBC newsroom was plunged into chaos when news broke that the Duke of Edinburgh had been taken ill, it was claimed today.

Staff were left scrabbling for sombre clothes and black ties in the event that Prince Philip's Christmas Eve heart scare developed into something more serious.

The Corporation clearly fear a repeat of Peter Sissons's infamous appearance wearing a burgundy tie when announcing the death of the Queen Mother. 

BBC newsreader Peter Sissons criticised for not wearing a black tie when he announced the Queen Mother had died in 2002, choosing burgundy instead

Sissons himself told the Telegraph: 'According to my spies, those who were working over this year's holiday period lived in fear that the duke might pop off on their shift.'

'Obituaries and black ties were dusted off, and the festive atmosphere in the newsroom was overshadowed by the certainty  that if they were needed, whichever producer drew the short straw would be consigned to outer darkness once the editorial post mortems started.'

Sissons also tells how Tim Luckhurst, a former BBC news editor, when thinking about a senior member of the Royal family dying, would say: 'Please God, not on my shift.'

The Queen’s husband was airlifted to Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire on Friday night after he complained of chest pains. Following tests, doctors discovered a blocked artery and inserted a small surgical stent to open it up and restore the blood flow to his heart.

Although the procedure is relatively common and considered ‘minimally invasive’, doctors were taking no chances given his age and kept the prince in hospital for four nights – much to the notoriously grumpy royal’s displeasure.

He was finally released yesterday morning, when he rejoined his family at the Queen's Sandringham estate.

Just hours after arriving back at the royal country retreat, he joined members of the Royal Family at a shooting party lunch.

The family ate together at Wood Farm in Wolferton, which is situated on the estate and often used as an informal weekend retreat by the royals.

Prince Philip was seen sitting in the front seat of a Land Rover as he was driven away from the farmhouse at 1.45pm to return to the main house.

Meanwhile the rest of the party returned to the pheasant shoot on the 20,000 acre estate. A keen shot even now, Philip was desperately disappointed to have missed the traditional shoot this year but at least was able to attend the lunch.
