The thief worked with ‘ninja-like’ speed and precision...and an audacity that suggests he perhaps did not know he was on camera.

These pictures show how a masked raider prised the door of an art gallery open with a crowbar, snatched two Damien Hirst paintings and was gone again in under a minute.

The pieces, worth £33,000, had only just gone up in the shop in Notting Hill, West London.

Thief in the night: This is the moment two signed Damian Hirst works of art worth £33,000 were stolen from the gallery 

Out the door: The robber used a crow-bar to break into the Notting Hill gallery before driving off at around 3am on Monday

Stolen art: This signed Damien Hirst piece, Pyronin Y, has been taken in the night from a west London gallery and is said to be worth £15,000

The heist in the early hours of Monday
morning has left police mystified as the thief picked the pieces over 
more valuable works by the award-winning artist.

He
took two similar paintings, Pyronin Y, which was completed in 2005 and 
is worth £15,000, and Oleoylsarcosine, from 2008 and worth £18,000. 
Hirst’s series of spot paintings, categorised by colourful dots in 
different patterns, are among his most widely recognised works.

Last
night, investigators were studying CCTV footage captured over the past 
week to see if the thief made an earlier reconnaissance trip to the 
gallery.

One line of inquiry is he was working for a criminal who wanted to add the distinctive pieces to his collection.

Gallery manager Nathan Engelbrecht, 31, said: ‘The police think it might have been stolen to order.

‘It
is also possible they targeted the Hirst spot pieces because he knew 
they would be easier to sell. There are more expensive items here. There
is also another Hirst painting – not a spot one – but he left that 
behind even though it was right next to one of them.’

The Exhibition Gallery, which opened in September, has a burglar alarm but it didn’t go off.

The
gallery manager said the paintings had only gone up a few days ago 
after weeks of negotiation with Hirst’s team.

‘We are a small gallery 
and we had to convince them we could sell them and keep them safe,’ said
Mr Engelbrecht.

‘Looks like we failed at both.’ The CCTV shows that at 
the same time as the raid, delivery men were outside a restaurant across
the road.

Mr Engelbrecht said from the footage it is clear the thief 
knew what he was looking for. ‘He was in and out within a minute,’ he 
said.

Scene of crime: The incident happened at around 3am on Monday where this gallery was broken into and the art taken. Manager Nathan Engelbrecht (pictured) has said it was without a working alarm

Upset: Mr Engelbrecht said the thieves had crow-barred open the front door before ripping the art off the walls

‘If you watch it on 
CCTV he knows exactly what he’s doing. He was completely covered up – 
balaclava, hood, goggles, gloves. It was clearly a professional job. It 
was all done with ninja-like speed and precision.

‘It is quite unbelievable how brazen he was because this is a busy street, even in the middle of night.’

The
glass-fronted shop is two doors down from Notting Hill Book Shop – the 
inspiration for Richard Curtis’s hit film Notting Hill.

Det
Sgt Jon Lightfoot of the Met said: ‘It appears the suspect has 
specifically targeted the two pieces. They would have been visible in 
the back of the car and we are appealing for witnesses to come forward.’

A spokesman for Hirst said: ‘This is a police matter and I’m afraid we cannot comment.’

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Serious Acquisitive Crime Unit at Notting Hill Police Station on 020 8246 0230 or, to remain anonymous, Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Long considered the bad boy of British art, Bristol born Damien Hirst's rise to the top has been remarkable.

Despite achieving only a grade E in his art A-Level, the 48-year-old was at the forefront of the Young British Artists movement in the nineties.

After setting up an art factory producing work that made him famous, he is the world’s wealthiest living artist, with a reported fortune of £215million.

Prices for Hirst’s works, which include animal carcasses preserved in formaldehyde, spot paintings and medicine cabinet sculptures, have fallen sharply recently - down by 30 per cent since their 2008 peak. One in three of his pieces has failed to sell at all.

In 2008, Mr Hirst sold sell 218 works through auctioneers Sotheby's, reportedly raising £111m.

His most famous work is the 'The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living' from 1991, a shark in formaldehyde, which sold for $12m in 2005.

Another controversial piece is 'For the Love of God', consisting of a real human skull studded with 8,601 diamonds.

It was put up for sale at £50m in 2007 and acquired by a consortium.

Art dealer and collector Charles Saatchi was an early fan and offered Hirst a £50,000 commission to do whatever he liked, resulting in the famous shark in formaldehyde.

There was a setback when a fin fell off, the liquid went murky and the shark turned green and wrinkled. But his curators skinned it, got rid of the decomposing body and stretched the skin over a fibreglass mould and it was sold to an American collector for around $12 million.

Other works using formaldehyde include a dead cow and calf split in two and exhibited in separate glass containers and dead sheep.

A series of 'spin' paintings were criticised as childish with even Hirst himself admitting to having seen the technique demonstrated on Blue Peter.

He is unmarried and has three children with long-term girlfriend Maia Norman.
