A southern California high school football star nicknamed 'Sweet Feet' by Snoop Dogg has been accused of raping two underage girls while his teammate is also facing sexual assault charges.

Kishawn Tre Holmes and Byron Holt Jr., both 17-year-old students at Vista Murrieta High School about 60 miles southeast of Los Angeles, were arrested Thursday and appeared in Riverside County juvenile court Tuesday.

Holmes, running back for the varsity team, was charged with raping two different girls through the use of force or fear and performing lewd acts on a child under 14.

He was also charged with trying to dissuade one of his alleged rape victims from speaking to authorities and faces three counts of false imprisonment involving three other girls, prosecutors said.

According to CBSLA.com, Holt faces three felony charges of consensual sex with a minor under 14.

All three counts involve the same victim, according to his attorney.

A judge ruled Tuesday that Holmes must remain in juvenile detention until his next court appearance on October 30. Holt will be allowed to return home but must be under 24-hour parental supervision until he returns to court on October 24.

A school police officer launched an investigation into the conduct of the two suspects on August 29 and the disturbing case was soon turned over to local police.

The District Attorney said six female students have come forward to accuse the football players of sexual misconduct.

The alleged sexual assaults date back to 2012 with the most recent incident occurring in August.

'The acts did not take place on the school campus and they did not take place in conjunction with any school activity,' Karen Perris of the Murrieta School District told CBS.

The defendants both played varsity football for the top-ranked Vista Murrieta High School Broncos.

Holmes was a star running back during the team's last season and his Facebook account is littered with photographs of himself playing football and status updates about games and training.

One photograph shows him posing with Snoop Dogg at a game in Diamond Bar, California, last February.

He said the rapper and football fan nicknamed him 'Sweet Feet' and the nickname has remained with him.

Despite being minors, Holmes and Holt were named by prosecutors due to the severity of the charges.

Tuesday's detention hearing was initially open to the public but closed shortly after it started at the request of the victims' families, prosecutors said.

One victim's father told CBS: ''I will say to have your child attending a school that's in fear and harassed by others is simply not fair, and we will just wait to see the outcome.'

Holt's mother insisted her son was innocent.

'I just want his name cleared, because Byron is a good kid,' his mother, Tasha Penniman, said.
