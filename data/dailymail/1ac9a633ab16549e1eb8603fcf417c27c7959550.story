An obese man who shed nine stone of excess fat is now competing in bodybuilding competitions.

Daniel Blythe of Wrexham, north Wales, weighed in at 21 stone in 2010 and was given a warning by his doctor to lose weight.

But after shedding the pounds and starting weight training he is now competing in bodybuilding championships, something he would never have thought possible just three years earlier.

Daniel, from Wrexham, once weighed 21 stone but went down to 12 through eating healthily and dieting. He 
is now 14 stone after putting on two stone of muscle in the gymÂ  and 
competes in bodybuilding championships

Mr Blythe, 33, said: 'When I was in my early twenties I started my own window cleaning business which became quite successful.

'I started to sit back in the office and became lazy.

'I wasn't going to the gym or anything and I was eating really bad food.

'I would have three or four takeaways a week such as pizzas and kebabs.

'I reached 21 and a half stone.'

In 2010, Daniel took a trip to the doctor and was told to lose weight.

It was the incentive he needed to change his lifestyle - and his diet - for good.

'I went to the doctors and he told me I needed to lose weight for the good of my health.

'It really was a kick up the backside,' added Daniel.

Daniel said that while he looked at holiday photos and saw a large man looking back at him, he never saw himself as quite the weight he really was.

'I didn't see myself as 21 stone,' Daniel confesses now.

'When I looked back at pictures of myself on holiday I thought: "I need to lose weight".'

Daniel stopped eating fat-laden takeaways in the evening.

Instead of spending time on the sofa, he started going to the gym, initially to lose weight and get back into shape, but later to build muscle and change his shape.

He started spending every morning and evening in the gym, focusing mainly on cardiovascular work.

After losing nine stone of excess fat Daniel began to start weight training and went up to 14 stone - adding on two stone of muscle - and that is where his weight has settled now.

Mr Blythe says he looks back at holiday photos and realises he was overweight

'It was really hard and took a lot of getting used to, but now I've gone from one extreme to the other,' he said.

'I feel a lot fitter and a lot more confident and I don't get tired just walking up the stairs anymore.

'I'm 33 but I feel better now than I ever did in my twenties.'

Daniel is still the owner of DSB Cleaning Services in Wrexham, but now leads a healthier lifestyle with his partner Kayleigh Pickup and his 15-year-old son Connor Arrowsmith.

He recently competed in the Strong Seniors Class at the North West Bodybuilding Championships where he finished fourth.

He now says that he has plans to compete in many more competitions in the future.

Daniel puts his success down to Craig Hughes, the owner of Valhalla Gym where he works out daily.

He said: 'I have to thank Craig and the gym for all the help they have given me.

'Without Craig this wouldn't have happened, he really helped me with my diet and regime.'

Mr Hughes, who has worked as a nutritionist in the Wrexham area for 20 years said: 'It is a fantastic change.

'To lose nine stone is one thing, but to transform two stone of that into muscle is really hard to do.

'All the lads in the gym are shocked.'
