360 degrees of consumption: The entire lid of the can is removable, 'enhancing the drinking experience'

Whether or not you believe in the old adage 'if it ain't broke don't fix it', one company is trying to change the way we consume beverages on-the-go.

The Sly Fox Brewing Company has come up with the novel idea of a 360 degree lid.

Drinkers peel off the top of the can and enjoy the contents as if drinking from a regular cup.

The technology has been developed by Crown Holdings, Inc.

The company say the entire lid of the can is removable and 'essentially eliminates the need for separate glassware.'

Instead
of cracking open a small hole on the top of the can, the 360 Lid allows
the top to be completely removed, creating an aluminum beer cup.

It functions like that of a soup can, with a peel-back lid, exposing a 1.75-inch opening.

Sly Fox Brewing Company will become the first brewery in North America to utilize the innovative 360 Lid.

'This
technology allows the full flavor and aroma of the beer to hit the 
drinker's senses and makes the can an even more appealing package for 
outdoor activities and situations where you want to be able to move around and sip your beer easily,' said Sly Fox Brewing Company head brewer Brian O'Reilly.

'Craft
brew enthusiasts want to enjoy their beer as it was meant to be 
experienced whether at home or at an event and the 360 Lid makes the 
beverage can the perfect vessel to do just that.'

Cup in hand: Forget about glasses - the 360 lid allows drinks cans to be turned into an aluminum cup

Sly Fox is rolling it out on its 
Helles Golden Lager before moving on to other cans. Right now, Sly Fox 
is only available in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Delaware.

The cans also have another environmental payoff in that the can could be used over and over. The metal too is 100% recyclable.

The lid seems to have had a fairly 
positive reaction online although some are concerned that the circular 
design might simple lead to unfortunate instances of people cutting 
their fingers or lips on the thin metallic edge.

The designers say the top of the can has been specially designed to be sipped out of and has a blunted edge.

Others
have also pointed out that lid can be thrown out to create litter just 
like the old pull tabs of the 1970s and of course the drink is more 
likely to spill when walking or driving.

Different: You can almost understand why someone was more interested in taking a picture of a can rather than the on-the-field action

Exclusive design: The 360 degree can for Pikeland Pils will be offered exclusively at Citizens Bank Park, this spring and summer, the baseball stadium that's the home of the Philadelphia Phillies
