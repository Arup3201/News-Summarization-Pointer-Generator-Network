A seven-year-old girl has uncovered the 100 million year old bones of an extinct  dolphin-like marine reptile that once swam through Australia's ancient inland sea.

Amber Wilson was on a family holiday with her parents Tony and Lisa and brother Darcy in outback Queensland when she came across the fossilised bones of an ichthyosaur - a seven-metre animal that was around in the dinosaur age.

The Wilsons  had stopped at a known fossil site near the Kronosaurus Korner museum in Richmond, 500km west of Townsville, at the end of their family holiday in July when they made the discovery.

Amber uncovered a large hockey puck-shaped vertebra hidden amongst a pile of rocks, before her family helped discover part of the 1.5m long skull with six centimetre long teeth shortly afterwards.

'Money couldn't buy the incredible experience our family got from finding this fossil,' Mr Wilson said. 

The family from Wiseleigh in eastern Victoria quickly called for help from the staff at the museum to unearth the huge fossil.

'I was completely stunned. A professional palaeontologist might search their entire career to find a fossil of this quality. It only took the Wilson family a few hours,' Dr Timothy Holland, Kronosaurus Korner's  Curator, said.

Nine people were required to lift the estimated 400kg weight of the specimen after it was covered in a protective coating of plaster, newspaper and hessian

'I have never seen tourists uncover such a beautifully preserved fossil before. It is easily the most complete ichthyosaur skull in our collection and one of the best from Australia.

'We normally run tours out to the free fossil site to show people how to look and dig for fossils. But we didn't need to for the Wilson family, they went out and found it all on their own.' 

A protective coating of plaster, newspaper and hessian was applied to the bones before the fossil, now nicknamed 'Wilson', was hoisted out of the ground. 

Nine people were required to lift the estimated 400kg weight of the specimen. Additional rock was removed from the bones using dentist tools and toothbrushes over the following four months.

'When I removed the surrounding rock and saw that the snout was complete to the very tip, it took my breath away,' volunteer Gary Flewelling said. 

'When there is a specimen as good as 'Wilson' to work on in the lab, each day is Christmas.' 

An ichthyosaur was a seven metre long marine reptile that propelled itself underwater with its powerful tail and changed direction using four broad flippers.

The fossilised stomach contents of some specimens include the bones of fish, turtles and birds. It lived 100 million years ago when dinosaurs still roamed the earth
