The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall have been hobnobbing with some of America's biggest stars during a reception in London this evening.

Charles and Camilla were at an event for Americans living and working in the UK ahead of their visit to the USA.

They mingled with designer Tom Ford, Downton Abbey star Elizabeth McGovern, and Hunger Games and Fortitude actor Stanley Tucci.

Camilla wore a blue lace cocktail dress by Edina Ronay to the reception which was hosted by US Ambassador Matthew Barzun and Brooke Brown Barzun at Winfield House in the capital. 

The royal couple will make a four day visit to the US on March 17, spending much of their time in Kentucky and Washington D.C. 

They will undertake a range of engagements to promote the UK's partnership with the US in areas such as sustainability and climate change, creating youth opportunities, encouraging corporate social responsibility. 

The couple will also be in the country to promote historical and cultural links between the two nations and will have a meeting with President Obama at the White House.

Charles has visited the US in an official capacity 19 times since 1970, and his last visit was in May 2011 when his programme included a call on President Obama at the White House.

Camilla has visited the US officially twice with Charles - in 2005 and 2007.

Their visit in 2005 was their first official overseas tour conducted jointly as the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall and came just months after their wedding.

Earlier, the royal couple had spent the afternoon at Westminster Abbey alongside the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Queen and Prince Philip.

The sextet were there to mark Commonwealth Day, an organisation of 53 nations of which the Queen remains head.

Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall will travel to Maltese capital Valletta in November for the bi-annual Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.
