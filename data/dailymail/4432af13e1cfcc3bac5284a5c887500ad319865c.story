She has become known as a shrewd socialite, throwing lavish garden parties for the military's top brass and referring to the most influential as 'close friends'.

And now, Jill Kelley, the Florida housewife whose complaint over threatening emails revealed David Petraeus' affair, has attempted to exploit her connections once again.

In her first words since her part in the scandal was revealed over the weekend, Kelley has sent a string of pleading emails to the Tampa Mayor, complaining she has been receiving threats and claiming: 'The truth will one day prevail.'

Anxious: Jill Kelley, pictured leaving her Florida home earlier this week, has written pleading emails to the Tampa mayor complaining that she has been receiving threats and no help from the police

The anguished messages, seen by the Tampa Bay Times, were sent in the early hours of Tuesday and Wednesday to Bob Buckhorn, whom she knows socially.

She claims her three children are scared to return home and her doctor husband has been forced to sleep at the hospital because he cannot get into their driveway, due to the swarms of media.

'Dear Mayor Bob,' she wrote, adding that she, Petraeus and 
General John R. Allen - whom she was found to have exchanged 'flirtatious' emails with - 'have been exploited by the media'.

'I 
wouldn't care - if they got the facts right and the focus was on the 
criminal that stalked all of us,' she added, apparently referring to Petraeus' mistress Paula Broadwell. 'But the truth will 
one day prevail.'

It is the second instance of her trying to exploit her 'position' - after she called the police asking for 'diplomatic protection' from the media due to her role as honorary consul to South Korea.

'I'm an honorary consul general, so I have inviolability, so they should not be able to cross my property,' she told the 911 operator. 'I don't know if you want to get diplomatic protection involved as well, because that's against the law to cross my property because, you know, it's inviolable.'

But the move backfired - with the police releasing the calls to the media and failing to provide her the protection reserved for those in positions of genuine authority.

'To put insult to injury, your police dept gave the local 911 tapes to the press!' she wrote to Buckhorn, adding that the recordings included her cell number, so 'I have been receiving threats all night'.

'I'm scared and cannot believe what my city, in which I have contributed so much of my love, time, money and leadership, has now done to me and my innocent family,' Kelley wrote.

Buckhorn told the Times that he did 
nothing in response to Kelley's complaint and simply said that the 911 
recordings were public records.

He added that he knew the Kelleys 
socially after he won the mayoral race in March 2011 - even though they 
did not support him in his bid and he had never met them before.

Emails: Kelley sent messages to Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn complaining about her treatment

Yet just three weeks after he was sworn into office, the doctor and his wife hosted a reception for him at their lavish $1.3 million home on Bayshore Boulevard.

Kelley has since invited him to a string of social events, including her daughter's sixth birthday party, which are also documented by email, the Times reported.

She invited him and his wife to a dinner party for the King of Jordan and, after he was unable to attend, she wrote to him again.

'The King and his sister (the Princess) are awesome 
people!' she said. 'Actually your name was brought up 
by the Generals when they were showing off the party I hosted you! 
(everyone loved that party).'

They met again when he and his wife gave her a ride home following an event at MacDill Air Force Base, for which she organised events as a volunteer social liaison officer.

'Gen. [James] Mattis, was so kind to offer, but I realised
you two were passing my way,' she emailed the mayor the following day.

Their messages also show how she involved herself in a spat over a radio host's claims that he was going to deep fat fry the Koran earlier this year, according to the Times.

Officers at MacDill told the mayor that the publicity stunt could harm troops, and asked him to speak with the host.

Kelley also called the mayor to tell them she had been speaking with 
Gen. Allen and Vice Admiral Robert Harward, the deputy commander of 
CentCom, who said they needed the mayor's help.

When Buckhorn responded to say it was being dealt with, she said 'they asked me to get involved, like I did when it happened with the Pastor last year'.

Kelley's shrewd social-climbing tactics also came to light this week when she was pictured with Marco Rubio and her twin sister, Natalie Khawam, when he was running for the Senate.

The photograph was tweeted by Republican Angelette Aviles who said that it was taken at a March 2010 fundraiser, where tickets were $1,000.

But the twins didn't pay - instead, they
appeared, took the photo and left, Aviles told the Times. They did not 
contribute to his campaign.

Yet over the past week, Kelley's connections have given her more exposure than she was perhaps intending.

After David Petraeus dramatically resigned from the top of the CIA last Friday, it emerged that Kelley had played a key role in exposing his affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell.

In May, Kelley alerted the FBI that she had been receiving threatening, anonymous emails warning her to 'back off' Petraeus, whom Kelley and her husband are good friends with.

The FBI was forced to launch an in-depth investigation as some messages contained classified information about Petraeus' whereabouts, and they feared there could have been a security breach.

The catty emails were traced back to Broadwell and, in the process of the investigation, agents also uncovered messages revealing the affair between the biographer and Petraeus.

The scandal later dragged in another general, the U.S. Commander in Afghanistan, General John Allen, after the FBI investigated Kelley's emails from Broadwell.

During the probe, they reportedly uncovered 20,000 to 30,000 pages of email correspondence between Allen and Kelley, which officials said were 'flirtatious' and likened them to 'phone sex'.

Both Allen and Kelley deny any wrongdoing. But Kelley has been told has been that she is no longer welcome at the military HQ near her Florida home.
