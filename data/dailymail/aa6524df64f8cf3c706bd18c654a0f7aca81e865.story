A rare World War Two Nissen hut lived in for 56 years by two wartime land girls in Sussex is up for sale.

The dilapidated hut - which sits on an acre of land and is surrounded by crumbling outbuildings including a pig sty - was owned by Vera Barlow and Edith Hooper until they died months apart last year, aged 87 and 92.

The building in Chidham near 
Chichester, West Sussex, was used for housing Canadian soldiers manning 
ack ack guns to protect the local harbour area during the Second World 
War.

'Disrepair': The hut - which is in 'a state of disrepair' sits in an acre of land and is surrounded by dilapidated outbuildings including a pig sty

Lifelong friends 
Miss Barlow and Miss Hooper were well known about the local community and washed dishes at a local hospital, kept 
livestock and did a local egg round to earn money.

Due to its semi-cylindrical shape and layer of corrugated iron sheets the Nissen hut deflected shrapnel and bomb blast making it a perfect bomb shelter.

Land girls: The home was owned by former land girls Vera Barlow and Edith Hooper from 1956 until early 2012 when they both passed away aged 87 and 92

They drove around in an old Bedford van, owned a motorbike, and shared an old grey Ferguson tractor.

The three-bedroom hut is described by estate agents Stride & Son based in Chichester as in a 'poor state of repair' but the site is 'ready for redevelopment' subject to planning laws.

Estate agent Nick Stride said they weren't listing a guide price for the property because of the 'uniqueness' of the site and that they were selling it by tender.

He added: 'We think it was actually built for the First World War before certainly being used in the Second World War.

'It is extremely unusual to get a one-acre building plot like this - even more so to be so near a harbour.'

Interested buyers should submit offers in writing to Stride and Son's officers by February 28.

The Nissen's original design was masterminded by Major Peter Norman Nissen of the 29th Company Royal Engineers of the British Army during the First World War after which the British government ordered 100,000 for sites across the UK.

Home sweet home: Previous owners and lifelong friends Miss Barlow and Miss Hooper washed dishes at a local hospital, kept livestock and did a local egg round to earn money

Disrepair: Despite the fact that the property has fallen into disrepair, its estate agents say the rates have been paid since 1956 and everything runs as it should

Its main selling point was that it used relatively few materials and was easily portable.

Indeed, the Nissen hut could be packed in a standard Army wagon and erected by six men in four hours. The world record for erection was 1 hour 27 minutes.

After a stay of absence from British production lines, the Nissen re-emerged during the Second World War and used for a wide range of functions from accommodation to churches and bomb stores.

Very few survive, but examples can still be found in the UK, the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific.
