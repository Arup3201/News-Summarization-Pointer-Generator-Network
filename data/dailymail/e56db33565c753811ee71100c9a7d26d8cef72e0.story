Comedian Stephen Colbert defied his critics on Friday by going ahead with a paid appearance as the closing speaker at the RSA computer security conference in San Francisco.

This year’s event took place in the wake of reports in December about the group’s previously undisclosed $10 million contract with the NSA to build a back door for the government agency into encryption software.

Privacy group Fight for the Future started an online petition asking Colbert not to attend, while a number of other speakers dropped out following the revelations.

Colbert avoided questions from the media outside the event, but once on stage he used his blustering right-leaning TV character as a vehicle for a series quips about privacy and security in the wake of Edward Snowden’s NSA leeks last year, reports CNN.

‘Now a lot of people, maybe some in this room, were upset to learn I’d be speaking here today. Many of you see me as a champion of privacy,’ Colbert told the crowd.

‘Which I know because I read your emails,’ he joked. ‘Normally I’m asked not to be somewhere only after I’ve spoken.’

Colbert was quick to defend the RSA and his decision to keep the paid gig. As a freedom lover, he doesn't engage in boycotts, he joked. And his conscience was clear, as long as his checked cleared.

On the subject of Snowden, Colbert referred to him as 'practically a war criminal'.

'We can trust the NSA because without a doubt it is history's most powerful, pervasive, sophisticated surveillance agency ever to be totally pawned by a 29-year-old with a thumb drive,' said Colbert.

The TV presenter also said he wasn’t terribly worried about the NSA reading his emails.

‘I don’t necessarily want people reading my emails but I’m not a spy, I don’t run a crime syndicate,” he said.

‘I’ve got things I don’t want people to know but I didn’t really go running for cover for a new way to encrypt.’

Ultimately, Colbert said Americans can only blame themselves for the security state in which they live.

'We all deserve credit for this new surveillance state that we live in because we the people voted for the Patriot Act. Democrats and Republicans alike,' he said.

'We voted for the people who voted for it, and then voted for the people who reauthorized it, then voted for the people who re-re-authorized it.'

The RSA traditionally ends its week-long conference with a big-name speaker from the world of politics, such as Bill Clinton and Condoleezza Rice.
