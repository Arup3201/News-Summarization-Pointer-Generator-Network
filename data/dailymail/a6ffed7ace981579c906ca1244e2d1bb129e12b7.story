The weight of the world is currently resting heavily on Teresa Giudice's shoulders.

So it's no wonder she looked puffy-eyed and much older than her 41 years as she emerged in New Jersey on Wednesday.

Perhaps trying to detract from her weary appearance, the Real Housewives Of New Jersey star donned a garish purple outfit as she headed to the gym.

The eyes give her away: Teresa Giudice looked like she'd endured a sleepless and likely tearful night as she hit the gym in New Jersey on Wednesday

With her hair pulled back and wearing 
next to no war paint, the mom-of-four stood out in her purple patterned 
three-quarter leggings, which she teamed with a near-matching purple 
T-shirt, black socks and white runners.

Later than evening, however, it was a perfectly coiffed Teresa who attended the Beauty Buster Awards in New York City.

Her long dark hair in perfect curls and with her signature heavily kohl-rimmed eyes and nude lips, she didn't miss the chance to promote her Milania Hair Care line.

Trying to distract us? The Real Housewives Of New Jersey star donned a garish, eye-catching purple outfit - but all eyes were on her pained expression

'You can't stop living': Photographer Lora Warnick revealed the star was 'in good spirits' and 'didn't seem depressed at all' as she attended the Beauty Buster Awards in New York City on Wednesday night

The star put on a brave face at the 
event, pouring herself into a tight-fitting royal blue off-the-shoulder 
dress with strap detail around the neck.

'You
can't stop living,' she rather cheerily said as she posed for 
photographer Lora Warnick - who noted that the star appeared to be 'in 
good spirits' and 'didn't seem depressed at all' as she chatted with 
guests, according to RadarOnline.

Just a day earlier, the New Jersey native and her husband of 15 years, Giuseppe 'Joe' Giudice, made an appearance of a very different kind - at the Martin Luther King Jr courthouse in Newark, New Jersey, after being charged with 39 counts of fraud.

Disheveled: An unshaven Joe Giudice was spotted on Thursday outside his home in Towaco, New Jersey for the first time since posting bail two days earlier

The multitude of indictments included
conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, making false 
statements on loan applications and bankruptcy fraud.

Joe
is also charged with failing to file tax returns between 2004 and 2008,
during which time it is alleged he earned close to $1 million.

The businessman also faces further charges in Passaic County, after obtaining a driver's licence using his brother's identity.

A united front: Joe and Teresa arrived hand-in-hand to their court hearing at the Martin Luther King Jr Federal Courthouse in Newark, New Jersey, after being indicted on 39 charges of fraud

The 43-year-old rejected a plea deal through his lawyer, Miles Feinstein, in April.

Neither
husband nor wife entered a plea during Tuesday's brief court session 
and they were released on a combined $1 million unsecured bail bond.

Judge
Cathy Waldor did, however, order them to surrender their passports and 
restricted their travels to New Jersey and New York amid fears of a 
'great escape' to Italy.

Speaking to the masses of gathered reporters at the courthouse following the proceedings, US Attorney Paul Fishman confirmed, 'We are confident we have enough evidence to convict the defendants beyond a reasonable doubt.'

Out on bail: The couple were charged with 39 counts of fraud and released on a combined $1 million bail following their brief court appearance in which neither entered a plea

While Teresa's attorney, Henry 
Klingeman, says he believes the government is prosecuting the couple 
because of their celebrity, it seems he's not the only one who thinks 
fame is playing a pivotal role in the proceedings.

Fellow
reality TV star and former New York City Real Housewife Bethenny 
Frankel has given her unfiltered opinion on the situation.

Asked
to comment on the developing saga while promoting her talk show, 
Bethenny, at the TCA Tour Panel in Beverly Hills on Wednesday, the 
42-year-old said, 'My first thought today was, "Oh, if they weren't on 
reality TV, none of this would probably ever be exposed."'

Further charges: Joe is also charged with failing to file tax returns between 2004 and 2008, during which time it is alleged he earned close to $1 million

She continued, 'It's just funny how 
certain people are [like a] moth to a flame. It's almost like, not that 
you want to get caught, but people who love to be in the spotlight often
have a lot of skeletons in their closet. It's just an interesting 
thing.

'Do I feel sorry for them? No, I 
don't,' she stated honestly. 'Not so much, because it broke the law. You
broke the law and you went on television. That's not really that 
smart.'

The mom-of-one did,
however, express sympathy for the couple's children - Gia, 12, 
Gabriella, 10, Milania, seven, and Audriana, three - who have been 
caught up in the drama.

No support here: Former Real Housewives Of New York City star Bethenny Frankel said, 'Do I feel sorry for them? No, I don't,' when asked about the situation at Wednesday's TCA Tour Panel

It's certainly an unsettling time for the entire Giudice family, with Teresa and Joe now each facing up to 50 years in jail if convicted on all charges.

Meanwhile, Joe could also potentially be deported back to Italy after it was revealed during the hearing that despite having been married to his American wife for more than a decade, the family patriarch is not a US Citizen.

The Giudices' hearing is set for August 14 and, according to their attorneys, both will plead not guilty.
