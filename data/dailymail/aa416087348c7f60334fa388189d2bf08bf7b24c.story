Britain’s top law officer yesterday paved the way for new inquests to be held into the 96 deaths at Hillsborough.

Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC said he was taking the ‘exceptional’ step of applying to the High Court to have the original verdicts of accidental death quashed.

His announcement came after a report into the 1989 disaster revealed last month that 41 fans could have been saved if the response of emergency services had been swifter.

Ninety-six Liverpool fans died in the crush at the Hillsborough ground in Sheffield, but only this year has new evidence confirmed the need for fresh inquests

It also revealed a vast cover-up by 
police and paramedics designed to blame Liverpool fans for the tragedy. 
Families of the victims hope new inquests will record verdicts of 
corporate manslaughter.

Mr Grieve said he was still 
considering the new evidence, but would apply for fresh inquests to be 
held on the basis of what he has already read.

He said he was making the announcement early to ease the ‘anxiety’ of victims’ families.

‘My view is that I will apply to have
every one of those 96 inquests quashed,’ he told MPs. ‘I believe that 
these deaths, arising as they do from a common chain of events, should 
all be considered afresh.’

It was clear there were ‘significant 
issues over the original inquest’, he added. But he admitted the new 
legal process ‘will take some time’ and acknowledged that ‘the wait for 
truth and justice has been long and unspeakably painful for a great many
people’.

Attorney General Dominic Grieve said he would go to the High Court to quash the original 96 inquests into the deaths of the Liverpool fans killed in the Hillsborough tragedy

The report into the Hillsborough 
disaster, headed by the Bishop of Liverpool, rejected the findings of 
the original inquests that no lives could have been saved after 3.15pm 
on the day.

Pat Joynes, whose son Nicholas, 27, 
was killed, said: ‘I’m highly delighted. We want the accidental death 
verdicts quashed so we can get manslaughter verdicts.

‘I have spoken to different families 
over the weekend. That seems to be the opinion and it is what I would 
want as well – corporate manslaughter and manslaughter verdicts.

‘Ninety-six people can’t die and hundreds injured without someone being held responsible.

‘The truth, in my opinion, is finally
coming out, I’m very pleased. We want to see justice. If that means 
police officers have to stand trial, well they should stand trial in a 
criminal court.’

Mrs Joynes, who lives near St Helens, Merseyside, added that she hoped any new inquests would be held in Liverpool.

Former Labour Justice Secretary Lord 
Falconer, who has advised the victims’ families, said David Cameron had 
made a ‘huge difference’ to the campaign.

‘You have a government, led by a 
prime minister, saying, “This is a huge injustice, let’s sort it out” – 
and that makes a real difference,’ he said.

Liverpool MP Steve Rotheram said the 
move ‘marks one of the biggest steps forward in the fight for justice 
for the families in 23 years’.

Liverpool fans have spent 23 years campaigning for justice, including new inquests into the events of April 15 1989

‘The undeniable fact is that the 
original inquest was unsound and this application, if successful, will 
mean that evidence will be able to be heard after the 3.15pm cut off 
imposed by the original coroner in the 1989 inquests,’ he added.

‘For the first time in over two 
decades, all the evidence can now be reviewed into the disaster and 
potentially a new verdict recorded on the death certificates of the 
deceased.

‘At long last, the full horror of 
Hillsborough will be on the public record alongside the names of the 
people and the organisations that are accountable for what happened.’

He went on: ‘The families’ heartache 
has been well documented but what is less well known is that some 
families have refused to pick up the death certificates of their loved 
ones who died on that day.’

Last month’s report concluded police 
officers had tried to smear the dead by checking them for criminal 
records and medics had tried to prove they were drunk.

Hundreds of statements were doctored to remove criticism of the authorities.
