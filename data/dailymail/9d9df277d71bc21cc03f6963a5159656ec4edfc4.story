Throughout the world, Britain is renowned for its ability to stage events full of pomp and ceremony.

With the Queen's Diamond Jubilee taking place this year, there is no better time for the nation to show off its talents.

And, as these stunning pictures show, that is exactly what these dedicated trumpeters did yesterday.

World beaters: To mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, 91 trumpeters, from seven different military units set a new record for the longest line of fanfare trumpeters

Success: The Guinness World Records title attempt was staged by the Victoria Business Improvement District

To mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, they set a new record for the longest line of fanfare trumpeters.

A total of 91 trumpeters, from seven different military units, dressed in full ceremonial uniform to take part in the challenge at central London's Wellington Barracks.

The Wedding Fanfare was so loud it could be heard at nearby Buckingham Palace.

The Guinness World Records title attempt was staged by the Victoria Business Improvement District (BID).

Chief executive Ruth Duston said: 'This was a wonderful event, showcasing the wealth of cultural activity Victoria has to offer as well as celebrating our close links with the Royal Family.'

Cameron Thompson of Westminster City Council said: 'It's a fantastic and highly original way for this part of central London, with its very close royal connections, to celebrate Her Majesty's six decades on the throne.'

A host of events are taking place around the world to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee.

The Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant will take place on June 3.

The £10.5million event will see a flotilla of 1,000 boats and more than 20,000 participants take to the water in the largest celebration to be staged on the Thames for more than 300 years.

Stretching more than seven miles, the cavalcade – which includes a remarkable floating belfry and several orchestras and choirs, will make its way down the Thames from Battersea to Tower Bridge, with an estimated worldwide audience of a billion.

Every senior member of the Royal Family will be taking part, led by the Queen and Prince Philip who, accompanied by Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, William and Kate and Prince Harry, will take centre stage on the lavishly decorated royal barge bedecked with flowers.

Recent figures also revealed that at least 10,000 street parties have been organised across Britain to mark the occasion – double the number that celebrated last year’s Royal Wedding.

More than 6,500 roads will be closed to allow communities to commemorate the event – with thousands more parties held in church halls, parks and gardens.

Official figures suggest the number of celebrations held nationwide could even rival the Coronation.

Events organised range from a traditional knees-up in Newcastle for 70 houses, to a vegetarian meal for 500 organised by the Sikh Cultural Association of Preston.

Flick Rea, chairman of the Local Government Association’s culture and tourism board, said: ‘As early as January, councils were reporting a high interest in street parties and it soon became clear that we were going to see more than for the Royal Wedding.

‘It seems people had such a great time at street parties last year that they want to hold one again, and many of those who didn’t get involved don’t want to miss out this time round.

‘Britain’s street party tradition has been well and truly resurrected which is fantastic as it helps bring communities closer together.’

Most street parties will be held on Sunday, June 3 to coincide with the Diamond Jubilee Pageant.
