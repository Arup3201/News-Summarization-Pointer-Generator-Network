A 22-year-old Danish man interning at a New York preschool that caters to the children of international diplomats and UN employees has been accused of sexually abusing 13 children in his care.

Malthe Thomsen, who arrived in Manhattan in February to work at the International Preschool at 45th Street, has been in jail since last Friday, charged with 15 counts of first-degree sexual abuse.

Prosecutors say Thomsen placed the hands of nine different children on his genitals over his clothing and that he pressed the head of a 10th victim against his clothed genitals. He also allegedly touched several children on the buttocks.

Disturbing allegations: Malthe Thomsen is being held for sexual crimes against 13 children at a Manhattan preschool

Yesterday, a judge ruled he be kept in jail longer after hearing evidence from prosecutors that established 'probable cause that the defendent committed a felony.'

Thomsen's alleged crimes were witnessed by only one person - an assistant teacher named Gigi who has since been dismissed from her position for unrelated reasons, reports The New York Times.

The assistant teacher told colleagues at the school that she had seen Thomsen interact children 'in a way that she believed bordered on inappropriate touching.'

In a letter to parents on June 29, school director said the school had taken action as soon as Gigi made her claims, launching a full investigation, interviewing Thomsen's colleagues and monitoring him without his knowledge.

In addition, she wrote, school policy dictates that interns are not left alone with the children, and the school had found no evidence that Thomsen had ever been alone with any of the students.

The school found that the accusation was without foundation, she said.

None of the children have come forward with allegations of abuse.

Investigation: School officials say an internal investigation was conducted that found accusations against Thomsen had no basis - but say the school is cooperating fully with the criminal investigation

However, the school, founded in 1963 to cater to the children of UN families, is cooperating fully with the criminal investigation, she added.

It's unclear how police became involved, but Thomsen was arrested on June 27.

In court yesterday, proscutors played an hour-long video of a police interview with Thomsen from the day he was arrested in which they say he confessed to the crimes.

Defense: Thomsen's attorneys say the confession he made to police was coerced and no children have come forward with allegations of inappropriate behavior on Thomsen's part

Prosecutor Nicole Blumberg asked that the recording not be played in open court to protect the identities of the children mentioned, so headphones were used.

Thomsen's lawyers say the assistant teacher Gigi had a history of complaining about her coworkers, reports The New York Times.

The alleged confession was coerced, they say, because Thomsen only conceded that he could have touched the children innappropriately because detectives told him they had video of him doing so, untruthfully.

'This is another false confession case,' lawyer Jane Fisher-Byrialsen said.

'You’re telling me you have a video, he says, so I guess it happened but I have no memory of it.'

Thomsen's mother Birgitte Thomsen has flown to New York from Denmark to support her son.

She told the New York Daily News that Thomsen comes from a family of preschool teachers.

'In Denmark, we don’t have this fear of touching. It’s normal and common if a child is sad, you put him on your lap,' she said.

'He’s a very loving, caring guy. He’s not a child abuser.'
