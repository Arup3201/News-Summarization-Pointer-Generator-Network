Another weekend, another blank for Aston Villa in the Premier League.

The Birmingham side's long-suffering fans were looking forward to Christmas when they last saw their side score with league points at stake - Christian Benteke putting them in front at home to Manchester United on December 20.

Rather depressingly, it was just their 11th league goal of the season and, little did they know, that tally would still be the same in early February.

Since that 1-1 draw with United, Villa have failed to find the target against Swansea, Sunderland, Crystal Palace, Leicester, Liverpool and Arsenal.

Sunday's 5-0 thumping at the Emirates represented a fresh nadir for Paul Lambert's team and it is hardly going to get any easier - league leaders Chelsea await on Saturday.

Their paltry 'Goals For' tally is made to look all the more meagre by the fact there are no fewer than 14 players in Europe's leading five divisions that have scored more on their own this season than the entire Villa team.

In the Premier League, Chelsea's Diego Costa (17), Manchester City's Sergio Aguero (14), QPR's Charlie Austin (13) and Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez (12) have all surpassed Villa's league goals tally.

Out in Spain, Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo (28), Barcelona duo Lionel Messi (22) and Neymar (15), and Sevilla's Carlos Bacca (12) all have more.

In Italy's Serie A, Carlos Tevez of Juventus (13), Jeremy Menez of AC Milan (12) and Gonzalo Higuain of Napoli (12) have each outscored Lambert's team.

In the Bundesliga, Alexander Meier of Eintracht Frankfurt has scored 13 goals to Villa's 11.

And in the French Ligue 1, Alexandre Lacazette of Lyon (21) and Andre-Pierre Gignac of Marseille (14) have both been more prolific than the Villains.

There are also a further six players in those leagues that have 11 goals, the same as Villa.

The aforementioned goal drought now stands at 10 hours and 12 minutes ahead of Saturday's Chelsea visit and the infamously poor Derby side that played in the Premier League in 2007-08 managed a superior goals-per-game ratio than Lambert's men are currently trundling along at.

Given all this, it is miraculous Villa aren't in the relegation zone. But, with a safety margin of just three points at the moment, it may only be a matter of time unless they can find their shooting boots.
