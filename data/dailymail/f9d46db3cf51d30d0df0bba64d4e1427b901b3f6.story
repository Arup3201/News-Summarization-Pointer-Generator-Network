A 41-year-old Asian elephant has died from constipation at a Florida zoo.

Maude collapsed and passed away in less than a minute during a Wednesday morning treatment session at Zoo Miami.

A necropsy revealed her digestive tract was packed with sand and clay.

Veterinarians began treating Maude last week when she showed signs of severe digestive impaction, CBS Miami reported.

While elephants normally produce up to 400
 pounds of feces a day, Maude stopped having bowel movements and eating. 

Top veterinary 
specialists tried a variety of treatments ranging from 
wheat bran to IV fluids.

It was during one of those treatments that the pachyderm collapsed.

A partial necropsy revealed her intestine was packed with sand and clay.

While vets say elephants in the wild eat these natural minerals, the combination proved fatal for Maude.

'It was very abrupt, very traumatic for 
everyone. Elephants are very charismatic, theyâ€™re considered very 
intelligent animals. Thereâ€™s something magnificent about them,' 
zoo communications director Ron Magill told Miami Herald.

Magill said Maude's arthritis contributed to her constipation as it was difficult for her to move around.

A more thorough necropsy will be undertaken.
