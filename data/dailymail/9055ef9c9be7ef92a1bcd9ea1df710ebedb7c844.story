As Lance Armstrong pleads for a second chance after his bombshell doping admission, his stepmother is calling him a hypocrite for refusing to forgive the sins of his own father.

Rebecca Gunderson, whose husband Eddie was Lance's biological father, alleges her husband tried to apologize to the son he never knew before his death in 2012 but Lance was unyielding and refused to hear him out.

As critics line up to throw stones at Armstrong, he spoke out on Wednesday for the first time since his Oprah interview, complaining that he is taking the fall for the sport's doping crisis.

Estranged: Lance Armstrong was adopted by his mother's second husband after his biological father Eddie Gunderson, right, divorced his mothers in 1973. Eddie died in 2012 having not seen his son since the 1970s

Armstrong revealed that he had used performance enhancing drugs to secure his seven Tour de France wins, in an interview with Oprah that aired on Jan. 17 and 18.

He was in Hawaii when the interview was broadcast and has mainly stayed under the radar amid the media storm.

He has apologized to the staff at his cancer research foundation and is seeking forgiveness from disillusioned fans.

But one side of his family is speaking out about the irony of his so-called contrition effort.

Support: Linda Armstrong Kelly, left with Lance in 1999 after Lance's Tour de France victory and at an event in 2009, has supported her son's cycling career and cancer research effort

Lance's stepmother, who has never had a relationship with the shamed cyclist, told the National Enquirer that her husband had tried to make amends with his son before he died at the age of 59 in 2012 but she says Lance showed no willingness to forgive.

Eddie Gunderson married Lance's mother, 
Linda, when she was just 17.

Lance's birth parents divorced when he was two in 1973 after a turbulent and abusive relationship, according to Linda.

Linda's second husband, Terry Keith Armstrong, adopted Lance and raised him as his own until Lance's teenage years when Linda and Terry divorced due to Terry's infidelity.

Team Lance: Lance Armstrong said his former wife Kristin, left in 2001, and his current girlfriend Anna Hansen, right in 2011, were supportive of his interview with Oprah

At the height of his son's career, Gunderson pursued a relationship with the cyclist but Lance was not interested.

'I
was his worst supporter. I didn't want him to win at all' the spurned 
father had said in 2010, about not supporting his son in the Tour de France, 
according to an article by French reporter Françoise Inizan in Le 
Temps.

But now, Gunderson's wife said her husband desperately had wanted to reconcile with Lance.

'He
tried to apologize to Lance but Lance always refused to meet with him.
I saw Eddie cry over this many, many nights. His last wish was to see 
Lance once before he died, but that never happened,' she told the tabloid. 

'Lance's
dad deserved a second chance too but his son never gave it to him. And 
now that Eddie's dead, it's too late,' Rebecca Gunderson added.

Coming clean: In a bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey, Lance Armstrong admitted that after years of denying it, he did in fact take performance enhancing drugs to secure his 7 Tour de France wins

With attention being paid to his family, Lance Armstrong has said that they were supportive of his choice to go public with his past in an shocking confession on the Oprah Winfrey Network.

'They were well aware of what I was doing and going to say. They loved the interview. I was in Hawaii when it aired but my older kids and [first wife] Kristin watched both nights live. We spoke immediately after both shows. What was said then I'll keep to myself.' he told Cycling News in his first interview since the January television event.

In an attempt to move forward, Armstrong is now calling for the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to deal with the doping crisis in cycling.

He suggests that the commission offer amnesty to riders and officials who come clean as the 'only way' to understand the scope of the issue and effectively deal with the problem.

'We all made the mess, let's all fix the mess, and let's all be punished equally,' he added.

Harsh words: Armstrong called Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) President Pat McQuaid pathetic and accused him of just trying to cover his own tracks in the wake of the cyclist's doping admission

'Publicly lynching one man and his team will not solve this problem,' he said, alluding to the suspected widespread use of drugs in the sport.

'My generation was no different than any other...the fact remains that our sport is damn hard, the Tour was invented as a 'stunt, and very tough mother f*****s have competed for a century and all looked for advantages.'

'No generation was exempt or "clean,"' he said in his defense.

Mr Armstrong also dished out some harsh words about the commission that regulates cyclists, Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) saying its current head, Pat McQuaid, is inept.

'Many months ago I said, "Pat, you better think bold here. A full blown, global, TRC is our sports best solution." He wanted to hear nothing of it.'

'Pat is just in constant CYA (Cover Your Ass) mode. Pathetic,' Armstrong said, adding that 'The UCI has no place at the table' in creating an adequate solution.
