A van driver who killed a senior RAF officer when he knocked him off his bike has been found guilty of death by dangerous driving.

Group Captain Tom Barrett, who served as a personal aide to the Queen, was hit with such force by Paul Luker that he was propelled into a cycle lane on the other side of the road.

Luker, 51, was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving at Harrow Crown Court, a Scotland Yard spokesman said.

He ploughed into Group Capt Barrett as he rode home from his base along the  A40 near RAF Northolt, in west London, in March last year.

Group Capt Barrett had fought in Afghanistan and Iraq and had also served as aide-de-camp to the Queen, chaperoning her on tours.

Police said Group Capt Barrett, a Station Commander at the base, was cycling towards his Buckinghamshire home during rush hour on March 10 last year when he was struck from behind by dry cleaning delivery driver Luker.

Swedish-born Group Capt Barrett, who had been a keen cyclist and president of the RAF Triathlon Association, was taken to St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, in a critical condition but died later that night.

A postmortem examination revealed the father of two daughters died of multiple injuries.

Chief Superintendent Julian Worker of Hillingdon Police said: 'I knew Tom through working with him and the RAF. He was a committed member of the Safer Hillingdon Partnership.

'He was extremely well respected, charismatic and had one of those very sunny dispositions. I found him energetic and always seeking to engage with the local community, including through actively hosting events at RAF Uxbridge (before closing) and at RAF Northolt.

'He was fiercely proud of his country and the RAF. He will be sadly missed.

'My thoughts are with his wife, children and family to whom, on behalf of Hillingdon Police, I send our condolences.'

After his death, military chiefs also paid tribute to their 'much loved' colleague.

Air Vice Marshal Phil Osborn of 2 Group said: 'Group Captain Barrett was an officer much loved and respected by all with whom he came into contact. Our sympathies are with his family at this difficult time.'

Wing Commander Jules Stilwell, Officer Commanding 32 (The Royal) Squadron, said: 'Tom was an extraordinary person. We were privileged to have had him as our Station Commander and the Royal Air Force is a poorer place without him.'

Group Capt Barrett was awarded an OBE by the Queen in 2008 for his operational work. He was posted to RAF Northolt as Station Commander in September 2009, a role in which he also served as aide-de-camp to the monarch.

Luker, of Farnham Royal, Slough, will be sentenced on March 26.
