A 7-year-old boy has raised more than $50,000 so his best friend who suffers cerebral palsy can have a life-changing operation that will help him walk.

Quinn Callender, from Maple Ridge in Canada's British Columbia, decided to set up a lemonade stand to aid his fellow Beaver Scout Brayden Grozdanich, also 7, outside a grocery store.

But the child's parents amplified the humble fundraiser, reaching millions more thanks to a crowdfunding campaign - and the response was overwhelming, allowing the brave Brayden to book in for surgery.

Brayden undergoes painful physiotherapy on a daily basis to help him walk, but the surgery will allow him to walk without braces.

However, it's only available in New Jersey, his father, Travis Grozdanich, told the CBC, and will cost them $20,000 because they have no U.S. insurance.

But Quinn, who found this out at school one day, wanted to help make it happen.

'When I got home, I wanted to tell my mommy and daddy that I wanted to do a lemonade stand to help raise money to help him,' Quinn told the network.

'He built (a lemonade stand) out of cardboard, and I said "let's think bigger than that,"' Quinn's mom Heather Roney, said. '"Let's go bigger."'

'My Buddy Brayden' was launched on You Caring earlier this month with the goal of raising the $20,000 needed for the operation.

As of Monday evening, the donations sat at $52,051.

In his explanation on the page, Quinn says Brayden's Cerebral Palsy 'makes it challenging for him to walk well because his muscles are very tight. Sometimes he can't keep up with the rest of the other Beavers and he falls down a lot.'

Quinn goes on: 'Brayden get's daily physio therapy to keep him walking. Sometimes it really hurts him. When I was at his physio, I tried to keep Brayden calm when he was in pain.'

The surgery should help release the muscle tightness and spastic action, he adds.

Quinn's heartfelt message concludes: 'Please help me raise money to help my friend Brayden, he is a really good guy.'

Travis Grozdanich, a firefighter, said a different the type of surgery is available in Canada, but it could leave his son wheelchair bound.

'In Canada, the surgery is more invasive than it is in New Jersey,' he told CBC. 'In New Jersey, there's the possibility he'll be walking out the hospital that same day.'

On Sunday, the boys manned the lemonade stand outside their local grocery store, wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan 'when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.'

Unsurprisingly, the entire community showed up to support the boys and the drink was a hit.
