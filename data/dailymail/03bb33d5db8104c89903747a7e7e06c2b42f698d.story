A bride-to-be has postponed her wedding so that she can afford to pay for the treatment of her sick pet lizard.

Teacher Lizzie Griffiths, 25, is so smitten with her adopted bearded dragon George that she has spent her complete £3,000 wedding fund on pioneering cancer treatment for him, without which he would have had to have been put down.

Lizzie lost her heart to George when she spotted him at a rescue centre last year. But after a few months she was devastated to find he had a tumour growing on his face.

Devoted: Lizzie Griffiths has spent her £3,000 savings on cancer treatment for her pet lizard George

She paid for it to be removed twice, but it kept growing back.

Now she has spent her £3,000 savings on a new treatment – chemotherapy for lizards. George is thought to be the first bearded dragon in the UK to have radiotherapy.

Lizzie has been travelling 100 miles from her home in Purley, Surrey, so that George could have regular treatment at the Animal Health Trust in Newmarket, Suffolk.

She has now been told that the cancer is in remission and George is likely to make a full recovery. Bearded lizards usually live for up to 15 years.

Happy companions: When they met, lizard George burrowed into Lizzie's neck - and they've been the best of friends ever since

Maternal instinct: Lizzie worries about lizard George as if he is her child and would do anything to make him better

Lizzie says there in no questions that she would put the health of the reptile before her marriage to boyfriend of ten years, Chris Fisher.

'When I first held him, he burrowed into my neck and it was like he was saying he had found his new home,’ she said of the lizard.

'Now I wake up at half five in the morning just so we can have a cuddle because, if I don't get much time with him, it upsets me.'

She said during his treatment she worried about George as if he were a sick child.

'You would do anything to make a sick child better and it is like he is my child,' she said.

Luckily fiancé Chris is also an animal lover. 'They definitely have a special bond. I understand he is her number one,' he said.
