Ever caught your boyfriend swiping away on his phone late at night and thought nothing of it? He could well be perusing potential new girlfriends on Tinder, if the latest research is anything to go by. 

A new survey revealed that a fifth of people aged 18-35 have secretly used dating websites behind their partner’s back while in a relationship.

According to a new study, 21 per cent of coupled-up people between the ages of 18 and 35 have used dating apps/websites without their partner’s knowledge. 

What's he up to? A new survey reveals that a fifth of men have admitted to using dating apps whilst in a relationship

Respondents were initially asked ‘Have you ever used dating websites?’ to which 58 per cent said that ‘yes’ they had, whilst the remaining respondents claimed not to have done so.

They were then asked ‘Have you ever used a dating website or app whilst in a relationship?’ to which 21 per cent of all respondents said that ‘yes’, they had in the past.

A further 14 per cent, one in seven, admitted that they had used a dating website or app while in their ‘current relationship’. 

The most commonly used dating websites amongst those in relationships were Plenty of Fish (43 per cent), followed by the dating app Tinder (37 per cent) while 29 per cent even paid to be members of Match.com.

The respondents who had admitted to indulging in a spot of online dating were then asked if they had ever actually met somebody whose profile they had seen, which revealed that 44 per cent of these had done so behind their partner’s back.

However, the majority (56 per cent) said that they’d only used the dating website or apps to ‘look’ or ‘message people’ and didn’t actually intend to meet anyone. 

Those who said that they’d actually gone on to meet someone via a dating website or app while in a relationship were asked how far this had gone. Some 39 per cent said that they hadn’t cheated or had sexual contact with the person.

However, 27 per cent confessed that they had been intimate and ended up in bed with the person.

When broken down between male and female respondents, males were shown to be more likely to use dating websites or apps while in a relationship, making up 61 per cent.

The potential cost of dating websites was then looked at, as respondents were asked ‘Have you ever paid for a subscription to a dating website or paid to download a dating app?’ to which 48 per cent said they had. 

They were then asked if they worried about the payments appearing on their bills; 37 per cent admitted to harbouring concerns , but 41 per cent said that they ‘hadn’t thought about it’.

Finally, respondents were asked whether or not they felt guilty about using a dating website behind their partner’s back, with 56 per cent saying that they did. However, the remaining 44 per cent claimed not to feel guilt, with 38 per cent of these saying that it was in their best interest to ‘shop around’.

That's worrying! Of those who do use dating apps and sites, 44 per cent go as far as to meet up with the person and 27 per cent have even ended up in bed with the

A spokesperson for vouchercloud.com, who carried out the research, said: 'Dating websites and apps are becoming increasingly mainstream. A few years ago, dating online was seen as the preserve of geeks and the hopeless.'This certainly isn’t the case now, with more and more people investigating relationship options via the internet.

'The anonymity of online dating though seems that it could be of benefit to those with a wandering eye. It’s much easier to connect with someone discreetly online then it is to do so in a public place. 

'Those who worry that they’re in a relationship with a potential philanderer though might want to take the odd peek at bills if they’re concerned, as it seems that a good percentage aren’t savvy enough to cover their tracks.'
