Frustrated Sydney commuters were forced to walk to work in the rain as three separate accidents caused traffic chaos across the city on Thursday.

Three of the most major routes into the city went into meltdown creating delays, lane closures and diversions for motorists during peak hour this morning.

An unwell driver flipped his car in the citybound tunnel of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel after driving into a safety wall. The man, in his 50s, was not seriously injured, The Daily Telegraph reported.

Motorists had all the time in the world to tweet evidence of their hell trip into work

'Unfortunately it would appear he misjudged and entered towards the end of the break-down lane and drove up a safety wall which flipped the car onto its roof,' police told the Sydney Morning Herald.

However the incident caused a domino effect with lane five on the Warringah Freeway also closed to clear the traffic, which resulted in a traffic jam as far back as 9km snaking all the way to the Lane Cove Tunnel and to Seaforth in the north.Â

The Great Western Highway copped two accidents with a truck fire causing road closure in both directions at Mount Boyce for almost nine painstaking hours from 2am, and a car flipped at Emu Plains disrupting the westbound lanes for 90 minutes in peak hour.

To add to the traffic drama of the morning, a three car pile-up on the M4 motorway at Orchard Hills caused moderate traffic following the closure of a westbound lane.

Meanwhile southbound lanes of the Pacific Highway at Coolongolook were closed off from 5am after a 25 year old male pedestrian was killed by a truck at about 5am.

Commuters abandoned all forms of transport and walked to work in the rain as delays were so bad

Traffic was banked up for 9km north of the CBD

NSW Ambulance services told the Daily Telegraph that 40 calls relating to traffic incidents were made this morning, with 22 of those from the Sydney city area.

Angry drivers were left to vent their frustration on social media, with student Matt Cameron tweeting: Exam starts in 5 minutes and I'm still stuck on the #warringahfreeway #sydney #traffic #nightmare'.

Other commuters reported delays of over 90 minutes on public transport, and one driver claimed she moved just 7km in one hour and 45 minutes en route to the city across the Harbour Bridge.

It took emergency services three hours to reopen the southbound tunnel
