In Fine Style: The Art of Tudor and Stuart Fashion features a 400-year-old waistcoat and jacket reportedly worn by Charles I

A new exhibition in Buckingham Palace proves that the Stuarts were in a league of their own when it came to power-dressing.

In Fine Style: The Art of Tudor and Stuart Fashion is the latest exhibition in the Queen's Gallery and brings garments from the 16th and 17th centuries together with paintings from the same era to convey how trends and attitudes towards fashion have changed over the years.

This exhibition explores in fine detail the costume of British monarchs and their court during the 200-year period through the carefully preserved items of clothing and portraits borrowed from the Royal Collection.

The collection follows the changing styles over the time and, with items rich in lavish embroidery or boosted by dramatic shoulderpads, clearly portrays how clothing was used to depict status - a kind of power-dressing for the Royals, if you like.

Including works by Hans Holbein the Younger, Nicholas Hilliard, Van Dyck
 and Peter Lely, the exhibition brings together more than 60 paintings, as 
well as drawings, garments, jewellery, accessories and armour.

The star of the show is a 400-year-old ladies' waistcoat with floral embroidery, which is in near-perfect condition.

The garment, which dates from the reign of James I, would have been treated like a family heirloom, said Anna Reynolds, who curated the exhibition.

Speaking to the Telegraph, she said: 'Fashion was just as important back then as it is now, if not more so.

'They would be used to make a statement, and people's attitude to clothes was very different from today,'

She explained how even the most simple item such as a white shirt would go through around 20 different processes before it was complete and would then have to be bleached in the sun for a further seven months.

Royal treasures: Queen Mary's patch box, circa 1694

Golden delights: Locket containing hair of Charles I made from gold, enamel, Burmese rubies and diamonds circa 1620 with later additions

'Clothes were passed from person to person [...] and it would have been considered an honour to receive a second-hand item as a gift from someone.'

Another item featured in the exhibition is a brown and green cord jacket which was reportedly worn by Charles I.

The item was lent to the exhibition by a Lincolnshire family whose ancestors passed it down to them after they were given it by the king himself.

There will also be portraits of Elizabeth I as a young princess, painted in 1546 by William Scrots, which Windsor Castle will loan.

Wearing that particular dress for an official portrait, was Elizabeth's way of making a clear political statement about her lineage, which was disputed by many courtiers.

A key theme of the exhibition will be the use of different layers of clothing, partiuclarly 'stays'- undergarments stiffened with whale bone and reed to shape the bust area - a style seen in Woman at her Toilet, 1663, by Jan Steen which will also be on display.
