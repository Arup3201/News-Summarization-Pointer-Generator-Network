George Richards, a former trainee teacher who turned his flat into a prison for children and tried to snatch two little girls has been jailed

A former trainee teacher who turned his flat into a prison for children and tried to snatch two little girls has been jailed.

George Richards, 29, blacked out all his windows and placed bolts high on the doors so youngsters would not be able to escape.

He then tried to abduct a 10-year-old girl on a footbridge on September 12 last year but fled after being shouted at by an off-duty police officer.

The following Monday, he went to a cul-de-sac and grabbed a five year old girl from her doorstep before running off when her mother intervened.

Officers found him nearby and when they approached he held a fake gun at them, but was eventually arrested.

Richards, who is from Ware, Hertfordshire, was found with a kitchen knife, tape and two lengths of string on him.

Officers also found a newspaper clipping of murdered schoolgirl Millie Dowler at his flat.

Richards pleaded guilty to two counts of child abduction, using an imitation firearm and possessing a knife on January 23.

He was sentenced to life and given a minimum term of seven years in jail at St Albans Crown Court on Friday.

Passing sentence, Judge John Plumstead said: 'The level of danger you represent to the public is enormous.

'I am perfectly sure you were intent on abducting and sexually assaulting, or worse, helpless children, but you lost your nerve.'

Richards was jailed for three years at the Old Bailey under the name Luke Sadowski in 2003.

He had arranged to buy a child from Eastern Europe for Â£250 from FBI officers in a sting operation at a London hotel.

A search of his university room that year found a safe full of handcuffs, leg shackles and a gun, amongst other paraphernalia.

Dante Leccacorvi, defending, said Richards was trying to 'goad' police, saying he was concerned he was being followed by authorities.

A statement from the Ware victims' families, said: 'As you can imagine, we have all been through an extremely difficult and traumatic time.

'A stranger came into our lives through no fault of our own, turned them upside-down and changed them forever.

'This is not something we ever expected to happen to our families or would ever want to happen to any other families.

'The man who did this is dangerous and, whilst knowing he is now in prison, may help us in some way to rebuild our lives.

'We have also been sentenced to living with these awful memories forever.'
