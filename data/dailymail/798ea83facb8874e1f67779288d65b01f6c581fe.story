Under scrutiny: Ken Livingstone earned the money from personal appearances, speech making and hosting a radio show

Ken Livingstone used a loophole to avoid £50,000 in tax, despite having attacked tax avoiders in the past as ‘rich b******s.’

Companies House documents show that Labour’s London mayoral candidate earned £232,000 in 2009, the first year after his defeat to Boris Johnson.

The money was earned from personal appearances, speech making and hosting a radio show.

It was paid into a personal company set up by Mr Livingstone and Emma Beal, his then partner who is now his wife.

The pair are sole shareholders in the company, Silveta Ltd.

Accountants told the Sunday Telegraph that the move appears designed to ensure that Mr Livingstone paid corporation tax at 20 or 21 per cent, rather than income tax at up to 40 per cent.

The move is entirely legal.

Three years ago, Mr Livingstone 
criticised tax avoiders, saying: ‘These rich b******s just don’t get it.
 No one should be allowed to vote in a British election, let alone sit 
in Parliament, unless they pay their full share of tax.’

A spokesman for Mr Livingstone denied he was a tax avoider. ‘No one can actually say Ken has done anything wrong - he pays his tax on his income,’ he said.

Accusations: Tory MP Priti Patel accused Mr Livingstone of 'hypocrisy'

‘Since he has not held elected office Ken has had his own small business.

As thousands of small businesses will tell you, the logical thing to do is to set up a company to handle all the issues.

‘That’s all he has done. He will wind up the company if he is elected.’

Tory MP Priti Patel accused Mr Livingstone of ‘hypocrisy’.

She said: ‘This is another case of Ken Livingstone saying one thing while doing another. How can Londoners trust this man?’

Last night Mr Livingstone told BBC Radio 5’s Pienaar’s Politics show: ‘I’m not avoiding tax. Basically I pay income tax on what is paid for me to my daily expenses. I mean poor old Emma had to spend three years in our attic typing out my autobiography, booking my visits round the world to the mayors of all over the place and it’s a very demanding job.

‘But the other thing is, you know, I’ve used that to pay for other people to work on the campaign for Mayor and so on, and I don’t think that anyone really in Britain pays income tax on the money they use to employ other people to work for them.’
