Ten border control staff were caught harbouring illegal immigrants while supposedly protecting the UK, it emerged today.

In the past four years almost 60 UK Border Agency workers committed offences relating to their job.

In the latest scandal to hit the agency, figures revealed that ten staff members were found to have protected illegal immigrants since 2008.

Another 39 staff had been disciplined for abuse of position in relation to immigration misconduct and a further eight cited for organised activity.

It has been revealed that 57 UK Border Agency workers committed offences relating to their job - including harbouring illegal immigrants

MigrationWatch called on tougher penalties for those caught after it emerged that only 23 of the 57 had been dismissed - and six let off completely.

It is the latest in a series of damaging blows for the body charged with protecting Britain's borders.

UKBA came under fire last year when it emerged that vital checks for criminals and terrorists were abandoned over the summer to help prevent congestion for holidaymakers at airports.

Passport checks were relaxed nearly 2,500 times at airports this summer, according to leaked UK Border Agency emails.

Speaking about the disciplinary  figures, Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, said: 'This is potentially very serious. It is a clear reminder of the importance of keeping a watchful eye on border agency staff.

'We must be able to rely on those who protect our borders. For a start, tougher penalties are essential whenever wrong doing is discovered.'

The statistics, released by the Home Office under the Freedom of Information Act, showed immigration offences committed by UK Border Agency staff since 2008.

The agency, which employs 23,000 staff 
around Britain, is charged with keeping our borders tight and stopping 
the entrance of illegal immigrants.

Yet ten employees were caught 
harbouring illegal immigrants, 39 found abusing their position and eight
involved in organised immigration activity.

More
than half of those caught - 32 - were in Greater London, seven in the 
southeast, three in the Midlands, one in the northeast and one in the 
northwest.

There was no location disclosed on 13 of the offenders of the crimes - 22 of which happened in 2010 alone.

A total of 23 of the employees were sacked for their misdemeanours. Bosses gave a final formal warning to 19 and a first formal warning to nine.

Six staff were let off without any form of punishment.

Theresa May was accused by Brodie of blaming him for 'political convenience' over the border control fiasco

Reacting to the figure, the UK Border Agency said it took 'swift action' when employees were found breaking the law.

A
spokesman said: 'We expect the highest standards of our staff and the 
vast majority carry out their roles with professionalism and integrity.

'Any allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated and we take swift action when staff break the law.

'We have a dedicated unit of trained officers who work in close co-operation with the police to investigate any alleged criminality.

'We always refer allegations of corruption to the police.'

Earlier this month The Commons Home Affairs Select Committee today urged a root-and-branch reform of the way the Home Office and UK Border Agency interact in order the make the agency fit for purpose.

MPs said a 'highly-troubling' string of communication failures led to the UK's border checks being relaxed too frequently.

The scandal cost the head of the agency, Brodie Clark, his job.

He admitted using guidance designed for health and safety emergencies to suspend fingerprint checks at the UK's ports in action which had no ministerial authorisation.

When the fiasco came to a head Mr Clark accused Home Secretary Theresa May of blaming him for 'political convenience', before quitting his post after 40 years at the Home Office.

Damning documents also showed that thousands of passengers on private aircraft did not face passport checks at all.

They also showed that fingerprint checks on foreign nationals who need a visa to enter the UK were relaxed on 164 occasions.

Officials were also told to stop 'routinely checking' children from the EU 'against the Warnings Index', which is designed to weed out possible terrorists and criminal gangs.

In one email, a UKBA official at Durham Tees Valley Airport raised concerns with managers, complaining: ‘We are not allowed to physically see the passengers arriving on private charter flights.

'It is creating a situation where we are not able to secure the borders as robustly as we would like, for no justifiable reason.’
