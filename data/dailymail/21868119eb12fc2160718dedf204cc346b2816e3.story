David Haines, who was beheaded in a gruesome video released by ISIS after being kidnapped by the terror group 

The teenage daughter of murdered British hostage David Haines has said her father would have been touched by all the messages of support her family have received.

Mr Haines daughter Bethany has broken her silence and spoke out after her father was beheaded in a gruesome video released by the British Islamic State terrorist who has been dubbed 'Jihadi John'.

The 44-year-old, from Perth in Scotland, had been in Syria working for French aid agency ACTED when he was kidnapped.

On Saturday, ISIS released a video purportedly to show the beheading of the British aid worker.

The video provoked outrage, with Prime Minister David Cameron calling Mr Haines a 'British hero', dedicating his life to promoting peace in places of violent conflict and oversaw projects to save civilians from land mines.

And writing on a Facebook page dedicated to her father, Bethany posted: 'Hi, I'm David's daughter who lives in Perth.

'I was really touched by the messages of support during this hard time I know my dad would be really touched and grateful.'

It comes after Mr Haines brother Mike had to break the news to the 17-year-old that her father had been killed.

Miss Haines was said to have been inconsolable since her father was kidnapped in March last year.

On Sunday, the college student, speaking from the home she shares with her mother Louise, in Scone, Perthshire, said: ‘We’re pulling through.’

While another relative, her maternal uncle, said Bethany was ‘very shocked and devastated’, adding: ‘It’s a very difficult time.’

Mr Haines also had another four-year-old daughter, called Athea, in Croatia, where he was living with his second wife.

Yesterday Mr Haines' brother, Mike, also paid a heartfelt tribute to him and said he was 'murdered in cold blood.'

Born and raised in Scotland, Mr Haines had moved to Croatia to live with his second wife Dragana, 45 (right). They met when she was working as a translator and he wore a kilt at their wedding ceremony

He explained: 'David and I were brought up to know right from wrong, although we might not with the innocence of youth have always chosen right.

‘David was a good brother, there when I needed him and absent when I didn’t. I hope that he felt the same way about me.’

Mr Haines said radicalisation presented a threat to the ‘safety of every person in the world’, adding: ‘Increasingly we are seeing more and more radicalisation in every walk of life.’

The father-of-two had worked for a series of aid organisations after leaving the RAF, including in Croatia, South Sudan and Libya.

His last mission was with the French non-governmental organisation ACTED, the Agency for Technical Co-operation and Development, which works to support civilians affected by war.

He was supporting the emergency humanitarian response at a Syrian refugee camp near to the Turkish border when he was kidnapped.

The team was working to improve the supply of water, food and tents for the growing number of refugees.

Meanwhile fears are now being raised for a second British hostage, Alan Henning, who is also being held hostage by ISIS militants.

Mr Henning, a taxi driver from Manchester, appeared at the end of the chilling video, which showed Mr Haines death with Jihadi John pointing a knife at his head - implying he would be next. 

He was making one last trip to Syria to help those caught up in the conflict when he was seized by Islamist militants and paraded in front of cameras in their latest beheading video.

Prime Minister David Cameron, has remained cautious saying of ISIS, 'they are not Muslims, they are monsters' 

The grotesque images sparked immediate demands from MPs and former military commanders for the UK to quickly join international air strikes in Iraq and Syria and not to rule out sending in ground troops.

Last month, videos showing the beheadings of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were also released by the Islamic State.

Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said it was ‘time for retribution’ and to ‘kill their barbaric fighters.’

Lord Dannatt, the former head of the Army, urged Mr Cameron to join international strikes against Islamic State ‘in the strongest possible way’.

Speaking after a meeting of the UK emergency committee Cobra, Mr Cameron remained cautious as he said of IS ‘they are not Muslims, they are monsters’. He added: ‘We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.’
