Internet auction site eBay may only face a £500,000 fine despite one of the biggest cyber attacks experienced by British consumers.

The penalty, which is the limit that can be imposed by the Information Commissioner's Office, would amount to just 2p for each of the 18million users in Britain and 0.00002 per cent of the company's global annual turnover.

The email, home 
addresses, passwords, phone numbers and birth dates of every eBay 
account holder - 233 million worldwide -  are now in the hands of hackers who can pass them on to other criminals.

A message on the eBay Inc homepage yesterday urged customers to change their passwords in the wake of one of the biggest cyber attacks in history

Customers were urged to change their 
account details after the breach, but the site received another 
technological setback overnight because of a dramatic increase in 
traffic, meaning users could not change their passwords.

Online purhcases make up  around one fifth of all credit card spends in the UK and consumers are expected to spend £107billion online this year.

The British Information Commissioner's Office 
said it was monitoring the situation and may be forced to investigate if British details are leaked, used and purchased by criminals.

The body can hand out fines of up to £500,000 to bodies that breach the UK Data Protection Act.

The most they have issued is £325,000, to Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, but also handed a £250,000 fine to Sony.

Christopher Graham, the Information Commissioner, said: 'On the face of it, this is a very serious breach.

'What we can be sure about is that if there has been a breach of the UK data protection act, we’ll act firmly.

'This needs to be a wake-up call to all of us. It shows consumers the 
importance of having different, strong passwords for different online 
services.

'It’s a wake-up call to government that the 20-year-old data 
protection laws are showing their age.

'But most of all it’s a wake up to
 businesses. Cyber crime is real. Hacking is real. Responsible companies
 have got to act to keep their customer information safe, and if they 
don’t, they’ll find they’re not just in trouble with the Information 
Commissioner, but they’re in trouble with customers too.

The cyber attack on eBay took place in February and was undetected for around two months, giving hackers access to personal information and other non-financial data.

Even though customers were asked to 
reset their passwords, the breach gave intruders access to other 
information, which is far harder to change.

The company said it is trying to fix the problem and is sending millions of emails to customers in a bid to resolve the issue

Alan
 Woodward, a cybersecurity expert from the University of Surrey said the
 stolen data will already be available for purchase on the Black Market and will be sold for low prices.

He said it will have been uploaded to 'dark corners' of the internet and customers will not be able to retrieve it.

He told Mail Online: 'The personal details will now be on the Black Market and you will not be able to get it back.

'The
 cyber-criminal market has become so widespread that information is very
 cheap. You can now buy credit card details for pennies.

'Criminals can get someones name, address, date of birth, email and passwords for as little as £10.

'There have been so many hacks now that the market has depressed for the last two years.'

He also urged customers to use strong passwords by shying away from words in the dictionary.

'That
 is one of the techniques hackers use,' he added. 'When setting up an 
account you have to ask yourself: "Why do corporations need this data?"

'For example, dates of birth are very valuable to cybercriminals, so lie.'

Alastair
 Paterson, the chief executive of Digital Shadows, a company 
specialising in cyber security, said online criminals were advertising 
'teasers' containing names, date of births and phone numbers to 
potential buyers, who could then purchase the rest of the data.

Advocates of traditional high street shopping have seized on the data breach as a reason to favour bricks-and-mortar shopping.

High Streets Minister Brandon Lewis said: 'The internet has revolutionised the way we shop, increasing choice and competition to the benefit of customers.

'Town centres need to adapt to survive – such as adopting “click and collect” services.

'But the cyber-attack on eBay reminds us of the need for internet security and for consumers to be careful about their passwords. This isn’t a problem that people have to think about when they shop on the high street'.

What personal details were stolen?

Hackers gained access to eBay customers' names, encrypted passwords, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth.

It is unclear whether all, or any, of the details were taken but security experts are warning people to assume the worst.

Are my credit cards details safe?

The firm said that the infiltrated part of the network did not contain any financial details, so in theory, yes.

Will changing my password solve the problem?

Changing passwords will stop hackers from being able to use any login details that were stolen.

However, they could still use names, addresses and birth dates to commit identity fraud.

It’s a good idea to change passwords following any attack such as this. It’s also important to update login details on any sites that use the same password.

If a hacker has your password and email address they could use it to attempt to access other sites that use the same combination.

As a rule, the same password should never be used across different sites.

Should I change my PayPal password as well?

PayPal, which owns eBay, has confirmed its accounts and customers have not been affected by this cyber attack.

However, as a matter of course, it’s good practice to change all related passwords across different sites, including PayPal.

Which countries are affected?

At the moment, we can assume that all eBay customers worldwide will be affected by this breach, until eBay says otherwise.

Is this hack a result of the Heartbleed bug?

When Heartbleed was exposed, eBay announced its customer’s account were secure and had not been affected. This suggests the latest hack is a separate attack.

How did hackers steal the information?

It is unclear how the hackers got hold of the information but eBay said it is working with forensic teams to get an answer to this question.

Why did it take so long for eBay to inform customers of the breach?

MailOnline has contacted eBay for an answer to this question. It is unclear what caused the delay.

Typically, following cyber attacks, a firm will investigate the breach to try and determine how many people are affected, and the severity of the attack, before issuing advice.
