Prince Albert II of Monaco and his wife Princess Charlene put on a public display of affection as they joined in the national celebrations for their patron saint.

The couple, who wed in 2011, left Monaco Cathedral arm-in-arm after attending a service as part of the St Devote festivities.

Earlier they were seen whispering to one another and sharing a joke as they watched a procession from a balcony.

The princess, 36, looked smart in a dark pinstripe pencil skirt and matching jacket while her royal husband, 55, wore a blue suit and red tie.

St Devote's Day is a national holiday in Monaco in remembrance of their patron saint. She was a Christan martyr who was killed and tortured for her faith in the 4th century.

According to legend, Christians saved her body and cast it off in a boat to Africa in the hope that once there she would receive a Christian burial. A dove then flew from her mouth and guided the boat to Monaco where in ran aground and the Saint has helped the principality in times of peril ever since.

In line with the legend, Prince Albert and Princess Charlene took part in an annual ceremonial ritual remembering the Saint's final journey.

They were given torches which they used to set fire to a fisherman's boat like the one the Saint's body was carried on.
