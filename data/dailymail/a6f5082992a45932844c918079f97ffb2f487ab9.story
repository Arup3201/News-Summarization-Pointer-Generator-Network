Eccentric Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli might be deadly in front of goal but he proved that he's not quite so sharp with a pair of scissors and a roll of wrapping paper.

In a hilarious two minute clip the apparently clueless Italian ace is shown how to wrap his Christmas gifts by teammate Carlos Tevez.

But the exasperated Argentine becomes increasingly frustrated as Balotelli continually messes it up and blames being left handed for his failure.

Taught a lesson: Balotelli blamed being left-handed for not being able to wrap his presents

Dab hand: Carlos Tevez wrapped his gifts with ease and attempted to show Mario Balotelli how to do it

Concentrating: Balotelli watches Tevez closely but still doesn't appear to grasp the art of wrapping

Tutorial: The Argentinian asks Balotelli if he understands what he is telling him but the striker appears perplexed

The video, part of a daily Man City video advent calendar featuring some of the Premier League champion's galaxy of international stars taking getting involved in Christmas high jinks, has already been seen by more than 600,000 on YouTube.

Balotelli, who will desperately need to work on his present wrapping skills after becoming a new father earlier this month, watches Tevez as he wraps his present with consummate ease.

Speaking in Spanish, Balotelli asks the 28-year-old if he is going to wrap his presents as well.

But despite a quick Tevez tutorial, Balotelli is unable to master the skill.

Apparently giving up, he sighs: 'You know why, it's because I am left handed.' When asked what the difference is by Tevez, Balotelli replies: 'How can I do this if it's this way around?'

Frustrated forward Carlos snaps: 'Mario, use your head a bit! No wonder people say that you are daft.'

Balotelli replies: 'I'm not daft. Look, it's difficult.'

Clearly the former Inter Milan star was really struggling, in the following days advent offering Carlos Tevez's place at the wrapping table has been taken by England goalkeeper Joe Hart, but Balotelli is still struggling with his gifts and asking for help.

It's likely that Balotelli's gift wasn't intended for his current employer - it was revealed over the weekend that the forward is takingthe club to a tribunal to dispute a £34,000 fine for his poor discipline on the field.

He has something of a reputation for being a little clumsy after famously setting his rented £3million Manchester home alight in 2011 after letting off fireworks in the bathroom.

Other amusing advent offerings from Man City's cameramen include French star Samir Nasri singing a Christmas carol in his native tongue, Aleksandar Kolorov giving a less than tuneful rendition of Jingle Bells and David Silva trying his first ever mince pie on camera.
