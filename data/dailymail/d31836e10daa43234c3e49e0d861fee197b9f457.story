An Islamic radical has branded Australian authorities 'the real terrorists', accusing them of plotting to destroy the religion, while an outspoken Islamist firebrand declared today's anti-terror raids were a 'bogus' stunt  to justify new terror laws.

Off the back of the largest terror raids in the nation's history, controversial Perth preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne wrote on Facebook: 'THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ALONG WITH ITS AUTHORITIES ARE CLEARLY ATTACKING ISLAM AND MUSLIMS!! (sic)'.

He said the Australian government wants to 'destroy Islam by any means...closing down Islamic centres, raiding Muslim houses, arresting active Muslim youth and preachers, intimidating Muslims cancelling their passports... and creating a vibe of fear within the Australian community to make them afraid of Muslims'.  

At the same time, in remarks labelled 'inflammatory' by one moderate Muslim leader, Uthman Badar, the spokesman for the Hizb ut-Tahrir group, said the mass police raids in Brisbane and Sydney were 'just in time to justify the bogus terror threat level rise'.

As members of the Islamic community organised a protest in Sydney tonight claiming brutality against Muslims, community leader Dr Jamal Rifi issued a call for calm, asking members of the community, politicians and the media 'not to inflame the situation by throwing oil in the fire'.

Remarks: Perth preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne (left) and Uthman Badar, the spokesman for the Hizb ut-Tahrir political group, both made the fiery statements this morning. 

Remarks: Mr Badar made his statement after news of the terror raids this morning. 

NSW Police released these images of arrests that were made in Sydney this morning. Fifteen people were detained in NSW. 

Come with us: This arrest, from today's raid, was made in Logan, south of Brisbane. 

Mr Badar (pictured) made the remarks on his Facebook page this morning. 

Dr Rifi, who hosted a succesful 'Muslims for Australia' barbeque, at the weekend, said: 'We all have to invest together fighting anyone who is going to affect the safety and security of all Australians.' 

Both Thorne and Badar today linked the raids to the Abbott government's proposed terror laws.

Thorne said the government would use 'the excuse of "terrorism" to launch a crazy indiscriminating assault against harmless youth who have done nothing wrong'.

Badar said: 'As last as last week the PM and ASIO head were telling us that there was no intelligence of any plans for attacks in Australia'.

'Few days later we wake up to yet more dawn "terror" raids with hundreds of police raiding Muslim homes in Sydney and Brisbane.' 

'Just in time to justify the bogus terror threat level rise and the 'anti-terror' laws which will be tabled to Parliament next week.'

'Once again, we wake up to the sad news of our innocent Muslim brothers being arrested by the Australian authorities, their families being terrorized, their houses being raided, their freedoms being confiscated, their rights abused... This is becoming more than what a sane person can bare.' 

'The Australian government want to destroy Islam by any means, and they know that they can't do so by attacking it directly, so they resort to closing down Islamic centres, raiding Muslim houses, arresting active Muslim youth and preachers, intimidating Muslims, cancelling their passports, restricting their freedom, enforcing policies that aim to dividing the Muslim community, and creating a vibe of fear within the Australian community to make them afraid of Muslims, and therefore, they will face no opposition when it comes to passing these new terror laws or arresting innocent Muslims...

'The Australian government is practising institutional terrorism. Its authorities are the real terrorists.

'We ask Allah to destroy those who plot against us, and to keep their harm away from us. Ya Allah look after your obedient servants and protect them from the harm of this government. Ya Allah this government and its authorities have felt safe from your punishment and therefore unleashed their wrath against the innocent harmless Muslims, O Allah so please deal with them according to your justice, and substitute them with others who are less harmful to your religion and its followers.'

He continued by saying it was the 'same thing (former Prime Minister) John Howard did' in 2005 when terror raids also took place.

Nine men were arrested as part of Operation Pendennis in 2005, which found Australian jihadist cells were amassing equipment to use in a terrorist attack on Australia.

Muslim leader Dr Jamal Rifi told Daily Mail Australia those remarks were 'inflammatory' and 'totally premature' given those arrested have not faced court.

Dr Rifi said: 'Anti terror raids are really serious matters, and I believe in the professionalism of our security agencies.

'Such a raid shouldn't be taken lightly and I have no doubt that if there isn't enough sufficient evidence, arrest warrants would not be given for such raids.'

He said those arrested were entitled to the presumption of innocence and a fair hearing in a court of law.

'Any arrest will be tested in the court of law and we have full confidence in the judiciary systems.'

'We are lucky to be living in the country where the judicial arm will not be influenced by the executive arm of the government - and we (should) just have to wait before making such inflammatory remarks.' 

Badar said in his post that it would be a 'tough week' for the Muslim community but agreed that the presumption of innocence needed to be upheld. 

'It's the government that needs to be interrogated here to prove its claims, not those being made examples of,' he said. 

He issued a follow up statement this morning labelling the timing of the raids as 'suspect'.

'The timing of these raids is suspect indeed. With the "anti-terror" laws, which hit a wall in the community, to be tabled to Parliament next week and with "military intervention" imminent in Iraq, these raids are very timely for the government and its propaganda campaign for the same.'

Today's raids, which occurred at dawn in suburbs in Sydney and Brisbane, involved 800 police in New South Wales alone.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott and outgoing ASIO chief David Irvine announced Australia's terror alert level would be raised to 'high' - meaning an attack is likely - last Friday.
