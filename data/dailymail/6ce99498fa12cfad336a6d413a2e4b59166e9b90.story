Child killer Ian Brady has previously tried to starve himself to death

Ian Brady ‘died’ and had to be resuscitated during the seizure that hospitalised him earlier this year, it emerged yesterday.

The Moors Murderer’s heart stopped for seven minutes and doctors used a defibrillator to revive him, his self-styled mental health advocate has revealed.

Brady, 74, who has been campaigning for years for the right to starve himself to death, was furious when he discovered what had happened, Jackie Powell said.

She claimed the child killer lodged written instructions with staff at high security Ashworth Hospital, in Maghull, Merseyside, where he is being held, that his life should not be saved if he ever lost consciousness.But it is believed that because Brady is classed as mentally ill his wishes were disregarded.

Miss Powell, 47, said Brady collapsed in July while being interviewed by a psychiatrist preparing for his appearance at a mental health tribunal. It would have been the first time he had been seen in public for almost five decades.

The tribunal was due to hear claims from Brady that he was sane and could be moved to a regular prison, where he would not be prevented from starving himself to death. He has been tube fed against his will for the last 13 years.

Miss Powell told the Sunday Mirror: ‘He (Brady) suddenly started having small convulsions. At first, they thought it was hiccups. Quickly, they grew more severe. Suddenly, he collapsed and went into a full seizure. He lost consciousness for several minutes.

‘Help was called and several doctors and nurses rushed in. His heart stopped. He was dead. That should have been that.

Brady's health adviser Jackie Powell, left, said the child killer should never have been resuscitated, but a relative of victim Keith Bennett, right, whose body has never been found, said he is happy Brady is suffering

‘He had told the hospital years 
earlier he did not wish ever to be resuscitated. He put it in writing. 
They knew that, but still used a defibrillator.

‘He does not recall the seizure and 
was furious that he had been resuscitated. He should be dead. They 
should have let him go. This is the one thing he has always said he does
not want.’

The fall caused Brady, who suffers 
from a degenerative spine condition, to fracture two vertebrae. He was 
transferred from Ashworth Hospital to the University Hospital Aintree, 
six miles away. Brady spent two nights in a private room before being 
driven back to Ashworth.

He has been held at the secure hospital – at an estimated cost of £7.3million – since 1985.

The mental health tribunal had to be postponed until next year because of Brady’s poor health.

Miss Powell was subsequently arrested 
after she told documentary makers Brady had given her a sealed envelope 
to be opened after his death, which would allow Winnie Johnson – the 
mother of Keith Bennett – ‘to find peace’.

Mrs Johnson, who died in August aged 
78 a few days before the programme was screened, dedicated her life to 
finding where Brady and Myra Hindley buried her 12-year-old son, who 
vanished in 1964.

Keith is the only one of the pair’s 
five victims whose body has not been found. Brady and Hindley, his 
girlfriend, lured children to their deaths in the 1960s, torturing them 
before burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor, which overlooks Oldham.

Brady was jailed for life in 1966 
after he and Hindley were convicted of murdering John Kilbride, 12, 
Lesley Ann Downey, ten, and Edward Evans, 17.

In 1985, Brady finally confessed that he had also murdered Keith and Pauline Reade, 16. Hindley died in jail in 2002 aged 60.

Miss Powell speculated that the letter might reveal the location of Keith’s body on Saddleworth Moor.

In August, police responded to 
publicity about the Channel 4 documentary on Brady by raiding Miss 
Powell’s home in Llanelli, south Wales, and arresting her on suspicion 
of preventing the lawful burial of a body.

Officers also searched Brady’s room at Ashworth Hospital but they did not find the letter in either place.

Yesterday a hospital spokesman refused
to confirm or deny that Brady had been resuscitated. ‘We do not comment
on the care of individual patients for confidentiality reasons,’ she 
said.
