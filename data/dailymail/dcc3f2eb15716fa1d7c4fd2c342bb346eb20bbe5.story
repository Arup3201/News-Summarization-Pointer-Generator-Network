Tyson Fury has been charged with misconduct by the British Boxing Board of Control following his behaviour at Monday's press conference with Dereck Chisora.

The two British heavyweights came together in Kensington to promote their upcoming July 26 bout in Manchester but the event turned sour with Fury launching a string of expletives at both his opponent and one of the journalists in attendance.

When the journalist questioned whether Fury had any respect for the sport or the members of the public in attendance, the 25-year-old responded: 'If you don't like the station, change the channel b****.

Let's shake on it: Dereck Chisora and Tyson Fury go head-to-head as they shake hands on a side-bet

Controversial: The press conference was marred by Fury's bad language which he has now apologised for

'This is my show, I do what I want. This is boxing, it isn't tap-dancing. If anybody doesn't like that they shouldn't be here.

'I'm in fight mode, kill-mode. I don't apologise, it is what it is.'

Fury also used less than civilised language when addressing Chisora and in reference to IBF, WBA and WBO champion Wladimir Klitschko, prompting the BBBofC to take action.

'The British Boxing Board of Control considered the behaviour of boxer Tyson Fury at the press conference for his forthcoming contest against Dereck Chisora,' read a statement on www.bbbofc.com.

Attracting attention: The two men are trying to get attention for the fight which has been overshadowed by other sporting events this summers such as the football World Cup

'The stewards have decided to call Mr. Fury before them under Regulation 25 (misconduct) to their next meeting on Wednesday, 13th August 2014 when this matter will be dealt with.

'Failure to attend this hearing will result in Mr. Fury's boxer's licence being suspended.'
