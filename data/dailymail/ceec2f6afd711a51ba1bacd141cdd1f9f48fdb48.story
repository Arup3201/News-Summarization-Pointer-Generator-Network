Bayern Munich defender Holger Badstuber faces another lengthy spell on the sidelines after being told he needs an operation on a thigh injury.

The Germany defender, who has only just returned to action after spending 20 months out with a serious knee injury, pulled up after kicking the ball during Bayern’s 2-0 win over Stuttgart on Sunday.

It was initially thought he had only strained his thigh, but a test on Sunday revealed he had actually torn muscle tendons.

“Of course I’m very disappointed right now,” the 25-year-old told the club’s website.

“But I’m now used to it and I know how to deal with such situations. Don’t worry, I will come back and carry on from where I had got back to after my long injury absence.

“I will not give up.”

Guardiola had praised Badstuber before his injury v Stuttgart

Badstuber had been highly praised by Bayern coach Pep Guardiola for his performances this season, but the Catalan coach will now have to find a replacement for Wednesday’s Champions League clash with Manchester City.

New signing Mehdi Benatia could therefore make his debut against the Premier League champions.
