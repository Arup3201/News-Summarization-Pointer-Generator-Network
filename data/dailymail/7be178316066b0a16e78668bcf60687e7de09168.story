The Brazilian cycling federation says it has suspended national road race champion Marcia Fernandes for two years for doping, virtually ending her chances of competing in the 2016 Rio Olympics.

The federation says the 23-year-old Fernandes, who's also a member of Spain's Bizkaia-Durango cycling team, tested positive for EPO at the Brazilian championships in June.

Also suspended for failing doping tests at the event were Brazil's under-23 national road race champion, Nayara Gomes Ramos.

Marcia Fernandes is unlikely to take part in her home Olympics at Rio 2016, whose stadium is pictured, after testing positive for EPO and having been banned for two years by the Brazilian cycling federation

Two other cyclists, Juliana Jacobs Renner and Patrick Gabriel Oyakaua, were suspended as well.

The federation revealed on Thursday that none of the athletes requested to have their 'B' samples tested.
