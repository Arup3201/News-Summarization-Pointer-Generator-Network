Sir Roy Strong, historian and former director of the V&A museum, says both the Labour and Conservative parties are using 'one nation' rhetoric but neither are suggesting ways out of the 'trashocracy' mess

The Conservative Party must have had a rude awakening last Tuesday. Someone had not only got in through the back door but they raided the holy of holies. They made off with that jewel in the Tory crown, that vision which had carried the party to electoral victory for most of the last century – one-nation conservatism.

What makes it worse is that Ed Miliband, in his landmark speech, had appropriated a mantle which David Cameron believed that he unassailably wore. Alas, no longer!

The Labour Party leader, in words that should have been spoken by the present Prime Minister, gave vent to his passionate belief in a country in which ‘patriotism, loyalty, dedication to the common cause courses through the veins of all, and nobody feels left out’.

Liberally sprinkled with Churchillian rhetoric, he reiterated the phrase ‘one nation’ 44 times, thus reducing the present Government’s Big Society to something akin to an object of universal derision. We have not heard anything like this since some of Margaret Thatcher’s star performances.

Readers might well ask what is the difference between ‘one-nation socialism’ and ‘one-nation conservativism’. What is it anyway?

One-nation conservatism was the invention of Benjamin Disraeli. It was a vision that successfully averted the country from the revolutions and class wars that were to engulf the European mainland.

By the middle of the Victorian period, the effect of the Industrial Revolution had been to create not only a new, immensely rich middle class, but also a wretchedly paid working class, which lived in conditions that can only be described as shocking.

By the late 1860s, working-class men had the vote and Disraeli realised that for the Conservatives to gain government, social reform must be carried through to gain their support.

In this way a line of descent was formed that enabled the Conservatives to accept the Welfare State as created after 1945 and support it until the dependency culture it created as its downside came under attack by Margaret Thatcher.

WE now need to go back and ask ourselves: Is the Britain of 2012 in any way similar to the country as it was in the 1840s and 1850s when Disraeli formulated his ‘one nation’ idea?

What shocked him most in that period was the utterly enormous gaps between the rich and the poor, the haves and the have-nots. As far as I have observed things in my lifetime, all that we have seen is one form of divided society replaced by another.

The industrial revolution, which gave birth to cotton mill towns, such as Mossley, near Manchester, pictured, lay the foundations for a class-divided Britain

Cotton rooms at John Spencer Ltd Cotton Mills of Burnley, fell silent after the industrial revolution but the class system by then was well and truly established

What I am trying to argue is summed up in a comment I overheard one woman make to another at the Royal Opera House: ‘Don’t worry, if you’re short of staff I’ll send some of mine over to help out.’

No, this was wasn’t Downton Abbey. But it is a vivid reflection of the society created as much by New Labour as by the Conservatives over the past 30 years. I don’t think anyone would  challenge the statement that the gulf between the rich and the  poor must be as wide in 2012 as it was 1911.

The old society that was – in effect, swept away that year with the passing of the Parliament Act which curtailed the powers of the House of Lords – was built on a noblesse oblige between classes.

Neither Miliband nor Cameron has offered any vision to take us forward out of this mess

There was the ladder of ascent – working class, lower-middle, middle-middle and upper-middle class, then gentry and then aristocracy. It was a society based on birth and bound by obligation but it was not immutable.

People could and did ascend through 
achievement and education. You can see it in action in Downton, where 
everyone knows their place in a mechanism that by and large worked, 
although there could be dislocation. However, the option was always for 
evolution rather than revolution.

Having
swept that away as feudal and undemocratic, a very different society 
was created by the final decades of the last century.

Its successor, which is everywhere around us, is a society no longer founded on lineage and brought up with the burden of obligation based on inherited Christian moral values, but one whose sole criterion is money and what it can buy.

It has produced what long ago I labelled the new ‘trashocracy’. Money as never before can buy social status, a title if you give enough away and positions on various boards.

The first attribute to get anywhere these days is has whoever it is got money or, if not, does he or she know anyone who has any?

That was not true 40 years ago. Everything is about money: how to make it, how to keep it, how to spend it and how to recruit people who can lay their hands on it.

And so now we come back to Ed 
Miliband who, it was noticeable when asked whether or not he was a 
millionaire, was evasive. Perhaps he too is among those  he accused of 
getting Cameron’s £40,000 tax handout next April.

Miliband
sees the country as being in a wartime crisis situation. But, alas, 
there’s no Maynard Keynes putting together ideas  for a programme of the
kind  that framed the post-war Welfare State. Miliband’s rhetoric was 
great but there was little, if  any, substance.

So how to create this ‘one nation’? There is no money and the country is still borrowing and running up debt at a furious rate. With devolution and adumbrated Scottish devolution, the ‘one nation’ has already fragmented.

Money has meant  that as soon as anyone has made any, the first thing they do is abandon the decaying organs of the post-1945 state. They opt for private healthcare rather than the NHS and private education over the comprehensive system.

They also buy themselves into the property ladder. This increasing gulf is rubbed into those less fortunate by the often thoughtless, extravagant and vulgar lifestyle of those who’ve got it. And there’s little if any sign there of the Victorian fervour of do-gooding or any moral structure in a society that glorifies relativism and the me-me code of ethics.

Neither Miliband nor Cameron has offered any vision to take us forward out of this mess. The best that can be said is that things look a good deal worse on the European mainland.

Any solution, I need hardly write, is seen solely in terms of money. As Margaret Thatcher once said: ‘You don’t solve a problem by throwing money at it.’ The country’s overall malaise goes much deeper, calling for what in times past used to be labelled a reform of society.

The fact that we can’t even think in those terms any longer is an index of how far we’ve slid downhill. It explains why often a younger generation finds any form of committed religious belief weird.

Years ago I recall that great man Sir Isaiah Berlin saying to me: ‘No great men any more.’ Sadly, how true that is.

Benjamin Disraeli's original vision relied on the rich looking out for the poor

That's why Ed Miliband's attempt to recreate it in today's rapacious society is 'doomed to failure'

Neither Ed Miliband nor David Cameron have set out plans to shift away from this money-mad 'mess'
