With expenses scandals still fresh in the mind, cash for questions dominating headlines, and first-class perks all paid for by the taxpayer, it is perhaps not surprising that MPs are not held in the highest regard by voters.

In fact a major poll has confirmed the image that most MPs are only in politics to line their own pockets, revealing that four in five voters do not trust MPs and believe that they put their own interests before others.

The Ipsos MORI survey reveals deep levels of cynicism towards politicians in general, although 51 per cent of respondents said they trusted their local MP.

Public confidence in elected representatives has been declining in recent years, and is markedly lower than in similar surveys in 2004 and 2006.

But it has recovered slightly since its low point in 2009 during the MPs’ expenses scandal, when 76 per cent of those questioned did not trust MPs to tell the truth.

Now 72 per cent concur – up from 60 per cent in 2006 – while 21 per cent said they did trust them to be honest.

As to what the priorities of MPs are, half of the British public (52 per cent) believe they put their own interests first, and 31 per cent say that they put their party first. 

Only one in 12 (8 per cent ) believe MPs put the interests of their own constituents first, and 6 per cent said their country comes first for MPs.

Unfortunately this is almost the exact opposite of what people want MPs to prioritise, with 56 per cent saying they want them to put their country first while 40 per cent want the constituent put first.

Supporters of the UK Independence Party were more likely than other party supporters to think MPs put their own interests first (72 per cent), to not trust MPs in general or their local MP, and were also most dissatisfied with the three main party leaders.

Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI, said: ‘Public cynicism with politics is nothing new, but it looks like it has become entrenched. 

‘Disenchantment with politicians is shared across supporters of all parties – but is noticeably higher among UKIP voters, who seem most unhappy with the current political scene.’
