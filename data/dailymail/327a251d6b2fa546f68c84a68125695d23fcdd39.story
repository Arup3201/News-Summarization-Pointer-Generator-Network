A young mother who kept a diary recording her experimentation with legal highs died after taking a new drug known as 'benzofury' which has since been criminalised, an inquest heard today.

Lucy Simms, 26, was discovered lying dead on her bedroom floor in Southampton, Hampshire after taking APB - also known as benzo fury - to get a ‘buzz’.

Just days after her death the drug, which had been bought on the internet, was listed for reconsideration and has now been upgraded to a Class B substance.

Drug: Young mother Lucy Simms, 26, was discovered lying dead on her bedroom floor in Southampton, Hampshire after taking former legal high APB - also known as benzo fury - to get a 'buzz'

The inquest into the blonde mother-of-one's death heard how she made and took a ‘bomb’ of APB by wrapping the powder up in a Rizla cigarette paper while at home.

Police investigating her death discovered that Miss Simms had kept diaries of her experiments with legal highs and their effects on her body - and she had previously written ‘my heart is going to attack’.

Winchester Coroner’s Court heard Miss Simms’s lover Lloyd Phillips, who ran a store selling legal highs, had given her the drug and was there when she took it on June 3 last year.

He left to spend the night at his own home at around 8pm, kissing her goodbye at the door, and returned as arranged the next afternoon - only to find her body.

A post mortem examination on Miss Simms, who was found lying naked on a nightdress with electrical cables looped loosely around her upper body, had around 80 bruises and abrasions.

Police launched an investigation due to the suspicious circumstances surrounding her death and Phillips was arrested and questioned, but later released without charge.

There were no signs of anyone causing her death.

At
 the time of Miss Simms's death, Phillips was on police bail, preparing 
to take the stand in a retrial concerning the rape of a 22-year-old 
woman.

He was later 
convicted of drugging her before wheeling her unconscious into a London 
hotel and attacking her during a nine-hour ordeal.

Phillips
 was jailed for 11 years after being convicted of two counts of rape and
 four counts of serious sexual assault and pleading guilty to drugs 
charges.

In a statement read
 to the inquest today, Phillips described how he and Miss Simms had 
spent the day before her death relaxing in the garden and she had taken 
the drug.

'As I got closer to the bedroom door I realised Lucy’s bed had been moved and was closer to the door,' he said.

'I could see her lying on the floor. I think I shouted to her to stop messing around and there was no response.

'I stepped onto the bed and as I stepped over onto the other side I realised something was up.

'Lucy was lying still on her back and there were blue marks on her body and her hands were in front of her chest.

'I
 pulled the cover off and saw her eyes were open and blue marks on her 
face. I went to the other side of the bed and went downstairs.

'I was in shock. I had a glass of water. Some of Lucy’s powder was on the side and I turned the tap on and disposed of it.

'I then went outside and left the bag in a bin.'

He then dialled 999 and paramedics and police attended at around 1pm on June 4, 2013.

Toxicology tests showed Miss Simms, had 7.5 microgrammes of APB per litre of blood in her body.

Experts
 said ABP’s adverse effects are similar to those of amphetamines and 
ecstasy, and include elevated blood pressure, raised heart rate and 
hyperthermia.

There were also antidepressants in her system.

Pathologist
 Russell Delaney said: 'Lucy had been experimenting with this drug and 
other drugs and had been keeping a diary of the effects she was 
experiencing.

'She had described having raised heart rate and she had written at one point: ‘My heart is going to attack’.

'Lucy had been experimenting with this drug and 
other drugs and had been keeping a diary of the effects she was 
experiencing'

'It is consistent with what somebody might be experiencing if they were having those signs and symptoms.'

Police Sergeant Gareth Jones said packets of APB 5 and 6 were found in the property, along with Miss Simms diaries of her attempts ‘to create the maximum buzz’.

Miss Simms had a young daughter with her former partner Gary Willoughby, who attended today's hearing.

Hampshire and New Forest Coroner Grahame Short said Miss Simms had ‘fatal levels’ of APB in her blood and concluded she died as the result of an accident.

It was classified as a class B drug on June 10, 2014.

'Having heard all the evidence I am satisfied that on the balance of probabilites the death was caused by very high levels of APB found in Lucy’s body,' Mr Short said.

'There is no evidence any third party forced Lucy to swallow APB, which was believed to be in the form of a bomb.

'There was a lot of evidence Lucy chose to consume it and was experimenting with various drugs to record the effects on her.

'I have read her notes, they are very methodical and she recorded the results of a series of tests and the effects they were having on herself.

'She has described some of the symptoms which were described by others.

'There is no indication she intended to cause her death so I have ruled out suicide.

'This was therefore an accidental death.

'The evidence shows Lucy did not intend to end her life but did not fully understand the effects of the drugs she was taking and the chemical effect of the things she was swallowing.

'This could best be described as an experiment that went wrong.'
