Harry Kane has been named the Barclays Premier League player of the month for the second successive time.

The Tottenham striker scored four goals, including a brace against north London rivals Arsenal and the equaliser against West Ham.

Kane is only the fourth player to win the award twice in a row, joining Cristiano Ronaldo, Dennis Bergkamp and Robbie Fowler.

'Against Arsenal, winning 2-1, and getting both the goals was a special day for myself, for my career and for the club itself.' 

The 21-year-old his sights set on becoming the first man to win the award three months in a row.

He said: 'To make history would be something very special. Obviously I’ve scored a couple so far this month.

'Still a few more games to go, so hopefully I’ll get a few more goals and we’ll see what happens, but I’m looking forward to the games ahead.'

It has been a remarkable rise for Kane who only scored his first Premier League goal at the end of the season but is now third in the race for the Barclays Golden Boot with 16 goals.

Kane said: 'It's happened quite fast but I have always said I had belief in myself. It was just waiting to get the chance and being patient and being ready to take it. I've been able to do that.

'I have loved every minute of playing and have loved my football so much at the moment, playing with my mates, in a great team and a great squad. I am looking forward to the rest of the games.'
