Being the butt of the jokes at a stand-up comedy night is a terrifying prospect for pretty much anyone, even a size eight blonde model. 

But when you're trying to cover up a size 22 figure (26 US), the effect is mortifying. 

For Amy Gordon, 29, from Wolverhampton, the experience was to make completely overhaul her diet.

Amy Gordon, 29, from Wolverhampton has gone from from 18st 5lbs to 9st 7lbs in a year and a half. The dental nurse decided to start dieting after she was the butt of a comedian's jokes during a stand-up show 

She said: 'I was at a comedy show with my mates when the comedian started telling jokes about fat girls and decided to single me out. 

'"Here’s one!" he laughed, pointing at me, sitting in the second row.

'Suddenly all eyes were on me and the laughter grew louder - my night out had turned into a nightmare. 

'"Take no notice. He’s an idiot," my friend whispered, but I was already starting to cry and the brave face I’d worn for a lifetime finally slipped.' 

Amy had always been big - even at school she was a size 20 (16 US), which made her the daily target of bullies. 

As a teenager, Amy had dreaded being invited to theme park outings in case she was too big to go on some of the rides, even though she was just 5ft 6ins tall. 

At Amy's heaviest, she weighed 18st 5lbs (259lbs)  

But by the time Amy reached adulthood, she had found a nice group of friends and a job as a dental nurse that finally made her feel comfortable and confident. 

Until that night in the comedy club. 

She said: 'That night shattered me. From then on, all I wanted was to lose weight. Fast. 

'So I embarked on a starvation diet – the only way I knew to lose weight – and within a few months I’d gone from 17st (238lbs) to 13st (182lbs), then gained it all back again.

'The ‘diet/binge’ cycle lasted nearly 10 years and left me at 18st (252lbs) - bigger than I’d started and utterly miserable. 

Since losing the weight, Amy has dyed her hair blonde and gained in confidence 

'When my boyfriend Andy, proposed in 2010, I lost 4st (56lbs) for the wedding and felt pretty good in my size-16 wedding dress. 

'Two weeks later, after a honeymoon to Kefalonia, I was already 1st heavier and within two months that dress no longer fitted.'

Amy's disgust at her weight started to impact on her social life, because she was too embarrassed to be seen in public. 

She said: 'I no longer wanted to go out and I avoided shopping for anything except food. I lived on junk food, ready meals and takeaways.

'My skin was spotty and I had absolutely no energy, the result of a pretty appalling diet. 

'Breakfast was biscuits and coffee when I arrived at the dental surgery where I work. 

'Mid-morning, I’d buy a pasty to keep me going, then for lunch I’d have a cheese baguette, crisps, chocolate and a sugary fizzy drink. 

'After work, I got in the habit of eating four or five slices of toast, then when Andy came home I’d take something out of the freezer for our tea, like a pizza, potato wedges or fried chicken. 

'I’d convinced myself that working full-time meant I had no time to cook.' 

Amy continued: 'The only time I ate vegetables was when we went to my mum’s for Sunday lunch. 

'At Christmas 2012, Andy bought me some beautiful, expensive jeans and tops in a size 22 and none of them fitted. 

'I had no idea what I weighed – years of dieting had given me such a fear of the scales that I no longer owned any – but I was absolutely gutted.'

A week later, Amy signed up to her local Weight Watchers group in Wolverhampton. 

She said: 'I stepped on the scales and my Leader, Dawn Charman, asked if I wanted to know the number. 

Amy hated to go out socialising when she was at her largest, preferring to stay in and watch television 

‘"Yes, I want to face it," I replied, and when she told me I was 18st 5lb (259lbs), I was horrified, but not surprised.' 

Over the next few months Amy completely overhauled her diet. 

Breakfast was a poached egg on toast and for lunch she took salads or soups to work, with a piece of fruit for a snack. 

Then for dinner she would have a Weight Watchers ready meal with salad and cooked vegetables. 

In the first month she lost 1st 7lb (23.8lbs) and could fit into the clothes she was given for Christmas. 

Amy then started to learn to cook and signed up to a gym - by the end of February she had lost another 7lb.  

She said: 'Each week I continued losing weight and by the summer, I was down to 13st 6lb (190lbs).

'By the winter, I was a size 14 - I hadn’t been that slim since I was about 12 years old and I started taking more interest in my appearance, like having my dark hair lightened was a big step. 

'I went on to lose another 7lb and now I’m maintaining my weight between 9st 7lb and 10st (140 lbs).  

'Breakfast is a big bowl of fruit with Weight Watchers yogurt, lunch is a chicken or tuna salad and a packet of crisps. 

'I snack on fruit and in the evening I make a low ProPoints value meal for the two of us. 

'On holiday this year in Tunisia, I wore my first ever bikini – in a size 10 – and, although I still felt a little unsure of myself, Andy told me I looked great.

 'The other day, one of my patients came into the dental surgery and asked, ‘Where’s Amy?’ When I said, ‘That’s me,’ he shook his head. ‘No,the other Amy. The big girl with the dark hair.’ 

'I had to smile, because I’m no longer dark, I’m no longer big and I’m no longer the girl who wears a permanent brave face… but I’m still me.'
