A lamb advertisement aimed at celebrating Australia Day has come under fire for its lack of Indigenous Australian faces.

The new campaign by Meat and Livestock Australia which features cricket legend Richie Benaud was released earlier this month but some have criticised the ad for excluding other ethnic minorities. 

In the ad Benaud, the voice of Australian cricket, calls on the likes of Captain Cook, Ned Kelly and Don Bradman to join him for a knees up at his waterfront home.

The lamb campaign which features iconic cricket commentator Richie Benaud  to promote lamb on Australia Day has come under fire for being racist

There has been mixed reaction to the advertisement on social media, with some criticising it and others praising the hilarity

But speaking to NITV News, social commentator Celeste Liddle said the advertisement was a prime example of what she believes to be wrong with the concept or Australia Day.

Social commentator Celeste Liddle criticised the advertisement 

'To be honest it accurately reflects Australia day and all that's completely wrong with it,' she said.

'By that I mean we've got a bunch of white men who are completely ignoring the fact that there is history in this country that pertains to Aboriginal people and our experiences,' Ms Liddle continued.

However Meat and Livestock Australia have defended their position saying they extended the invitation for many others to join the campaign, and the ad should be taken lightly.

'This chapter of the Australia Day lamb campaign was created to capture the spirit of our national day,' they told Daily Mail Australia in a statement. 

'The bringing together of a group of Australian legends allowed us to honour some of the people who have helped defined Australia, in the most Aussie way possible – by sharing a lamb barbecue together. 

'Meat & Livestock Australia approached numerous people from a variety of cultural backgrounds to be involved in the Australia Day lamb campaign however on this occasion some politely declined or were unavailable.  

'This Australia Day lamb campaign is not intended to offend; rather it is a humorous celebration of some of the legendary figures who have made Australia great.'

Journalist and businesswoman Ita Buttrose (left) was more than happy to accept the invite from the back of her limousine, and explorers Burke (pictured bottom, in right side image) and Wills (pictured top, in right side image) agreed to attend from what looks like the Aussie outback

Social media users have had mixed reviews to the advertisement, many branding it entertaining while others have pointed out the obvious lack of multicultural faces. 

Released earlier in January, the ad sees Beanud take on a new role in the annual Australia Day lamb campaign - capturing the spirits by doing what we believe every Aussies should be doing - organising a big lamb BBQ and a game of backyard cricket.

The Australian icon has joined with 'Lambassador' Sam Kekovich as well as a host of national and historical icons to join him in bringing everyone together to share the most-loved chops and cutlets.

The advertisement opens on an open sea, with Captain Cook aboard his ship as he approaches the Australian shore line. 

His steely focus on the path ahead is interrupted by a phone call from Benaud inviting him to a 'barbie' at his place on Australia Day.

'Cooky' agrees, and asks if fellow explorers Burke and Wills are also on the guest list – they're keen, despite their death-bed-dire situation in a baking hot desert.

Benaud later looks worried when legendary outlaw Ned Kelly offers to 'round up the guys' for the occasion, although this is less worrying than the rumour that Kelly has gone 'veggo' (in fact he is just gluten intolerant). 

Other iconic Australians invited to Benaud's barbie include iconic cricketer Don Bradman, media giant Ita Buttrose, and of course Sam Kekovich. 

But when Billy Birmingham – famous for impersonating Benaud as the 12th Man – gets wind of the lamb feast, he's bluntly told by Benaud that there's nothing on. 

Benaud said: 'In addition to my love of cricket on Australia Day, I wanted to be involved in another key part of our national day, the iconic lamb campaign.

'For me, this year's campaign encapsulates what Australia Day is all about; Australians getting together for a lamb BBQ.'

General Manager Global Marketing at Meat & Livestock Australia Michael Edmonds said: 'As a nation we love our lamb, and it's our belief that you never lamb alone. 

'That goes double on Australia Day. Benaud might not be at the cricket surrounded by his army of fans this year, but he's still making the most of the day and spending it with this pantheon of notable Australians.'
