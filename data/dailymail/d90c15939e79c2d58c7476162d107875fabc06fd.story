John Stones and Luke Shaw will be included in England’s squad for Euro 2015 as Gareth Southgate gets close to formulating his 23-man party.

The coach is ‘certain’ of 21 of the names and his list includes Everton central defender Stones, who was outstanding in the friendly wins over the Czech Republic and Germany, and Manchester United left back Shaw.

Stones went to the World Cup last summer and was a regular in Roy Hodgson’s senior squad at the beginning of the campaign but, like Calum Chambers, he dropped back down with aplomb and will be a key figure in the Czech Republic.

John Stones played in the impressive 3-2 win against Germany U21s and will head to the Czech Republic

Luke Shaw hasn't played for the U21s since October but he will be headed for Euro 2015

Shaw has not played for the Under 21s since the play-off victory over Croatia last October but he was included regularly in the early part of Southgate’s reign.

Everton’s Ross Barkley is expected to have the summer off. The midfielder has never been in one of Southgate’s squads and last played for the Under 21s in August 2013.

England’s first Group B game is against Portugal in Uherske Hradiste on June 18.
