A mother has been sentenced to 10 years in prison over the disappearance of her 18-month-old son.

Zinah Jennings still refuses to tell police where her son Amir, who was last seen 10 months ago, is now - though she insists the boy is safe.

The 23-year-old showed no emotion on Friday as the verdict of unlawful conduct was read at a courtroom in Columbia, South Carolina.

A jury of eight women and four men deliberated for two and a half hours before reaching its decision, and a judge sentenced Jennings to the maximum 10-year sentence.

The defendant had been held without bail ever since her arrest.

The last time Amir was seen was November, when a security video at a Columbia bank recorded them both.

Police say Jennings repeatedly lied to them about where the boy is, telling false tales that led them to search places from Atlanta to Charlotte.

Jennings, who did not testify in her defence, has said she left the boy somewhere safe but would not give details when questioned by police.

Prosecutors played a lengthy police interview in which Jennings cried as she said her son was safe but that she could not prove to detectives that the boy was alive.

Investigators have found Amir's blood on baby blankets retrieved from Jennings' car, but no other trace of him.

Some of the dozens of prosecution witnesses testified during the two-week trial that Jennings - who gave birth to a second child last week - said she was overwhelmed by the stresses of parenting an active, energetic boy and needed a break.

One friend said Jennings told her she pondered selling or giving away Amir, and even mentioned throwing the boy out the window of a moving car.

Other prosecution witnesses testified that they saw Jennings kick Amir when he misbehaved or squeeze his hand when he wouldn't say 'mama'.

Employees at the bank where the video came from testified that Amir was often not in a car seat when his mother pulled up at a drive-through window.

Defence: The boy's grandmother Jocelyn Jennings Nelson told the court her daughter must be innocent

Jennings' mother, however, said that, while she and her strong-willed daughter butted heads when it came to parenting styles, she does not believe her daughter would ever have harmed Amir.

Before sentencing, Jocelyn Jennings Nelson also said she thought her daughter had suffered from post-partum depression and that she tried to find counseling for her after Amir's birth.

'She didn't understand what her body was going through and the impact motherhood was having on her,' Mrs Nelson told the judge. 'At this point, Amir could be anywhere... I will never stop looking for him.'

It was unclear who would care for Jennings' baby girl, though her mother has said she would be willing to do that. Judge Knox McMahon said that Jennings would get all necessary medical care.

In pronouncing sentence, Mr McMahon made it clear that his thoughts were with the boy.

'I also do not know where Amir Jennings is,' the judge said. 'I know where his blanket is. I know where his blood is.

'There's one innocent person, one blameless person, one person that cannot fend for himself in the world we live in, and that's Amir Jennings.'

Mr McMahon also recommended that Jennings receive counseling and ruled that she be credited with the nine months she has already served in jail.
