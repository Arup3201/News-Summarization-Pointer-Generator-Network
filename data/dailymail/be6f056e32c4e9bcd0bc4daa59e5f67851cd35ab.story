'Happy and Caring': Courtney Holdcroft died after being hit by a bus outside her school in Stoke

A 12-year-old schoolgirl was killed after being pulled under the wheels of a bus as she crossed the road to join her friends on the other side.

Courtney Holdcroft suffered fatal injuries after being hit by the single-decker bus - which was travelling at just 19mph - as her friends shouted at her to 'watch out'.

The pupil tried to run out of the path of the bus, but was 'sucked' under the wheels and crushed, an inquest heard.

Courtney was hit by the bus as she left an after-school club at Ormiston Sir Stanley Matthews Academy in Stoke, Staffordshire, on June 13 last year.

The schoolgirl had spotted her friends on the other side of the road and was struck as she attempted to cross and join them.

One pupil said in a statement: 'We told her to watch out for the bus. She tried to beat it but she couldn't and then she got sucked under it.'

Kenneth Harper, 64, a passenger on board the bus, said: 'The bus was coming down the road slowly when two lads ran across the road.

'The driver started to brake a bit, then I saw this young girl hit the windscreen and heard a thud.

'It was just something that happened. It was very out of the blue,' he added.

The 12-year-old, who was described as a 'happy and caring' girl with a talent for music, was taken to hospital by air ambulance but later died from her injuries.

Bus driver Derek Oates, 62, said the tragic accident had left him traumatised.

'I am very sorry, there is nothing that can change what happened. I have been traumatised by it all.'

Courtney’s mother Lyndsay 
Rogers-Coates said at the inquest: 'When we got to the school the air 
ambulance was just taking Courtney to the hospital.

'We were taken into the relatives’ 
room at the hospital where the nurse told me to go and see Courtney as 
she was very poorly.

'When I went in there I was told to say my 
goodbyes.'

Recording a verdict of accidental death, North Staffordshire assistant deputy coroner David James said: 'This was a tragic accident.

'Courtney was a perfectly happy young girl who was sadly confronted with a situation like this.

'The only consolation is that she would not have known about it as she died from multiple injuries including severe head injuries.

At the time of the tragedy the school's principal Mark Stanyer described the 12-year-old as a 'lovely girl who did her best at everything'.

'We were very proud of her and words cannot explain just how devastated we all feel about this tragic accident,' he said at the time.

Up to 1,000 people signed a petition following Courtney’s death calling for a crossing patrol outside the school.

Stoke Council has said it is awaiting a full police report detailing the causes of the accident.
