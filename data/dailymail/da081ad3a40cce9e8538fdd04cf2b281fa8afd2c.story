A grandfather who built a fake bomb and planted it outside a Jobcentre after his benefits were temporarily stopped has been jailed for two years.

William Harkin crafted the device using an analogue clock, wires and tape, before placing it in a brown paper package outside the building in Middleton, Greater Manchester.

Manchester Crown Court heard how the 54-year-old had originally intended to stage a rooftop protest and unfurl a banner over the building, but decided to make the fake bomb instead.

Harkin, originally from Northern Ireland, carried out the hoax the day after the 18th anniversary of the IRA bombings in Manchester. 

It came after his jobseekers' allowance was suspended for three months, after he missed a number of college courses designed to help him get a job.

After planting the fake bomb in June this year, the court heard how Harkin rang police from a nearby phone box pretending to be a concerned passer-by.

Police raced to the scene and cordoned off the area for five hours. An electronic Explosive Ordnance Disposal robot established the bomb was a fake and disposed of it in a small controlled explosion. 

While at the scene, officers found Harkin loitering in the same phonebox from which he had made the emergency call.

He was taken in for questioning where he confessed to the crime. He claimed he was 'upset' that his state handouts were to be halted and said it was an act of 'abject stupidity and foolishness'.

Manchester Crown Court heard Harkin has previous convictions for the same offence in his home country. 

He also has a previous conviction for providing information to a terrorist as part a spate of offences in the early 1980s.  

Passing sentence Judge Leslie Hull told him: 'There was a sense of grievance towards the Department for Work and Pensions for the suspension of your benefits without, what you thought, was just cause.

The scene was cordoned off for five hours after Harkin - who made the hoax bomb out of an analogue clock and wires - phoned 999 pretending to be a concerned passer-by

'What was said about you was that this was a gesture you were making towards them. A gesture it may have been but none of the features which are dealt with justify what you did.

'Part of the menace of what you did is the fact that this would inevitably have been a distraction to the emergency services.'

He added: 'There is a photo of the package which shows an analogue clock face, wires and a good deal of taping together. It may be reported as a realistic bomb. Certainly the emergency services had little option but to proceed upon the basis that it was real.

'The area was cordoned off and there was a degree of disruption. You have convictions recorded against you for similar offences in Northern Ireland and it has not escaped attention that this offence was the day after the 18th anniversary of the IRA bomb in Manchester.

'The courts have to do what they can to deter people such as you from doing this sort of thing.'The court heard that Harkin rang police at around 4.50am to tell them there was a 'suspicious package' outside the benefits agency and gave the address. 

Prosecutor David Lees said: 'At about 5am officers attended and located the phone box from which the defendant had made the telephone call and they found him.

'He pointed out where the device was and they found a brown paper package. Poking through was a full clock fires with wires coming out.

'He said he had been on state benefits for some time and had been on various courses to assist him.

'He had missed some of these courses and therefore the benefits agency had written to him indicating that his benefits were going to be suspended for three months.

'As a result he built the package with the intention of upsetting those who had been there.'

In mitigation, defence counsel Joseph Hart said Harkin had suffered since his mother and wife had died and he felt he had been 'messed about' by the benefits agency.

He said: 'The resentment had built up within him and he wanted to do something to bring home to the authorities his frustration and upset at the way he had been left high and dry.

'His initial thought was to prepare a banner and do a rooftop protest but in the depths of his paranoia and upset alighted on the idea of a bomb hoax.

'He has a distorted and confused image of what he was trying to achieve.

'The anniversary of the bombings wasn't something that preyed on his mind. He doesn't suggest that he has a particular political allegiance.'
