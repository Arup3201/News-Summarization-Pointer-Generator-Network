Katie Ashcraft was booked in to have a caesarian in 10 days time.

Her three previous children - all boys - had arrived in a very organized fashion, and she had time for an epidural with each of them.

So she was in no way prepared for the emergency birth of her fourth child on Thursday.

'Something was different,' she told NBC Los Angeles.

'It was really intense. There was no stopping this one.'

'Intense': Katie Ashcraft gave birth to her fourth child, a baby boy, on Interstate 15 near State Route 56 in San Diego

The mom was en route to hospital after she felt unwell when her husband had to pull over

The baby was delivered by an emergency crew in the back of the couple's pick up truck

NBC Southern California was able to get footage of the scene

The mom gave birth to a baby boy on Interstate 15 near State Route 56 in San Diego.

It was about 2am and she was being driven to UCSD Medical by her husband after suddenly not feeling right.

As the feeling intensified her husband pulled over.

After Ashcraft's water broke, it was a matter of minutes before the baby was crowning and her husband was worried.

'It was complete chaos for about 20 minutes,' she said.

After calling 911 the California Highway Patrol and San Diego Fire Rescue crews arrived in minutes.

The baby - who has not yet been named - was delivered in the back on the couple's pickup truck.

Ashcraft described the pain of the birth as like nothing she has ever experienced

'It was a lot of screaming,' Ashcraft recalled.

'Iâ€™ve never felt pain like that before.

'I don't know how I survived.'

The little boy weighed in at a healthy 10 pounds, 14 ounces.

He was a little bruised up because of the quick delivery.

Ashcraft said she hopes to do something to thank the emergency personnel who helped her safely deliver.
