One of the two men convicted of murdering Stephen Lawrence lost a second attempt  to challenge his conviction yesterday.

Gangster’s son David Norris, 36, was refused permission to appeal by three judges sitting at the Court of Appeal in London.

A previous attempt by Norris to appeal against his murder conviction failed last summer, but yesterday he made a new one.

Gary Dobson, 37, the other man jailed
for life in January last year for Stephen’s racist murder, dropped his 
appeal two months ago.

Stephen, an 18-year-old A-level 
student, was stabbed to death by a gang of white youths who set upon him
at a bus stop in Eltham, South East London, in 1993.

Norris and Dobson were among five 
thugs famously named as his killers by the Daily Mail in 1997. But it 
was only last year, after a forensic breakthrough, that anyone was 
convicted.

Norris was not in court yesterday as his barrister, Tim Owen QC, argued that his conviction at the Old Bailey was unfair.

Mr Owen said the judge should not 
have allowed the jury access to secret recordings of Norris telling his 
racist friends 20 months after Stephen’s murder that he wanted to 
torture and kill black people.

The jury was unfairly biased by 
hearing his client’s racist remarks, because they contained nothing to 
suggest he was involved in murdering Stephen.

Mr Owen also claimed that prosecution
evidence about Stephen’s hair and clothes fibres being found on 
clothing at Norris’s home had changed during the trial, and that the 
defence should have gathered new expert opinion and challenged it.

He said the steps taken by Norris’s 
previous barrister, Stephen Batten QC, to address the fibres issue at 
the trial were ‘inadequate’, and that Mr Batten admitted so.

Mr Owen added that as his client was 
not legally aided, he was requesting £4,000 of public funds to hire a 
new expert to look at the hair and fibres evidence.

But Lord Justice Leveson, sitting with two other judges, dismissed the request for £4,000, and the entire appeal bid.

‘Because of the public interest in this we will produce our reasons in writing and provide them next week,’ he said.
