Thousands of fraud victims have had their cases ignored due to the failure of a new crime hotline.

Action Fraud is writing to apologise to nearly 2,500 people whose crime reports went missing over the past eight months because of an ‘IT fault’.

The blunder will put further pressure on Ministers to improve the nationwide system introduced this year, which means people can no longer report fraud by calling 999 or visiting a police station.

Instead, they must give details online or ring a call centre run by a company handed £2 million of public cash in the past year.

Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) have urged the Home Secretary to carry out a review amid concerns that Action Fraud is not giving victims support, refusing to update them on progress and failing to pass on more than half of cases to police.

The computer problems will also heighten concerns that statistics showing a fall in crime do not fully take into account soaring levels of online scams, most of which are never reported, investigated or solved.

Dorset PCC Martyn Underhill demanded action from Ministers after constituent Jenny Parkinson, 64, lost her £68,000 life savings in a bank scam, saying: ‘The system is flawed because it’s not focused on victims.’

But Action Fraud failed to pass the grandmother’s case on to police, despite the large sum involved, and did not inform her of the decision.

It was only after she went to her local radio station and her PCC got involved that an investigation was launched.

Failure: Action Fraud is supposed to provide a central point of contact for fraud victims but has been heavily criticised

She said: ‘I feel police action is vital or the criminals will come to understand that Action Fraud is toothless and they can continue to rob at will.’

Victims told The Mail on Sunday they felt let down after making reports to Action Fraud. In most cases their banks had already said they would not get their money back because they had voluntarily – if unwittingly – transferred it to fraudsters.

Hollie Watson, a 24-year-old hairdresser from Catford, South London, rang the hotline after giving a £2,000 deposit on a flat to a ‘landlord’ who turned out to be a fraudster.

‘Action Fraud weren’t as helpful as I thought they would be,’ she said. ‘I was constantly ringing them to find out what was happening and they wouldn’t tell me anything.’

She also asked to be put in touch with the charity Victim Support, but they only contacted her six weeks later.

Ludivina Saloma, a 43-year-old nurse from Bedfordshire, paid more than £3,000 for flights to the Philippines to visit her dying father, only to discover the ‘travel agent’ was bogus.

She says Action Fraud told her to go to the small claims court and when she tried to explain her situation, a call centre operator hung up on her.

‘It was really rude,’ she said. ‘We just kept going round and round, she was saying it wasn’t a fraud.’

Online fraud is one of the fastest-growing categories of crime, with official figures last week showing that thousands of people are falling victim to dating scams, in which conmen befriend them over the internet then convince them to hand over cash.

Millions of Britons are also being tricked into giving away bank details and passwords by fake emails, or paying for goods online that never arrive.

Action Fraud was set up in 2009 to gather information on new scams and take reports instead of police, who often lack resources or expertise to solve online scams.

The quango’s budget now stands at £5 million a year, much of which is paid to the firm BSS to run a call centre in Manchester.

BSS started off managing telethons such as Children In Need for the BBC, and also operates a ticket line for the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra.

Complaints: Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne said: 'Action Fraud has taken immediate action to process the affected reports'

Action Fraud received 302,526 reports in 2012-13 but only 40 per cent were passed on to police to investigate. Most reports are included in crime statistics, says the Home Office.

On Friday, Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne admitted that since November last year, 2,490 online reports ‘were not processed correctly due to a fault in the IT system’.

He said: ‘Action Fraud has taken immediate action to process the affected reports and will be writing to apologise to everyone and to make it clear that their report is now being dealt with.’

The Home Office said Action Fraud received 30 complaints between January and March this year, adding that BSS would have to pay to repair the IT system and contact victims following the technical fault.

A Home Office spokesman added: ‘We are constantly looking at ways of improving our effectiveness and we welcome feedback from PCCs and the public.’
