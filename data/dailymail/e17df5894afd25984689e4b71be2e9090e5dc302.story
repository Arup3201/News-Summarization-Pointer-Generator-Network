Rolf Harris's daughter Bindi emerged from court with an apparent smile today moments after fighting back tears when her father was sentenced to five years and nine months in jail.

Bindi Nicholls, 50, has stood by her father throughout his eight-week court case, giving evidence in his defence and holding his hand.

Today, she could not hide her emotion as the judge ordered him to a minimum of three years behind bars.

Rock: She supported her father throughout the eight-week trial, giving evidence and holding his hand

The trial heard Harris 'took advantage' of young girls between 1968 and 1986, including Bindi's best friend.

He ‘got a thrill’ from abusing children, the judge said, and clearly ‘fancied’ his daughter’s best friend when she was 13 and he was 48.

The jury also heard extensive details about Harris's turbulent relationship with Bindi, as the prosecution accused her of supporting him so she could hang on to her inheritance. 

Leaving court this afternoon, she appeared to have recovered from her tears, casting a smile at the crowds as she battled through photographers.

Emotional: Bindi had been seen to wipe away tears in Southwark Crown Court after her father was jailed for a string of sexual assaults, including abuses of her best friend on holiday when she was 13

The trial laid bare the strained 
relationship between the star and his only child after rows over his 
child abuse, infidelity and whether she would inherit his £11million 
fortune.

Southwark Crown Court in London heard how Bindi Nicholls considered suicide when the star admitted he had an affair with her best friend.

She then smashed her father's art, 'banged her head against the wall' when she was told her 'b******' father abused the same girl from the age of 13.

The prosecution also accused Mrs Nicholls of 'colluding' with her father because she was 'financially' dependent on him, producing an email where she described her possible inheritance as like 'winning the lottery'.

Dispute: Mrs Nicholls, 50, was accused of supporting her father in a push for inheritance. She said the letter referred to was taken out of context and continued to stand by him until he was taken to his cell (pictured)

Escorting: She accompanied him in a boat down the River Thames from his house in Bray, Berkshire, to court

Support: Harris was flanked by his wife Alwen and daughter Bindi when the jury found him guilty of all counts

Family: The trial heard Harris cheated on his wife Alwen (left) and had explosive rows with his daughter Bindi

But she said the message, which was released by the judge after being shown to jurors, was being taken out of context - and denied 'helping' her 84-year-old father for any other reason than to tell the truth. 

Mrs Nicholls routinely escorted her father in and out of court hand-in-hand.

Today she took him in a boat from his house in Bray, Berkshire, up the River Thames to hear his sentence, while her mother Alwen stayed at home.
