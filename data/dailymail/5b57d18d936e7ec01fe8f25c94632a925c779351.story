Cheryl Cole unveiled stills from her new music video, Crazy Stupid Love, and they may have featured some serious style credentials, killer dance moves and a cameo appearance from Tinie Tempah but we were far more preoccupied with something else.

The 30-year-old Geordie, who is gearing up to make her hugely anticipated comeback after a two-year hiatus from the music world, showcased an enviable set of abs in the behind the scenes of the video.

Wearing a daring croptop, the singer looks in her best shape yet - and now she's revealed the secret behind her washboard abs and honed physique.

What's your secret, Chezza? Cheryl Cole unveiled behind the scenes stills from her upcoming comeback single, Crazy Stupid Love and showed off her enviable abs

In an interview with Glamour's Alessandra Steinherr, Cheryl said: 'I do the Tracy Anderson method. I've been doing it for a long time now. It's not easy but if you push yourself through, I love it.'

Tracy Anderson, a former dancer and business partner of Gwyneth Paltrow, has produced four exercise DVDs - each of which has sold in excess of 20,000 copies in Britain alone - and a book, Tracy Anderson's 30-Day Method.

Cheryl's in good company because as well as training Gwyneth, Tracy works with Madonna, Shakira, Nicole Ritchie and J-Lo.

Luckily for Cheryl, she actually enjoys Tracy's work-outs. 'I'm at the point where I enjoy it,' she said.

'A lot of people hate going to the gym or can't think of anything worse but I get up in the morning and I like it - and I eat healthy.'

The former Girls Aloud star also recently revealed 
that she is 'obsessed' with burrata mozzarella, a creamy calorific 
cheese, which has replaced sushi as her new favourite food.

Speaking
 to Hello! magazine about her slimmer figure, she said: 'I have been 
diagnosed as being intolerant to soya, so maybe that has made a 
difference.

'Sadly it means no more sushi - that used to be my favourite food. Now it's burrata mozzarella...I'm a bit obsessed.'

In stills for her new music video, the X Factor judge can 
be seen surrounded by dancers on the video shoot, which took place in 
Hackney last week over a course of 20 hours.

Speaking
 last week about the video, she revealed: 'The video isn't what I've 
done before and in terms of lighting and stuff, it's a bit more grimy! 
'Cos the songs quite up, and pop, it's got that feel, so I wanted it to 
have the urban twist. It's a bit more of that urban vibe.'

Cheryl's
 return marks the end of a two-year hiatus from the charts, with her new
 single due for release via Polydor Records on July 20 - shortly before 
she makes her television comeback on the panel of The X Factor.

Crazy
 Stupid Love, described as 'a blast of feel-good pop', sees Cheryl 
collaborate with rapper Tinie Tempah, as well as songwriter Wayne 
Wilkins, who wrote her million-selling debut Fight For This Love.

Cheryl
 said: 'I can’t remember being so excited to be releasing new music. 
After taking some time out I feel brand new and I had such a special 
time making this record.'  

That's not fair! Svelte Cheryl Cole has revealed that she is 'obsessed' with burrata mozzarella and even commits carbicide

Crazy 
Stupid Love is the first single taken from Cheryl’s forthcoming 
as-yet-untitled album, which will be released this autumn and sees 
her collaborate with writers and producers ranging from Sia and Greg 
Kurstin to former Girls Aloud bandmate Nicola Roberts.

Speaking
 about her return she said: 'I'm not nervous. I'm excited. I've been 
around for 12 years, I've had a long run of it. And so now this is just 
what I love, it's my passion.

'It's
 what I've always done. So it's more of an excitement to be back. I've 
had enough time away to breathe, and really appreciate what I do.

The video will premiere on Monday and the single is release on July 20th.
