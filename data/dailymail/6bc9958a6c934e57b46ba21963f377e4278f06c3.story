The active search for a 19-year-old student who has been missing for nearly three weeks after his crashed SUV was found abandoned on a California road, has been called off.

Bryce Laspisa's family last heard from the teenager in the early hours of August 30, when he called his mother saying he was too tired to drive.

His car was found on its side, with the rear window smashed but the teenager's cell phone and wallet were still inside. But there has been no trace of Bryce.

Missing: Bryce Laspisa has been missing since August 30

Family members and Bryce's girlfriend, Kim Sly, have been helping search efforts, rallying volunteers to spread flyers and help them hike remote trails in the hope that the red-haired teenager will be found.

Police have also taken part in an extensive search, checking the surrounding area and lake, as well as searching from the air.

However, three weeks on Californian authorities have announced that their active search has been called off.

'It’s a tragedy he has not been found and the unknowns that go along with that. Frankly, it breaks our hearts too,' Los Angeles County sheriff's Captain, Mike Parker, said.

Police will now rely on routine patrols and following up any new leads, according to the Los Angeles Times.  

Bryce's uncle, who has helped arrange
the family's search, made an emotional plea to his nephew to get in 
touch last week.

'Make a call, have somebody make contact. Whatever it is, we'll work through it,' Glenn David said on ABC 7.

Hope: Bryce with his parents, Karen and Michael Laspisa

Distinctive: The 19-year-old has a large tattoo on his left shoulder which could help identify him

Appeal: The teenager's family have pleaded with him to get in touch

In the initial search a burned body believed to be Bryce was found in the lake, but tests showed it actually belonged to a 35-year-old man named Lamondre Deon Miles.

Three people have since been arrested over the death of Mr Miles, who was found burned and with bullet wounds.

Bryce had been heading back to his Laguna Niguel home from the Sacramento area when he went missing, KTLA5 reported.

It was thought that he had been involved in a crash that perhaps left him disorientated, confused or embarrassed, and that he then wandered off into the wilderness.

According to an update earlier this week, posted by his parents on a Facebook page set up to find the teenager, evidence suggests Bryce left the recreation area near to where his car was found down an embankment.

'No matter what the circumstances of Bryce’s disappearance, the detectives are still working the case and will continue to follow up on any leads they receive,' the family said in the post.

The Facebook page is filled with people volunteering to join the search for Bryce, or distribute flyers in the hope the 5ft 11in teenager, who has a large, distinctive tattoo on his left arm, will be spotted.

Missed: Bryce with girlfriend Kim Sly who is helping search for him

Even a psychic left a comment on the page, with directions for where she believed he could be found.

With no clear idea of where the teenager could be, search efforts have included trails around the lake area, homeless shelters and hospitals.

Local stores and coffee shops have also tried to help, by allowing volunteers to meet and use their facilities as they coordinate their search.
