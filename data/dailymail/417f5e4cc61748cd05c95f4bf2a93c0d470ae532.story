Officials have revealed a handyman who is charged with the murders of a pregnant celebrity chef and her husband had human remains in a wood stove at his home. 

Robert Jason Owens, 37, is suspected of killing Cristie Schoen Codd, 38, a season eight finalist on the Food Network Star, and her husband, 45-year-old Joseph Codd.

The couple were reported missing from their Leicester, North Carolina home on Sunday.

Owens has also been named as the main person-of-interest in a cold case killing.

The bodies of pregnant celebrity chef Cristie Schoen Codd (left), 38, a season 8 finalist on Food Network Star, and her husband Joseph Codd (right), 45, were found dead at their home this week

Police said on Friday that Owens admitted he had stored and destroyed the bodies of the couple at his home, The Citizen-Times reported. 

Investigators also said they found human remains inside a wood stove in Owens' home. 

Owens admitted that he had hit the husband, who worked as a grip on Hollywood movies, with his truck. There were no details on how Mrs Codd was killed. 

Police said earlier this week that Owens was also being looked at in the disappearance of 18-year-old college student Zebb Quinn in 2000. 

The student vanished 15 years ago after going to look at a car for sale in Asheville with Owens, then 21.

Quinn, who has not been seen since January 2, 2000, was captured on surveillance video buying sodas with Owens at a convenience store after he got off work at Walmart at 9pm. 

The pair then drove away separately. But they were apparently heading to the same destination to look at a Mitsubishi Eclipse for sale that Quinn was interested in buying, police told Fox Carolina. 

Asheville Police Sgt. Dave Romick told ABC: 'Owens was a friend of Zebb Quinn. He was a person of interest almost immediately. Over the course of 15 years, he has become the primary person of interest.'

Owens was never charged in the disappearance. 

Police found the remains of the Codds  in Buncombe County after the couple were reported missing on Sunday.

Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan said at a news conference Friday that deputies think the Codds were dead for three days before officers were called to their home.

Search warrants say Owens threw away a trash bag with one victim's belongings on Sunday. 

Duncan wouldn't talk about a motive for the killing. 

Warrants show deputies took 11 knives and a saw blade from Owens' home.

Owens, who the couple had hired to work on their home, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder, the murder of an unborn child, larceny and breaking and entering on Tuesday. 

Following Zebb Quinn's disappearance, Owens told police that while they were on their way to see the car, his friend pulled over and said he had to go, after being left in a 'frantic state' from a message he had received.

The 18-year-old student hasn't been seen since.   

On January 3, 2000, Quinn's mother, Denise Vlahakis, filed a missing person's report. 

Two weeks later, the Quinn's car, a 1990 Mazda Protégé, was found in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant.

Bizarrely, a live puppy was inside the vehicle, which was parked at The Little Pigs Barbecue near a hospital where Ms Vlahakis worked. A pair of lips were also drawn on the car's back windshield. 

The puppy was later adopted by a police officer.  

Ms Vlahakis later said of her son: 'We all feel very certain that he was killed that night', explaining how he had no extra clothes, money or contact lenses solution with him on the night he vanished.

She added: 'It is hard because we don't know and it's hard because we can't say goodbye and kind of put everything at rest.'
