Following his apology over his rough treatment of the Cologne club mascot - a goat - forward Anthony Ujah showed there were no hard feelings as he celebrated Hennes VIII's birthday.

The Nigeria international rushed over to the sideline after scoring during a 4-1 win against Frankfurt on Sunday  before pulling forcefully on the unsuspecting Hennes' horns in celebration.

And after admitting his regret over the incident the 28-year-old striker spent the day at the local zoo as mascot Hennes celebrated his eighth birthday.

Ujah was pictured holding the goat on a lead and was even snapped holding a bunch of carrots while feeding the mascot.

On Monday Ujah took to social media to apologise for his overzealous handling of Hennes.  

'Perfect Sunday. Sorry Hennes. I was a bit too rough on him,' Ujah wrote on Twitter and Facebook while also posting a photo of him pulling the goat.
