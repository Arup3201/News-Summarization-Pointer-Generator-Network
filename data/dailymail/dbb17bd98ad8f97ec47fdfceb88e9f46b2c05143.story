A headmistress wrote to a mother telling her to postpone her daughter’s birthday party because it is on the night before her younger sister’s exams.

Tina Adams was outraged when she received a letter from Cathy Noble suggesting the party for her older daughter Roisin, who is no longer a pupil at the school, might prevent 11-year-old Niamh from preparing for her Year 6 SATs.

To add insult to injury, the letter was riddled with errors.

Miss Adams, with daughters Roisin and Niamh, was asked to consider postponing the birthday party

Miss Adams, 50, claims teachers at 
The Castle Primary School in Tiverton, Devon, found out about Roisin’s 
Grease-themed 13th birthday party and quizzed Niamh about who was going 
and how long it would last. Some of Niamh’s classmates had also been 
invited.

Miss Adams then received a letter 
from Mrs Noble, suggesting that the timing of the two-hour party, due to
end at 9.30pm on Sunday, was inappropriate.

Miss Adams, of Tiverton, said: ‘They 
are blowing the whole thing out of proportion. I am a responsible parent
and said to other parents that if they didn’t want their children to 
come, or if they wanted to pick them up early, then I wouldn’t be 
offended.

‘But I feel very strongly that this is a parental matter and not something the school should get involved in.

‘The kids have worked extremely hard 
for these tests and there’s nothing wrong with a bit of rest and fun to 
let their hair down. It might even improve their performance.

‘Now Niamh is upset about it and 
thinks we’ve done something wrong. When she was taken out of lunch and 
asked who was going she didn’t know what to say, she told me she was so 
embarrassed.’

Cathy Noble of The Castle Primary School in Tiverton suggested to Miss Adams that her timing could be better

The council housing officer added: 
‘The teachers are worried about SAT results, which are more about the 
school’s reputation than anything else.’

Miss Adams also pointed out 
grammatical errors made in the letter, including misplaced apostrophes 
and a lower case letter at the start of a sentence.

It also makes reference to Niamh’s ‘brother’ even though she has two sisters, Roisin and Katie, who is 16.

Miss Adams said that the party had 
been all but ruined by the school. She said: ‘There was going to be 
about ten girls going in all and now it looks like there will be just 
five. Some of the mums have stopped their daughters going.

School head Mrs Noble wanted to ensure all pupils at her school, right, were rested and ready to sit their SATs

‘Roisin has said she’d rather not have the party now but it’s still going ahead.’

Mrs Noble said she was concerned about the party and had merely suggested another date might be more suitable.

‘SATs are the culmination of our 
pupils’ primary education and I wanted to make absolutely sure that the 
family were aware these important exams begin the next day. They can 
then make their own choices based on all the information,’ she said.
