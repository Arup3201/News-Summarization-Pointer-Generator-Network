The Federal Communications Commission has voted to approve rules that make internet services in the US should be in the same regulatory camp as telephones.

This means, providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T, will have to act in the 'public interest' when providing your internet connection.

The goal is to prevent those providers from creating paid internet 'fast lanes' and charging some sites to move their data faster than others. But how exactly will this impact your service?

What is net neutrality?

Whether you're trying to buy a necklace on Etsy or stream the season premiere of Netflix's 'House of Cards,' your internet service provider would have to load all of those websites equally quickly.

Broadband and fiber-optic service providers wouldn't potentially be able to create a tiered system where companies had to pay 'tolls' to get content to customers faster. 

What is the FCC voting on?

The Federal Communications Commission voted on whether to reclassify broadband access as a 'telecommunications service under Title II.'

In simple terms, the FCC has reclassified broadband as a utility, giving it more regulatory power over internet providers.

This means sites that create the content you read and watch online, won't face discrimination by network owners.  For instance, Verizon can't block Google Wallet on your smartphone, like it did in 2011.

Will changing how internet service providers are regulated also change your internet bill?

It's likely too early to say. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler reasons internet service providers should still retain their pricing flexibility because he isn't suggesting implementing the part of proposal that would let the FCC set rates. 

What's the difference between an ISP and a content provider?

An internet service provider is a company that provides you with access to the internet. Major players include AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, Cox and Time Warner Cable. 

Netflix and Amazon, meanwhile, are content providers. An ISP can also a content provider, such as Comcast which owns NBCUniversal.

If the proposal goes ahead, a video service couldn't be blocked or slowed down, for instance, because it competes with an offering from the carrier.  For instance, Verizon can't block Google Wallet on your smartphone, like it did in 2011

What does this mean for smartphones?

Even wireless carriers will fall under Title II if Wheeler's proposal.

That's important given that mobile phones are becoming the primary way that many people watch online video, play games, read and shop. 

The FCC estimates that about 55 per cent of all internet traffic now travels over mobile broadband networks.

A video service couldn't be blocked or slowed down, for instance, because it competes with an offering from the carrier. 

The proposal also extends to apps. Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile are developing a mobile payment system called Softcard, for instance, and blocking access to rival payment apps such as Apple Pay would be barred.

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has three primary goals: to prevent internet service providers from blocking traffic to any website obeying U.S. laws; to ban 'throttling,' the practice of slowing down service for a commercial purpose; and to prevent the creation of 'fast lanes'

Republican commissioner Ajit Pai warned 'that consumers that use less data may end up subsidizing consumers that use more data'

A Republican Federal Communications Commission board member last month issued a doomsday warning on his government agency's plan to adopt so-called net neutrality rules. 

Republican commissioner Ajit Pai pushed back on the decision by holding a press conference to disparage the FCC's 332 page 'secret plan' to take control of the internet that he cautioned would bring about 'adverse consequences to the entire Internet economy.'

Pai  warned 'that consumers that use less data may end up subsidizing consumers that use more data' and have 'less choice and less free data' if the plan is put into effect.

'My bottom line, if you like your current service plan, you should be able to keep your current service plan,' he said. 'The FCC shouldn't take it away from you.'

Referring to the proposal as 'President Obama's plan,' Pai said it 'gives the FCC broad and unprecedented discretion to micromanage the Internet.'

'This plan gives a Washington bureaucracy a blank check to decide how Internet service providers deploy and manage their networks from the last mile all the way through to the Internet backbone.'

Like other Republicans who oppose net neutrality rules, Pai said they would 'open the door to billions of dollars in new taxes on broadband' that could climb as high as $11 billion.

Are Verizon, AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner Cable and others really planning to charge individual companies for faster service?

The major internet service providers insist they have no plans to create such 'fast lanes' and therefore there is no need for changing the way they are regulated. 

They maintain that blocking or slowing down content wouldn't be in their best interests. 

But they do think that some companies that use a lot of data, like Netflix, might need to bear some of the cost of handling the heavy traffic they generate.

Wasn't all this debated years ago?

The FCC has so far enforced 'open Internet' rules with the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which was intended to encourage competition in the telephone and cable industry. 

However, a federal appeals court knocked down that approach.

President Barack Obama and consumer advocates say a better tack would be to apply Title II of the 1934 Communications Act. 

Written 80 years ago with radio, telegraph and phone service in mind, that law prohibits companies from charging unreasonable rates or threatening access to services that are critical to society. 

Customers of Netflix, which has produced shows including House of Cards (pictured), could be charged more to stream programmes if the website chooses to pay more for a better service

So what's not to like about net neutrality?

Internet service providers say they back the concept. But they don't want to face more, costly regulation and claim it would hurt the economy.

Their argument is the internet has been progressing just fine the way it is currently set up, thanks in parts to their expensive investments in network upgrades that have improved the quality of high-speed service and expanded its availability. 

More regulation will cost them more money - money they would otherwise spend on expanding and improving their networks, they say. 

That would have the trickle-down effect of hurting business creation and jobs.

What will happens now?

It will be a long time before anything materialises. Netflix won't stream any faster for you and ISPs won't stop investing in their networks or high speed fiber cables as a result. 

After commissioners make statements, the rules may not be published for a number of weeks. The rules will then go under regulatory review for months. The vote won't be official until, it is estimated, summertime. And even then, major telecom companies will challenge new rules in court.

Both those for and against net neutrality see a long road ahead.

Net neutrality is the principle that internet providers should give consumers access to all content and applications on an equal basis 

@highlight

Goal is to prevent providers from creating paid internet 'fast lanes'

@highlight

It means Netflix, for instance, can't be slowed if it competes with ISP

@highlight

Some say that by doing this the government will drive up internet bills

Other argue that it will ensure the free flow of content on the internet
