She is considered British acting royalty, still in hot demand with a raft of film and television awards under her belt, but Julie Walters is determined to age gracefully despite the pressures of the industry.

Looking ravishing on the cover of the Good Housekeeping January issue the 64-year-old reveals her horror at the American culture of plastic surgery. 

In an exclusive interview she says: 'I can't imagine living there! It's the facelifts and the whole attitude to women. Everyone who lives there says you have to have a facelift. And everyone has had them… Everyone. As people get older, they do this half-facelift stuff so they can pretend they haven't had them! I think: don't do it – be beautiful anyway.

64-old-actress Julie Walters has revealed that she hates the prominence of facelifts in American and says women shouldn't be pressured to have them and 'be beautiful anyway'

'If everybody had facelifts, there would be no one to play the old people! You see some American programmes and think: "Oh my god is that supposed to be her mother? I thought she was meant to be her sister? Oh please! Have some real faces!"

'The only thing I don't like about ageing is possibly becoming infirm. I don't mind the face looking older. That's just the way it is.'

Julie, who has been married to husband Grant Roffey for 14 years, also tells Good Housekeeping about keeping romance alive with love notes.

Julie reveals that husband Grant still buys her flowers every week and still leave love notes for each other 

The British treasure says that what makes her happy will always be knowing her family is okay 'knowing I've done a good days work'

'We can be romantic… Not soppy, though! We always leave notes for one another if I get in late or he has to get up early. And he brings me flowers every week. Sometimes I will leave a little note on his pillow if I'm going away. But even when I'm home we leave each other notes. 

'Love is the most important thing to me in my life. It really is what makes the world go round,' she says.  

The couple, who have a daughter Maisie together, moved to a farm in Sussex several years ago, which Grant runs.

'I had always fantasised about living in the country. Once I became an actor, I wanted to be with someone who had nothing to do with the business.

'It's a big escape. London is fabulous and I wouldn't want to be too far away from it. But it means work to me. To be in the middle of the woods is just lovely. 

'It has its tough side as it is hard work – for Grant! We've got cattle, sheep, pigs and chickens.'

But despite her love of rural life and escapism, Julie, who stars in the hotly anticipated new Paddington movie, has no plans to retire and time soon.   

'I never want to stop, unless I'm not well enough. I would love to go back to the National Theatre at some point. I only like to do things that interest me. 

'I turn down quite a few things, but I've never regretted that. I always think it's great for the actor who did it and they're much better than I would have been.'

Ultimately the British treasure says that what makes her happy will always be knowing her family is okay 'knowing I've done a good days work.'  

'I'm one of those people who has to feel like I've achieved something in the day. I hate those days where you feel you've done nothing. Those days where I think: should I do this?, I haven't done anything… Oh b@gger. I hate that.'
