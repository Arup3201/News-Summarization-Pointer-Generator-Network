Victim: Jane Bartholomew, 39, (pictured) was killed by her former boyfriend Scott Ellis, who was 'obsessed' with films and serial killers, a court heard

A man 'obsessed' with films and serial killers battered his former girlfriend to death with a claw hammer on Friday 13th, a court heard today.

Scott Ellis, 42, is accused of attacking Jane Bartholomew, 39, after using a spare key to get into her home in Martlesham Heath, near Ipswich, Suffolk.

He waited for his former partner to return home from taking two of their daughters to school, before killing her and slashing his own wrists, Ipswich Crown Court heard.

The court was told thatunemployed Ellis, a heavy cannabis smoker who had suffered from depression for years, could not accept that his 25 year relationship with Miss Bartholomew was over.

He allegedly assembled a 'killing kit' in the days before attacking her on Friday, June 13 this year, buying a hammer from a hardware store, and adding nylon rope, scissors, a modelling knife, bin liners, freezer bags, duct tape and a spade.

Ellis, who had suffered minor injuries, was taken to hospital and arrested after Miss Bartholomew's body was found.

A post mortem examination on the mother-of-three who worked in an electronics factory found she had suffered 22 blows to her head and had been strangled.

Ellis of Tunstall near Woodbridge denies murder, but has admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Tiler Mark Mayhew, who had been friends with Ellis since school, said in a statement read to the court: 'Scott is obsessed with films.'

He added: 'He was interested in notorious serial killers and knew a lot about them. He saw programmes about them and read books which made him knowledgeable about them.'

The court heard how Ellis, who lived in a converted garage at his mother's home, was the father of Bartholomew's three daughters.

The couple were said to have lived apart for around ten years, but continued in an 'on and off' relationship.

Mr Mayhew said Miss Bartholomew had been urging Ellis to get a job so they could be together 'like a normal family'.

However, he said that his friend later hacked into her email and discovered that she had put her profile on an internet dating website.

He added that Ellis had told him how he grabbed Miss Bartholomew by the throat and pushed her into a thorn bush at her workplace on May 22, leaving her with red marks on her neck.

Miss Bartholomew later told him in an internet conversation that her relationship with Ellis was over.

Mr Mayhew added: 'On Friday the 13th of June, I got a call from Scott at 2pm. Scott was in tears in a really bad way. He was crying and said. 'Mate you have got to come right now'.'

He said he drove to see Ellis at his home, but was turned away by his mother.

Peter Gair, prosecuting, said police officers used a crowbar to break into Miss Bartholomew's semi-detached home and found her body after the alarm was raised by the couple's 15-year-old daughter, who found the house locked.

Her  body was on the living room floor with her arms and legs bound with rope, a bag over her head and her feet covered by a bin liner.

She had damage to her fingernails consistent with her 'clawing' at her attacker as well as broken bones and bruising on her arms and hands consistent with her raising her arms to defend herself, added Mr Gair.

Ellis told police that he had been lying in wait for Miss Bartholomew and attacked her with the hammer when she returned home.

He also told officers that he had wanted her to die because she had 'hurt' him and he had intended to slit his wrists and die beside her.

Mr Gair added: 'He said he felt he couldn't live without her and didn't want her to meet anyone else.

'This killing was premeditated and planned and we say in all probability motivated by anger and rejection. We say the killing was brutally executed.'

Mr Gair said that Ellis had attacked his former partner from behind, striking her repeatedly over the head with the hammer and putting his hand over her mouth to stop her screaming.

Trial: Ipswich Crown Court (pictured) was told that Ellis had tried to clear up after Miss Bartholomew's death

After allegedly tying her legs and arms  and putting bags over her head and feet he tried to clean up some of the blood before leaving the house and locking the door behind him, the court heard. 

Jason Ball, another friend of Ellis, told the court that Ellis had told him he would be better off if she had died.

He said he also got a call from Ellis 'at 2pm on Friday the 13th of June'.

Mr Ball added: 'He was very distressed and not making too much sense. He said. 'I have done Jane' or 'I have done something terrible'.'

Mr Ball's brother Steven Ball who also spoke to Ellis before the killing said: 'Jane was putting pressure on him to get a job and be more responsible for the children.

'He said to me in April or May, 'I feel like taking a hammer to her, cutting her up, putting her in bags and getting rid of her in the sea.' I thought it was over the top, but I didn't think he was serious at the time.'

The trial continues.
