A second top-ranking official has left the IRS as the Obama Administration tries to dig out of the firestorm resulting from revelations that tax-collectors targeted conservative Tea Party groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status.

An internal IRS memo says Joseph Grant, commissioner of the agency's tax exempt and government entities division, will retire on June 3.

On Wednesday President Barack Obama demanded that acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller resign, making him the highest-ranking political casualty thus far in a series of scandals that have swept the administration in recent weeks.

In with the new: Daniel Werfel, the controller of the White House Office of Management and Budget, will become the new acting head of the IRS. He is a trusted Obama adviser

Obama has named longtime civil servant Daniel Werfel as the acting IRS commissioner. Werfel, 42, currently serves as controller of the Office of Management and Budget, making him a key player in implementing recent automatic spending cuts known as the sequester.

In a hastily called press conference in the East Room of the White House on Wednesday, Obama told reporters that he had asked Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew to find out who was responsible for a program that targeted tea party groups and other conservative organizations for a special level of intrusive questioning after they applied for tax-exempt charitable statuses.

'Lew took the first step by requesting and accepting the resignation of the acting director of the IRS,' Obama said.

'It’s important,' he added, 'to institute new leadership that can help restore confidence going forward.'

But in an email to IRS employees, Miller claimed he would only be leaving next month because his assignment would be over.

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, formerly Obama's chief of staff, gave Miller his walking papers, according to the president

'It is with regret that I will be 
departing from the IRS as my acting assignment ends in early June,' 
Miller wrote. 'This has been an incredibly difficult time for the IRS 
given the events of the past few days, and there is a strong and 
immediate need to restore public trust in the nation’s tax agency.'

The IRS, the president conceded, 'improperly screened conservative groups.' He referred to a report released Tuesday by the IRS's Inspector General.

'The misconduct that it uncovered is inexcusable,' Obama exclaimed. 'It's inexcusable and Americans are right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it.'

'It should not matter what political stripe you're from,' Obama said. 'The IRS has to operate with absolute integrity.'

President Barack Obama said he would implement the recommendations of the IG report, but insisted that acting IRS Commissioner Steven MIller would be stepping down. It's the highest-profile resignation in his five-year-old administration

Promising to adopt the recommendations of the Inspector General's report, Obama pledged to 'put in place new safeguards to make sure this kind of behavior can't ever happen again.'

'We will work with Congress as it performs its oversight role,' he added, saying the White House would march 'hand in hand with Congress to get this thing fixed.'

Tax laws, he insisted, must be 'enforced in a fair and impartial way.'

Miller's farewell letter cited 'a strong and immediate need to restore public trust in the nation’s tax agency.'

'I believe the Service will benefit from having a new Acting Commissioner in place during this challenging period,' he wrote. 'As I wrap up my time at the IRS, I will be focused on an orderly transition.'
