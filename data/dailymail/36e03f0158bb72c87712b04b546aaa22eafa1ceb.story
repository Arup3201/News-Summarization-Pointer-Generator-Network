Arsene Wenger threw in the towel on the title race on Sunday evening after watching Arsenal blow another winning position at Swansea.

The Gunners surrendered a lead at the Liberty Stadium, with Garry Monk's side scoring twice in three minutes through Gylfi Sigurdsson and Bafetimbi Gomis to turn the game on its head. 

Alexis Sanchez had put the visitors in front, but they weren't able to hold on for the second time in a week.

‘Chelsea are on an average of 100 points this season,’ the Arsenal boss explained. ‘If you look at the number of points they have, if they keep that up nobody will catch them.

‘There doesn’t look to be anybody capable of challenging them at the moment.’ 

Wenger was far less impressed with his own side, who led through Sanchez before a wonderful Sigurdsson free-kick and Gomis’s header left the Gunners 12 points off the pace.

The turnaround followed their stunning Champions League capitulation from 3-0 up against Anderlecht in midweek, in which they stuttered to a 3-3 draw.

Wenger said: ‘Chelsea are on an average of 100 points this season. If you look at the number of points they have, if they keep that up nobody will catch them, that’s for sure.

‘There doesn’t look to be anybody capable of challenging them at the moment.’

He added: ‘We had a very disappointing week, considering the performances we produced and the end results we got are very disappointing. 

‘We were 3-0 up against Anderlecht and 1-0 up here and in the end we lose two points against Anderlecht and three points against Swansea. I think it’s very, very disappointing because you have to be capable, once you are 1-0 up and a big team, to win the game.’

Wenger was at a loss to explain the latest collapse, in which Mathieu Flamini looked furious after being substituted for Jack Wilshere in the second half and then stormed down the tunnel at full time.

Wenger admitted Flamini’s behaviour ‘is not my biggest worry at the moment’ as he rued a missed chance to climb back into the top four.

‘I don’t know how damaging it is (to morale), but in the table certainly it’s very disappointing,’ he said. ‘We had an opportunity to come back into the top four in a bit more of a comfortable way. That we didn’t take it is disappointing.’ 

He added: ‘It’s unfortunate to lose a game like that. We produced quite a decent performance for 75 minutes but you have to last 90 minutes. Did Tuesday night play a part in our mind? I don’t think so. I hope not.

‘You have to give Swansea credit - they didn’t give up, they fought until the end, they scored a good free-kick and in the end we lost the three points. That’s very sad.’

Monk, who has guided Swansea to fifth in his first campaign as permanent manager, said: ‘We saw what happened in midweek (to Arsenal) but we prepared for the Arsenal we all know. I know they suffered in midweek but they are dangerous. We managed them very well.

‘We are very happy going into the international break with the points that we have.’
