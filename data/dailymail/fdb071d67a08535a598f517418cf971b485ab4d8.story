Taking a stand: Rupert Murdoch tweeted about article which claims carbon dioxide is actually making the planet greener

Rupert Murdoch has taken to Twitter to attack environmentalists claiming that rising levels of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels have been good for the planet.

The media mogul based his statements on an article which reported that 30 years of satellite images have shown that the Earth is actually getting greener.

Murdoch, a frequent and outspoken critic of renewable energy, tweeted today: 'World growing greener with increased carbon.

'Thirty years of satellite evidence. Forests growing faster and thicker.'

He then referenced an article by Matt Ridley in the Wall Street Journal on January 5.

Earlier in the day, the tycoon had posted: 'Why not switch from useless renewable energy investments to real job creating infrastructure projects. Many great possibilities waiting.'

The WSJ article contends that over 30 years, the world has become a greener place going against the arguments of environmentalists that our planet is at risk from deforestation harming our fragile ecosystem.

Ridley writes: 'The inescapable if unfashionable 
conclusion is that the human use of fossil fuels has been causing the 
greening of the planet...'

The conclusion is drawn from data collected since the Eighties by NASA scientist Compton Tucker who tracked global vegetation using satellite sensors. 

The researcher discovered that forests were getting larger across the world - from the spruces of Canada to the Amazon rainforests.

Outspoken: The Wall Street Journal owner has based his opinion on a piece written by a journalist in his own newspaper

The reason is given that if people burn fossil fuels then there is more carbon dioxide for plants to consume which in turn, makes them grow faster.  

The Wall Street Journal owner has been vocal on issues from gun control to the Israel-Palestine conflict via his official account.

He waded into the debate on U.S. gun control at the end of last year following a spate of shootings including the massacre at Sandy Hook school in Connecticut and two firefighters being killed by a gunman in New York. 

On Christmas Day he wrote: 'NY Xmas ruined by lunatic shooting 4 firemen, killing two. Shooter killed before, jailed, later released on medical grounds. Must wake up,' he wrote just after noon in the East Coast.'

His tweet referenced the Christmas Eve shooting when gunman William Spengler set up a trap for emergency responders, killing two, after the arrived at his burning house in Webster, New York.
