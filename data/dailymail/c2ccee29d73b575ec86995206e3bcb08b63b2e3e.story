As far as celebrity feuds go, it seems Kelly Brook and Katie Price's is set to continue a while longer.

Glamour model Katie has now upped the spat by warning Kelly that her boyfriend Danny Cipriani will never be faithful to her.

Price, also known as Jordan, reignited her bitter war of words with the TV presenter, 33, on Twitter on Tuesday night, claiming the rugby star is always trying to contact her, days after Kelly mocked her recent marriage to Kieran Hayler on Celebrity Juice.

their war of words

The 35-year-old mother-of-three lashed out at Kelly, writing: '@IAMKELLYBROOK pick up the phone if you hav a prob instead of hiding behind a tv screen to bully me!

'@IAMKELLYBROOK ask danny about his emails & texes sent to me behind your back which ill show you kieran agrees he will never be faithful.'

Katie's comments come after Kelly made fun of her third marriage on Celebrity Juice on Thursday, when host Keith Lemon asked the panel: 'What did Katie Price do for her husband on their wedding day?'

Claws out: Kelly Brook has started to ignore Katie Price's tweets, but the glamour model has warned Danny Cipriani will 'never be faithful' to her

Kelly replied: 'Did she burn my calendar hanging on his wall?'

When a fan tweeted Katie about the joke, she replied: 'I'm sure kelly wouldn't be laughing if I said the things Danny Cip said to me about her in the bedroom when I was with him hahaha (sic).'

Kelly then hit back and implied that she was still in touch with Danny, when he briefly dated Katie in October 2011, despite living with then-boyfriend Thom Evans at the time.

She wrote: 'No but I did laugh when he turned up at my house driving your car the next day ;) I don't think you know anything.'

On Tuesday night, Katie thanked Kelly for confirming that Danny had driven her car 'without a license and insurance'.

She then teased fans that she would reveal all about her brief fling with the rugby player in her upcoming autobiography.

But Brook has been ignoring Katie's last comments, instead choosing to post pictures of her holiday with Danny instead.

The models have been embroiled in a bitter feud since Kelly reunited with Danny in February and Katie called her a 'heffer'.

She
added: 'Rumour has it she's been hanging out with our mutual ex Danny 
Cipriani. Knowing him, I guess she's probably been doing a bit of 
comfort eating.'

Kelly and Katie seemed to have reached a ceasefire recently after weeks of trading barbs.

However, the rift between the two models is back on and seems to have reached a new level after the latest bout of tweets started over the weekend.

The row was fired up again on Thursday night on Kelly's last episode of Celebrity Juice, when she mocked Katie's recent marriage to Kieran Hayler.

When someone tweeted Katie telling her she was being 'mugged off hard', she responded: 'I'm flattered she must be obsessed with me as has to keep mentioning me.'

When one Twitter user included Kelly 
and Katie's handles in her message, it ended up creating an online 
dialogue between the rivals.

On Friday night, Katie initially refrained from replying to Kelly's comment directly, she did retweet a comment from a follower suggesting Kelly should keep quiet.

The tweet, by @TysonPrice4 read: '@IAMKELLYBROOK Why don't you leave @MissKatiePrice name out of you're mouth u stupid b**ch !!!'

Katie briefly dated Danny in October 2011, (during a break from ex-fiance Leandro Penna) who has since reunited with Kelly in February this year.

Kelly and Danny originally dated from 2008 until 2010, before she went on to have a two year romance with his former Wasps teammate Thom Evans.

However, Kelly returned to her ex just weeks after splitting from Thom in January 2013.

The row between Katie and Kelly kicked off in February this year, when the former accused the brunette model of looking heavier after seeing photos of her shooting her New Look swimwear campaign in Miami.

She wrote her column in The Sun: 'The pictures of Kelly modelling her latest New Look swimwear range in Miami don't seem to be airbrushed and I'm FLABbergasted to see how big Kelly really is.

'You're a heffer (sic), Kelly, but still a hot one.'

She even suggested Kelly was 'comfort eating' because she was seeing her ex-boyfriend Danny again.

Soon after, Kelly responded, accusing the mother-of-three of being 'rude'.

She said: 'I actually wish her all the best. It's sad isn't it? I think it's a bit sad...

'I think girls can get away with having a bit of meat on our bones; I donâ€™t mind a wobbly arm or a bit of cellulite.'

However, a few days later, Kelly couldn't resist making a pop of Katie on Celebrity Juice, when she compared her to the character Magda from the hit movie There's Something About Mary.

When asked by host Keith Lemon what she would do if Katie was there, she replied: 'What, Magda from There's Something About Mary?'

Magda was the fiftysomething, sun-worshipping next door neighbour of Cameron Diaz's character Mary in the hit 1998 comedy.

Played by actress Lin Shaye, she was known for her bleached blonde hair, permatan and caked on make-up... not unlike Katie.

That fired up Katie even more, who 
posted a zoomed-in photo of Kelly's naked breasts, which had been taken 
on holiday in St Barts in 2008.

However, Kelly responded with another dig a few weeks later on the ITV2 show, when she played a game where an image of Katie's swimsuit-clad figure had been projected over her.

Unaware of Katie's body being projected across the green screen she had stuck her head through, Kelly eventually realised who she was supposed to be and asked: 'Do I talk a lot of s**t?'
