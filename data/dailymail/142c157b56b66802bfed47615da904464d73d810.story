A police investigation found the woman had been at a New Years Eve party at a house located on Garden Drive.

Outside the house she became engaged in a spirited rap contest with some men, according to The Ledger.

Two other men, one of whom was also armed, joined them in the car.

The woman was driven to a vacant lot located at 988 Farr Rd.

Police allege the trio then sexually assaulted her.

She was transported to Midtown Medical Center in a critical condition and has since had extensive medical treatment.

Johnson was arrested on Thursday, Garron on Friday and Glover on Saturday.

Columbus police Sgt. Lance Deaton told The Ledger-Enquirer that it had been a long investigation and it wasn't over.
