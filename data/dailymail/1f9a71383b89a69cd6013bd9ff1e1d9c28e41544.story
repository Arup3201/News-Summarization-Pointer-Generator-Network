Police today launched a huge manhunt for a serial arsonist who hit Hollywood for a second night early this morning.

Another eight fires were set in the area last night after 22 blazes were set in only four hours on Friday morning.

Dozens of Hollywood residents were forced out of their homes and power was disrupted in several neighbourhoods shortly after midnight.

‘It was a long, tough night,’ a Los Angeles County fire spokesman said, adding that the department does not yet have any suspect description.

'Thank goodness no one was seriously injured or killed,” Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said at an afternoon news conference, where he was joined by county and West Hollywood officials.

West Hollywood Mayor John Duran heatedly spoke directly to the person or persons suspected of starting the fires, reports the LA Times.

'What were you thinking?” he said. “This is the most dense part of Los Angeles. If you’re trying to say something, this is not the way to say it.”

Authorities ruled out any possible link to terrorism while bracing for 
another round of arson attacks, reports CBS News.

One of the blazes happened at the former home of late Doors lead singer Jim Morrison, who died in Paris in 1971 aged just 27.

He used to live in the house with girlfriend Pamela Courson in the 1960s and it provided the inspiration for the Doors song ‘Love Street’.

There were no civilian injuries on Friday but one city fireman was treated and released from a hospital after a fall while battling a blaze.

I woke up really scared,’ evacuated resident Daniel Meza told KABC.

‘I heard somebody saying, “Fire, fire”. The smoke was in my face.’

Mr Meza had to run and get his little sister as well as wake up his parents and tell them all to get out of his block of flats.

Arson investigators are looking for building CCTV and eyewitnesses.

‘If you see something, say something,’ the L.A. County fire spokesman said.

A $35,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the conviction of the arsonist or arsonists.

County supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky told Msnbc.com that the county is putting up $25,000 and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is adding another $10,000.

Yaroslavsky added there around $350,000  worth of damage was caused to property in West Hollywood alone from the fires.

Fire officials couldn't say whether the rash of fires was the work of a copycat as there was a series of other arson fires early Thursday, also in Hollywood.

Two people have been arrested and remain in custody for those blazes, officials said.

Samuel Arrington, 22, of Sunland, L.A., was arrested along with another person on Thursday when a shop worker allegedly saw him trying to cause damage.

‘We have so many that are going around hitting occupancies just like this, carports with residents above,’ an L.A. City fire spokesman told KABC.

Hollywood is served by the L.A. city police and fire departments. But the fire and sheriff's departments of L.A. County serve West Hollywood.
