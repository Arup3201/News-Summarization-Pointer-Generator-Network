Muammar Gadaffi bedded at least four women just hours before meeting Prince Andrew for trade talks, it was claimed today.

The Libyan dictator had a voracious sexual appetite and was so addicted to anti-impotence Viagra pills a nurse told him to cut down his intake.

The sordid world of the despot who was killed last month in the country's uprising, has been revealed by his manservant of seven years.

Voracious: Libyan leader Muammar Gadaffi lived a life of extravagance and sexual addiction

Faisal, a young chef, cooked Andrew a 'traditional' dinner of tabouli, hummus and couscous when the prince met the Arab leader at the villa of one of his female friends.

Later Andrew, who's office has confirmed he dined with Gadaffi in November 2008, told Faisal it was the finest meal he had ever had and posed for a picture with him.

The aide, now 29, said the royal trade ambassador discussed relations between Libya and Britain and an oil contract.

What Andrew was unaware of was Gaddafi's penchant for young women - many of whom were his bodyguards, according to Faisal.

He said: There were four or sometimes five women each day. They had just become a habit to Gadaffi.

'They would go into his bedroom, he would have his way with them and then he would come out like he had just blown his nose.'

Faisal, on leave from prison for the Muslim holiday of Eid, became friends with the bodyguards who were known as the 'Nuns of the Revolution'.

He told the Sunday Times: They all had sex with Gadaffi. The more canny of them became wealthy from his gifts of villas or large sums of cash.'

Faisal claimed that some of the women he bedded suffered so badly 'they went immediately from his bedroom to the hospital' to be treated for internal injuries.

His addiction to Viagra, said the aide, was so extensive that his Ukrainian nurse urged to him to reduce the number of pills he swallowed every day.

Gadaffi picked up victims at his former alma mater, Tripoli University, where he gave lectures and then led the young women to a nearby room whose only furniture was a double bed.

Faisal claimed that another aide was once sent to a sex district of Paris, to buy a machine that Gadaffi used to apparently lengthen his penis.

The despot was vain about his looks and demanded the aide dye his hair,Â  cover up his baldness and use make-up and treatments with green tea to hide his wrinkles.

Faisal, who became a favourite of the dictator with his own house and car, sprayed a French-made lotion on the front of Gadaffi's head so his receding hairline would not be obvious.

The aide was forced to be his servant after death threats were made against his family unless he obeyed. Faisal was captured by anti-Gadaffi forces but is unlike to be charged.
