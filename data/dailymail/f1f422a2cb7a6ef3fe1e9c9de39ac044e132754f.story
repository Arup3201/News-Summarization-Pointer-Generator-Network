A coroner has recommended that dangerous lakes are dyed black or ringed with stinging nettles to discourage swimmers, after hearing how two people drowned at a beauty spot on the same day.

Ryan Pettengell, 41, and Umar Balogun, 16, drowned in separate incidents at Bawsey Pits in Norfolk on July 16 last year after going swimming on a hot summer's day.

Swimming is banned in the waters because of dangerous, near-invisible weeds growing below the surface but warning signs are often ignored.

Tragic: Police officers stand guard at Bawsey Pits the day after Ryan Pettengell and Umar Balogun drowned last year. Norfolk coroner Jacqueline Lake said the water must be made less attractive to swimmers

At an inquest into Mr Pettengell's death, Norfolk coroner Jacqueline Lake said the water at Bawsey Pits should be dyed black to make it less attractive to swimmers.

She said other options could include 'aggressively' planting nettles and having warning signs in foreign languages so there could be no mistaking the danger.

The Norwich inquest heard how Mr Pettengell, from Kings Lynn, Norfolk, drowned as he tried to swim to an island to join his girlfriend Lauren Cole.

Ms Cole told the hearing how she watched Mr Pettengell get into difficulties, then swam out to help.

She said: 'I saw him swim about half way and then he began to slow down. He said in a breathless voice 'Get me a stick, get me a log'.'

She said: 'I ripped off a branch and swam out to him. I held the branch but it wouldn't float...I grabbed his arm and started to pull him. I was being pulled under and I had to swim back to the side.'

Location: Bawsey Pitt is a beauty spot close to the town of King's Lynn in northern Norfolk

'As I swam back I could see him going under. I looked back and I saw the bubbles where Ryan had been.'

Police and fire teams were called but the police officers at the scene were unable to help as they were not strong enough swimmers, the inquest heard.

Mr Pettengell's body was eventually recovered by fire crews around 7.30pm that night - two hours before Mr Balogun's was recovered from a nearby lake.

Emergency services were at Bawsey Pits searching for Mr Balogun when they were alerted to Mr Pettengell's disappearance.

A postmortem later confirmed that 16-year-old Mr Balogun, who was originally from Waltham Forest in London but had been living in Ely, Cambridgeshore, also died by drowning.

Signs: Swimmers continually ignore warning signs at Bawsey Pits. Coroner Jacqueline Lake suggested the waters are circled by stinging nettles to prevent swimmers accessing them

Speaking outside the inquest earlier in the week, Mr Pettengell's best friend Wesley Moule, who was also with him on the day he died, told the BBC: 'He was the sort of guy that if he knew someone was in trouble, he would have gone out of his way to help them out.'

He said Mr Pettengell was a good swimmer and had thought he was joking when he first appeared to be in trouble.

'As soon as he didn't come back up again we realised that he wasn't and that something was seriously wrong'.

Last summer a Blue Lagoon in Derbyshire was dyed black to deter swimmers from entering the toxic water.
