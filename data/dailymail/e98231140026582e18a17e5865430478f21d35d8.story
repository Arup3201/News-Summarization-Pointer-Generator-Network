For a man with so much going on in his head, Wilfried Bony has done a fair job of relocating his feet. It’s barely been three weeks since the Ivorian with 25 goals to his name last season was facing questions of his failure to score even one in this campaign.

Sigurdsson has had a hand in eight goals (seven assists, one goal) in nine PL games for Swansea this season.

Those have been sufficiently addressed, with four strikes in three games, including the two on Saturday that saw off Leicester and made his position in forthcoming contract talks a touch stronger.

Those discussions are expected to commence imminently, with Bony (right) happy to extend his commitment beyond the summer of 2017, though he has made no secret of his ambitions to join a bigger club.

The Ivorian scored 25 goals for Swansea last campaign and has answered his critics in the last three weeks

SWANSEA (4-2-3-1): Fabianski 6; Rangel 7, Fernandez 6, Williams 7, Taylor 6; Ki 6, Shelvey 6.5; Routledge 6 (Dyer 83min), Sigurdsson 7.5 (Carroll 58, 6), Montero 7; Bony 8 (Gomis 83). Subs not used: Tremmel, Emnes, Bartley, Shephard.

Scorer: Bony 34, 57.

LEICESTER (4-4-2): Schmeichel 5; De Laet 5, Morgan 7, Moore 6.5, Konchesky 6.5; Mahrez 6, Hammond 6 (King 68, 6), Drinkwater 6 (Cambiasso 68, 6), Vardy 6 (James 67, 6); Nugent 5, Ulloa 5. Subs not used: Smith, Schlupp, Wasilewski, Wood.

Referee: Mike Jones 7.

Man of the match: Wilfried Bony.

Approaches never came in the summer despite interest from Liverpool and Tottenham, but that will surely change if the 25-year-old matches last season’s goal tally, which is his target. ‘I knew the goals would come,’ said Bony, who celebrated his strikes against Leicester with a T-shirt tribute to two friends who died recently. ‘When I wasn’t scoring the team was doing well. Now, the team needs me to score and I did. I have a target in my head and I will take it step by step.’

Of his contract situation, Bony added: ‘Contract talks I leave to my agent. But I am happy.’

Garry Monk, meanwhile, does not expect to be charged by the FA after he said Stoke’s Victor Moses cheated. He said: ‘I’ve been in contact with the FA. I’ve made my views, I’m happy with them and I can’t see anything happening after that.’

Leicester boss Nigel Pearson has seen his side go four games without a win since the 5-3 victory over Manchester United. He said: ‘The problem is people want to talk about that (the United game) all the time. But as soon as that game is over it is not important.’
