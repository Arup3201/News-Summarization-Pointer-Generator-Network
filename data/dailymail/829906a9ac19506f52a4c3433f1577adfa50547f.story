With her bold wardrobe choices, singer Rihanna is almost as famous for what she wears as for her music so nobody was surprised when she announced a collaboration with River Island back in July.

But now the singer has gone one better and has revealed that not only did she design the 50 piece collection herself, she also intends to present it to the world on the London Fashion Week catwalk.

The invitation-only show will take place on the 16th February and will be styled by the pop princess in person and followed by a huge after show party in the capital.

Behind the scenes: Rihanna has dropped a few hints about the contents of the collection via Instagram

'Launching at London Fashion Week is a dream come true for me,' the Barbadian singer revealed.

'I have wanted to design my own collection for a long time and to present my collection for River Island alongside all of the other great design talent at LFW is a real privilege.

'I can't wait to see the reaction from my fans and the fashion press!'

Rihanna's foray into the fashion world, if she pulls it off as planned, won't be the first time a singer has successfully made the leap from music to fashion design.

Former Spice Girl, Victoria Beckham, has proved to be an enormously talented designer and has produced a string of critically acclaimed collections.

Justin Timberlake's William Rast line has also confounded expectations and has achieved mainstream success, particularly in the US.

But not all have done so well. Beyonce's House of Dereon was panned for being poorly designed and looking cheap, although husband, Jay-Z's Rocawear line is believed to sell well.

One collection unlikely to appeal to most Rihanna fans is the 'Black Pyramid' clothing line, which was launched by the singer's violent on/off boyfriend, Chris Brown, last November.

According to Brown, who designed the 'artwork' splashed across the front of the t-shirts in the range, the line reflect an 'unknown' part of him.

'We really haven’t mastered the art of making a pyramid ourselves, like the ancient ones,' he waffled.

'The black pyramid label is basically an unknown art. So I think my painting, my designs, whatever I do fashion wise is unknown to a lot of people.'

Although Rihanna's collection is 
likely to be considerably more stylish - and certainly less bizarrely 
described -  fashion fans will have to wait until March to get their 
hands on the pieces.

What form they will take is still 
shrouded in mystery although Rihanna has let slip the odd hint via 
Twitter, and was pictured wearing a blue boilersuit from the collection 
in November.

Needless to say, if they're anything 
like the singer's own colourful style, summer on the streets of the UK 
looks set to be very bright indeed - whatever the weather does!

The good, the bad and the dreadful: Although the work of Victoria Beckham (right) has met with widespread acclaim, the dreadful Chris Brown (left) has created a line that can be described in a single word: bad
