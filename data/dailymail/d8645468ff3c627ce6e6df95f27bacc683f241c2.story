Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi, jailed following the Lockerbie bombing told investigators that he travelled to Malta to have sex (file photo)

Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi, the Libyan jailed for life following the 1988 Lockerbie bombing told investigators that he regularly travelled to Malta to have sex.

Megrahi's claims came as he tried to 
explain his presence in Malta to investigators, and are detailed in 
secret documents which have been seen by BBC Scotland.

He said he was able to visit 
and leave Malta without a passport or identification because of his 
position at Libyan Arab Airlines.

Malta was key to the case which saw Megrahi, convicted, in January 2001, of murdering 270 people in the plane explosion. 

Prosecutors believe the suitcase in which the bomb was hidden, was loaded on to a plane in Malta, which then travelled on to Frankfurt, and Heathrow, before finally detonating on Pan Am Flight 103 in the sky above southern Scotland.

Denial: He has always maintained his innocence, and an investigation by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) found he may have suffered from a miscarriage of justice

The 821 page report, includes Megrahi's statement, given to defence lawyers before his trial in which he boasted how easy it was for him to travel between Libya and Malta as well as claiming he had a mistress in the country.

'As a Libyan Arab Airlines employee 
and as someone well known, both at Tripoli airport and at the airport in
Malta,' he told the lawyers.

'I could get away with not using a passport or an identification card 
at all, but simply by wearing my Libyan Arab Airlines uniform.

Defence lawyers realised if the 
original trial had known how easily Megrahi could travel undetected to 
Malta it may have strengthened the prosecution case.

After interviewing Megrahi in Greenock Prison, investigators
discovered he had a mistress in Malta that he may have visited twice in
that month of the bombing, including the night before the plane blew 
up.

He told them he could not have sex with his wife so the SCCRC report stated it was possible he travelled to Malta 'on 20 December to meet a woman for this purpose.'

The report says it was the same woman he said he might have met during his visit to Malta on 7 December.

'He had had sexual relations with her on a number of occasions over several years, until 1989 or 1990.'

In the report Megrahi said:

'If I wanted to do something clandestine in such a way that there would be absolutely no record at all of me going from Tripoli to Malta and back again, I could do it.'

A Maltese shopkeeper, Tony Gauci, identified Megrahi as the man to whom he sold clothes which were later found in a suitcase which had contained the bomb.

He confirmed that Megrahi visited his shop, Mary's House, on December 7, 1988.

But it was the controversial and differing statements about this date which was one of the reasons that led the SCCRC to refer the case back to the Appeal Court.

He was returned to Libya on compassionate grounds in August, 2009, after serving 10 years of a life sentence, when he was given just three months to live.

The
bomber, who has terminal prostate cancer, is still alive in Libya 
two-and-a-half years after his release, to the embarrassment of the 
Scottish Government.

Megrahi has always maintained his 
innocence, and an investigation by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review 
Commission (SCCRC) found he may have suffered from a miscarriage of 
justice.

Megrahi was last seen in December, apparently with just days to live, when he gave an interview from his death bed.

A book entitled Megrahi: You Are My Jury alledges Kenny MacAskill, left, told 
Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi indirectly that he would be let out of jail in 
2009 if he dropped his court case after he was given just three months 
to live

Speaking from his family home in Tripoli, he protested his innocence and asked to be left alone to die from the ravages caused by prostate cancer.

He said he had little knowledge of the circumstances surrounding Gaddafi's overthrow and claimed Libyan opposition fighters had invaded his home and mistreated him.

Some people are adamant that he is guilty and should not have been released from prison, regardless of his illness.

Relatives of those killed in the bombing have tirelessly campaigned against him and last month a spokesman for David Cameron said that the Lockerbie bomber should never have been released.

He said: 'This is yet another 
reminder that Alex Salmond’s government’s decision to free the UK’s 
greatest mass murderer was wrong.'

Whereas other parties have claimed, 
as does Megrahi himself, that he was 'the innocent victim of dirty 
politics, a flawed investigation and judicial folly.'

Meanwhile in the last few weeks allegations have arisen that Scotland’s Justice Secretary told the Lockerbie bomber to drop his appeal to smooth the way for him to be released on compassionate grounds.

Kenny MacAskill allegedly told Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi indirectly that he would be let out of jail in 2009 if he dropped his court case after he was given just three months to live.

Shortly before the official announcement Al-Megrahi did mysteriously abandon the appeal against his conviction - even though he was under no legal obligation to do so.

The allegations - strongly denied by the Scottish government - appeared in a new book published today about the release entitled Megrahi: You Are My Jury.

It claims Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi was the 'innocent victim of dirty politics, a flawed investigation and judicial folly'.

A Scottish Government spokesman branded the book, published today, as 'third-hand hearsay'.

He stated: 'We can say categorically that neither the Scottish Government had any involvement of any kind in Mr Al-Megrahi dropping his appeal, or indeed any interest in it.

'That was entirely a matter for Mr Al-Megrahi and his legal team.'
