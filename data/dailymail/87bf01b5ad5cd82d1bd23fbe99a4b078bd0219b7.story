Michael Schumacher's devoted wife made a rare public appearance today almost eight months after her husband's skiing accident shocked the world.

Corinna Schumacher smiled with spectators at the World Equestrian Games in Caen, France, where she watched the second day of the tournament in her role as an official ambassador.

The 45-year-old is an avid rider and was named as a key face of the championship last month, a role she has bravely managed to fit in between lengthy vigils at her husband's bedside.

Seven-time F1 world champion Michael came out of a medically-induced coma in June and was moved from a hospital in Grenoble, France, to a rehab clinic closer to his Swiss home.

In July Mrs Schumacher, who is said to have spent millions turning part of the family mansion into a medical suite so her husband can return home, revealed Michael was gradually recovering.

She told the German magazine Neue Post: 'It’s getting better, slowly certainly, but in any case it’s improving.'

The comments offered new hope to the 45-year-old racing driver's millions of fans.

The world of motorsport was left stunned when Schumacher hit his head on rocks while skiing in the French Alps on December 29, leaving him paralysed and unconscious for several months.

The recovery is understood to be slow but the driver has shown promising signs of improvement.

Croatian doctors Darko Chudy and Vedran Deletis, who have developed a revolutionary microchip implanting technique, were reportedly approached to see if they could help.

It is believed such a microchip would be able to help the F1 ace walk and talk again after his extended period in a coma.

Mrs Schumacher has been married to the legendary racing driver for 19 years and they have two teenage children.

She was hailed a heroine after her first public appearance since her husband's accident last month.

It was also at a riding event, this time a 'reining' tournament at her Western-style ranch in Givrins, Switzerland. She laughed, smiled and handed out chocolates in a much-deserved moment of respite from the F1 driver's side.

Success: Schumacher has won the F1 championships seven times and is a hero in the world of motorsport

Held every four years, the World Equestrian Games began yesterday in Normandy and offers the first chance for riders to qualify for the 2016 Olympics.

Among the competitors are the Queen's granddaughter Zara Phillips, who has returned to the sport following a seven-month break after her daughter Mia was born in January.

Announcing her support for the championships, Mrs Schumacher said: 'It’s easy to give support to something touching your heart, and animals have always touched mine.

'Horses have therefore been part of my life, even if initially mainly for amateur-fun reasons.

'Being a team with your horse is something great to watch and even greater to work on, and so I feel very excited to be an official ambassador of the Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games 2014 in Normandy. I really look forward to watching some high-class competitions.'
