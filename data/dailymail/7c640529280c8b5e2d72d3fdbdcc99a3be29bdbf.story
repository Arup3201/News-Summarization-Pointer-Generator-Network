A man accused of burning his girlfriend's 5-month-old son so badly that part of the child's left leg had to be amputated has pleaded guilty to a felony assault charge in central Ohio.

Twenty-year-old Zachariah Keen, of Mount Vernon, entered the plea Tuesday in Knox County court, avoiding a scheduled trial. Two child endangering charges were dismissed. 

Guilty: Zachariah Keen, pictured, pleaded guilty to a felony assault charge on Tuesday. Keen was accused of burning his girlfriend's 5-month-son so badly part of the child's leg had to be amputated

Girlfriend: Mother Lora Miller's baby also needed skin grafts on one arm

According to Fox28, Keen said 'I was going to give him a bottle and I heated it in a microwave for too long of a time.'

'I then had this occurrence and the baby was burned,' he also said. 'And I did not seek help right away because I did not know the severity of the burn at the time.'

The affiliate station reported '[t]he child's father Zach Hammons appeared angry and had tears streaming down his face during Keen's confession.' 

Fox28 reported the child is in Hammon's custody. 

Keen will be sentenced next month. A message left with his attorney from the Associated Press wasn't immediately returned.

Prosecutors have said Keen told police he tripped and spilled a baby bottle of hot water while baby-sitting in mid-January, but authorities didn't believe the second- and third-degree burns were accidental.

Keen was accused of knowingly hurting and failing to seek appropriate medical help for the child, who also needed skin grafts on one arm.

In January following the incident, the baby's mother Lora Miller told Mount Vernon News 'the burn is to the bone.' 

Last month, Keen said on Facebook he is expecting a child with Miller and uploaded photos that purportedly show her sonograms.
