An entire Miami-Dade Police squad in Kendall has been disciplined after officers were caught out kissing girlfriends, shopping and drinking coffee while ignoring emergency calls including attending to an unconscious five-month-old baby.

One sergeant and two officers have been sacked for dereliction of duty, while three others have been suspended without pay.

The embarrassing incidents, which were caught by Internal Affairs in 2010, are considered one of the worst incidents of delinquency in the department’s history.

One of the most disturbing cases was when one officer, Dario Socarras, was filmed drinking coffee for nine minutes while allegedly ignoring emergency dispatch orders on a call for an unconscious five-month-old baby.

Neglected: The officer's ignored the urgent call to help the child - they were meant to rush to the scene using sirens and blue lights as it was classified as an emergency

He was also reportedly seen twice

his girlfriend - video shows the pair kissing and cuddling as other 
officers were forced to respond to the emergency calls for help.

Other criticisms include not immediately
responding to a call where a five-year-old child was locked inside a 
vehicle and investigators allege that Huerta would claim to be tied up 
on a call, such as a traffic accident, when in fact he was free to 
respond to calls the dispatcher had waiting.

His
supervisor, Sgt. Jennifer Gonzalez, was also recorded ignoring her 
duties as one video shows her shopping while on duty at stores like 
Target and Lowes.

She was even seen being helped by a store assistant to load her purchases into a squad car.

Her issues include her brushing off work to rendezvous with her boyfriend, and visiting her parents in Cutler Ridge, far away from her patch, when she should have been on the job, according to CBS.

NBC6 confirms Socarras, Gonzalez, and Officer Jose Huerta have been fired, according to MDPD internal affairs documents, and others have been disciplined.
