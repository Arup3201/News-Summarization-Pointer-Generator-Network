Scotland's richest woman has been blasted by campaigners after she closed a Battle of Britain airport she purchased for just £1 and vowed to keep open for at least two years.

Ann Gloag purchased Manston Airport in Kent in November for the nominal fee, but had to accept £23 million worth of loans inherited from the previous owners.

In November, Ms Gloag vowed to keep the airport operating but within six months it has closed.

Scottish Millionaire Ann Gloag purchased Manston Airport in November 2013 and pledged to keep it open for at least two years

However, the airport's owners entered into a consultation process with staff in March about the future of the facility

The airport closed for what could be the final time on May 15

There are now plans to under consideration to built 1,000 homes on part of the site.

It is understood that shortly before the closure, the airport's owners rejected a £7 million takeover bid to secure the future of the facility.

Mrs Goag is the founder of transport company Stagecoach and is understood to be worth an estimated £500 million.

Manston Airport was developed as an aerodrome during World War I as a base for the newly created Royal Flying Corps.

It was also used by Sir Barnes Wallace to develop his 'bouncing bomb' which was used during the Dam Busters raid.

Speaking at the time of the purchase, Mrs Gloag said: 'I am delighted to have purchased Manston Airport from Infratil as I believe there is real potential for growth that has not been fully captured.

'I have said for 25 years now that the airport will never really succeed until we have a one-hour link from London to Manston. That is achievable and on track.' 

The Save Manston Airport group claim that the airstrip is a vital piece of infrastructure in the South East

During the Second World War RAF Manston was right at the front for the Battle of Britain and was used by Sir Barnes Wallace to test his bouncing bomb used in the Dam Busters Raid

However, on March 19, the management advised staff that they were entering 'a period of consultation over the possible closure of the airport'.

The announcement prompted KLM to suspend its twice daily flights between Manston and Amsterdam. The service began operating shortly before Mrs Gloag purchased the facility. 

Local residents and trade unions have expressed outrage over the closure which will cost almost 600 jobs in the Thanet area.

Some residents want Thanet District Council to lodge a compulsory purchase order on the airstrip.

The council has tasked an official will investigating the possibility and senior officials plan to meet Mrs Gloag to discuss her plans.

A spokesperson said: 'The council has been clear that it supports activity that retains the existing footprint of the airport as an airport, and was disappointed that recent bids to save Manston were not successful.

'The council is also keen to dismiss recent inaccurate reports regarding discussions between the council and airport owners to develop housing on the existing footprint of the airport.'

According to the Save Manston Airport Group, the facility is only 20 minutes from Brussels and 35 minutes from Amsterdam

Commenting on development plans, the council said: 'The owners of Manston Airport put forward a proposed site for allocation as part of the Local plan discussions, where options for the "Northern Grass" (redundant land - not currently used for airport activity) were raised, including the possible development of housing.

'However, as the proposal does not fit in with the council’s current approach to allocating housing sites, no decision, or indication that this would have been an acceptable proposal was made by officers.

'As part of this discussion, there was no reference to any plans to change the use of the airport or to develop the land which is used for airport activity.'

A spokesperson added: 'The council has consistently recognised Manston Airport as an important economic asset for the district and has been explicitly clear of its commitment to work alongside the Thanet MPs and Kent County Council as part of a task force to support the retention of the airport.'

Speaking to The Observer, Ian McCoulough of Unite who represent the airport's fire fighters said: 'She just wanted to strip the value of the land and the properties on it.'

The paper said Mrs Gloag refused to comment about her future plans for the airport.

According to the Save Manston Airport action group, if the facility is shut down permanently it will likely be developed into either 'shoebox houses' or retail park.

A spokesperson said that more than 14,000 people have signed a petition to counter the closure.

According to the group: 'The airfield is largely undeveloped and could suit a variety of uses, only being 20 minutes flying time from Brussels and 35 minutes to Amsterdam.'

Last week several hundred people marched to the airport demonstrating against its continued closure. 

Residents fear that the 700 acre site will be used to build homes.
