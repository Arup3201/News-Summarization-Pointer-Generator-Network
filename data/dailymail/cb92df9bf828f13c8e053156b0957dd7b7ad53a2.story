Celebrity mothers Peaches Geldof (who updates her Instagram by the second with information about son Astala), Kourtney Kardashian (who relishes every opportunity to wear clothes matching those worn by children Mason and Penelope Disick) and Lily Cooper (who has been caught Tweeting that  life is all dirty nappies and pureed food since the birth of daughters Ethel and Marnie), take heed.

Baby-related social media updates, wearing clothes that match your child's, and bemoaning a lack of social life thanks to your growing brood have been voted the parenting habits we find most irksome.

Being forced to listen to a newborn's gurgling down the phone and hearing friends do cutesy voices for their infants are also high on the list of annoying parental pastimes, according to a survey.

From feeding habits to his friendship with Parpy the dog, Peaches Geldof loves sharing information, photos and anecdotes about her son Astala via Instagram and Twitter

Not disciplining unruly tots in public and swearing in front of your children also made the list of the most irritating traits of mothers and fathers, according to myvouchercode.co.uk.

The survey also found 
that British people aren't keen on parents who wax lyrical about how 
perfect their children are... and are equally put out when they 
criticise other people's.

Mark Pearson, My Voucher Code chairman, said: 'It can be tricky to admit to 
your friends what you find annoying about their parenting habits, even 
more so if you don't have children yourself as they could return the 
criticism by blaming you for not understanding what being a parent feels
like.

'I guess all you can do is try to see the funny side of these 
things. And I'm sure even if most of us will agree to find at least one 
of these things annoying, we'll all end up doing the same once we have 
children.'

Not disciplining unruly children and swearing in front of them also irritate
