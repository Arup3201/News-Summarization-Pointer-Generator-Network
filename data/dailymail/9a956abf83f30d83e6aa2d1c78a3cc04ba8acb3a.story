This is the little boy who could be killed by a nursery rhyme.

Tiny Jayson Hart, aged nine months, was born with a rare heart condition that means his heart could stop at any minute if he is shocked or startled.

It means his mother Kelley Hart, from Hockley, Essex, cannot read him favourite nursery rhymes, such as Ring a Ring o' Roses, in which there are sudden loud noises.

Jayson was born in November 2013 with Long QT Syndrome. It is a rare inherited heart condition which increases the risk of 
irregular heartbeats, which can lead to fainting and sudden death.

Miss Hart, 25, who also has the condition, said: ‘We have to be very careful with Jayson. We can’t sing any loud nursery rhymes to him and we have to be very careful with some of them if there are any sudden loud noises or clapping.

'We have to read things to him very gently and only clap very quietly and slowly.

‘He can’t have any squeaky toys, no loud rattles and we have to keep him away from balloons, so he can’t go to children’s parties where there are balloons. Anything with a loud noise can stop his heart.’

Jayson was diagnosed at birth with the condition. The young boy's condition can be 
triggered by a change in temperature meaning he cannot run into the sea or 
jump into a cold swimming pool.

The family have not got a telephone or a doorbell as even these loud sudden noises could also fatally shock him. He is also unable to go on fairground rides.

Jayson Hart was born with Long QT Syndrome, a rare heart condition, which means his heart could stop if he is shocked or startled

Miss Hart, who lives with partner Greg
 Allen, 27, a construction worker, was diagnosed with the condition at the age of 10, after she fainted several times.

She said: ‘I collapsed the first time 
when I was swimming in a local pool.

'I’d
 just pushed off from the side of the pool when everything went black. I
 came round to find myself lying on the edge of the pool with a foil 
blanket wrapped around me.

'I was told that I’d passed out in the water and had sunk to the bottom of the pool before being hauled out.

‘Mum rushed me straight to the doctors 
but it took six months of tests to finally found out what was wrong with
 me. And I collapsed several further times during those months.’

Miss Hart was diagnosed with Long QT 
Syndrome and was fitted with a pacemaker, which will restart her heart should it 
stop.

Long QT syndrome is a rare and serious heart condition. It occurs in about 1 in 2,000 people.

The syndrome can cause fainting as well as episodes of an abnormally rapid heart rhythm, called arrhythmia.

The arrhythmia happens because the electrical activity of the heart is disrupted.

These episodes may be provoked by any sort of adrenalin rush through the body, often caused by a shock or start.

Not everyone with long QT syndrome will experience arrhythmia, but when it does happen it can be fatal. 

LQTS can be genetically inherited, but it can also be caused by some medications which patients might be taking for other medical conditions.

She and Mr Allen were thrilled when she fell pregnant, but were 
worried that their baby would inherit the deadly condition.

She
 said: ‘We were just terrified that the baby would inherit it from me. 
When Jayson was born by caesarian section we were thrilled, but then 
when he was only a day old, tests confirmed that he had the condition 
too.

'We were devastated. I was glad that they had discovered it early, 
but terrified about what the future meant for him.’

Jayson’s condition is currently being controlled by medication, but he may have to have a pacemaker fitted as he grows older.

But the family still have to be careful not to give him a sudden shock.

Miss Hart said: ‘My mother was babysitting recently and a glass shattered and the shock of the noise made him turn blue.

'Mum picked him up and the colour came straight back, but we can never be too careful with him.’

Miss Hart added: ‘He can’t do anything that would cause adrenaline to surge around his body, so that also means that he can’t go on an fairground rides.

'When its bonfire night we will have to fit him with special sound proof ear muffs as the loud bang of the fireworks could prove fatal.’

Both his parents have been trained in CPR, although so far they have not needed to resuscitate him.

Miss Hart added: ‘Greg and I are always on red alert in case anything happens and we have to save Jayson’s life.

'We have to be so careful and constantly be on the look out for things that could shock him. We try to let him live as normal a life as possible, but it can be difficult.’
