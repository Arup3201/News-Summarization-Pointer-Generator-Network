A mother who abandoned her four young children in a hotel room to go out partying has been banned from having any more babies.

Kimberly Lightsey agreed not to have any more children in return for avoiding five years in jail.

A judge in Bartow, Florida offered the 30-year-old the unique plea deal as a condition of her probation.

Ban on babies: Kimberly Lightsey, 30, has been told not to have any more children as a condition of her parole after she left her four offspring in a hotel room to party in Florida

Lightsey looked at her boyfriend after Circuit Judge Ernest Jones Jr offered her the deal.

When the single mother hesitated and said she wanted more children, the judge said: 'But you've got four of them.'

Lightsey agreed to the plea deal which means she cannot get pregnant in the next 13 years - the length of her probation.

The court heard how Lightsey had left her children, aged from one to 11 years old, alone in a hotel room in Winter Haven, Florida.

Another guest at the hotel tipped off police after hearing crying coming from the bedroom and an overturned stroller in a hallway.

Sentenced: Lightsey escaped a five-year jail term by agreeing not to have another child - a condition set by the judge

One of her children suffers from epilepsy and cerebral palsy and needs constant care.

At the time, Lightsey was serving four years of probation after pleading no contest to child abuse. She had been charged with hitting her six-year-old son in the face with a belt in 2009.

When police entered the hotel room they found it in 'complete disarray' with trash, food and clothing strewn everywhere.

The eldest child said a woman called Simone was supposed to be looking after them. She was tracked down by police but told investigators she did not know what room the children were staying in.

Lightsey was arrested when she returned to the hotel room. All of her children were taken into care before being placed with relatives.

As well as 13 years probation, Lightsey was also placed under house arrest for two years and ordered to carry out 100 hours of community service.

She was also banned from having any unsupervised contact with minors.

The judge agreed that Lightsey could have more children in the future if she is able to fulfill various conditions of her probation and successfully petitions the court to remove the 'no unsupervised contact with minors' clause.
