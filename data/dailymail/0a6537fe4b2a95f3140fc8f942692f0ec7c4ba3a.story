Gary Porter, leader of the Tory group at the Local Government Association, says cuts to frontline services such as rubbish collections are inevitable 

Bins could be collected just once a month across large parts of Britain, a senior Tory council leader warned yesterday.

Gary Porter said cuts to frontline services such as rubbish collections were inevitable after funding for local authorities was slashed again.

Council chiefs said Communities Secretary Eric Pickles’ latest cuts – part of wider plans to tackle Britain’s budget deficit – would reduce funding by around £2.6billion next year.

But Mr Porter, leader of the Conservative group at the Local Government Association, said years of cuts meant budgets were already facing huge pressure from rising school rolls and soaring social care costs.

A handful of councils are already considering a move to general rubbish collections every three or four weeks to save money.

Mr Porter, leader of South Holland District Council in Lincolnshire, suggested the number is now almost certain to rise.

‘To a certain extent we are our own worst enemy – we have managed the reductions really well,’ he said.

‘We are getting reductions out of the services people don’t really bother about. But we can’t keep doing that – another £3billion [of] cuts will be pushing some councils close to the edge.

'Some of our councils, probably 60 or 70 per cent, will start reducing services that people notice next year.

‘Already some of our members are talking about emptying the dustbins once every four weeks. People will notice that.’

The warning is a blow to Mr Pickles, who is under fire for failing to keep his pledge to restore weekly bin rounds.

A spokesman for the minister said they still had scope to make ‘sensible’ cuts without hitting services. She added: ‘This settlement is fair and a lot better than local government was expecting.

'Refuse collections are negotiated over a period of years so any council trying to use this an excuse to move to monthly collections is trying to play politics and not being honest with taxpayers.’

Government sources last night accused councils of scaremongering, and said local authorities were still sitting on large reserves.

But shadow local government secretary Hilary Benn said there was mounting evidence that cuts are driving reductions in bin collections.

Rubbish: Problems are piling up, with council chiefs warning more councils will consider doing bin collections every three or four weeks 

Mr Benn said: ‘Eric Pickles used to boast that he would protect weekly bin collections – then he was found out. Now even Tory council leaders are saying he has failed and that his policies are actually making things worse.’

Earlier this month, the Daily Mail revealed families are now having to wait an average 12 days to have their general rubbish collected.

A survey of local authorities found just 6 per cent now collect all bins on a weekly basis.

Council chiefs say Eric Pickles' latest cuts will reduce funding by around £2.6bn next year 

This despite the Conservatives’ repeated pledge that they would restore people’s ‘fundamental right’ to have their bins emptied once a week. Mr Pickles and David Cameron have spent almost a decade pledging to restore the weekly bin round.

In office Mr Pickles unveiled a £250million fund to help councils deliver on the pledge – but the number of councils operating weekly bin rounds has continued to decline.

A number of councils have already floated the idea of restricting household rubbish collections to once every three or four weeks.

But Doretta Cocks, founder of the Campaign for Weekly Waste Collection, said: ‘It’s one thing talking about doing monthly collections in the winter, but in the summer there will be all sorts of problems.

‘The obvious one is odours, but there are also problems with maggots because of infiltration by flies.’

Yesterday it emerged Mr Pickles has also lost a Coalition battle to force councils to hold a referendum if they want to increase council tax bills by more than 1 per cent.

The move was opposed by the Lib Dems, and the existing 2 per cent level will now be kept.

But, for the fifth year in a row, councils will be offered cash to help them freeze council tax bills if they want.

Announcing the settlement in the Commons, the local government minister Kris Hopkins said councils’ overall spending power would be trimmed by just 1.8 per cent – one of the smallest cuts since 2010.

Mr Hopkins said no council would lose more than 6.4 per cent of its total spending. But the Local Government Association said central funding for councils was being slashed by 8.6 per cent.

Buckinghamshire County Council leader Martin Tett warned of ‘cutbacks in a whole range of areas that people are going to really start noticing now’.
