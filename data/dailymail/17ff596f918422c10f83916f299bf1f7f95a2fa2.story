A former Victorian jam factory - which still smells faintly of strawberries -  has been put on the market for £2.25million.

The massive 8,000sq ft former factory in Peckham has full planning permission to be turned into four separate three-storey houses, complete with studio space, gardens and access to the former workshop.

Residents close to the huge building, in south east London, say it still gives off a faint but pleasant smell of fruit when the weather is sunny.

A spokesperson for estate agents Wooster and Stock said: 'This is a fantastic opportunity to own over 8000sq ft of space, including the workshop of a Victorian jam factory.'
