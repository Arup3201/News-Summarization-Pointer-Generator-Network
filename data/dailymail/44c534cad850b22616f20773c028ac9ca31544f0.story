Newcastle will make an external appointment in their search for a new head coach with Steve McClaren and Remi Garde the leading candidates to replace Alan Pardew.

Sportsmail understands that reports of shortlists as big as eight men being drawn up are exaggerated and managing director Lee Charnley and chief scout Graham Carr have instead narrowed their targets.

Derby County’s McClaren is the only domestic-based boss being considered and, despite denials from Rams chief executive Sam Rush, he could yet end up at St James’ Park, albeit with a compensation package agreed.

Former Lyon head coach Remi Garde is also being considered by Newcastle

United, though, would not have to pay a penny in severance for former Lyon chief Garde. The ex-Arsenal defender left Lyon at the end of last season after three years in charge and, like McClaren, fits the bill of ‘head coach’ the Magpies want to take care of first-team affairs.

Caretaker boss John Carver, meanwhile, has not been told if he will be in charge for Saturday’s trip to league leaders Chelsea.

He will take training on Tuesday but as of Monday night night there was no word from the club’s hierarchy as to whether he will still be at the helm come the weekend.

Carver – who has applied for the position – looks set to start Tim Krul at Stamford Bridge - should he be picking the team - after the goalkeeper returned to training on Monday.

The Dutch No.1 has been absent since injuring his ankle in November and was expected to be sidelined until the end of January.

Newcastle have conceded 21 times in his absence and rookie replacement Jak Alnwick could well have played his last game for the club with his contract up in the summer.

Carver, though, praised the 21-year-old.

‘He's had a bit of a tough time with the goals that we've conceded and I've felt a little bit sorry for Jak, but he's been a strong lad,’ he said.

‘He's stood up to it. It's not easy when you're a young lad and you've got to be able to deal with the pressure, because it takes a special type of player to play at this football club and if you can't handle the pressure of the 52,000 every other week then you'll not survive here.’
