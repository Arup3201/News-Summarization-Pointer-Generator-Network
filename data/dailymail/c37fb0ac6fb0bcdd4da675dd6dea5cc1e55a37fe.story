The parents of two teenage girls struck by a car, which killed one of them and seriously injured the other, have expressed sympathy for the teacher who was driving.

Kalie Gill, 15, and her sister Lindsey, 12, were at a church festival in Yonkers, New York, on Friday night when Roseanne Piccirilli lost control of her Jeep.

As they maintain a vigil by the hospital bed of Lindsey, who has not yet been told her big sister is dead, the Gill family have said they have no animosity to Mrs Piccirilli.

Family tragedy: Sisters Lindsey and Kalie Gill were hit by a car at a carnival, which killed Kalie

'She’s a good woman, a good person and she didn’t mean to do this,' Karen Gill told LoHud News. 'I believe it was a freak accident. I just wish her well.'

Her husband Damien added: 'It’s something she’ll have to live with too.'

It was just after 9pm on Friday that the sixth grade teacher lost control of her Jeep, causing it to plow into the carnival crowd, killing Kalie and injuring her sister and two others.

Lindsey suffered serious injuries including a broken femur, and has undergone several operations since the crash.

'She’s a tough one. She’s a fighter,' Mr Gill said, adding: 'She has been under sedation
 and has been in pain.'

Mrs Piccirilli reached out to the family in a statement, and thanked them for their compassion.

'I am grateful for the kindness they 
have shown in their public statements, and cannot even imagine the sense
 of loss that they feel,' the 55-year-old's statement said.

'My
 family and I are praying for the recovery of Lindsey and ask that God 
will watch over her and over the soul of her sister Kalie. This is a wonderful family, and what has happened is so very tragic.'

Father James Healy said moments after the fatal incident Mrs Piccirilli told him she had been unable to stop, News 12 Westchester reported.

'She
 said the car wouldn't obey when she was putting her foot on the brake. 
She said it felt like she was putting her foot on the accelerator,' he 
said.

The St Paul Apostle teacher had been on the way to the carnival, where she had volunteered to help out.

Police have taken the 2002 Jeep away for analysis and took a routine blood sample from the teacher, who had no previous traffic violations on her driving record.

Relatives of the Gills have been flying in from their native Ireland to help the family through their grief.

The family had only just returned to the Bronx area of New York over the summer after spending several years in Co Leitrim, Ireland.

Both Kalie and Lindsey had been born in the U.S. when the family first relocated with older sister Jamie, now 21, in the 1990s.

'Kalie was wonderful, the best. Just perfect,' Mrs Gill, a stay-at-home mother, told the Irish Voice.

The 15-year-old sophomore and her younger sister were incredibly close and always together. Lindsey has not yet been told that Kalie died in the crash.

'There’s enough going on with her right now that she doesn’t need to know,' Mr Gill, a carpenter, said.

Tributes and a touching YouTube film dedicated to the memory of the popular St Barnabas schoolgirl have been set up.

Yonkers' Irish-American community has also rallied to support the grieving family.

'People have been so kind,' Mr Gill said. 'We could feed the whole hospital with all of the donations of food we’ve gotten.'

Lieutenant Patrick McCormack said it could be months before crash investigators know what happened. 

He has not said how far Mrs Piccirilli's car traveled and said witnesses were still being interviewed. 

Skid marks were visible on the sidewalk, next to a flowers, pictures and messages of sympathy for Kalie and her sister.
