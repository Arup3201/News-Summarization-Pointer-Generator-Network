A dripping wet mystery woman buried her head in the sand in a bizarre apparent protest at Bondi beach in front of baffled onlookers including life guards from the Bondi Rescue TV show.

The woman first came to attention when, looking tired and emotional and dripping wet in a red cocktail dress, she dropped to her knees just behind a lifeguard sitting on a quad bike on the iconic beach and started digging a hole.

Trent 'Maxi' Maxwell, one of the stars of Bondi Rescue TV show, witnessed the woman's bizarre behaviour

The woman then began brandishing a small reading 'NO GAS', waving it in the air in front of the life guard before wandering off along the Bondi esplanade.

The life guard was Trent 'Maxi' Maxwell, one of the stars of the popular TV show Bondi Rescue, who was nonplussed by the episode.

She appeared to be protesting the use of Coal Seam Gas, a naturally occurring substance which can only be accessed through mining.

The woman was not deemed to be a threat to the public, and no police action was taken. 

A spokesperson for Waverley Council said the woman did not cause any trouble so there was no issue.

Maxwell, who has been with the Bondi Rescue team for the past five years, said it was far from the strangest scene he has scene on the beach, a drawcard for tourists and partygoers from around the world.

He said his most memorable moment was a double rescue that happened just in time to save the pair of struggling swimmers. 

The Bondi Rescue team rescue over 5000 members of the public every summer, and deal with other situations including lost children, thieves, drunk revelers, and shark scares. 

The woman was holding a yellow sign which read 'NO GAS'
