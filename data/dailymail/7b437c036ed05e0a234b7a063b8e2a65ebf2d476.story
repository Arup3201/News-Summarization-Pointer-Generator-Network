A man has agreed to tear down a backyard shooting range he made with pallets and piles of dirt after a hospital bought him a year-long pass to a local gun range.

Using cinder blocks, pallets and mounds of dirt, 21-year-old Joseph Carannante built a 4ft-high bullet-stopper in his back yard which he planned to practice shooting at with a 9mm pistol.

He claimed he was unable to reach the local firing range during opening times because he worked up to 16 hours a day.

But furious opposition from neighbours prompted both a hospital and radio host to independently buy him passes to two gun clubs.

Mr Carannante, who lives in St Petersburg, Florida, told Fox News: 'My intentions were never to instill fear in my neighbors. It’s a poorly written law, and I do believe it should be changed.'

Due to Florida laws restricting local communities from forming their own gun laws, his plan was entirely legal.

But he has now agreed to remove the target - which he said he never ended up at shooting at.

His immediate neighbours were shocked when they heard of his plans and voiced  concerns that it was extremely dangerous.

Resident Patrick Leary told WFLA he was furious at Mr Carannante's plans for a backyard shooting range.

He said: 'You heard him say, I'll tell the neighbors when I'm getting ready to fire. What, do we gather our children and hide? Ridiculous.'
