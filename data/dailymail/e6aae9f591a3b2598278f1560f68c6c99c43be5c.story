Crown Prince Felipe ascended to the Spanish throne at the stroke of midnight, after his father King Juan Carlos tearfully signed his own abdication into law.

By royal standards, the ascension of King Felipe and his wife Queen Letizia was humble affair, with reception guests served hot and cold tapas-style nibbles, to be eaten while standing.

There was no champagne, just sparkling cava wine from Spain's Catalonia region.

The economic crisis that has left a quarter of Spaniards out of work prompted Europe's newest king to be relatively frugal at his proclamation.

Juan Carlos yesterday signed legislation, approved by Parliament earlier this month, setting out the legal framework for the handover.

The retiring monarch, who underwent a hip replacement operation last November, used a walking cane and moved with difficulty during the televised signing ceremony.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy immediately ratified the law, which went into force at midnight in Spain.

Felipe is to be formally proclaimed monarch and swear an oath at a ceremony with lawmakers in Parliament later today. It will be a no-frills event, though the 18th-century Spanish crown and 17th-century scepter will be on display.

After a brief military parade, King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia will take a drive through expected crowds along some of Madrid's most emblematic streets and monuments - such as the Prado Museum and the Cibeles fountain.

The palace acknowledged that the customary pomp had been eliminated 'in keeping with the criteria of austerity that the times recommend.'

The 
reasoning behind that choice is easy to understand, says Emilio de Diego
 Garcia, history professor at Madrid's Complutense University. 

'In
 a time when every expense is examined with a magnifying glass, 
particularly public money, any ostentation would have been criticized' 
he said. 

Juan
 Carlos announced his surprise decision to abdicate on June 2, saying he
 was stepping aside after a four-decade reign to allow for younger royal
 blood to rally the country that is still trying to shrug off a 
double-dip recession and a 26 percent jobless rate. 

During
 most of his reign, the monarch was held in high esteem for his role in 
helping steer the country from military dictatorship to democracy.

He
 took over the throne in 1975, two days after the death of longtime 
dictator General Francisco Franco, and then endeared himself to many by 
making army rebels stand down during an attempted military coup in 
1981.

Today is Spanish King Juan Carlos' last day on the throne before his son ascends and already the shops are packed with memorabilia to celebrate Prince Felipe's coronation

More recently, however, the royal family's image was tarnished by Juan Carlos' 2012 Botswana hunting trip.

Another
 scandal saw Juan Carlos' youngest daughter, Princess Cristina, testify 
this year in the fraud and money-laundering case engulfing her husband, 
the Olympic handball medalist turned businessman Inaki Urdangarin.

Juan 
Carlos won broad support for his handling of Spain's 20th-century 
challenges. Felipe VI must now address Spain's 21st-century 
difficulties. 

Keeping the bill down for taxpayers is just one of the challenges facing the new king. 

Much
 more pressing will be whether he can keep the country united as 
separatist movements, such as those in Catalonia and the Basque region, 
try to pull the country apart.

Such an unraveling could place the 
monarchy itself in danger.

MADRID, SPAIN - JUNE 16:  Prince Felipe of Spain coronation souvenirs are displayed at stores today

Prince Felipe is to be formally proclaimed monarch and swear an oath at a ceremony with lawmakers in Parliament on Thursday

The abdication announcement initially triggered widespread demonstrations calling for a referendum on reinstating a republic.

But
 a recent poll found that while 62 percent of respondents said they 
wanted a referendum on the monarchy 'at some point,' 49 percent said 
they favored a monarchy with Felipe as king, while only 36 percent 
wanted a republic. Others did not answer or expressed no opinion. 

Felipe
 holds a law degree from Madrid's Autonomous University and obtained a 
master's in international relations from Georgetown University in 
Washington.

His wife is a former television journalist and a divorced 
commoner. Many people feel that record will help make Felipe more 
attuned to the public mood.

Diego 
Garcia, the Complutense professor, believes Spain is going to see 'a 
more austere monarchy, one closer to the people and the reality of the 
country.'

The
 2,000 guests invited to the royal reception were from a wide range of 
Spanish society, including Madrid ambassadors as well as representatives
 from the business, cultural, media and sports sectors. 

Authorities have blocked a planned demonstration in Madrid later today by people demanding an end to the monarchy. 

The palace said it had no information on the overall cost of the events, which will be overseen by some 7,000 police.
