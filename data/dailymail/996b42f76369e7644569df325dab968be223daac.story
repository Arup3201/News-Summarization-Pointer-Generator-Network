New attack: Home Secretary Theresa May has accused British judges of being overzealous in their use of the Human Rights Act

Theresa May has launched a fresh attack on British judges accusing them of being overzealous in their use of the Human Rights Act.

The Home Secretary has claimed that the courts in this country go further than the European Court of Human Rights itself when considering immigration appeals.

Mrs May says judges are allowing too many immigrants to stay in the country on the grounds that their relatives might suffer if they were forced to leave.

Thousands of illegal immigrants cite Article 8 of the Human Rights Act – the right to respect for private and family life – to fight deportation.

The Home Secretary’s comments are set to reignite her bitter feud with Justice Secretary Ken Clarke, who has dismissed her suggestion that the British courts are too lenient.

Mr Clarke publicly ridiculed Mrs May after she highlighted a case in which an illegal immigrant’s pet cat was taken into account at the Conservative Party conference earlier this month.

However, defiant Mrs May has continued her onslaught against the Human Rights Act in a letter to Westminster’s joint committee on human rights which is examining judgements.

Mrs May said there was a major divergence in the approach of British judges with the stance of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

Mrs May said that deportation appeals made under article 8 were only upheld by Strasbourg in the ‘most exceptional circumstances’.

In contrast, she went on to cite the case of a woman who was allowed to remain in Britain because she would be forced to live with her mother who ‘she did not feel a close bond’ in Kenya.

One of the judges in the case said that forcing her to return to Kenya was ‘unreasonable’.

The judge also considered whether the woman, who had been in Britain since 2002, would struggle to adjust to Kenyan society and would be able to continue her hobby of singing in a church choir.

She said judges are supposed to consider whether there are ‘insurmountable’ obstacles to families being sent home, the test applied in Strasbourg. But they are increasingly setting weaker tests of their own.

Mrs May wrote: ‘There is now a divergence in approach between the UK courts and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg over whether the family of a person facing removal from the UK can live elsewhere, and the weight given to family relationships formed whilst migrants are knowingly breaking immigration laws.

‘We have wide-ranging concerns with the operation of article 8 in an immigration context’.

The Home Secretary cited another case of a judge found there was no ‘compelling public interest’ in deporting a woman to Jamaica although she had made a mockery of the immigration system.

‘This was his conclusion,  despite the fact (she) originally entered the UK as a visitor, switched into a student category and then married as an overstayer’, Mrs May wrote.

Mrs May’s letter was sent to the committee after it asked for some examples of ‘inappropriate application’ of article 8 in immigration cases.

She added: ‘In a number of more recent cases, the UK courts have substituted for whether there are ‘insurmountable obstacles’ the alternative question of whether it is ‘reasonable to expect’ the family of an applicant facing removal to join him or her in his or her country of origin’.

A spokeswoman for Mrs May said: ‘We don’t comment on leaked documents.’ 

Meanwhile, it has also emerged that Mrs May will speed up the process of removing foreigners involved in British gang crime.

The Home Secretary will this week announce to fast track the deportation of the most dangerous individuals who are involved in crimes such as murder, kidnap, shootings, stabbings and drugs supply.

She will say that a pioneering scheme, which involves police working directly with UK Border Agency Staff and boasts a 100 per cent success rate, will be rolled out across England and Wales.

The news comes after it was disclosed more than 150 people arrested for their role in the summer’s riots were foreigners, and that 13 per cent of all those detained were gang members.
