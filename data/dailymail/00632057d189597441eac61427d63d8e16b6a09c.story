Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has hit back at Sam Allardyce's claim that his team are a long-ball side - and insists he has the facts to prove it.

The United boss turned up for his press conference ahead of Wednesday's match at home to Burnley clutching four sheets of paper that he says rubbish claims Allardyce made after Sunday's draw at West Ham.

The whole scene was a slightly bizarre episode that evoked memories of Rafa Benitez's press conference rant, directed at Sir Alex Ferguson, over referees in 2009.

The statistics quoted in the A4 pamphlet, which were put together by Van Gaal's analysts, claim West Ham sent a higher percentage of their long passes forward than United during the match. The Hammers attempted 200 passes, according to the figures, and United 343.

The pamphlet said 71.1 per cent of West Ham's 'long passes' - of over 25 metres - went forward whereas United's percentage was just 49.9 per cent.

Diagrams in the pamphlet claim to show United's passes went sideways or diagonally, rather than forward.

West Ham made just 11 of their 32 'long and forward' passes during the match, according to boss Van Gaal 

Van Gaal claims United made 49.9 per cent of 'long passes forward' in comparison to West Ham's 71 per cent

This page suggests United played 12 long passes after 76 minutes of their 1-1 draw at Upton Park on Sunday. Eight of them were successful.

'When you have 60 per cent ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls?' Van Gaal asked.

'Yeah, long balls, in the width, to switch the play. You have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls, but long balls wide, rather than to the striker. A ball to the forward striker is mainly caused long-ball play. It is not so difficult also to read that.

'You have to see the data and put the data in the right context I believe.'

Van Gaal talks regularly about the fact that he wants his teams to play attractive football.

He was clearly, therefore, annoyed at Allardyce's comments and he had the pamphlet on his desk waiting when he fielded the first question about the West Ham boss' jibe.

'Because I expected this question, I have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then I have to say that it is not a good interpretation from Big Sam,' said Van Gaal.

Speaking after the match, Hammers boss Allardyce said:'’In the end we couldn’t cope with Long-ball United. It's not how you normally see United play, but it got them a goal in the end.

'You might just criticise Louis van Gaal for playing long balls as much as I’m sometimes criticised for being direct. In the end it’s paid off for them so you can’t knock it.’

The Dutchman however, insisted his team only started launching balls forward after 6ft 4in Marouane Fellaini came on in the 76th minute of the draw in east London.

'I am sorry, but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed, in spite of many chances in the second half, then I changed my playing style.

United's change of tack came after 6ft 4in Fellaini was brought on in the second half,  Van Gaal claimed 

West Ham manager Allardyce was critical of Van Gaal's tactics following Sunday's encounter 

When a colleague of mine is saying this kind of thing then, yeah, you have to see the data and you have to put the data in the right context I believe.

I think the media is also coming to the match and you have a lot of opinion about me, or the game, or the players and now you say that you have no opinion. 

When you have 0 per cent ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls? Yeah, long balls, in the width, to switch the play. You have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls, but long balls wide, rather than to the striker.  A ball to the forward striker is mainly caused by long-ball play. 

Because I expected this question, I have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then I have to say that it is not a good interpretation from Big Sam. 

It is not so difficult also to read that. I am sorry, but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed, in spite of many chances in the second half, then I changed my playing style. 

Then, of course, with the quality of Fellaini we played more forward balls and we scored from that, so I think it was a very good decision of the manager. 

But, when you see overall the long ball, and what is the percentage of that, then West Ham have played 71 per cent of the long balls to the forwards and we 49. 

So, I give you this and you can see that the blue ones are the good ones because long balls are also very difficult, which is why I began with the explanation of ball possession. 

When you have 60 per cent ball possession you cannot play long balls. So again, they did it 71 and we 49, and I give it you, you can copy it and then maybe you can go to Big Sam and he will get a good interpretation. 

'Then, of course, with the quality of Fellaini we played more forward balls and we scored from that, so I think it was a very good decision of the manager.

'But, when you see overall the long ball, and what is the percentage of that, then West Ham have played 71 per cent of the long balls to the forwards and we 49.'

After reeling off the statistics, Van Gaal rose from his chair and handed the pamphlet to the reporter who asked the question about Allardyce.

The United boss then asked them to analyse the last three pages, which contained diagrams which contained coloured arrows pointing in the direction of both team's passes.

'I give you this and you can see that the blue ones are the good ones because long balls are also very difficult, which is why I began with the explanation of ball possession,' the 63-year-old said.

'When you have 60 per cent ball possession you cannot play long balls. So again, they did it 71 (per cent) and we 49, and I give it to you, you can copy it and then maybe you can go to Big Sam and he will get a good interpretation.' 

Rafa Benitez infamously lost his cool at Sir Alex Ferguson during a press conference rant back in 2009 

In 2009, Benitez erupted during a press conference and attacked former United boss Ferguson with some similarly pre-planned 'facts'. Here are some of the best bits...

Benitez said: 'I was surprised by what has been said, but maybe they [Manchester United] are nervous because we are at the top of the table.

'But I want to talk about facts. I want to be clear, I do not want to play mind games too early, although they seem to want to start. But I have seen some facts. On 1 November, they played Hull and Mr Ferguson had a two-match touchline ban and a £10,000 fine after confronting Mike Dean, the referee, for improper conduct.'

'All managers need to know is that only Mr Ferguson can talk about the fixtures, can talk about referees and nothing happens.

'And about his behaviour with referees. The Southampton manager he knows how Mr Ferguson works and how he works, he was very clear. I am not playing mind games, just facts.

'We need to know that I am talking about facts, not my impression. There are things that everyone can see every single week.'

Van Gaal's delivery was calm and he only came to the brink of losing his patience once.

'What do you think?' Van Gaal snapped when first asked about Allardyce's comments, before he regained composure and reeled off his speech on why he thought the former Blackburn manager was wrong.

Van Gaal's overall tactics have come in for criticism this season. United may be fourth in the Barclays Premier League, but the team lacks the energy, dynamism and flair of the Sir Alex Ferguson era.

'I think we have played attractive games and less attractive games,' Van Gaal said. 'You can always improve, you can never have a perfect match.

'I am happy with the results, but I also think we can improve which is also the process. We have talked about already from my first day, but we have to improve.'
