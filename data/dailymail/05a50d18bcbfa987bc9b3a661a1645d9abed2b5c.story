Tory donor: William Ives, 68, was arrested for harassing his ex-wife. He accepted a police caution

A major Conservative Party donor and friend of the Prime Minister has received a police caution for harassing his ex-wife.

William Ives, 68, who has a £266million fortune, is alleged to have bombarded Pearl Adams, 56, with telephone calls for years after their divorce.

The steel tycoon was arrested at his Essex mansion and was released after he agreed to accept a caution.

The donor has given more than £560,000 to the Conservative Party and has attended lunches and Downing Street garden parties with the Prime Minister.

He gives more than £50,000 per year to the party and as a member of the 'Leaders Group' of donors has regular meetings with Mr Cameron and George Osborne.

His ex-wife Pearl, a Marks and Spencer shop assistant, was allegedly abused and threatened during a string phone calls.

However, Ives, who is chairman of Rainham Steel which he founded in 1973, says he only called his ex-wife a few times.

He told police he was only trying to win her back.

Pearl attended lunch in Mr Cameron's Commons office after Prime Minister's Questions and a private dinner for donors in London while she was with Ives.

She was diagnosed with cancer last year and was forced to undergo gruelling chemotherapy sessions.

Ives was arrested at his mansion on April 2 and taken to the nearby Basildon police station for questioning after police refused his offer to come in for questioning voluntarily the following day.

Officers suggested he had been bombarding his ex-wife, from Southend, Essex, with 30 calls per week for two years - but Ives dismissed the claims as rubbish.

The Tory donor met his future wife through a dating agency in October 2004 and wooed her by picking her up in a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce with champagne on their second date.

He also tried to give her a gold bracelet but she refused to take it. He also took her on a series of lavish foreign holidays.

They stayed in the Ritz Carlton in New York together after flying to the U.S. in First Class. Pearl, resigned as an account manager at an IT company in 2006, to marry the steel tycoon.

Pearl, who has two adult children from her previous marriage, had a row with the tycoon on a Caribbean cruise and they split a few months later.

Ives admitted phoning his ex-wife on a number of occasions but denied he had harassed her.

He told the Daily Mirror: 'I accepted a caution on the advice of my solicitor but my gut reaction was not to accept it because I hadn't harassed her in my opinion.

'She's been sending me Valentine's cards for the last few years and, I believe, calling the house up late at night but withholding her number. I've done nothing wrong whatsoever.

'I accept I have made a few calls but nothing like on the scale I have been accused of and I've never left a threatening message.'

He admitted he would still like to be with her - but accepted their relationship was over.

Ives regularly dines with Communities and Local Government Minister Eric Pickles and has given over £10,000 to support his Brentwood constituency party.

The steel tycoon, who left school at 16, has ploughed money into Scunthorpe United football club as their main sponsor.

A spokesman for Essex Police said today: 'Police were contacted on Monday March 19 by a 56-year-old woman from Southend who was reporting that she was being harassed.

'An investigation was launched and a 68-year-old man was arrested at his home in the Brentwood area on April 2.

'He subsequently accepted a police caution after admitting to harassing a woman through a series of telephone calls since July 2009.'

A spokesman for the Conservative Party said they did not comment on private matters.
