Colin Scarisbrick, pictured leaving Liverpool Crown Court, has 30 driving offences dating back 22 years

A van driver who killed a father-of-two in a fit of road rage had caused a death on the roads before, it emerged yesterday.

Colin Scarisbrick tailgated school caretaker Jeff Argent before deliberately ramming his car.

The impact sent the smaller vehicle crashing into a lamppost and Mr Argent, 49, died at the scene in Merseyside.

After Scarisbrick was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving this week it emerged that he has more than 30 motoring convictions dating back to when he was 17.

In 1999 he caused the death of passenger Damien Tudor, 20, after driving at speeds of up to 100mph through the village of Ystalyfera near Swansea.

Father-of-one Mr Tudor died when the car crashed at 70mph – a speed Scarisbrick had reached even after his tyres were deflated by a police stinger device.

But even though Scarisbrick, 39, was jailed for seven and a half years and banned from driving for a decade, he successfully applied to have his licence restored in September 2007.

His other motoring convictions include at least 12 for driving while disqualified, car theft, joyriding and driving with no insurance.

Judge Denis Watson, QC, warned the baker that he faces a ‘substantial’ jail term when he is sentenced for the latest offence next month.

‘You have been convicted of a very, very serious offence on overwhelming evidence,’ the judge said. ‘This is not the first time that you have caused death behind the wheel.’

Liverpool Crown Court was told that Scarisbrick had been on his way to work last October when he encountered Mr Argent’s silver Renault Clio in Formby.

Motorist Jennifer Reid described how Scarisbrick’s red VW van was tailgating the smaller car and seemed to be trying to intimidate the driver.

The two men exchanged words when they pulled up at traffic lights before Scarisbrick cut up Mr Argent at a following roundabout, clipping the passenger side of his car in the process.

The Clio then spun across two lanes, before mounting the pavement and smashing down the lamppost.

Mr Argent, a primary school caretaker in Crosby, died at the scene while Scarisbrick, of no fixed address, sped off to work.

CCTV showed him later checking the paintwork on his van and when he was arrested he asked officers: ‘Is this about that stupid thing this morning?’

He later admitted cutting up the Clio but claimed he feared Mr Argent was going to beat him up.

Speaking after the verdict, Mr Argent’s father-in-law Colin McKenna said: ‘If you’re frightened of somebody, you run away don’t you? Jeff was 6ft 5in tall and had a big heart. He was daft as a brush and was a Mr Softy. We miss him so much.’

Mr Argent had been hailed as a ‘top ambassador’ for his home town of Southport after winning a tourism award.

His wife of 19 years, Debbie, 45, said he was devoted to their two children – Ryan, 20, and 16-year-old Jess.

She added: ‘We were his life and he is ours. Jeff was the life and soul of any party.

‘He had a mischievous sense of humour and would make fun of people to make them laugh. He was a big man with a big personality and had a heart of gold.’

Prosecutor Helen Graves branded Scarisbrick a ‘danger to all road users.’

She added: ‘On that fateful day in October last year, his temper got the better of him again and he drove an innocent man off the road and into a lamppost where he met his death.’
