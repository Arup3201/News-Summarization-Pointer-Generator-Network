Anthony Weiner took a hands on approach at Tuesday's heated New York City mayoral debate and detailed exactly how he'll help get a grip on the city's issues, both big and small.

Weiner used his opening remarks in the televised debate to again apologize for the sexting scandal that knocked him from his perch atop the Democratic pecking order in the New York City race.

‘I have made mistakes,’ he said, often adding hand gestures for emphasis. ‘They have embarrassed myself and hurt my family.’

Pointing the finger: The shamed former congressman proved repeatedly during the debate Tuesday that he's a big fan of little hand gestures

But Weiner's contrite stance ended soon thereafter, as he turned combative while trading barbs with his rivals, including the race's new front-runner, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio; the party's 2009 nominee, ex-comptroller Bill Thompson; and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn.

The night's most searing exchange came when Weiner criticized Quinn's assistance in overturning city term limits in 2009 to give independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg another four years in office.

‘I apologized for my personal behavior,’ Weiner said. ‘The speaker refuses to apologize for overturning the will of the people.’

Quinn, who frequently allies herself with Bloomberg, did what she rarely does on the campaign trail and explicitly brought up Weiner's admission that he traded illicit online messages with women even after he resigned from Congress in 2011 for similar behavior.

‘No New Yorker should be lectured by Anthony Weiner,’ she said. ‘Neither me nor anybody else on this stage ... needs to be lectured by Anthony Weiner about what we need to apologize for.’

Weiner, who's married, remained a lightning rod throughout the hour-long debate.

De Blasio, who moved to first in a poll released hours before the debate, called for Weiner to drop out of the race.

Thompson chided Weiner for not challenging Bloomberg in 2009. And Quinn mocked his congressional record.

The combative exchanges typified the hostile atmosphere on stage among the five candidates, who also included Comptroller John Liu, as the race to replace Bloomberg entered its final, frantic weeks.

If no candidate reaches 40 percent of the vote in the primary, the top two advance to a run-off three weeks later. De Blasio tops the field at 30 percent, followed by Quinn at 24, Thompson at 22, Weiner at 10 and Liu at 6.

With a crowded field making a run-off seemingly inevitable, the candidates jockeyed to land memorable attacks during the debate, the first shown on broadcast TV.

Warm-up: Earlier in the day Tuesday, Weiner spoke at a forum in New York City and warmed up his pointing skills

Quinn, who has been first or second in every poll taken this year, was a frequent target. Her rivals repeatedly hit her not just on the elimination of term limits but for her hopes to retain police Commissioner Ray Kelly even after a judge this week ordered a federal monitor oversee the police department's stop-and-frisk policy.

Thompson called Kelly ‘the face of an abusive policy.’ And Liu said the program, which critics believe unfairly targets blacks and Latinos, ‘was not just unconstitutional but was unconscionable.’

Second chances: Weiner spoke before the debates Tuesday where he's hoping to help snag a political second act

Kelly and Bloomberg credit the policy for driving down crime. Quinn, who drew constant contrasts between her legislative records and her rivals' thin resumes, said she ‘would be lucky’ to keep Kelly as head of the New York Police Department but said she didn't agree with his steadfast defense of stop-and-frisk.

De Blasio, who was an afterthought in the race for much of the summer, repeatedly grabbed the mantle of the campaign's ‘progressive choice.’ And, in one of the debate's few light moments, he revealed that he went to the same Massachusetts high school as former basketball star Patrick Ewing but ‘only one of them made the NBA.’
