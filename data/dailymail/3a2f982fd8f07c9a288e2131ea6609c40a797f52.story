Lord Oakeshott's parting attack on Nick Clegg included the explosive allegation that the Liberal Democrats were embroiled in a potential ¿cash for peerages¿ scandal

Lord Oakeshott's parting attack on Nick Clegg included the explosive allegation that the Liberal Democrats were embroiled in a potential ‘cash for peerages’ scandal.

His statement criticising the party ended with the tantalising claim that his ‘efforts to expose and end cash for peerages in all parties, including our own... have failed’.

He also described the House of Lords as a ‘bloated balloon’ in urgent need of reform.

Lord Oakeshott’s claim may lead to close scrutiny of some of the peerages granted by the Liberal Democrat leader.

Last year Mr Clegg ennobled Ministry of Sound owner James Palumbo – now Lord Palumbo of Southwark – who has donated more than £500,000 to the party over the past nine years.

Domino’s pizza tycoon Rumi Verjee was made Lord Verjee of Portobello after handing over £770,000, some via his company Brompton Capital Ltd.

His donations were investigated by the Electoral Commission in 2012 and cleared.

A party list also revealed Sudhir Choudhrie was put forward for a peerage last summer, after the multi-millionaire’s family and companies gave £1.2million  since 2004, but he was passed over.

Mr Choudhrie, who has been entertained at Mr Clegg’s grace and favour residence, Chevening, was non-domiciled for tax reasons until two years ago, and earlier this year he and his son were quizzed by the Serious Fraud Office as part of a probe into bribery at Rolls-Royce.

Lord Oakeshott’s statement said: ‘When Charles Kennedy rang to make me a peer, he wanted me to shake up the Lords.

Donations: Lord Palumbo, who donated £500,000 to the Lib Dems over nine years

'I’ve tried  – my bills to ban non-dom peers are now law – but my efforts to expose and end cash for peerages in all parties, including our own, and help get the Lords elected have failed. The unreformed Lords is now a bloated balloon…’

Angus MacNeil, the Scottish National Party MP who uncovered the ‘cash for honours’ scandal in 2006 said the claims reignited a row over an upper house ‘full of party donors’.

He said: ‘His claim resurrects this whole scandal, and we need full disclosure of which members of the House of Lords he is talking about, and what they gave in return for a peerage.’

Non-domiciled peers were banned in 2010 under Labour, with cross-party support.

But Mr Clegg’s plans to slash the number of peers from more than 800 to 450, with 80 per cent elected, was dropped after 91 Tory MPs rebelled and Labour refused to back the move.

Lord Oakeshott fired savage parting shots at both Nick Clegg and Vince Cable

The ‘cash for honours’ scandal saw several men who loaned money to Labour – which unlike a donation does not have to be declared – nominated for life peerages.

They were reported to the police by Mr MacNeil. A resulting investigation saw then prime minister Tony Blair questioned by detectives and Labour forced to repay the loans, although no charges were brought.

A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘This is absolute nonsense. Liberal Democrats have never been engaged in cash for peerages.’

An earlier version of this article reported previously published claims that Sudhir Choudhrie is an 'arms dealer'. Mr Choudhrie has contacted us to say that he has repeatedly denied dealing in arms. We are happy to make this clear.
