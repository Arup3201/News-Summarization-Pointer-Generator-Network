His face masked with a  balaclava, war games fanatic Wayne Smith is captured on CCTV as he boards a train en route to murder his love rival.

The IT technician stabbed Jon Britton to death on his front doorstep with a pound-shop carving knife after discovering he was having an affair with his estranged wife.

Smith, 38, made the discovery when he hacked into Sarah Arbon’s Facebook account, then started secretly filming her with webcams.

He tried to cover his tracks by convincing his friend Steven Hatton to give a false alibi that they had been playing the tabletop war game Necromunda on the evening of the murder.

Smith, who was jailed for life for Mr Britton's murder this week, later discarded the clothes he used in the attack, but they were recovered by police and used as evidence

But this week Smith was  convicted of murder and jailed for life, with a minimum term of 28 years.

Liverpool Crown Court heard he had an ‘obsessive hatred’ of Mr Britton, 43, and blamed him for the breakdown of his marriage to Miss Arbon, 36.

They wed in 2010 and had a daughter together. But the relationship deteriorated when he went on long-term sick leave and expected Miss Arbon, an administrator, to look after him while he spent the day playing computer games.

She started a relationship with Mr Britton, a landscape gardener, after realising she was ‘with the wrong man’.

Smith confronted Mr Britton after finding out about the affair, saying, ‘I could kill you’, and posted messages about the relationship on Facebook.

Miss Arbon eventually moved out. She said: ‘I was scared of Wayne. I didn’t love him any more. I loved Jon.’

Smith was filmed on his own CCTV cameras 
leaving his home on December 3 last year, before he made his way to 
Hatton’s house, where he changed into a black hood.

He then took a train to West Kirby, 
Merseyside, where Mr Britton had bought a house to live in with Miss 
Arbon. Two friends who were visiting Mr Britton heard him answer the 
doorbell then cry out.

They found him lying in the hallway while Smith stabbed him up to five times.

Steven Hatton has also been jailed for providing Smith with a false alibi

He used such force the handle snapped off the knife.

Mr Britton was taken to hospital with stab wounds to the neck and chest, but died later that night.

An off-duty policeman walking his dog later found the discarded black clothing and gloves used by Smith, containing his DNA.

Smith denied murder but judge Mrs Justice Susan Carr said  his behaviour was ‘coldblooded and premeditated’.

She said: ‘The motive for this dreadful crime was your obsessive hatred for Mr Britton, whom you saw as having stolen your wife, Sarah Arbon, from you ...Your behaviour in the aftermath of your relationship with Miss Arbon went well beyond normal jealousy.’

She added Smith had used his ‘considerable computer, technical and strategy skills to spy’ on his wife and that he had told the jury ‘a sophisticated, arrogant pack of lies’.

‘Whatever personal and emotional turmoil you were in as a result of the breakdown of your relationship … nothing that the court has been told about you and your circumstances could possibly justify your actions that day,’ she added.

Hatton, 23, admitted assisting an offender and attempting to pervert the course of justice and was jailed for six months.

Necromunda is a table-top war game that was launched in 1995 and followed on from the Warhammer series.

It is made for two to four players, who use 28mm figures to take over different parts of an imaginary post-apolocalyptic terrain.

The game is set in a fantasy land in which creatures have built huge termite mound-type cities to escape the polluted air and reach the upper atmosphere.

The game involves trying to take control of these 'cities' and control the industry of various tribes.

The games characters are divided into six main groups, Orlocks, Cawdors, Delaques, Eschers, Goliaths and Van Saars, although players can purchase others.

The game has become popular with players because of its 3D playing table and intricate building structures.
