Rainer Reinscheid, a professor of pharmacology at the University of California, Irvine allegedly wrote a chilling email in April titled, 'a good plan,' detailing violent revenge on the people he blamed for his teenage son's suicide.

His son hanged himself after being disciplined at high school in March, sending the professor into a downward spiral that authorities said led to setting fires and venting his anger in graphic emails describing plans for a mass murder, sexual assaults and ultimately his own death.

Reinscheid fantasized about buying a dozen machine guns, killing 200 University High School students, raping a school counsellor and killing the assistant principal who disciplined his 14-year-old son, Claas Stubbe, he wrote in several emails obtained by the Associated Press.

'I will make him cry and beg, but I 
will not give him a chance, just like he did to Claas,' Reinscheid 
wrote. 'I will make him die, slowly, surely. Next I will set fire to Uni
High and try to burn down as much as I can, there should be nothing 
left that gives them a reason to continue their miserable school.'

Reinscheid never acted on his most 
violent musings and police have no evidence he was preparing for a 
shooting, but prosecutors charged him with a series of small arsons that
targeted the high school, the assistant principal's home and the park 
where Claas hanged himself.

Five fires erupted between July 1 and
July 19, and police caught Reinscheid as he tried to start a sixth one 
July 24, Irvine police Lt. Julia Engen said.

While investigating the fires, police
discovered three emails Reinscheid sent to his wife and himself in 
April from his university account. Copies of the messages were filed in 
court by prosecutors to have him held without bail. He's due in court 
for arraignment August 8.

In the emails, the distraught father 
asks his wife to forgive him for many disappointments but asks her to 
understand that he 'had to go this way' after detailing plans to kill 
the vice principal and destroy the school in a firestorm.

'You would have done the same if it was your child that you failed,' he wrote to her April 26.

Claas was Reinscheid's son from a 
previous marriage. He has a stepdaughter and son from his second 
marriage. He asked his wife to tell their son, 'Daddy was so sad when 
Claas passed away, he was just eaten away by his sadness and stopped 
breathing.'

Set alight: Prosecutors alleged that the professor started several fires around University High School in Irvine, where his son went until his death in March

Crime and punishment: Reinscheid's son, Claas Stubbe, was forced to pick up trash after stealing from the school store; he later hanged himself

Two nights later, while on medication
to stay awake and 'legally drunk' while downing a second bottle of 
wine, Reinscheid wrote to himself about how he had fantasized about 
having sex with every young girl he saw on campus that day.

Then he discussed his 'dreams' of 
mass murder at the high school, including explicit details of how he 
planned to make a teacher get naked in front of students and stab 
herself with a red pencil before he shot her in the head.

'I will make him die, slowly, surely. Next I try to burn down as much as I can, there should be nothing left that gives them a reason to continue their miserable school.'

'I will give myself a wonderful ending and be with Claas very soon,' he wrote. 'I like this plan, finally a good idea.'

Reinscheid, a professor of 
pharmaceutical sciences who also holds German citizenship, has not been 
charged with anything related to the content of the emails because they 
were private communications, said Farrah Emami, an Orange County 
district attorney's spokeswoman.

Defence attorney Ron Cordova did not 
return multiple calls for comment. He told the judge in court Tuesday 
that he didn't want his client to 'suffer from a media circus.'

Bruce Blumberg, a pharmaceutical 
colleague at UC Irvine, said Reinscheid was angry over the investigation
into his son's suicide and was considering legal action against the 
school district.

'This is all a tragedy,' said 
Blumberg. 'A boy is dead and he shouldn't be and his father is doing 
allegedly crazy things that he shouldn't be doing. It's all a crazy 
situation.'

The son killed himself March 14 after
being ordered to pick up trash for stealing from the student store. 
After the suicide, rumours circulated around school that the teen had 
been bullied, but police and the school district say they found no such 
evidence.

Ian Hanigan, a district spokesman, 
said Reinscheid was angry with school administrators because they 
informed the teen's stepsister of his death at the school, with no 
family members present, after failing to reach anyone on her emergency 
contact list. The school had no other complaints from Reinscheid after 
his son's death and the professor hadn't threatened any school 
administrators.

Blumberg's wife, Dejoie, remains 
close friends with Claas' mother, Doerte Stubbe. She said Claas seemed 
affected by his parents' divorce and split time between Reinscheid and 
his mother, who has multiple sclerosis.

After the boy's death, Stubbe told her Reinscheid said he was writing 'goodbye letters' to everyone.

'At that point she said that she just
didn't care and I figured it was him grieving, venting and that sort of
thing. There was no threat,' Dejoie Blumberg said. 'I figured he was 
very, very and extremely depressed - as any parent would be.'

Longtime friend Olivier Civelli, 
chairman of the pharmacology department, said Reinscheid was devastated 
by his son's suicide but tried to keep it quiet at work. He showed no 
signs of the deep anger evident in the emails.

'Rainer is not a violent person. 
Rainer never had a gun, I can tell you that,' said Civelli, who picked 
up Reinscheid's car after his arrest last week. 'I think that maybe he 
was doing that to vent his anger, he was telling (it) to someone who was
close - his wife.'

That's an argument Reinscheid's 
defence would likely use if the case goes to trial - and perhaps an 
argument that could keep the emails away from a jury entirely, said 
Jacqueline Goodman, a criminal defence attorney.

His attorney will likely argue that Reinscheid never intended to act on his writings, and was simply expressing his anguish.

Knowledge is power: Reinscheid is an associate professor Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences

'You have to take into account the 
context in which these writings come. He's so emotionally distressed and
now he's under the comingled influence of psychotropic drugs and 
alcohol and he's writing these things - not acting on them - just 
writing them down,' Goodman said. 'He's clearly not in his right mind. 
It's like writing in a diary.'

When police searched Reinscheid's 
car, they found a red folder containing a newly signed will and also 
discovered a power of attorney document on his computer that gave his 
wife control over his finances and children, according to a police 
report obtained by The Associated Press.

Reinscheid has been at UC Irvine for 
about a dozen years and rode his bike to work every day from his house 
on campus. His research included studying molecular pharmacology and 
psychiatric disorders, including studies of schizophrenia, stress, 
emotional behaviour and sleep, according to the school's website.

He had requested a leave of absence from UCI, according to a police report.

The college professor, who earned his
PhD in Hamburg, Germany, was arrested in the middle of the night on 
July 24, after Orange County police allegedly caught him trying to start
fires in Mason Park Preserve – the same park where his son had hanged 
himself in March.

Prosecutors accused Reinscheid of 
starting five fires at University High School earlier in July, allegedly
setting fire to various objects such as newspapers, books, fireplace 
logs, and a plastic porch chair.

Reinscheid was arrested last week in connection with the fires and posted $50,000 bail.

However,
after he bailed out, authorities found emails on his cell phone 
addressed to his wife describing a plot to burn down the high school, 
commit sexual assaults and purchase weapons to murder school officials 
and students there before killing himself, according to Orange County 
District Attorney spokeswoman Farrah Emami.

‘This
is unusual, and obviously very alarming. Based on these private emails,
it’s clear that he’s a very dangerous person for wanting to murder 
students and administrators,’ she told MailOnline.
