BBC Director-General George Entwistle sealed his own fate as he was humiliated by his staff in two disastrous interviews yesterday.

The BBC chief received a grilling by respected reporters on BBC Breakfast and Radio 4's Today programme.

During the two interviews Mr Entwistle, forced to resign for 'shoddy journalism' yesterday, revealed his lack of awareness of the Newsnight programme in which Lord McAlpine was wrongly accused of being 
involved in a child abuse scandal.

He claimed he knew nothing about the 
allegations against Lord McAlpine - despite him being a former senior 
Tory - and had only found out about the extent of the accusations on 
Twitter the day after the show's broadcast.

In a tense 15-minute interview with veteran presenter John Humphrys on BBC’s 
flagship Radio 4 Today news programme, Mr Entwistle was told by Humphrys: 'You should go, shouldn't you?'

He also admitted he only saw the Newsnight programme the day after it was aired, saying: 'I was out'.

In a second nine-minute interview with Louise Minchin and Charlie Stayt on BBC Breakfast, he stumbled his way through a series of damning questions.

When asked: 'When did you know as Director-General of the BBC that Lord McAlpine was the figure they were investigating?'

At one point during the humiliating interview, pictured, Stayt said: 'Many people will find it extraordinary that in your position and given what has already happened that you weren't alerted?

He replied, whilst stumbling and repeating his words: 'I
didn't find that out, to be frankly I didn't find that out until it 
became clear from twitter comments and from newspaper coverage during 
this last week. I did not know in 
advance that he was in any sense involved in that Newsnight 
investigation but I had not had that news investigation brought to my 
attention prior to transmission.'

At one point during the humiliating interview Stayt said: 'Many people will find it extraordinary that in your position and given
what has already happened that you weren't alerted?

'Now that seems like
the most extraordinary thing that you, if you like members of the public are finding things out for yourself sat at home while you are looking at the internet, that is an extraordinary situation?'

He admitted the Newsnight report which 
led to the Tory peer being implicated in 
child sexual abuse should not have been broadcast, saying: 'It was our 
responsibility and Newsnight’s responsibility to make sure 
that and misidentification did not end up on Television.

'We did not 
manage to do that and therefore we have to take the blame for that, no 
question'.

And in one key exchange on the Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Humphrys asked: 'When did you know 
that this film was being broadcast and when was it drawn to your 
attention that it was going to make extraordinarily serious allegations 
about a man whose identity would inevitably be uncovered - wrongly, as 
we now know?'

George Entwistle replied: 'The film was not drawn to my attention before transmission.'

It was all too much for him and Mr Entwistle’s stint as Director-General was over, having lasted less than two months.

Mr Entwistle, 50, took over as director general from Mark Thompson on September 17 on a much-reduced salary of £450,000.

Meanwhile, the chairman of the BBC Trust Lord Patten today vowed to fight on to restore confidence in the corporation in the wake of the crisis.

Lord Patten said Mr Entwistle - who dramatically resigned last night - had been 'destroyed' by the botched Newsnight investigation which wrongly implicated a senior former Tory in a child abuse scandal.

However he made clear that he would resist calls to follow suit, insisting his job was to ensure the BBC learned the lessons from what happened and from the inquiries under way into the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal.

He told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show: 'I think that I now have to make sure that, in the interests of the licence fee payer and the audience, that the BBC has a grip, that we get ourselves back onto the road.

'I think that my job is to make sure that we learn the lessons of those inquiries and that we restore confidence and trust in the BBC. If I don’t do that then I am sure that people will let me know.'

Outgoing
BBC director-general George Entwistle was yesterday involved in an 
extraordinary exchange with veteran presenter John Humphrys on BBC’s 
flagship Radio 4 Today news programme.

Here are excerpts from the 
transcript:

JH:
But you must have known what happened because a tweet was put out 24 
hours beforehand telling the world that something was going to happen on
Newsnight that night that would reveal extraordinary things about child
abuse and that would involve a senior Tory figure from the Thatcher 
years. You didn’t see that tweet?GE: I didn’t see that tweet, John,  I now understand...JH: Why not?GE: Well I, uh, I check Twitter sometimes at the end of the day  or I don’t check it at all.JH:
You have an enormous staff of people who are reporting in to you on all
sorts of things – they didn’t see this tweet that was going to set the 
world on fire?GE: Now John, this tweet, I’m afraid, was not brought to my attention, so I found out about this film after it had gone out... JH:
Nobody said to you at any time or to anybody on your staff who would 
then report to you, “Look, we’ve got this Newsnight film going out – 
Newsnight should already light a few bulbs with you surely but – we’ve 
got this film going out that is going to make massively serious 
allegations about a former senior political...” Nobody even mentioned 
it?GE: No. JH: Isn’t that extraordinary?GE:
Well, um, in the light of what happened here, I wish this had been 
referred to me, but it wasn’t and I have to... I run the BBC on the 
basis that the right people are put in the right positions to make the 
right decisions. Now, in this case the film was not signed off in 
Newsnight, legal advice was involved, it was referred to the right 
places in news management and further referral upwards was made...JH: So, when did you find out?GE: I found out about the film  the following day. JH: The following day? You didn’t see it that night when it was broadcast? GE: No, I was out...JH: But you have seen the film now I take it?GE: Yes, I have seen the film now...JH: When did you learn that there were doubts about [Mr Messham’s] testimony? GE: I only found out yesterday when I saw him make his apology to Lord McAlpine that there must be doubts about his testimony. JH:
And you didn’t ask any questions during the course of the week? Because
questions began to be raised very early on in the week as you know. GE: No, John, I didn’t.JH: Do you not think that you should have? GE:
I um... I... there are... the number of things that there are going on 
in the BBC mean that when something is referred to me and brought to my 
attention I engage with it... JH:
We now know Newsnight has failed massively on one programme and it has 
failed massively on another programme and it’s caused the BBC enormous 
damage. You, as you say, as Editor-in-Chief, are ultimately responsible.
Therefore it leads to the obvious question: You should go, shouldn’t 
you? GE:
No John, I’ve been appointed the director-general, the director-general
isn’t appointed only if things are going to go well, the 
director-general is appointed to deal with things which go well and 
things which go badly... JH: Have you given any thought to shutting down Newsnight?GE: No, I haven’t John...
