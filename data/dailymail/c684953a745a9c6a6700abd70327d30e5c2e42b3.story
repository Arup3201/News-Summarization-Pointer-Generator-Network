Russia manager Fabio Capello, who has gone unpaid since June, is likely to get his back-pay in full next month according to Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko.

It was reported earlier this month that Capello has not been paid amid financial problems at the Russian Football Union, who have simply been unable to afford his £7million per-year contract that he signed in January.

'I can say for a fact that the Russian Football Union simply does not have enough money to pay Capello's salary,' executive committee member Sergey Stepashin said in November.

Capello speaks to John Terry during a 2010 World Cup match between England and Algeria, when the 68-year-old was in charge of the Three Lions' ill-fated campaign for glory in South Africa

But Mutko claims the issue will be sorted in December and Capello will be paid in full for his work since June.

'By the end of the year, the situation should be resolved, the debt to Capello should be cleared,' Mutko told Russian media.

While Mutko played a key role in hiring Capello, he suggested there would be no government financial help and that 'the RFU should do it by itself,' even though the organization says it lacks the money.

Capello said last month he was running out of patience.
