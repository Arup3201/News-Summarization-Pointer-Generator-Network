An elderly widower choked on a celebratory Steak dinner in Lake Tahoe Thursday night just hours before having sex for the first time since his beloved wife died over a decade ago.

Johnny Orris, 86, was greatly looking forward to collect a prize he'd won on the Howard Stern show for the 'Get My Get my Grandpa Laid' contest in October: a menage a trois with two prostitutes at the famed Bunny Ranch in Nevada.

Orris and his grandson Ed, 49, were dining at the Sage Room Steakhouse at Harvey's Lake Tahoe when Orris began choking on his meal, said Bunny ranch owner Dennis Hof to the Daily News.

Ed and the maitre'd performed CPR. Orris was later taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Prostitutes Caressa Kisses and Vanity were heartbroken upon hearing the news that the gentleman they'd corresponded with almost every day since October choked just moments before they were able to give him the night of his life.

'I'm gonna be back here at 9-o'clock--you'd better be ready!,' Orris told the girls.

'He was on cloud nine, and anxious to get back to the Bunny Ranch,' said his grandson Ed.

Back in October, Orris told Howard Stern that his wife died 11 years ago and that he hadn't had sex since. He loved his wife dearly and never strayed. After her death he remained celibate but he dreamed of having sex with 'big breasted black women. '

The Friday following the contest, Ed and his grandfather spent the day flirting with the bunnies and Johnny was able to choose the two he wanted for his 'dream come true.' He chose the blonde and busty Caressa and a curvaceous brunette named Vanity.

Orris flew all the way from Sullivan, Illinois and wanted to have steak 'before the big game,' Hof told TMZ.

'Johnny said he was prepping for the "Super Bowl of Sex" and he never got there,' continued Hof.

Ed went to the ranch to tell them the sad news after his grandfather choked.

Hof and the bunnies let Ed use his grandpa's coupon for a free night of fun.

Ed told TMZ that he would have felt bad leaving the ranch without experiencing what it had to offer.

He also told TMZ he didn't have sex with Caressa or Vanity 'because that would have been weird.'

The Moonlight Bunny ranch is considered 'the finest adult entertainment facility' in Reno according to their website.

The ranch was featured in an HBO documentary called, 'Cathouse.' It is one of the few legal brothels in the United States.

Nevada is the only state to legalize any form of prostitution.
