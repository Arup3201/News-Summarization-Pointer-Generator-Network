Sajeel Shahid, 38, was allowed to establish a private primary school in Essex despite known links to extremists

An Islamic school set  up by a hardliner  who trained the ringleader of the 7/7 bombings is receiving money from the taxpayer, it emerged yesterday.

Sajeel Shahid, 38, was allowed to establish a private primary school in Essex despite known links to extremists.

Now the fee-paying school’s prospectus reveals that it claims nursery education grants which allow the parents of three- and four-year-olds to claim an annual discount of about £600 per child.

The Government passes the public money on to councils, which then hand it to schools that are registered with Ofsted.

Last night the Department for Education said it was ‘urgently’ investigating the latest claims at Ad-Deen Primary in Ilford. Officials said new powers were being introduced that would make it easier to bar unsuitable proprietors of independent schools.

Ofsted added that it was ready to launch a snap inspection if requested. Anger is growing over the case, with critics questioning how Shahid was able to found the primary in 2009 despite background vetting by the DfE.

Shahid, who has called for violence against British troops, was able to operate Ad-Deen for five years even though a special unit was also set up in 2010 to prevent individuals with extremist beliefs running schools.

Shahid was sent to Pakistan in 2001 to set up a branch of the Al Muhajiroun group, the Mail on Sunday reported.

In the same year, he gave a newspaper interview in which he said ‘jihad was the only solution for Muslim lands under occupation’.

He added: ‘We say the Pakistan army, navy and air force should be fighting US and British forces which are killing our Islamic brothers and sisters in Afghanistan.’

The camp trained Mohammed Siddique Khan, the leader of the London terror attacks of July 7 2005 in which 52 people died.

Others who attended the camp allegedly include convicted terrorists who plotted ten years ago to blow up the Bluewater Shopping Centre in Kent and London’s Ministry of Sound Nightclub.

In 2005, Shahid was held in Pakistan for three months over suspected links to Al Qaeda. After being expelled from the country, he returned to Britain, where he was raised.

He is said to be known to British security forces but has never been charged with any terrorism offences.

However, once back in the UK, Shahid was given permission to set up the primary. He was registered director and proprietor of Ad-Deen, which teaches 54 pupils aged three to 11, although he is said to have resigned from the school earlier this month.

Shahid is also thought to have helped teach children to recite the Koran and employed his brother, who also has links to extremism.

Ofsted found the school was giving pupils a limited appreciation and respect for other faiths and cultures in 2011 – just over a year after it opened. A year later the education watchdog said it was meeting ‘all regulatory requirements’.

MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said it is ‘extremely worrying’ that Shahid was in such a position.

A spokesman for the Department for Education said yesterday: ‘It is vital that we ensure unsuitable people are not managing independent schools.

'We are introducing new powers to ensure that people whose past conduct demonstrates they are not suitable to run an independent school can be barred.’

Ofsted said it could carry out an emergency inspection if asked by the Department for Education. A spokesman added: ‘Children must be safe at school.’
