Uruguay are increasingly confident Suarez will be fit to face England in the crunch World Cup clash on Thursday.

He trained fully with the team on Monday and worked in team formation in attack with Edinson Cavani in a major boost for their hopes of progressing into the knockout stages after the damaging defeat by Costa Rica.

Boss Oscar Tabarez was tight-lipped after Monday's training session, but admitted: 'It is a possibility. We can say nothing more.'

Suarez's presence would be a significant boost for Uruguay, who looked toothless in his absence.

The striker watched from the bench during the shock defeat on Saturday to Group D's least-fancied side, and looked close to tears as Uruguay fell victim to the World Cup's most surprising result so far.

The Liverpool forward warmed up during the second half, but, despite Tabarez's insistence that he would not have been on the bench unless he was fit, did not come on during in the defeat.

But Uruguay are confident the Premier League's top scorer will be available for the all-or-nothing clash with England.

Suarez, who it was also revealed on Monday is not in contact with his teammates in the England squad, scored 31 league goals last season as Liverpool narrowly missed out on the title, and is a talisman for his country.

But after injuring himself on the final day of the Premier League season, Suarez's World Cup would have beeen in danger of ending before it has started if he failed to get fully fit by Thursday.
