Oakland police have arrested the father of a missing 21-month-old girl on suspicion of endangering the girl's life by leaving her in a parked car with his mother, who suffers from dementia, while he ran to the store.

John Webb, 49, was jailed on $100,000 bond and was scheduled for arraignment Friday in connection with the disappearance of his 21-month-old daughter, Daphne Viola Webb, authorities said.

Webb told investigators he left his disabled mother and his daughter in his black Ford SUV while he dashed into Gazzali's Supermarket at 7838 International Boulevard in East Oakland for an energy drink at about 11am Wednesday, police spokeswoman Johnna Watson said.

Snatched: Witnesses reported seeing a woman carrying Daphne away from her father's black Ford SUV in Oakland

When Webb returned to his vehicle, he told police, the girl had vanished. Watson said at least one witness reported seeing an unidentified woman between the ages of 30 and 40 carrying Daphne away.

Webb was not considered a suspect in the abduction, Watson said. But she added that he was arrested because he left a 21-month-old girl in the care of her mentally disabled 87-year-old grandmother.

The father reported little Daphne missing at 11.09am. The California Highway Patrol issued an Amber Alert for the child and dispatched officers to scour East Oakland.

Police and FBI agents have spent the past three days searching for the toddler, who weighs about 30lbs and was last seen wearing an orange, two-piece pajama set with pink hearts, and pink socks, authorities said.

Authorities asked that anyone who had seen the father and daughter together in the days or hours before the incident contact investigators, and officers searched a shoreline park often frequented by Webb and the girl.

On Friday, police expanded the search for the toddler to the Oakland shoreline and the Oak Knoll neighborhood where the Webbs live, Oakland Tribune reported.

Authorities scoured the area by air using a police helicopter and by land with the help of motorcycles, which fanned out across local parks where the 49-year-old father would often take Daphne.

On Thursday afternoon, police cordoned off a parking lot at the Martin Luther King Jr. Regional Shoreline, not far from Oakland International Airport.

Four-legged help: Police had searched Webb's Oakland home with dogs and also used K-9 units to scour local parks

Sea search: Police used a boat equipped with sonar and an underwater camera to scour the Oakland shorline

Members of the Alameda County 
Sheriff's Search and Rescue team combed the area with at least two K-9 
dogs and a number of boats that scanned the water.

Dark past: Webb has a criminal record in Sacramento, which includes two arrests in 2001 and 2002 on charges of discharging a firearm with gross negligence and spousal battery

Police also employed sonar, but poor visibility in the murky water hampered their efforts.

The
search continued into Thursday evening with dozens of officers, 
including homicide detectives and FBI agents, search-and-rescue dogs, a 
helicopter and a boat with an underwater camera, Watson said.

A local NBC television affiliate reported that police had searched Webb's Oakland home with dogs.

Daphne’s mother, who is not being named, has been contacted about her daughter’s disappearance, but Watson said she is not considered a person of interest.

Webb has had several run-ins with the law while residing in Sacramento. Records show that he was arrested in 2001 on a felony charge of discharging a firearm with gross negligence charge.

In 2002, he was arrested on misdemeanor counts of spousal battery and criminal threats, but those charges were later dropped.

Police and Crime Stoppers of Oakland are offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information that would help them find the missing toddler.
