Israeli police  blocked more than 200 far-right Israeli protesters from rushing guests at a wedding of a Jewish woman and Muslim man as they shouted 'death to the Arabs'.

Several dozen police, including members of the force's most elite units, formed human chains to keep the protesters from the wedding hall's gates and chased after many who defied them.

Four protesters were arrested, and there were no injuries.

A lawyer for
 the couple, Maral Malka, 23, and Mahmoud Mansour, 26, both from the 
Jaffa section of Tel Aviv, had unsuccessfully sought a court order to 
bar the protest.

He obtained backing for police to keep protesters 200 yards from the wedding hall in the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon Lezion.

The
 protest highlighted a rise in tensions between Jewish and Arab citizens
 of Israel in the past two months amid a monthlong Gaza war, the kidnap 
and slaying of three Israeli teens in June followed by a revenge choking
 and torching to death of a Palestinian teen in the Jerusalem area.

A
 group called Lehava, which organised the wedding demonstration, has 
harassed Jewish-Arab couples in the past, often citing religious grounds
 for their objections to intermarriage. But they have rarely protested 
at the site of a wedding.

The groom told Israel's Channel 2 TV the protesters failed to derail the wedding or dampen its spirit. 'We will dance and be merry until the sun comes up. We favour coexistence,' he said.Â 

Protesters, many of them young men wearing black shirts, denounced Malka, who was born Jewish and converted to Islam before the wedding, as a 'traitor against the Jewish state,' and shouted epithets of hatred towards Arabs including 'death to the Arabs.'

They sang a song that urges, 'May your village burn down.'

A few dozen left-wing Israelis held a counter-protest nearby holding flowers, balloons and a sign that read: 'Love conquers all.'

Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, sworn in last month to succeed Shimon Peres, criticised the protest as a 'cause for outrage and concern' in a message on his Facebook page.

'Such expressions undermine the basis of our coexistence here, in Israel, a country that is both Jewish and democratic,' Rivlin, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud bloc, said.

Lehava spokesman and former lawmaker Michael Ben-Ari denounced Jews intermarrying with non-Jews of any denomination as 'worse than what Hitler did,' alluding to the murder of 6 million Jews across Europe in World War Two.

A surprise wedding guest was Israel's health minister, Yael German, a centrist in Netanyahu's government.

She told reporters as she headed inside that she saw the wedding and the protest against it as 'an expression of democracy.'

Arab citizens make up about 20 per cent of Israel's majority Jewish population, and the overwhelming majority of Arabs are Muslims. Rabbinical authorities who oversee most Jewish nuptials in Israel object to intermarriage fearing it will diminish the ranks of the Jewish people.

Many Israeli couples who marry out of their faith do so abroad.

Malka's father, Yoram Malka, said on Israeli television he objected to the wedding, calling it 'a very sad event.'

He
 said he was angry that his daughter had converted to Islam. Of his now 
son-in-law, he said, 'My problem with him is that he is an Arab.'

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday any deal on Gaza's future had to meet Israel's security needs, warning Hamas it faced 'harsh strikes' if it resumed firing into the Jewish state.

With a 
five-day ceasefire due to expire late on Monday, negotiators returned 
after consultations to Cairo to seek an end to five weeks of hostilities
 that have killed more than 2,000 people.

The United Nations said 425,000 people in the Gaza Strip have been displaced by the war.

The
 Palestinian Health Ministry in the enclave says 1,980 Palestinians, 
most of them civilians, have been killed in the conflict.

On the Israeli side, 64 soldiers and three civilians have been killed.
