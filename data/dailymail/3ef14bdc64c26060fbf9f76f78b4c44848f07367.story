An emotional Hannah Storm has spoken of how she was set on fire in a horrific barbeque grill accident at home in front of her daughters.

The ESPN anchor told of her ordeal to colleague and close friend Josh Elliot, breaking down in tears  as she relived the moment that she shouted to her daughters: 'Mommy is on fire, call 911.'

Storm hosted the Rose Parade in California with Elliot just three weeks after suffering first and second degree burns 
to her face, neck, hands and chest. She lost her eyebrows, eyelashes and
roughly half of her hair after the grill's propane tank exploded in her backyard.

Emotional: ESPN anchor Hannah Storm broke down as she told co-host Josh Elliot of the moment she was set on fire by a barbeque explosion

Close bond: Storm receives a hug from colleague Josh Elliot as the pair hosted the Rose Parade in California together for the fifth year running

The sports broadcaster spent an hour 
in hair and make-up ahead of fulfilling her commitment to co-host the 
January 1 Rose Parade in Pasadena for the fifth year running, 
a bandage on her left hand the only visible sign of the ordeal.

She 
bravely shared shocking pictures of the true extent of her 
injuries.

Storm said that she had been 
preparing dinner for her daughters on the outdoor grill but the flames blew out 
because it was a windy night. When she went to reignite the grill, there
was an explosion.

She said: 'There
was an explosion which blew the doors of the grill off. A wall of fire 
came at me, it was like a movie. I looked down and I saw that I was on 
fire.'

Shock: The ESPN anchor, with her left hand bandaged, explained how her hair caught fire after a propane explosion at her Connecticut home

Ordeal: Storm looked visibly upset as she told of how she tried to douse the flames shooting up her body and shouted to her daughters to dial 911

Colleagues: Elliot, who has worked with the sports caster for many years, embraced Storm after the interview

She said that her daughter, also called Hannah, saved the day by remaining calm and calling emergency services.

She spoke of how much she had relied on her three daughters while recovering, adding tearfully that 'my middle daughter would wash my hair'.

She also thanked her friends for their support before getting a tight hug from Elliot who appeared visibly upset by his long-time colleague's story.

Injuries: Sports anchor Hannah Storm revealed the burns to her face following the barbecue grill accident at her home in Connecticut

Painful: Ms Storm suffered first and second degree burns to her face, hands, chest and neck in the accident on December 11

All smiles: Storm and Elliot have co-hosted the Rose Parade for the past four years

Storm had earlier told the The New 
York Post how she ripped off her burning shirt with her left hand and 
tried to use another part of the shirt to extinguish the flames which 
had begun burning on her head and chest.

Taken to the Trauma and Burn Center at Westchester Medical Center, Ms Storm spent more than a day being treated for her wounds.

'I
didn't see my face until the next day and you wonder how it's going to 
look,' she said to the New York Post.  'I was pretty shocked. But my 
overarching thought was I've covered events with military members who 
have been through a lot worse than me, and they've come through. I kept 
thinking, ''I can do this. I'm fortunate.'''

Previewing her return: Co-host Josh Elliott tweeted pictures of Storm before the Tuesday show

Happy: The pair posed in front of the sign showing the parade's Dr. Suess-inspired theme

The ESPN host has hardly left her home since the accident and has told her fans to expect to see some slight facial changes when she returned - including some obvious differences in her hair.

Physical differences were not the only changes seen on the Tuesday broadcast. Ms Storm is left-handed, and taking notes is almost
impossible. Dressing and showering are challenges, too.

'I'm a little nervous about things I 
used to take for granted,' she said by phone this weekend from Pasadena,
California. 'Little things like putting on makeup and even turning 
pages on my script.'

The popular host has told viewers of the 2013 Rose Parade to expect to see a slight difference in her appearance tomorrow

Ms Storm
said that long before her accident, she'd been inspired by Iraq War 
veteran, actor and "Dancing With the Stars" winner J.R. Martinez, the 
grand marshal at last year's parade. He was severely burned in a land 
mine accident while serving overseas.

One attraction of this 
year's parade that she was eager to see—the Nurses' Float, and she hoped
to use that moment on air to thank everyone who had taken care of her.

Ms Storm wants to anchor SportsCenter in Bristol, Connecticut, next 
Sunday.

After that, the Notre Dame alum is ready to go in person to 
watch the No. 1 Irish play Alabama in the national championship game at 
Miami. She said the school reached out after hearing about her injuries 
and had been very supportive.

'More than anything, I feel 
gratitude,' she said.

'Something like this really makes you appreciate 
everything you have, even the chance to wake up on New Year's Day and do
your job.'
