Jennifer Lopez recently made headlines for serenading the oppressive ruler of Turkmenistan and now a human rights group says it’s not the first time she’s shaken her famous derriere for the world’s most notorious thugs.

Human Rights Foundation criticized Lopez’s June 29 rendition of ‘Happy Birthday’ for President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov and now the group claims she’s taken money to perform for at least three other leaders and businessmen of ill repute.

While Jenny from the Block was paid a reported $1.5 million for the Turkmenistan gig that was hosted by China National Petroleum, Human Rights Foundation says she’s made a total of $10 million from that and other questionable bookings.

Ta da! Jennifer Lopez gives birthday performance for Turkmenistan president Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov June 29. Lopez is under fire for taking over $1M from the notoriously repressive leader

‘J.Lo has repeatedly mingled with and entertained some of the world’s worst thugs and their cronies,’ Human Rights Foundation president Thor Halvorssen said in a statement.

Berdimuhamedow has been criticized for oppressive rule by human rights organizations. Human Rights Watch describes Turkmenistan as ‘among the most repressive in the world.’

According to Human Rights Foundation, other leaders and businessmen with a history of human rights violations for whom Lopez has performed include Telman Ismailov, a Russian oligarch widely accused of corruption, and a 2011 performance for Uzbek industrialist Azam Aslanov at the wedding of his son.

Lopez was booked to sing happy birthday to another man, an allegedly corrupt Russian bureaucrat named Alexander Yolkin. She was paid $2 million for the gig, but it never happened because Yolkin was arrested the day before Lopez was slated to perform.

Easy money? A still from a Youtube shows Jennifer Lopez during her 2011 performance at the lavish wedding of the son of corrupt Uzbek industrialist Azam Aslanov. She was reportedly paid $1 million for the gig

Notorious: President Berdymukhamedov's country has been called 'among the most repressive in the world' by human rights groups but he's not the first corrupt leader J.Lo has performed for 

The dictatorship of Azerbaijan, reports Human Rights Foundation, paid Lopez $2.5 million in 2012 to perform for a FIFA soccer tournament. The event was rescheduled for 2014, however Lopez and her representation reportedly met with the wife of the country’s dictator to negotiate a partnership in a proposed Azerbaijan music festival.

Human Rights Foundation also criticized Lopez for taking a leg of her 2012 tour to Belarus, a country the group calls ‘Europe’s only dictatorship.’

Lopez's publicist responded to the row over the Turkmenistan event, and said the gig was vetted by the performer’s staff: ‘Had there been knowledge of human rights issues any kind, Jennifer would not have attended.’

However, her representation has yet to 
comment on Human Rights Foundation’s latest accusations and MailOnline 
could not reach publicist Mark Young for further comment as of Sunday 
evening.

Other instanes: In 2006, Lopez performed for Russian mogul Telman Ismailov, an ostentatious man often accused of corruption and known to be despised by the Russian government

Though Lopez appears to be more active in her overseas performances for the world’s wealthy, she is not the only celebrity to face criticism for showing up to photo-ops with dubious leaders.

In 2011, Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank profusely apologized after attending a birthday party for Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who had been accused of torture and killings; she said she didn't have a full understanding of the event.

Swank fired several members of her publicity team shortly after the incident.

Interesting, Kadyrov was also in attendance at the 2011 Uzbekistan event where Lopez sang.

Meanwhile, Lopez has yet to off a public apology for performing for the Turkmeni autocrat, or for her participation in any of the past events reported by Human Rights Foundation.

Lucrative: Watch group Human Rights Foundation accuses Lopez of performing for at least four leaders with histories of human rights violations, for which she raked in $10 million
