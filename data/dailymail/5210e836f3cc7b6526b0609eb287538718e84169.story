Labour is preparing to humiliate the Liberal Democrats by backing a Conservative plan for criminals caught carrying a knife for the second time to face an automatic jail sentence.

Nick Clegg was said to be 'bouncing off the walls' last week after secret Cabinet correspondence was leaked to the Daily Mail revealing senior Lib Dems are resisting Tory proposals to toughen punishments for repeat offences.

Now Labour sources suggest the party is planning to exploit what has become one of the worst coalition splits since David Cameron vetoed an EU treaty in 2011 without consulting the Lib Dems.

Ed Miliband is said to ready to back a change in the law in a vote on knife crime to be forced by the Tories in the Commons as soon next week. That would almost certainly result in the move being approved by MPs, regardless of the stance of the Lib Dems.

'We are prepared to back the amendment,' a senior Labour source said.

A decision is understood to have been taken by the Labour leader's office to support tougher sentencing for knife offenders late on Friday and a vote in the Commons is expected as soon as May 12.

Last week, the Mail published a leaked letter to Mr Clegg from Lib Dem Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander rejecting plans to impose a mandatory six-month jail sentence on any adult convicted of a second knife offence as too expensive.

Marked 'restricted', it was sent the day after the tragic stabbing of teacher Ann Maguire. In an earlier letter to the Deputy Prime Minister, Lib Dem schools minister David Laws said mandatory minimum sentences were 'too blunt an instrument' and said he was unwilling to support them.

The Deputy Prime Minister is understood to have blamed the Tories for the highly unusual breach of Cabinet confidentiality.

A senior Lib Dem source said the Tories should 'examine their own consciences' over the leak, accusing them of engaging in political games in the aftermath of Mrs Maguire's killing. Tory sources said the proposal to tighten the law had been under discussion for months in advance.

Conservative Cabinet ministers including Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, Theresa May, the Home Secretary, and Michael Gove, the Education Secretary and Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretary, have all lined up behind the plan for tougher knife laws. Kenneth Clarke, the veteran Cabinet minister, is understood to be the only senior Tory backing the Lib Dems, arguing judges' hands should not be tied.

Mr Grayling wants to use a forthcoming crime Bill to introduce automatic jail sentences for offenders caught carrying knives for a second time.

Nick de Bois, the Conservative MP for Enfield North, has tabled am amendment to the Bill introduce automatic jail terms, which has already been supported by 30 Tory MPs. Backing from Labour would guarantee it would be passed by the Commons.

Mr de Bois said only one in four of the 16,031 cases of knife possession last year resulted in immediate custody.

'Over 2,500 of those caught in possession of a knife last year were aged 10 to 17,' he added.

'If we need any more convincing about the weak message being sent out about carrying a knife, then we need to look no further if thousands of children don' t regard it as serious.

'I hope backbenchers from across the House will support this amendment and it can become law.

'The support across the country and amongst backbench MPs should give the Deputy Prime Minister pause to reflect on his decision. It should also give the Prime Minister the confidence that he would be in tune with both his party and the country to support this measure.'
