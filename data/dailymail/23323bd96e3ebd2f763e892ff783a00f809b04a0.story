Theory: Mathematics professor Jordan Ellenberg says it is better to arrive later at an airport and risk missing a flight, rather than wait for hours for a plane

It is a question that can leave many holidaymakers baffled.

Is it better to arrive at the airport early and while away hours in Duty Free, or set off late and risk missing the flight?

Now a mathematician says he has hit upon the formula for the optimal time to arrive at the airport that minimises wasted time at the airport, yet also ensures passengers will only have a one or two percent chance of missing their plane.

According to American mathematics 
professor Jordan Ellenberg, every hour a passenger spends at the airport
 rather than in the comfort of their own home is a negative unit.

In
 his new book How Not To Be Wrong - The Hidden Maths Of Everyday Life, 
Prof Ellenberg instead recommends that holidaymakers and business 
travellers leave it later to catch their flights, even if that means 
potentially missing the plane, so as not to amass too many wasted hours 
over the course of a lifetime.

Former child prodigy Prof Ellenberg, who teaches mathematics at University of Wisconsin, says the optimal time to arrive 'depends on how you personally feel about the relative merits of missing planes and wasting time,' according to the Sunday Times.

'But if in the course of a lifetime you never miss a flight then you may not have the best strategy.'

In the book, released on Tuesday, Prof 
Ellenberg sets out to show how mathematics can impact on, and explain, a
 host of every day occurrences.

Whiling away the hours: Prof Ellenberg says every hour spent waiting in the lounge or wandering through Duty Free is a negative unit

Prof Ellenberg argues that 'if you've never missed a flight, you're not doing it right'.

He says that although passengers who arrive at the airport three hours before their flight will never miss it, they will spend numerous 'negative units' of time waiting in a lounge, or wandering through Duty Free.

The professor says the optimal time to arrive gives passengers a one or two percent chance of missing the plane, but reduces this wasted time.

How long passengers are prepared to leave it is up to them, says Prof Ellenberg

He tackles a number of dilemmas and issues including why tall parents have shorter children, what is the best way to get rich by playing the lottery and why women might struggle to find their perfect man.

Prof Ellenberg also weighs in to a debate on how governments will never be able to completely cut out money wasted, as doing so will result in politicians spending too much time fighting against waste.

'You can't do calculus by common sense,' he writes.

'But calculus is still derived from common sense - Newton took our physical intuition about objects moving in straight lines, formalised it, and then built on top of that formal structure a universal mathematical description of motion.

'Once you have Newton's theory in hand, you can apply it to problems that would make your head spin if you had no equations to help you.'
