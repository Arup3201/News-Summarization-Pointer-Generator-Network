Murder suspect Shrien Dewani appeared in a South African court today ahead of his long-awaited trial for allegedly killing his wife on their honeymoon.

Dewani, a 35-year-old from Bristol, was travelling in a taxi with his wife Anni, 28, through a poor township in South Africa in 2010 when their vehicle was hijacked.

He was soon released unharmed, but his wife was found dead the next day with a gunshot to her neck.

Trial: Dewani will appear in court on October 6 for his full trial over the murder, which took place in 2010

Dewani, a millionaire businessman, faces a full trial in Cape Town starting on October 6. He is accused of hiring hitmen to stage the abduction.

He denies any involvement in the killing.

Three men have already been convicted of hijacking, murder and robbery charges in connection with Anni’s death and are serving prison sentences.

All gave accounts implicating Dewani, who faces at least 25 years in prison if found guilty. 

At the court appearance today, Dewani was seen arriving in a car. His defence lawyer, Francois van Zyl, was also at court, as were members of the accused's family.

After his wife's death, Dewani returned to Britain, but was extradited to South Africa to face trial over the murder.

While he was fighting the extradition request, fears were raised over Dewani's mental health, with medical experts reported that he has nightmares and flashbacks.

Mounting the steps: South African state prosecutor Adrian Mopp (left) is seen here entering the court. The state's case, based on testimony from men in prison for Anni Dewani's murder, is that Dewani paid the hitmen

He refused to attend a psychiatric facility in Britain and was instead being managed at home where he was treated for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. 

When he appeared in a South African court in April this year, the judge ordered that his mental state be assessed, and observers deemed that he is fit to stand trial.

Between appearances, Dewani has been held at the Valkenberg psychiatric hospital, where he has been pictured on a daily walking and seemingly smiling with guards and members of staff.

Support: Dewani's parents, Prakash, left, and Snila, right, were at the court today to support their son
