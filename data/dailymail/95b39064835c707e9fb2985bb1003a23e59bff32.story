Stunning fireworks displays enchanted onlookers around the country last night, as dramatic displays lit up the sky in cities around America for Fourth of July celebrations.

For one man, though, the view from below wasn't enough, and he decided to use his GoPro-equipped drone to film the action from the sky.

South African Jos Stiglingh flew his DJI Phantom 2 drone into the midst of a West Palm Beach, Florida fireworks display, and the resulting footage is stunning - but also illegal.

Breathtaking: The drone had a GoPro camera attached which captured footage of fireworks exploding from the sky

Set to a dramatic Andrea Bocelli aria, the footage shows fireworks exploding sometimes right next to the drone.

However, the video has been condemned by critics, who point out that flying a drone into fireworks is not only unsafe, it's illegal.

During fireworks displays, authorities establish no-fly safety zones to protect the public.

In Florida for July 4, the Coast Guard enacted a temporary rule:

'The Coast Guard is establishing three temporary safety zones during Fourth of July firework events... Non-participant persons and vessels are prohibited from entering, transiting through, anchoring in, or remaining within any of the safety zones unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Miami or a designated representative.'

Unsafe: Many viewers pointed out that while beautiful, the footage is illegal

Rules: As drones become more common, the FAA is examining its UAV regulations

According to Forbes, the punishment for violating a safety zone is a $40,000 fine and for willful violations it is a Class D felony, punishable by at least five, but no more than 10 years in prison.

Toy drones, which look like miniature helicopters, are becoming more and more common, with operators flying them over concerts and beaches, and the Federal Aviation Authority is in the middle of examining its current Unmanned Aerial Vehicle regulations.

'It should be obvious that flying a drone through a fireworks display is unsafe and illegal,' wrote law and public policy expert Gregory S. McNeal in Forbes.

'Unfortunately stories like these demonstrate that what is clearly unsafe to most people, is somehow lost on a few careless operators.'
