A video has emerged appearing to show Argentinean supporters attacking and robbing a Brazilian fan prior to their World Cup match with Nigeria in Porto Alegre on Wednesday night.

The clip, recorded by Brazilian television company RBS, shows half a dozen fans in Argentine club shirts knocking a man wearing a black jacket with 'Brazil' on the reverse to the ground.

He is then kicked by several of them while others reach inside his jacket to try and steal possessions. One walks away casually with his rucksack after dragging it off his back.

Attacked: The man is seemingly surrounded by Argentine fans, pushed to the ground and kicked repeatedly. Others try to steal possessions from his jacket, while one makes off with his rucksack

Surrounded: The man was attacked by about half a dozen people in Argentine club shirts, before others intervened to stop the incident

Dazed: When the man gets back to his feet, it becomes clear why he was targeted - the jacket had 'Brazil' written on the back

Two of the clearly identifiable club shirts are Boca Juniors and River Plate, the Argentine league's biggest clubs.

Thousands of Argentine fans descended on Porto Alegre as they completed their group stage campaign with a 3-2 win over Nigeria.

Lionel Messi scored twice - including a lovely long-range free-kick - before Marcos Rojo scored what proved to be the winner five minutes into the second half.Â 

Large numbers: Argentina fans travelled in their thousands to the Beira-Rio Stadium in Porto Alegre to watch their team's final group match against Nigeria
