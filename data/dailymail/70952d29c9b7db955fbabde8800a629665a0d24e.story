The former Rutgers University student convicted of using a webcam to spy on his gay roommate arrived at the sheriff’s office this afternoon to begin his 30-day sentence.

Dharun Ravi, 21, was driven by a family friend in their Toyota Sienna and arrived at the sheriff's department in New Brunswick, New Jersey, just after 12:30pm to be fingerprinted and photographed.

The student was wearing a navy blue T-shirt, khakis, and canvas sneakers, and also had a pair of plastic-rimmed glasses to go with newly-cropped hair. His father and two attorneys hugged him before leaving the sheriff's department.

The Star-Ledger reported that Ravi got quite a media reception – at least 15 cameramen and photographers greeted him outside of the Middlesex County Sheriff’s Office.

Shortly after he entered, Ravi’s father, Ravi Pazhani, and his defence attorney Philip Nettl left the office.

Sheriff Mildred Scott told the Star-Ledger: ‘(Ravi) got to say goodbye to his family,’ adding that he would go through the booking process and would be taken to the Middlesex County Corrections Centre.

Ravi was then driven to the county jail to serve a 30-day term, though he will likely be out in 20 because of time off for good behaviour. The 21-year-old is also appealing the sentence, meaning it could be thrown out all together.

Ravi's roommate, Tyler Clementi, committed suicide in September 2010, days after Ravi used a webcam to see him kissing another man.

'I learned a lot about bias crimes and bullying through this case,' said a writer named Louise. 'The bullying and bias acts occurred when the legal system and media got involved.

Last
Monday, I was sentenced to 3 years probation, 300 hours of community 
service, a fine of more than $10,000.00, and 30 days in jail.

Since
the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office appealed that sentence, the 
sentence does not have to start until the appeal is decided.

Nevertheless,
I decided to accept and hopefully complete the sentence as soon as 
possible. It’s the only way I can go on with my life.

I
accept responsibility for and regret my thoughtless, insensitive, 
immature, stupid and childish choices that I made on September 19, 2010 
and September 21, 2010.

My
behavior and actions, which at no time were motivated by hate, bigotry,
prejudice or desire to hurt, humiliate or embarrass anyone, were 
nonetheless the wrong choices and decisions. I apologize to everyone 
affected by those choices.

I
am surrendering myself to the Middlesex County Correctional Facility on
Thursday, May 31, 2012, to start my 30-day period of imprisonment.

'Ravi is not to blame for the hardships endured by the gay community nor should he be tied to the whipping post because of it. If Tyler was not gay, this would have been just a prank gone wrong and no one would have rushed to incarcerate.'

Soon after that, the letters began pouring into Superior Court Judge Glenn Berman's chambers making requests for how to handle sentencing. Ravi faced up to 10 years in prison.

Last week, Judge Berman told him he would have to serve 30 days in jail. Because the sentence is less than a year, it decreases the chances that federal immigration authorities will seek to have Ravi deported to India, where he was born and remains a citizen.

Prosecutors said they would appeal the sentence as too light. Ravi, who maintains he is innocent, is considering appealing the entire conviction.

Before delivering the sentence, Berman held up a folder, inches thick, of the letters he'd received from the public. Later, he quoted one of them, calling Clementi's suicide the 'pink elephant' in the case.

Berman made the letters publicly available, but only after having court staff cross out the last names, addresses of and other identifying information about their authors. He said the writers may have expected their communications with him would be private.

It's a case that's been dissected by pundits and advocates, addressed by President Barack Obama, debated on by hundreds of bloggers, tweeters and online newspaper commenters and discussed at countless dinner tables. The people who decided to address Berman directly represent just one sliver of the public comment on the tragedy — but a particularly passionate one.

Tragic end: Rutgers student Tyler Clementi jumped off the George Washington Bridge in 2010 after webcam footage showing he and another man kissing circulated the internet

Residence hall: Clementi and Ravi shared Room 30 of Davidson Hal, Rutgers University

The case began in September 2010 when Ravi's randomly assigned freshman-year roommate asked Ravi to stay away so he and a guest could have privacy.

Ravi went to a friend's room and turned on his webcam remotely. Jurors at his trial earlier this year heard that he and the friend saw just seconds of Clementi kissing the guest, who was identified in court only by the initials M.B.

When Tyler, an 18-year-old violinist from Ridgewood, asked for privacy again two days later, Ravi agreed - then told friends how they could access his webcam.

But this time, the webcam was not on when M.B. came over. There was testimony both that Clementi unplugged it and that Ravi himself put it to sleep.

The next night, Tyler jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge. Jurors learned that he checked Ravi's Twitter feed repeatedly before his suicide.

Clementi is seen as an example of what can happen to young gays who are too often bullied even as acceptance of gays has increased.

After the suicide, gay-rights and anti-bullying activists held him up as an example of the horrible consequences of bullying young gays. Even President Barack Obama spoke about the tragedy.

September 21, 2010: Clementi  posts on a gay discussion forum: ‘I feel like the only thing the schoolmight do is find me another roommate, probably with me moving out…and I’d probably just end up with somebody worse than him.’ He requests a room change. M.B. comes over later that evening.

Meanwhile, Ravi told a former high school friend to connect to his computer through iChat saying: ‘People are having a viewing party.’
