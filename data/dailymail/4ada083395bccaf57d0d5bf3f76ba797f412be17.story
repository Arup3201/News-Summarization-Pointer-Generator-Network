Jailed: Majid Bashir was jailed for four years and nine months after hitting father-of-four Stephen Chappell while driving his wife's car without a licence or insurance

A hit-and-run killer who callously drove off after fatally injuring a father-of-four was caught after trying to claim for the damage on his wife's car insurance.

Majid Bashir did not have a licence when, driving his wife's Nissan Micra, he hit Stephen Chappell crossing a busy road last January.

He carried on driving for one-and-a-half miles with a shattered windscreen, before abandoning the vehicle near Great Barr, West Midlands.

Mr Chappell, an HGV driver, suffered severe head injuries and died days later.

But soon after, Bashir, 39, contacted his wife's insurance company to make a claim for the damage.

Yesterday, Bashir was found guilty of causing death while uninsured, aggravated vehicle-taking and dangerous driving.

He was jailed for four years and nine months at Birmingham Crown Court, and banned from the roads for four-and-half-years.

Judge Patrick Thomas QC said it was a 'deeply sad case' as Mr Chappell was a 'hugely decent man in the middle of his life with a loving family.'

His grieving family later slammed the sentence and claimed they had faced threats and intimidation during the court case.

The court heard the victim had parked his lorry on Bordesley Green Road on January 30, 2013 and had later been trying to return to his vehicle.

He waited for another lorry and car to pass before getting half way across the road when he was struck by a Nissan Micra driven by Bashir, who had no driving licence or insurance.

The judge said Bashir had been travelling
 at just above the speed limit and that his view had been partly 
obscured both by the passing lorry and Mr Chappellâ€™s own HGV.

The judge told Birmingham Crown Court said it was a 'deeply sad case' as Mr Chappell was a 'hugely decent man in the middle of his life with a loving family'

As a result he should have taken extra care while making the over-taking manoeuvre, as he only had a couple of seconds in which to avoid the collision.

Judge Thomas said: 'You drove off leaving him to his fate in a vehicle which had sustained very significant damage to its front, in particular the windscreen.'

Sanjeev Sharma, defending, said Bashir, a father-of-four, was remorseful and continued: 'He wishes that he could have made a different choice on that day.'

But after the hearing Donna Humphries, one of Mr Chappellâ€™s daughters said: 'We are pleased with the sentence although it is nowhere near what it should be.

'Every court hearing we have had to come to we have had some kind of intimidation or threats from his family and friends. There is no respect there, no moral fibre.'
