A pensioner who strangled his wife of 50 years because he could not cope with her deterioration due to Alzheimer's has walked free from court today.

Former pub landlord Keith Rumbold snapped while caring for Shirley Rumbold at their North Wales bungalow and then tried to take his own life with a cocktail of whisky, ant powder and tablets.

Rumbold, 74, could not bear the thought of his wife being put in a psychiatric ward where he feared she would be cruelly treated.

One morning when she became agitated and refused to dress, he flipped and grabbed her around the neck for what he thought was a few seconds.

As she passed away, she slipped off the bed on to the floor and he placed a pillow under her head and kissed her repeatedly, telling her that he was sorry.

Mrs Rumbold's death was the second tragedy to hit the family this summer after the couple's grandson died after falling into a pond in the back garden of his home.

Rumbold's suicide attempt failed and he was charged with murdering 73-year-old Shirley.

A trial was due to be held next year, but today at Mold Crown Court in Wales his guilty plea to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility was accepted by the prosecution.

Rumbold, who had never been in any trouble before, received a 51-week prison sentence suspended for two years.

Snapped: Police outside the bungalow in Prestatyn, North Wales, where Rumbold strangled his wife while caring for her because he didn't want her going to a psychiatric hospital

He was placed on supervision and a 
mental health treatment order was made so that he would receive 
treatment from a psychiatrist as an out-patient.

Mr
Justice Lloyd-Jones told him that he had already served the equivalent 
of a 12-month sentence since the killing on June 9 and it was not 
necessary for him to return to prison.

Rumbold had previously spoken of suicide, saying it had been a cry for help as he tried to cope with 'her cruel illness', effectively as her sole carer.

He did not want her placed in an unit where she would have to wear a nappy and felt that she would only last a couple of weeks.

                 Mr Justice Lloyd-Jones

The judge said that he decided to kill himself 'because you could not bear to be without her' and tried to stab himself. But he did not penetrate the skin.

The judge said: 'There is a great deal of mitigation. Your relationship was a very loving one. During her illness, you gave her four years of selfless devotion and love. You snapped and lost self control under the immense pressure.'

The defendant, the judge said, was trapped between the pressure of being unable to look after her at home and his dread of her going into a home. 

The couple were married 50 years and were said to be devoted to each other.

The couple had three grown up children, and lived in a one-bedroom bungalow at The Meadows in Prestatyn where their daughter found her dead and him lying on the dining room floor in June.

Prosecutor John Philpotts said Mrs Rumbold suffered from vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. She was on medication, but he refused to administer it, saying that he did not want her to be 'like a zombie'.

Second tragedy: The couple's 11-year-old grandson, Nathan Rumbold, was found dead after falling into a pond at his home in Polesworth, Warwickshire, last summer

At times, he appeared 'at the end of his tether'.

In the days and weeks leading up to her death, her condition continued to worsen, the court heard.

She was verbally and sometimes physically aggressive to him and his own health began to suffer. He was reluctant to accept help from outside agencies and appeared to be embarrassed by the situation. 

Rumbold seemed very concerned that social services were intervening and hostile to the idea of her moving into residential care.

'He had seen a television programme a few days earlier on June 1 which suggested that standards within some care homes were poor and he appeared convinced that his wife would be treated badly if she were admitted into care,' said Mr Philpotts. 

On the day of the killing, their daughter Susan Davies attended their home, the curtains were drawn and she found a number of notes from her father, warning her to take care on entering the bedroom.

One asked if he and his wife could be cremated together. He was lying in the doorway of the dining room and on entering the bedroom she found her mother dead on the floor with pillows placed either side of her.

Mrs Davies realised from her mother's facial expression that she was dead. She shouted: 'What have you done?' and her father appeared to try to respond.

Mr Philpotts said: 'Paramedics attended. He told them that he wanted to die, that they were not to resuscitate him and that he had taken tablets and anything he could get his hands on.'

He said she had 'taken a funny turn' and 'was now at peace'. He said he wanted to die and to be with his wife.

The defendant had four or five very superficial scratches to the abdomen which he said he had caused with a knife and he said he had taken whisky and ant powder.

He told police: 'She had dementia. The last three years have been hell. What is going to happen to me now? I did it. I strangled her. '

Arrested on suspicion of murder he said: 'What happened today was I just put Shirley to sleep'. I've always been a law-abiding citizen.'

He added: 'All I wanted was social services to come round and give us a hand with the cleaning.'

When interviewed by the police, he said: 'I was getting her clothes out of the wardrobe, then I just snapped. I just didn't know what day it was or what time it was and I just snapped and I grabbed her by the neck.

'Everything just seemed to come up in a like a surge you know and I just cracked. I turned around and just grabbed her by the throat I think...I don't remember after that.'

Mrs Rumbold died from asphyxiation caused by external compression of the neck, probably by manual strangulation. Gordon Cole QC, mitigating, said the case was 'tragic'.

The defendant was a law-abiding, hard working man who was devoted to his wife and she was devoted to him, he said.

Earlier this year, the couple's grandson Nathan Rumbold died after apparently tripping and banging his head before falling into a pond in back garden in Polesworth, Warwickshire.

He was taken to hospital by air ambulance, but was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.

The boy's family were said to be 'absolutely distraught and deep in grief'.

The tragedy happened at a cul-de-sac at Polesworth, Warwickshire.

After Rumbold's sentencing, Detective Sergeant Helen Douglas, of North Wales Police, said the sentence concluded a very difficult and sensitive case.

She said: 'Our condolences go to Shirley Rumbold's family who have conducted themselves with dignity throughout this deeply distressing time.

'The family wish to say that Shirley Rumbold was a very loving and caring mother who was adored by all her grandchildren.

'They wish to thank all who have supported them throughout these difficult months and would appreciate from privacy following today's hearing.'
