She might be a member of one of Europe's leading royal dynasties but Queen Letizia of Spain is happy to forgo most of the trappings.

The 42-year-old arrived for a cancer charity event this morning on foot, having been dropped off in a nearby car park alone and without security guards.

Despite the lack of frills, she was every inch the style queen in her Tyrian purple coat and fashionable aviator sunglasses.

Low key: Queen Letizia arrives for a meeting held by the Spanish Association Against Cancer in Madrid

Carrying a black briefcase, the royal looked businesslike as she made her way into the meeting held by the Spanish Association Against Cancer, a charity of which she is patron.

Her low key approach is yet another sign of the increasingly Scandinavian style of the Spanish monarchy, which has so far seen Felipe prioritise being seen as 'normal' over the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by his father King Juan-Carlos.

His latest move came last Thursday, when he banned senior royals, including himself, his two daughters and Letizia, from accepting expensive gifts.

The new rules, which also apply to Juan-Carlos and his wife Queen Sofia, come into effect on New Year's Day and are intended to avoid 'compromising the dignity of the institution'.

Felipe's move comes after his father's reign was blighted by accusations of extravagance - not helped by his habit of accepting gifts that included an €18m (£14m) yacht.

Fortuna, which Juan-Carlos was forced to stop using last year in a nod to austerity, became a regular plaything of the Spanish royals, who used it during summer holidays in Mallorca.

Felipe's new-look Spanish monarchy is closer in style to the Scandinavian system, which sees members of the royal family live relatively low key lifestyles.

As part of his drive to modernise the institution, the 46-year-old royal also banned members of his family from working in the private sector and insisted that all must behave in an 'exemplary manner' likely to 'earn citizens' appreciation, respect and trust.'

Despite boasting fewer staff and less money than their British and Spanish counterparts, the Norwegian, Danish and Swedish monarchs and their families do accept gifts, although like the British royals, most have to be declared.

In the case of the UK royal family, gifts either become part of the Royal Collection and are displayed during the summer exhibition season or are donated to the relevant museum or institution.

Although the Queen is yet to benefit from a free flight or a yacht like Juan-Carlos, she has received a number of unusual gifts on state visits, including a collection of shells, a set of lacrosse sticks, sunglasses, a pair of sandals, pineapples, eggs, a box of snail shells, a grove of maple trees, a dozen tins of of tuna and 7kg of prawns.

The Queen has also been given a number of horses, among them her favourite mount, Burmese, and a series of exotic animals, including a canary, jaguars, sloths and an elephant called Jumbo, all of which were given to London Zoo.
