A Romanian man was filmed laughing and dancing after he was arrested by officers in London, who were waiting for a car to take him to the police station.

The video has caused heated debate in Romania where the country is trying to insist that Romanians who come to the UK will behave themselves and not simply going there to steal.

But the young man in the video who was not named by Romanian media was said to have been stopped this week in London and was being held in handcuffs after being caught stealing.

The Romanian man was seen pelvic thrusting to the music in the video as officers waited for transport

Standing in front of his friends they put loud Romanian Manela music on their car stereo prompting the young man to make several jokes in Romanian and start to dance some steps to the popular tunes.

The others are heard laughing and joking off-camera with the young man making several pelvic thrusts indicating that he is not in the least bit worried.

At one point he rests his shoulder on the police officer as if he's sleeping even though he clearly isn't drunk or inebriated in any way. For him the whole situation appears to be a joke.

User comments posted in Romania ask whether the man's parents are proud of his actions that have shamed the country.

The video ends when the man is taken by police to a car and driven away to the police station.

In October it was reported that policemen from Romania and Poland are being drafted in to help British forces combat an Eastern European crimewave.

Scotland
 Yard has recruited the officers, who have flown to the capital for a 
two-year â€˜tour of dutyâ€™ to help identify and deport overseas offenders.

The move comes ahead of the lifting of border controls on immigrants from Romania in two monthsâ€™ time.
