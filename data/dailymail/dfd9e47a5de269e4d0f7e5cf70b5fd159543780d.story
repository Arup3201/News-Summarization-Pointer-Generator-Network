Wojciech Szczesny  sacrificed his Arsenal career on football game FIFA so he could bring Zlatan Ibrahimovic to the Emirates.

The 24-year-old revealed on Polish television that he sold himself to Manchester United in a deal worth £18.5million before bringing Sweden star Ibrahimovic to Arsenal.

Conducting an interview at his home Arsenal No 1 Szczesny was questioned after a message showed up on the game that read 'fans pleased for Ospina'.

Szczesny also revealed that he had signed Zlatan Ibrahimovic for Arsenal with the funds made from the sale

The Arsenal keeper, pictured training last week, has been on international duty with Poland 

'In other words, I just sold Szczesny,' the Poland international said. '(I sold him to) Manchester United, following in Tomasz Kuszczak's footsteps.'

'They offered me £18.5m. I thought "I'm going to buy a solid defensive midfielder with that."'

But Szczesny then reveals he didn't invest the funds raised by his own sale to strengthen the solidity of the Arsenal midfield.

'Look, Arsenal's new hero. Look who I bought,' he added. 'Ibrahimovic! I guess it was worth replacing Szczesny with Ibrahimovic.'
