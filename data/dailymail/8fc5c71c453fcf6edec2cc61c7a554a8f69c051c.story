With a cry of 'O zapft is' Munich's mayor Dieter Reiter tapped the first keg of 2014's Oktoberfest festivities in the Bavarian capital of Munich where 6.4 million revellers are expected over the next 16 days.

The annual beer festival's tents were packed well before lunchtime on Saturday as thousands of locals and tourists took part in a tradition that's taken place in some form since 1810, and inspired imitations the world over.

Sellers of traditional lederhosen and dirndls did a roaring trade in the lead-up with a majority of first-day festival goers looking the part.

The thousands who managed to gain entry on the opening day were undeterred by an average 2.58 per cent hike in the price of beer that this year exceeds the 10 Euro mark in some halls. In seven of the festival's main tents in its heartland in Munich, punters will part with at least the equivalent of £8 for a glass measuring 1.76 UK pints, of which two out of three won't be filled properly according to an official on duty last year.  

The annual festival brings hundreds of millions to the local economy, with an estimated £252m flowing at the venues themselves, while hotels and hostels get a boost of more than £230m for their hugely inflated room rates.  

Oktoberfest runs until October 5.
