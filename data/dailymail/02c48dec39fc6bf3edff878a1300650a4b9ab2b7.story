Suicide: An autopsy report has confirmed that director Tony Scott killed himself in August

Filmmaker Tony Scott had anti-depressants and sleeping pills when he killed himself by jumping off a bridge in August, an autopsy report revealed on Monday.

The report by the Los Angeles County coroner confirmed that the Top Gun director's death was a suicide, and listed the cause of death as multiple blunt force injuries.

It said that he also drowned after leaping from the Vincent Thomas Bridge into Los Angeles harbour on August 19.

Scott had therapeutic levels of the anti-depressant Remeron and the sleep aid Lunesta in his system when he died, the report has revealed.

It has long been assumed that the director had killed himself, as he left a number of apparent suicide notes in his car when he died.

However, the notes did not suggest any motive for the suicide, and his death certificate did not initially list a cause.

Initial reports that he had been suffering from terminal brain cancer have now been confirmed to be incorrect.

'There was no evidence of neoplasia - cancer - identified,' coroner Craig Harvey told the Los Angeles Times.

He added that Scott did not appear to have been suffering from any serious long-term illness at all.

911 tapes released earlier this month revealed that at least five female motorists reported seeing  Scott leap to his death.

The 68-year-old filmmaker committed suicide by jumping off Vincent 
Thomas Bridge, linking the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, in broad 
daylight on August 19 in full view of boaters and passing drivers.

‘We are just on the Vincent Thomas 
Bridge and there’s a guy that looks like he’s just about to jump off … 
he’s jumped, he’s jumped, [off] the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro!’
 said one 911 caller.

Another witness reported the fatal 
leap to 911 operators, and was then transferred to a fire dispatcher. 
During the transfer, she could be heard gasping: ‘Oh my God.’

The caller said: ‘He was a bald white guy. Oh my gosh, he just jumped off the bridge. We actually witnessed the whole thing.’

Motorists driving over the bridge 
reported seeing a black Toyota Prius, lights still flashing, parked on 
the side, as an older white male climbed a pole before leaping more than
 185 feet into the water.

Scott had been preparing to do a sequel to his 1986 Tom Cruise hit Top Gun.

He and Cruise were spotted in Fallon,
 Nevada — where the Navy’s Top Gun program had been based before moving 
to San Diego — meeting with Navy officials, a week before the suicide.

Unclear: His death certificate initially failed to list a cause of death for the well-known director

Coroner's office spokesman Ed Winter 
says one of the notes left in Scott's black Toyota Prius was a list of 
emergency contact numbers and another found in his study included 
messages to friends and loved ones.

The note in the car listed names and 
contact numbers - including that of his wife - so police could call his 
friends to tell them of his death, TMZ reported.

The mystery surrounding the suicide 
deepened after the chairman of 20th Century Fox said that the director 
was 'burning with excitement' over new projects just two weeks before 
his suicide.

'We had a meeting just two weeks ago 
and he was burning with the excitement of creating stuff,' said Tom 
Rothman.

Scott had more big-budget Hollywood 
films lined up, but his death has left them in limbo, as well as 
stunning his family and friends.

Friends of the director said that he 
had no marriage or money problems and was focused on the 'Top Gun' 
sequel which was preparing to go into production early next year.

Scott was also in pre-production on 
an underwater drug-trafficking thriller 'Narco-Sub', another smuggling 
drama 'Lucky Strike' and a remake of the 1969 western 'The Wild Bunch'.

While celebrity website TMZ reported 
that Scott's wife didn't know of any serious illness that may have been a
 motive, it raised the possibility that the director of Crimson Tide 
may have kept his illness secret.

If not there must have been a 
different reason behind his decision to leap from the Vincent Thomas 
Bridge in Long Beach on Sunday afternoon.

He left a contact list of people to 
be informed about the tragedy in the Toyota Prius he abandoned before 
climbing a fence and jumping into the Pacific.

The director was said to have leaped to his death 'without hesitation' 
in an effort to spare his family the pain of watching his slow death, 
ABC News reported.

But hours later, ABC backed away from that report and the Los Angeles Times confirmed that Scott's family told the corner's office Scott did not have cancer - or any major illness.

'The
 family told us it is incorrect that he has inoperable brain cancer,' 
Craig Harvey, a chief at the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office told 
the newspaper.

The denial of his brain cancer begs the question - what could have driven the successful director, whose 
films have grossed more than $2 billion and who left behind a young family, to kill himself?

Tony Scott's tragic death came just 
weeks after he was pictured looking pained as he left a Beverly Hills 
restaurant on July 23 - but friends denied he had problems in his 
marriage to wife Donna.

A source told the New York Post: 'He did have 
cancer, and for a while he was cancer free. He didn’t have any money 
problems or marriage problems.'

The beloved filmmaker, who
 directed movies including Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop II and Enemy Of 
The State and was the younger brother of director Ridley Scott,  fell within feet of a cruise boat as horrified tourists watched.

'He landed right next to our tour boat, and many 
of us saw the whole thing,' a witness, who had been on the cruise around the Los Angeles Harbour, told TMZ.

According to the Contra Costa Times, Scott climbed a fence on the south side of the bridge, which spans San Pedro and Terminal Island, and leaped off 'without hesitation'.

A witness, who was a passenger in a car driving along the bridge, said Scott looked nervous.

'He was on the roadway close to the fence looking around. He was looking around and fumbling with something at his feet. He looked nervous,' David Silva told the Los Angeles Times.

Silva thought he was a stuntman or taking part in an extreme sports event - until he realised there was no safety cord.

He went on: '[He] paused a couple of seconds and then began
 to climb the fence. He put his foot on the top of the fence and paused 
again. Then he threw himself off. I immediately thought, that guy is
 dead.'

Friends told the New York Post they were not surprised that the director chose to leap to his death as he was a thrill-seeker who loved scaling high mountains.

Several people called 911 around 
12.35pm to report that someone had jumped off the bridge, according to Los Angeles police Lt. Tim 
Nordquist.
