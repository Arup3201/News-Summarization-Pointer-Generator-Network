Botox is commonly used to smooth out wrinkles, but new research suggests it could be used to help asthma sufferers.

In a world first, doctors in Australia injected Botox directly into the vocal cords of asthma patients who were struggling to breathe.

These patients also suffered from a condition called vocal cord dysfunction which causes muscle spasms that make breathing difficult.

The Botox partly paralysed the muscles, allowing them to relax and make breathing easier.

This effect lasted for between two and three months.

A group of 11 patients received up to 24 injections, with 60 per cent reporting significant reductions in symptoms. 

The injections partially paralyse the muscles causing them to relax - the effect lasts for up to three months

‘Local injection of botulinum toxin -
 Botox - may be an effective treatment for intractable asthma associated
 with abnormal vocal cord movement,’ said Professor Phillip Bardin from 
Melbourne’s Monash Health.

‘Some of our patients had one or two injections, improved markedly and didn’t need any more treatment.

‘Overall, the patients improved because they’re not as breathless as they have been in the past.’

However, there were some side effects with patients experience a softening of their voices.

The researchers say, though, that none struggled to swallow after the treatment.

Patient Lyn Dowsey, 68, has suffered severe asthma for years.

Eventually, her voice box became affected and she felt like she was being strangled.

She said: ‘It was terrible. I could lie down, but as soon as I stood up, I’d be gasping.

‘It felt like there was a ball in my throat like I was being strangled. It was shocking.

‘Now I can get up off my seat and move around without struggling to breathe.’

She added: ‘I did ask the doctor if he could inject it into other places to make me look better, but that didn’t happen!’

The medical trial took 18 months of research and a team of 11 researchers.
