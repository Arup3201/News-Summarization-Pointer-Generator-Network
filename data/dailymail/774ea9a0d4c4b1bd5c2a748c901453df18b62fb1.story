All eyes will be on The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son Prince George next Tuesday, 22nd July, as the future king celebrates his first birthday.

To commemorate the date, this beautiful set of pictures has been released, depicting Royal babies over the past 87 years.

The oldest photograph from the set dates all the way back to 27th June 1927, and portrays the Duke and Duchess of York with King George V and Queen Mary and the 
then Princess Elizabeth, now Queen Elizabeth II, on the balcony of 
Buckingham Palace.

An adorable family portrait shows Princess Elizabeth with her children Prince Charles and Princess Anne on her 1st birthday, taken on 15th August 1951.

And 1949, Prince Charles is pictured about to turn one himself. At 11 1/2 
months Charles weighed 24 1/2 lbs, had six teeth and could walk a few
 steps by holding onto the sides of his play pen.
