Fried chicken chain KFC has said it intends to honor its commitment to donate $30,000 towards Victoria Wilcher’s medical bills despite no evidence that it's employees did anything wrong.

Two different investigations have failed to find any evidence that an employee asked the 3-year-old girl and her grandmother to leave because injuries she suffered in a pit bull mauling disturbed customers.

KFC spokesman Rick Maynard said on Tuesday the company considered the matter closed after an internal investigation by the franchise restaurant in Jackson, Mississippi, and an independent probe.

Hoax victim? A source involved in the 
investigation said all the evidence in the case points towards 
the matter being a hoax and that Victoria Wilcher, three, wasn't asked 
to leave a KFC in Mississippi

‘Like the rest of America, the KFC family has been moved by the story of Victoria's injuries and recovery,’ Maynard said. ‘We hope everyone keeps Victoria in their thoughts and prayers. She will certainly be in ours.’

Allegations that Victoria was asked to leave the restaurant were made earlier this month on the Facebook site Victoria's Victories, which has followed her recovery from the April attack.

According to a statement issued on Tuesday by the family’s attorney Bill Kellum, Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, stands by her claim of what happened at the restaurant.

'Victoria's family appreciates the actions of KFC in their investigation of this matter. They look forward to assisting KFC in what we hope will be an ongoing investigation,' he said.

'It is deeply disappointing that other parties have taken opportunity to attack Victoria through social and news media outlets. Victoria is an innocent child with very real physical and emotional scars.

'The focus of her family has always been, and will always be on Victoria and making her whole again,' Kellum said. He said the child's family is grateful for outpouring of concern for her.

The family-maintained Facebook page called Victoria's Victories also issued a statement on Tuesday denying that the whole thing was hoax, although just hours later the page was taken down.

'I promise its not a hoax, I never thought any of this would blow up the way it has. ... Please do not believe untrue media. I have personally watched this family go without to provide for Victoria. They have not and would not do anything to hurt Victoria in any way,' read the statement.

After the family's story became public, donations poured into the family's fund-raising effort at www.gofundme.com. Before
 the story hit the headlines, the page for Victoria had 
raised only $600, but since then more than $135,000 has been raised.

who claimed they had been asked to leave, didn't even visit the 
restaurant that day

The CEO of the fund-raising webpage GoFundMe, Brad Damphousse, issued a statement on Tuesday suspending the campaign and offering to refund donations, reports CNN.

'In lieu of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the "Victoria's Victories" online fundraising effort, GoFundMe has temporarily suspended the campaign until the full truth is made clear,' the statement said.

Hannon Food Services, which operates the KFC restaurant, also issued a statement in which said it said it was deeply troubled by the allegation.

As part of its investigation, Hannon said it spent hundreds of hours reviewing surveillance video, interviewing employees and hired the outside investigator. The company said it would reach out to the child's family for additional discussions.

Victoria Wilcher, who lost an eye in a dog attack, made headlines earlier this month after her family posted a photo entitled 'Does this face look scary to you?' on a Facebook page, Victoria's Victories.

Denial: In a statement posted on Facebook on Tuesday, the family denied they had made up the story and said the investigation was ongoing

The allegations against KFC drew widespread condemnation and prompted the chain to donate $30,000 towards Victoria’s charity, as an independent review was launched into the incident.

An unnamed source involved in the investigation told the Laurel Leader-Call that all the evidence in the case suggests the story told by Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, on May 15 was a hoax.

After reviewing surveillance tape from the Woodrow Wilson Drive branch – and another in Jackson - investigators found that the woman and the little girl didn't even visit the restaurant that day.

The grandmother had also previously told WAPT that she ‘ordered a sweet tea and mashed potatoes and gravy’ at the restaurant before they were asked to leave.

But
 a review of transactions on May 15 at both Jackson locations found 
those items weren’t included in the same order at any point.

And no one
 matching the description of Mullins or Victoria visited either 
restaurant, the Leader-Call reported. 'It just didn’t happen,' the 
source told the newspaper.

Apology: The family shared the alleged story on Victoria's Facebook page and KFC was quick to apologize

Victoria had been injured in April when three of her grandfather's pit 
bull dogs ran into his home in Simpson County by ripping through the back door of the home before jumping on her.

They dragged the little girl outside into the backyard, where they
 continued to maul her before her grandfather, Donald Mullins, and his 
girlfriend, Rita Tompkins, attempted to stop the carnage.

The dogs then 
attacked their owners, causing Mullins to shoot them. Two of the dogs 
were killed.

Victoria was rushed to the emergency room. She suffered a shattered top and 
bottom jaw, broken cheekbones and eyesockets, a broken nose, lost her
 right eye, and lost the ability to move the right side of her face.

Mullins and Tompkins were arrested on charges of child endangerment and their eight surviving pit bulls were seized by Animal 
Control officers.

Victoria was in the hospital for a month after the attack and upon her return home, she 
continued with physical therapy and wore a feeding tube.

Getting better: She is expected to undergo several more surgeries in the future as she heals from the attack

On
 Saturday, Las Vegas plastic surgeon Frank Stile flew out to Jackson 
after hearing the story and pledged to donate the costs of covering the 
expensive reconstructive procedures, likely in the tens of thousands of 
dollars.

Dick West, who owns
 the local Jackson KFC franchises, posted on Facebook about the incident
 on Saturday.

'When
 the allegation was first made, KFC pledged $30,000 to go to medical 
expenses and started an investigation to find the truth,' he wrote.

'They have pledged the money even if it is proven that the incident 
never happened. At this point their story is full of holes. Any thinking
 person who follows their timeline can see it. The event at KFC never 
happened.'

It is unclear if Kelly Mullins will face criminal charges if found to have made up the incident.
