A 21-year-old has posted a video of the sagging skin he was left with across his body after his dramatic weight loss.

John David Glaude, from El Cajon, California, used to weigh 360 lbs, but dropped to 200 lbs through diet and exercise.

He posted the video online to show people that although he now has sagging skin -  which makes him insecure -  he is proud of his achievements - and finally has a much-wanted girlfriend.

He says that although his arms look good when he flexes them as he works out - the reality is there is still loose skin

'Being overweight, you're obviously very self-conscious about how you look,' he says.

'Losing the weight, I'm not as self conscious when I have a layer over my skin.

'I'm comfortable clothed, but I'm not that comfortable unclothed.'

Glaude, whose Facebook lists him working at Starbucks,  undresses in front of the camera, revealing the excess skin he has gained since losing weight.

He posted the video online to show people that although he now has sagging skin, which does make him insecure, he is proud of his achievements

'You should never let loose skin stop you from going for your dream,' he says. 'Loose skin and all, I am happy with where I have come from and where I'm at now

He says: 'If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish great things! I was 360 pounds, sad, alone, and had no clue how to make myself any happier'

He said he wanted to post the video so he could manage his insecurities about his body and inspire others to do the same.

'You should never let loose skin stop you from going for your dream,' he says. 

'Loose skin and all, I am happy with where I have come from and where I'm at now.

'This is who I am and I'm proud of it.'

He says: 'If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish great things! I was 360 pounds, sad, alone, and had no clue how to make myself any happier.

'Then one night my whole life changed, I decided I was done being morbidly obese and hating myself. 

'I knew I was worth more than I was giving myself credit for.

'The path is was going down, I was going to die in my thirties. 

He says he decided to stop eating fast food and drinking soda and realized that a healthy diet was key to his weight loss. 

'A few months after that I got a gym membership, and I never looked back,' he says.

Glaude says that although the gym was initially intimidating, several times other members came up and congratulated him on his efforts. 

He admits at one point he lost his motivation and stopped going to the gym for about five months, but he was able to continue losing weight because still ate healthily. 

Glaude used to often post on his Facebook wall that he was lonely but he now has a girlfriend as of last month.
