Boeing has asked for permission to start test flights of its 787 Dreamliner as the investigation into the battery fires which have grounded the flagship aircraft continues.

The company is awaiting the green light from the U.S Federal Aviation Administration to resume flights with test planes so that investigators can study the lithium-ion packs in the air.

A decision has not yet been made but analysts expect Boeing to be given the go-ahead.

Positive step: Boeing has asked for permission to carry out fresh test flights with the 787 Dreamliner jet

The move comes despite shocking images which were released yesterday of the charred remains of the battery which spontaneously combusted in Japan.

Pictures released by the Japanese Transportation Safety Board showed the blackened lithium device with frayed and broken earth wire.

Investigators are trying to establish the cause of an in-flight fire which forced an All Nippon Airways flight to make an emergency landing in Japan last month.

All 50 Boeing 787s belonging to eight airlines in seven different countries remain grounded while investigations continue.

CAT scans of the overheated 
lithium ion battery revealed similar damage to an incident just over a 
week earlier on January 7 which saw another Dreamliner make an emergency
landing in Boston.

The
latest probe is said to have found evidence of short-circuiting and 
'thermal runaway' - a chemical reaction which causes overheating.

The
All Nippon Airways flight made an emergency landing in western Japan 
after a cockpit message warned of battery problems and a burning smell 
was detected in the cockpit and cabin.

Damage: A ground wire which was attached to the burnt battery is showed charred, frayed and broken

An
investigator in Japan at the time said the burned insides of the 
plane's lithium ion battery showed the battery received voltage in 
excess of its design limits.

But on Monday Boeing filed a request with the FAA to resume test flights to establish whether conditions in-flight are linked to the battery problems.

The company performed thousands of hours of tests on the six-jet development fleet before the planeâ€™s 2011 commercial debut.

But a week ago, Elon Musk, the
founder of Tesla Motors said the batteries used by Boeing in its 
Dreamliner aircraft are 'inherently unsafe' - after it emerged that an 
airline replaced the batteries ten times before all 787s were grounded.

All
Nippon Airways said it had to replace the batteries on its 787 
aircraft ten times because they failed to charge properly or showed 
other problems.

And Japan Airlines also said it had replaced batteries on the 787 'on a few occasions'.

Lithium
ion batteries are more susceptible to catching fire when they overheat 
and are more likely to short-circuit than other types of batteries.

Boeing
built in safeguards to gain safety certification for use of the 
relatively light and powerful batteries to power various electrical 
systems on the 787, the world's first airliner made mostly from 
lightweight composite materials.

The string of disasters could 
potentially cost Boeing billions although shares rose 0.9 percent to $75.89 at the close in New York yesterday.

The
Dreamliner has been seen as key a part in Boeing's plans to take on European giants 
Airbus and despite the delays in production, they were able to 
re-capture the crown as the world's largest maker of passenger jets last
year, overtaking Airbus for the first time in a decade.
