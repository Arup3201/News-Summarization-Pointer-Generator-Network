Liverpool looked unusually jovial in training ahead of their huge clash with bitter rivals Manchester United - with stars including Mario Balotelli, Steven Gerrard and Raheem Sterling appearing to laugh their way through the session with gags and jokes.

Manager Brendan Rodgers also appeared in high spirits as he put his players through passing and running drills at Liverpool's Melwood Training Ground on Friday.

And all this despite the Reds' disappointing Champions League exit at the hands of Swiss champions Basle at Anfield on Tuesday night.

Gerrard, as is so often the case, gave Liverpool a lifeline against Basle with a magnificent free-kick to make the score 1-1 but they could not find a winner, meaning they finished third in their group and will now go into the pot for the Europa League's last 32.

But, instead of appearing down in the dumps, Rodgers' squad enjoyed a laugh and a joke in training on Friday - hugging each other, playing handball and generally seeming to enjoy themselves during the season. 

Balotelli, clad in a red-and-white striped scarf and a LFC hat, particularly looked in a positive mood, smiling and laughing with his team-mates.

The £16million summer signing has flattered to deceive so far this campaign, contributing just one goal and failing to net in the Premier League, but he is expected to return to the Liverpool squad for Sunday's trip to Old Trafford.

Rodgers bought Balotelli to make the difference in important games and few come bigger for Liverpool fans than Manchester United.

A victory for the Reds and they would move just four points behind their rivals.

However, a loss on Sunday would see Louis van Gaal's men open up a 10-point gap on Liverpool with 16 games of the season gone.

Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet also appeared composed in training, despite recent criticisms of his performances.

The stopper has been at fault  in recent weeks for mistakes which had led to the Reds conceding goals, so he will need to be back to his best form to prevent United's world-class strikeforce of Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Radamel Falcao finding the back of the net.
