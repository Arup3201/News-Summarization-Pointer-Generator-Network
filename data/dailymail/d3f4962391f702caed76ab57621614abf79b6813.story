The world has a chance to beam from outer space as NASA encourages people to smile for its cameras while it takes a photo of Saturn that will feature the Earth.

To encourage people to take part in the Day the Earth Smiled event on July 19, NASA has released directions so people across the world know which way to face and at what time.

Those worried about how they may look in the shots, taken 898 million miles away, can find reassurance that the planet will appear only as a tiny blue blob in the pictures.

'While Earth will be only about a pixel in size from Cassini's vantage point 1.44 billion kilometers away, the team is looking forward to giving the world a chance to see what their home looks like from Saturn,' Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist in Pasadena, California, said.

'We hope you'll join us in waving at Saturn from Earth, so we can commemorate this special opportunity.'

Although the space agency has taken 
pictures of Saturn before, when the Cassini spacecrafts takes its photos
on July 19  Earth will be included in the shots, the Daily News said.

The Earth has only been pictured in images from outer space on two other occasions. The first was  in 1990, when Voyager 1 captured an image 
from 3.7 billion miles away. The second occasion was when Cassini took a photo in 2006 from 926 million 
miles away.

NASA is taking the image on July 19 because Saturn will be backlit by the Sun and Earth will also be included in the picture.

The photoshoot, dubbed 'The Day Earth Smiled' will start at 5.27pm EST and will take 15 minutes to complete on Friday. 

Space fans are being encouraged to upload photos of them taking part to social media sites, including NASA's Wave at Saturn Facebook page. 

It will not be possible to see the planet in daylight, but after the Sun sets on Friday and Saturday, Saturn and Venus will be visible.

The main purpose of the photograph is to study any changes in Saturn's rings, after an 2006 image showed possible changes. 

'A previous mosaic of the Saturn system Cassini made in 2006 revealed that the dusty E ring, which is fed by the water-ice plume of the moon Enceladus, had unexpectedly large variations in brightness and color around its orbit,' Cassini scientist Linda Spilker said.

'We'll want to see how that looks seven Earth years and a Saturnian season later, giving us clues to the forces at work in the Saturn system,' she said.
