From glitzy costumes to game day nerves; frantic practices and solemn pep talks, a photographer has documented the physically demanding, high-pressure but often not high-glamor world of marching bands.

Texan Walker Pickering, himself a former tuba player in his own high school band, decided to turn his lens on Friday Night football’s other team and all the effort they put in for game day - religiously recording both high school and college marching bands since 2009.

For Pickering, the most incredible moments are captured off rather than on the field.

For Pickering the most incredible moments are captured off rather than on the field. As such his collection gives an intimate portrait of the hard work band members put in

‘I don’t usually like to shoot performances at football games so much,’ he told Slate. 

‘It’s just so boring. It’s what everyone shoots. I’m interested in having a lot of behind the scenes access, that’s what I value and what I’m interested in doing.’

As such his collection gives an intimate portrait of the hard work band members put in. 

His bright and brilliant images document drills on the practice field; bugle players squeezing in quick practice sessions outside arenas and, in some instances quite literally, the blood sweat and tears that go into a performance.

Lowly high school organisations often do it more for the love of music and due to the work of a handful of dedicated teachers rather than the love of the crowd

‘When I got into band, I finally felt like I was part of something bigger than me and it was really exciting,’ Pickering said

The high school bands photographed were all performing in Texas but Pickering also takes photos of the band at the University of Texas and the University of Nebraska—Lincoln where he is a photography professor in the art department

The incredible achievement of marching bands has come into mainstream focus with the viral success of college bands like Ohio State or The Best Damn Band in the Land.

That band’s Michael Jackson and Hollywood themed performances have garnered them 11 and 16 million Youtube hits respectively

However, this fanfare isn’t usually the case with more lowly high school organisations who often do it more for the love of music and due to the work of a handful of dedicated teachers rather than the love of the crowd.

‘When I got into band, I finally felt like I was part of something bigger than me and it was really exciting,’ Pickering continued.

‘But if you go to a football game it seems like a weird anachronism, a lot of the crowd doesn’t care. 

‘Before I got into marching band I wouldn’t say I was aimless, but I didn’t feel like I belonged,’ Pickering told Wired

‘In marching band I felt like I was a part of something bigger and it gave me some substantial goals. Band was a really big deal for me,' he said

The title of his series is called Espirit de Corps - it combines his passion for music and the camera 

'It’s almost for a lot of people, the marching band is tolerated, but I think [the band does] a really good job of trying to make themselves relevant within that culture,' Pickering said
