A woolly mammoth preserved in permafrost in Siberia could walk the Earth again after 10,000 years, after Russian academics signed a deal with a controversial Korean scientist to clone the animal.

Hwang Woo-Suk – who created the world’s first cloned dog, Snuppy, in 2005 – will implant the nucleus from a mammoth cell into an elephant egg to create a mammoth embryo.

The embryo will then be implanted into an elephant’s womb. The Koreans say research could begin this year.

Vasily Vasiliev, vice rector of North-Eastern Federal University of the Sakha Republic, signed the deal with Hwang Woo-Suk of South Korea's Sooam Biotech Research Foundation this week.

The agreeement follows the discovery of mammoth bones with well-preserved bone marrow in Siberia last summer.

Hwang Woo-Suk is a controversial figure some of whose research into human cloning was shown to be fake.   

But since then, his institute has successfully cloned other creatures such as cows, dogs and coyotes.

'The first and hardest mission is to restore mammoth cells,'  Sooam researcher, Hwang In-Sung, told AFP. 'This will be a really tough job, but we believe it is possible because our institute is good at cloning animals.'

The Korean biotech foundation said research would begin this year, as soon as the Russians ship remains.

The Russian academics are already in negotation with Japan's Kinki 
University for joint research next year aiming to 
recreate the giant mammal.

Mammoths became extinct about 10,000 years ago.

But the discovery in August in Siberia has increased the chances of a successful cloning.

Global
warming has thawed ground in eastern Russia that is usually almost 
permanently frozen, leading to the discoveries of a number of frozen 
mammoths, the report said.
