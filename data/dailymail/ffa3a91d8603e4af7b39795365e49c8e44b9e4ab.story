A 'hypersexual' woman who claims to have slept with 300 people is so addicted to carnal pleasure that she spends up to five hours a day having sex or pleasuring herself.

Nessa Jay, 24, from Cromer, Norfolk, finds her addiction to sex hard to deal with and she is even having therapy to try to curb it.

Speaking to The Sun's Jennifer Tippett, she said: 'I get sweaty palms, I feel angry and I need to satisfy myself if I don't get at least five orgasms a day through sex.'

Nessa, who describes herself on Twitter as a 'philosopher in sex toys' and 'boinkologist', reached her sexual peak when she was 19 and admitted that she used to have sex with 'anyone I could'. 

Nessa says she
 even used to meet sexual partners in the supermarkets. 'First I chat to them
 a bit to make sure they're not dangerous or odd but once I know they 
are OK we go home together,' she said.

She first discovered her thirst for sex after losing her virginity at the age of 16 but now channels much of her sexual energy in to her work as a sex toy reviewer.

She has tested 2,000 toys, and says the nature of her job helps her to deal with her cravings.

Nessa also says she's enjoyed sex with women and has had threesomes.

However, while she has been 
polyamorous in the past, she has one partner at the moment.

Her
 sexual appetite has in the past wreaked havoc with her friendships and many of her 
female friends have cut ties with her because they're worried their 
boyfriends may be attracted to her.

However, speaking
to Nick Conrad on BBC Radio Norfolk yesterday, she said: 'It's not all about sex, 
sometimes I won't have sex with them for months. We go out and have 
dinner, go to the cinema.

'I have slept with about thirty men in a month before but for years I had regular partners and that was it.

'There
 is an emotional side, I believe strongly that people should have some 
form of emotional connection to enjoy sex. It is often very intimate, I 
like physical connections and I have quite high standards actually.'

She has even forged a 'network' of 
sexual partners but doesn't want her nymphomania
 to define her and hopes people will view people with hypersexuality 
as 'normal'.

'I live an average life which most people my age would live. I see friends, I write, I have hobbies; it's pretty normal and pretty boring at times actually!

'I
 do not believe in sex addiction or nymphomania. My sex drive may be 
higher than some but it's healthy because I'm positive about it and I'm 
also a trained sex educator so I always make sure I have incredibly safe
 sex and get tested regularly.

'I'm perfectly healthy. I can't change who I am or how I act and I wouldn't want to,' she added.
