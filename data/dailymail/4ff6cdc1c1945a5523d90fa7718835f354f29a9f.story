Downton Abbey chiefs have come under fire for running Kindle adverts that 'ruin the period drama's atmosphere'.

The adverts show actors in 1920s costume using the devices on the set during breaks from filming the ITV show.

Viewers of the opening episode on Sunday night used Twitter to complain about the promotional spots which 'ruined the illusion' and 'killed the magic' of the show.

Viewers of the opening episode of the fifth series complained about the 'bumper' ads before, after and during the commercial breaks for the Amazon eReader which 'ruined the illusion' and 'killed the magic' of the show

Viewers took to Twitter to complain about the adverts which showed the actors holding Kindle's while still dressed in 1920s costume. Fans said the adverts did not fit in with the period drama's concept nor its plotline

Kate Vando said: 'The stupid Kindle advert is ruining the Downton Abbey magic for me.

'What sick ad agency came up with that idea?'

Chris Wimpress said: 'What spectacularly awful Kindle bumpers on Downton – unravels the drama before it even starts.' 

And Henrietta Bird added: 'You don't want to see actors on a set – breaks the period drama spell.'

The Kindle deal came in for the most criticism when the abbey went up in flames after Lady Edith threw her book into the fire – with viewers questioning whether they were witnessing some sort of subtle product placement.

Another Twitter user Barbara said: 'You know Downton is sponsored by a Kindle when a paperback sets fire to the house.'

Fans also pointed out that the sponsorship deal did not fit with the plotline, which saw members of the household unable to deal with changes in modern technology.

In 2011, the show was criticised for having one minute of advertising for every three minutes of drama.

A former sponsor, Aviva, drew complaints after showing a motorcyclist getting knocked off his bike and sustaining serious injuries.

The audience branded the ads 'depressing' and said they would put them off ever buying insurance policies from the company.

An ITV spokesman said: 'We work closely with sponsors in an attempt to ensure that their idents and creative concepts are complementary to the shows that they appear in.

'We apologise to any viewers who felt this was not achieved in last night's Downton Abbey.'

An average of 8.1million viewers tuned in to watch the start of the fifth series – one million fewer than last year's premiere. 

When the series launched in 2010, 7.7million watched the first episode. 

In comparison, series two and three attracted around 9million for their openers.

The figures will fuel rumours that Downton creator Julian Fellowes will decide to end the show sooner than previously hinted.
