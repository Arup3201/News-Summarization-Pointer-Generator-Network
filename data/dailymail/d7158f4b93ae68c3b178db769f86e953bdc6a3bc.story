How dopey can you get? By anyone's standards, it was a serious lapse of judgement.

A privately-owned Cessna aircraft that entered the same Los Angeles 
airspace as Marine One while the helicopter was ferrying President Barack 
Obama was intercepted by two fighter jets yesterday.

But after the small
 plane landed at Long Beach Airport, police then discovered it contained
 about 40 pounds of marijuana, a law enforcement official said.

The Secret Service said the president was never in any danger, despite the emergency procedure to remove the unauthorised aircraft from 'restricted airspace'.

Security alert: Marine One with President Barack Obama aboard flies over Long Beach, California, yesterday as two fighter jets intercepted a privately-owned Cessna aircraft that entered the same airspace

Intercepted: The Cessna 182 is met by officials after landing at Long Beach Airport. Police then discovered it contained 40 pounds of marijuana

The North American Aerospace Defense 
Command (NORAD) said it scrambled two F-16 fighters from March Air 
Reserve Base in Riverside County, California, to intercept a Cessna 182 
over Los Angeles at 2.30pm local time.

U.S.
 Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Virginia Kice said the 
department's Homeland Security Investigations unit questioned the pilot,
 who has been turned over to Long Beach police and remains in custody.

He will now face local prosecution, Ms Kice said.

NORAD spokesman Michael Kucharek declined to disclose how close the Cessna came to Marine One.

The
 Federal Aviation Administration had notified pilots that there was an 
eight-mile radius around Los Angeles International Airport that was 
off-limits to air traffic yesterday.

Mr Obama steps off Marine One at Los Angeles International Airport following the alert. The Secret Service said the president was never in any danger

The FAA had notified pilots that there was an eight-mile radius around Los Angeles International Airport that was off-limits to air traffic yesterday. The Cessna landed at the nearby Long Beach Airport

It was that radius that the Cessna violated, spokesman Brie Sachse said.

Ms
 Sachse declined to release the Cessna's tail number, saying the agency 
does not identify planes involved in security incidents.

After a short wait at LAX, Mr Obama 
took off aboard Air Force One to San Francisco - the flight was delayed 
by the appearance of the Cessna.

The president made it safely to San Francisco, where he was travelling to three fundraisers.

On the move: Mr Obama meets cancer patient Jodi Fisher following his arrival at San Francisco Internationl Airport later in the day

Speech: Mr Obama at a Democratic fundraiser at the Nob Hill Masonic Center in San Francisco last night

When
 he landed he met Jodi Fisher, a 44-year-old cancer patient who recently
 made headlines by handing out free ice cream in her hometown, which was
 on her 'bucket list'.

Meeting the President was also on the list, so White House staff arranged for her to greet him at San Francisco airport.

Air Force One is the name for any U.S. Air Force aircraft which is carrying the President.
