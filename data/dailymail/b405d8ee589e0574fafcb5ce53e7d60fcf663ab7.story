Comments: Gay rights campaigner Benjamin Cohen will make the comments, likening the experience of young gay men to that of Jesus on the cross, in a broadcast on Radio 4 later this week

The BBC is to broadcast an Easter message that likens the treatment of gay people to the death of Jesus.

The talk, which will be broadcast on Radio 4, will compare the 'abandonment' felt by gay men and women to that experienced by Christ as he died on the cross.

Former Channel 4 News presenter and gay rights campaigner Benjamin Cohen asks how people of faith can 'reject' their children 'for something they can't help'.

Referring to Jesus's final moments on
the cross after being handed over to the Romans, Mr Cohen says that those from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community often suffer similar experiences at the hands of religious groups.

The
talk, which will be broadcast later this week, will feature as part of 
the radio station's 'Lent Talk' series, focusing on the theme of 
'abandonment'.

Mr Cohen, 
who founded gay publisher Pink News, discusses his experience of growing
up in an Orthodox Jewish family and being educated in a Church of England
school.

He will say that since coming out as gay, he has learned to view Jesus differently in light of his suffering.

Mr
Cohen will argue that religion has been 'tearing families apart' and 
says that parents' rejection of their child's sexuality due to religious
beliefs has driven many children to suicide.

He
says: 'The feeling of abandonment by God in some ways has a resonance 
with the words of Christ in both the Gospels of Mark and Matthew, where 
he says, ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’'

Mr Cohen adds: 'Of course, I 
understand that for the very religious, it is difficult - an orthodox 
Jew really does believe the Torah is the literal word of God and a 
devout Catholic believes the Pope is infallible.

Criticism: Andrea Williams, director of Christian Watch, likened the comparison to Jesus as 'blasphemous' and questioned the BBC's decision to broadcast the comments by Benjamin Cohen during Lent

'But do people of faith really want to reject their children for something which I believe they can't help?

'Just as, the Jewish authorities rejected Christ - for something he considered he couldn't help- being the son of God?'

The comments have drawn criticism from religious groups who described the comparison as 'blasphemous'.

Andrea Williams, director of Christian 
Concern, said: 'Whilst we have immense compassion for those who feel 
rejection, to liken those who feel rejection because of behavioural 
choices they have made to Jesus is blasphemous.'

Miss Williams added: 'Jesus made high demands on how we are to behave particularly when it came to sexual expression, where he was clear that the only place for sexual expression is in the context of marriage between a man and a woman.'

She said that the BBC's timing of the talk is a 'serious matter' and said that the broadcaster should be looking to ‘educate and inform’ a population she claims knows ‘increasingly little about Jesus’.

In a related commentary for the Daily Telegraph, Mr Cohen criticises religious leaders for 'giving the impression that homosexuality is a choice'.

He says: 'I can promise you, it's not a choice, no one would chose to be different, to be discriminated against and to risk being abandoned by their family and their faith. I tried to have a girlfriend.'

Referring to Jesus being questioned on whether he was the Son of God, Mr Cohen adds: 'How different a situation is this to the questions and ultimatums given by some parents and some faiths to young gay people? Could Jesus have escaped his crucifixion by denying who he believed he really was?'

Director of Christian Aid Loretta 
Minghella also features in the Radio 4 series discussing selfishness, while 
Scottish author Alexander McCall Smith talks about ageing.

A BBC spokesman said: 'The theme of this year's Lent Talks is abandonment and features six well-known figures from public life, arts and religion.

'In this programme Benjamin Cohen talks about his personal fear of being abandoned by his own Jewish community for being gay.'
