Remorseful: Attorney for suspected gunman Aaron Ybarra, 26, pictured in court Friday, says he is sorry for the suffering he has caused by opening fire on Seattle Pacific University campus

The attorney for a former janitor suspected of 
killing one student in a shooting rampage at a small Christian Seattle university 
says he's sorry for the suffering he has caused.

Public defender Ramona Brandes says Aaron Ybarra, 26, is on suicide watch at the jail.

She
 says he has longstanding mental health issues and has been treated and 
medicated in the past, though she did not know his specific diagnoses.

Mountlake Terrace Police say Ybarra was hospitalized twice in recent years for mental health evaluations.

In 2010 and 2012, Ybarra was transported to a hospital after being found drunk. In the October 2012 incident, police officers found him lying in a roadway.

His attorney says her client wants to apologize for his actions, which left one person dead and two others wounded.

On Friday, authorities identified the student gunned down by Ybarra as Seattle Pacific University freshman Paul Lee, 19.

Shooting victim Sarah Williams, 19, was listed in critical but stable condition Friday, and 24-year-old Thomas Fowler was in stable condition.

Police say Ybarra wanted to kill more people before turning the gun on himself.

On Friday, a judge found probable cause to hold the 26-year-old without bail.

Speaking to KING5, Ybarra's friend Jason Wells described the 26-year-old as a 'good kid' who was 'dislodged from reality,' at least in part due to his alcohol problem. 

'He would say, "I’m going to kill everyone,"' Wells said. 'I never took him seriously.'

The Seattle Times reported that according to police, Ybarra had a fascination with mass shootings, particularly with the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.

In
 a statement filed in court, Seattle police wrote that Ybarra admitted 
to detectives after his arrest that he wanted to kill as many people as 
possible and then himself.

Instead,
 police say 26-year-old Jon Meis, a student building monitor, 
pepper-sprayed and tackled Ybarra as he reloaded his shotgun with the 
help of other students who were nearby.

Students at Seattle Pacific University say Meis saved countless lives when he sprang into action Thursday afternoon.

Meis, an engineering student, is engaged to be married and has 'everything to live for' friends said. But he risked his life and ended the murderous rampage.

'I'm proud of the selfless actions that my roommate, Jon Meis, showed today taking down the shooter. He is a hero,' tweeted Matt Garcia.

Unstable: Ybarra has longstanding mental problems and is now on suicide watch in jail

Classmate Briana Clarke told the Seattle Times that Meis, who was on duty as a hall monitor, sprayed the attacker in the face, grabbed him around the neck and then wrestled him to the ground.

'There were a lot of shells on the ground..it looked like he was planning to go the distance and Jon stopped him,' another student told KOMO-TV.

Several other students then piled on the attacker and held him until police arrived.

'But
 for the great response for the people at Seattle Pacific this incident 
would have been much more tragic,' assistant police chief Paul McDonagh 
said Thursday night.

One of Meis' roommates, Ryan Salgado, told The Seattle Times he 
seemed to be in shock afterward. A spokeswoman at Seattle's Harborview 
Medical Center said Friday Meis wasn't injured, but was suffering from 
mental anguish and was treated and released Thursday.

Paul Lee was shot in the head and died at a nearby 
hospital. Sarah Williams was struck in the neck and remains
 in critical condition.

Two 
other students, Thomas Fowler and another man in his 20s, were wounded 
but are in stable condition after sustaining minor injuries.

Lee hailed from Portland, Oregon, and was a graduate of Westview High School.

The 19-year-old’s grieving friends took to Twitter to express their disbelief at his violent and untimely death.

‘Paul
 Lee. I can't even believe you're gone. Ante up, math class, and just 
seeing you around campus and dancing with you brightened my life 
immeasurably. I am blessed and honored to have known you. You will live 
on through all of us and I expect you to teach us your dance from heaven
 at 6pm tonight,’ Sarrah Rasmussen commented on Instagram.

This is Aaron Ybarra, 26, who allegedly opened fire at Seattle Pacific University, killing one and wounding three

The college freshman was universally described as a positive person who always wore a smile on his face. His favorite pastime was dancing, and he belonged to several hip hop dance clubs in Portland and Seattle.

'Paul Lee was a ray of light in my classroom for three years,' Westview Japanese teacher Brian Bangerter said in a statement. 'It was impossible be around him and not feel happy. Everyone who knew him felt close to him.  He will always be remembered for his infectious positive attitude.  I know I will never forget him.'

The gunman has been identified as Aaron Ybarra. Authorities say he is not a student and has no connection to Seattle Pacific University or to any of his victims. Detectives are still trying to determine why he targeted the college.

KING-TV reports that Ybarra lives with his parents in the Seattle area. He has reportedly confessed to the 
shootings and even bragged about the carnage he inflicted on the campus.
 Authorities say he did not expect to survive the rampage.

His Facebook page says he is a former janitor at LA Fitness and attended Edmonds Community College prior to 2012.

In the panic, police believed there was a
 second shooter and searched for up to an hour, possibly delaying 
medical attention for the wounded, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports.

Witnesses 
said the gunman barged into Otto Miller Hall - the science and 
engineering building for the university - about 3.30pm on Thursday.

One
 witness told KIRO-TV that the gunman held his weapon on three students 
and told them not to move, when they did, he shot and wounded two and shot another student in the face.

The victim who was shot in the face was rushed to the hospital, where he died.

'The shooter began to reload his shotgun and a student that is the building monitor inside the hall confronted the shooter, was able to subdued the individual, and once on the ground, other students jumped on top of him and were able to pin the shooter to the ground until police arrived,' Seattle Police Captain Chris Fowler said in a press conference.

Seattle Pacific is a small Christian college associated with the Free Methodist Church with a student body just of about 4,370.

The university was placed on lockdown and
 the administrators advised students to stay inside and lock their 
windows and doors and close their blinds. Students were sent an email 
blast that warned: 'THIS IS NOT A DRILL.'

It's unknown whether the gunman is a student at the university or whether the victims were random strangers or targeted.

Some students told KCPQ-TV that they recognized the shooter, indicating that they might have recognized the gunman.

Video from KIRO-TV showed a young man who appeared to be in his late teens or early 20s being led away in handcuffs.
