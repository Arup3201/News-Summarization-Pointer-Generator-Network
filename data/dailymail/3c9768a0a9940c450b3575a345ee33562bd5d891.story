The Duke of Edinburgh will tonight attend his first public engagement since being discharged from hospital

The Duke of Edinburgh will tonight attend his first public engagement since being discharged from hospital almost a week ago following treatment for a bladder infection.

Philip will chair the Senior Colonels’ Conference at Buckingham Palace and host a dinner for the high-ranking officers in his role as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards.

The Duke was discharged from central London’s Edward VII hospital last Saturday quietly celebrating his 91st birthday with family the following day in Windsor.

He emerged after a five-night stay looking in good health and nodded when asked by the waiting media if he was feeling better.

But he did not attend the Queen’s visit to Nottingham with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Wednesday, and missed other Diamond Jubilee-related events during the week.

Although this evening will be a private engagement, Philip will make a public appearance tomorrow when he joins the Queen for the traditional Trooping the Colour ceremony.

The couple will ride in a carriage procession to the annual event, held in Horse Guards Parade, Whitehall, which marks the Queen’s official birthday.

A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman would not comment on the Duke’s health but said: 'The fact he’s attending engagements is an indication he is back to himself and able to carry out engagements.'

Philip’s last public engagement was at the height of the Diamond Jubilee weekend celebrations, when he joined the Queen and other members of his family on the royal barge for the spectacular River Thames Pageant on Sunday June 3.

He appeared to be in good spirits but the following day he was taken to hospital with a bladder infection.

Doctors have suggested that braving the 
elements on the deck the royal barge, Spirit of Chartwell, during the River Thames Jubilee pageant in cold and 
wet weather might have triggered his subsequent bladder 
infection.

Tonight’s conference will attended by all the colonels of the prestigious Household Division Regiments, many of whom are members of the Royal Family.

Good news: Prince Philip smiled and waved as he headed home to be with his family at Windsor for a private birthday celebration on Sunday

Philip will be joined by the Prince of Wales, of the Welsh Guards, William, of the Irish Guards, the Princess Royal, of the Household Cavalry’s Blues and Royals, and the Earl of Wessex, of the London Regiment.

The Duke will resume his normal duties next week and will attend the annual Order of the Garter service at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle, on Monday.

He is planning to return to the water on June 25  on a visit to 
Henley-on-Thames with the Queen where they will travel on the 130-year-old 
steam launch Alaska to witness the annual ceremony of swan upping.

The Royal couple will travel from 
Hambleden Lock in Berkshire across the river to the Henley Business 
School in Berkshire where they will disembark to watch the rest of the 
river pageant from the shore.

It
is understood Prince Philip is determined to be well enough to attend 
the river festivities but it will depend upon his doctors giving him the
all clear to go.

Treatment: Prince Philip's bladder infection could have been exacerbated by not taking enough toilet breaks during the Diamond Jubilee River Pageant
