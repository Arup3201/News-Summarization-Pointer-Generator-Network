It's not Friday yet, but this cute and fuzzy video might be just the thing to give you a little pick-me-up this Wednesday.

Last month, three snow leopard cubs were born at the Nordens Ark zoo in Bohuslän, Sweden.

To track the early days of their development, a webcam was installed in their den and the results are as heart-warming ass you would imagine.

The camera shows the furry friends play fighting, napping and just being generally adorable.

Snow leopards are notoriously elusive in the wild making them hard to study so this makes the live stream extra special.

Because it's live there's no guarantee that you will see much action all the time (they like to sleep a lot) but it's worth it when you do.

The staff at Nordens Ark said: 'With the new camera, we can follow the female and cubs in the den.

'We
study their behavior and may thus gain knowledge that is extremely 
important for those doing research on snow leopards in the wild.'

Nordens Ark is a non-profit organisation dedicated to the preservation of endangered species like the snow leopard.

They also recently welcomed a male Southern Pudu- the smallest baby deer in the world.
