David Cameron was accused of complacency over immigration from Romania and Bulgaria last night after claiming it was running at a 'reasonable level'

David Cameron was accused of complacency over immigration from Romania and Bulgaria last night after claiming it was running at a ‘reasonable level’.

The Prime Minister – who is facing a major Commons rebellion over EU immigration this week – said he ‘shares the frustrations’ of those who want tighter border controls.

But he suggested there was little sign of the influx of Romanian and Bulgarian workers predicted by some when transitional controls were lifted at the beginning of this month.

‘Now I think we can see, at the start of the year, so far there looks to be a reasonable level of migration,’ he said.

Mr Cameron was later forced to admit his comments were based purely on anecdotal evidence.

‘There aren’t any official statistics,’ he said. ‘I haven’t been looking at any unofficial statistics.

But just from what I read and see and hear, as you have, I think that these numbers look, as I said this morning, reasonable.’

Labour accused the Prime Minister of ‘making it up as he goes along’ while rebel Tories said he was guilty of complacency.

Mark Reckless, a Tory member of the Commons home affairs committee, said the first official statistics would not be published until May, with more reliable figures not due until October.

Mr Reckless, one of dozens of Tory MPs threatening to rebel on the Immigration Bill on Thursday, said: ‘Unless the Prime Minister has been hanging around Victoria Coach Station I don’t know what he is basing his comments on.

‘Even if numbers have been reasonable as he said, the problem is that may knock us off our target in terms of cutting immigration from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands.’

Tory
 Douglas Carswell said it was far too early to judge how many people 
would come from Romania and Bulgaria to work in industries such as 
tourism, construction and agriculture where many jobs are seasonal and 
demand increases later in the year.

Mr
 Carswell said: ‘I think it is complacent to suggest that because of the
 number who have moved here in the first few weeks this is not an issue.

'Labour made exactly the same mistake just over a decade ago when Poland and other Eastern European countries joined the EU.’

Ministers are braced for a series of potential rebellions on the Immigration Bill.

Arrivals: Romanian Victor Spirescu pictured meeting Keith Vaz as he arrived in the country on New Year's Day. He disappeared after spending one day working at a car wash

Commons sources said ministers look set to use time-wasting tactics to try to avoid the embarrassment of major rebellions, or even defeats, on Thursday.

Tory MPs are threatening to vote for the retrospective introduction of immigration controls on Romania and Bulgaria, despite Government warnings that the move would be illegal under EU law.

And former Labour home secretary David Blunkett has joined 100 Tory MPs demanding that foreign criminals should no longer be able to claim they have a right to a ‘family life’ in the UK to avoid deportation.

Ministers are promising to tighten the rules using the Immigration Bill, but backbench MPs say the changes would still leave the system open to abuse.
