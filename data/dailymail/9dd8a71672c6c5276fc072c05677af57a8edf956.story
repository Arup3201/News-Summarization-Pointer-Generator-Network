A woman lost seven stone in just five months by ditching a sugar addiction that saw her consume up to two litres of Pepsi a day.

Bozena Lisowicz, 28, who was 14st 9lb and wore size 18 clothes at her heaviest, became hooked on sugary treats and fatty, stodgy food as a mechanism to cope with anxiety.

She said: 'I thought food would kill me. I wasn't hungry, but I couldn't stop buying and eating treats.'

Bozena Lisowicz from Leeds used to eat two cheese sandwiches, a muffin, a can of cola and a large bowl of cereal for breakfast. After avoiding sugar, she went from 14st 9lb to 8st 6lbs in 23 weeks.

Bozena continued: 'I didn't spend a second of my time looking at the labels to see how much sugar and fat there was.'

The quality control technician from Leeds saw a rapid increase in her weight as she tried to improve a failing long-term relationship.

She said: 'My focus was entirely on my partner, I just wanted him to be happy. 

'But by doing so, I was making myself more and more anxious, and comfort eating even more.

'I loved cola, particularly Pepsi, and had a large bottle each day.'

After piling on the weight, Bozena began suffering excruciating pain in her knees.

In March 2012, when she was at her heaviest, she had an operation on her knees to help her 5ft 4in frame carry the extra load. 

Shortly afterwards, her relationship came to an end. 

Devastated, she dramatically cut her calorie intake and began losing weight at an alarming rate.

She said: 'I was extremely depressed. I starved myself because I had given up on life and didn't care whether I'd waste away or not.

'My behaviour wasn't healthy - starving yourself is no strategy for trying to lose weight.'

After two weeks of starvation, Bozena slowly increased her intake, bringing it up to healthier levels.

As she emerged from depression, she also gave up smoking. 

Before beginning her weight loss, she typically ate two ham or cheese sandwiches, with a muffin and a can of fizzy drink, followed by a large bowl of cereal with full-fat milk for breakfast. 

For lunch, she would eat a large bowl of pasta with cake or chocolate for dessert. 

For evening meals, she usually ate a meat feast pizza, but she would also snack on chocolate and cola during the day.

Having made the decision to live healthier, Bozena ate a small low-fat pot of cottage cheese with wholegrain crackerbreads and a low-fat yoghurt for breakfast, followed by a chicken salad for lunch.

She occasionally goes out for treat meals with friends but tries not to eat after 5pm and  also avoids snacking. 

Bozena has now replaced her size 18 wardrobe with size eight clothes after only five months of dieting and now weighs 8st 6lbs

She said: 'I didn't have any of the problems with saggy skin which I was expecting, because I used coconut butter to firm my skin.'

This year, she has started studying psychology and counselling and is starting training with The Samaritans in January, so that she may be able to help others through their struggles.

She said: 'Now my hunger is for knowledge - for finding new things, for looking at society. I really enjoy that.

'I would love to help people who are in the place I've been. 

'I know how it feels for people with depression, who are suicidal or have eating disorders.'
