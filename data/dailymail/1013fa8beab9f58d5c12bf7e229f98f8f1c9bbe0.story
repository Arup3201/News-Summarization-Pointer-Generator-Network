One of Australia's most powerful women is at loggerheads with top Cabinet Ministers over her attempts to micro manage Julie Bishop and steal Joe Hockey's thunder, it has been reported.

The disdain felt amongst numerous MPs towards Peta Credlin, the prime minister's right hand woman and the person he credits with securing his party's election, has come to light and exposes the over-reaching responsibilities she has assumed - from picking Tony Abbott's blue ties to taking part in the budget's development.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is understood to have been involved in a feud with Credlin after her extensive attempt to micro manage the government included controlling minister's media appearances, according to John Lyons of The Australian.

The disdain felt amongst numerous MPs towards Peta Credlin, the prime minister's chief of staff, has come to light

They claim the over-reaching responsibilities she has assume include picking Tony Abbott's blue ties and taking part in the budget's development

In an incident that fractured their relationship, Bishop slammed Credlin who voiced her disapproval of a media appearance by the minister that had not been authorized by Credlin. Bishop is said to have reminded Abbott's chief of staff that she was the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and did not require her permission. 

The parliamentary strife comes amidst reports that Mr Abbott proposed an Australian-led invasion of Iraq to his top Australian military advisors - who blanched at the idea - a move that Credlin showed no opposition to, according to The Australian.

Meanwhile, Treasurer Joe Hockey's grievances with Credlin are also understood to have stemmed from her tendency to over-step her mark and take control.

At a small celebration following the release of the party's first budget, Credlin undermined the Treasurer by having the first word - leading the toast, and ultimately taking ownership of an accomplishment that should have been Hockey's to savour, The Australian reports.

The incident symbolises the over-reaching role that Credlin has taken on. Aside from her responsibilities of managing staff, Credlin decides who runs each minister's office, often answers media's questions directed at Mr Abbott and ultimately chooses who can speak to him and when.

New claims that she had on occasion led the Expenditure Review Committee and determined the agenda, were quickly denied by Finance Minister Mathias Cormann on Saturday morning who told Sky News that 'never never happened'.

Backbenchers have even revealed to The Australian that a popular term amongst the Liberals is 'Credlined' AKA 'to be beheaded', a term that compliments her well known nickname, 'The Queen of No'.

But Abbott's devotion to Credlin is unmoving. The prime minister has defended her time and time again, calling her 'the fiercest political warrior I've ever worked with'.

He is known to have told associates that raised complaints against her: 'you wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Peta'. 

However his own performance is now also under scrutiny  after his push to send 3,500 troops to fight against Islamic State terrorists in Iraq was met with 'stunned' reactions from military officials in November last year, The Australian reports.

They shot down the controversial proposition, saying it was 'disastrous' and had not even been a consideration of the U.S.   

The parliamentary strife comes amidst reports that Mr Abbott proposed an Australian-led invasion of Iraq to his top Australian military advisors - who blanched at the idea - a move that Credlin showed no opposition to

Mr Abbott denied the claims, calling them 'absolutely fanciful', adding 'we do not act unilaterally in the Middle East'.

Mr Cormann also denied that the incident occurred, telling Sky News 'that story is wrong... the Prime Minister never sought such advice'.

This is despite previous reports Mr Abbott had also considered sending 1000 Australian troops to Ukraine after Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot out of the sky, before military officials again disputed the idea.
