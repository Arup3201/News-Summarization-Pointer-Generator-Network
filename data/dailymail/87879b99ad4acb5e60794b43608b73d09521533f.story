Harry Redknapp has stunned Queens Park Rangers by quitting the club with the Loftus Road outfit embroiled in a relegation battle.

Redknapp, joined QPR in November 2012, but he claims he is ending his managerial tenure to undergo knee replacement surgery. 

Rangers chairman Tony Fernandes accepted the former Tottenham manager's resignation just a day after tweeting there would be 'no more cheque book' as the transfer window slammed shut on Monday.

QPR are languished in a relegation dogfight 

Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey will take temporary charge instead of Glenn Hoddle, who has been working as part of Redknapp's backroom team. Tim Sherwood meanwhile, has been installed as the early favourite to take over at Loftus Road. 

Redknapp had been under intense pressure for months with QPR languishing in a relegation dogfight, fending off what he claimed was a club insider trying to undermine his position.

His side are 19th in the Premier League and have not picked up a single point away from home in their 11 matches this term.

The 67-year-old's shock exit comes after a 3-1 defeat at Stoke on Saturday and an abject final day in the transfer window where he missed out on Emmanuel Adebayor, Aaron Lennon. and Matt Jarvis. He cut a forlon figure as the left Loftus Road late on Monday night.

He informed chairman Tony Fernandes of his decision at 5.30am on Tuesday morning.

'I have had such a fantastic time at QPR,' said Redknapp. 'I would like to thank the board, the players and all my staff, and especially the supporters who have been absolutely fantastic to me since I arrived at the club for their tremendous support.

Redknapp, who spent six weeks on crutches in the summer of 2013 after he underwent surgery to fix a knee cartilage problem, added: 'Sadly I need immediate surgery on my knee which is going to stop me from doing my job in the coming weeks. It means I won’t be able to be out on the training pitch every day, and if I can’t give 100 per-cent I feel it’s better for someone else to take over the reins.

'My relationship with Tony Fernandes has been one of the highlights of my footballing career and I wish the club every success. I am confident they will survive in the Premier League this year.'

Sherwood leads the race to replace Redknapp and has been out of work since leaving Tottenham last summer, although he has been in contention for jobs at Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion. 

Ferdinand was appointed head of football operations at the club in October and was soon followed on to the staff by Ramsey in a role on the club's academy. 

The pair worked together at Tottenham last season as assistants to Sherwood when he took over from Andre Villas-Boas at White Hart Lane.

Their presence at Loftus Road and Ferdinand’s close relationship with owner Fernandes has fuelled speculation for some time that Redknapp would be ousted in favour of Sherwood. And that the triumvirate from Spurs would soon be back together.

Sherwood needed special dispensation from the Premier League to operate as a manager at Spurs because he did not have the UEFA Pro Licence required to do the job. He had to enrol for the first available course and is midway through it with the Football Association of Wales. It will be completed later this year. 

Redknapp cited his need for a knee replacement operation in the announcement from QPR but he has slowly become infuriated by what he regards as a whispering campaign to force him out. 

Rangers were chasing a number of targets on deadline day including Emmanuel Adebayor and Aaron Lennon but failed to complete any of them.

Redknapp looked dejected as he left Loftus Road at the end of a long day and his resignation was tendered hours later.

He took charge of 105 matches at the Loftus Road club winning 36 games, but his win rate in his 48 Premier League matches was only 19 per cent.
