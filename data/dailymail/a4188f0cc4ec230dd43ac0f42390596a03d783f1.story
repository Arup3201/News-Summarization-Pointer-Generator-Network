Saying you love your friend's new (ugly) shoes can strengthen your bond

Lying to your loved ones may seem like a sure fire way to push them away.

But new research says telling white lies - specifically for the right reasons - can actually strengthen social bonds.

Fibbing about how good your friend looks in a (bad) dress or how much you love your partner's (awful) new haircut tends to be good for relationships.

But lying to cover up a misdeed or just to get your way is not the way to improve your relationships, says Robin Dunbar, evolutionary psychologist at Oxford University.

This type of deception, known as antisocial lying, is destructive and weakens bonds between two people.

On the other hand, lies told to help another person or to protect someone's feelings tend to be good for relationships, Dunbar said.

Psychologists call this pro-social lying, but it's more commonly known as telling a white lie or a fib.

To study how these two types of lies affect relationships within social groups, Dunbar and a team of researchers associated with the Aalto University School of Science, in Finland, created a complex mathematical model, report LiveScience.

The model showed that those who tell anti-social lies become slowly isolated from others within their social networks.

However, people who tell pro-social lies don't become isolated from their groups. In fact, they tend to form stronger links with others in their social networks.

While the researchers created a purely hypothetical model, Dunbar said it could be used to understand how lying affects groups of friends and peers in the real world.

Researchers speculated that the model 
could also help psychologists better understand the effects of lying in 
online communities, where much of today's social networking takes place.

Social networks that people create 
online - on sites such as Facebook and Twitter - mimic the social 
networks they're part of in the real world.

So, fibbing on Facebook, 
much like telling a white lie to a friend over lunch, might actually 
improve your relationships, according to the new model.

Larry Rosen, a psychology professor at California State University, Dominguez Hills, told LiveScience he finds the Facebook Like button most fascinating.

He said that in general, people like things on Facebook because of something he calls 'virtual empathy.'

Whether you're liking a picture of your 
aunt's cat or a status update from a childhood friend, pressing the Like
 button tells a person that you have good intentions or that you support
 them in some way, Rosen said.

The Like button can function as a type of lie

However, not all likes are delivered with such good intentions. Sometimes people might click the Like button just because they feel it's something they're supposed to do.

For these people, pressing the Like button functions as a type of lie.

'I think that in many cases you can consider the like a white lie if [it's done] for reasons that have nothing to do with support,' he said.

Liking something on Facebook that you don't actually like resembles giving a dishonest answer to a question such as 'Do you like my new shoes?'.

In these situations, you might say something insincere, but only because you're worried that honesty might hurt someone's feelings.

And while it can calm your nerves to lie, it could also save your friendship.
