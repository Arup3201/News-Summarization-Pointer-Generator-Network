George Groves threw today the latest negotiating blow in the skirmishing before Saturday’s Wembley Stadium mega-fight with Carl Froch by objecting to a second referee.

But this time his appeal has failed.

Groves lodged a protest against the appointment of Charlie Fitch, who was the replacement for another American.

Froch’s promoter Eddie Hearn had already turned down David Reiss in the on-going saga of the officials.

It was always doubtful whether Groves could  succeed in ousting Fitch.

The British Boxing Board of Control require all referees, be they domestic
 or foreign, to undergo stringent medical tests before officiating in 
this country.

With Groves 
having insisted on the entire panel of the referee and three judges 
coming from overseas, it was always likely to be too late for a new man to 
fly here in time to be cleared.

Groves,
 concerned that Fitch’s preference for a free-flowing fight might 
benefit Froch, still thought it worth a try – but the IBF have declared 
that their referee will be the third man standing.

Hearn
 says now: ‘No more drama with the officials. Fitch is the referee and 
the judges are in place. But in a big fight like this all possible 
advantages get exploited. No doubt there will be more mind games.’

The
 complaints saga began with Groves successfully demanding that the IBF 
mandate this world super-middleweight title re-match after he was 
controversially stopped in the first fight.

Then came his protest against home officials.

After
 the exclusion of Reiss, London’s Saint George vetoed one of the judges 
on the grounds that he is Polish, home-land of Froch’s parents.

Then he wanted Fitch removed.

Even though that has not happened, Groves will not refuse to fight.

Were
 he to do so the promotional losses, given the logistical problems of 
getting Wembley ready for boxing less than 24 hours after England’s 
World Cup footballers play Peru there could well result in costly legal 
actions.

Rejected: Froch's promoter Eddie Hearn has already turned down David Reiss as a possible official for the fight

Hearn made it clear that neither he nor Froch would have opposed any new referee if one could have been installed in time.

He said: ‘Carl couldn’t care less who is the third man in the ring. Boris Johnson can referee the fight if he wants.’

One
 apparent advantage for Froch has been secured by the staging of 
Friday’s weigh-in at 4 pm, giving the naturally heavier Groves less time
 to regain weight than if it had gone ahead at lunchtime.
