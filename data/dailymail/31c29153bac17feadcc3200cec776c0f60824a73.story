Southampton have completed a double swoop for Belgium international Toby Alderweireld and Red Bull Salzburg winger Sadio Mane.

Both flew in for medicals on deadline day as Ronald Koeman moved to beat Newcastle and Sunderland for Alderweireld after the defender agreed a loan move, and Tottenham for Senegal striker Mane, who completed an £11.8million switch. 

Alderweireld joins from Atletico Madrid with the option for a permanent move, which would cost Soyuthampton £6.3m. Mane arrives on a four-year deal. 

'I’m very happy to be here,' said Alderweireld who played for Atletico in last season's Champions League final defeat against rivals Real Madrid.

Move: Southampton have agreed a loan deal with Atletico Madrid for Belgium international Toby Alderweireld

'I had a good talk with the coach. First of all, it was very important for me to play this season and the coach gave me a good solution for that.

'The trainer likes how I play and really wanted me to come here, which is what convinced me to come. I really wanted a trainer that believes in me, because that’s important.

'I think this is an upcoming club. Southampton put a lot of effort in to get me, so now I want to give something back to the club by doing my best to help the team. I want to give everything for Southampton.'

Alderweireld has 37 caps for Holland and can play at centre-half or right-back. 

'I am delighted that we have been able to bring Toby to the club,' boss Koemanadded.

'I know him very well because he played for some years for Ajax in Holland and he then made a transfer to Atletico Madrid, where he hasn’t been playing an awful lot, which is why he was looking for somewhere else to play.

'I think our first conversation was four or five days ago and I told him about our plans, about the ambition of the club and about how we play. He is a strong defender, and is also very good at building up the play when we play out from the back.'

Southampton also formally terminated Algeria international midfielder Saphir Taider's season-long loan move from Inter Milan after less than a month. He has joined Sassuolo.

Koeman said:'He experienced a difficult situation here. I cannot guarantee that all the players here will play. There are so many competitions to deal with, and so many good players and it must be up to the player to prove they deserve space.

'If you do not accept this thing, then everything becomes more difficult.'
