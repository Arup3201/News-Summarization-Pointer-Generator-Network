Police bail is to be capped at 28 days to end the 'scandal' of people languishing in a legal limbo.

Ministers will today set out plans to reform the law which means there is currently no restriction on the amount of time that police can keep someone on pre-charge bail.

Lawyers and campaigners have warned that innocent people are being waiting for years before seeing their cases being dropped or thrown out of court.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has led demands for a change in the law in Cabinet talks.

The Home Office will today set out two options for reform, both of which will mean a magistrate having to approve bail of more than three months and a judge in a Crown Court having to agree to it being extended beyond a year.

There is a coalition split over how to reform shorter bail periods, however. Conservative ministers are understood to be arguing that after a police inspector puts someone on bail up to 28 days, a chief superintendent should then be able to extend it to three months.

Liberal Democrats, however, say the power to keep people on bail beyond 28 days should be removed from police altogether and a magistrate should have to sign off an extension to a period up to three months.

Pre-charge bail was introduced in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which gave police the power to put someone who has been arrested under bail while they gather additional evidence.

Before the change, people suspected of crimes had to be held in prison while officers investigated allegations against them.

However, there is no time limit on pre-charge bail as the law stands – meaning police can roll it on for months or even years while they determine whether they can gather enough evidence to persuade prosecutors to bring charges.

Civil liberty campaigners say the law has increasingly been abused, leaving people in limbo for months and undermining the principle that they are 'innocent until proven guilty'.

People caught up in long-running police bail can lose their careers and have the fear of potential charges hanging over them with no known decision date.

Of around 70,000 people are currently on pre-charge bail in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, more than 5,000 are thought to have been on bail for more than six months.

The issue has gained prominence because of a number of high-profile cases including that of DJ Paul Gambaccini, who was held on pre-charge bail for 12 months over alleged historical sex offences before being told that there was no basis for further action.

Some journalists accused of phone hacking, meanwhile, have been left on police bail for more than two years.

Senior Tories have backed the calls for a change in the law, including Damian Green, a former Home Office minister, David Davis, the former shadow home secretary, and Sir Edward Garnier, the former solicitor general.

They signed a campaign letter earlier this month which warned: 'Innocent people have been left on pre-charge bail for years before their cases have been dropped or thrown out of court.

'This is a scandal. Those on it have their careers put on hold. The mental anguish of not knowing what will happen to them is in itself a form of punishment without trial: The weight of suspicion grows heavier with each day.

'All these individuals are innocent until proven guilty. It is a fundamental axiom that justice delayed is justice denied.'

The Home Office will today announce a consultation on bringing in a 28-day cap on the amount of time someone can be held on police bail without approval from the authorities, a Government source said.

'There is going to be a statutory limit,' the source added. 'There are going to be two models: either a chief superintendent or a magistrate will have to sign off bail up to three months, and then a magistrate will have to be persuaded of the case up to 12 months and a Crown Court judge beyond that.

'There may have to be exemptions for complex fraud cases, tax evasion or historical sex abuse cases which can take a long time to investigate.

'But it can't be right that people are spending months and years waiting to find out they are never going to be charged.'

Law Society president Andrew Caplen said people are often left 'in the wilderness' while police decide whether they should be charged with a crime.

'The Law Society has been calling for a statutory limit on length of time the police are able to keep suspects on bail, often with conditions, before they are charged with a criminal offence,' he said.

'Not only does keeping someone on police bail interfere with their liberty; it also means that police investigations can be protracted and slow, making the justice system less efficient and with a negative effect on complainants and witnesses. We support there being a statutory limit of 28 days, after which the police should apply to a magistrate for an extension where this can be shown to be necessary.'
