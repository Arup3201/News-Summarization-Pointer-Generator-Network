A Pennsylvania man who sought refuge from his burning home in a nearby bar was arrested allegedly telling fellow patrons he killed his wife.

Firefighters responding to the Friday night blaze found Lynn Wright’s charred body in the ground floor bathroom of the Williamsport home she shared with husband Michael Wright. People at the bar thought he was joking until cops showed up.

Mr Wright, 53, has been charged with criminal homicide for the death of his 50-year-old wife, officials said.

'I killed my wife': Michael Wright confessed to a bar and police that he murdered wife Lynn Wright

At 10:30pm – just before firefighters arrived and as him home burned to the ground – Mr Wright walked into nearby Ann’s Tavern and allegedly told the bar he killed his wife, according to reports.

A regular who came in two or three times a week, according to a bartender who spoke to MailOnline, no one believed him when he first told what had happened.

He often took beer to go, and would sometimes turn up with his wife. There were no signs of trouble, they never argued in public, said the bartender, who declined to be named.

‘He was telling my friends… we all though he was bulls***ing,’ she said, adding that she even bought him a drink.

‘He just acted normal, like nothing had happened,’ the bartender alleged.

‘Flames were shooting probably 10, 20 feet over top that roof,’ witness Maynard Honler told WNEP.

Despite the raging fire, Mr Wright kept his tab open.

About half an hour later, his sister showed up and told him to leave because his house was on fire.

‘You need to go now, your house is on fire,’ the bartender said the sister pleaded, he did not want to leave. A bouncer eventually forced him to go.
