Goals from David Goodwillie and substitute Cammy Smith took Aberdeen to the top of the Premiership table on Thursday night — now the real challenge is for Derek McInnes’ men to stay there for as long as possible.

They certainly have the opportunity to remain at the league summit for a lot longer than seemed apparent just hours before the kick-off at Pittodrie on Thursday.

As Celtic’s early evening meeting with Partick Thistle fell foul of the stormy weather in Glasgow, a northern ray of light emerged for the Dons to safeguard their lead over Ronny Deila’s side.

On this form, there is no reason why Aberdeen cannot maintain what many will consider an unlikely challenge to the defending champions as they simply dominated St Johnstone virtually from start to finish yesterday.

It is now eight league wins in their past nine games and six victories in a row without even conceding a goal, their best run in 23 years and surely the sort of form a credible threat is built on.

This is now the latest stage of any season that Aberdeen have been top of the table since May 1991, when Alex Smith’s side led Rangers going into a fateful final day.

A draw at Ibrox would have been enough to bring the league trophy back to Pittodrie but they suffered a crushing 2-0 defeat and the rest is history.

How McInnes and the current generation of the club’s supporters would love to take it all the way to the last day of this campaign.

However, even then, you get the feeling that the Dons manager would still be carefully claiming that the title was Celtic’s to lose, given his naturally pragmatic approach to the situation.

In the build-up to this match, McInnes tried his best to dampen any excitement over Aberdeen’s prospects of mounting a serious title challenge this season.

The news filtering through from Glasgow that Celtic’s players would be enjoying a holiday like most other people didn’t help that quest.

All of a sudden, the prospect changed from the possibility of a few hours as league leaders to one that could conceivably stretch deep into the month and beyond.

Celtic’s trip to Gran Canaria in mid-January means even a win at Kilmarnock on Monday would now leave them a point behind Aberdeen, should the Pittodrie men pick up another victory at Motherwell on Sunday.

The Dons players were left under even closer scrutiny yesterday in front of a large, expectant crowd, who were looking to see if they could cope with the pressure that the scenario presented.

Early indications were that they emphatically could and many of the reasons why were evident as a St Johnstone side, on a similar good run of form, were more than competently dealt with.

The home side played with pace, penetration and a movement that the visitors struggled to come to terms with, particularly during a blistering opening phase.

The Perth club came into the game on a six-match winning streak and were undefeated in their last eight league games since losing at home to Kilmarnock in mid-October.

Not that they were allowed to settle into any sort of attacking rhythm in front of a healthy home crowd as they were hemmed in their own half for lengthy spells during the opening 45 minutes.

It had taken just six of those minutes for their highly-motivated hosts to edge in front, with a sublime piece of skill from Goodwillie required to get the better of Alan Mannus.

The striker’s chest trap from Niall McGinn’s cross brought the ball under control and an extravagant overhead kick sent it soaring into the net, with the aid of a slight deflection.

That was Goodwillie’s first goal since October but he should have increased that tally just a few minutes later in the aftermath of Chris Millar’s caution for pulling back Jonny Hayes.

The midfielder took the resulting free-kick, picking out an unmarked Goodwillie, who guided his header wastefully wide of the target from 12 yards.

For the rest of the half, Aberdeen found Mannus a frustratingly difficult barrier to their ambitions as the Northern Ireland international produced a series of impressive saves to keep the deficit down.

Peter Pawlett and McGinn, in particular, had reason to curse the athleticism of a goalkeeper who somehow blocked their netbound efforts as St Johnstone struggled to repel attacks down their left flank.

Brian Easton’s absence meant Dave Mackay switching to left-back, where he looked far less comfortable than usual, something which was emphasised when Millar had a go at him midway through the half.

Of much more concern for the visitors was the way that the Aberdeen players kept finding the space to fire attempts at their goal, where Mannus continued to excel.

The best of several important saves came in 33 minutes when the elusive Hayes let fly from distance only to see the Saints goalkeeper once again make an impressive diving parry.

Goodwillie did manage to beat Mannus from the edge of the area with a neat spin and shot but that also just beat the far post on its way past, while Pawlett handled before putting the ball into the net.

That offence was well spotted by referee Craig Thomson as his assistant on that side was no help at all, but the fragility of a one-goal lead was made clear in the last action before the break.

Wright’s side won a corner that Aberdeen did not defend with any great authority, only for home goalkeeper Scott Brown to extend his unbeaten record by blocking Steven Anderson’s overhead kick.

It was a warning that clearly registered as, if anything, the Dons played with an even greater intensity at the start of the second half, with the visitors’ goal continuing to lead a charmed life.

Quite how it took Aberdeen until stoppage time to finally confirm their victory must be the only concern for their manager, given the chances scorned.

Ash Taylor, who was resolute in defence to the extent that he was given the sponsor’s man of the match award, twice headed over the bar from close range when picked out from corners.

McGinn had a fresh-air swipe at the ball when any contact would have brought a goal for the hosts and Adam Rooney will not want to watch his even more embarrassing miss.

Pawlett raced clear to the right touchline before putting a cross to the back post which Rooney, on the stretch, astonishingly sent soaring over the crossbar from point-blank range.

It was left to substitute Smith to finally confirm the inevitable when Rooney turned provider, evading the offside trap as St Johnstone pressed for an unlikely leveller.

His cross found the unmarked Smith, who was assured enough to steer his shot beyond Mannus, who was helpless for once.
