This is the devastating moment a heavily pregnant zebra was killed by hyenas in Africa.

It was a scene that photographer Marc Mol found incredibly difficult to watch – other onlookers couldn’t bear it and left, he said

The harrowing scene unfolded in Kenya’s Maasai Mara National Reserve in Narok County, with the mare set upon by 20 hyenas.

Heart-breaking: The heavily pregnant zebra is simply unable to get away as the hyenas attack

Savage: The hyenas attacked in huge numbers - but the zebra looked defiant at times

Brutal: The hyenas gather around the zebra's rear, with some soaked in blood

Surrounded: The zebra doesn't stand a chance against so many of the predators but she still tries to stand up

The zebra looked on in a stoic and defiant manner as the animals attacked.

Wildlife photographer Mr Mol revealed that the zebra’s misery lasted for 20 minutes.

Mr Mol said: ‘It was one of the most remarkable events I've ever seen.

Merciless: The hyenas attacked in a frenzy, with one pictured here almost completely covered in blood

Helpless: The zebra doesn't have the strength to escape

Instinct: The hyenas quickly sense that the zebra won't be able to get away

Vicious: More and more hyenas become covered in blood as the attack goes on

Numb: The zebra didn't make a sound as the attack took place, probably as it was in shock, according to photographer Marc Mol

‘My wife and I observed this predation by a pack of hyenas on this poor and unfortunate Zebra mare who was heavily pregnant and simply couldn't keep up with the herd.

‘It was the first time my guide of 15 years and I had ever witnessed something like this.

‘Subsequently the unborn foal was savagely ripped out and carried off by one of the hyenas.

The end is close: These pictures were taken shortly before the zebra died, with the hyenas tearing flesh off her

Final heartbreaking moment: A hyena carries the mare's unborn foal away

‘It was absolutely heart-breaking to watch, simply too much for one person in another vehicle next to us and they left after this happened.

‘Throughout the attack, the mare didn't utter a sound as the savagery of the pack set in, no doubt in severe shock.

‘It was not an easy event to photograph and document as I witnessed two lives being taken, but this is after all the struggle for survival in the circle of life.’

Mr Mol also revealed that one hyena made off with the unborn foal and a black-backed jackal stole some of its kill.
