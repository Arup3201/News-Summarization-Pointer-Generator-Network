Manchester City are ready to offer Yaya Toure a role as a club ambassador when he retires from playing.

The Ivory Coast midfielder has two-and-a-half years left on his deal but City are open to extending his contract, which is worth £220,000 a week, and are set to tempt him with a prestigious job behind the scenes.

At the age of 31, this is likely to be Toure’s final big-money contract.

But Financial Fair Play rules are an issue and City would be reluctant to offer him a pay increase. Instead, they are exploring other incentives, with an ambassadorial role or even a coaching position being talked about.

It is a far cry from last summer when Toure threatened to leave after being angered that the club did not acknowledge his birthday sufficiently.

But while it seems Toure could end his career in Manchester, defender Bacary Sagna is growing agitated at his bit-part role and may consider his future at the end of the season.

Roma coach Rudi Garcia is understood to be monitoring the 32-year-old’s situation with a view to a summer switch.

Sagna signed a three-year deal upon arriving from Arsenal on a free transfer last summer.

Bacary Sagna has failed to hold down a first-team place and is growing frustrated at his bit-part role

The France defender has started just 12 games for Manchester City so far this season

But he has made only 12 starts while failing to dislodge Pablo Zabaleta as the club’s first-choice right back.

That lack of action is frustrating the France defender, who was a regular at the Emirates.

Sources close to the player say he is keen to help City challenge for the Premier League and Champions League.

But if his first-team chances don’t improve, Sagna may look elsewhere for regular football.

City, however, are in a position of strength as Sagna will have two years left on his contract this summer.

Meanwhile, New York City head coach Jason Kreis has refused to dwell on the furore surrounding Frank Lampard’s delayed move from City. He said: ‘This means some other guys are going to get meaningful opportunities in his position. We’re going to have a player who’s at the top of his game to give us a boost in the middle of the season.’
