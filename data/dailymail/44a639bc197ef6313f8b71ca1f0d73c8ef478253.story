Jason Puncheon's clinical finish after an excellent run from substitute Wilfried Zaha gave Crystal Palace a huge three points from Tottenham in their first Premier League match under Alan Pardew.

After a scoreless first half, Harry Kane's dream run continued with a 49th-minute gem as the towering striker got the ball out of his feet and fired into the bottom corner.

However, a penalty drilled home by Dwight Gayle after 69 minutes and Puncheon's strike on 80 minutes gave Pardew a sensational win.

Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel was at Selhurst Park and assesses the players' performances.

Scott Dann showed why he'll be a key man for Alan Pardew at Crystal Palace on Saturday for a score of 8.5
