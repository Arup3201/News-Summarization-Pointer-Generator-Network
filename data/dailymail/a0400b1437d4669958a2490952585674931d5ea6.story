Parliament is set to be recalled on Friday for MPs to vote on launching air strikes on Islamic State fanatics in northern Iraq.

David Cameron is today holding talks in New York with his Iraqi counterpart Haider al-Abadi, who is expected to make a formal request for help.

MPs are expected to be summoned for an emergency session debate in the Commons on Friday morning to approve the action, with British Tornado bombers in action by the weekend.

Interviewed on NBC News, Mr Cameron said the IS group posed a direct threat to Britain. 

'These people want to kill us,' he said. They've got us in their sights and we have to put together this coalition … to make sure that we ultimately destroy this evil organisation.'

The move comes amid growing Tory criticism of Britain's cautious response to the threat posed by IS, which has murdered three Western hostages and is threatening to kill kidnapped British taxi driver Alan Henning.

Mr Henning's brother-in-law Colin Livesey last night appealed for air strikes to be called off, arguing that the raids would reduce the chance of him being released alive.

But Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Britain had to take the fight to the extremists – and suggested bombing raids should be extended to IS strongholds in Syria.

Mr Fallon told the Spectator magazine: 'We've had attacks on the streets of London, on our transport system, at Glasgow Airport, the murder of Lee Rigby – how much more evidence do you need that this is a very clear and dangerous threat to our way of life and to all the democracies of the West.

'This is a new Battle of Britain.

'Iraq is under attack not just from terrorists inside its own borders but from terrorists in the north of Syria.

'If Syria continues to be unwilling or unable to deal with IS then at least the question arises as to whether we shouldn't assist Iraq in doing so.'

Downing Street remains nervous about Labour's stance on the issue after Ed Miliband yesterday called for a UN resolution sanctioning military action against IS. 

A British source pointed out there had already been two resolutions condemning IS – with a third expected today on the issue of foreign jihadis.

But the source said there was no prospect of a resolution on military action because of Russian opposition.

However, today Mr Miliband insisted his party was 'open to the possibility' of UK forces joining air strikes in Iraq but would not commit in advance of seeing detailed proposals.

He said he would 'look very seriously' at any proposal to meet a request from Iraq for British involvement, but action in Syria was a 'more complex' question.

'Isil is a threat that can't be turned away from,' he told BBC Breakfast.

'We've said that we need an alliance which is not just a military alliance but a political and diplomatic alliance.

'How will I judge any proposal? Whether Britain can have an effect, whether we can succeed and whether it is legitimate and lawful. But I am open to the possibility.'

He said he had not spoken to Mr Cameron about the issue or the potential recall of Parliament. 

Britain was caught flat-footed yesterday when the US carried out its first air strikes on IS positions in Syria, in conjunction with five Arab countries.

Downing Street is understood to have been given a 'courtesy call' by the Pentagon shortly beforehand.

But the UK was notably absent from a list of allies praised by Barack Obama yesterday for standing 'shoulder to shoulder' with the US.

Mr Cameron last night insisted Britain would play its part in the assault. Asked about the possibility of British bombing raids, he said: 'We're looking carefully at what role we can play in this coalition.

'We've already taken a number of steps so far. We've also armed the (Kurdish fighters). And we will keep looking at what more we can do.'

But Tory former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth said it was becoming a 'national embarrassment' that the UK was not taking part.

He insisted: 'We should be standing shoulder to shoulder with the US and our allies against this utterly brutal group, not sitting on the sidelines.'

Liam Fox, the former defence secretary and standard-bearer for the Tory right, said: 'We risk exacerbating the idea, first achieved by the Syria vote, that we have opted out of any leadership role in global affairs.'

Mr Cameron will today plead with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani for his support in the fight against IS.

It will be the first face-to-face talks for 35 years between the leaders of the two countries which have been at loggerheads over Tehran's nuclear policy.
