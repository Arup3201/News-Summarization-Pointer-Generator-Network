Warren Gatland has hit out at the RBS 6 Nations fixture scheduling and claimed that Wales and England have consistently been given a difficult opening round tie.

The Wales coach claims the draw in Dublin has played into the hands of Ireland over the last decade, with their Celtic rivals being given a favourable round one tie against Italy in seven of the last 14 competitions.

‘Who is doing it?’ said Gatland. ‘The last 15 years have been very tough on England and Wales in terms of the draw we have both received. Who is making that draw?

'You look at one team who has had a pretty easy run in the last 10 or 15 years and for the next two or three years. Whether that is the broadcasters having an influence, I don't know.

‘It’s a tough tournament to win: win your first game and you get a bit of momentum and put yourself in contention. I don’t know if there should be a rota: I don't make the draw. I have just looked at the last 10 or 15 years and seen who has played who first in the competition. Some teams have obviously had easier starts on a regular basis than others.’

A Six Nations spokesperson claimed the draw is made by an impartial vote, saying: ‘The fixtures are decided after discussions with the unions, the Six Nations office and the broadcasters. 

'The schedule is then voted on by the Six Nations council, which has two representatives from each union. Each union has a chance to make their thoughts known and then it comes down to a majority vote. The last vote was unanimous.’
