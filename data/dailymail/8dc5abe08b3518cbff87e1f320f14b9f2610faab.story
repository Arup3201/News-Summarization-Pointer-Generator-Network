A group of older women from the Ukrainian countryside who won a talent show in the country have been signed up to motivate their countrymen to fight if there is a Russian invasion.

In the new patriotic video posted on the internet the women, who admit they are no longer spring chickens, say they will nevertheless fight to save their country from Russian aggressors.

Ages of the group's members range from the youngest who is middle-aged to the oldest in her eighties, and they go by the name of the Cow Girls Battalion.

They released their song 'Come on you old Broads' in which they sing about their 'ample breasts' protecting 'Ukraine from any raid'.

The two minute 38 second video with English subtitles starts with rural scenes showing the OAPs working in fields and chopping wood.

Then, a granny dressed in a combat uniform and a helmet appears and whistles for the other grannies to join her, and they are then seen saying goodbye to their menfolk as they go off to fight.

The group are then marching with guns and pitchforks down a dirt track led by the group’s lead vocalist Natalia Falion, 58, playing an accordion.

The group, which won Ukraine’s Got Talent in 2013, are then seen training for battle as they sing 'Tomorrow we’ll go shooting tin cans around the town, we’ve formed our smart battalion , the old broads are comin’ down!'

They then burst into the chorus singing: 'Come on! Come on! Come on!  We’re – the Cowgirls’ hot Brigade! There’s millions more just like us.  Old broads on our crusade!'

On a surprise visit today to Crimea, Russia's prime minister promised to quickly pour funds into the newly annexed peninsula so residents see positive changes after the Russian takeover.

Dmitry Medvedev, who led a delegation of Cabinet ministers to Crimea, pledged that Russia will quickly boost salaries and pensions there and pour in resources to improve education, health care and local infrastructure. 

A special government ministry has been created to oversee Crimea's development.

Russia
 annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March after a hastily called referendum 
held just two weeks after Russian forces had overtaken the Black Sea 
region. Ukraine and the West have rejected the vote.

'People in Crimea mustn't lose anything after joining Russia, they must only make gains,' Medvedev said in televised remarks.

'People
 expect us to create conditions for calm and respectable life, 
confidence in tomorrow, the feeling of being part of a strong country. 
We must meet these expectations.'

Germany's influential finance 
minister says Russian President Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea 
employed tactics reminiscent of those used by Adolf Hitler to expand 
Germany's territory before World War II.

Wolfgang
 Schaeuble told a school group visiting his ministry Monday that Putin's
 contention Russian nationals were at risk in Crimea was like Hitler's 
claim ethnic Germans were being discriminated against in the Sudetenland
 region of Czechoslovakia before Germany annexed it in 1938, the dpa 
news agency reported.

'Hitler
 already took over the Sudetenland with such methods,' Schaeuble said at
 the public event, though he added that he was not comparing Russia to 
Nazi Germany.

Chancellor
 Angela Merkel refused to comment on the remarks, saying only that she 
saw the Russian annexation of Crimea as a 'violation of international 
law.'

The US and European Union imposed targeted sanctions on Russia after it annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine following the ouster of Ukraine's pro-Russian president by pro-EU protesters
