A bride who feared her big day would be ruined by building work outside her family home was gobsmacked when workmen provided a guard of honour using diggers and painted a message of congratulations on the road.

Hannah Kirk, 34, thought her special day would be spoiled by tram works taking place outside her parent's house in Beeston, Nottingham.

She was heartbroken that the tradition of travelling to the ceremony from her childhood home would not be fulfilled as the road had been closed for the last two weeks.

Serenade: The bridal party were greeted by machine operator Eddie O'Donnell playing the flute

Parents Ken, 65, and June, 74, had begged contractors Taylor Woodrow Alstom to suspend work so a car could reach their home on Saturday.

But the workmen dug deep to go one better and surprised Hannah on the morning of her special day with a send-off she would never forget.

She left the house to wed fiance James Jackson, 23, to find a red carpet flanked with flower pots and a JCB archway above her wedding car.

They had also permanently painted wedding bells and written 'congratulations' in road markings outside her front door.

Memorable send-off: Hannah had feared getting ready for her wedding at her childhood home would not be possible thanks to the tram works but they ended up enhancing her day

Tram worker Eddie O'Donnell was also on hand wearing his high-vis clothing to serenade the wedding party with a tune on a traditional Irish flute.

Yesterday delighted Hannah said: 'I had absolutely no idea, it was just amazing. I was overwhelmed and overjoyed.

'It is wonderful the effort everyone has gone to, I felt like a princess, it was a great start to a great day. I've always wanted to go from my parents' house and I was worried I couldn't do. I'm so pleased, I'm so happy - I can't believe it.'

Hannah and James first met five and a half years ago and had been planning their wedding at Colwick Hall, a Grade II listed manor house in Nottingham, for nearly a year.

Father-of-the-bride Ken added: 'We're glad we made it happen. She looked absolutely beautiful, I am so proud of her.

Here comes the bride: Hannah was able to travel to her wedding venue from her parent's house thanks to the Taylor Woodrow Alstom workers

'I had an inkling they were spraying something onto the street but I had no idea about the flute player or the diggers, it was certainly something different.'

Tram worker Eddie said: 'The song I played is called One to One and it was written by my friend for his own wedding day, so it is a very special song.'

Machine operator Duncan Collison, 36, added: 'I came down an helped set the diggers up this morning.

'I've never seen anything like it before. It's going to be a bit surreal going back to the day job now.'

Mark Freeman, foreman from Taylor Woodrow Alstom, said: 'It was her day and we tried to alleviate any impact the work had on it.

'We did a bit of reinstatement work and put a message out there for her.'
