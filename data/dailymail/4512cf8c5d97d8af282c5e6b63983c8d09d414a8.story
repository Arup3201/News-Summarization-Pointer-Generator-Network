A trip to pick a Year 12 formal dress ended in tragedy when 16-year-old Emily Payne was killed in a car accident last Sunday.

After spending the weekend dress shopping in Brisbane, Emily was a passenger in a silver sedan, driven by her cousin.

The pair were on their way home to Roma, in south west Queensland when the car lost control and collided with a tree off a gravel road outside Chinchilla at about midday, near a relative's home on Cameby Rd.

Her cousin was able to call for help, but Emily died at the scene, leaving the both girl's families heartbroken and the Roma community shell-shocked, reported The Courier Mail.

With her funeral to be held on Tuesday, Emily leaves behind a twin sister Abby, brother Sam, parents Judy and Rodney Payne and boyfriend Jack Moller.

Abby Payne said she was reeling at the sudden loss and that her twin was an outgoing, happy and independent person.

'We did everything together. I was the older twin by seven minutes but Emily was always the one looking out for me. She will always be remembered for her extremely loud laugh and her outgoing personality,' Abby said.

Emily was due to finish her last year of high school this year at Roma State College and her sister said there were many things she was going to miss doing together, such as working at a cafe, going to the gym and cooking.

A tribute will be held at Roma State College on Monday to coincide with the return of school term, principal Anthony Green confirmed, describing her as a young woman who 'had it all'.

Emily's cousin was taken Chinchilla Hospital with injuries resulting from the accident, including fractured legs and and abdominal and was later flown by helicopter to a Brisbane hospital, reported the Warwick Daily News.
