The last time I saw this sort of media hullabaloo in honour of a new baby, I was standing outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington. Today, we are actually here to glimpse four new arrivals — three little boys and a girl. But they are all related, since they all share the same father.

And as far as the world of racing is concerned, they have a pedigree every bit as regal as young Prince George.

For this lot represent the first crop of progeny from arguably the greatest racehorse in history — Frankel, the stallion who never lost a race. 

And they're off: The first Frankel foal to be sold, this colt by Crystal Gaze, changed hands for £1.15million at a sale at Kensington Palace in June. It was bought by Ireland's Coolmore Stud

And this week, the racing industry has been enjoying a good gawp as four of his ‘Frankelfoals’ have been the star attractions at the Newmarket stables of Tattersalls, the famous equestrian auctioneers.

It is now two years since the British-born bay superhorse thundered across the finish at Ascot to claim a record-breaking 14th victory (out of 14 races) in front of his terminally-ill trainer, the late Sir Henry Cecil. It was as emotional a day as most racing veterans can remember.

Since then, Frankel has settled in to a new life at Banstead Manor stud farm outside Newmarket, where breeders and their mares are queuing up for his procreational services at £125,000-a-time. And now the first results have been on display.

Newly-weaned and accompanied by a personal groom and 24-hour security, these foals are on their first trip away from mother and home. It’s already a test of character.

Even to an untrained eye like mine, there is something rather majestic about the lively and surprisingly furry son-of-Frankel being led around in circles in front of a couple of propsective buyers. 

I hardly know my fetlock from my withers, but even I can still discern that this particular creature has a certain confidence and poise — almost haughtiness — which many of the gawky young things on sale here do not possess.

No doubt this vivacious creature is a ghastly show-off in the thoroughbred playground — ‘My Dad’s won more races than all your Mums and Dads, so ner-ner-nee-ner-ner . . .’ — but that is precisely the sort of quality owners are looking for.

Tattersalls draws a big crowd every year for its foal sale, when over 1,000 untested thoroughbred infants change hands for astonishing sums of money. As Tatersalls director Jimmy George explains, the average price paid for a foal at last year’s four-day sale was just under £45,000.

Today, the chief talking point in the bars and stable blocks has been Frankel’s offspring. Will they turn out to be a chip off the old block — or just genetic hype?

Since his first foal was born in January, he has sired more than 100 colts and fillies. Most of these will remain under lock and key until they make their debut on a racecourse in 2016 (horses cannot race until they are two).

But there are always a few breeders who want to see a return on their investment sooner rather than later. So they want to sell now. It might be a wise move.

These creatures carry no guarantee of racing prowess. One of the greatest racehorses of the last century, Brigadier Gerard, spent years on stud duty and sired one disappointment after another.

Nature has a similar policy with the human race. Pele might have been the greatest international footballer of his age. But the Brazilian maestro’s son, Edinho, had an undistinguished career in domestic football before things really went downhill. Six months ago, he received a 33-year prison sentence for laundering drug money.

So, until the first crop of Frankel’s offspring have run a few races, his talent as a stud remains unproven. But many people have still come to Tattersalls trying to look for tell-tale signs in the four foals which are here.

The first one I see is a perky chestnut filly being led around under the watchful eye of Matt Gilsenan, farm manager for Norelands Stud in Ireland. The farm has two of Frankel’s offspring up for sale here, this filly and a bay colt. Neither has a name because you don’t name a horse until it enters training.

A potential buyer in a flat cap appears and whispers that he’d like to have a peek at the colt. The stable door opens and out comes a feisty bay (dark brown) specimen, a dead ringer for Dad. The would-be buyer nods enigmatically and leaves.

These auctions are a very congenial affair — Newmarket’s hotels and bars have been full for days — but the jargon, like the thumping great catalogue, is impenetrable.

To compound the confusion, every transaction is conducted in guineas. Newmarket folk still regard the pound as a rather vulgar denomination. Don’t get them started on the euro.

Mishap: The Cheveley Park colt had to leave the sale

Matt Gilsenan has lost count of the number of people asking to see his ‘Frankels’. ‘I think the colt alone has done 90 shows today,’ he says. Surely, I suggest, a lot of people are just time-wasters? ‘Maybe,’ he says with a smile. ‘But you never know who they are or who they might be buying for.’

You can make no assumptions about anyone here. It’s raining, it’s muddy and most people are in wet-weather gear. A lady in a green anorak and old boots turns out to be Kirsten Rausing, expert breeder, scion of the Tetrapak family, and one of the wealthiest women in the world.

Seeking out another mini-Frankel, I meet top agent, Tom Goff of Blandford Bloodstock. It’s like going wine-tasting with a claret guru. ‘Fantastic mover,’ mutters Tom as Lot Number 1103 — a bay Frankel colt by the American dam, Swiss Lake — is led out of his box for our perusal.

‘That’s a horse that covers plenty of ground . . . good reach in front . . . great bone . . . very correct . . . a kind eye . . . great demeanour . . . an honest head . . . ’

This particular colt is being sold (or, in racing jargon, ‘consigned’) by the New England Stud. ‘He’s a stand-out horse with a great presence,’ says manager, Peter Stanley, himself from illustrious racing stock.

His elder brother, Teddy Stanley, is the Earl of Derby and it was their ancestor who lent his name to the most famous race in the world.

In another yard, I find the fourth Frankel foal, a chestnut colt out of the British dam, Red Bloom, herself a winner of six races and £436,000.

‘He’s got a good attitude,’ explains Chris Richardson, managing director of Cheveley Park Stud, ‘and he’s got a long ear. I do like a long ear.’

Stud hand Matthew Crick, whose job is to look after this colt day and night, adds: ‘He’s the boss in his paddock.’

What’s it like nannying such a valuable bit of horseflesh?

‘Quite nerve-racking,’ Matthew admits. It’s always a tricky business with hyperactive toddlers like this. And so it proves soon afterwards when this colt bangs a leg on the side of his box. It’s not serious or even unusual, but he still has to be withdrawn from the sale.

The market is still all over the place when it comes to valuing these creatures. This summer, the first Frankel foal to go on sale, a colt owned by a branch of the Qatari royal family, fetched a cool £1.15 million. ‘I’d rather we hadn’t sold him but we have another 11 Frankel foals at home,’ says their racing adviser, David Redvers of Tweenhills Stud. ‘And there are two of those that I wouldn’t swap for any other horse alive.’

Only last week, another Frankel foal, a filly, broke the Irish record when she was sold at auction for £1.4 million. Yet, two others were withdrawn from the same sale when they failed to reach their reserve prices. In their case, the market simply wasn’t convinced that the price was right.

Last night, the remaining Tattersalls three finally came under the hammer, but all failed to reach their reserve prices (which were not disclosed). The highest bid was £367,500 for Peter Stanley’s ‘stand-out’ colt.

Despite the anti-climax, the general view is that most of these foals will return to the auction ring in 2015 as yearlings (which tend to attract higher prices anyway). As for future foals, prices will soar if this first crop does well in competition — as will Frankel’s own worth. And he’s already valued at more than £100 million.

But here in Newmarket, I can’t help feeling a little sorry for the Frankel brood. They may be more pampered than the only child of an oligarch, but the attention is remorseless, the pressure is already on and they are only eight months old.

There will, surely, come a moment when they look out across their manicured paddock and think: ‘I wish was a Shetland pony.’
