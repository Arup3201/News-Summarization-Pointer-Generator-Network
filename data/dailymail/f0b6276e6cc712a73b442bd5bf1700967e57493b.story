Tragic: Chevonea Kendall-Bryan fell to her death at her Battersea home in March 2011

The death of a bullied teenager who fell 60ft from her bedroom window was witnessed by one of her schoolboy tormentors, an inquest heard today.

The boy, known as E6, started crying and said, 'That wasn't meant to happen', when he saw Chevonea Kendall-Bryan plummet to her death, according to a witness.

He then cycled off without going for help, but later returned and watched paramedics try unsuccessfully to revive the 13-year-old.

Chevonea had been repeatedly bullied by a group of boys - but teachers accused her of bullying them in turn, and made her sign a complex 'anti-bullying contract'.

Hours before her death in March 2011, she discovered that a video of her being forced to perform sex act on E6 had been circulated among her classmates.

During Chevonea's inquest at the Westminster Coroner's Court, neighbour Richard Umunegbu described how he was walking to the shops near his Battersea home when he saw the girl fall from a window in a block of flats.

'There was a boy on a push bike going in the same direction,' he said. 'He was about three metres away from me talking on the phone but I didn’t really hear what he was saying.'

Mr Umunegbu continued: 'I heard a loud bang - it came from the flat I was walking past.

'The bang came from the block. I didn’t know what it was at first - my first reaction was to look away to the right.

'I looked back to the left and the boy on the phone spoke to me. He started to cry and said, "Did you see that?" He was kind of shocked.'

He added: 'I saw the girl on the floor and the body wasn’t moving. The boy on the bike was too much in shock.'

According to Mr Umunegbu, the boy - whom he later identified as E6 - cycled away but soon returned with a friend, and watched as paramedics tried to save Chevonea's life.

'One little thing I remember him saying was that he was like, "This wasn’t meant to happen,"' the neighbour said.

When coroner Bernard Richmond asked how sure he was that E6 had said this, he replied: '100 per cent.'

Chevonea suffered devastating brain injuries after falling from her bedroom window, and was declared dead later that evening.

It also emerged today that the schoolgirl had been made to sign an anti-bullying agreement along with six teenage boys from her school who had tormented her.

E6, who attended a different school and cannot be named for legal reasons, did not sign the agreement.

Zach Darlington, a child protection teacher at St Cecilia's School in Wandsworth, told the inquest that the pupils had been made to appear before him to work out their differences.

'If you accept there are incidents where the boys are the aggressors, you have to consider the occasions when Chevonea is the aggressor,' he said.

‘I know there’s more than one of the boys and I know she is female, but I have to consider if there are occasions where her actions towards them can be considered in the same way.'

But Mr Richmond suggested that the language used in the contract was overly complex for the Year 9 schoolgirl.

'Chevonea was below average academically,' the coroner said. 'Her language was poor. You are making her sign something that is an anti-bullying contract, making her sign something that says she is bullying the boys.'

'The contract should be in plain English. Did it not occur to you to say before signing on the dotted line, do you understand what you are signing up for?'

But Mr Darlington replied: 'I believe that they fully understood the behaviour that was expected of them.'

Chevonea was bullied by classmates from the age of 11, and the abuse became worse after she accused a 15-year-old of raping her at a party.

E6 allegedly forced her to repeat the sex act on him, and the incident was filmed by a friend who sent it to other pupils at their school.

Chevonea posted a series of morbid messages on her Blackberry Messenger account on the evening of her death, saying, ‘F*** this life’ and telling a friend ‘he wants me to jump’.

The teenager had a history of self-harm, and had tried to take a handful of paracetamol pills during a class, the inquest has been told.

The hearing continues.
