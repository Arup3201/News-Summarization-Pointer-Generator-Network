Santiago Vergini's own goal set the tone for Sunderland's day at St Mary's.

It was the first slither of humiliation on a day that Gus Poyet will  want to sweep under the rug as Southampton won 8-0 against a club that traveled 653.4 miles to be torn apart.

Vergini's strike into the bottom-right corner of his own net and disastrous defending thereafter saw the 26-year-old receive one-and-a-half out of 10 in Sportsmail's ratings.

Luckily for the man on loan from Estudiantes, he's not alone. Vincent Kompany,  Peter Enckelman and more have all been there as Sportsmail dig out the best own goals of all time.

Vincent Kompany (Manchester City vs Fulham, 2013)

Kompany uncharacteristically sliced a clearance which looped over helpless goalkeeper Joe Hart.

It struck the post - as did Jesus Navas while trying to prevent the own goal - and Kompany was left red-faced by the gaffe that brought Fulham level at Craven Cottage.

Not to worry, though, as City went on to win the game 4-2 and eventually the Premier League title.

Jeff Hopkins (Crystal Palace vs Millwall, 1989)

Lobbing the goalkeeper from 25 yards is usually something you'd be telling your grandchildren about for years. Unfortunately for Hopkins, this clip has stood the test of time just as well.

With a back-pass the only option left for Hopkins, the Wales international accidentally plays a deft volley perfectly over Perry Suckling. Palace won the game 4-3 over their London rivals.

Frank Sinclair (Middlesbrough vs Leicester, 2002)

It may not surprise you that Sinclair makes our list of greatest own goals and arguably his best came against Middlesbrough, although the cameraman wasn't expecting it.

Sinclair tells it best when asked which own goal he was most embarrassed about.

The now 42-year-old manager of Colwyn Bay says: 'Probably the one against Middlesbrough. Ian Walker was Leicester's goalkeeper and I tried to hit a backpass from about 35 yards.

'But I slipped and it went in. That was the most painful one because we ended up going down that year.'

Tony Popovic (Portsmouth vs Crystal Palace, 2004)

Crystal Palace were eventually relegated by a single point on the last day of the season in 2004-05, and Popovic's own goal against Portsmouth at Fratton Park didn't help matters.

Trailing 2-1 in a rain-soaked Portsmouth, the Australian defender  put the game out of reach with a majestic flick into the back of his own net. 

A pupil of Gianfranco Zola, Popovic somehow got the ball into the top corner from a cross and it went down as one of the 'most beautiful' goals of all time.

Lauren (Manchester City vs Arsenal, 2003)

Their invincible season had it all. Goals, glamour and glitz on their way to Premier League title glory.

This own goal by Lauren, however, was a momentary lapse during an otherwise flawless season.

Under pressure from Trevor Sinclair's blistering pace, the defender takes a touch 30 yards from goal towards goalkeeper Jen Lehmann, and slots it beyond the German to make it 1-0. Arsenal won 2-1. 

Lauren's own goal against Manchester City in 2003 was a bump in the road during their incredible season

Lee Dixon (Arsenal vs Coventry, 1991)

Safety first. That's the defender's mantra, but Dixon regrets opting for a back-pass this time.

Dixon, with the ball 30 yards from goal, decides to loft it back to David Seaman with too much venom and it sails over the England international.

Gary Lineker and Co on Match of the Day made it their regular go-to clip whenever Dixon featured.

Peter Enckelman (Birmingham vs Aston Villa, 2002)

Did he touch the ball? That's the big question. Either way, it goes down as one of the most bizarre own goals of all time by Aston Villa goalkeeper Enckelman.

Birmingham met their bitter rivals Villa for the first time in a decade, and nobody expected a 3-0 win for the club who were so often in the shadow of the other.

Olof Mellberg's throw-in to Enckelman went under the goalkeeper's foot and into the net. As if that wasn't bad enough, a few fans took to the pitch to boast, too. 

Chris Brass (Darlington vs Bury, 2006)

A straight-forward clearance proved anything but for Brass.

With the ball bouncing, the former York manager swiped to clear the ball from behind, only to have it cannon off his face and into the back of his own net.

Kasper Schmeichel in goal could do nothing. Bury came back to win 3-2 but Brass's nose - and ego - took a severe beating that day.

Djimi Traore (Burnley vs Liverpool, 2005)

He didn't often score winners during his seven-year spell at Liverpool, and Traore is mainly remembered for this own goal against Burnley.

Anyone who tries to replicate a Zinedine Zidane drag-back in the six-yard box runs the risk of being punished, and Traore learned that the hard way in 2005.

Liverpool lost 1-0 at Championship side Burnley and were knocked out of the FA Cup.

Wayne Hatswell (Forest Green vs Morecambe, 2000)

All Hatswell had to do was coolly clear the danger. Instead, he found the top-right corner.

You're forgiven if you hadn't heard of the Forest Green defender before, but this FA Cup blunder helped cement Hatswell's place in own goal history. 

Seemingly under no pressure, Hatswell tries to swipe the ball to safety but slices it into his own net.
