Repented: Gary Carl Simmons was said to apologize for the grisly murder he committed in 1996

Mississippi executed a grocery store butcher on Wednesday who was found guilty of using his meat carving knives to dismember a man and then scattering the body parts in an alligator-infested bayou in 1996.

Gary Carl Simmons, 49, received a lethal injection at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman and was pronounced dead at 6.16pm, corrections spokesman Adam Lee said.

Simmons requested a massive last meal that would have fed a dozen people.

The Mississippi blog GulfLive reported that in full he asked for one Pizza Hut medium Super Supreme Deep Dish pizza, double portion, with mushrooms, onions, jalapeno peppers, and pepperoni; pizza, regular portion, with three cheeses, olives, bell pepper, tomato, garlic and Italian sausage; 10 8-oz. packs of Parmesan cheese; 10 8-oz. packs of ranch dressing; one family size back of Doritos nacho cheese flavor; 8 oz. jalapeno nacho cheese; 4 oz. sliced jalapenos; 2 large strawberry shakes; two 20-oz. cherry Cokes; one super-size order of McDonald's fries with extra ketchup and mayonnaise; and two pints of strawberry ice cream.

It is not clear if he ate it all, but that last meal would come in at almost 30,000 calories.

Ninety minutes before his execution, at a 4:45 press conference, the Department of Corrections claimed he had eaten about half his mean, sampled everything but the chips, and was still eating.

Simmons epic last meal request included multiple pizzas, a family sized back of Nacho flavored Doritos, two bottles of Cherry Coke, a super size McDonald's fries, ten large packets of ranch dressing, five pounds of Parmesan cheese, two pints of strawberry ice cream and more

Simmons was the 22nd person executed in 
the United States this year and the third inmate put to death in 
Mississippi this month, according to the Death Penalty Information 
Center.

For his last words, while strapped to 
the gurney, Simmons, said 'I’ve been blessed to be loved by some good 
people, by some amazing people. I thank them for their support. Now, 
let’s get it on so these people can go home. That’s it.'

The procedure became and he was pronounced dead at 6:16 pm..

Mississippi now has executed six inmates 
in 2012, already the highest number carried out by the state in a single
 year since 1956, when there were eight executions.

Simmons was convicted of the August 1996 murder of 21-year-old Jeffery Wolfe. According to records from the Mississippi Supreme Court, Wolfe and his girlfriend drove from Houston to Mississippi to collect a drug debt of between $12,000 and $20,000.

But when they got to Simmons' house, Simmons and his accomplice, Timothy Milano, told Wolfe they did not have the drugs or the money, records showed. An argument erupted, and Milano fatally shot Wolfe with a .22-caliber rifle, records showed.

Simmons then hog-tied and locked Wolfe's girlfriend in a foot locker, removing her later to rape her and 'telling her that her life depended on how well she performed sexually,' the court document said.

Afterward, Simmons put the woman back inside the box and went into the bathroom, where he dismembered and gutted Wolfe's body in the bathtub using knives he had sharpened at work, the records showed.

Simmons and Milano scattered the victim's remains in a bayou behind Simmons' property, according to documents. Wolfe's girlfriend managed to escape from the foot locker and ran to a neighbor's house to call police, records showed.

Simmons was sentenced to death after being convicted in August 1997 of kidnapping, rape and capital murder. Milano was sentenced to life in prison.

Simmons 'said he made peace with God and that he was remorseful,' Mississippi Department of Corrections Commissioner Chris Epps said at a news conference ahead of the execution.

Gary Carl Simmons ate pizza, parmesan cheese, ranch dressing, chips, jalapeno nacho cheese and peppers, strawberry milkshakes, cherry soda, french fries and strawberry ice cream for his last meal.

Here are a few other notable final dinners:

John Wayne Gacey, who murdered 33 teenage boys and young men in Illinois the 1970s, asked for 12 fried shrimp, a bucket of original recipe KFC, french fries and a pound of fresh strawberries.

Lawrence Russel Brewer, a white supremacist convicted of killing a black man by dragging him behind his truck in Texas in 1998, ordered two chicken-fried steaks, a triple bacon cheeseburger, a cheese omelet, a large bowl of fried okra, three fajitas, one pound of barbeque with half a loaf of white bread, a Meat Lovers pizza, three root beers, one pint of Blue Bell vanilla ice cream and a slab of peanut butter fudge with crushed peanuts.

He refused to eat any of it when it arrived before his execution in September 2011. As a result, Texas corrections officials no longer serve condemned inmates last meals.

Robert Dale Conklin, who used a screwdriver to kill his gay lover then dissected his body in 1984 in Georgia, received filet mignon wrapped with bacon, de-veined shrimp sautéed in garlic butter with lemon, baked potato with butter, sour cream, chives and real bacon bits, corn on the cob, asparagus with hollandaise sauce, French bread with butter, goat cheese, cantaloupe, apple pie, vanilla bean ice cream and iced tea. 

Victor Feguer, who kidnapped and murdered an Iowa doctor in 1960, asked for a single olive, with the pit still in it, served on a large plate with a fork and knife. After he was hanged, the pit was found in his suit pocket.
