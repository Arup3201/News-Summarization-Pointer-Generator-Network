The casinos like to call it The Grand Arrival when the protagonists for the big fights they are hosting come to town.

Manny Pacquiao more than lived up to that description as he flew into Macau from the Philippines aboard one of the two passenger jets he hired to bring more than 350 of his nearest and dearest to his fight here this weekend.

By contrast the challenger for his world welterweight title, Chris Algieri, took a scheduled flight from his Los Angeles training camp in the company of his six-man team.

Manny Pacquiao trains in the Philippines ahead of his world welterweight bout with USA's Chris Algieri

Pacquiao will bank at least 25 million dollars for the fight, then a minimum of another 100 million dollars if he wins and gets his eagerly-awaited bout against Floyd Mayweather

At least the New York-based Argentinian travelled half-way round the world in business class.

Pacquiao’s journey from home took a mere 90 minutes and his entourage form the advance guard of more than 5,000 of his countrymen who will help pack the 15,000-seat Cotai Arena here.

They include trainers, sparring partners, business advisors, allies in his political career, assistants at his pro basketball club, family, friends and poor Filipinos to whom he Is giving an outing.

This is a generous superstar. Generous to a fault say some who worry about the rate at which he spends money.

But he will bank at least another 25 milllion dollars for this fight – then a minimum of another 100 million assuming he wins and Floyd Mayweather takes the mega-bucks bait for the Fight of the Century. Hopefully this century. Preferably next year.

Algieri, a pleasant young man, accepts his role in the shadow of the PacMan without resentment, working hard to do what he can to promote the event as well as himself.

His fast-rising career has overtaken his studies but if he can amass a more modest fortune quickly he intends returning to medical college.

There was bedlam as they both made their entrance to the Venetian Hotel and Casino, along with China’s national boxing hero Zou Shiming.

While the thousands of Chinese pouring into Macau are fascinated by Pacquiao, they are loudly patriotic about Shiming.

Algieri enjoys a spin-off from all the attention, as will all the undercard fighters.

Pacquiao revels in the spotlight and appreciates the knowledge and enthusiasm of the Chinese public.

This is his second appearance in the Cotai Arenas and he says: ‘The biggest difference between fighting in Las Vegas and fighting in Macau is that virtually all the fans are in their seats before the first bout begins. They really love their boxing here.’

So much so that they will be in those seats by 8am on Sunday morning, local time.
