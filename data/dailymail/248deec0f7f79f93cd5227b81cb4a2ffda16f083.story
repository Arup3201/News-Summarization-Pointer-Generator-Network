Sad death: Pensioner Rita Phelps died after falling out of her hospital bed and suffering a fatal head injury at Southampton General Hospital

An elderly cancer patient died when she fell out of a hospital bed after staff failed to raise one of her bedside safety rails, an inquest heard.

Rita Phelps, 74, suffered a fatal head injury when she fell to the floor during the night in an intensive care unit.

Staff at Southampton General Hospital had failed to raise one of her bedside safety rails which would have acted as a barrier to protect her.

As a result, Mrs Phelps rolled out of her bed, hit her head and died just hours later following a bleed on her brain.

Her
 two daughters attended the inquest at Southampton Coroner’s Court and 
said their mother, would 'still be alive' if the nurse had 'raised the bed 
rail'.

Gordon Denson, deputy coroner for Southampton and the New Forest, told the inquest her 'sad and untimely' death was preventable.

He said: 'I am, to say the least, concerned that the level of care expected was below the standard required.

'Such a fundamental error should never have occurred.'

At the inquest, a family statement said other NHS staff had 
originally misdiagnosed her illness as osteoporosis and a chest 
infection.

Mrs
 Phelps, a retired widow, then moved from Hythe in Hampshire to Hove, East Sussex, where 
doctors found she was suffering from a type of blood cancer called 
multiple myeloma.

She made good progress and moved to Totton near Southampton, Hampshire.

But last year she noticed a pea-sized lump on her head was growing rapidly and was told her cancer had returned.

She was rushed to Southampton General Hospital and transferred to the intensive care unit.

Last year on June 20, her family received a telephone call at 5am from staff saying their mother had fallen out of her bed during the night.

A family statement said: 'Staff apologised and said it should never have happened.

'We asked if the sides of the bed were up and we were told no one could remember.'

Coroner Mr Denson then read a statement from staff nurse Camilla Fox, who said the rails on the right-hand side of the bed were down.

Ms Fox said: 'I heard a noise and found the patient on the floor. I shouted for help and supported her on the floor.

'I asked her questions, which she answered clearly and coherently.'

But she added that Mrs Phelps started to look pale and became clammy.

The pensioner suffered a bleed on the brain, which was inoperable, and died just hours later.

Hospital staff said an investigation was launched into the incident and steps had been taken to prevent any similar tragedies in the future.

The coroner said Mrs Phelps died as a result of injuries she received in the fall and recorded a verdict of accidental death.

Juliet 
Pearce, patient safety manager at the University Hospital Southampton 
NHS Foundation Trust released a statement after the inquest.

She
 said: 'We hope the information shared with family members both in 
hospital and at the inquest demonstrates the Trust’s regret and concern 
about this incident.

'We are also committed to minimise the risk of falls.

'We
 will continue to provide Mrs Phelps’ family with our support and will 
keep them informed of the improvements made to systems to prevent other 
families suffering the loss of a loved one under similar circumstances.'

After the hearing, her daughters Jan Oriel of Hove, East Sussex, and Teresa Harris, of Totton, Hampshire, claimed their mother had been failed by the NHS.

Mrs Oriel said: 'If a nurse had raised the bed she would still be alive today. She did not have a chance to fight the cancer because that chance was taken away.'
