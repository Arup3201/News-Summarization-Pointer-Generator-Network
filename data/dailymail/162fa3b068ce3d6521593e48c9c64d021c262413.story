Roger Waters’ live tour has outsold Bruce Springsteen and Madonna to become the top-selling live act in 2012 so far.

The former Pink Floyd singer-songwriter's The Last Few Bricks tour in America and Canada has sold more than 1.4 million tickets globally – that’s $158.1 million – according to Pollstar Magazine which monitors the live concert business.

Bruce Springsteen’s Wrecking Ball tour, which started in March, came in a distant second making $79.9 million in ticket sales, and Madonna’s world tour came in third totaling $42 million so far.

Best seller: Roger Waters' live tour which included a show in Charlotte, North Carolina (pictured) has made $158.1 million in ticket sales this year ahead of big names like Bruce Springsteen and Madonna

Might be toppled: Pollstar Magazine doesn't think Waters' (pictured performing in Raleigh, North Carolina) time at the top will last long with Springsteen and Madonna still with plenty of concerts to come

In tough times for concert promoters, ticket prices have dropped by an average of $6.34 to $60.68 – the lowest price since 2007 in what Pollstar called ‘today’s economic realities’.

Lady Gaga, Coldplay, Madonna and Paul McCartney have also been on the road this year and have helped push ticket sales for the 100 largest American concerts up 1.2 per cent, selling a record 18.6 million tickets to the tune of $1.1 billion.

Working hard: Springsteen (pictured left performing in Berlin, Germany) and Madonna (pictured right performing in Italy) have sold $79.9 million and $42 million in tickets respectively

Smash hit: Waters wrote the hit 1979 Pink Floyd album The Wall which was adapted into a feature film by the same name

But Waters’ time at the top could be short lived according to Pollstar.

The
magazine wrote: ‘While Waters still has a few walls left to build on 
his itinerary, Springsteen also has a long way to go before the end of 
the Wrecking Ball tour, and still could finish with the year's top 
outing.

‘Madonna has yet to hit North America (and) also has an outside shot.’

Waters,
68, who sang and played bass for Pink Floyd, wrote the hit 1979 album 
The Wall which charts the decline and fall of a rock star so emotionally
scarred by the loss of his father during the war that he retreats ever 
further behind a psychological barrier.

The album was used as the soundtrack to a film of the same name directed by Alan Parker in 1982, which included unforgettable animations of artwork by Gerald Scarfe, and starred Bob Geldof as the angst-ridden rock star Pink, a clear stand-in for Roger Waters.
