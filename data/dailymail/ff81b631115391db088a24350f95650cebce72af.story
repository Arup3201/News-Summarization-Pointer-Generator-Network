With her mane of long blonde hair, winsome smile and passing resemblance to Jennifer Aniston, she may not exactly be a dead ringer for her famous grandfather.

But as she looks forward to sharing the stage with Sir Bruce Forsyth at the Royal Albert Hall to celebrate his 70 years in showbiz, it is clear Sophie Purdie has inherited the entertainer’s famous drive and singing talent.

And the 20-year-old beauty lifted the lid on the secrets of Sir Brucie’s longevity after joining ‘granddad’ for a duet on his latest album.

Miss Purdie told the Mail that Sir 
Bruce - who began his showbusiness career in 1942 aged 14 - remains a 
perfectionist at the age of 83.

She revealed: 'I think he must have some OCD [Obsessive Compulsive Disorder] or something about wanting to get things right.

'He’s always worrying about stuff and wanting to get it right – and I think I get that from him as well.

'I think that goes in his favour. I like to be slightly organised – but I’m not as bad as him.

'I don’t think he is [OCD] at home. 
That’s his relaxation period. He’s very like that at work – but not when
he’s at home. There, he likes to be relaxed.'

Younger days: Sophie with her grandfather Sir Bruce

Married three times, Strictly Come 
Dancing host Sir Bruce has six children, nine grandchildren and an 
ever-expanding brood of great-grandchildren.

Miss Purdie’s mother, Julie Forsyth, 
is no stranger to showbusiness herself. She was in the 1970s pop group 
Guys ‘N’ Dolls who appeared regularly on Top of the Pops.

Julie is one of three daughters Sir Bruce had with his first wife Penny Calvet, who is also a singer.

After Penny, Sir Bruce married his 
Generation Game hostess Anthea Redfearn. Twenty-eight years ago, he then
wed former Miss World Wilnelia Merced, whom Miss Purdie calls 'an 
absolute saint….amazing,’ adding: ‘she’s kept us altogether really.'

Despite the wealth of talent in the family, Sir Bruce was stunned to discover his granddaughter’s voice.

Miss Purdie said: ‘It must have been a
couple of years ago that I was getting demos together and my voice was 
starting to mature a bit.

‘Then we were round his house and we 
put it on and he couldn’t believe how mature I had got. He just 
remembered me as a little kid singing. And he thought: "Oh, blimey. She 
can sing".'

Nevertheless, Miss Purdie never 
imagined Sir Bruce would ask her to duet on his new album, These Are My 
Favourites. The pair sing together on the Charlie Chaplin favourite, 
Smile.

She admitted: 'I was walking down the 
road and he phoned me and asked me out of the blue. And I said: "Oh my 
God, of course I will." I couldn’t believe it.

'I was very honoured. I never thought it would happen. I never expected it at all.

'And I got a really good, really positive reaction. And that has given me a boost of confidence. He was lost for words…'

Now she’s looking forward to showcasing their duet for an audience at the Royal Albert Hall in May.

Miss Purdie also told how despite the 
passing of the years, Sir Bruce continues to lead the way for the family
when it comes to exercise.

Asked whether he continues to follow 
his renowned Tibetan exercise, she said: 'He does. He really does. He 
gets up so early. Whenever we stay around, we always get up later than 
him.

'He gets up at 6am every day and 
starts his exercises. Then he has some porridge in the morning. He’s 
already done so much stuff by the time we wake up.'

Miss Purdie grew up between Holland –
where her mother Julie and father Dominic Grant often worked – and 
England. She is, though, now settled in Ramsgate, Kent, and has been 
dating artist Matthew Penn for 18 months.

Miss Purdie started singing publicly when she was 16 when her father had a 'sore throat' and could not take to the stage.

'My parents have been singers in Holland so I did tour with them and that’s how I’ve sort of got into it really.

'My dad had a bad sore throat and they
needed to fill some time in. So I was backstage helping.and mum said: 
‘Quickly, help me. Get on.'

'So I rushed on stage and I suddenly 
realised I had the [showbusiness] bug. So, now I’m sucked in that’s 
really it for me. I really love it.'

Many have commented on Miss Purdie’s 
resemblance to Jennifer Aniston, but she said: ‘People keep saying this 
[Aniston] but I don’t see it. I guess it’s just the hair. But my 
favourite programme is Friends.’

Talking of her evergreen grandfather, she continued: ‘I completely forget that he’s 83 really. I just completely forget.

'To be honest I don’t see him as a famous celebrity because he is just granddad.

'I know that might sound strange but all the family just think of him as granddad really.

'I never would have thought he did what he did because he just seemed so normal.

'He is a very warm, homely granddad. He has had a massive role in my life.'
