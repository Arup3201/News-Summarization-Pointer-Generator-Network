Australian Patty Mills may be one of the biggest names in North America's National Basketball Association (NBA), but a reporter failed to recognise him as he photobombed a live AFL cross  - despite carrying the championship trophy.

Mills, 25, plays for the San Antonio Spurs and was joined by his  New Zealand-born Australian teammate Aron Baynes during the prank in Melbourne on Wednesday.

Fox Sports News reporter Julian de Stoop was in the middle of the live cross from outside AFL club Collingwood's headquarters when the two players jumped around him while carrying the Larry O'Brien Trophy - awarded to the NBA final winners.

On Wednesday morning the players crashed a live news cross out the front of AFL club Collingwood's headquarters in Melbourne, before being pushed away by reporter Julian de Stoop, pictured right

The ALF correspondent was not impressed by the intrusion, mistaking the two men for enthusiastic Collingwood fans.

De Stoop shook his head at the pair before telling them to 'get off boys' and pushing Mills, who had his arm in a sling, away from the camera.

After the cross a colleague let De Stoop know on air exactly who the two 'fans' were, to which he said he was 'highly embarrassed'.

'I'll have to apologise to (Mills) down the track, I had no idea it was him. I just thought it was a couple of Collingwood nuffies doing there thing,' De Stoop said.

De Stoop added afterwards that the bright gold famous trophy should have been a giveaway but he was busy concentrating on the cross at the time.

Canberra-born Indigenous player Mills recently signed a three-year $12 million contract to stay with the Spurs and is recovery well from a shoulder surgery.

Baynes, 27, took to Twitter following the prank to make light of the situation. '#Lazza @Patty_Mills and I just dropped in to a live @FOXSportsNews broadcast...anyone catch it?' he posted.

The Spurs won the NBA finals against Miami Heat and were in Melbourne as part of the trophy's world tour.

Next they head to Sydney Thursday and Canberra on Friday, where Mills will be given the keys to the city, reported the Sydney Morning Herald.

Then they travel to Brisbane before heading to Cairns, where Baynes grew up, and finish at Thursday Island, fitting with Mills' Torres Strait background.
