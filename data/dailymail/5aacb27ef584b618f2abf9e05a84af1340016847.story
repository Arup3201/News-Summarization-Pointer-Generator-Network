Rumors have long claimed it to be haunted, and it is one of the most-photographed houses in the U.S., consistently booked for fashion shoots and features for the likes of Vogue, Elle, W and New York Magazine. 

Now the Staten Island mansion once owned by Gustav A. Mayer — the 19th century inventor who sold his sugar cookie recipe to Nabisco for their 'Nilla' wafers  - has been listed for sale at $2.3 million.

Mayer, who died in 1918, left the home to his two daughters, Paula and Emilie, who never married and both lived until they were over 100-years-old, refusing to leave two certain rooms of the 10-bedroom house.

In this regard, the manor has become ideal for photoshoots, providing a setting that is rustic and dilapidated but also trapped-in-time, with many of the rooms untouched for decades.

Haunted?: Gustav Manor in Staten Island is, according to local folklore, still inhabited by the spirits of former owner, inventor Gustav A. Mayer, and his daughters, all of whom died in the mansion 

Historic: The 10-bedroom manor measures at 7,700-square-foot and has been listed for $2.3 million

However legend has it the spirits of Gustav and his two daughters continue to roam the halls.

The house, built in 1855, was put up for sale in June for $1.79 million.

However the listing was then removed.

It has now reappeared for $2.3 million, according to Top Ten Real Estate Deals.

However a $520,000 allowance for exterior restoration and another $50,000 for interior refurbishment is being offered to the buyer, bringing the final price to $1.74 million.

After buying the house from original owner David R. Ryers in the 1890s, Mayer transformed the 7,700-square-foot home so that it allowed him to live and workshop his inventions.

Besides his famous cookie recipe, he also made many successful molds for the likes of Vienna Roll, Cigaretta, Carlsbad, Fancy Dessert and Virginia Sugar.

Fashion focus: The home has been the setting for countless fashion shoots over the years

Mayer is also said to have developed 'a birch beer, patented a room humidifier and marketed a system of pre-formed letters for use on store signs. He also designed and manufactured sparkling reflectors for use as Christmas tree ornaments,' according to The Staten Island Advocate.

The sale however is likely to put an end to the myriad of fashion shoots the house and its gardens have witnessed over the last few years.

The Fault In Our Stars actor Ansel Elgort shot a high fashion feature on the grounds for Elle magazine, sitting in a tree out back with a model.

Mary Kate Olsen has  appeared in a Bohemian-themed shoot there for Harper's Bazaar.

Amber Heard has also shot a profile for V magazine inside the house.

Ornate: The house was first built in 1855 and has many of its original features

Dilapidated: Because some parts of the manor are so outdated, the real estate is offering internal and external renovation allowances for the new owners

Classic: The house has a distinct Victorian look and feel, including hand-painted drawings on the walls

The proximity to Manhattan makes the site even more popular.

However that doesn't make it an easy place to work.

Photographer Tom Corbett, who shot a Hitchcock-inspire piece for Cosmopolitan called 'Dial F for Fashion', said he was scared to enter the house.

'When I first showed up, I almost didn’t go in,' Corbett told The New York Times.

“I thought I was in the wrong place, but it turned out to be this total gem.” 

The three-level house is located at 2475 Richmond Rd. in Staten Island.
