Sitting in the dentist’s waiting room, the receptionist called out brightly: ‘Mrs Hodgkinson?’ I was on my feet without hesitation, even though the word ‘Mrs’ was almost as painful as the dentist’s drill.

I haven’t been a Mrs for nearly 30 years and, truth to tell, I’m not really a Hodgkinson either. It is my former husband’s surname, not mine, but it’s far too late to change and revert to my original surname.

That is why I felt a pang of jealousy when I read in last week’s Mail that Jemima Khan is to become Jemima Goldsmith again.

She became a Khan in 1995 when she married Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan. Despite their divorce in 2004, until now she has remained a Khan.

Ostensibly, she is going back to her maiden roots because her former husband is considering remarrying, which means there would be two Mrs Imran Khans. But others have suggested Imran is unlikely to have been overjoyed to see the Khan name associated with louche comedian Russell Brand, whom Jemima dated recently.

When my husband and I split up in 1988, after 23 years together, I kept his name for practical reasons. During our married life, I had become reasonably well known as a writer and it seemed professional suicide to revert to my original name, Garrett, a name nobody recognised. The name had become, as we might say today, a kind of brand.

So, against my feminist principles, I had little choice but to stay with a surname that bore absolutely no relation to my status or lifestyle. I was, and would remain, a single woman stuck with a married name, even though I called myself Miss on official documents.

Jemima, of course, coming from such an illustrious family, will not have to reinvent herself anew with an unknown name, but will be able to pass seamlessly back from Khan to Goldsmith.

One has to wonder why she has stuck with Khan for so long. She says she originally kept it as her two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim, felt strongly about it, but that now they’re grown up they don’t seem to care.

When my sons Tom and Will were children, it made things neat and easy for us all to have the same surname, especially when travelling as a family.

Now they are middle-aged and well-known writers themselves, I can bask in a little reflected glory. But it would be more dignified now, I feel, for me to have a different identity.

There have been stories recently of women being stopped at airports because they have a different surname to their children and have had to explain at great length that they really are their mothers.

Border officials are, of course, worried about trafficking. But for many women these days, it is an unforeseen consequence of hanging on to your maiden name.

I thought, when I married in 1965 at the age of 21, that it was a legal requirement for women to take their husband’s surname. It was only much later I learned it was merely a custom and never enshrined in law.

But at the time, women who kept their own names were considered odd. Didn’t they want to be married?

When I married at a very young age, I had not chalked up any achievements whatsoever, and so it seemed I had nothing to lose by taking my husband’s name for all purposes. Little did I know I would bitterly regret not hanging onto my own name, at least professionally.

Nowadays it’s common for women to revert to their maiden names on divorce, shaking off the one associated with an ex.

Yet some, like Jemima and Cheryl Cole (nee Tweedy) hang onto their ex’s name for years. Cheryl stayed a Cole for four years after splitting from footballer Ashley, and only changed to Versini-Fernandez when she remarried earlier this year.

Among my divorced friends, every one has reverted to her maiden name or chosen another neutral surname. Even when they remarried, most of my friends did not take their new husband’s name.

Some boyfriends I have had since my divorce have said they feel awkward about me still being called Hodgkinson and would prefer to think of me as Liz Garrett, untainted by carrying a long-ago ex’s name.

And there could be an identity crisis if my ex decided to remarry. But I think I’m fairly safe there. Neville is 70 and took a lifelong vow of celibacy when he went to live in a spiritual retreat centre 20 years ago.

The prospect of a school reunion where I will be surrounded by people who knew me only as Liz Garrett got me thinking. I had a go at a signature I have not used for 50 years and it felt as if I was using an alias; as if that person is not me any more.

So, I have had to face up to it: Hodgkinson, not Garrett, will be engraved on my tombstone.

Jemima, sensibly, is changing her surname while she is still young enough to do so.
