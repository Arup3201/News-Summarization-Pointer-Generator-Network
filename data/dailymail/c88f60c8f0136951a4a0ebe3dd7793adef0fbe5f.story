Argentina has refused to attend talks over the future of the Falklands because British Foreign Secretary William Hague insisted islanders be present.

Hector Timerman, Argentina's foreign minister, sparked a diplomatic spat by rejecting the offer by the UK government to hold a meeting aimed at diffusing growing tensions over the sovereignty of the islands.

Islanders had planned a 'frank exchange of views' before the Argentine pulled out of the face-to-face showdown.

The United Nations regards the dispute over the islands which Argentina knows as the Malvinas as a bilateral issue between Buenos Aires and London, he said.

And he said he was sorry that Mr Hague ‘can't meet without the supervision of the colonists from the Malvinas’.

Mr Timerman invited Mr Hague to meet with him in Buenos Aires, where he said ‘my fellow foreign ministers can freely meet with whomever they wish without being pressured or having their presence conditioned on meetings that they haven't asked for and don't interest them’.

Argentine president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has in recent years strongly asserted her country's demands for the Falklands to come under its sovereignty despite the opposition of the islanders.

Earlier this month, she had an advert published in British newspapers claiming that Argentina had been stripped of the islands in ‘a blatant exercise of 19th century colonialism’.

Prime Minister David Cameron has repeatedly insisted the residents of the Falklands must decide their own future and a referendum on the islands' political status is to be held in March.

In a statement released before Mr Timerman turned down the meeting, the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands stressed that their representatives, Dick Sawle and Jan Cheek, would not be ‘negotiating any deal’.

‘Rather we are anticipating a full and frank exchange of views,’ the assembly said.

‘Indeed we look forward to giving Mr Timerman some very direct messages on the unacceptability of Argentina's actions against the Falkland Islands in recent years.

Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner recently published an advert in several national newspapers claiming the Falklands were 'forcibly stripped' from Argentina 180 years ago

‘We demand that our rights be respected, and that we be left in peace to choose our own future and to develop our country for our children and generations to come.

‘It is only right that he should hear this directly from us, as well as from Mr Hague.’

In its statement, the Falklands assembly cited Britain's opposition to ‘any negotiations over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands unless and until the Falkland Islanders so wish’.

‘The Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly believes that the result of the forthcoming referendum will demonstrate definitively that we do not. Should the issue of sovereignty be raised at the meeting, it will not be discussed,’ it said.

‘Members of the Legislative Assembly made it clear in their letter of 2012 to President Fernandez de Kirchner... that the Falkland Islands Government is willing to meet with the Government of Argentina in order to make our views clear, and to discuss matters of mutual interest including fisheries and communication.’

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ‘We are aware that Argentine foreign minister Hector Timerman is due in the UK next week, and have invited him to come to the Foreign Office to meet the Foreign Secretary and representatives of the UK Government and the Falkland Islands Government.’
