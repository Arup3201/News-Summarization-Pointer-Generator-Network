Cigarettes could be banned from being sold in packets of 10 in an EU bid to prevent children from starting to smoke.

The planned curbs, which would also hit menthol and 'slim' cigarettes, could outlaw the sale of more than half of all tobacco currently sold in Britain.

Tobacco giants have lashed out against the proposed legislation, claiming that it will deprive the Treasury of revenue as smokers turn to the black market.

Curbs: 10-packs and menthol cigarettes could be outlawed by new legislation being considered by the EU

The latest development in the EU's long-running battle against smoking is set to come in a European Parliament vote on September 10.

MEPs will vote on whether to outlaw the sales of 10-packs, flavoured and slim cigarettes, as well as smaller packets of loose-leaf tobacco.

If they approve the new rules, they could come into effect as early as 2016.

Currently 38 per cent of all cigarettes are sold in packs of 10, but there are concerns that the cheaper packets make it more likely that young people will start smoking.

Crackdown: The Government has jettisoned plans to introduce plain packaging with graphic photographs

Mothers and grandmothers are concerned that bright, colourful packaging makes tobacco appealing to children, according to a new poll.

The survey by Cancer Research UK found that four out of five women believe bright packaging is attractive to young people, with 85 per cent saying that children should not be exposed to tobacco marketing.

Campaigners are using the results to push the Government to introduce plain packaging for all cigarettes, a plan which was put on hold last month.

Under the plans, tobacco packs would all be the same colour and would carry a prominent, graphic warning about the dangers of smoking.

Today's survey of mothers and grandmothers of children under 18 found 92 per cent would be worried about their children if they became addicted to smoking.

Over 200,000 children take up smoking every year, with more girls smoking regularly than boys, figures show.

Alison Cox, Cancer Research UK's head of tobacco control, said: 'We're urging the Government to introduce plain, standardised packaging of tobacco, which, as well as being a popular move, would show that the Government cares more about the health of future generations than the profits of the tobacco industry.

'We'd like to see the Government protect children from the lure of sophisticated tobacco industry marketing and introduce plain, standardised packaging as a way to reduce the number of young people who take up smoking.'

Labour has accused the Coalition of 'caving in to big business' by delaying the introduction of plain packaging, but health minister Anna Soubry said she 'would never give in to pressure'.

Menthol and slim cigarettes are also thought to be more attractive to young people by disguising the taste of smoking.

Another proposal would mean that loose tobacco for roll-up cigarettes and pipes could only be sold in packs of 40g or more.

Currently, more than 90 per cent of loose tobacco comes in packs of 25g or 12.5g.

The EU is anxious to reduce the number of deaths caused by smoking, which currently stands at 700,000 per year across the continent.

However, large tobacco companies have warned that the legislation could have unintended consequences, costing the Treasury as much as Â£800million in lost revenue.

Japan Tobacco International, maker of Silk Cut and Benson & Hedges, suggested that the UK was 'sleepwalking' towards an unacceptably harsh crackdown.

Paul Williams, the firm's head of corporate affairs, said that the legislation was 'even more severe' than plans to impose plain packaging which were delayed last month.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage, one of Britain's most high-profile smokers, told the Daily Express: 'This is part of a wrong-headed drive that will penalise the legal pleasures of the least well-off.

'The net result will be an increase in sub-standard counterfeit and smuggled tobacco, which will have obvious negative health outcomes. Let alone a deliberate reduction in personal freedom - that is a matter of course from Brussels.'

Ronan Barry of British American Tobacco added: 'There's an enormous risk.

'Just take menthol - if almost a million smokers wake up one morning and they can no longer buy their preferred product in the shop, there's a massive opportunity there created for criminals and illegal traders to step in and meet the demand that the legal market can no longer supply.'
