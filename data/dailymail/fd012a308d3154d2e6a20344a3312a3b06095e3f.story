Channel Tunnel services have returned to normal after operators repaired around half a mile of overhead power lines in the tunnel.

Passengers have endured two days of delays and cancellations after the overhead problem led to the breakdown of a French-bound shuttle train at around 7.30am yesterday.

This led to evacuation of nearly 400 passengers, plus four dogs, who were taken on to France by another shuttle train via the service tunnel.

Services through the Channel Tunnel have returned to normal after overhead power lines were repaired

Eurostar had to cancel services yesterday and were warning of knock-on delays earlier today

The 
tunnel’s high-speed train company Eurostar had to cancel trains 
today and yesterday while there were delays to some shuttle services on 
both days.

Services are returning to normal this afternoon following repairs which Eurotunnel said have taken around 24 hours.

The
 broken-down shuttle was driven from the site by a diesel locomotive and
 brought to the platform in France, where customers were reunited with 
their vehicles to continue their onward journeys.

Eurotunnel director Yves Szrama said: 'We apologise to our 
customers for any disruption that the events yesterday may have caused. 
The safety of the passengers is always our first concern.

'Once
 that is assured, we want them to be comfortable, well informed and well
 looked after. The recent installation of mobile telephone services 
inside the tunnel helped us keep our customers informed during the 
incident'.

Earlier
 today, four of the high-speed Eurostar train services to the continent 
had to be cancelled and there were long delays reported on Folkestone to
 Calais shuttle services.

After long queues at the Eurotunnel terminal yesterday (pictured), passengers reported delays again today

Many passengers took to Twitter to complain about the four delays to getting on a shuttle train

The delays were made worse by cyclists and their teams crossing the channel for the Tour de France

Eurostar said passengers who had a 
booking on a cancelled train could exchange their ticket, free of 
charge, for another available service within the next four months.

Meanwhile, thousands of people on domestic services were late for work today because of a rail track defect, just 24 hours after Network Rail was fined for missing punctuality targets.

Packed trains into Waterloo station in London were delayed because of the problem at Surbiton in Surrey. South West Train station services from Surrey were among those disrupted.

There were also delays to CrossCountry and London Midland services in the West Midlands due to a broken-down train.

It came after 382 passengers were forced to walk down a service tunnel after their train broke down

The incident blocked one of the channel tunnel's two tracks yesterday, throwing travel plans into chaos

The Channel Tunnel is about 40 metres below the sea bed, has two main tunnels and a central service tunnel connected to both. The south tunnel goes from France to the UK and the north from the UK to France

The south tunnel takes trains from France to the UK and the north tunnel from the UK to France.

A smaller service tunnel runs between them and is connected to both at 375 metre intervals.

This allows access for maintenance and emergency services and also serves as a safe haven if 
passengers need to be evacuated from their train in an incident.

In order to deal with blockages, the two main tunnels are each split into three 'intervals'.

These
 are designed in a way which means that if a train breaks down inside, 
services can still run through the length of the tunnel.

The tunnel's interval system allows trains to pass through even when one tunnel is blocked

This
 is possible because the Channel Tunnel has two undersea crossovers 
allowing trains to pass from one tunnel to the other to avoid and 
isolate a section of tunnel that is blocked.

Yesterday, almost 400 people were walked from interval two in the north tunnel 
into the service tunnel and then into a train waiting in interval one in
 the the south tunnel.

The
 train then used a crossover to take it back into interval four and then
 along the correct tunnel that nearly always takes services to France.

Trains from France to Britain have been taking the same route for ninety
 minutes but are then forced to wait as trains from Britain to 
France do the same, causing the delays.
