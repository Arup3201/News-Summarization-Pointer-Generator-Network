Jack Colback hopes to prove his worth as the best free transfer of the summer after he controversially swapped Sunderland for North-East rivals Newcastle.

‘I’ll let other people judge that but I’ll be doing my best to perform every week and let’s hope I turn out to be,’ he said.

The 24-year-old Geordie believes there is plenty of scope for improvement at his boyhood club.

‘I know in myself I can improve my game. This is the next step in my career and I have come here to be successful.

‘There might be a bit more pressure — the fact I’ve come from Sunderland — and I’ve got to try to turn the fans’ heads at Newcastle and win them over. But it’s something I’m relishing.’

The midfielder claims the decision was easy once he had been sold Alan Pardew’s vision.

‘I live in Newcastle so most of the people I have seen have been Newcastle fans and they have just wished me all the best. The support so far has been brilliant. Newcastle is a huge club and it was a massive opportunity for me to come here.

‘I have come to play for my hometown club, the club my family has supported and I have supported — that was the biggest thing. It’s a club looking to go places. I met the gaffer and he was a big factor in me coming here. I was really impressed and excited about what he said and where he wanted to take the club.

‘We’ve got to be looking at a minimum top-10 finish and then push on to get around the Tottenhams and Evertons and be able to compete against the top four or five teams, not just going out looking not to lose.

‘The signings the manager has brought in — coupled with the players already here — will give us the chance to do that I think and it’s looking good.’

Easy decision: Colback was convinced that the move would be a good one by Alan Pardew this summer

Meanwhile Hatem Ben Arfa will be used as a makeweight in Newcastle’s attempt to sign Lyon’s Alexandre Lacazette.

The Magpies have been pursuing the 23-year-old striker all summer but have so far failed to reach an agreement, while there has also been a suggestion the player wants Champions League football.

But sources in France say Lacazette could be open to a move.

Ben Arfa, 27, is training with the reserves after Pardew criticised his ‘professionalism’ and it is thought there is no possibility of a reprieve.

Newcastle would have to pay a portion of his £50,000-a-week wages should he join Lyon on loan, while a fee of around £15m has been quoted for Lacazette, who scored 23 goals last season.
