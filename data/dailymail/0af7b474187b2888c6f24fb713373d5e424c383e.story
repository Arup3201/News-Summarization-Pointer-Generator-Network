William Shatner may have mastered futuristic technology as Captain Kirk but he's less than happy about Facebook's new app for celebrities, called Mentions.

The app, released last week, would force Shatner to follow other celebrity accounts.

'The first person on the list I
 was given was George Takei (rolling my eyes.),' the Star Trek actor wrote on his Tumblr,

In a recent blog, actor William Shatner called Facebook's new app for celebrities, called Mentions, 'ill conceived'

Shatner recently criticized Twitter for allowing 'nobodies' to get verified accounts

The former co-starts have famously feuded over the years, and as The Huffington Post noted Takei called Shatner 'very self-centered' only a week ago on 'Real Time With Bill Maher.'

Shatner continued: 'I ended up choosing Robert Downey Jr. to follow and then I hid his 
posts (sorry Robert!)  I think that is a big flaw in the set up.  If 
this app is for celebrities then WHY force them to 
follow another celebrity in order to set up this app?  I think that is a
 flaw; I’m already following those who I want to follow - why insist I 
follow that short list of others?'

Shatner would prefer it if Mentions allowed him to access his page's photos, settings, and events, and that more features from the Pages app were available for Mentions.

Shatner declined to follow former co-star George Takei, who has called the Captain Kirk actor 'very self-centered'

He summed up the experience as 'ill conceived.'

This isn't the first time Shatner's opened fire on tech he didn't like.

In June he called out John Colucci, who works in social media for Engadget, criticizing Colucci having a verified account on Twitter because he wasn't important enough.

The 83-year-old Shatner knows his way around the web and especially social media, keeping an active presence on both Facebook and Twitter.
