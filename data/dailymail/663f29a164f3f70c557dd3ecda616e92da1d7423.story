Madonna yesterday called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to release 30 Greenpeace crew members jailed after a protest against oil exploitation in the Arctic. 

The singer said in a message to Greenpeace: ‘These people are in prison for staging a peaceful protest. Let’s bring them home.’

The so-called Arctic 30 are held in St Petersburg on hooliganism charges carrying a maximum  seven-year sentence after being moved from a bleak detention centre above the Arctic Circle.

Meanwhile, Greenpeace protesters yesterday gathered at petrol stations across the UK to plead for the release of the Arctic 30.

The environmental group targeted Shell outlets following reports the firm is to join with Russian oil giant Gazprom in drilling in the Arctic.

Prime Minister David Cameron last week urged President Putin to treat the Arctic 30 fairly.
