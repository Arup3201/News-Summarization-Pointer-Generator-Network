Whitney Thompson was the first ever plus-size winner in the history of America’s Next Top Model and has since launched a plus-size dating site, worked with Rihanna and fronted hundreds of campaigns.

So, it made perfect sense to call on the 26-year-old to launch new plus-size SLiNK magazine and denim brand Beauty In Curves’ pop-up boutique yesterday.

Whitney, who won the modelling show back in 2008, told MailOnline that she’s extremely proud to be representing the new boutique because it goes where no other designers have gone before.

‘Rivkie, who curated the store, travels to New York and searches the markets for good quality pieces that are worth the money, instead of polyester crap that many designers sell,’ she said.

Outspoken Whitney believes that the British plus-size market is seriously lacking.

‘In London, there aren’t that many plus-size options or designers. The UK is behind in identifying with the plus-size consumer. I’m not sure that America has embraced it necessarily but they have got the products.’

Sharing her top tips on dressing, Whitney emphasised one key point: ‘Wear clothes that fit you,’ she said. ‘That’s the number one issue. Women try and cover themselves up so they wear clothes that are too big but it makes them look frumpy. I cut the sizes out of everything - you don’t need to know.

Panache lingerie campaign and says she will never bow to pressure to 
lose weight for the sake of fashion

‘There will never be one perfect size. Kate Upton is a size 8 and some people say she’s too fat and she looks like a cow.

‘We are never going to be a size that is generally accepted by everyone so you have to get over it. Especially with airbrushing, we are trying to look like an image that literally doesn’t exist.

'There will never be one perfect size. Kate Upton is a size 8 and some people say she's too fat and she looks like a cow,' says Whitney

‘Plus-size starts at a size 6 (UK size 10) in the U.S. but the average woman is a size 10 (UK size 14) so we are telling people that even if you’re half the size of the average woman, you’re too fat. Why? Probably because it sells; it makes women feel bad about themselves and they buy more products.

‘If men were only attracted to women who looked like Victoria Beckham, then we would all look like her. But they’re not and that’s why we are all different shapes and sizes.’

Whitney has taken it upon herself to spread her message to the masses in her role as an ambassador for the National Eating Disorder Association.

She travels to Universities all over the States and attends global charity events to support the cause.

Speaking about her work, she said: ‘After winning the show I knew I wanted to be involved in philanthropy and as the only plus-size model in the history of the show I knew I needed to do something in touch with that; it felt like a good fit for me.

‘University age is when you’re deciding who you’re going to be for the rest of your life so I love that I’m impacting on people.’

And it seems like her hard work is paying off. She was recently named one of the most influential women in the world, beating off stiff competition from the likes of Hilary Clinton and Michelle Obama.

‘It was a really big deal, I was totally surprised by that and I didn’t realise the impact of what I do,’ she said.

One thing Whitney refuses to do is bow to pressure to eat less or exercise more in the name of her figure.

‘I travel all the time, I haven’t 
been home in over a year because I am literally on a plane every other 
day’ (she recently shot 200 outfits in one day during a shoot in 
Istanbul.)

‘When I can and I have the energy, I run because it’s the easiest thing to do but I don’t ever do anything I don’t want to do.

‘I’ll
eat what I want to and I think that’s the problem – people stop 
listening to their bodies and start listening to the media.

‘We
have a multi-million pound diet industry that wants us to think we are 
fat so they succeed, they get our favourite celebrities on board and the
problem is that no one is listening to themselves.

‘If I want a steak and chips, I am going to eat it and when I feel like going on a run, I will.

‘But I’m never going to force myself to do that. Life is too short; I could walk outside and get hit by a bus so I may as well eat what I want to eat,’ she said.

‘I think what is hard about the plus-size industry is that you’re never the right size. I’ve had people telling me to lose weight as well as gain weight.

‘At the end of the day, you have to look in the mirror and say: “This is it, this is the only body I’ve got.”

‘I’ve definitely been criticised for marching to the beat of my own drum but I take pride in that. You can’t listen to anyone.

‘It hurts. I’ll get called a fat cow or that I am huge. People are harsh. The show is in over one hundred countries so I get hate mail from lots of people but the fan mail is worth so much more than that.

‘I get letters saying “my daughter had bulimia for two years and because of you she has sought treatment”, and just that one fan letter is worth more than all the hate letter in the world.

‘It’s so much more motivational than one saying “you’re fat”.’

Hard worker: Whitney worked with Rihanna on a CoverGirl campaign, as well as working with TOWIE star Gemma Collins, who she says is 'hilarious' and has a great plus-size clothing collection

On top of helping young women beat their demons, Whitney has been working non-stop. Earlier this month she posed in her underwear for a Panache campaign (and she’s already shot another one with the lingerie label) and she is about to pen a column in SLiNK magazine about her life as a plus-size model.

She even scored an opportunity to work with superstar Rihanna in a CoverGirl commercial.

'Life is too short; I could walk outside and get hit by a bus so I may as well eat what I want to eat'

‘She was really nice actually, her posse was really kind of rude but she was one of the first celebrities I worked with and she was telling me I was beautiful. Wow,’ she said of the surreal experience.

Another fellow celebrity she has huge respect for is TOWIE star Gemma Collins, who she once worked with.

‘Gemma didn’t know who I was but she kept telling me I should be an impersonator for Anna Nicole Smith, she’s hilarious.

‘She has some pretty maxi dresses in her plus-size range. She’s a great spokesperson and has undoubtedly grown up a plus-size girl and didn’t have a lot of options.’

Despite hanging out with superstars, Tennessee-born Whitney does find that the hard work takes its toll. ‘There’s times when I wake up and I don’t know what country I’m in and I did it alone for a long time but now I have a boyfriend and he is travelling with me so that’s really good.

‘We met at high school and randomly got back in touch recently. He is amazing and unbelievably supportive. It’s hard for guys to date someone who does what I do.’

Big break: Whitney walks on the catwalk at a Versace fashion show as part of the final series 10 ANTM show

WhilE she has been occupying her days with Vogue Italia shoots and fashion campaigns, her ultimate dream is to open a bakery.

‘I have a YouTube channel called Curvy Kitchen and I make pumpkin bread, sugar cookies, chocolate covered peanut balls and snicker doodles.

‘My boyfriend was a chef. I would love to open a bakery with him when I settle down and slow down at work,’ she said.

But for now, she is happy carrying the torch for her fellow curvy females.

‘The reason I went on top model was because I wanted to live out my motto: “You must be the change you wish to see in the world”.

‘There was no other plus-size model that was really outspoken about the industry and I feel like I have accomplished everything that was on my check-list.

‘If I did stop modelling tomorrow, I would be satisfied with the work I have done.’

  SLiNK Boutique and Beauty in Curves have opened a pop-up shop on Blandford Street, London.

Both aim to create beautiful and well fitting clothes for curvy women, and the store features jeans and occasion wear.

Beauty in Curves are a premium denim brand who use clever tricks (like in-built shapewear and perfectly positioned pockets) to give women the ultimate slimming jeans.

SLiNK Boutique describes itself as a 'highly curated, luxury fashion boutique for women size 16+.

'Hot looks for cool curves, SLiNK boutique's buyers hunt down the most on-trend looks and most enviable styles and designers from around the world, bringing them together in their multi-brand online hub.'
