Lawsuit: Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan was killed in Tehran in January when two motorcyclists attached a magnetic bomb attached to his car

The families of nuclear scientists from Iran who were assassinated in 2010 have filed a lawsuit against Israel, the U.S. and Britain, saying the countries are responsible for the deaths of their loved ones.

Rahim Ahmadi Roshan, father of Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, the slain chemistry expert and a director of the Natanz uranium enrichment facility in central Iran, said the families are demanding those behind the killings should be brought to justice.

At a press conference in Tehran today, he said: 'We've filed an indictment against the 
Zionist regime and the arrogant powers.

'(The 
judiciary) is to pursue this case with the relevant international 
bodies.'

Earlier this month, Iran's state television broadcast the purported confessions of 14 suspects held in connection with the killing of five nuclear scientists since 2010.

The television also showed pictures from a military garrison, said to be a training camp outside Tel Aviv in Israel.

It said the suspects took courses there, including how to place magnetic bombs on cars, which was the method used to assassinate the scientists.

The suspects said in the purported confessions that they received training in Israel.

Iran claims the attacks are part of a covert campaign by Israel and the West to sabotage its nuclear programme, which the US and its allies suspect is aimed at producing nuclear weapons. Iran has denied this.

The country has also blamed Israel's Mossad, as well as the CIA and Britain's MI6 for the assassinations, with support from some of Iran's neighbors.

The U.S. and Britain have denied involvement in the slayings. Israel has not commented.

'Through this complaint, we declare to the world that actions of arrogant governments, led by the U.S., Britain and the occupying Zionist regime, in assassinating nuclear scientists and elites is against human principles,' said a statement read out by Mansoureh Karami, wife of slain Tehran University physics professor, Masoud Ali Mohammadi.

She added: 'While filing our complaint and announcing our protest, we resolutely declare that not only will such disgraceful acts not prevent the advancement of the children of this land in science, it will cause them to take more effective steps with greater determination.'

Under suspicion: Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, where Majid Shahriari worked, has been accused by the West of producing nuclear weapons

In May, Iran hanged Majid Jamali Fashi, 24, who was sentenced to death for the 2010 killing of Ali Mohammadi.

Fashi, who said in televised confessions that he was recruited by Mossad, was convicted last August.

Officials say the campaign against Iran includes the abduction of Iranian scientists, the sale of faulty equipment and the planting of a destructive computer worm known as Stuxnet, which briefly brought Iran's uranium enrichment activity to a halt in 2010.
