A Florida couple was arrested early Sunday after the woman attacked her boyfriend with a box of condoms.

What is typically used as a form of protection was anything but that when Dominique Claridge, 19, threw a box of condom's at her boyfriend, 19-year-old William Hessian's eye, leaving him with minor bruising, according to The Smoking Gun.  

Police arrested the quarreling love birds  for domestic battery due to the verbal argument turned physical.
