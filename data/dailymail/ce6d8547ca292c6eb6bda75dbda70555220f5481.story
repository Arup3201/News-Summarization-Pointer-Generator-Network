For those who want to combine the pleasures of caravanning with boating in a single holiday the wait is over.

An extraordinary £13,000 amphibious caravan, dubbed the Sealander by its German designer, is set to ensure road and boat trips will never be the same again.

The floating two-in-one two-bed mobile home has been created by Daniel Straub, a German-based industrial designer, to combine the features of an electric power boat and a camping trailer.

It took him two years to design, build and test the Sealander so that he could mass produce and sell it.

The innovative floating caravan boasts onboard cooking, cleaning, eating and sleeping facilities and can move around on water thanks to an electric motor.

And its creator said: 'This extends the possibilities of camping and leisure. Whoever travels with our floating caravan can spend free time on both land and on water.

Perfect towing mate: The Sealander can be hitched to a car with a trailer like any other caravan

Perfect spot: With its amphibious capabilities the Sealander can stay on land or go on water

'It's just like a holiday should be - up to them and unlimited possibilities.

'You can settle for the night at the campsite and during the day sunbathe, cruise on the lake or even go fishing for dinner.

'You can even up sticks and settle on the next island if the camp site is crowded. I think the advantages offered by the Sealander are varied and different for everyone.'

Bedtime: The interior of the Sealander has two bench seats which double as beds. It also has cooking and washing facilities onboard just like any other caravan or boat

So far the Sealander can only be used in shallow waters but Daniel is already looking at building vans which can take to deeper waters and even the sea.

His current design has a clever double hull which means that should the outer shell spring a leak, only the sub-floor will fill with water, ensuring that it remains afloat.

Daniel added: 'The body shape of the trailer, or the 'case', is made of fibreglass-reinforced plastic and then connected to a water-tight chassis.

'So the Sealander is drawn on land as a 
caravan and when needed can be lowered into the water. On the water it 
can then be moved independently using a motor.

'In future I hope to develop larger versions of the floating caravans which can run on other waters.'

The Sealander is expected to go on sale for camping/boating enthusiasts at the start of next year with a price tag of £13,000.

It is not the first time cars and boats have been combined.

Since the 1920s there have been numerous designs but amphibious craft have been most commonly used for search and rescue purposes and in military applications.

Visitors to London and Boston can even see the sights from amphibious Duck vehicles designed to take visitors around on both land and on the river.
