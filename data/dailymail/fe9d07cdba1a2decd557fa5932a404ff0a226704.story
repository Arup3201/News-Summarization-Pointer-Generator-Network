Republican Florida Rep. Trey Radel told is taking a leave of absence from Congress following his conviction on a narcotics possession charge in Washington, D.C.

But the 'cocaine congressman' is resisting calls for his resignation, and dodging the toughest questions journalists have lobbed at him.

He told reporters in a scripted press conference Wednesday night that wants 'to be held accountable for the bad decisions that I made in my life,' and ultimately to 'be a role model for millions of others that are struggling with this disease.'

Radel has blamed a drinking problem for his drug use. His mother, he said Wednesday, also battled alcoholism. She died during his 2009 wedding reception.

'Sometimes in life you need a wakeup call,' he said. 'This is my wakeup call.'

He plans to donate his salary to a charity while he's pursuing drug rehab treatment, beginning with time in an 'intensive inpatient' facility.

Radel received a sentence of one year's supervised probation and a small fine for buying 3.5 grams of cocaine from an undercover policeman. If he stays out of trouble, his conviction will be expunged from his record.

'I have no excuse for what I have done,' he said Wednesday night.

'I’ve let down our country. I've let down our constituents. I've let down my wife. And even though he doesn't know it, I've let down my two-year-old son.'

Radel was elected to Congress in November 2012, and represents the South Florida cities of cities of Fort Myers, Cape Coral, Naples and Sanibel Island.

Radel's wife Amy is 'my rock,' he said, and his two-year-old son Henry is 'my little guy' -- but Mrs. Radel was nowhere to be seen during the press conference

Radel says he's 'taking responsibility' for buying cocaine from an undercover officer, but some Floridians won't be satisfied until he resigns

He's a former conservative talk radio host who came to Washington on the crest of a tea party wave, and – and now faces intense criticism because of the conservative values that he parlayed into a political victory.

Vacancy? Trey Radel's office door was closed all day Wednesday, and his staff wasn't talking to the media

'You've admitted to breaking the law yourself!' one reported shouted Wednesday night.

No answer.

'You voted to drug-test people who have food stamps!' yelled another.

No answer.

'You were on the floor voting the day that the bust happened,' a third blared. 'How do you expect to be a qualified lawmaker when you were living a lie yourself?'

No answer.

According to the Fort Myers News-Press, Radel has told the chairman of the Lee County Republican Party that he will return to work after the December congressional recess, and serve out his term.

Connie Mack IV, the former congressman whose seat Radel how holds, said in a statement after the Wednesday night press conference that 'I certainly hope Trey gets the help he needs.'

'Time and his own actions will determine whether the people are willing to give him a second chance.'
