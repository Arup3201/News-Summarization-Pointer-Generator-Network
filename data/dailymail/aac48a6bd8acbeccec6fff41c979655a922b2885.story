A woman who was pushed down a flight of stairs as an overweight schoolgirl has lost seven stone so she can finally have an operation on the knee which cruel school bullies left seriously damaged.

Lynzee Harper, 25, was bullied for being fat from a very young age but on her second day at secondary school the taunting took a dangerous turn.

Miss Harper was pushed down the school stairs by bullies who joked they wanted to 'see if she would bounce'. Miss Harper was rushed to hospital with a twisted knee.

Lynzee was bullied for her weight at school and even pushed down the stairs by a classmate, but she has now lost seven stone and put the cruel taunts behind her 

Lindsay is now considerably slimmer having beaten her demons and her school bullies by slimming down by seven stone

Years later her weight peaked at 19st 3lbs, which put huge pressure on her weakened knee, compounding her discomfort.

Today, Miss Harper has had the last laugh, losing an impressive 7st through dieting, allowing her to feel the full benefit of a knee operation to repair the damage she sustained as a child. .

She said: 'I worked hard to lose my weight so I could have the operation to correct my busted knee which has blighted me since childhood. I managed it and now I look and feel fantastic.

'The cruel school bullies tried to break me when they pushed me down those stairs - but they failed. I bounced back and now I've had the last laugh.'

At school Lynzee was bullied for her weight and was pushed down the stairs by one of the prefects

Lynzee is now happy to pose for photos having lost weight, but before she said her confidence was crushed by bullies 

Miss Harper, who lives with her fiance David McKie, 46, has struggled with her weight since childhood. She was bullied at school due to her large size.

She said: 'I got bullied at primary school even at that young age, cruel kids called me 'fatty' and stole my packed lunch.

'I thought things would change when I left primary school but by the time I reached high school, I was an easy target for school bullies.'

While at school in Rutland in the east Midlands, 11-year-old Miss Harper was pushed down the stairs by a prefect.

She said: 'On my second day, I was walking down a flight of stairs on my way to a music class when I heard a prefect whisper behind me 'I wonder if she'd bounce if she fell to the bottom.'

'Before I knew it, I felt an almighty push and I was sent tumbling down the stairs, landing with a crunch.'

After school Lynzee continued to put on weight as an adult which made her injured knee more painful

She signed up to her local Scottish Slimmers club. Within 20 months she had shed a staggering seven stone. 

In agony she was rushed to hospital where she was told by medics that the fall had twisted her knee so it was facing the wrong way.

Miss Harper was forced to use a wheelchair and crutches while she recovered. The bullying she faced while in school was so severe Miss Harper and her family moved up to Scotland for a fresh start.

She said: 'At my new school people accepted me for who I am, not what I looked like. I took up kickboxing and tentatively rebuilt my confidence. I started to have some self-esteem.'

Despite her increased confidence Miss Harper, of Lockerbie, Dumfries, Scotland, still struggled with her weight.

Her weight skyrocketed after giving birth to her daughter Sarah, now five, and her son Aaron, two.

Juggling responsibilities as a parent with work commitments Miss Harper ate takeaway and snacked on chocolate bars and crisps.

Soon she weighed in at 19st 3lbs and hid her hulking frame under size 26 clothes.

She said: 'Life as a busy mother was hectic and I'd scoff convenience processed foods like chicken kievs and oven chips.'

Eventually doctors told her that her extreme weight gain was creating unnecessary strain on her weakened knee, which was regularly dislocating.

Miss Harper, a chef, was told she needed to lose weight so she could have an operation to fix the injury which had plagued her since high school.

She said: 'The a surgeon offered me a way out - reconstructive surgery. But there was a catch. To qualify for the op I'd need to lose weight to make sure I would recover properly afterwards.'

Determined to change Miss Harper swapped greasy takeaways and fatty snacks for lean meat and fresh vegetables.

Lynzee is now a size 12 and here she proudly shows off the difference whilst holding up an old pair of her size 26 jeans

She signed up to her local Scottish Slimmers club. Within 20 months she had shed a staggering seven stone.

Lynzee now weighs 12st 3lbs and wears size 12 clothes. She said: 'I was eating healthily and exercising. I walked everywhere and joined the gym.

'Since the operation and my drastic weight loss my knee no longer gives me any trouble. I feel fantastic and love flaunting my new size 12 figure in flattering outfits.'

It took her seven months to recover from the operation. Lynzee and David, a maintenance worker, are getting married in September this year.

She said: 'I'm looking forward to my wedding - I can't wait to show off my new figure in front of friends and family.

'I look back at those bullies and it reminds me to always be kind to people. Nobody should go through what I had to go through and I never want my kids to go through anything like that.'
