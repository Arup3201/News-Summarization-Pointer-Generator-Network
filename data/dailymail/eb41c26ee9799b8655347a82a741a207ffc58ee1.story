An artwork that has been on display for sixteen years has been draped in black cloth and may be removed after years of complaints from Hawaiian elders.

Artist Hans Ladislaus' 'Forgotten Inheritance', which features human bones in sand, has been on display at the Hawaii Convention Center since 1997.

However the Hawaii Tourism Authority which runs the center has succumbed to persistent opposition from native Hawaiian descendents who say the use of exposed ancestral bones is disrespectful.

Controversy: Native Hawaiians have complained about the 'cultural insensitivity' of artist Hans Ladislaus' work 'Forgotten Inheritance' ever since it was installed at the Hawaii Convention Center in 1997, but only now are their wishes being honored

Removal: The Hawaii Convention Center has covered Hans Ladislaus' controversial artwork with black cloth - and may remove it permanently - after decades of complaints from native Hawaiians

The wall art was controversially covered up on Wednesday night during the 12th annual Native Hawaiian Convention.

Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation executive director Moses Haia represents Paulette Ka'anohiokalani Kaleikini, a 
recognized cultural descendant of the area, who has complained repeatedly to the 
Hawai'i Tourism Authority about the piece.

'I don't know what the motive of the artist was with respect to what was depicted,' Haia told Hawaii News Now.

'I certainly know that in Hawai'i and given our cultural practices – when it comes to malama iwi, which is taking care of our ancestral bones, that it's a significant sign of disrespect.

'Based upon her cultural responsibility to malama iwi, [Kaleikini] met with what I believe was certain individuals with the Hawaii Tourism Authority that runs the Convention Center and requested, based upon her cultural practices, that panel be taken down because of what it stood for.'

It is not clear why the center has now decided to uphold the complaints of elders, particularly as none of the highly respected committee members - including Native Hawaiians - objected to the work when it was selected and commissioned in 1996.

State Arts Foundation officials say 
they've been trying unsuccessfully to arrange a meeting with Ladislaus –
who now lives on the mainland – and Convention Center officials, Native
Hawaiian burial stakeholders and others offended by the artwork.

'The State Foundation has long hoped the situation could be resolved by ho'oponopono in a spirit of understanding and cooperation. We still do,' Oahu Commissioner of the Hawaii State Foundation on Culture and the Arts, Peter Rosegg,  told Hawaii News Now.

Hawai'i Tourism Authority CEO Mike McCartney said action was being taken to replace the artwork.

'The HTA is working with the State Foundation to replace a piece of artwork in the Hawai'i Convention Center,' he said, according to KITV.com.

'It is important for us to honor and perpetuate our host culture and we are looking to include more pieces by Native Hawaiian artists.'

However Rosegg said the piece, which is permanently mounted, could be destroyed if it's removed.

KITV.com also reported the federal Visual Artists Rights Act prohibits the state foundation from altering or covering part or all of a work without the artist permission.
