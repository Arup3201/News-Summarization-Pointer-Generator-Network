Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann want to question British ex-pat Robert Murat, a Portuguese newspaper reported yesterday.

Scotland Yard detectives want to speak to several potential witnesses including Mr Murat, who was previously questioned by Portuguese police after Madeleine vanished in 2007 just before her fourth birthday, the newspaper Jornal de Noticias reported.

Mr Murat, 41, who has always denied any involvement in Madeleine’s disappearance, said neither he nor his lawyer had been contacted by police, but said he would co-operate if contacted.

He told the Guardian: ‘My conscience is clear and I have no problem speaking to police again.’

His lawyer Francisco Pagarete told the Daily Mail: ‘My client has not been sent any notification from any official. If the police want to talk to my client it is ok, he will talk to them.’

Mr Murat was named as an arguido – a person of interest or suspect - during the Portuguese investigation seven years ago, as were Madeleine’s parents Kate and Gerry McCann.

All three were later cleared when the Portuguese investigation ended in 2008.

Scotland Yard launched its own investigation and its inquiry team travelled to Praia da Luz to conduct searches and observe Portuguese police interviews.

The Operation Grange inquiry team has reportedly asked Portuguese police to question four potential witnesses, including Mr Murat.

The property consultant lived in Praia da Luz in 2007, only a few hundred yards from the McCanns’ rented holiday flat where Madeleine vanished.

Mr Murat was later paid £600,000 in libel damages by 11 British newspapers, including the Daily Mail, and the broadcaster Sky over reports which falsely alleged there were strong grounds for believing he was involved in her disappearance.

A Scotland Yard spokeswoman refused to comment on the Portuguese article and said the force would not give ‘a running commentary’ on its investigation.
