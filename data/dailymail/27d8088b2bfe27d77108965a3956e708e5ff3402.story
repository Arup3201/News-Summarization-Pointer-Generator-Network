Desperate attempts by Ed Balls to distance Labour from the Co-operative Bank scandal foundered last night as startling new evidence emerged of the intimate ties between the party and the stricken lender.

The Shadow Chancellor angrily attacked what he branded a 'smear' campaign over Labour’s connections with disgraced former Co-op boss Paul Flowers, who is under police investigation for allegedly buying crack cocaine and crystal meth.

Mr Balls insisted that Flowers, a former business adviser to leader Ed Miliband, was 'out, out, out' of the Labour Party.

But questions intensified over the opposition's cosy relationship with the bank after it emerged that Mr Balls had bragged about his role in rubber-stamping legislation that paved the way for a disastrous takeover deal at the Co-op.

He also accepted a £50,000 donation from the group in March 2012, when Flowers was the bank’s chairman.

There were also mounting questions about the extraordinary special treatment the bank gave to Labour - extending 'soft' loans with preferential rates of interest and admitting that other clients would never be allowed to keep on borrowing so much.

When Labour was on the brink of bankruptcy, then general secretary Peter Watt had a meeting with a senior Co-op executive at which it was agreed that vast debts would not be called in. On another dramatic day in the spiralling scandal:

Mr Miliband yesterday hit back at what aides said was a concerted Government smear campaign over the extent of the Labour leadership’s links with Flowers. 'What this episode shows is more about the character of the Prime Minister than about the character of Labour’s relationship with the Co-op,' he said.

'We have a Prime Minister who, when he sees a serious situation at the bank, tries to make cheap political points rather than sorting it out.'

And in a series of increasingly bad-tempered TV and radio interviews, Mr Balls insisted that he had known nothing about the allegations concerning the former Co-op Bank chairman. He said Flowers had been suspended from Labour membership and was 'out, out, out'.

Mr Balls said he would not repay a 
£50,000 donation his office received from the Co-operative Group – 
saying he was 'proud' to have received it.

He claimed the donation had nothing to 
do with Flowers, even though the former bank boss told MPs this month 
that he had helped to arrange it. 'I am proud to have that donation,' 
the Shadow Chancellor insisted. 'They made a donation to me last year 
which I am very proud of and was properly declared.'

Mr Balls rejected Tory calls for him to 
repay the cash, insisting: 'I have not got £50,000 in my office to give 
back and I don’t think it would be the right thing to do.

He denied discussing the donation with Flowers, saying: 'I have never in my life had a conversation with Paul Flowers about that matter or any other. Paul Flowers was not involved in that in any way.'

Challenged about Flowers’s evidence to MPs, Mr Balls suggested it could not be trusted.

'He was someone who was buying drugs and engaged with rent boys,' he said. 'He has made a lot of allegations. There is no truth in that at all.'

However, the Shadow Chancellor faced fresh questions as it emerged that he boasted in 2010 that as a minister in the last government, he had ensured Treasury support for a 'super-mutual' deal which saw the Co-op merge with Britannia Building Society.

As a result of the failed takeover, thousands of small investors face losses, 50 branches could close and job losses will be in the thousands.

When he was trying to win the Labour leadership contest, Mr Balls said: 'I promoted co-operatives throughout my time in government... I was able to show this by ensuring Treasury support for a new Private Member’s Bill that led to the creation of the first ever “super-mutual”, bringing Britannia Building Society and the Co-op Bank together in the interests of customers, rather than the banking elite.'

Conservative MP Brooks Newmark said: 'This raises serious concerns about Ed Balls’s relationship with the Co-op Bank and the role he played in this merger. It also proves a sham of recent attempts by Mr Balls to distance himself from the Co-op Bank.'

A spokesman for Mr Balls said: 'The decision by the Co-op Bank in 2009 to merge with the Britannia Building Society was a commercial one for the bank which Ed had absolutely no involvement in.'

Former general secretary Mr Watt’s memoirs give further evidence of the special treatment afforded by the bank to Labour.

Recalling a meeting as he sought to fend off bankruptcy for the party in 2006, he says a Co-op executive told him: 'I’m coming under huge pressure at my end to demonstrate that we’re not going to lose all our money. Under normal circumstances, with other clients, we would not even be having this conversation. We’d just pull the plug.'

One well-placed source said: 'Why did the Co-op allow the party to get into that level of debt? In 2005 the party really overspent and had a multi-million pound overdraft from the Co-op.

'The overdraft essentially stayed the same. There was no requirement to reduce it. It was just held.

'Some of the account managers were uncomfortable at the levels of the debt the party was being given. The party was in serious trouble, it had no capital - there was nothing to underwrite. There’s no doubt that preferential treatment was given because of the political friendship.'

Paul Flowers has enjoyed a host of high-profile roles over the past 20 years in the Labour Party, the Methodist church, charities and the Co-operative Group. They include:

Chairman of the Co-op BankJoined the board in 2008 then appointed chairman in April 2010 on a salary of £132,000. Stepped down in June 2013. Also deputy chairman of the Co-operative Group.

Trustee of investment funds and property at the Methodist ChurchStarted work as a Methodist minister as a graduate in 1976. Suspended indefinitely on Wednesday ahead of an investigation by church officials and is expected to face a disciplinary hearing.
