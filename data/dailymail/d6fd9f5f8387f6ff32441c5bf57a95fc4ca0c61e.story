Daley Blind only has to look as far as his father for the perfect role model, and the Manchester United midfielder admits he will attempt to mould himself on Danny Blind's leadership skills.

Blind's father, who earned 42 caps for Holland as a defender and played for Ajax for 13 years, was described by United boss Louis van Gaal as a leader, and insisted the midfielder must become that on the field.

Daley moved from Ajax for £14million in the summer and has impressed overall with his performances so far, and Van Gaal suggested he is a better player than his father was.

Danny Blind lifts the Amstel Dutch Cup in 1998 with Ajax, who he played for over 300 times.

Danny played over 300 times for Ajax, winning five league titles, four Dutch cups, the Champions League, the UEFA Cup, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup. 

Van Gaal told the Manchester Evening News: 'Maybe his son is better (as a player) but he is still not a leader. But that is a process.'

Blind later responded to Van Gaal's words, and said: 'I read it. I hope I become a bit of a leader like my dad was, but I am still young. I am still improving and this is a new era for me, coming to a new area.

'But I can be that (a leader). I have to learn it and have to keep it up but I am learning every day, including about being a leader.'

Blind also admitted that while Van Gaal's training sessions are tough, the team are improving every game, with three wins in their last four games.

'I think the players are getting used to [Van Gaal’s methods]. The players like to work with him. Everyone is picking it up very well,' he added.

'Training is very hard and very serious and we improve every day and you could see that in the first half [of the 2-1 win] against Everton.'

Blind should represent Holland for the 22nd time in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Kazakhstan on Friday.
