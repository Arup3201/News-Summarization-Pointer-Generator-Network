Wales scrum-half Rhys Webb has become the latest player to sign a national dual contract.

The Welsh Rugby Union announced 26-year-old Webb is the eighth player to agree a deal that is funded by the WRU and Wales' regional teams - in Webb's case, the Ospreys - following Sam Warburton, Dan Lydiate, Jake Ball, Samson Lee, Rhodri Jones, Tyler Morgan and Hallam Amos.

Webb has been one of Wales' form players this season, scoring four tries in his last seven Tests.

'Rhys has established himself as a proven international scrum-half and fully deserves a national dual contract,' Wales head coach Warren Gatland said.

'He has impressed at regional level for the Ospreys, and this ensures his future here, which will prove an enormous benefit to professional rugby in Wales.'

And Webb added: 'I am enjoying my rugby at the Ospreys and with Wales, and this allows me to build on that.

'Now my future is confirmed, I can focus all my attention of becoming a better rugby player.'

Webb, who lines up for Wales in next Saturday's RBS 6 Nations finale against Italy in Rome, is set to be a key part of Gatland's World Cup plans later this year.

WRU group chief executive Roger Lewis said: 'Rhys Webb is a fantastic player and talent, who is a great addition to our list of national dual-contracted players.

'We now have an incredible mixture of experience and youth who have committed their future to Wales and the regions.'
