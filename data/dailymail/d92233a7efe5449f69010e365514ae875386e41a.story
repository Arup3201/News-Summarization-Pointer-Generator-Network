By all rights the golfing world should be agog following Rory McIlroy’s wondrous display in Dubai, Tiger Woods’s jaw-dropping troubles in Phoenix and the astonishing feat of a 17-year-old girl from New Zealand becoming the youngest world No 1 in the entire game’s history.

Instead, the two main topics of conversation are the act of sheer lunacy in taking live coverage of The Open off terrestrial television and McIlroy’s court case involving his former management company which is due to begin in Dublin on Tuesday.

If you want to shoot yourself in the foot, why not do it like golf — and use a howitzer?

Rory McIlroy is heading for a potentially lengthy court case with his former management company

The Northern Irishman reportedly made an £8million offer to settle the case out of court

McIlroy has reached that blessed state precious few golfers ever manage, where they begin knowing that if they summon up 85 per cent of their capabilities in any given week there really is nothing anyone else can do.

And yet, in a state of affairs that almost beggars belief, the eagles that will be on the 25-year-old’s mind for the next fortnight or more will be of the legal kind.

I have it on decent authority that McIlroy offered €10million (almost £8m) to settle out of court with Horizon Sports and its owner, Conor Ridge, and end what the world No 1 described himself as a ‘tedious and nasty business’.

But Ridge, with his reputation at stake, appears determined to have his day, or rather his several weeks, in court.

It promises to be toe-curlingly tawdry at times and wholly damaging to a sport that relies so much on the goodwill of big business to keep the show on the road. What will the CEOs be thinking as the two sides tear lumps out of one another and the financial affairs of the sport’s most marketable commodity are laid bare?

What’s it all about? McIlroy is both suing Horizon and being counter-sued in turn for unpaid fees.

In a nutshell, Horizon believe they have a watertight contract entitling them to somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent of McIlroy’s endorsement money until 2017.

Given that Nike alone will pay McIlroy $100m over the duration, it’s not hard to see why Ridge is fighting tooth and nail.

McIlroy’s lawyers will argue the contract signed was ‘unconscionable, and an improvident bargain’, and that McIlroy was coerced into signing it without proper legal representation.

You can just imagine what the senior counsel are going to be like seeking to prove their respective arguments, can’t you?

In Dubai on Sunday, McIlroy didn’t sound like a man who expected the matter to be settled on the steps of Dublin’s Four Courts on Tuesday morning. He talked about being in the witness stand for as much as two weeks, before being blissfully released to concentrate on his preparations for the Masters in April.

Thankfully, it’s unlikely to affect him at all in that regard. As he showed in the Middle East last week, he’s become brilliant at putting the blinkers on.

And so by some time next month we should be back where we want to be, watching the man who has taken European golf to a whole new level demonstrating why he’s going to rewrite every meaningful UK record.

But first to the Four Courts, where alongside a couple of murder trials, we find a sport seemingly consumed with a death wish.

‘The accusations made against me are serious and were intended to damage my reputation and character. They will not be taken lightly. My team and representatives are looking into all aspects of this matter, and we look forward to setting the record straight.’

American Ryder Cup star Patrick Reed responds to a lurid series of allegations in a new book, in which the four-time PGA Tour winner is said to have cheated in tournaments and stolen money from team-mates during his college days at Augusta State University. 

He was said to have been so unpopular that his team-mates were hoping he’d lose his match when they reached the National Championship final. We might not have heard the last of this one, I fancy.

TEEN ACE KO SMASHES TIGER'S RECORD

The minimum age to play on the women’s PGA Tour in America is supposed to be 18 but what choice did they have but to waive this regulation in the face of the startling performances of Lydia Ko?

Ko reached world No 1 at 17 - four years before Tiger Woods managed when he topped the rankings in 1997

By the time the exemption was granted last June, the extraordinary Kiwi was already a two-time champion, including a victory in the Canadian Open at the age of 15. 

Seven months on from becoming a member, and still only 17, she reached the summit of the women’s world rankings last Saturday, beating Tiger Woods, the previous record- holder of either sex, by four years.

What an achievement that is, given the welcome revival in women’s golf in America, led by the likes of Michelle Wie, Stacy Lewis and Lexi Thompson.
