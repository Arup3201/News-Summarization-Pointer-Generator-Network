Laser light diffracted by a hologram, microscopic details from a man-made fabric and a scaffolds for stimulating bone growth, are among the winners of a photo competition designed to show the diversity of engineering.

There were over 150 entries to the University of Cambridge Department of Engineering's annual photographic competition, some of which focused on recognisable structures such as pylons and cars, while others studied objects in microscopic detail.

The completion aims to show that engineering is not only about fixing machines and building bridges, but involves everything from nanomaterials and biology to building towering structures.

Diffraction sun: Mr Palani shone a laser light onto a small liquid crystal device, causing the light to interfere with itself and become diffracted. His sun-like image is the result of this diffraction. The research behind this image could potentially help create a microscope that would allow people to see very fast and very small objects, such as a virus infecting a cell

Ioannis Mastoris and Ronan Daly were the joint winners of the second prize with their electron microscopy image of the reflective coating and fibrous cloth of a man-made fabric. Their photograph was taken as part of a research project focusing on the life-cycle of these fabrics and their research could help decrease the environmental impact of the fibre-dyeing process

It had five categories this year - first, second and third prizes as well as a prize for a micrograph captured using an electron microscope and a Head of Department's prize for the photo or video with the most innovative engineering story behind it.

Entrants included students and professors who were told the their images must be 'beautiful, fascinating, intriguing, amusing or possibly all of these things.'

The first prize went to researcher Ananta Palani for his entry called diffraction sun.

This is a simulation of a chaotic dynamic system portrayed using software that forms these spectacular fractals, or mathematical sets. The colouring was added to the image to show the velocity and angles between consecutive points

The information collected will be fed into models for analysis in order to predict the behaviour of future complex tunnel geometries

Dr Spear is exploring porous magnetic materials to encourage cell and tissue in-growth into an implant surface and to improve the connection between bone and implant. In the image, human stem cells are growing into fibre networks. The actin cytoskeleton of the cells is stained green, while the nuclei are fluorescent blue. The image shows that the cells have attached between the fibres shown in grey

The PhD student shone a laser light onto a
small liquid crystal device, causing the light to interfere with itself
and become diffracted. Palani’s sun-like image is the result of this 
diffraction.

The research behind this image could 
potentially help create a microscope that would allow people to see very
fast and very small objects, such as a virus infecting a cell, which at
the moment can only be observed with great difficulty.

Ioannis Mastoris and Ronan Daly were 
the joint winners of the second prize with their electron microscopy 
image of the reflective coating and fibrous cloth of a man-made fabric.

This image shows an emulsion of blue ink droplets in oil produced using a microfluidic device. The aim was to mix two fluids and produce nano-litre sized droplets of the mixed solution in oil. A chip with this function can be used or to study the movement of chemicals

Their
photograph was taken as part of a research project focusing on the life-cycle of these fabrics and their research could help decrease the 
environmental impact of the fibre-dyeing process.

Phil Catton, who works in the Department’s Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction, won third prize for his image called mirror finish.

His photograph shows a 3D laser scanner that is being used to measure deformations in the London Underground 
Northern Line station at Euston.

This image depicts a wing that is flat on the bottom and curved on top (like the kind used on airplanes) which is simultaneously rotating and travelling along rapidly over a short distance through water. The vortices are visualised by injecting a dye composed of milk and water. Mr Stevens' work is targeted towards understanding the aerodynamics of small insects with an intended application for Micro-Air Vehicles

The information collected will be 
fed into models for analysis in order to predict the 
behaviour of future complex tunnel geometries and will be
a valuable tool in the future as new underground tunnels are built.

'The winning images are diverse, beautiful and meaningful,' said Philip Guildford, Director of Research at Zeiss, which supported the competition.

'They all tell wonderful stories of 
engineering students, researchers and academics seeking to discover new 
scientific truths and advance technology.

Liquid crystalline molecules are fascinating compounds and conceal the whole colourful universe within them. They reveal these mesmerising textures under polarised microscope

'The winners give an 
eye-catching glimpse of work in the Department of Engineering, but there
were over 150 other entrants this year, each communicating their unique
message of how engineering is advancing and helping the World. The 
breadth and quality of work is quite staggering,' he said.

Brajith Srigengan won a prize for his 
image of a bone cell branching across two steel fibres, which
was photographed as part of a research project focusing on the effect 
that coating a hip implant with fibrin, a protein gel, has on the body’s
inflammation process.

There were many other images entered into the competition, including Kai Ying’s chemical vapour deposition graphene samples that look like a starry sky at night, Eric Pickering’s sequential frames charting a ballistic impact, and Tom Rainforth’s flower-shaped simulation of a chaotic attractor.

The winning images can be viewed online from today via the University’s website, along with other entries.

Electrospinning is a method of producing fibres with micrometer to nanometer-scale diameters. The fibres are especially interesting for tissue engineering applications, as the their sizes are similar to those of proteins and molecules found in cells. The electrospun fibres pictured are composed of polycaprolactone, a polymer that is commonly used in biomedical applications
