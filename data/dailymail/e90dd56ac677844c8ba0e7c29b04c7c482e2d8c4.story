Former Radio 1 DJ has been jailed for 13 years for a 20-year campaign of sex attacks on young boys

Former Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning has been jailed for 13 years for sex attacks on 24 boys over two decades.

The now-73-year-old - who was one of the founding presenters of the station - used drink, drugs and the 'allure' of his fame to groom his young victims.

One of the 40 indecent assaults  was said to have taken place at Jimmy Savile's house.

Judge Alistair McCreath told London's Southwark Crown Court the abuse was 'inappropriate and depraved'.

He added: 'It is not to be forgotten that all of this suffering was inflicted by you without thought for anything other than your own selfish pleasure.'

About a dozen of his victims - one of whom was as young as 10 when the attacks took place - sat at the back of court today, yards from their former tormentor, as the sentence was passed.

The prison term means Denning is the longest serving prisoner jailed after being arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, the police investigation set up in the wake of Savile scandal.

The court heard Denning, now of Basildon, Essex, took young boys out to watch Top Of The Pops recordings in the 1960s and 1970s.

The prolific paedophile began abusing the boys in 1967 - the same year he was unveiled as one of the founding DJs at Radio 1.

He moved to Dorset in the 1970s where he opened a computer games shop and used the 'exciting' technology to prey on boys and abuse them.

Denning used his print shop in Branksome, Dorset - where he kept a double bed - as a way of meeting youngsters.

Neil Moore, prosecuting, told London's Southwark Crown Court: 'The defendant used the allure first of the record industry and celebrity, and then the world of computer games, to entice boys into his company.

'He spoke to them about his career and the celebrities of the moment he knew. He offered them cigarettes, alcohol and drugs, bought them gifts and gave them money.

'He gave them access to pornographic material and gave them the means to do what they wanted in order to groom them. He took them to meals and took them to celebrity parties.

Mr Moore added: 'He would introduce them gradually to sexual material by suggesting sexual experimentation is natural. He would then move to sexually abuse them.

'Often a number of boys would be present at his home at the same time. And on a number of occasions he took pictures and videos of the boys.

'He always seemed to satisfy the parents that his motives were good and sound rather than indecent, as they were.'

One of his teenage victims told how Denning took him back to his home which was an 'Aladdin's Cave' of pornography.

Mr Moore told how Denning's singled out his victims at discos, skateparks and youth centres and plied some with the drug ecstasy..

He boasted of his 'huge record collection' and asked many of the boys back to his house to help catalogue them.

His victims initially thought Denning was kind and 'charismatic', but soon his 'kindness' would become abuse.

Mr Moore said Denning took one boy, aged 12 to 14, to watch Top of the Pops before repeatedly abusing him at his home.

He said: 'He described being given alcohol and said initially he found it exciting and mesmerising because the defendant would talk about all the famous people he knew such as Jimmy Savile.

'He would also take them out for meals, concerts and took them to a studio to see filmings of Top of the Pops.'

Other victims told how they were taken to celebrity parties where they met Savile and music mogul Jonathan King, who have both since been unmasked as sex offenders.

One of his victims was 14 or 15 when he was abused by Denning. He said it happened at Savile's home - although Savile is not said to have been involved.

The judge said Denning (pictured) had groomed his victims using alcohol, drugs and the allure of fame

Judge Alistair McCreath told Denning: 'You groomed all of these boys, they were for the most part in their early teens although some of them were younger.

'You used your own fame, your acquaintance with others who were famous, many of them now to be described more as notorious than as famous, your familiarity with the music industry, your possession of computers and computer games and other devices to win their trust and their misplaced admiration.

'You gave them alcohol and drugs. To some of them you gave money. You showed them pornographic material.

'You introduced them to inappropriate sexual behaviour by making it seem normal and exciting.

'In respect of some of them, you won the trust of their parents so that the boys were permitted to spend time, including overnight stays, at your home. You photographed some of them.

'On some occasions the sexual activity took place in the presence of other children.

'The effect on these boys, now men in their middle age has been, as is to be expected, devastating.

'At a critical stage in their development from childhood into adolescence, they were corrupted.'
