Charlie Green, now 18, has been sentenced to three years in a young offenders institution after stealing the ashes of a magistrate from his widow's home

A 'teenager from hell' has been detained for three years after stealing the ashes of a magistrate from his heartbroken widow's home.

Charlie Green, now 18, and an 17-year-old accomplice, who can't be named for legal reasons, targeted the widow's home during a burglary spree which saw them break-in to three homes in one night.

His victim Kathryn Gibson, 52, returned home to find an urn containing the remains of her late husband 
Robert had been snatched during a burglary at their home.

When police caught up with the 17-year old culprits both blamed their drink and drug crazed behaviour on being from broken homes with one claiming he had a 'communication disorder'.

It emerged the pair invaded three homes in just one night as people slept, driving off in two cars and crashing one.

Police recovered Mr Gibson’s ashes after the urn was found dumped on waste land 24 hours after the burglary spree.

The gang’s ringleader Green - otherwise known as Charlie Chipps - had already been dubbed a 'teenager from hell' near his home in Burnley, Lancashire, and had started smoking cannabis when he was 11.

He had already been given two anti-social behaviour orders after threatening residents - yet had ignored all the prohibitions. He has a string of convictions including violence, drugs, burglary and racially aggravated assault.

At Burnley Crown Court, Green, now 18, and a 17-year old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were sent to a Young Offender Institution for three years after they admitted aggravated burglary, burglary and theft.

An accomplice Joel Ludlum, 18, was locked away for 40 months after he admitted joining the pair on other burglaries. 

After the case Mrs Gibson, a retired 
NHS administrator whose 66-year old late husband, an ambulance 
technician, served as a JP in Blackburn and Accrington said: 'These 
teenagers are scum and I don’t think locking them up will deter them. 
Prison is too much of a luxury these days - so much so they are not 
being punished anymore.

'I’m sure they will be given a TV and a games console - and the taxpayer will be paying for that too.

'These lads have been in and out of trouble since god knows when and they obviously don’t care about anyone else except themselves.

'I personally blame the parents because these boys have got away with it from such a young age. I would love to know what their families think.

'If this case came up before my husband he would have been absolutely disgusted with these young lads. It is bad enough breaking into someone’s house but to take something like someone’s ashes should be unthinkable - even to a burglar.

'I don’t think they have any kind of conscience about what they have done. We know they don’t because after they burgled us they went on to burgle other people.

'If they were bothered they would have thought “what are we doing”. It is just like a job to them, they are not bothered about the distress and heartache their behaviour has caused to us and other people.'

Father-of-two Mr Gibson, who was married
to Kathryn for 32 years, had been a volunteer with St John Ambulance 
and after retiring became a driver for the elderly with the Dial-a-Ride.

He died of a heart attack in December last year, just days after he agreed to play Father Christmas at a local special school. He was cremated and his ashes were due to be scattered in his favourite part of the Scottish highlands.

The break-in occurred on April 20 when Green and his younger accomplice had a cocktail of alcohol and drugs. Both snatched the ashes after kicking in the back door of Mrs Gibson’s home while she was dropping off her daughter in Accrington.

Mrs Gibson added: 'When I came home the burglar alarm was making a different sound and when I walked through to the kitchen I saw the bottom panel of the back door had been kicked through with some force and they had kicked through the steel plate.

Accomplice: Joel Ludlam, who was not involved in the ashes theft but joined Green on other burglaries, was jailed for 40 months

'The laptops were there and the Wii and 
the DVDs and then I noticed the urn had gone which was next to the TV in
the hessian bag.

'I was in tears. I thought that when they realised what they were they would tip them out. We rang the police and they searched locally but couldn’t see anything. A neighbour said she had seen some lads jump over the wall with the bag.

'When Robert’s ashes were taken it was like losing him all over again. Everything was still very raw even though we were coming to terms with his death - yet when it happened it was so raw again.'

After the burglary Green and the 17-year-old, who was armed with a stick, terrified a young mother who found them in her home.

The victim, who had her two-month-old baby with her, barricaded herself into the lounge with the infant, while the pair made off with laptops, cameras and £1,270 cash.

The pair and Ludlam were also involved in two other burglaries one in which a Suzuki jeep was stolen and another in which a laptop, wallet and its contents were amongst the haul. In a third raid, the three teenagers stole a Rolex watch a Citroen Saxo.

The trio were caught on CCTV trying to disguise themselves and were arrested. Green had £635 on him and the 17-year-old had £590.

In mitigation Green’s lawyer Mark 
Stuart said the teenager had committed offences since the age of 12. He 
had been offered help from agencies like youth offending teams and 
social services, but he had resisted it.

The
barrister added: 'From the age of 11 to 18, he began to take as many 
drugs, of various natures, as he possibly could. It’s an appalling state
of affairs.'

In court: Burnley Crown Court was told how Green had been dubbed a teenager from hell and had a long list of previous convictions

Mr Stuart said: 'My client has a communication disorder and problems with social interaction. Undoubtedly he has had his difficulties and he had not helped himself, probably by the amount of drugs he had taken. That will have to stop or he will probably end up killing himself.'

Sentencing the judge Mr Recorder Peter Atherton said the burglaries had caused the victims much distress and unrecoverable financial loss.

He added: 'Their distress has been long-lasting. These have been major life events for them, which they will never forget and which will change their lifestyles adversely.'

The judge said the defendants had come from broken families, which had 'devastating consequences for them and for the victims of their many offences, committed through their childhoods and adolescence.'

He added: 'It’s had a great financial cost for society, placing heavy burdens on the courts and the caring services.'

After the ashes theft, Sgt Eugene Swift, from Lancashire Police had said: 'It’s obviously a callous act and has caused massive amounts of emotional upset to the victim.

'It was stupid and pointless, clearly there was no gain to be had from stealing ashes. They were completely thoughtless as to the effects this crime would have.'
