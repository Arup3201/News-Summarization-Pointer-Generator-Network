An unfit, overweight lorry driver has shed over 6st to become to complete a gruelling contest involving a two-and-a-half mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride followed by a full 26-mile marathon. And, to top it off, the former lonely heart has even found himself a fiancee. 

Steve Griffiths proposed to his girlfriend Jenny on the finishing line of the Ironman UK event which took place in Bolton.

The 50-year-old, from Handsacre, near Rugeley, got down on one knee after completing the marathon endurance and fitness test in 14 hours 22 minutes.

As a lorry driver Steve led a sedentary lifestyle and ate junk food for convenience on the road 

The two now plan to marry in New York on July 20 next year - exactly a year after his proposal at the end of his Ironman UK challenge.

Yet just four years before, Steve, a lorry driver, weighed over 20st and rarely exercised. Now he weighs a trim 13st 8lb.

He said: 'It was a fantastic moment. I planned to ask her to marry me if I completed the Iroman UK challenge. It was just the perfect moment to do it.

'I have been on quite a journey for the last four years and this was the climax. I was also turning 50 and I thought it was the right time to ask Jenny to marry me. Fortunately she said yes'

Steve, who has been going out with Jenny, aged 44, since March 2012, decided to transform his life after lack of fitness was starkly illustrated one one day while he was coaching a girls' football team.

Steve completed the Iron Man challenge, which involved Involved a two-and-a-half mile swim, 112 mile bike ride and a full 26-mile marathon, in 14 hours 22 minutes

He said: 'I was leading a pretty lazy lifestyle. I was a lorry driver who was wolfing down bacon sandwiches and fried breakfasts every day and doing very little exercise.

'I was coaching a young girls' local football team and one day I was shown up for being so unfit during the coaching session. I realised I had to do something about my weight.

'I started cycling and going to the gym and the weight started dropping off me. I lost 4st in the first four months.

'I ditched the fried breakfasts and fatty foods for cereal and for healthy options such as pasta and fish. Now I feel great.'

Steve also decided to turn his new love of exercise and healthy living into a career and trained to be a fitness instructor. He now works at Cannock Chase Leisure Centre.

During his four-year transformation he kept diaries and is now trying to get them published.

He added: 'I would love to inspire people who were in a similar position to me to achieve their goals and transform their lives.'
