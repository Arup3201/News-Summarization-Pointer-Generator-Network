Yesterday Frank Maloney, the tough-talking promoter and manager who guided boxer Lennox Lewis to become a boxing world champion, spoke out for the first time about a secret he'd been hiding his whole life.

She felt she was a woman trapped in a man's body and is currently undergoing gender reassignment, having changed her name to Kellie.

One person that knows only too well the struggle of living life as the wrong sex is Helen Wright, who lived for over 50 years as Alan, a 'macho man' desperate to be female. 

Opening up: In light of Frank Maloney's revelation that he is undergoing gender reassignment, Helen Wright, pictured, appeared on This Morning to tell her similar tale

After Alan's lies led her into a dark depression and suicide attempt, she realised that she had to be true to herself and for the past seven years has happily lived as Helen.

Speaking about how she empathises with Kellie on This Morning, Helen said the boxing promoter had been 'very brave' to speak out. 

She added of Kellie's plans for surgery: 'He's got to be 120 per cent certain that's what he wants because once the surgeons have done their work, there's no going back.'

Speaking about her own experience, Helen said: 'I kept it secret all my life. You have to be a macho to prove to yourself that these things that are happening shouldn't be there.'

Helen began to feel different at age of nine but refused to tell anyone what was going through her mind. 

Staying quiet: Helen worked as a truck driver and married a woman she met at school

Hiding a secret: Helen, pictured as Alan, knew there was something different about her from the age of nine but continued to live life as a man and even got married and had children

Coming out: One day Helen's wife found women's clothes in their house and Helen had to come clean but luckily she had a supportive network of friends

'From an early age I started dressing in girl's clothes and as it went on, in secret all the time, I would hide in the bathroom and hide clothes so nobody knew,' she said.

'When I hit my teens, I felt that there was something wrong and thought "Why should I be feeling like this? I'm a lad. It shouldn't be happening to me."'

Helen went on to live life as a man, working in the 'macho' industry of truck driving with her own haulage business. 

Helen even tied the knot with a woman she had met at school; they went on to be married for thirty years and had children and several grandchildren.

Happy at last: Speaking on This Morning, Helen said she feels happy and as though she's got a second bite of the cherry

'We had many happy years together. We had up and downs like everyone else,' said Helen of the marriage.

'However', she adds, 'the older I was getting, the worse I was becoming. The more and more Helen wanted to be there, Alan was getting shut out.'

One day, her wife found some women's clothes in their bedroom and she had to come clean. 

'She thought I was having an affair but I told her exactly what was what,' said Helen.

'We tried to talk about it but we could never really discuss it. It was at the point where it was never going to be accepted.'

When Helen told her parents, the shock, she says, was that they already knew.

Her greatest fight: Boxing promoter Frank Maloney, who guided fighter Lennox Lewis to the peak of the sport, is now living as a woman called Kellie, left

Helen, who says she never had any inkling of being gay, says she isn't doing this for love.

'I haven't done this because I wanted a man in my life, I've done this because of who I should've been from birth.

'There won't be men in Helen's life, I don't think. I'm not closed off to it, if I meet somebody, it would be companionship.'

Speaking about how coming out has changed her life, she added: 'I've got good friends, both male and female, who've all stuck by me. I had to do something about what happened to me, or I wouldn't be here.'

While she hasn't seen her grandchildren in the past year, she added: 'At the end of the day, it's my life, I've got to have a life. I'm happy now. I've got a second bite of the cherry.'
