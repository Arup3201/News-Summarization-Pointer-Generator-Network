Declared dead: The California court allowed Jahi McMath's parents to remove her from hospital and keep her alive elsewhere only after a coroner issued a death certificate

The family of a 13-year-old at the centre of a battle to turn off her life-support machine have ‘everything in place’ to move her from her hospital to a long term care facility, their laywer said today.

Christopher Dolan, who represents the relatives of Jahi McMath, said they had medical staff, transport and a new home for the teenager and were just about to ‘get it all in motion’.

He said that he was sure that Jahi would be transferred before a legal injunction runs out on Tuesday and that she would get the long term care her family wanted.

Jahi suffered complications following
 a routine operation to remove her tonsils at Children’s Hospital, in 
Oakland, California, on December 9.

They
 were so severe that her heart stopped, causing brain damage that the 
hospital said was so severe that she was effectively dead with no chance
 of survival if a respirator was turned off.

Three doctors and the court agreed she was brain dead and the hospital applied to turn off her life support machine.

The Alameda County Coroner has even issued a death certificate.

But
 all along her family, led by her mother Nailah and uncle Omari Sealey, 
have refused to accept the prognosis and argued there was still a chance
 she could recover.

They
 won an injunction preventing the hospital switching off life support 
and  agreed a ‘protocol’ with the hospital in which the teenager could 
be transferred while on a ventilator.

Devastated: Jahi's parents arrive at court Friday. They are fighting to keep their 13-year-old daughter alive after she was declared brain dead following complications in routine tonsil surgery

Devotion: Jahi's parents haven't left her bedside since the tragedy during a routine tonsil operation

‘We are in motion,’ Mr Dolan told KPIX 5 this morning.

‘We have what we need right now. I have everything in place I just need to get it moving.

‘I have a medical staff, I have the facilities, we have the transport, we just need to get it all in motion.’

He said that ‘come hell or high water’ Jahi would be moved before the deadline.

He
 said that important legal principles were at stake in the case, namely 
who had the right to decide on the future care of patients.

‘There are a lot of people on ventilators,’ he said.

‘Are
 we going to pull them all. Are we going to let the hospital decide. I 
am on the side of us deciding especially when there may have been 
negligence by the hospital to begin with.’

Hope: Jahi's family are certain that she will one day recover despite the hospital's insistence there is no chance of that happening
