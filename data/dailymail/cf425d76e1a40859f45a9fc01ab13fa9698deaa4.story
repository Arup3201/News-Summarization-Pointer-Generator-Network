Fewer than one in four voters think Ed Miliband will be prime minister in 2015, according to a new poll.

Just 22 per cent expect him to win the next election – the first in a series of unhappy findings for Mr Miliband after weeks of controversy over Labour’s links to the trades unions.

To add to Mr Miliband’s woes, his business spokesman Chuka Umunna, tipped as a future Labour leader, was reported last night to have started seeing Tony Blair regularly.

Bad reading: Only one in four people think Ed Miliband will be the next PM - rising star Chuka Umunna appears a more popular choice

‘Chuka strikes Tony as very smart,’ said one close ally of the former prime minister. Lord Mandelson, another architect of New Labour, added of Mr Umunna: ‘He’s on a trajectory which could take him far.’

According to a ComRes poll for ITV News, the majority of the British public – 57 per cent – do not see Mr Miliband as an election winner.

Twice as many – 42 per cent – agree that Labour would have a better chance in 2015 without him as the 20 per cent who disagree. With polls suggesting Britain may be on course for another hung parliament, 43 per cent said they would prefer another Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition to the 33 per cent who favour a Lib-Lab pact.

Almost half of voters, some 46 per cent, say that Labour cannot be trusted to run the economy, a figure that is unchanged from last year and suggests the party has made no headway on the key issue.

One crumb of comfort for Mr Miliband is that the public are slightly less likely to say that Labour would be more electable with David Miliband as its leader than they were last year. Some 31 per cent agree – down six points from last September.

Mr Umunna, hyped as the UK’s answer to Barack Obama, is one of several figures tipped as successors to Mr Miliband, including home affairs spokesman Yvette Cooper.

The Financial Times reported that having initially regarded Mr Umunna as too Left-wing, Mr Blair has started to see him regularly and believes he is ‘rising to the challenge’.

Lord Mandelson added: ‘I think he defies the Left-Right description. He’s part of a generation that transcends those labels.’
