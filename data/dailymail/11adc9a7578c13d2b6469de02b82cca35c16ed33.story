Roma held talks with Samuel Eto'o's representatives on Monday after completing the signing of his former Chelsea team-mate Ashley Cole.

The 33-year-old is a free agent after leaving Stamford Bridge and has offers from China and Turkey but is keen to return to Italy.

The meeting in Trigoria centred around whether Eto'o is willing to drop his wages to around Â£3million a year plus bonuses.

On the move: Cameroon forward Samuel Eto'o could be joining Roma

Released: He has been a free agent since leaving Chelsea at the end of last season

Welcome to Rome! He join former Chelsea team-mate Ashley Cole in the Italian capital

Should he move to the Italian capital, he would be re-united with left-back Cole who has signed a two-year deal with the club.

It would mean a return to Italy for the striker, following a trophy-laden spell at Inter Milan between 2009-11 - where he won the treble of Serie A, Coppa Italia and Champions League in 2010, and scored 53 goals in 101 games.

His most recent appearances came for Cameroon in a dismal World Cup display in Brazil this summer. Eto'o played in their 1-0 opening defeat at the hands of Mexico, but was injured for their subsequent losses against Croatia and Brazil as they finished bottom of Group A.
