In a bid to urge the Federal Aviation Administration to lift a
 ban currently preventing U.S. airlines from
 flying to Israel, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has flown to Tel Aviv in an effort to prove it is safe.

The ban was imposed after a Hamas rocket demolished a home near Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv and as airlines remain skittish following the downing of a passenger plane over Ukraine last week.

Bloomberg, echoing comments made by the Israel Government, said the decision to impose a ban was a victory for the terrorists.

Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg is urging the Federal Aviation Administration to lift a ban imposed on Tuesday which is currently preventing U.S. airlines from flying to Israel

To re-enforce his point, he announced that he would fly on El Al to Tel Aviv on Tuesday night to ‘show solidarity with the Israeli people and to demonstrate that it is safe to fly in and out of Israel.'

‘Ben Gurion is the best protected airport in the world and El Al flights have been regularly flying in and out of it safely,’ said Bloomberg.

‘The flight restrictions are a mistake that hands Hamas an undeserved victory and should be lifted immediately. I strongly urge the FAA to reverse course and permit US airlines to fly to Israel.’

When U.S. and European airlines quickly canceled flights to Israel on Tuesday, they showed both a skittishness and a new sense of urgency in dealing with global trouble spots following last week's downing of a passenger plane over Ukraine.

Delta Air Lines turned around one of its jets mid-flight and indefinitely canceled all future flights between the U.S. and Israel after a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip landed near Ben-Gurion Airport. 

Other U.S. airlines quickly took similar action, and counterparts in Europe and Canada followed within hours, despite protests from the Israeli government. Israeli airline El Al maintained its regular flight schedule.

The airlines were out ahead of aviation regulators in stopping service. The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a 24-hour ban on flights to Israel after the U.S. airlines acted.

Germany's Lufthansa, Italian airline Alitalia and Air France all acted before the European Aviation Safety Agency issued an advisory.

How long the cessation of flights will last is unclear. U.S. airlines now must wait for the FAA, which said it will provide updated guidance by midday Wednesday.

Aviation and legal experts said that airlines are now taking risk assessment into their own hands, both for the safety of passengers and to avoid claims of negligence, following last week's Malaysia Airlines disaster.

Major airlines have moved quickly to cancel services to Israel’s main air hub – Ben Gurion International in Tel Aviv – in light of yesterday’s attack, with saw a rocket land a mile from the airport.

The incident comes at a time of heightened tension within the air industry following last week’s downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine by an apparent missile strike.

The latest information is as follows:

America’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a statement yesterday in response to the rocket attack, informing all American carriers that they are ‘prohibited from flying to or from Israel’s Ben Gurion International Airport for a period of up to 24 hours… in response to a rocket attack which landed approximately one mile’ from the airport. The ban will run until 12:15 EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) today – 5.15pm UK time – but may be extended for a further period.

Delta re-routed yesterday’s Flight 468 – which had been due to land in Tel Aviv – to Paris. The airline has announced that it ‘has suspended service until further notice to and from Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv and its New York-JFK hub. Delta, in coordination with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, is doing so to ensure the safety and security of our customers and employees.’

British Airways is still operating to Ben Gurion International. Its two daily flights to Tel Aviv from London Heathrow are still on the schedule. Its 08:50 service took off late, and is currently en route. Its 22:30 service is still due to depart as listed.

The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) says it ‘strongly recommends’ that airlines should avoid operating in and out of Tel Aviv.

Easyjet has announced that it ‘is suspending its services to and from Tel Aviv for 24 hours, and, as a result, will not be operating Luton/Tel Aviv/Luton and Basel/Tel Aviv/Basel flights on Wednesday 23 July.’

Air France and KLM have suspended flights to Israel. A statement says that ‘Air France has decided to suspend flights to Tel Aviv until further notice. Air France's security department is closely monitoring local developments in real time. The safety of our passengers and our crews remains our top priority.’

Lufthansa, Germanwings and Austrian Airlines yesterday announced two-day suspensions of flights to Israel.

Air Canada and Alitalia have cancelled flights to Israel.

'Most airlines have security departments that try to evaluate those sorts of risk,' said William Waldock, a professor of safety science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

'Some do it better than others, but I would expect that everyone is on a very heightened sense of alert right now.'

Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group, said airlines might be more proactive about avoiding hot spots, although he noted that there are very few areas where non-government militaries have weapons sophisticated enough to shoot down a plane.

The Israel government felt the airlines overreacted Tuesday. The Transportation Ministry called on the companies to reverse their decision, insisting Ben-Gurion Airport is safe and completely guarded and saying there is no reason to 'hand terror a prize,' by halting the flights.

Palestinian militants have fired more than 2,000 rockets toward Israel, and several heading toward the area of the airport have been intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defense system, but police spokeswoman Luba Samri said Tuesday's landing was the closest to the airport since fighting began on July 8.
