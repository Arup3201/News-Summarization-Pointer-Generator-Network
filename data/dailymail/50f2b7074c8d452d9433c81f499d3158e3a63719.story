Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes has revealed he played one of the seven dwarfs during the club's pantomime show when he was an apprentice.

United's youth players put on a festive show for the senior stars in the run up to Christmas when Scholes was a teenager.

Scholes, writing in his column for the Independent, was joined by team-mates Gary Neville, David Beckham and Nicky Butt for the Christmas production.

'At Manchester United there is an old Christmas tradition that the apprentices – as we were known in my teenage years – put on a pantomime show for the first team full of jokes at the expense of the senior players,' revealed Scholes.

'You could say it was a formative experience for me: I was one of the seven dwarfs. When I look back at it, the other dwarfs included Gary Neville, David Beckham and Nicky Butt, although sadly I cannot recall which of us was Dopey.

'The point of the exercise was to make a bit of a fool of yourself in front of your team-mates, no bad thing when it comes to breaking down the insecurities and rivalries in a group of teenage boys. We also loved the wicked jokes about the first-team players.

'That tradition continued right up to my retirement and I always enjoyed the reaction on the faces of some of the biggest names at United when they realised it was them being sent up by the young lads.'

Scholes also backed Manchester City to beat Barcelona in the last 16 of the Champions League and stated his belief that Chelsea, who face Paris Saint-Germain, have the most difficult tie of the round.

He added: 'I am tipping Manchester City to eliminate Barcelona from the Champions League over two legs. Chelsea have the hardest draw to my mind.'
