Double murderer: convicted murderer Patrick C. Daniel allegedly planned to escape from prison

Muskegon Correctional Facility workers have foiled the escape plot of a former Ann Arbor man convicted of two murders.

President Tom Tylutki of the Michigan Corrections Organization says corrections officers at the Muskegon facility discovered Patrick C. Daniel’s, 44, plans to escape from a medium-security unit on Wednesday. 

Daniel was is a medium-security unit for 'good behavior.' 

Tylutki says homemade items, including maps of West Michigan, a compass, two flashlights and a yarn rope were found in the man’s cell.

The Muskegon Chronicle reports a prison uniform painted white, additional clothing and packaged food also was found in the cell.

During a search of the prison auditorium, corrections officers discovered items that could have been used as weapons.

A Michigan Department of Corrections spokesman says Daniel was placed in segregation after the discoveries. He says the Michigan State Police is investigating.

'We have some very alert staff who foiled what appeared to be a planned escape,' said MDOC spokesman Chris Gautz. 

'We're very appreciative, and we really want to commend the staff who found what they found and derailed this plan.'

Tylutki claims that a corrections officer was making rounds Wednesday morning in the prison yard and while looking a garbage bin found a prisoners uniform that had been painted black.

The uniform led  officers to Daniel's cell, where they later found the other items.

Patrick Daniel, who was arrested in Utah, was convicted in the deaths of of 35-year-old Robert Stanley Bilton Jr. in September 2001 and of his girlfriend 31-year-old Becky Britton in March 2002, whose body also was found in his car.

The bodies were found after Daniel was pulled over March 14 in Sevier County, Utah, for a missing license plate. 

Police  said Daniel hired Bilton at a Detroit rehabilitation center and homeless shelter. Daniel promised to pay him $10 an hour to be a caretaker for an apartment complex, they said.

Several days later, Bilton, of Dearborn, was dead.

He had been strangled, his body wrapped in plastic and stuffed into the trunk of a car.

Police also found the frozen and dismembered body of Britton, Daniel's former girlfriend.

Authorities suspect Daniel was trying to steal Bilton's identity.

Police found Bilton's empty wallet in the basement of Daniel's Ann Arbor condominium, according to court records. 

Daniel had a copy of a birth certificate and Bilton's Social Security number. The two men also had similar physical characteristics, police said.

Daniel is being held in the Washtenaw County Jail without bond. A preliminary exam was set for July 3.
