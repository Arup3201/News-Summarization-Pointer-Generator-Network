Will Sharman continued his impressive form ahead of the Commonwealth Games with another quick time - even if he lost out in a three-way photo finish in the 110 metres hurdles at Horse Guards Parade on Sunday.

Running on a purpose-built track in the shadow of Whitehall and St James' Park at the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games, the 29-year-old, who is in the form of his life after twice running a personal best of 13.21 seconds this summer, clocked 13.24secs into a slight headwind.

The bad news was it was only good enough for third, Sharman just edged out by American World Championship silver medallist Ryan Wilson, who was credited with the win, and Shane Brathwaite from Barbados, with all three given the same time.

But he took the scalp of Olympic champion and world record holder Aries Merritt, while the time maintained Sharman's hugely encouraging recent run, which has most notably included a victory over world number one and Commonwealth rival Hansle Parchment of Jamaica at Hampden Park last weekend.

Sharman, the Commonwealth silver medallist four years ago, told Press Association Sport: "The times I am running on average now would get medals at all of the championships.

'Before it would take a World Championship final for me to run a personal best, now I'm doing them in rain, hail or shine.

'I'm running quicker than I do in the finals. So hopefully, given the way I've been operating in the past, when the final comes I lift my game and step up again.

'That's what I'm working towards, making my average time much faster so, even if I get to the final and have a bad race, we can come away with something.'

Horse Guards Parade was used memorably for beach volleyball at London 2012 and staged jousts during the reign of Henry VIII, but Paralympic champion Jonnie Peacock came off second best again in his tussle with American Richard Browne.

Beaten in Glasgow last weekend, Peacock had to settle for second place once more as he continued his comeback from injury.

In the absence of compatriot and Olympic champion Greg Rutherford, who pulled out as a precaution following a knee problem, Chris Tomlinson claimed long jump victory with 7.94m.

Allyson Felix responded to a storming start from Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce to win the 100m, bursting through in the second half of the race to beat her Jamaican rival, the two-time reigning Olympic champion, into second, although a faulty clock meant she was unable to find out her time.

There were also victories for Paralympic champions Hannah Cockroft in the T34 100m and Aled Davies in the F42 shot put, London 2012 silver medallist Stef Reid in the F42/44 long jump and world champion Sophie Hahn in the T37/38 100m.
