The new Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Britain's relationship with the EU was 'not acceptable'

Britain will vote to leave the European Union if Brussels does not hand back powers to Westminster, Philip Hammond said this morning.

The new Foreign Secretary said the current relationship with Brussels was 'not acceptable' and needed to be overhauled before giving the public a say in 2017.

But he added: 'If the offer by European partners is nothing, no change, no negotiation, I am pretty clear what the answer of the British people in that referendum is going to be.'

Mr Hammond has previously said he would vote to leave the EU under the current circumstances.

The Foreign Secretary was asked whether he stood by his earlier position that Britain should vote to leave an unreformed EU.

He said: 'The status quo is not in Britain’s interest and we have to negotiate - the way we’re doing this, if we have a Conservative government after the next election, there will be a referendum in 2017 so the British people will decide.'

The Foreign Secretary added: 'There has to be substantive renegotiation, substantive change in Europe, that addresses the concerns that Britain has, but also addresses the needs of Europe in a modern world and then we’ll put it to the British people and they’ll make the decision.

'My job now is to pursue that renegotiation… when we get to the end of that process and we can see what is on offer, what is on the table, we will then make our recommendation to the British people.

'I haven’t change my mind. If there is no change at all in the way Europe is governed, no change in the balance of competencies between the nation states and the European Union, no resolution of the challenge of how the Eurozone can succeed and co-exist with the non-Eurozone, that is not a Europe that can work for Britain in the future so there must be change, there must be renegotiation.'

The Foreign Secretary insisted Britain was not alone in its fight to reform the EU. He said: 'Increasingly, across the European Union people are realising that Europe needs reform'

Mr Hammond also insisted that Britain was not alone in wanting reform in Europe.

He said: 'We all believe that the status quo is not an acceptable way to run Europe in the future. And we are not isolated as some people wish to paint us, as little Englanders, alone in believing this.

'Increasingly, across the European Union people are realising that Europe needs reform.

'It needs reform to deal with the globalisation, the world economic situation, it needs reform to deal with the challenge of a Eurozone coexisting with the non-Eurozone countries in the world. And it needs reform to deal with Britain’s specific grievances.'
