As a flash flood raged down a Colorado highway and swept dozens of cars away, one driver caught on tape his wild ride down a river of mud.

John Schroyer was among those stranded by the relentless, black water after the devastating Black Forest fires left water with nowhere else to go but down a mountain road after a storm Wednesday.

At least 25 drivers were left stranded in on highway 24 in Manitou Springs, but only Schroyer caught his terrifying experience on video.

Cars littered a four-mile stretch road and traffic was brought to a halt after an everyday storm near a scar left by wildfires turned into something totally out of the ordinary.

‘I was driving up 24, and it wasn't raining that hard, and then all of a sudden, cars just started stopping in front of me,’ Schroyer told the Colorado Springs Gazette, where he happens to be the video editor.

What would have been a dream moment for some journalists became a nightmare as Schroyer quickly became his own subject.

‘I looked down for a minute, and when I glanced back up, a giant black wave of mud slammed into my car,’ he said.

'Oh my god!': Schroyer was overtaken by the waters, which came down the road all at once, washing out the highway for three hours

The dutiful Schroyer continued taking footage as a drive in his Subaru became a flume ride.

Whisked from side to side without coming to a halt, Schroyer’s car smashed into the side of the mountain and into light poles repeatedly.

Muddy waters splashed onto his windshield as he tried to keep steering through the onslaught before finally coming to a halt in the middle of the waters.

‘The flood waters kept going and going, and I was stuck in my car for probably half an hour,’ he said.

Eventually, Schroyer was able to climb atop his car, as bystanders and fellow stranded drivers stood by helplessly, and then leap to solid ground.

Despite the unbelievable footage, no injuries were reported following the flood, though Highway 24 was completely shut down for three hours.

Stuck: Cars were tossed down a four-mile stretch Wednesday. On Thursday, teams with snow plows began digging out cars that remained stuck

An area church became a shelter for those left stranded on the side of the road as thunderstorm warnings continued into the evening.

According to the National Weather Service, the flooding was the result of both the recent devastating Black Forest fire and last year’s Waldo Canyon fire.

Homes in the area, after so many were lost to the fires that contributed to the flood, were nonetheless all spared any damage, authorities said.

‘I think the lesson learned here is that this was a demonstration of the speed and the power in which that water can move,’ El Paso County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lt. Jeff Kramer said. ‘Be very aware of the weather forecast and weather in the area,’ he said, ‘and be mindful of the dangers that we're going to continue to face from the threat of flash flooding up in that area.’
