Phil Neville has described David Moyes traumatic reign as Manchester United manager as an 'absolute disaster'.

Neville, a graduate of the lauded Class of '92, was hired by Moyes as his first-team coach last summer and he witnessed the disintegration unfold before his very eyes.

United slumped to the club's worst finish in 24 years, ending the season in 7th place in the Barclays Premier League table amid a chorus of disapproval from the Old Trafford crowd.

Hard year: Phil Neville said last season was a disaster for Manchester United under David Moyes

Terrible time: Moyes guided United to seventh in the league despite joining the club as they were champions

When speaking on BBC's Test Match Special, Neville said: 'I was involved last year and it was an absolute disaster from start to finish. We must all take responsibility, not just David Moyes. I take responsibility and so does everyone involved.'

Neville, who continued to work with the first-team as part of Ryan Giggs' backroom staff when Moyes was sacked in April, has now left the club following a summer of uncertainty.

Neville will work as a BBC pundit on Match of the Day but he harbours little resentment towards United and he has even tipped Louis van Gaal to lead the club to the Premier League title.

'I think we’re going to win the league. I’m sure that’s what Louis van Gaal will be saying to the players because second isn’t any good at Manchester United.

'We’ve got a great chance this year because there’s no European football. 

'It’s about regrouping and all the lads have come back for pre-season and look like they’re ready to win the league again.'

Neville also remains on good terms with lifelong friend Giggs, who has remained at the club as Van Gaal's assistant manager.

When a fan asked who the best player he had played with was, Neville joked: 'Giggsy. And he's just sacked me as well!'

Fresh start: Louis van Gaal will hope to perform a little better than his predecessor at Old Trafford this year
