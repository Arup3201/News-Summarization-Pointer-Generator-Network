A couple born in beds next to each other on the same day in the same hospital ended up getting married - and will next week celebrate their 60th birthdays together.

Dave O'Callaghan and Jane Hammond were both born at the Mowbray Maternity Hospital in Exeter, Devon - which has since closed - on January 26, 1955, but didn't meet again until they were 17.

The pair soon fell in love and were engaged at 21, before marrying the next year. 

Dave O'Callaghan and Jane Hammond were born in beds next to each other on the same day in the same Exeter hospital and later got married; on Monday the pair celebrate their 60th birthdays together

The couple, of Exeter, Devon, have been married for 38 years and are celebrating their joint birthday on Monday.They have two children, Lydia, 29, and Imogen, 25.

Ms Hammond said the biggest advantage of their parallel existence is that they never forget each other's birthdays.

When she asked her husband-to-be's birthday, as first 'I didn't believe him', but the couple have 'never really made much of it'.

However, she acknowledges that being 'born in the same hospital on the same day and in the same year is a bizarre coincidence'.

'People are very surprised when we tell them our story. Their reactions make us realise how rare and special it is.

The couple didn't meet until they were 17 as they grew up on opposite sides of Exeter, but they soon fell in love and were engaged at 21; the couple are pictured above on their wedding day the following year

Ms Hammond, pictured above at just 11 months old, said her and Mr O'Gallaghan had 'never made much' of their back story, but admitted being born on the same day at the same hospital was 'quite unusual'

'The same day, the same year and the same hospital is quite unusual.'

Ms Hammond, who is about three hours older than her husband, she the pair never met growing up as they lived on opposite sides of Exeter.

The couple met after Mr O'Callaghan started seeing a friend of his wife-to-be.

Ms Hammond, who works at the student health clinic at Exeter University, said of their first meeting: 'He was more interested in me than I was in him. I was invited to his 18th birthday party - as I wasn't really celebrating mine.

'My friend that he was seeing came up and told me 'it is not me he wants, it is you.'

'We got together about a month later and things developed from there.'

Mr O'Callaghan, who has run a hairdressing business for 30 years, said of his relationship: ''We have had a really good life together and we have two lovely girls.'

The couple will celebrate their joint birthday with a large gathering of family and friends.
