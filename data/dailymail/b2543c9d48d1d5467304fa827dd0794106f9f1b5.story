A survivor of the apparent massacre of dozens of students in Mexico has told of his narrow escape from the gang of corrupt police officers and drug cartel hit men who ambushed them.

State prosecutors believe more than 40 students who went missing last month after a violent clash with officers on the outskirts of Iguala were rounded up, killed and thrown in mass graves. 

One of those who escaped said the students were travelling in buses which they had seized for a protest when they were blocked by a police car.

The 19-year-old, who wants to be known as Eusebio for fear of reprisals, said the officers then opened fire as the students got off the buses, killing at least one and injuring several others.

'The shooting carried on for a long time, he told Global Post.

'More police arrived and were firing at us. I lay down in the back of the bus.'

Then, after ambulances and journalists appeared at the scene, he said more officers arrived with gunmen in plain clothes, later identified by prosecutors as members of a ruthless gang of assassins who work for the Beltran Leyvan Cartel.

As more shots rang out, some officers began bundling the students into the back of patrol cars, at first giving the impression they were rescuing them.

But Eusebio said: 'They were hitting the students as they took them. People were also scared about being shot so they gave themselves up.

'They thought they would just be arrested. But something else awaited them.'

Sensing things were seriously amiss, Eusebio ran to safety - and later found out that his intuitions had saved his life.

When the students reassembled back in at his University in Tixtla, there were 43 missing and it is now believed they were executed after the ambush.

Guerrero's attorney general, Inaky Blanco, said on Sunday that 28 bodies have been found at burial sites so far, and it is 'probable' that some of the missing  students are among the remains found.

Mexican President
Enrique Peña Nieto vowed on Monday to hunt down those
responsible for the apparent massacre that authorities say involved local
security officials. 

He said the motive of the killings was unclear.

Other local officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told Reuters that at least 34 bodies have been discovered.

In his first comments on the incident, Peña Nieto said the
federal government would identify those behind the massacre and
make sure they face justice.

'We need to find the truth and make sure the law is applied
to those responsible for these outrageous, painful and
unacceptable acts,' he said in a four-minute-long televised
statement. 

He did not take questions.  

Blanco said on Sunday that two gang hitmen have admitted
killing 17 of the missing students with the help of security
officials.

The likelihood of official involvement creates a major
headache for Peña Nieto, who has sought to shift attention away
from Mexico's gangland violence and onto a batch of economic
reforms he has driven through Congress.

Angel Aguirre, the governor of Guerrero state, said he was
certain the students were killed by gangs in cahoots with the
police.

He added that he expected at least some of the bodies in
the mass grave would be those of the students, but said tests
still needed to be completed to make sure.

'It could well be them, I don't rule it out, it's a very
real possibility,' Aguirre, who has been criticized for not
doing enough to clean up the state and keep a lid on the rampant
violence, said in a radio interview.

Some 22 local police have been arrested in connection with
the violent incidents in Guerrero.

The fugitive mayor of Iguala, Jose Luis Abarca, is also
being investigated for possible involvement in the crimes, as is
the head of security for Iguala.

Blanco said the leader of a local gang known as the
Guerreros Unidos conspired with security officials to carry out
the killings.

Peña Nieto took office two years ago pledging to end a wave
of violence that has killed around 100,000 people since the
start of 2007. 

Though homicides have fallen on his watch, other
crimes have increased, including extortion and kidnapping.

Guerrero, which is also home to the resort of Acapulco, has
been one of the most lawless states in Mexico for years.
