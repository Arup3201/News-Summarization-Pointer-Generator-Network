Wine connoisseurs may be prepared to pay hundreds of pounds for rare bottles stowed in French chateaus for decades, but for most people supermarket plonk has to do.

Now there’s a gadget that claims to make cheap wine taste better, by accelerating the ageing process using high frequency sound waves.

The Sonic Decanter, which is yet to be launched, will use ultrasound to 'age' bargain bottles in just 20 minutes by altering the compounds in the wine and make it more drinkable.

A good vintage? The Sonic Decanter (pictured) claims to make cheap wine taste better, by accelerating the ageing process using high frequency sound waves

Its Seattle, Washington-based makers say the high frequency sound waves improve flavour by breaking down preservatives, softening tannins and releasing aromas not normally found in young wine.

The gadget relies on patented technology that uses ultrasound to change the molecular and chemical structure of wine to make it taste smoother and more intense. 

Usually such an ageing process takes years for molecules to change due to the interaction between each other, but ultrasound forces these reactions to happen faster, changing their properties and the taste of the wine.

To use the gadget, people will have to pour water into the base then place a bottle of wine inside it.

They will then press a button on the gadget - or a smartphone app - to say whether the wine if white, red or rose.

They can choose a suitable time to 'age' the wine by setting the timer.

The device takes 20 minutes or less to change the molecular and chemical structure of wine, using ultrasound.

This will bring out aromas usually only associated with vintage wines, soften tannins and enhance the wine's flavour, the company claims.

The company writes on its Kickstarter page: ‘When used on wine the [ultrasound] Sonic Decanter promotes further extraction of flavours, aromas and mouth feel from interactions among phenolics and anthocyanins (types of additives and pigments) and which results in smoother more integrated mouth feel and a smooth, flavourful lingering finish. ‘

The device allows for a more energetic reaction between the molecules and therefore a more complete molecular change, it explained.

Natural gases such as oxygen and sulphur dioxide are expelled from the bottle, giving it a longer shelf life.

‘This results in an improvement in taste, aroma, mouth feel and an overall enjoyment in the wine drinking experience,’ the company claims.

Users of the gadget will be able to operate it using a smartphone app and Bluetooth connection, as well as buttons on the gadget, so they can run the device for a specific time to create a wine that suits their palette.

The Sonic Decanter will ‘age’ a rose, Sauvignon Blanc or Chardonnay for around 10 minutes, to release extra flavours, while Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah can take twice that long.

It can also be used to ‘reinvigorate’ previously opened and re-corked bottles of wine, its inventors say.

The launch of the Sonic Decanter is planned for June next year and it's available to pre-order on Kickstarter from $129 (£82).
