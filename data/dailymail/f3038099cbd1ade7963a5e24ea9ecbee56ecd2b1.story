These are America's real-life haunted houses -  abandoned properties which provided the backdrop for such bloody and brutal histories they cannot be sold. 

The series of photos were taken by Seph Lawless his new book 13: An American Horror Story.

All the houses in his book are empty and have provided the backdrop for murders and suicides as well as creepy happenings.

Lawless told Slate he found entering the homes 'terrifying' but not due to their past: 'I'm more concerned with my reality of being attacked by derelicts, murderers or criminals that often inhabit these places.'

But he admitted that in some of the buildings he did see and hear things he could not explain. 

For example in one house featured in the book, doors slammed violently shut, seemingly of their own accord. 

In Detroit, Lawless, who promotes his work via a Facebook page, saw 'what appeared to be a pool of blood' in the corner of a room.

Lawless said it was only when he was editing the images on his computer that he noticed 'shadowy figures hiding behind objects in the photo'

'It was more than likely someone in the house was hiding there after I had entered. There's no way for me to know now since I didn't edit the images until weeks later.'
