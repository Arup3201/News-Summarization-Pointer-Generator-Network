A FedEx tractor-trailer truck was already in flames when it crossed a median and slammed into a bus carrying students in Northern California, witnesses say.

The truck clipped a car occupied by a couple before it slammed into the bus on Thursday evening, killing 10 people - five high school students, three chaperones and the drivers of both vehicles.

More than 30 people, mostly teenagers, were taken to local hospitals.

Bonnie Duran CNN affiliate KOVR she was driving with her husband made a quick decision to swerve and avoid a direct hit from the truck.

'Somehow we survived,' she said.

Mrs Duran told the network she is sure the truck was on fire as it crossed the median strip toward them.

The crash occurred on Interstate 5 in Orland, which cuts through the heart of California's farming country about 90 miles north of Sacramento.

The students were traveling in three buses from the Los Angeles area to take part in a program at Humboldt State University - which allows prospective attendees to visit the campus - and represented 21 southern California high schools.

The two other buses in the caravan made it to the university.

Among those killed were an LA man and the woman he proposed to in December.

A 17-year-old twin was also among the confirmed dead, while her twin sister was in one of the other buses, NBC Los Angeles reported.

Another student, Adrian Castro, 18, has also been identified among those that perished.

He was a senior at El Monte High School who played on the school's fottball team

Michael Myvett, 29, and his fiancee Mattison Haywood were serving as chaperones on the bus.

Marisa Serrato, 17, was also confirmed among the dead.

Her twin, Marisol Serrato, was on a different bus that wasn't involved in the crash and made it safely to the school on Friday.

Marisol was accepted to Humboldt State
 University, while Marisa was waitlisted there. The two Norte Vista High
 School seniors decided to check out the campus.

'My
 sisters are real religious, smart, A students,' Miguel Serrato said. 
'They were going to get their high school diploma; they were looking 
toward the future.'

Myvett had given Haywood her engagement ring outside the Louvre art museum in Paris on Christmas Day, said his employers at the Center for Autism and Other Disorders in Torrance.

He had provided therapy for autistic children for the last two years.

He was 'able to connect with our kids on a level few others could, and he contributed to their wellbeing in such a positive and profound way,' the center's operations manager Kyle Farris said in a statement.

'Adrian Castro will be missed as a student and football player,' El Monte football coach Joel Sanchez told the Press-Telegram. 'He was a good young man with a bright future. He will always be remembered by the El Monte family.'

Although Castro was not a star football player, Raul Castro said his son always pushed himself.

'He was stubborn,' Mr. Castro said. 'When he wanted to do something, he applied himself until he finished it.'

Humboldt State recruiter Arthur Arzola, was identified earlier Friday.
