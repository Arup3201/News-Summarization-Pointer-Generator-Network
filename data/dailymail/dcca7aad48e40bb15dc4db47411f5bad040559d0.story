A new report has found that the generation of Australians who are currently 24 or under will be the first that are worse off than their parents  

More expensive houses, fewer jobs and less help from the government - that's the bleak future facing Australians under 24.

A new report from the Foundation for Young Australians has found that although the country's youngest generation is more educated and likely to live longer than their ancestors, they're unlikely to have it better than their parents and are predisposed to higher debts and instability, the ABC reports.

Almost a third of young people are currently unemployed or under-employed and those who went to university are saddled with $24,000 more debt than their parents.

To buy a first home they have to take out loans three times larger than did their parents.

New official figures also released on Monday show the average loan for a first home buyer hit a record $310,200 in September.

That compares with just $67,500 in 1991, yet average wages have not grown anywhere near the same pace.

The proportion of people under 24-years-old working part-time only is three times what it was 30 years ago.

By 2050 it's predicted the amount of government spending that directly benefits young people will drop from 46 per cent of total expenditure to 37 per cent.

At the same time, spending on older Australians will increase.

Young Australians are well aware of the challenges ahead - fewer than one in four believe their life experience will be better than that of their parents.

Jan Owen, the CEO of the Foundation for Young Australians which released the report, said that the longer the needs of young people are ignored, the 'bigger and uglier' future economic problems  are going to get

Foundation chief executive Jan Owen says young Australians are the country's social and economic lifeblood.

'We must ensure that we are investing in them today to secure Australia's tomorrow,' she said ahead of the report's launch.

The longer the needs of young people are ignored, their potential discounted, and their talents and energy wasted, the 'bigger and uglier' the future economic problems of our nation are going to get.

The Renewing Australia's Promise report will be launched in Melbourne on Monday.
