Headteachers should be forced by the Government to publish their salaries to prevent a looming ‘dash for cash’, a union said yesterday.

The NASUWT has attacked the inflation of leadership pay deals, which has seen a record rise in six-figure wages.

It wants heads to come under the same scrutiny as council chiefs or quango bosses to prevent abuse of taxpayers’ money.

A teaching union warns rising headteacher salaries are diverting funds away from the classroom

Some 900 school leaders are paid at least £100,000 including 300 who take home £110,000 or more, according to recent Department for Education figures.

Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, yesterday warned that the Government’s overhaul of leadership pay could lead to further large increases.

Changes giving governors more flexibility over the awarding of heads’ salaries are being introduced this September.

This means they will have greater freedom to ‘rubber stamp’ requests from school leaders for their performance-related rises, Miss Keates warned.

But restricted school budgets could lead to less cash being available for the wages of classroom teachers.

Miss Keates said the union was ‘very concerned’ about a possible ‘dash for cash’ from head teachers at the beginning of the autumn term.

She said: ‘We’re being extremely vigilant and are preparing ourselves during the summer term for what we think is going to be considerable casework in schools and possibly escalation of (industrial) action at school level where we find that schools have depressed teachers’ salary for arbitrary reasons but headteachers’ salary is increasing.

‘More and more power is being delegated to governing bodies, many of whom, of course, rubber stamp what head teachers say.’

She added: ‘This is public money and our view is there’s a very quick way to resolve this. All the Government has to do is stop exempting headteachers from not having to publish their salaries annually.

‘Every other senior executive in the public sector is required to publish their salary annually, except headteachers. Public money should not be changing hands behind closed doors.’

It emerged earlier this month that one in four secondary school heads now earns at least £100,000, with some receiving almost double that amount.

An annual census of the school workforce - published by the Department for Education - showed that 600 heads earned between £100,000 and £109,999 and 300 took home more than £110,000.

Prime Minister£142,500

NHS Consultant£75,249 - £101,451

Principal Crown Advocate for CPS£70,271 - £80,747

Member of Parliament£67,060

CoE Diocesan Bishops£40,600

Police sergeant£36,519 - £41,040

Station manager in Fire Service£36,365 - £40,109

Teacher (outside London)£34,523 - £37,124

NHS Nurse Team Manager£30,764 - £40,558

Paramedic£21,176 - £27,625

All were secondary heads - 600 at academies and 300 at council-operated schools. Two years ago, 700 were on six figures.

However, the figures may under-estimate the actual number of large pay packets because another 600 leadership salaries were recorded as ‘misreported’.

Earlier this year, the School Teachers’ Review Body, which makes recommendations to the government on teacher salaries and working conditions, said Education Secretary, Michael Gove, had sought ‘maximum discretion’ for governing bodies in setting head teachers’ pay.

Outlining its reforms, the STRB said it was providing ‘formal headroom at the top of the pay range to incentivise and reward heads taking on some of the largest and most challenging leadership roles’.

It added: ‘Schools are now free to make differentiated, performance-based progression awards to classroom teachers; and have local discretion to pay a higher salary to the very best teachers. We believe similar flexibilities should apply to pay of school leaders.’

Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said yesterday: ‘I am not in favour of publishing individual heads’ salaries because they already have some of the most exposed, scrutinised roles in the public sector.’

A spokesman for the Department for Education said: 'It’s essential we have the best people in place to lead our schools if we are to raise standards. That’s why decisions on pay are down to schools so that they can recruit and retain the highest calibre of school leaders. We are also giving schools the freedom to reward classroom teachers who get the best out of their pupils.

'Academies already publish the salary bands of all teaching staff earning over £50,000. We have accepted the recommendations of the School Teachers Review Body to provide clear guidelines around how governing bodies should decide on headteachers' pay.'
