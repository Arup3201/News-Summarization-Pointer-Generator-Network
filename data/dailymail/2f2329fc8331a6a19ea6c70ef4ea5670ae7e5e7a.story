Sonny Bill Williams may miss the birth of his first child, pledging to remain on tour with the All Blacks for the next month even if his wife goes into labour.

The former NRL player is set to make his return to international rugby, named at inside centre for Saturday's tour-opening Test against the US in Chicago.

With his wife Alana Raffie expecting their first child in two to three weeks' time, coach Steve Hansen confirms that SBW has confirmed his commitment to the tour, regardless of his child's imminent birth.

Williams' teammate Charlie Faumuina's wife Rachelle is also heavily pregnant with the couple's second child.

'Both of them (Williams and Faumuina) are staying on the tour regardless of whether the baby comes early or the baby comes late,' Hansen told NZ Newswire.

Hansen has always maintained there is no protocol for All Blacks fathers-in-waiting.

Players make their own decision about whether to attend the birth of their children, with a number having missed Tests in recent seasons for that reason.

On Instagram three months ago, Williams referred to his wife as 'mumsy', but has never officially confirmed that they are expecting their first child

SBW and Ms Raffie married in a secret ceremony in August last year. Seven months ago, Williams posted this photo to his Instagram account of the couple's movie night, again referring to his beautiful wife as 'mumsy'

The family-oriented man's Instagram is filled with photographs of himself with children, making his desire for a family no secret with the caption: 'this is what makes me happy'

This year, centre Conrad Smith skipped August's drawn Test against Australia in Sydney, then hooker Dane Coles flew home from Argentina a month ago.

Both watched the birth of their first children, two boys.

Williams has signed a two-year deal with the New Zealand Rugby Union and Waikato Chiefs from 2015, but the NZRU were keen to get him back in a black jersey quickly as he reaccustomed himself to the 15-man game after two years with rugby league.

Williams loves to spend time with his many niece and nephews, with the hands-on uncle often opening up about his love and bond with the smallest members of his family

The dual international concluded his second stint in rugby league in late September, when the Sydney Roosters bowed out of the semi-finals and quickly returned to the All Black's set-up. 

Williams and wife are yet to officially confirm both their marriage and the pregnancy, and it's expected they will continue to 'keep mum' about their private life.

Williams grew up in New Zealand but moved to Sydney 12 years ago when he was offered a contract to play with the Bulldogs in the NRL's junior grades

'To be honest when it comes to my private life with my family, I always try to keep it private because every other aspect of my life is so out there in the media,' Williams told The Daily Telegraph earlier in the year.

'That's all I'll say. In regards to being married, that's something I'll keep to myself.'

Rumours were rife in May that his 21-year-old wife Alana was expecting their first child, sparked by photographs of Ms Raffie with a suspicious bump while shopping in Sydney.

It appears they may be practicing for parenthood, with Williams often referring to his wife as 'mumsy' on Instagram.

In December last year, Williams announced his return to rugby union with the Chiefs on a two year deal, starting in 2015

The 29-year-old rugby star is very family-oriented, proudly posting photographs of himself playing with his nieces and nephews on Social Media – and even boasting that he is 'the baby whisperer'.

He secretly married Ms Raffie after a whirlwind romance in August 2013.

His wife, an aspiring model, has converted to Islam, as her husband has been a devout Muslim since his 2008 conversion.

After a string of off-field indiscretions Williams turned his life around when he found his faith, during his stint playing rugby in France for Toulon.

He is the first Muslim to play for the All Blacks.

The couple is expected to welcome their first child in New Zealand, after moving from their home in Sydney's south at the conclusion of the NRL season.
