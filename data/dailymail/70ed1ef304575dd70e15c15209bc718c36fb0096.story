Simon Cowell might not be terribly flattered, but voters say that when they think of Ukip, they also think of him.

A focus group said the party reminded them of the X Factor boss because it was so dependent on Nigel Farage’s celebrity.

The research, which took place in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and Thurrock in Essex, was commissioned by Tory grandee Lord Ashcroft.

The research, which took place in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and Thurrock in Essex, found that voters think of X Factor boss Simon Cowell (above) when they think of Ukip because of Nigel Farage's celebrity

When asked to come up with an image associated with Labour, the panel chose one of a man slouched on a sofa with a beer.

One panel member said they chose the slob to represent Mr Miliband’s party because: ‘Labour encourage that kind of behaviour. They make it too easy for people not to work and earn their money.’

In a further headache for the Labour leader, when the focus groups were asked to choose words to describe the party, the top choices were ‘weak’, ‘confused’ and ‘dull’.

Some chose a photo of a miner to represent the party, which Lord Ashcroft said could indicate they are seen as old-fashioned and in hock to the unions.

The most popular photo to represent the Conservatives was a well-heeled family outside a country house, while one of the words chosen to describe them was ‘out-of-touch’.

The Tories are also seen as ‘sensible’ and ‘aggressive’, while many panel members chose a photo of Big Ben to show they were too focused on London.

As well as choosing a picture of Mr Cowell, the focus group chose a photo of a Union Jack to represent UKIP. The words chosen were ‘dangerous’ and ‘hope’.

Lord Ashcroft said: ‘If a picture of a flag was a predictable choice to represent UKIP, a picture of Simon Cowell was surely not.

‘This symbolised the view that the party depended on the personality of its leader, who had become something of a celebrity – a status which he seemed rather to be enjoying.

‘Many gave Nigel Farage credit for having a refreshingly unstuffy approach and answering interviewers’ questions rather than avoiding them.’
