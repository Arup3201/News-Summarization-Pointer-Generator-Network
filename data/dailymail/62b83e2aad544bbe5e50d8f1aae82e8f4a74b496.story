Five months is a long time in football and an eternity in the struggle for supremacy between Real Madrid and Barcelona.

When Gareth Bale made his Clasico debut in October Barcelona won 2-1 with a goal from Neymar who had supposedly cost just £48.6m.

Bale was hauled off after hour – having cost twice as much as his opposing number and yet looking like half the player.

On the up: After a stuttered start, Bale has started to prove his worth with 14 goals and 17 assists this season

Boy from Brazil: By contrast, Neymar scored on his first taste of La Liga's biggest game

When he makes his Santiago Bernabeu 
clasico debut on Sunday Real Madrid will be four points ahead of their 
rivals instead of six points behind and his world has been turned upside
 down.

Gone are the concerns about his injury problems and with them the doubts over his price tag.

Neymar’s
 real value, in contrast, has everyone obsessed. An investigation into 
how much he really cost is now up around the £80m mark and as the 
price has risen, his worth to the team has declined. The more expensive 
he becomes the worse he looks; and the more Bale looks like a bargain in
 comparison.

Bale has found
 a home out on the right of Real Madrid’s now famed BBC front three 
alongside [Karim] Benzema and  Cristiano [Ronaldo] and the combination 
has scored 52 goals between them with Bale getting on the scoresheet 14 
times and providing 17 assists – more than any other La Liga based 
player.

The injuries have 
cleared up too. After a two-month period around the mid-winter break 
when his minutes-played ratio dropped below 50 per cent and it seemed he
 was being held together by blue Kinesiology tape, he now looks far less
 worthy of the ‘Glassman’ nickname he had been given by some, and has 
played all but 17 minutes of the last nine games

There
 was a cruel irony that his room in the players’ private hotel at 
Madrid’s Valdebebas training complex where the team often stay overnight
 before or after big games was opposite the physio’s room, but he is now
 taking big matches in his stride, even coming off the bench in midweek 
to replace Jese whose cruciate ligament had been torn ruling him out for
 the rest of the season.

Tale of the tape: How Bale and Neymar's first seasons in la Liga have compared

The
 21-year-old Jese had come on in that first Clasico scoring Real 
Madrid’s consolation goal and begging the question why spend 100m euros 
when you have such a home-grown talent coming through for free.

Shedding
 light on Bale’s physical fragility his former Wales boss John Toshack 
told Marca this week: 'He had several serious injuries when he was a 
very young player. The first one ruled him out for 10 months and the 
second for nine. That is a long time to be out between the age of 18 and
 20. The treatment he had was not always the best and that is why he 
needs to be 100 per cent and can’t be one of these players who can play 
through injury.'

Money matters: Neymar signed for Barcelona for a supposed £48.6m, although that price is being questioned

Paying the price: The more Neymar is reported to be worth, the worse his performances on the pitch have been

Brothers in arms: Meanwhile, Bale has struck up a blossoming relationship with the world's best, Ronaldo

The stress 
of not being physically right accompanied the doubts over that world 
record price-tag. He said on the day of his presentation that he would 
have signed for a penny. That certainly would have lowered expectations.
 He had not come cheaply and no-one has let him forget that during a 
first season in which during several games he has even been whistled by 
impatient supporters.

Olympiacos
 coach Michel is a former Real Madrid player who knows all about the 
demands of the Bernabeu. He was jeered too despite being a home-grown 
talent and Spain international.

'It’s
 impossible for that price tag not to weigh heavy,' he says. 'The first 
person who will think ‘I’m probably not worth 100m’ is the player 
himself.

Fighting fit: Bale has recovered from the injury problems that plagued the start of his career at the Bernabeu

Weighing heavy: Olympiacos coach Michel (C) has warned of the pressure on Bale from his enormous price tag

'It’s not the 
player’s fault, it’s the market’s fault. And the fact that he doesn’t 
understand the Spanish media will not save him because you can smell the
 doubts. I’m certain that he will be aware of people questioning the 
price. The spotlight is on him and it is not just an external spotlight.
 At a big club like Madrid the spotlight is also internal.'

But
 the escalation of the Neymar fee with the uncovering of more and more 
contracts that if interpreted to have been simulated wages will send the
 price rising further because of tax evasion penalties has changed 
Bale’s status as La Liga’s most expensive player.

And
 the idea that the Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has to pick Bale 
because he cost so much has been replaced by the notion that Gerardo 
Martino at Barcelona is under boardroom pressure to select Neymar.

Stick or twist? Criticism of Carlo Ancelotti (L) and Gerardo Martinez's selection policies have changed

'No-one
 can say that Bale doesn’t deserve to be in the team on his own merit 
because his numbers speak for themselves,' says Michel.

Ancelotti
 has admitted his team for Sunday’s game now picks itself with Bale very
 much in it. Barcelona coach Martino, meanwhile, knows supporters want 
him  to leave Neymar where he was last weekend when Barça won 7-0 – on 
the bench.

The forward line 
of Alexis Sanchez, Pedro and Leo Messi has actually only scored one goal
 fewer than Real Madrid’s famed BBC and Barça followers want those three
 to start this weekend.

Whoever
 accompanies Messi, Sunday will still be about him and Ronaldo first and
 foremost. The idea that Ronaldo is now ‘streets ahead of any other 
player in the world’ as heard by some commentators in midweek forgets 
that Messi has scored 17 goals in his last 17 games.

The weekend’s duel will throw up the usual race to break more and more ridiculous records.

Lionel Flair: Messi is getting back to his best after a season disrupted by injury

Ronaldo
 needs another goal to beat Ferenc Puskas’ 240 goals scored for Madrid 
and Messi is one goal short of Alfredo Di Stefano’s 18 goals scored in 
the Clasico fixture record. The Argentine is also one goal from Hugo 
Sanchez in the all-time league scorers list – passing him would leave 
only Telmo Zarra to aim for.

The two of them will fight it out for top of the bill but there is a fascinating undercard.  

Bale
 lost out to Neymar last October but now he has his rematch and after an
 incredible turn around in their first seasons in Spain he is favourite 
to come out on top on Sunday and to win his first Spanish League title 
at the end of the season.
