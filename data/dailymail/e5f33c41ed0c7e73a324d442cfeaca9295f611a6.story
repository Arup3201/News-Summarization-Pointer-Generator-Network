Voters in Maine, Maryland and Washington state legalized gay marriage last night in historic shift on the controversial issue.

The three referendums, combined with Minnesota voting down a constitutional amendment banning same-sex matrimony, mark the first time supporters of 'traditional marriage' have ever lost at the polls.

All 32 previous times the issue has come before the people - weather banning it or legalizing it - voters have chosen to define marriage as between one man and one woman.

Six states allow gay couples to wed, but each of those measures were been enacted either by a court decision or a vote of the state legislature.

The federal government does not 
recognize same-sex marriages, but the Obama administration announced 
early in his first term that the Justice Department would not enforce 
the federal Defense of Marriage Act.

In
the weeks leading up to the vote, Minnesota for Marriage ran a Facebook
photo campaign of Northwestern College students, who were photographed 
with signs that read: 'I'm voting yes because...' with their own 
personal message.

Similar measures were approved in 30 other states, most recently in North Carolina in May by a wide 61-to-39-percent margin.

'The tide has turned - when voters have the opportunity to really hear directly from loving, committed same-sex couples and their families, they voted for fairness,' said Rick Jacobs of the Courage Campaign, a California-based gay rights group. 'Those who oppose the freedom to marry for committed couples are clearly on the wrong side of history.'

The outcomes of the marriage votes 
could influence the U.S. Supreme Court, which will soon consider whether
to take up cases challenging the law that denies federal recognition to
same-sex marriages.

The gay-rights victories come on the 
heels of numerous national polls that, for the first time, show a 
majority of Americans supporting same-sex marriage.

Maine's referendum marked the first time that gay-rights supporters put same-sex marriage legalization to a popular vote.

They collected enough signatures to 
schedule the vote, hoping to reverse a 2009 referendum that quashed a 
gay-marriage law enacted by the Legislature.

It passed 53 percent to 47 percent, with 272,000 Mainers voting against it.

In Maryland and Washington, 
gay-marriage laws were approved by lawmakers and signed by the governors
this year, but opponents gathered enough signatures to challenge the 
laws.

Celebration: Gay marriage supporters in Washington State turned out to cheer as a referendum legalizing the practice passed

Maryland Gov Martin O'Malley, who campaigned vigorously for the marriage measure, spoke to a jubilant crowd in Baltimore.

Those ballot proposals each passed by a 52-to-48-percent margin.

Christopher Wold, 31, danced with his
partner of four years after the result in Maryland became clear. He said they would
like to marry now that it's legal in Maryland.

'It feels so good to be accepted by so many people of all different backgrounds,' he said. 'It just feels wonderful.'

In Minnesota, gay marriage remains illegal, but an act of the state legislature could overturn the law. Had it become a constitutional amendment, it would have been more difficult for gay rights advocates to undo the measure.

The vote was 51 percent against the ban and 48 for it.

The president of the most active 
advocacy group opposing same-sex marriage, Brian Brown of the National 
Organization for Marriage, insisted Tuesday's results did not mark a 
watershed moment.

'At the end of the day, we're still 
at 32 victories,' he said. 'Just because two extreme blue states vote 
for gay marriage doesn't mean the Supreme Court will create a 
constitutional right for it out of thin air.'

He made his remarks before the outcome of Washington's referendum became clear.
