Accused: Stuart Hinton could be imprisoned by MPs until 2015

A policeman accused of lying in the ‘Plebgate’ row involving former Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell faces the extraordinary prospect of being forced to make a humiliating apology to the Commons.

A powerful Commons committee is considering putting Detective Sergeant Stuart  Hinton ‘on trial’ after he was accused of falsely denying having called Home Secretary Theresa May ‘that woman’.

MPs are deciding whether to summon Det Sgt Hinton to ‘the  bar of the Commons’ – a  punishment not used for more than half a century.

If he refuses to apologise for allegedly misleading them,  MPs – in theory – have the power to jail him for the rest of this Parliament, not due to end until May 2015. However that is unlikely to happen.

The row follows Det Sgt Hinton’s appearance with two fellow Police Federation officials at the Commons Home Affairs Committee last week to answer claims they gave a false account of a meeting with Mr Mitchell in October last year.

The officers said Mr Mitchell  refused to give a full account of what he had said in Downing Street, when he was accused of calling police ‘f****** plebs’ after they stopped him cycling through the gates. He was forced to resign a week later.

But a recording of the meeting made by Mr Mitchell, and published recently, revealed they had misrepresented him.

According to the transcript, Det Sgt Hinton said the men had problems with ‘that woman the Conservative Party have’ – Mrs May. The alleged remark was made at a time when the Home Secretary was imposing budget cuts on forces.

Conservative MP Michael Ellis, a member of the Home Affairs Committee, told Det Sgt Hinton the remark was ‘disgraceful’. The officer denied saying it and told MPs there must have been a ‘typing error’, adding: ‘I don’t recall using the term “this woman”.’

When the meeting finished, chairman Keith
 Vaz told the officers: ‘We have found your evidence most 
unsatisfactory.’

He reminded them that to give false witness to a 
parliamentary committee is ‘a prima facie contempt of Parliament’.

It is believed the committee has 
written to Det Sgt Hinton to inform him the transcript indicates he 
called Mrs May ‘that woman’ – and inviting him to admit he lied and to 
apologise.

If he refuses, the MPs may use their historic sanction  to 
‘admonish’ offenders for misleading Parliament by summoning them to the
 ‘bar’ – directly facing the Speaker.

He would then be invited to say 
sorry. If he refuses, MPs can vote to reprimand him, or, in theory, 
imprison him.

The last 
member of the public to be summoned to the bar was former Sunday Express
 editor Sir John Junor in January 1957, after he published an article 
criticising politicians’ petrol allowances.

He
 was rebuked by MPs for failing to ‘establish the truth of the article’ 
and not being willing to ‘admit its obvious implications’. He apologised
 and no further action was taken.

Pressure
 on Det Sgt Hinton also mounted last night after he received a public 
rebuke from his boss, Warwickshire Chief Constable Andy Parker.

In a letter to Mr Mitchell, Mr Parker lambasted Det Sgt Hinton for using the incident to ‘campaign against police cuts’.

Det Sgt Hinton was unavailable for comment last night.
