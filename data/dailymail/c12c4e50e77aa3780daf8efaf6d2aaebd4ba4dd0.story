Off the coast of Isla de Mujeres near the Mexican city of Cancun a hidden world lies buried 28ft beneath the ocean waves.

The Cancun Underwater Museum, also known as MUSA, is a collection of sculptures deliberately placed on the ocean floor by English artist Jason deCaires Taylor.

Each of the 460 statues in the underwater exhibition are made from PH-neutral marine concrete designed to encourage marine plants to grow and attract fish to the region, and the museum was set up to draw tourists away from nearby coral reefs.

The Cancun Underwater Museum, also known as MUSA, is a collection of sculptures created by English artist Jason deCaires Taylor. The exhibition is placed underwater off the coast of Isla de Mujeres and Cancun, Mexico. Each of the statues and items on display are made from PH-neutral marine concrete

According to the tourist board, around 300,000 people visit the 
area each year, 
but snorkeling groups have been known to cause damage to marine life, for example, by kicking them as they swim past. 

Jaime Gonzalez, director of the West 
Coast National Park, said: 'If they swim near the corals, the divers 
with little experience might kick them with a fin or hit them with the 
oxygen tank. Before it was
 declared a park, the tourists even climbed up the corals and walked on 
top of them, breaking and shattering them.'

DeCaires-Taylor added: 'Something had to be done about the 
damage to the local reef areas. Hurricanes, tropical storms and mankind 
were taking their toll on these natural gardens.'

He came up with the idea of submerging life-sized statues in
 order to create an artificial reef area where coral could 
grow, and in which marine life and fish could live and breed.

The MUSA collection is made up of 450 life-sized sculptures, like the one pictured. Some 400 sculptures were submerged in 2010 and 50 new ones were added in August 2012. The whole display is known as Silent Evolution

DeCaires Taylor designed the sculptures to become artificial reefs in a bid to draw tourists away from the coral reefs off the coast of Cancun. The natural reefs were becoming damaged because snorkelers would accidentally kick them as they swam through. The project began in 2009 and many of the displays, pictured left and right, have already started growing plants and attracting marine life although this gives the statues an eerie appearance

Many of the statues were made to resemble members from the local community in Isla Mujeres. This image shows one of the models, far left, and the various stages of marine life growth on his neutral concrete statue since 2009, from left to right. As well as encouraging growth, the artificial reef will change over time giving tourists a different look each time

DeCaires Taylor then teamed up 
with Gonzalez as well as Roberto Diaz,
the President of the Nautical Association for Cancun and Isla Mujeres, to create the attraction. 

Around
 400 of the sculptures were submerged in 2010 and 50 new statues were added
 in August 2012. The whole display is known as Silent Evolution.

Some corals, including fire coral, have been planted on and near the 
initial sculptures to encourage more coral to grow. The statues themselves have also naturally become 
covered with coral over time. 

The designers collected the coral from damaged fragments washed up following tropical storms. 
They also grew a small portion artificially. As well as encouraging 
growth, the artificial reef will change over time giving tourists a 
different look each time they visit.

The statues in the display form the shape of an eye which helps disperse currents and tropical storms. A number of fish species have returned to the area after not being seen for years. Over 100 angelfish, pictured, were recently spotted surrounding the statues

Fire coral was planted on a number of the statues, left and right, to encourage other marine life to grow. Fire coral is a fast growing coral that was placed in the holes of each of these statues. The designers collected the coral from damaged fragments washed up following tropical storms. They also grew a small portion artificially

The majority of statues in the display form the 
shape of an eye, designed in such a way to control and disperse currents
 in the area, and reduce the risk of tropical storms caused by these currents.

A
 number of fish species, including angelfish, have also returned to the area 
after not being seen for years as a result of the sculptures, according to the museum, and more 
than 100 were recently spotted surrounding the statues.

Many of the statues were made to 
resemble members from the local community in Isla Mujeres, while others 
were designed especially for the display.

These include a sculpture of a suited man with his head buried in the sand, called The Banker.

The
 sculpture is said to 'depict the recent denial and lack of transparency
 defined by the current economical crisis.' Its design 'supports an 
internal living space for crustaceans and juvenile fish to breed.'

This sculpture is of a suited man with his head buried in the sand called The Banker. The sculpture is said to 'depict the recent denial and lack of transparency defined by the current economical crisis.' The design supports an internal living space for crustaceans and juvenile fish to breed.  In August 2012 Jason submerged five new pieces to accompany The Banker

This sculpture is cast from a Volkswagen, the design of which was used to let fish and marine life swim through and live in. The rounded shape of the beetle means it can 'sustain strong currents or tropical storms'. The sculpture weighs eight tonnes and specifically contains internal spaces for lobsters and crustaceans

In 
August 2012 DeCaires Taylor submerged five new pieces to accompany The Banker. This
 included a sculpture of a Volkswagen, the design of which was used to let fish and 
marine life swim through and live in the crevices of the car and its tyres.

The rounded shape of the 
beetle means it can 'sustain strong currents or tropical storms' as 
well, creating a safe place for creatures to live. The sculpture weighs 
eight tonnes and specifically contains internal spaces for lobsters and crustaceans.

Another is called The Dream 
Collector. According to DeCaires Taylor: 'the archive of lost dreams 
depicts an underwater archive guarded and protected by a registrar.'

The registrar is said to have categorised the 
bottles shown in the sculpture and each bottle contains its own message
 of 'fear, hope, loss or belonging.'

The team are planning to submerge more sculptures in this year.

The bottles shown on the shelves each contain their own message of 'fear, hope, loss or belonging' written by the sleeping sculpture, right

Excursions to the underwater museum cost between $69 (£39) and $71 (£43) depending on the diver's experience and equipment
