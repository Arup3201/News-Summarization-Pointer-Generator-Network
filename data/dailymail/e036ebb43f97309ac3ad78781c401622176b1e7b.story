Anything Sarah Lund can do, British celebrities will have a jolly good bash at doing better.

The Danish star of The Killing is famed for her character's predilection for wooly Faroese jumpers, whatever the season.

And now a gaggle of charitable ladies and gents from our very own isle have donned a selection of merry Christmas sweaters to raise money for Save The Children - and famous faces involved include Laurene Laverne, Erin O'Connor, Alison Steadman and Jon Snow.

The celebrities - who also include TOWIE's Mark Wright, singer Myleene Klass and Superstar winner Ben Forster - are backing a campaign to 'make the world better with a sweater'.

And now people across the UK are being invited to take part in Christmas Jumper Day on Friday 14 December, wearing a kitsch festive pullover in 
exchange for a £1 donation.

A charity spokesman said: 'All money raised will help save the lives of the world's most vulnerable children.

'In the world's poorest countries, more than 7 million children die every year from easily preventable causes like diarrhoea and malnutrition.

'Simple solutions, like vaccines and mosquito nets save lives - so by getting friends and colleagues to take part in Save the Children's Christmas Jumper day on 14 December, you can help make a real difference.'

To take part in Christmas Jumper Day visit the Save The Children website, on which you will find information about signing up.

Those who sign up - either individually or as part of a school group - will receive information packs and online access to knitting patterns for making your own merry sweater.

Have a thrifty, charitable Christmas!

If you have a juicy Christmas bonus to spend and fancy getting your kicks with a fashion fabulous Christmas jumper, head for online designer fashion emporium Net-a-Porter.

The website has opened its festive knitwear department, offering exclusive jumpers including the £945 bauble-covered design from Meadham Kirchhoff, right.

The elaborate red knitted sweater was inspired by the 1960s gift paper that Benjamin Kirchhoff wrapped Edward Meadham's presents in.

The piece features beaded intricate Zardozi metallic embroidery.

But if that's a little out of your price range, the luxury site has other offerings, including a £396 white Moschino jumper decorated with a reindeer, and a grey £355 Tibi sweater featuring a giant penguin.
