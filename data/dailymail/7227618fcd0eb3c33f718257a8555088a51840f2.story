Juventus and Inter Milan will go head-to-head in January as they both try to sign Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski.

Podolski has found himself out of favour at the Emirates and is open to a mid-season move away.

Juventus have confirmed their interest with CEO Giuseppe Marotta admitting: ‘If there is a possibility in January to move on the transfer market [for Podolski] we will do that.’

Inter Milan are also interested in the German international who is finding  opportunities difficult to come by under Arsene Wenger this season following the summer additions of Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck at Arsenal.

Podolski, who has scored 47 goals for Germany in 118 internationals, joined the London club in 2012.

He was not involved in the opening four matches of the season following Germany's successful World Cup in Brazil, and has been an unused substitute four times in Arsenal's last eight matches.

He has come on for the last few minutes of the Premier League games against Leicester City and Aston Villa and the Champions League defeat at Borussia Dortmund and has only played an entire match once - Arsenal's 2-1 home defeat against Southampton in the Capital One Cup last week when he looked a peripheral figure.

He did not feature in Arsenal's 4-1 win over Galatasaray in the Champions League on Wednesday where again he was an unused substitute and has yet to find the net this season.
