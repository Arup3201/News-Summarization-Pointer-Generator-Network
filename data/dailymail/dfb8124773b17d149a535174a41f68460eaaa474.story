An awe-inspiring exhibition that captures the unintentional beauty of some of the world's foremost scientific research facilities has launched.

It features the anechoic chambers at the Technical University of Denmark and the Four Solaire in the French PyreneesÂ  - two of the most advanced engineering feats of modern history.

The chambers - which are designed to completely absorb sound waves - have rarely been seen as space scientists have tested state-of-the-art satellite equipment in them since first opening in 1967.

The inside of the chambers have rarely been seen as space scientists have tested state-of-the-art satellite equipment in them since first opening in 1967

Pictured is the door to the chamber. The images are part of an exhibition being held at Copenhagen's Gallery Etage Project

The room prevents sound waves from bouncing around thanks to the unique shape of the walls

The Four Solaire, the world's largest solar furnace, delivers the world's purest power by harnessing the sun's energy and concentrating it on a single point.

The design, first built by Dr Felix Trombe, is made up of 10,000 mirrors that can bounce sun rays at a pinpoint - sending temperatures soaring to an almighty 3,500 0C.

British photographer Alastair Philip Wiper is now showcasing his Solar/Anechoic collection at Copenhagen's Gallery Etage Project.

An awe-inspiring exhibition that captures the unintentional beauty of some of the world's foremost scientific research facilities is attracting global interest. Four Solaire in the French Pyrenees is the world's largest sun furnace

The show 'solar/anechoic' features a stunning series of images of the worlds largest sun furnace (pictured) and echo-free room

The exhibition shows that science can beautiful, even when it is not intending to be

Alastair said: 'These facilities are designed to be purely functional, to push the limits of heat, radio and sound waves, and they are awe inspiring in their contribution to the advancement of mankind both on our planet and in space.

'They are also remarkable for their visual impact.

'Without understanding the complexities of the functions of the facilities it is possible to marvel at the ingenuity of human beings and their ability to create such inadvertent masterpieces.'

On his website he writes: 'The things that human beings create and build amaze me, and I take an anthropological approach to the subjects of my photography.

'We rarely consider the infrastructure, the strange technology inside industrial estates, or those gargantuan buildings by the side of the motorway. But we should, because it is incredible.'
