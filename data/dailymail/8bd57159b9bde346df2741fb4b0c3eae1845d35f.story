The two artists who collaborated with Shia LaBeouf on an art project called #IAMSORRY have backed up the actor’s allegation that he was raped during the performance earlier this year.

For five days in February, the 28-year-old invited the public to visit him one-on-one in a small room in a Los Angeles gallery where he sat wearing a paper bag over his face that read: 'I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE'.

'One woman came with her boyfriend, who was outside the door when this happened,' the actor wrote during a bizarre interview with Dazed Digital that was conducted over email last Thursday.

Shia LaBeouf's collaborators on the #IAMSORRY art project have backed up the his allegation that he was raped during a performance on Valentine's Day.The 28-year-old actor recalled: '[She] whipped my legs for 10 minutes and then stripped my clothing and proceeded to rape me'

LaBeouf's collaborators on the #IAMSORRY art project took to Twitter on Sunday and clarified that they had never said that people could do what they liked with the Hollywood actor during the performance

'[She] whipped my legs for 10 minutes and then stripped my clothing and proceeded to rape me.’

LaBeouf’s collaborators, British artist Luke Turner and Finnish artist Nastja Säde Rönkkö, have said they intervened as soon as they became aware of the incident and ‘put a stop to it’.

Both artists posted the same statements on Twitter on Sunday, which they described as ‘important clarifications’ about the project.

‘Nowhere did we state that people could do whatever they wanted to Shia during #IAMSORRY.

‘As soon as we were aware of the incident starting to occur, we put a stop to it and ensured that the woman left.’

When asked if the incident was reported to the police, Turner did not respond but said that their collaboration with the actor continued.

'It was painful': Shia LaBeouf claimed on Thursday that a woman raped him during his #IAMSORRY performance art installation at the Stephen Cohen Gallery in Los Angeles, California, on Valentine's Day

LaBeouf told Dazed that the woman ‘walked out with disheveled hair and smudged lipstick’ past ‘hundreds of people in line’ including Mia Goth, his girlfriend of two years.

'It was no good, not just for me but her man as well,' LaBeouf wrote. 

'It was Valentine’s Day and I was living in the gallery for the duration [February 11-16] of the event.

'We (Mia and I) were separated for five days, no communication.

'So it really hurt her as well, as I guess the news of it traveled through the line.

'When she came in she asked for an explanation, and I couldn't speak, so we both sat with this unexplained trauma silently. It was painful.'

LaBeouf also vented his frustration at gallery patrons who would 'come in, take my [paper] bag off, pop off a selfie, and bounce.'

'We both sat with this unexplained trauma silently': Even more unsettling was that Shia's girlfriend of two years, Mia Goth, was among the 'hundreds' waiting for a one-on-one with him (pictured on Tuesday)

'Some would hold my hand and cry with me, some would tell me to "figure it out" or to "be a man." I’ve never experienced love like that; empathy, humanity.'

In the wide-reaching interview, LaBeouf confessed that he longed for the kind of family he saw in the 1990 flick Home Alone.

'I always had a f****d up view on masculinity,' he admitted. 

'My father [Jeffrey] was a gun nut like Hemingway. He was also a junkie and a bully, mainly to prove he wasn’t effeminate, even though he was a painter and a poet, a mime, and a storyteller.' 

After corresponding with British reporter Aimee Cliff for two weeks online, the pair donned GoPros and sat together silently in LaBeouf's London hotel room last month. 

The hour-long 'metamodernist encounter' was mostly a chance for the two to stare awkwardly with intermittent giggles.

#IAMSORRY was the culmination of several bizarre incidents - belligerent outbursts, plagiarism, and public martyrdom involving paper-bag masks marked: 'I am not famous anymore' (pictured February 9)

In June, the Transformers star was arrested for criminal trespass, disorderly conduct, and harassment at a Broadway production of Cabaret.

In an interview with Jimmy Kimmel he explained that his arrest came after he'd been drinking whiskey for several hours following a trip to Ireland and that he was merely trying to calm the homeless man he was photographed with in Times Square. 

According to TMZ, the judge gave Shia a 'thumbs-up' after he brought a progress report detailing his outpatient alcohol rehab to Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday. 

He's due in court again March when he completes his treatment.

LaBeouf just ranked #21 on GQ's list of the 30 least influential people of 2014 alongside Woody Allen, Robin Thicke, and Zach Braff.

The Charlie Countryman actor shaved his head for his role as former U.S. Marine Gabriel Drummer in the post-apocalyptic thriller Man Down.

In it, Shia - who joined the National Guard this year - reunited with his Guide to Recognizing Your Saints director Dito Montiel.

Gary Oldman, Kate Mara, and Jai Courtney also appear in Man Down - due out October 30.

LaBeouf can currently be seen as tank soldier Boyd Swan in the WWII flick Fury with Brad Pitt, Scott Eastwood, and Michael Peña.
