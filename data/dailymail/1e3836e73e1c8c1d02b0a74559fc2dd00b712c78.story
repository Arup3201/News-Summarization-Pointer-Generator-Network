Praising George McGovern as a man who's 1972 presidential campaign inspired a new wave of political activism who's ramifications can still be seen today, hundreds turned out to pay respects Friday to the former senator they called the 'conscience for our nation.'

Among the mourners attending Mcgovern's funeral in Sioux Falls, S.D.,  were three former Democratic presidential candidates: Walter Mondale, Gary Hart, and John Kerry. 

Like Mondale, each man spent time in the Senate before an unsuccessful run at the Oval Office.

Legacy: Vice President Joe Biden eulogized McGovern as a man who helped giver women, minorities, and young people a greater voice in the Democratic Party

Hart was the only one of them to speak at the funeral.

'George McGovern's voice is not gone. It is 
simply waiting new voices, new consciences that have the courage of 
their conviction,' said Hart, a former Colorado Senator served as 
McGovern's campaign manager in 1972. 'George McGovern was a voice of conscience 
for our nation in our time.'

U.S. Senator George McGovern, 90, is 'coming to the end of his life'

McGovern died Sunday at the age of 90 after a brief stay in hospice care.

Friends and colleagues remembered McGovern as an early critic of the Vietnam War, a 
tireless advocate to combat poverty, and a 
man who's legacy will continue to inspire young people into a life of public service.

Hart called McGovern a man who could rise 
above the rhetoric of politics, particularly when his opponents tried to
use the term 'liberal' as an insult to malign him as a supposedly 
weak-willed candidate.

'He was larger than any political label, 
particularly a demonized one,' Hart said.

McGovern famously lost to Richard Nixon in a landslide only two years before the Republican president would resign in the wake of the Watergate scandal.

Admirer: Speaking at a memorial service for McGovern Thursday, Vice President Joe Biden praised as the 'father of the modern Democrat Party'

Nixon's victory was among the most decisive in the history of U.S. elections as he took every state, even McGovern's South Dakota home, with the exception of Massachusetts.

However McGovern's campaign is credited as the spark that ignited the stars of today's Democratic Party, especially two of his former campaign workers: now secretary-of-state Hillary Clinton and former president Bill Clinton.

The night before his funeral, Vice President Joe Biden spoke at a memorial service for McGovern calling him the 'father of the modern Democratic Party' for his ferocious opposition to the Vietnam War as well as helping to open the party to women, young people, and minorities.

In 2008, he was 
awarded the World Food Prize along with former Republican Sen. Bob Dole, another defeated presidential candidate.

A basket brimming with dried food goods that will go to a needy
family was on display in the lobby as a tribute to McGovern's fight against hunger.

The service's program quoted a comment Pope John XXII made to McGovern when he was an emissary to Rome 
for John F. Kennedy's administration: 'When you meet your Maker
and he asks, `Have you fed the hungry, given drink to the thirsty, and 
cared for the lonely?' you can answer, `Yes.''

Several Republicans also attended as a show of bipartisan support, including South Dakota's Gov. Dennis Daugaard, Sen. John Thune and Rep. Kristi Noem.

Former
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, a fellow South Dakota Democrat, 
held McGovern up as a model citizen who overcame hardship to lead a life
of public service.

"I've never known anybody 
who preached the gospel more effectively in so many ways than George: a 
peacemaker, a humanitarian, a teacher, a minister, a congressman, a 
senator, a voice for the voiceless and a champion for hungry children," 
Daschle said.

Elder Statesman: Former U.S. Senator Gary Hart praised McGovern during the service

As a respect for McGovern's stature in South Dakota, the service aired live on television in the 
state's largest city.

After McGovern lost his campaign for a fourth Senate term he left office in 1981.

The funeral was filled with tender reflections and humorous tales 
from McGovern's past. A bagpipe processional closed the service.

McGovern will be interred at a private burial in Washington scheduled for a later.

Generations: One of former U.S. Senator George McGovern's eight great-grandchildren held a folded flag as his casket arrived at the funeral service

Larry Fuller, a 
retired newspaper publisher from Sioux Falls who became friends with 
McGovern, called it was a fitting tribute for the man who served the state for two decades.

'I
think it's a wonderful opportunity for this state to recognize 
everything he did for South Dakota, something that didn't happen after 
his last election,' Fuller said. 'I can't think of any South Dakotans 
who had as positive and impact on history as George McGovern.'

McGovern's funeral and memorial services have been a reunion for his supporters. People who backed him for president came wearing 'McGovern' campaign buttons and took group photos while another man wore a button demanding: 'I Want McGovernment.'

Shortly before the
funeral, McGovern's family gathered to walk behind a hearse bringing 
the senator's flag-draped coffin the few blocks from a funeral home to 
the arts center for the service.

One of McGovern's eight 
great-grandchildren held a crisply folded flag at the front of the 
processional.

Bill Walsh, of Deadwood, S.D., 
drove 400 miles to attend the funeral of a man he has known since 
growing up two blocks away from McGovern's home in Mitchell 60 years 
ago

Reflecting on the 1972 campaign, Walsh said his friend could have 
won the presidency if he had emphasized his record as a war hero.

McGovern's role as a military pilot who did bombing runs over Europe during World 
War II earned him medals
for valor, but was reluctant to mention that in a campaign, 
especially in the presidential race where he urged an immediate end to 
U.S. involvement in Vietnam.

Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern, who is not related to George McGovern, also spoke about love McGovern had for his country.
