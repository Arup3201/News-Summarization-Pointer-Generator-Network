Manchester
 United are reported to have made an offer for Wolfsburg left-back 
Ricardo Rodriguez but the club has yet to confirm the interest.

With Juventus keen on Patrice Evra, United will need another option as competition for Luke Shaw but Wolfsburg want more than £15million for Rodriguez who has also been watched by Liverpool and Tottenham.

He impressed for Switzerland at the World Cup on the back of a decent Bundesliga season.

United are interested in several players but are wary of being used to hike up prices. They have yet to make an offer for Arturo Vidal at Juventus, although he has been on their list for some time and that applies for Angel di Maria, too, with Real Madrid keen to sell for inflated prices to help fund deals for Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez.

Fiorentina have an interest in Marouane Fellaini but the Italians will struggle to match United's valuation.

They are waiting on bids for Juan Cuadrado, who United have also watched, but Barcelona are considered favourites for him.

Arsenal may be poised to sell another right-back as clubs show interest in Carl Jenkinson.

Manager Arsene Wenger has lost Bacary Sagna to Manchester City but quickly identified Mathieu Debuchy as his replacement.

However, now England U21 international Jenkinson is attracting enquiries and Arsenal may contemplate a sale.

Wenger had originally considered loaning out 22-year-old Jenkinson with Newcastle and West Ham among those to have shown an interest. Sunderland were another but they have since recruited Billy Jones from West Bromwich Albion.

Arsenal have compiled a list of right-backs after targeting Sagna's replacement so have others on their list they could turn to if a decent bid for Jenkinson arrives.

They have been asked to give a trial to Al Ahly right-back Ahmed Fathy. The Egyptian, who had a short spell at Hull City and had trias at Arsenal at 20, is quick and versatile but now 29. He is ready to travel to London after Monday's Egyptian Premier League title decider with Smouha if Arsenal give him the go-ahead.

It is not unfeasible that Jenkinson's name will be thrown into discussions over Debuchy's transfer fee but Newcastle would like the cash and have made enquiries for Feyenoord's Daryl Janmaat, City's Micah Richards and Ajax defender Ricardo van Rhijn.

Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko is due to hold talks with manager Alan Pardew over his future.

Sissoko was linked with Monaco and Liverpool over the weekend although Liverpool say he is not a player who has cropped up in recent conversations.

Napoli have also been linked but again have other priorities. The 24-year-old is scheduled to fly out with Newcastle to New Zealand for games with Sydney FC and Wellington Phoenix on July 22 and July 26, but those talks with Pardew may see him stay behind to resolve his future with other clubs.

Newcastle continue to work on a number of transfer targets with Monaco striker Emmanuel Riviere, an option for West Brom and Stoke, also on their list.

Sunderland have a definite interest in signing Jack Rodwell from Manchester City.

Manager Gus Poyet is determined to add more quality to his early summer bargains of Costel Pantilimon, Jordi Gomez and Billy Jones and has enquired about the figures for 23-year-old Rodwell.

He is not alone of course with Everton, West Bromwich Albion and Newcastle among others to have asked, while Arsenal also have a tentative interest.

Rodwell is desperate to get his career back on track and play more games. City are also still fielding enquiries for Javi Garcia but much may depend on the unsettled Yaya Toure. Should he push for a move it may have a bearing on what City do with Rodwell and Garcia.

Sunderland remain keen on Cardiff City's £3m-rated Jordon Mutch while Brighton striker Craig Mackail-Smith has also been discussed as a surprise option.

Tom Ince looks poised to agree a move to Hull City despite the late interest from Stoke.

Ince's father, Paul, is understood to be talking to the club to iron out finer details. The fee would still have to be set by a tribunal with Hull hoping topay around £3m to £4m rather than Blackpool's desired £8m.

Hull remain in the hunt for Dundee United left-back Andrew Robertson and Tottenham centre-back Michael Dawson but West Ham have also shown interest in Dawson. The player has only just bought a new house in London and staying in the capital appeals although he would prefer it was still with Tottenham.

Malaga want Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa to replace Willy Caballero. Malaga's owner has made a last ditch plea to Caballero asking him to stay rather than join Manchester City but the 32-year-old is still expected in Manchester. Ochoa is a free agent after leaving Ajaccio and made a big impression with his acrobatic saves during the World Cup.

Southampton are considering Lorient centre-back Bruno Ecuele Manga.

The
 club are drawing up contingency plans in case they are forced into a 
climb down over Dejan Lovren. Southampton are making plans to rebuild 
their squad and don't intend to sell Lovren even if he goes on strike.

However,
 ultimately that may not prove healthy for the club. Liverpool are 
threatening to move on to other targets if there is no change on Lovren 
soon.

Manga
 ironically was a player watched by Liverpool last year. The 25-year-old
 Gabon international was also a target for Everton. This time round, 
Borussia Monchengladbach and Lazio are also monitoring Manga who was 
Laurent Koscielny's replacement.

Bosnia's World Cup contingent are keen to make the breakthrough into England.

Winger Edin Visca looks a bargain at £1.5million. He has options from Hoffenheim and Stuttgart but is set on a move to England. He has attracted interest from Leicester and Norwich but other English clubs are also weighing up the 24-year-old due to his price and wages.

Muhamed Besic, the 21-year-old holding midfielder from Ferencvaros, is the subject of interest from Swansea, Everton and Aston Villa.

While Anel Hadzic has been offered to Newcastle and Everton but so far Bournemouth and Swansea have shown more interest in the Sturm Graz midfielder.

Aston Villa reserve Andras Streiber, meanwhile, is joining Hungarian club Gyori ETO.
