Miralem Pjanic's second-half double ensured Roma kept up the pressure on Serie A leaders Juventus after beating Inter Milan 4-2 in a thrilling encounter at the Stadio Olimpico on Sunday night.

Pjanic proved to be the difference, with his superb display capped off with a stunning free-kick deep into injury-time as the hosts cut Juventus' lead at the top to just three points.

Rudi Garcia's men got off to the perfect start when they took the lead on 21 minutes, with former Arsenal man Gervinho capitalising on woeful Inter defending to score the opener.

Goals: Gervinho 21, Holebas 47, Pjanic 60, 90

Inter Milan: Handanovic; Campagnaro, Ranocchia, Juan Jesus, Dodo; M'Vila, Medel, Kuzmanovic; Guarin; Palacio, Osvaldo.

Adem Ljajic was able to drift into the area with ease, before cutting the ball back for Gervinho, who had the simplest of tasks as he tapped home from close range. 

The visitors looked for an instant response and just four minutes later were unlucky not to draw level, with Morgan De Sanctis coming to Roma's rescue.

A throw-in caught the hosts completely by surprise and Zdravko Kuzmanovic nearly took full advantage of the defensive lapse, with the midfielder's right-footed effort on goal clawed away by the veteran keeper for a corner.

Up the other end Gervinho had the ball in the back of the net for the second time of the evening - in a near identical scenario to the first goal - but this time it was ruled out for offside.

The 27-year-old was again quickest to react in the box, tapping home from close range following another precise ball across goal, but Gervinho strayed into an offside position before the ball came in.

Despite this Roma remained firmly in the ascendancy, so when Inter got themselves back on level terms on 33 minutes it was well against the run of play.

Andrea Ranocchia rose highest from Kuzmanovic's corner from the left, planting his header into the bottom corner, giving De Sanctis no chance in the Roma goal as they went into the break frustrated on level terms after a dominant first-half display. 

It didn't take long for the hosts to regain their lead after the interval though courtesy of Jose Holebas.

The Greek left-back picked up the ball from Seydou Keita before going on a dazzling run, skipping past two defenders on his way into the penalty area, before firing an unstoppable shot past Samir Handanovic on 47 minutes.

The visitors, though, didn't let the latest setback affect them, with a new-found belief there for all to see since Roberto Mancini has taken over as manager.

Dani Osvaldo - on a season-long loan from Premier League high flyers Southampton - fired the ball home via a deflection off Rannochia to score his sixth goal of the season to make it 2-2 just before the half-hour mark.

It didn't take long for the hosts to regain the lead again though, scoring just three minutes later through Pjanic.

The 24-year-old  reacted quickest after Francesco Totti's shot was blocked, firing home with aplomb to send the home faithful into raptures.

Inter players, as well as Mancini and his coaching staff were incensed though, after what looked like a clear foul on Fredy Guarin from Holebas in the build up to the goal.

Opposite number Rudi Garcia was equally frustrated 10 minutes later after he felt his side should have been awarded a penalty after goalscorer Pjanic went down under the challenge of Juan Jesus.

Inter huffed and puffed in the closing stages but ultimately were unable to get themselves back into the game, with Pjanic capping off a man-of-the-match performance with his second goal of the night deep into stoppage time, with a beautifully lofted free-kick giving Handanovic no chance in the Inter goal.
