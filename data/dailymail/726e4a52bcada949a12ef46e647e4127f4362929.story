Reading have appointed Steve Clarke as the club's new manager, less than 24 hours after Nigel Adkins was removed from the helm.

Clarke, the former West Brom boss and assistant manager at Liverpool and Chelsea, has signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with the Royals.

Adkins had spent just 20 months in charge of the Championship outfit. The former Southampton boss was appointed in March 2013, but results have slumped amid increasingly poor performances, and Saturday's 6-1 loss against Birmingham was the last straw for the club's board.

Clarke, 51, is tasked with salvaging Reading's season and mounting a push for promotion to the Premier League. The Berkshire club are 16th in the Championship and 10 points off a play-off place. 

'I am absolutely delighted to be joining Reading Football Club and I look forward to helping the club move in the right direction,' Clarke told the club's website.

'A big part of the work ahead is on the training ground and I look forward to meeting the players and getting onto the grass with them. There is real potential here and hopefully exciting times ahead for the supporters.' 

While Clarke has just one permanent managerial job on his CV, he does have an extensive background in coaching having worked as an assistant at Chelsea, West Ham and Liverpool.

He was given his maiden head-coaching position at the Baggies and enjoyed success in his first season, guiding the Midlands-based club to their highest-ever Premier League finish of eighth.

Nigel Adkins has been relieved of his duties as Reading manager with immediate effect 

Saturday's loss to Birmingham was Reading's seventh in their last 11 Championship matches

However, Clarke's men toiled at the start of the next campaign and, after winning only seven of their top-flight games in 2013, the Scot was sacked.

But Reading co-chairman Sir John Madejski insists Clarke's body of work in the top flight helped him land his new role.

'He comes with a CV of the very highest order and I look forward to moving back up the table with him in charge,' Madejski added.

'It has been a difficult period for all concerned, but now we can look forwards. Nigel Adkins worked tirelessly to achieve success, sadly it did not work out for him but we wish him, his family and staff well for the future.

'Now we look forward to a new era under Steve's stewardship and I for one am excited about this new beginning.'

Clarke will take charge of his first game this weekend when Reading entertain Watford. 

Adkins, 49, took charge at the Madejski two months after being sacked by Southampton, having led the Saints from League One to the Premier League in successive seasons, but he was unable to prevent Reading from being relegated from the top flight.

They finished seventh in the Championship last season and were only denied a play-off place by Leonardo Ulloa's late winner for Brighton at Nottingham Forest.

Assistant manager Andy Crosby and coach Dean Wilkins left the club along with Adkins.
