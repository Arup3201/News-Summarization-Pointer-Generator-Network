U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice passed up a golden opportunity on Friday to walk back her Sunday television praise for accused Army deserter Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl as an American who had 'served the United States with honor and distinction.'

Rice waded once again into controversy with comments on ABC's Sunday morning news program 'This Week,' setting off an immediate firestorm among Americans who had already learned that Bergdahl was no ordinary hostage overseas.

Taliban forces in Afghanistan turned him over to U.S. Special Forces on Saturday after nearly five years of captivity following his voluntary walk-off from his base near the Pakistan border. The United States released five Taliban terror leaders in exchange, sending them to Qatar for a one-year period of loosely defined house arrest.

An Army-led investigation conducted in the months after Bergdahl's 2009 disappearance determined that he left a remote outpost deliberately an intentionally.

U.S. National security adviser Susan Rice defended her singular praise of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, insisting that she was lauding his decision to enlist in the Army, and not his apparent behavior in Afghanistan

'Honor and distinction': Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl (R) was handed over by the Taliban on Saturday after nearly five years in which he reportedly vacillated between escape attempts and efforts to join in jihad, preceded by a voluntary walk-off from his military outpost

Six soldiers who served in the Bergdahl's platoon said Thursday that they all believed he had willfully deserted the U.S. Army'; We would all die for him,' said one, 'and he left'

According to more recent reports, including one that aired Thursday on the Fox News Channel, Bergdahl became a Musilm during his time with the Taliban, even declaring himself a mujahid – a warrior for Islam.

That revelation put added pressure on Rice to clarify what she had meant.

'I realize there has been lots of discussion and controversy around this,' Rice told CNN during an interview near the 70th anniversary commemoration of the D-Day invasion in Normandy, France.

'But what I was referring to was the fact that this was a young man who volunteered to serve his country in uniform at a time of war. That, in and of itself, is a very honorable thing.'

CNN's Jim Acosta pressed on.

'But "honor and distinction"?' he asked.

'Jim, really,' Rice replied. 'This is a young man whose circumstances we are still going to learn about. He is, as [are] all Americans, innocent until proven guilty.'

President Barack Obama himself used the phrase 'honor and distinction last year to describe a group of 220 Marines, 18 sailors and 3 soldiers who were killed when a Hezbollah suicide bomber attacked a Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon.

On the thirtieth anniversary of that attack, Obama said 'they were faithful to their comrades in arms and served with honor and distinction in the finest tradition of the U.S. military.'

Until Sunday, that was the last time the phrase appeared in official White House transcripts.

Rice chose her words carefully on Friday, but less so on Sunday.

Asked then by host George Stephanopoulos whether she thought Bergdahl would face Army discipline or a court-martial upon his return, Rice said that 'anybody who's been held in those conditions in captivity for five years has paid an extraordinary price. But that is really not the point.'

'The point is, he's back,' Rice declared. 'He's going to be safely reunited with his family. He served the United States with honor and distinction.'

She added that she hoped Bergdahl had 'the opportunity to recover in peace and security and be reunited with his family,' and called it 'such a joyous day.'

White House press secretary Jay Carney declined to answer questions on Monday about Rice's claim, referring reporters' inquiries to the Department of Defense.

Since then, Republicans on Capitol Hill have stepped up their pressure on Rice.

Susan Rice, the president's most trusted national security aide, got in hot water by saying on June 1 that accused war deserter Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl had 'served the United States with honor and distinction'

On Tuesday, New York Rep. Peter King told CNN that the Obama insider's statement made him 'wonder about all the things the president is saying, including the fact he thinks Qatar is going to somehow provide security so these five detainees will not be back on the battlefield.'

On Wednesday, Arkansas Rep. Tom Cotton, who is running for U.S. Senate, said on Fox News that Obama should 'give a full accounting for what he knew and when he knew it, and why he sent Susan Rice on Sunday shows to say he served "with honor and distinction." American people need to know the truth.'

Ohio Sen. Rob Portman piled on a day later, complaining to Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that Rice had pronounced Bergdahl an honorable soldier 'before there is any Army investigation.'

Rice has been a GOP lightning rod since September 2012 when she said on five Sunday political talk shows just days after the Benghazi, Libya terror attack that a spontaneous mob of protesters upset over an American-made anti-Islam video – not armed militants allied with al-Qaeda – had attacked a U.S. diplomatic post.

She worked from a set of 'talking points' that day, an internal summary of messages that the Obama administration found acceptable. It later emerged that officials at the CIA, the State Department and the White House altered those talking points to omit mention of organized terror groups.

The attack and its aftermath came less than two months before President Obama was to stand for re-election – in part, on a message that al-Qaeda was 'on the run.'

Rice, then the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, withdrew her name from consideration for the job of secretary of state months later when Hillary Clinton left the position. Obama later chose her as his national security adviser, a job that doesn't require Senate confirmation.

On Friday she doubled down on the Benghazi controversy, too,

'Are you being up front by the American people,' Acosta asked her, 'or are you being guided by talking points?'

'With Benghazi,' she claimed, as has been recounted on many occasions, I provided the best information that the U.S. government had at the time. Parts of it turned out to be wrong. I regret that the information I was provided was wrong, and that I delivered it to the American people.'

'That doesn't make me a liar. That makes me a public servant trying to say what we knew at the time.'

The first draft of her talking points after the Benghazi attack included a CIA assessment that, 'We do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qaeda participated in the attack.'

Later versions described only an 'on-going' investigation to learn 'who is responsible for the violence.'

The last time the White House cited a soldier's 'honor and distinction' it was in 2013 when Obama lauded 241 U.S. servicemen and women killed by a 1983 Hezbollah suicide bomber

Rice has been a lightning rod for Republicans since her 2012 flawed claims that a terror attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya was actually the work of a spontaneous mob upset about an anti-Islam film made in the US
