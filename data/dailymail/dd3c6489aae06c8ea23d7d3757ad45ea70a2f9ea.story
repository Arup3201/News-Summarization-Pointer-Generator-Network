The inspiration for Sherlock’s new nemesis? Well, that’s elementary.

The show’s co-creator has previously gone on record criticising a certain real-life foreign Press baron who is an unashamed capitalist.

So it was little surprise when Sherlock Holmes’ new enemy was unveiled in last night’s series finale – as a sinister foreign newspaper baron and unashamed capitalist.

The detective describes his enemy Charles Augustus Magnussen – played by Danish actor Lars Mikkelsen – as a ‘shark’ who uncovers secrets about the great and the good which he uses to blackmail them.

He adds: ‘I’ve dealt with murderers, psychopaths, terrorists, serial killers. None of them can turn my stomach like Charles Augustus Magnussen.’

As for the rest of the show, in a dramatic plot twist, Dr John Watson’s new wife, Mary, shoots Sherlock, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, after Magnussen discovers that she had a secret past as an assassin for foreign intelligence agencies. She then steals the identity of a dead woman to marry the detective’s sidekick.

Luckily, she ensures the shot is not fatal, enabling Sherlock to recover and later turn a gun on the villain.

The not-so-subtle depiction of the evil press baron was created by the series’ co-writer, Steven Moffat, who has previously ranted against Right-wing media and declared his dislike of the Conservatives.

In an interview with the Guardian before the last general election in March 2010, he declared: ‘I hope the Tories don’t win. Let’s not beat around the bush.’

Former teacher Mr Moffat also launched a scathing attack on James Murdoch, the son of Rupert Murdoch and the then head News International, which owns The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun.

He said: ‘Are we really going to put James Murdoch in place of [the BBC]? ‘Can you imagine how s*** everything would be? Never mind the fine and glorious things that the BBC does, imagine how s*** everything would be! Stuff would be s***! Let’s not have really good restaurants, let’s have Kentucky Fried Chicken!’

In another possible indication of the views of the show’s creators, Sherlock himself was seen reading a copy of the Guardian during last night’s episode.

And is not the first time the show has
 been accused of blatant Left-wing bias; the previous episode featured a
 thinly veiled attack on Boris Johnson, calling the Mayor of London 
‘dithering, incoherent, and self-interested’.

Mr
 Johnson last week accused the BBC of bias after a spoof newspaper story
 which flashed up briefly on screen during an earlier episode of 
Sherlock.

The mock article revolved around the Mayor of London turning the Thames into a motorway.

Although Mr Johnson was not mentioned by name, the article said that the plans followed a list of ‘bizarre concepts’, including a ‘recently-mocked concept of putting an airport in the middle of the estuary’ – a clear reference to the mayor’s so-called ‘Boris Island’ proposal.

The page included a quote from the ‘current Mayor’ which appeared to mock Mr Johnson’s use of language, finishing with the exclamation ‘huzzar!’

It said: ‘When asked to explain how the system might move forward, or even be profitable, or perhaps even to explain the point, the Mayor, who was at a self-promotion event, was found to be dithering, incoherent, and self-interested’.

Mr Johnson said afterwards: ‘It is elementary my dear Watson, I deduce a simple case of BBC bias.’ He added that spending taxpayers’ money attacking Conservative politicians was the BBC’s ‘raison d’etre’.

The BBC insisted that the newspaper and Mayor featured in the episode were entirely fictional and were not named or ‘politically affiliated.’
