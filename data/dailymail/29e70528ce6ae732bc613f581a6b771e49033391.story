The President of the European Commission has come under fierce scrutiny today after leaked documents show hundreds of firms used Luxembourg tax avoidance deals while he was in charge of the country. 

Jean-Claude Juncker's previous pledge to bring some 'ethics' to Europe's tax laws is now in doubt after the documents showed more than 300 companies such as Burberry, Heinz, Dyson, Pepsi, IKEA and Deutsche Bank were among those to channel funds through the tiny European nation using complex financial structures.

The European Commission said it was already probing the country’s tax practices with a review of Amazon, and would widen this inquiry in the light of new evidence. The leaked papers relate to 340 companies, including Louis Vuitton, Apple, Vodafone, Procter & Gamble and Deutsche Bank. 

It comes just days after Mr Juncker declared he was 'not frightened' of facing down British Prime Minister David Cameron in the latest salvo of what is becoming an increasingly public spat over Britain's EU tax bill.

The so-called 'Luxleaks' documents show that billions of dollars were funneled through Luxembourg, much of it during Mr Juncker's time in charge, thanks to financial structures that allowed companies to slash their tax liabilities, depriving hard-up governments around the world of revenue.

Mr Juncker presided over the tax affairs of Luxembourg for over two decades, transforming the country from a sleepy European backwater to a prized destination where hundreds of the world's biggest companies channel their affairs.

The leaks threaten to undermine his vow to be a more politically involved head of the European Commission, the EU's financial enforcer, especially as he is already embroiled in bitter rows with Cameron and Italy over their budgets.

On Wednesday, asked about the tax policies he once led, Mr Juncker said he 'had his ideas' about the matter but would keep them to himself do nothing to affect the EU's investigation.

The arrangements – used by hundreds of top companies - were signed off by the European Union state and are all legal.

'These revelations are a major blow to the credibility of new commission president Juncker and his capacity to act for the public interest,' said Sven Giegold, of the Greens group in the European Parliament.

Mr Juncker's spokesman said the veteran politician was 'serene' about the revelations, though he pulled out of a public speaking engagement with former commission chief Jacques Delors scheduled later today.

Under an hour-long barrage of questions from reporters, the spokesman stressed that EU regulators were already investigating whether Luxembourg's deals with US Internet giant Amazon and the financial arm of Italian carmaker Fiat amounted to illegal state aid.

Spokesman Margaritis Schinas said that if the EU found it was in breach of the rules 'Luxembourg will have to take corrective actions'.

He added that the EU could widen the probe to companies mentioned in the ICIJ investigation.

The leaked tax papers, analysed by the US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in a six month investigation, totall nearly 28,000 pages connected to more than 1,000 firms.

Mr Cameron and Mr Juncker have been engaged in a bitter dispute in recent weeks as Mr Cameron battles to reduce the £1.7billion surcharge demanded by the EU to cover years of strong economic growth in the UK while Europe struggled.

The Commission president said he was ‘not the type who trembles in front of prime ministers’ and warned Mr Cameron that he had ‘a problem’ with other EU leaders.

The Prime Minister was stung last month after the budget demand was leaked during a Brussels summit. He has vowed not to pay ‘anything like’ the £1.7billion being demanded by Brussels by December 1.

But the revelations are predicted to trigger more calls for politicians to work harder to stop firms taking advantage of international tax rules avoid their tax bills.

The Guardian reported last night that Dyson had set up companies in the Isle of Man and Luxembourg to put £300m of internal loans into its UK operations in 2011. The interest payments made on the loans were taxed at only around one per cent in Luxembourg – saving the firm millions.

The newspaper also said drugs firm Shire and city trading company Icap had also cut their tax bills with help from Luxembourg.

The Guardian said the leaked papers showed 'Luxembourg was acting as a go-between, both enabling and masking tax avoidance, which always takes place beyond its borders'.

In its investigation, the ICIJ said global accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers had helped multinationals in question secure at least 548 tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010.

The documents uncovered details of so-called Advance Tax Agreements - pre-negotiated deals which set out how companies will be taxed, the same practice that the EU is investigating in the Amazon and Fiat cases.

'It's like taking your tax plan to the government and getting it blessed ahead of time,' the ICIJ quoted Connecticut School of Law tax expert Richard Pomp as saying.

The EU has no power over member states' tax affairs as such, but it can probe whether they amount to illegal state aid, which breaches the 28-nation bloc's single market rules.

Similar cases have been opened against Ireland for tax deals with tech giant Apple and the Netherlands with coffee chain Starbucks.

The ICIJ said its investigation had involved a team of more than 80 journalists from 26 countries working for outlets including The Guardian, Le Monde and Germany's Suddeutsche Zeitung.

The Guardian acknowledged in its report of the investigation that the Luxembourg arrangements were 'perfectly legal' but noted that they were enabling tax avoidance on 'an industrial scale'.

Other companies that benefited from the schemes included Burberry, Procter & Gamble, Heinz, JP Morgan and FedEx.

The ICIJ said some companies had been able to achieve effective tax rates of less than one percent on profits channelled through Luxembourg.

Stephen Shay, a Harvard Law School professor who has held senior tax roles in the US Treasury, said: 'Clearly the database is evidencing a pervasive enabling by Luxembourg of multinationals' avoidance of taxes [around the world].'

He described Luxembourg as being 'like a magical fairyland.'

It comes as only last week Prime Minister David Cameron told business leaders he would not tolerate large multinational firms avoiding tax.

Mr Cameron said: 'We've cut the rate of corporation tax down to 20 per cent, we're the most competitive place to come and start a business, but here's the deal – if they have a low tax rate, those companies have damn well got to pay it.'

And George Osborne is next month expected to announce new measures to stop such businesses diverting its money offshore.

Juncker this summer pledged to 'try to put some morality, some ethics, into the European tax landscape'. He has also insisted the country was not a tax haven, The Guardian reported.

The newspaper said the findings were put to Shire, Icap and Dyson but all three declined to answer questions and instead issued statements saying they do not engage in tax avoidance and they pay tax in the countries where profits are made.

It was also reported last night that a joint venture between the Guardian Media Group and private equity group Apax Partners in 2008 also used a Luxembourg structure when it invested in magazine and events group Emap, now Top Right.

A spokesman for GMG said: 'We partnered with a private equity company which regularly used such structures. A Luxembourg entity was used because Apax already had that structure in place. The fact that the parent company is a Luxembourg company does not give rise to any UK corporation tax savings for GMG.'

Executives including Justin King, the former chief executive of Sainsbury's, have appeared to defend the multinationals.

Mr King, who left the supermarket giant in July, said the situation was 'not black and white' and that, if people did not like the tax methods used by a particular firm, they should shop elsewhere.

He said: 'They are not loopholes. They are legitimate tax systems put in place by legitimate governments legitimately elected.

Taxing question: Last month, it emerged that Facebook had not paid any corporation tax in the UK for a second year in a row, despite recording sales of £50million

'It is wrong to lay that at the door of companies operating their business in a structure… constructed by government.

'The first thing you have got to do is hold governments to account for putting those structures in place; that we have seen in Ireland.

'The Irish have come to the conclusion that the 'double Irish' is not acceptable in their own parliament.'

Last month, it emerged that Facebook had not paid any corporation tax in the UK for a second year in a row, despite recording sales of £50million, after pushing much of its revenues through a complex scheme in Ireland.
