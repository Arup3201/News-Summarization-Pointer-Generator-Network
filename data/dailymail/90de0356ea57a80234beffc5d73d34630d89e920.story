When one mingles with the locals, it’s tempting to try out the lingo.

So yesterday Prince Charles, battling jetlag on his tour Down Under, jokingly admitted that he felt ‘a few sausages short of a barbecue’.

The prince made his wisecrack on the first day of his Diamond Jubilee tour of Australia with his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall.

Camilla has never been to the country 
before and was given the full Outback experience yesterday, meeting a 
kangaroo, encountering some flying doctors and joining a local ‘barbie’.

Her husband embraced the culture 
equally enthusiastically by wearing an Akubra –  a traditional bush hat –
 and joking about having his jar of Jubilee marmite confiscated at the 
airport.

The only thing missing was a koala – but, according to aides, that comes when they visit Adelaide tomorrow.

The couple’s first stop on their 
six-day tour was rural Longreach in Queensland, with a population of 
just 2,976. Camilla had hardly set foot on the dusty red soil of central
 Australia when she was introduced to an orphaned kangaroo called Rooby 
Blue.

The duchess was clearly thrilled  when
 she got to hold the joey – who was wrapped in a cloth bag to mimic her 
mother’s pouch – declaring: ‘Oh hello. Very friendly. Doesn’t it look 
pretty?’

Rooby Blue was found at the side of a road in the pouch of her mother, who was killed after bounding into the path of a lorry.

Camilla appeared concerned about the 
joey’s progress but was relieved to hear she was recovering well from 
her injuries and shock. The orphan should be released into the wild 
after a few more months.

Charles also took an interest in Rooby Blue and gave her a pat on the head, prompting his wife to say: ‘That’s  so sweet.’

Farmer Carley Walker, 33, who is 
helping nurse the joey back to health, said of the meeting with Camilla:
 ‘Rooby is a redhead, so she is by nature temperamental. I wasn’t sure 
if she would pop out of the pouch or kick out, but it went very well.’

Fresh from a stay at a holistic retreat in Bangalore, India, Camilla has looked fresh-faced and healthy on the first leg of a Diamond Jubilee Tour with her husband Prince Charles

As temperatures soared to more than 
40C (104F), Charles named a new plane for the Royal Flying Doctor 
Service and enjoyed a tour of the Stockman’s Hall of Fame, officially 
opened by the Queen in 1988, which showcases the history and culture of 
life in rural Australia.

The prince and his wife chatted to farming families – and Charles was quick to share a joke with them.

‘I’m so jetlagged that I feel a few sausages short of a barbie,’ he said, dipping into Australian slang.

He added: ‘I’m so pleased our visit 
could begin here in rural Queensland. The Outback remains a source of 
fascination and respect.’

Crowds gathered to greet Charles and Camilla as they were driven to a welcome ceremony at the Sir John Guise Stadium during their tour of Papua New Guinea

He told the crowd of his time in 
Australia during his younger years, dealing with snakes and kangaroos – 
recalling how the ’roos used to overtake him on cross-country runs.

Charles and Camilla flew to Australia 
yesterday after spending the first two days of their tour in Papua New 
Guinea. The only hiccup was when their limousine broke down on the way 
to the airport to fly to Australia.

The couple waited in the car for a few
 minutes in the hope that it could be mended but eventually transferred 
to another car in their convoy.

The couple’s trip will take them on to Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney before they fly on to New Zealand.
