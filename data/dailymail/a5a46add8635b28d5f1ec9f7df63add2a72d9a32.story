The teenage daughter of one of Australia's richest men is challenging her father's will in court after claiming she is entitled to a $2.5 million house, a $100,000 wedding, a diamond encrusted grand piano and two cars.

Olivia Jacqueline Mead, 19, claims that a $3 million trust fund left to her when her iron ore magnate father Michael Wright died in 2012 is inadequate, The Australian reports.

Mr Wright was estimated to be worth $1.5 billion when he died and was the son of Peter Wright, who co-founded Hancock Prospecting and Wright Prospecting with Lang Hancock - Gina Rinehart's father.

The late mining heir was married four times and fathered three children, two of whom are involved in the Western ­Australia family business.

Ms Mead is now suing her father's other two children  - Leonie Baldock and ­Alexandra Burt - and the executor of her father's will, David Lemon.

In a summons filed in December 2012, Ms Mead claims to have been left without adequate funds for her proper maintenance, support, education and advancement in life from her father's estate.

The matter was heard in the Supreme Court of Western Australia on Monday. 

The 19-year-old claims she will need a home five times the Perth median price ($2.5 million), $10,000 each year for fashion accessories including Tiffany and Co sunglasses and $100,000 for a wedding when she ties the knot.

Her list of claims also included an Audi A4 and a Toyota Tarago for when she has children, as well as a diamond-encrusted bass guitar worth $250,000 and a limited ­edition Kuhn Bosendorfer grand piano. 

Ms Mead is now suing her father's other two children - Leonie Baldock and ­Alexandra Burt - and the executor of her father's will, David Lemon. The matter was heard in the Supreme Court of Western Australia on Monday

Ms Mead claimed in court she will need $300 a week for utilities, $800 a week for food and alcohol, $150 a week for fine wine and $300 a week for clothing.

The university student, who appeared in court on Monday, said her relationship with her father was 'sporadic'.

The defendants in the matter are executor David  Lemon, Leonie Angela Maynard Baldock, Alexandra Odette Burt and VOC Group Ltd.

Ms Baldock, who is also Mr Wright's daughter, took over the reins at Wright Prospecting shortly after he died when she was aged 40.

The VOC Group is related to the Voyager Estate winery in Margaret River bought by Mr Wright - who was reportedly not a drinker - in 1991.

The matter continues in the WA Supreme Court.
