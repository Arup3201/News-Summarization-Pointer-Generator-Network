They're the young model couple who live together, play together and, now work together too.

As members of one of the world's biggest modelling agencies, Pixie Lott and Oliver Cheshire have combined work with pleasure by posing for a loved-up shoot.

The couple's agency, Select Model Management, have released the candid snaps of pair, who have been dating for over four years.

World's best looking couple? Oliver and Pixie, who have been dating for over four years, posed for some sultry snaps released by their agency, Select Model Management, which were taken when they holidayed in Mallorca

Pixie, 23, wears her hair in its natural
 curly waves with barely-there make-up, while Oliver has a healthy 
summer glow and wears his hair in its trademark swept over style.

Oliver, who is a style writer for The Telegraph, shows off washboard abs in a series of topless photos released by his agency, which David Gandy is also on the books of.

The happy couple looked like they were 
still very much in the honeymoon period as they strolled hand in hand 
along the beach in a few weeks ago.

Just taking a quick dip: Oliver, who is represented by Select Men, along with David Gandy, has worked on numerous high fashion campaigns

Despite being together for nearly a half a decade, Pixie recently admitted that the pair are in no rush to walk down the aisle.

The
 Mama Do singer told MailOnline: ‘Everyone’s different, everyone’s ready
 at different times. My sister got married last year so I feel like all that 
attention has been on her rather than pressure on me.

'There’s
 so much I want to do first and Oliver has things he’s doing in his 
career so while I want to get married and have babies in my lifetime, 
it’s not happening right now. I still have so much to focus on before 
that’.

Speaking
 about how her boyfriend plays a huge part in her music, Pixie told Look
 magazine: ‘He makes me so happy, but I’ve imagined what it would be 
like if we broke up - awful - and it inspired some of the ballads on the
 album, like Break Up Song.'

Pixie's latest single, Lay Me Down, is currently doing well in the charts, and she will next be performing at V Festival on August 16.

Her
 music comeback has been keeping her busy. Last night she attended two 
events to launch her album and on Tuesday evening, Pixie hosted an 
exclusive performance of her new self-titled album alongside Pandora at 
the Langham Hotel.

Speaking
 at the launch, she said: 'I'm thrilled to be launching my third album, 
and excited to be working with Pandora on the launch, which is going to 
be a fun evening.'
