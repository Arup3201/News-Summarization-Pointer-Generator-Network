UKIP supporters have been labelled 'fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists' and one fan of Nigel Farage is doing little to dispel the idea.

Jill, 59, a former nurse from Poole in Dorset, has told a Channel 5 documentary that she believes in angels and thinks the European Union plans to kill people with guillotines.

She believes UKIP leader Farage, 50, is our only hope.

Jill, pictured left at her home in Poole, believes UKIP leader Nigel Farage, pictured right at his party's spring conference in Margate last week, has been sent from god to save us from a foreign invasion

'I think Nigel Farage has been sent by God, he probably doesn't realise it,' she reveals on TV show Farage Fans & UKIP Lovers, that will air on Channel 5 this evening.

'God says when an enemy comes against you like a massive flood, I'll send someone to give you some protection. 

'I think Nigel Farage is sent to protect us against the EU, he wants to bring England back to the English people and stop this foreign invasion of our borders.'

Offering her thoughts on why the EU is such a threat, Jill said: 'What Nigel Farage will do by getting us out of the EU is to stop their plans to microchip our people.

Jill told a Channel 5 documentary that she thinks the EU have 'death vans' and they will cut people's heads off with guillotines if they refuse to have microchips fitted

'The EU already has the equipment set up and they have death vans like they have in China, equipped with guillotines. 

'They will be sent to houses and work places basically saying receive the microchip or be killed. So off with your head and that's when things start getting unpleasant.'

Jill - who says she once saw an angel in Tesco Express - doesn't just think Farage will save the nation with his foreign policies.

She also believes UKIP is helping Brits become more liberated in the bedroom. She's a fan of bondage herself and says she has met many UKIP supporters who share her fondness for S&M.

She said: 'I would love a cabinet position as head of bondage. It's my hobby and I do enjoy it, it's all role-play and froth, it's a natural English phenomenon to like it.

'Sometimes I like to be submissive and other times dominant. I have met a lot of UKIP supporters who are into BDSM. They do seem to have a natural bent towards bondage.

'I do think that Nigel Farage has bought a new era and openess to England where we can be more open about our needs to have our bottoms spanked.'

The bondage enthusiast also believes UKIP can enhance the NHS by giving free cosmetic surgery to women who want it, like herself.

'I have been a nurse most of my life, I have my views about the NHS. I think people who need big breasts, who need their nose done, should receive help from the state,' Jill said.

'I think Nigel should look into this. I want big breasts. I have seen my surgeon and I am going to have implants. 

'I think I should get them on the NHS. Nigel could get a higher women's vote by bringing that into play.'
