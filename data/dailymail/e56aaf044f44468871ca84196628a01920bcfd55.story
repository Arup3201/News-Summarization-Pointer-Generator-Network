A group of students who came up with an electrically conductive paint for an art project using research from Wikipedia are seeing their product take off around the the world.

Four years ago the Royal College of Art students created the substance that allows you to paint working light switch directly onto your wall, without any need for sockets, cables or wiring.

The paint acts as a form of liquid wiring and, unlike conventional wires, it can be applied to almost any surface, including paper, plastic, metal and even fabric.

A group of Royal College of Art students created this Marmite-like substance that allows you to paint liquid wiring onto any surface

Bare Conductive's House Kit contains two paper houses, wired with conductive paint, which light up in the dark

The product has the appearance and consistency of runny Marmite, but dries quickly when exposed to the air.

Its inventors, RCA graduates Isabel Lizardi, Matt Johnson, Bibi Nelson and Becky Pilditch, call their creation 'Bare Paint.'

While they don't claim to be the first group to have invented a conductive ink, they are pioneering new ways it can be used, CNN reported.

Matt Johnson said: 'We started this project in earnest in 2009. We were originally interested in trying to apply electronics to the skin... so we arrived at this idea of applying them as a coating and eventually we got this idea of a conductive paint.

'In 2008 -- and probably still today -- there was a lot of work around electronic textiles. And though we really liked the idea of having a jumper (a piece of clothing) that has some intelligence in it, we didn't like that it was so bulky and that once you took it off the functionality disappeared.'

Around the same time there was a lot of 'extreme work' being done by people who were injecting electronics beneath the skin. For their final project, the RCA students began work on making something less intrusive, looking for a substance that could be painted onto the body.

Bare Conductive's Matt Johnson travelled to Budapest Design Week and ran a workshop with University students at the Bloodmountain Foundation

DJ and producer Calvin Harris mounted a project with Bare Conductive, with painted dancers whose movements triggered loops from Harris's hit song Ready for the Weekend

Designer Patrick Stevenson-Keating developed a conductive paint-powered lamp for the 2012 Milan Furniture Fair. The lamp consists of a layer of liquid paint suspended in oil

Mr Johnson said: 'That idea transformed into the material we have now, which is very safe though it's not specifically intended for the body anymore.'

After graduating from college, the team collaborated on a video for DJ and producer Calvin Harris.

The resulting project was the 'Humanthesizer,' a performance which literally brought the paint to life, with dancers whose movements triggered audio loops from Harris's song 'Ready for the Weekend.'

The company has created a collection of prototype posters that respond to touch. When activated, the posters play audio, which they hope might be used in poster campaigns promoting festivals, music, TV shows and film

Matt Johnson, co-inventor of Bare Conductive, said: 'Making a new material was a bit daunting for four designers.'

So, the team went on Wikipedia. According to Johnson, the online encyclopedia provided them with almost everything they needed to know about crafting conductive materials.

Once the paint's formula was finalised, co-creator Isabel Lizardi says the team began to consider how it might be applied to real-world products.

The first thing they launched was the paint in its raw form, which they made available to other garden-shed inventors, CNN reported.

Today, Bare Paint jars and pens are sold on the internet and stocked by electronics stores around the world. Projects being done by Bare Paint users include everything from interactive color wheels to homemade electric toys.

Mr Johnson said that conductive paint opens up an enormous range of creative opportunities.

As conductive paint becomes increasingly common, we can look forward to a future where billboards talk back, walls are interactive, and greeting cards come to life in our very hands.

Mr Johnson added: 'Devices no longer have to look high tech to be high tech. Our goal is to put interactivity onto objects you don't expect.'
