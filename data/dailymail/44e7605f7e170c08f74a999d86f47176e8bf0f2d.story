Face of innocence: Angel Mauro Cortez Nava was shot down and killed as he was cradled in his father's arms

A 14-month-old toddler has been gunned down outside his parent's house after his father was targeted for wearing purple clothing.

Angel Mauro Cortez Nava was the innocent victim of a gang-related feud on Monday night in the Watts area of Los Angeles when he was murdered as Mauro Cortez, 24, cradled him on the pavement.

Mr Cortez was wearing a purple top - a colour associated with one of two gangs that have been involved in a long-running and deadly feud.

Neighbours say Mr Cortez has nothing to do with gang crime.

Police are now searching for the killer who was a hoodie-wearing teenager and fired several shots as he rode by, injuring Mr Cortez.

Mauro Jr was shot in the stomach and 
rushed to hospital but died following surgery while his father was 
struck in the shoulder and released yesterday.

Police have not released a motive but neighbours and relatives all believe it could be a gang feud.

Cortez,
who is from Mexico, told the LA Times through an interpreter that he 
was devastated and his son was everything to him. He asked for help from
the public but added that he is scared.

Marcus Williams, who lives nearby, 
said: 'I have seen plenty of people pass away here. For a child to go, 
this has to stop immediately.

'When
a child, a child, a baby, this kid didn't have a chance at life. It 
really hurt. I'm afraid to let my kids play in the yard now. This is 
right across the street.'.

A 
$50,000 reward has now been put up by the city council for anyone with 
information leading to the suspect's conviction. The Los Angeles Kings 
has also said it will offer the same amount.

A
sign was erected on the fence outside the boy's home which said 'Angel 
Maro Cortez Nava', and listed his date of birth and death.

KTLA-5 has also got video that shows a
display of photos of him as a newborn baby and on a rocking horse along
with the words 'We Love You'.

The attacker was black and the father 
is Latino, authorities said. Neighbours added that they have been caught
in the crossfire of a six-month turf war between Fudgetown, a black 
gang, and the Hispanic Barrio Grape Street gang.

Tim Leiweke, president of the group that owns the Kings, said the team was offering the reward 'to make sure everyone knows this is unacceptable in our city.'

Cortez was wearing a purple shirt when the shooting took place, a colour some associate with the Barrio Grape Street gang, the Times said. Grape Street is one block west of Hickory.

Cortez is an immigrant from Jalisco, Mexico, who did odd jobs, friends and relatives told the Times.

When he showed up three years ago, the Cervantes family took him in, matriarch Sara Cervantes said.

Cortez had nothing to do with any gang, neighbours said. He got married and in 2011, Angel was born.

'He
was always here playing with the baby. The baby was his life,' said 
Maria Trujillo, another member of the family. 'With these shootings 
going on, you don't feel safe in your own front yard,' she added.

'There
was a shooting around over there on the corner a block away; one on 
Wilmington, and another up around the corner,' said Miguel Medina, an 
unemployed construction worker who has lived on the street for five 
years. 'When I came here it was calm, but then six months ago they began
killing each other.'

Police chief Charlie Beck said it was 'an awful tragedy' that had unsettled the highest ranks of the police department.

Tensions in the neighbourhood have been high with more than half a dozen killings in the last year.

He
said: 'Gang violence touches everybody,' he said. 'People have to 
understand that even though gang members may target each other, victims 
cross a wide, broad swath. It's extremely unfortunate.'
