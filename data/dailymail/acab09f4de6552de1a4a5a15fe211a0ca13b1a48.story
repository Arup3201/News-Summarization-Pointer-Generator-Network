A multi-million pound visitor centre at one of Scotland's most famous beaches has been rejected - after fears that the sight of it would irritate golfers at St Andrews iconic Old Course.

The trust behind the plans behind the visitor centre which was to look like dunes said councillors had turned down the opportunity to replace 'third-world facilities' for the public in favour of the 'golfing elite'.

A building described as 'iconic' and 'radical' would have housed a visitor centre, new cafe and toilets on the West Sands in St Andrews.

A new lifeguard station, recreational area and boardwalk were also to be created.

Fife Coast and Countryside Trust was denied planning consent for its ambitious development, resulting in the loss of cash promised from several sources, including £1.3m from the Coastal Communities Fund in the last year such funds were available.

The Coastal Communities Fund's deadline for applications has now passed.

Chief executive of Fife and Coast Countryside Trust, Amanda McFarlane and Tom Morton, the architect behind the design deemed unacceptable, hit out at councillors.

Mr Morton, of Arc Architects, said the debate focused on how the development might disturb the view of golfers even though it would have been hidden behind a five-metre dune.

Plans for re-development of the public area at West Sands have fallen through because of golfers' complaints

He said: 'There was no discussion of the benefits of the project in improving management of the beach and public safety, the educational facilities for schoolchildren, the support it would have given to local volunteer groups and businesses and the new jobs created by a £1.6m improvement in public facilities for visitors to the beach.

'This decision means that St Andrews is destined for the foreseeable future to have extensive luxury facilities for the golfing elite looking out over decrepit, third-world facilities for the general public.'

CEO Amanda McFarlane said she was 'gutted' by the outcome.

She added: 'We now have to go back to our funders and tell them we don't want their £1.6m.'

The new visitor centre would have added jobs as well as excellent public amenities to West Sands

The 32ft double bowl-shaped centre was designed to look like overlapping waves or dunes.

The design and size of the proposed visitor centre was deemed unacceptable, partly because of the impact on views for golfers on the adjacent Old Course - the oldest golf course in the world.

In an objection penned to Fife Council, St Andrews Links Trust CEO Euan Loudon said: 'Aspects of this development have the potential to damage the authenticity and reputation of the golf course experience.'

The final say fell to St Andrews councillor and former Fife provost Frances Melville, as the committee was split 50-50 and her casting vote blackballed the 9.5 metre-high building, which planning officers described as striking, unique and iconic.

While the Old Course will continue to have luxurious facilities...

Despite being a major attraction in the popular tourist town, the beach - which starred in the opening scenes of the 1981 Chariots of Fire film - has run-down toilets and a cafe open only on a seasonal basis.

Mrs McFarlane said: 'The project would have created eight new jobs, 22 indirect jobs and helped to safeguard over 1,400 tourism related jobs.'

Cupar councillor Bryan Poole tried to persuade the committee to approve the 'radical' design.

Mr Poole said: 'The mistake would be to look at it from the point of view of golfers because it is for the people using the beach.

...the general public will have to settle for more simplistic amenities

'I really think it is a radical design. It will replace two pretty decrepit buildings which are of no value at all.'

He was backed by Councillor Donald Lothian, who said a 'leap of faith' was required.

Although she admitted there was a need for new facilities, Mrs Melville highlighted the many tournaments staged at the Old Course, which is due to host the British Open again next year, and said other buildings in the 'flattish' landscape were 'not very high'.

She said: 'There are too many issues. Due to the design, height and visual impact, I'm uncomfortable with it.'

Several councillors abstained from the vote due to a conflict of interests, leaving the decision to eight members.
