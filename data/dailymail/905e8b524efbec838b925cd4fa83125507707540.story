The Cincinnati Police Department is embroiled in scandal after one of the force’s most visible officers was indicted Monday for sexting with a minor and setting up an unauthorized police substation.

Darrell Beavers, 44, has been accused of receiving nude photos of a 17-year-old girl he was mentoring, as well as turning an apartment into a police sub-station without permission of the Cincinnati Police Department. 

Mr Beavers, a former NFL player, is well-known in the southern Ohio city for being a highly commended cop who a spends significant amount of time with inner-city youth as both a mentor and at a summer camp.

Fallen: Darrell Beavers is accused of sexting a minor, destroying the evidence and establishing a rogue police substation

The young girl engaging in lewd contact with the disgraced cop was a member of the ‘Police Explorer’ program designed to pair teens interested in a career in law enforcement with seasoned cops who can show them the ropes, according to reports.

An investigation into the 12 year CPD veteran’s conduct began last month after the teenager’s father discovered inappropriate messages sent between the Mr Beavers and his daughter, according to the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office.

Investigators soon discovered the underage girl had sent nude photos of herself to the disgraced cop’s cell phone, which he destroyed after finding out he was under investigation, officials said.

The once-respected cop was highly commended and often exceeded expectations in most performance metrics tracked by the CPD, according to WCPO.

‘He's been a generally good employee,’ Assistant Police Chief Lt. Col. James Whalen told the station, adding that ‘this is obviously very disappointing.’

A neighborhood liaison since 2010, Mr Beavers has earned 10 commendations during his time on the force, WCPO reported.

‘We’re very disappointed with this set of facts that brought rise to this situation,’ Mr Whalen told the Cincinnati Enquirer.

The illicit contact took place between June and September of this year, officials said.

Additionally, the investigation into Mr Beavers’ sexscapades also discovered an unauthorized CPD substation set up in an apartment complex on the outskirts of the city, authorities said.

In place since earlier this year in Cincinnati’s East Price Hill neighborhood, the rogue outpost contained a mattress, bedding, food, lubricant, videos and a CPD-issued night vision camera, officials said.

It looked legit: Both the complex manager and residents believed the outpost was on the up-and-up, it even had an official CPD decal in the window

Mr Beavers was able to secure the flop house for free by masquerading it is an official CPD substation, according to WEWS. 

He approached complex manager Marti Burcham in full uniform and even instructed her to place a CPD decal in the window, she told WCPO.

‘I saw him move stuff in, a computer and stuff like that, and he hung the sign on the window, so I thought it was all perfectly legit,’ Ms Burcham said.

A resident of the grim-looking complex told WCPO she felt it was good for the area, but soon had reservations about its legitimacy.

‘When I first heard that there was going to be a substation in our complex, I thought it was a really nice idea,’ the resident said.

‘They were never there, it seemed like if there was going to be some police presence in the neighborhood at least they would be there on occasion,’ Kathy added. ‘An hour here and an hour there, but it really didn't appear that way to me.’

Highly-visible: Mr Beavers has spoken multiple times in the media about his outreach work with city youths

‘A police officer commands, and should command, the respect of the entire community,’ Hamilton County Prosecutor Joseph Deters said in a statement. 

‘When an individual police officer betrays that trust, it devastates the entire community which is why the Cincinnati Police Department and my office place the highest priority on these types of cases and will not tolerate this behaviour,’ Mr Deters added.

The condemned cop faces six felony charges, including theft in office, tampering with evidence and four counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance, officials said.

Making matters worse, Mr Beavers is known through the community for his work with troubled youth.

The congenial officer has participated in Camp Joy, in rural Clarksville, OH, for several years, according to WCPO.

He was even a youth camp counselor: Mr Beavers spent the past several summers at a camp for inner-city youths

Camp Joy pairs inner-city youngsters ages 10 to 12 with police officers with the hopes of getting to them before the streets do, a partnership that has existed since 1969, the station said.

‘Once they've reached a certain age, it's kind of hard to grasp, to bring them back,’ Mr Beavers told the station last year.

‘If you can save them now, you can talk to them now, you can probably reach out and be able to change a lot of their behaviour,’ he added.

Mr Beavers told the station how many inner-city children who turn to a path of crime and drugs are often victims of their own environment, and that the camp teaches them to trust police.

‘You shouldn't be afraid of the police,’ said Mr Burcham. ‘We're the ones we want you to come to if you're in need, we want you to come to us.’

The former Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs player faces over eight years in prison if convicted. He is currently suspended without pay.
