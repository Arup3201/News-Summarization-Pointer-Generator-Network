Britain’s best hotels are getting a run for their money from pubs and restaurants in the 2015 edition of the Good Hotel Guide.

Pubs and restaurants with rooms are vying with top-notch hotels as the best places to stay, with several establishments included in the latest guide.

One of the top gongs in the book’s annual Cesar Awards – named after legendary Swiss hotelier Cesar Ritz – was awarded to The Talbot Inn, which serves as a watering hole for locals at Mells, Somerset, but has eight guest rooms for visitors.

Surrounded by Somerset’s stunning countryside, The Talbot Inn won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year.

It is described as a traditional yet stylish coaching inn with all the comforts of a smart hotel plus a classic pub, grill room, 500-year-old sitting room and garden. 

There are more than 400 entries in the latest guide, which acts as a bible for the UK’s hotel industry.

Its editors say the guide is independent and all the hotels and B&Bs are recommended by readers, with anonymous inspections done by the editorial team.

Nine other Cesar Awards were handed out. ‘Unstuffy and impeccable’ Lords of the Manor at Upper Slaughter, Gloucestershire, won Country House Hotel of the Year, while The Pear Tree at Purton in Purton, Wiltshire, was the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ and ‘superb cuisine’.

For families, Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was rated the top place to take the kids. It served as the inspiration for Toad’s stately home in The Wind in the Willows.

With no signals for television, radio or wifi, Scotland's Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station was named Newcomer of the Year.

Co-editors Adam Raphael and Desmond Balmer said in a statement: ‘Our choices reflect the changing face of hospitality. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are listed alongside simple B&Bs, as well as many full-service hotels.’

They said: ‘Hotels should be better than home. A good manager will have slept in every bedroom to ensure it’s up to scratch.

‘Breakfast is also a very good benchmark. It’s the guest’s last meal before check out, so good-quality coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice and free-range eggs should be a given.

'Finally, the guest may not always be right, but they should always come first.’
