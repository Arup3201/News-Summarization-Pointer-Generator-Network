Russia's ambassador to Denmark  Mikhail Vanin made the controversial remarks

Swedish authorities have been smoking too much cannabis – that's according to Russia's ambassador to Denmark, who was trying to make light of their concerns over a Russian military jet's alleged near-miss with a passenger plane.

Mikhail Vanin, Russia's ambassador in Copenhagen, told Berlingske daily: 'The Swedish authorities also recently said there was a submarine in their waters. There wasn't.

'Now they say again that they have seen something. I'm afraid the Swedes visit Pusher Street very often,' he said, referring to the Christiania neighbourhood in Copenhagen known for its cannabis trade.

Swedish military said that a Russian military jet on Friday nearly collided with a commercial passenger plane south of the Swedish city of Malmoe, shortly after taking off from Copenhagen International Airport.

Swedish and Danish fighter jets were scrambled in response to the Russian plane, which came dangerously close to the passenger jet at less than nine kilometres (six miles), according to the Swedish military.

Russia replied that their plane was 'more than 70 kilometres' (43 miles) away.

The incident happened amid growing concern in the Baltic region over signs of more assertive Russian behaviour, including Russian planes regularly skirting or violating the air space of neighbouring countries.

For the second time this year, a Russian military aircraft turned off its transponders to avoid commercial radar and nearly collided with a passenger jet over Sweden, officials have revealed; pictured above is a Russian fighter jet which was spotted off the coast of Norway in 2007

Sweden and Denmark summoned Russia's ambassadors on Monday to protest the incident.

The Russian ambassador admitted Russian planes were patrolling the area more frequently than they used to, but said that was probably 'a response to NATO's activities and escalation in the region.'

'I'm sure that if NATO reduces its activities in the region, we will do the same. Do not provoke the Russian bear,' Vanin said.

Sweden's claims were part of 'a very well-orchestrated campaign' to portray Russia as 'a very dangerous neighbour', he said.

'But it's a very dangerous path that Swedish and some Danish campaigners have embarked on,' he added.

Sweden, which is not a member of NATO, has said there is evidence that a mini submarine entered its waters in October, but that it hasn't been possible to confirm the vessel's nationality.

In September, Stockholm lodged a protest with Moscow after the incursion of two Russian fighter planes into the Nordic country's airspace.

Following the incident on Friday Swedish Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist told a local radio station: 'This is serious. This is inappropriate. This is outright dangerous when you turn off the transponder.'

In October RAF Typhoon jets were scrambled to track this Russian Tu-95 Bear H bomber, one of two which flew close to Britain without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers. Some 26 intercepts were made in around 24 hours

Officials at Russia's Ministry of Defense in Moscow were not immediately available to comment.

Sweden's air force chief, Major General Micael Byden, said the incident in international air space looked 'pretty serious,' adding the southern-bound commercial flight was immediately ordered to change course.

Swedish fighter jets were sent up to identify the aircraft, and later confirmed it as a Russian intelligence plane. 

Media in Sweden and Denmark said the commercial plane was en route to Poland, but the carrier and the number of passengers it has on board has not been reported. 

Byden said this was not as serious as in March when a Russian plane flying without transponders came within 300 feet of an SAS plane that had taken off from Copenhagen.

In recent months, Russia has increased its military presence in the Baltic Sea area, prompting some Swedish officials to compare it to the Cold War

In October, non-NATO Sweden launched its first submarine hunt since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Swedish authorities said a small, foreign submarine had entered its waters illegally but never found it and didn't disclose its nationality

NATO has air patrols over the Baltic Sea and the continuous rotation of NATO military units in and out of countries such as the Baltic states and Poland.
