A father cheered on the touchline as he watched his son score a crucial goal - before collapsing and suffering a fatal heart attack.

Mark Wildsmith, 45, of Barnsley, south Yorkshire, had just been celebrating his 15-year-old son, Liam, scoring a late equaliser in a Sunday league match when he slumped to the ground.

His wife, Diane, and son looked on in horror as Mr Wildsmith's friend Mark Haran performed CPR, but he had suffered a severe heart attack and died later in hospital.

Tributes to a football fan: Mr Wildsmith's widow, Diane, 43, said he had two loves: family and football

Stainless steel worker Mr Wildsmith, who suffered from high blood 
pressure but was in otherwise good health, was watching his son, who plays for Hoyland Town Magpies in their match against Treeton Terriers at Elsecar Cricket Club in 
Barnsley last Sunday when he collapsed.

Liam said: 'It was an important game - we were fighting for our chance to go up to the second division.

'At the time we were down 2-1, then I scored the equaliser and my dad was really proud - you could see he was.

'But then I heard someone say "Liam, your dad’s ill", and I saw him on the floor.  At first I thought he must be being sick or something.

'But then I saw his best mate was trying to do CPR on him and I knew it was serious.'

Mrs Wildsmith, 45, said: 'When he went down, everything froze - time just stood still.

'It felt like hours waiting for the paramedics to arrive, but I was told afterwards that the ambulance arrived within four minutes.'

Mrs Wildsmith said she was glad that she and Liam were with her husband, holding his hands, 'until the end'

She added: 'The only silver lining was that all his family were at the game, a lot of his friends were there, his son was there - whom he was so proud of for scoring, he always was - and we all held his hands and stayed with him until the end.'

Liam said: 'I’ll miss my dad. He was such a great motivator on the football field. He wasn’t one of those parents you hear about going mad on the football field.

'He also taught me to love a good pork pie.'

He added: 'My family all tell me that I’m exactly like my dad was. I’m never bothered, always happy to go with the flow.  As long as everybody else is happy, then I’m happy.'

Mr Wildsmith arrived late when his wife was in labour with Liam as he'd been watching a football match

Mrs Wildsmith said her husband, who co-founded the Hoyland Reds’ Barnsley FC supporters’ club, had two loves: family and football.

She added: 'He was a life-long Barnsley supporter - I remember being in labour and having to wait until he got back from a Barnsley match.'

Mr Wildsmith's mother, Sue, said: 'He had so many friends in the area - our living room looks like a florist with all the flowers and cards we’ve been sent.

'I’ll miss Mark every day, but Liam is so much like his father that his memory will live on through him.'

Mr Wildsmith's funeral will take place next week, and his family is planning to raise money to buy a defibrillator for the team's ground.
