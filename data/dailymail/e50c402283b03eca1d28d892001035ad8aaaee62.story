A man claims he was the victim of a brutal sex assault by Top of the Pops DJ Alan Freeman and his friend, Jimmy Savile, when he was just 11-years-old.

He also claims German film actor Victor Beaumont was the man who lured the schoolboy to his plush London flat where the rape allegedly took place.

Now nearly 50 years on, the anguished victim has reported the allegations to officers from Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree - the police investigation into the alleged sexual abuse by disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile.

Allegations: A man claims pals Jimmy Savile and Alan Freeman sexually attacked him when he was just 11

Alan 'Fluff' Freeman, who was known for his legendary catchphrases 'Greetings, Pop Pickers' and 'Not 'Arf' is the latest household name to come under the investigation's spotlight and raises further concerns that a paedophile ring operated within the BBC.

Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, the man claims Freeman and Savile 'showed me no pity and arrogantly thought they could get away with anything'.

Recalling the incident in 1964, the year that Savile and Freeman were founder presenters on the BBC's Top of the Pops, the man says he was approached by Beaumont while in the changing rooms at Granville Road swimming baths in Kilburn, north London.

He claims the German actor - whose real name was Peter Wolff and starred in hit films Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone - tried to usher the schoolboy away from the swimming baths after a fight broke out in the changing rooms.

The man, who has been married for 20 years, then claims Beaumont, who was wearing expensive clothes and gold-rimmed glasses, lead him to his Mercedes car outside and offered him sweets and cigarettes.

The Berlin-born actor said he wanted the boy to meet his wife and son, 'Klaus'.

The young boy asked to be taken to a bus stop, but Beaumont insisted on taking him back to his flat in Maida Vale, north west London.

DJ Freeman also had a flat in the same block.

After arriving at the flat, he claims the actor shut the French windows, drew the curtains and told the boy to dry himself, as he had not had time to do so at the swimming pool.

He then alleges that he was locked in the bedroom, while Beaumont summoned Freeman and Savile.

Before he had a chance to react, the man claims Beaumont ripped the towel from him and shoved him on to the bed.

The man, who has gone through years of therapy, claims: 'He went to force his hand on the back of my head and 
that’s when I saw two other men entering the room behind him. The first 
was wearing a dark suit and a tie. The other man behind him was wearing a
 tracksuit.'

He also alleges that he heard the name 'Fluff' being used during and after the brutal sexual attack, which left him unconscious.

When he awoke, the man says he heard his attackers arguing outside the bedroom and he took the opportunity to escape through a window.

Years later, the man said he recognised Freeman from his picture on the cover of the Radio Times magazine.

Under the spotlight: Alan Freeman revealed in later years that he was bisexual and is now at the centre of the latest claims reported to Operation Yewtree

The Australian-born DJ, who revealed was bisexual in a 1994 interview, died in 2006 aged 79.

Likewise, the victim recognised Beaumont decades later after seeing the 1958 comedy, The Square Peg on television. Beaumont died in 1977 aged 64.

Meanwhile, the man says he encountered Savile while driving past Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where the disgraced DJ was a fundraiser.

'I saw this figure jogging and my blood ran cold. I drove at him thinking I would kill him but couldn't bring myself to do it.'

He also claims to have shouted 'Maida Vale' at him repeatedly, before Savile disappeared into the hospital's grounds.

The Metropolitan Police confirmed it is aware of the new allegations.

Last month, it was reported a BBC compensation package worth £33,000 
could be handed to 120 victims of disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile.

The
 exact amount is expected to be finalised when high court judge Dame 
Janet Smith publishes the results of her inquiry, which is looking into 
the culture and practices at the BBC during the years of Savile’s abuse,
 later in the year.
