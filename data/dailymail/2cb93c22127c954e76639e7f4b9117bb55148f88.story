Sean Lamont's memories of Scotland’s last encounter with Tonga can give him sleepless nights as he recalls the 21-15 defeat that would cost Andy Robinson his job.

That cold day at Pittodrie two years ago was the low point in the 90-cap career of the Scotland utility back. So, on Saturday at Rugby Park, when he and his team-mates face-up to Tonga once again, Lamont is determined to bury some demons.

That sense of guilt remains, the depth of despair still felt. All Scotland could muster that day were five Greig Laidlaw penalties while Tonga scored two tries on their way to a famous victory.

For half an hour after the final whistle Robinson walked up and down the Pittodrie touchline deep in private conversion with SRU chief executive Mark Dodson. Later that evening he had resigned after accepting responsibility for the defeat, which had followed hammerings by New Zealand and South Africa.

‘That Tonga match two years holds bad memories for me,’ said Lamont. ‘I have had some bad losses but that was the most horrendous.

‘Not just because we didn’t want to give Tonga their first win over Scotland but because it cost a man his job — a man I got on well with and liked.

Lamont (right) puts in a fend on Sione Piukala but the Tongans would go on to claim victory in Aberdeen 

‘The buck stops somewhere, but it was the players on the day who didn’t turn up and that cost us the game.

‘What made that loss even worse was that we thought our mindset was right and we would beat them.

‘At the end of the game all the players went back to our clubs and that was it. We got the chance to rebuild at the Six Nations but our coach was gone.’

There is no danger that Scotland head coach Vern Cotter will suffer a similar fate if Scotland lose to Tonga. He has won four out of six games in charge and his team go into the match off the back of a fine win over Argentina and a fighting loss to world champions New Zealand.

But Lamont, who looks set to partner his Glasgow Warriors team-mate Alex Dunbar in the centre after Mark Bennett was ruled out with a hamstring injury, believes those two performances will count for little if Tonga are not beaten.

‘There have been times in the past when we have had a couple of good showings then have dropped off and that is not what we want to do this time,’ said the 33-year-old.

‘It is very important we don’t take a backwards step in terms of performance against Tonga after beating Argentina and then pushing the All Blacks close. For the good of Scottish rugby, we need to keep kicking on.

‘As a squad, the display against New Zealand especially helped our self-belief, which had always been a big issue in the past.

‘From playing around the world, I know Scottish players are harder on themselves than any other nation but we are getting better at accepting that errors happen and you have to dust yourself down and get on with it.

Lamont puts in a great tackle on New Zealand winger Julian Savea at Murrayfield last weekend 

‘We are at a point where we can realise our potential as we have a good, exciting side but we have to back up our performances — otherwise it is just talk again.

‘I think we can do that as we have got real depth in the squad that we have not had for a long time.

‘There is pride and passion in wearing the jersey and, under the new head coach, we have gone back to the drawing board and had a good look at ourselves and how we can improve.’

Lamont needs another 10 caps to join the elite band of international centurions but accepts it won’t be easy getting them in the run-up to the 2015 Rugby World Cup.

With Tommy Seymour and Sean Maitland first-choice wingers and Tim Visser and Dougie Fife also in contention, he knows it will be difficult to retain a place in the squad in his favoured position although his ability to play also in the centre — as he is likely to do against Tonga — gives him an extra string to his bow.

‘I will never declare myself available for Scotland, someone will do that for me,’ added the Scotland star.

‘I am not here to count caps, though. I am here to do whatever I can for Scotland. It would be a nice landmark to get to 100 caps and if I am playing well and get there, I deserve it. If someone is playing well and I don’t get there, so be it. It is whatever is best for Scotland.

‘I have gone from saying, “me first”, to making sure it is “Scotland first” That is why I will never say I will retire from international rugby. I will just become surplus to requirements.

‘If I am not used this weekend, that is fine. I will not be happy about it but if that is what the boss thinks is best for Scotland, then that is it.’
