It is one of the most famous lines in cinema history, but the legendary introduction, 'Bond... James Bond', might never have existed.

An early draft from 1952 of Ian Fleming's first Bond book, Casino Royale, reveals the author had originally intended his hero to call himself James Secretan when on undercover operations.

'Ian's first idea was to give James Bond an assumed name as his cover,' revealed his niece Kate Grimond, whose family owns the draft.

'Ian typed it up that way when he [Bond] first met Felix Leiter, the CIA agent, in the casino at the Hotel Splendide.'

In the typed manuscript the CIA operative introduces himself to 007 with the words: 'My name's Felix Leiter. Glad to meet you.'

He replies with the disappointingly long-winded: 'Mine's Secretan. James Secretan.'

But thankfully, Fleming later crossed out Secretan and handwrote the catchier 'Bond' above it, to make it simpler for his readers.

Grimond said: 'Ian must have realised it would cause confusion if he had Bond known as Bond to friends and the security services in London, but as Secretan for his cover name to strangers or people he didn't want to know he was a spy.'

The 'Bond... James Bond' line appeared a decade later in the first Bond film, Dr No.

The hero spy, then played by Sean Connery, uses it to introduce himself to one of the women he later seduces.

This draft extract from the novel was made public for the first time this weekend, to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the publication of Casino Royale.

Grimond believes that the name Secretan comes from the 19th Century Swiss philosopher, Charles Secrétan, who Fleming would have studied while at Eton College and when he went to universities in Germany and Switzerland.

'I've no proof but I do know Ian was interested in philosophy,' she said.

'He also often chose names from people he knew or had heard of — sometimes an amalgam of more than one person.'

Leiter came from an American friend 
called Marion Leiter. And James Bond itself is generally acknowledged to
 derive from the the American ornithologist of the same name, who was an
 expert on Caribbean birds.

Fleming who was a keen birdwatcher himself, was known to draw on his own encounters and interests in his work.

In the draft of Casino Royale, he initially called M's secretary in London 'Miss Pettavel' or 'Petty' for short.

The name and character were based on Kathleen Pettigrew, personal assistant to Stewart Menzies, the then director-general of MI6.

'But Ian again had second thoughts and changed it to Miss Moneypenny,'  Grimond said.

In another letter released to the public this weekend, Fleming complains to Jonathan Cape, the publisher of Casino Royale, that the suggested cover price is too low.

He said in October 1952: 'I am not in favour of reducing the price of the book to 10/6d.

'Hardly a novel is published today under 12/6d, and I think it would be a mistake for your first thriller to seem to be given away.'

He added: 'Moreover it [the lower price] would whittle down still further my already meagre financial expectations from the book.'

Fleming lost the battle: the price stayed at 10/6d.
