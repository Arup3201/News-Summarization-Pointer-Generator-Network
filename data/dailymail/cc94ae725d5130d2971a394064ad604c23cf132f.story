Lord Horatio Nelson was Rear-Admiral until he was shot and killed at the battle in 1805. Touted as one of England's greatest military triumphs new research shows 1,260 soldiers were foreign

Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar is thought of as one of Britain's greatest military achievements.

But new research by the National Maritime Museum and the National Archives has shown that the fighting was done by hundreds of foreigners, including some Frenchmen.

Of the 13,000 who served on the 33 ships to take part in the battle, 1,260 of them were born outside of Britain or Ireland.

They came from as far afield as Africa, India, America and another 20 European countries.

While most were from neutral or allied nations, 24 Spaniards and 54 Frenchmen also served in the 1805 fleet.

One was Pierre Lomac, 25, from Bordeaux, on HMS Conqueror, whose marines took the surrender of Vice Admiral Villeneuve, the leader of the French and Spanish fleet.

Benitte Grinzolo, 22, from Spain, sailed aboard HMS Mars which was heavily damaged in the battle.

Another name which stood out was Jane Townshend who served on the Defiance, and is the only woman proven to have been present, though witness accounts describe others being there.

She is listed as carrying out 'useful services', which were likely to have involved tending the wounded, cooking and washing.

Among the furthest from home were Zada 
Del Sulva, 31, from Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil, and Hampoo Hang, 34, born
in Guangzhou, China, on HMS Royal Sovereign, the flagship of Rear 
Admiral Collingwood, and the first vessel into action.

The enormous firefight included 33 British ships and roughly one in six of the Navy's serving personnel

Another was George Westphal, a 20-year-old of German origins, born in Nova Scotia, then a British colony. He was serving as a midshipman on HMS Victory, Nelson’s flagship, and after being wounded Nelson’s rolled up coat was used as a pillow under his head.

Westphal's blood bonded some of his hair to it. The surgeon had to cut the garment away to treat Westphal, who kept the fragments.

The research also found that around a quarter of the crew were inexperienced 'landsmen' with less than a year at sea.

Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph Bruno Pappalardo, naval expert at the National Archives, said: 'Not only was the fleet very cosmopolitan, it also wasn’t as highly skilled as is perceived.

'That has been part of the Nelson myth, that this was a crack fleet.'

Kiss me Hardy: Lord Nelson was hit by a French musket ball during the battle and later died from his wounds

As the world spiralled towards all-out conflict for the first time during the Napoleonic wars, a huge strain was placed up the British Navy trying to combat the might of Napoleon's fleet.

Around one in six of all the men employed by the Navy at the time took part in the battle, and around a seventh were from land-locked counties such as Warwickshire and Staffordshire.

The research is part of an ongoing project to extract information from various sources including muster lists, certificates of service and biographical works held in the National Archives.

The latest findings are to feature in the National Maritime Museum’s new Nelson, Navy, Nation gallery which opens on October 21, the 208th anniversary of the battle.

The data has also been used to create an ancestor tracker which people can use to find out if their ancient relatives served in the battle.

Britain lost no ships during the firefight, but 449 men were killed and 1,217 wounded. French and Spanish losses were 4,408 dead, 2,545 wounded and some 20,000 taken prisoner.

Gurkhas are known for their long curved combat knives, which serve as part of the Brigade's crest

Gurkhas - One of the oldest groups of foreigners to serve in the British army is also one of the only one still serving today. The Gurkha Brigade was formed after the defeat of Nepal in 1816 following two bloody campaigns by the British Army.

During the conflict a mutual respect developed between the soldiers, and British officers admired the Gurkhas for their fighting spirit, so allowed them to volunteer for the East India Company's Army.

The Brigade's numbers peaked during WWII at 112,00 and there are thought to be around 3,500 serving today in Afghanistan and elsewhere.

Sikhs - As World War One spread across Europe in 1914 colonial troops were called up in increasing numbers to serve the powers that ruled them. For Britain that meant drawing huge numbers from India.

Around 100,000 Sikhs volunteered to serve in the British Army despite making up just 2 per cent of the Indian population.

They were so fierce and well organised that by the end of the conflict English officers who served with them were wearing traditional turbans as a mark of admiration.

Irish - When the world went to war for a second time in 1939 most of the Irish mainland was no longer a part of the UK, and so its soldiers were not called up.

In fact Irish troops were told not to join British forces in the fight against Hitler and threatened with being labelled as deserters if they did.

Despite the threat which meant they were unable to work for the state for the rest of their lives, thousands suck away to join the European conflict. They were only recently granted a pardon by the Irish Government.

Americans - Another extended battle often called the finest in British history was the Battle of Britain, when RAF pilots successfully defended the UK mainland from Luftwaffe attacks as Hitler prepared to invade.

However, among the British pilots were several Americans who later formed the first Eagles Squadron in 1941, an American section of the RAF which initially flew defensive patrols.

As the war progressed, however, they were drafted into offensive operations and were joined by two further Eagles squadrons which became operational late in 1941.
