From balloon-popping lasers to Wolverine-style claws, there are numerous concept and protoype weapons designed by wannabe superhero inventors.

But, a magician has not only created a wristband that turns the wearer into Pyro from the Marvel comics, he is selling it for $174 (£111) online.

Named after the comic book mutant, the Pyro band features four chambers that fires four fireballs, and it can be controlled from the wrist or remotely.

Pyro (pictured) was designed by New Hampshire magician Adam Wilber. It features four separate chambers for four multiple shots and can be controlled either from the wrist or remotely

Its inventor, Adam Wilber explained: ‘Fire. Since the dawn of time it has been the reward at the end of man's quest. Both creator and destroyer, it has historically been the element hardest to control.

‘Until now. Your quest is over. The power of fire in the palm of your hand. That's the power of Pyro.'

It is available from the Ellusionist site, and ships internationally.

The band resembles a watch and can be concealed under a sleeve. 

Pressing a button on the device shoots the fireballs, or a remote control can be used to fire them from a distance of up to 30ft (nine metres) away.

The band resembles a watch and can be concealed under a sleeve (pictured left). It uses so-called Flash Cotton, or Flash Paper that fits inside the barrels. A heater coil then ignites the material when the button is pressed, forcing the flame to fire from the chambers

The device is named after Marvel comic book character Pyro, played by Adam Burton in the X-Men franchise (pictured). In the series, Pyro is a so-called Class 4 mutant that can create and control fire

If smartwatches from the likes of Apple and Motorola don't appeal to you, a German inventor has built a powerful alternative.

Dubbed Bond Inspired LaserWatch, the timepiece was designed at home by a hobbyist using a metal case, screws, and a built-in laser pointer.

The designer recently demonstrated the power of the laser by popping balloons and lighting matches from around 3ft (one metre) away.

It is the brainchild of Wuppertal-based Patrick Priebe.

It uses so-called Flash Cotton, or Flash Paper that fits inside the barrels. 

A heater coil then ignites the material when the button is pressed, forcing the flame to fire from the chambers.

The pack contains enough of this material for up to 50 uses. 

Refills then start at $8 (£4). 

Flash material is used by magicians to create fast burning flames for tricks.

Mr Wilber describes Pryo as a ‘badass professional device’, and as a result only over 18s are allowed to purchase or use the fire shooter.

The site ships internationally, but a disclaimer stresses that the device ‘contains dangerous elements’ that are governed by the laws of the country in which is it bought.

Buyers have to agree to the terms and conditions, and watch an instructional safety video by Adam Wilber, before buying the device.

It is recommended, and has been built for, magicians.

‘In the lead up to release we sent a number of Pyro units out to some of the most creative up-and-comers in the industry to put the unit through its paces,’ explained Ellusionist.

‘Every single person that received Pyrocalled us up and raved about it. Pyro has ignited an excitement within them.

Pressing a button on the device shoots the fireballs, or a remote control (pictured) can be used from up to 30ft (nine metres) away. It costs $174 (£111) and ships internationally.  Buyers have to agree to the terms and conditions, and watch a safety video before buying. It is recommended, and has been built for, magicians
