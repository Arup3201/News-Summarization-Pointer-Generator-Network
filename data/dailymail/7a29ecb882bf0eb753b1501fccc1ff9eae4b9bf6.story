A SUV complete with rooftop drone and a surface-to-air missile launcher are just two of the cutting edge weaponry on display at a South Korean arms fair this week.

Military and defence contractors from 30 countries descended on the country’s capital city to show off the latest technology at the Seoul International Aerospace and Defence Exhibition (ADEX).

Big names such as Boeing, Rolls-Royce and Lockheed Martin were among the exhibitors as South Korea made plans to upgrade their guidance-enhanced missiles and buy 60 fighter jets and major aircraft to bolster their defences against neighbouring North Korea.

During the six day exhibition 68 military officials and chief executives from 45 countries are expected to visit the show to strengthen their defence industries, according to Yonhap News.

A team of German pilots will discuss how a two engine, multi-role fighter operates while Boeing will show off their 737 Max Advanced Technology Winglet. Attack helicopters and aerial tankers will also be on display.

South Korea remains on alert after North Korea continues to fuel rhetoric that it is ready to launch operations against the country and the U.S.

Earlier this month a spokesman for the North's military warned the United States of ‘disastrous consequences’ for moving a group of ships, including an aircraft carrier, into a South Korean port.

Reclusive North Korea has often issued threats to attack the South and the United States but has rarely turned them into action. Such hostile rhetoric is widely seen as a means to perpetuate its domestic and international political agenda.

In March this year, the North declared it was no longer bound by the armistice that ended fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War signed with the United States and China, threatening to use nuclear weapons to attack U.S. and South Korean territories.

The North has defied international warnings not to build nuclear and long-range missiles and is believed to have enough fissile material to build up to 10 nuclear bombs.

The exhibition was established in 2005 in Seoul and in 2011 generated $9.97 billion worth of contracts.
