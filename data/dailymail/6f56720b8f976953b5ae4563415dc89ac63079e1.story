It wasn’t a good day for Manchester United’s Marouane Fellaini if he wanted to prove his new club manger Louis van Gaal wrong.

Or Vincent Kompany if he wanted bragging rights at Manchester City’s training ground next season over Pablo Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis and Sergio Aguero.

There were 10 Premier League players on show in Argentina's 1-0 win against Belgium in this World Cup quarter-final in Brasilia – eight for the losers. And it wasn’t their finest hour.

Poor: Belgium's Marouane Fellaini carried his Manchester United form into the match with Argentina

Frustrating: Fellaini could not find any form as Belgium were knocked out 1-0 by Argentina

Finish: Gonzalo Higuain put Argentina ahead on eight minutes with a superb turning shot

Poor: Belgium captain Vincent Kompany (left) struggled to deal with Argentina striker Higuain

Contest: Argentina's Higuain (right) troubled the Belgian defence, in particular Kompany

For Fellaini, he might as well have been wearing the red shirt of Manchester United.

Mercilessly
 criticised for his performances at Old Trafford and already seemingly 
written off by van Gaal, Fellaini was led a merry dance by Lionel Messi 
as he started in a holding midfield role.

The lame attempts to stop 
the little maestro in the build-up to Gonzalo Higuain’s eight-minute 
goal were as lethargic as The Stretford End would recall from last 
season.

In fact, his brightest moment came when he didn’t need to use
 his feet – stretching his 6ft4ins frame after an hour to head Jan 
Vertonghen’s cross over the bar.

And predictably, he was also accused
 of leaving his elbow where he shouldn’t when pushed further forward, 
this time into the back of the head of Argentina defender Ezequiel 
Garay. On other occasions, he was penalised for handball and offside.

But
 it would be unfair to single out Fellaini as the sole scapegoat as 
Belgium saved the biggest stage for their worst performance of the 
tournament.

All alone: Belgium's Eden Hazard controls the ball on his chest but he struggled and was substituted

Out of place: Tottenham's Jan Vertonghen (left) struggled at left back for Belgium

United: Fellaini (left) and Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta (right) struggled to get going

Low point: Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois lost his first match in 21 for Belgium

The normally-dependable Kompany was unreliable. He was 
wrongfooted by Higuain as the striker shot Argentina in front. Even more
 embarrassingly, Kompany was nutmegged by the same player in the second 
half as if in the school playground.

Jan Vertonghen looked largely 
what he was – a centre-back filling in on the left. Chelsea’s Eden 
Hazard didn’t live up to his billing and was replaced by Tottenham’s 
Nacer Chadli. Kevin Mirallas was hooked and replacement Romelu Lukaku 
couldn’t force an equaliser.

In goal, Chelsea’s Thibault Courtois tasted defeat for the first time in 21 matches for his country.On
 the flipside, Argentina’s English-based players enjoyed the day much 
better; Manchester City duo Zabaleta and Demichelis and team-mate 
Aguero, who watched from the bench.

Of course the Premier League 
Belgians will feel deflated today but at least they appeared in a World 
Cup quarter-final – unlike England.

Miss: Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku came on as a substitute for Belgium but squandered a great chance

Ineffective: Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli came on as a substitute but was largely anonymous

Off: Everton's Kevin Mirallas (left) was substituted after failing to impress for Belgium
