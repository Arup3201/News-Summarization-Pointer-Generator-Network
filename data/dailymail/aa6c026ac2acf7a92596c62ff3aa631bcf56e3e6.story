North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un said he is open to more talks with his South Korea counterpart.

In somewhat of a New Year's resolution, the leader said he is open to the discussions or even a summit - a statement welcomed by Seoul, the capital of South Korea, which in turn urged the North to take concrete steps towards normalisation of relations.

Kim's call for improving inter-Korea relations in his New Year speech comes as Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, faces heightened criticism over its human rights record.

There are also souring ties with Washington over allegations it was involved in the massive hacking attack on Sony Pictures linked to The Interview, a dark comedy that portrayed an assassination attempt on Kim.

North Korea has denied involvement, but said the hack was a 'righteous deed' and suggested it might have been carried out by sympathisers or supporters abroad.

'We believe we can resume suspended senior-level talks and hold other talks on specific issues if South Korea sincerely has a position that it wants to improve North-South relations through a dialogue,' Kim said in the nationally televised address.

'And there is no reason not to hold the highest-level talks if the atmosphere and conditions are met.'

Meeting such conditions has proven to be virtually impossible in the past.

The two countries have not held a summit since 2007 and, despite Kim's remarks, the likelihood of one happening again soon is very low given the deep distrust that remains between the two countries.

Some experts in the South, however, cautiously welcomed the possibility of increased talks at lower levels.

'Animosities between South and North Korea would deepen... if they fail to improve their political ties and ease military tension through a summit this year,' said Cheong Seong-chang from the private think-tank Sejong Institute.

South Korean officials say they are open to any form of talks.

Seoul is waiting for the North to respond to its earlier proposal to hold talks this month to discuss a range of issues needed to prepare for the unification and other issues of mutual concern. South Korea made the proposal earlier this week.

'If North Korea truly has a will to improve South-North relations through a dialogue, we hope (the North) quickly respond positively to our proposal for talks,' the South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement.

Kim noted that this year is particularly significant because it marks the 70th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule.

Both sides claim to hold reunification as a fundamental goal, but a vast gap remains over how that should be accomplished and under what form of government a unified Korea would be administered.

On domestic policy, Kim indicated he will stick to the country's longstanding 'Military First' policy and suggested he would pursue science, technology and economic policies aimed at improving the impoverished nation's standard of living.

But he also fell back to familiar accusations that the South and the United States are to blame for tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

Kim said South Korea must abandon all plots to launch wars and try to work toward fostering peace, and that Washington must initiate a policy shift by abandoning its 'hostile policy' and 'reckless invasion plots' on the North.

The 30-minute speech was the third Kim has delivered on New Year's Day, and the first after the end of the traditional three-year mourning of the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in late 2011.

Some analysts believe that with the mourning period over, Kim will pursue policies that more closely reflect his own personal priorities.

A South Korean activist said he will launch balloons carrying DVDs of Sony's The Interview toward North Korea to try to break down a personality cult built around dictator Kim Jong-un.

The comedy depicting an assassination attempt on Kim is at the centre of tension between North Korea and the U.S., with Washington blaming Pyongyang for crippling hacking attacks on Sony Entertainment.

Yesterday, activist Park Sang-hak said he will start dropping 100,000 DVDs and USB sticks with the movie by balloon in North Korea as early as late-January.

Park, a North Korean defector, said he's partnering with the U.S.-based non-profit Human Rights Foundation, which is financing the making of the DVDs and memory sticks of the movie with Korean subtitles.

Park said foundation officials plan to visit South Korea around January 20 to hand over the DVDs and USBs, and that he and the officials will then try to float the first batch of the balloons if weather conditions allow.

'North Korea's absolute leadership will crumble if the idolisation of leader Kim breaks down,' Park said.

If carried out, the move is expected to enrage North Korea, which expressed anger over the movie. 

In October, the country opened fire at giant balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets floated across the border by South Korean activists, triggering an exchange of gunfire with South Korean troops.

But it is not clear how effective the plan will be, as only a small number of ordinary North Korean citizens are believed to own computers or DVD players. 

Owning a computer requires permission from the government and costs as much as three months' salary for the average worker, according to South Korean analysts.

Many North Koreans may not risk watching the movie for fear of being caught. 

Not everyone supports sending balloons into the North, with liberals and border town residents in South Korea urging the activists to stop. 

North Korea has long demanded that South Korea stop the activists, but Seoul refuses, citing freedom of speech.

Park said the balloon release will be done clandestinely, with the pace picking up in March when he expects the wind direction to become more favorable.

Calls to the Human Rights Foundation on Wednesday were not immediately answered. 

The foundation says on its website that it works with North Korean defectors to use hydrogen balloons to send material across the border, as well as smuggling items through China and broadcasting radio transmissions to reach those who own illegal short wave radios.
