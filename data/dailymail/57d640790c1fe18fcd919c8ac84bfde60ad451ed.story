West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is interested in taking Manchester United duo Wilfried Zaha and Ashley Young on loan.

Allardyce officially welcomed new £12million arrival Enner Valencia from Pachuca on Thursday and is keen to further strengthen his attacking options.

Zaha was Sir Alex Ferguson's last signing before he retired in 2013 but rarely featured under former United boss David Moyes and spent the second half of last season on loan at Cardiff.

On the list: Man United's Wilfried Zaha is also attracting West Ham's attention

On the move? Ashley Young faces an uncertain under new United manager Louis van Gaal

Target: West Ham have made a move to sign Emanuel Insua (right) on loan from Boca Juniors

Siblings: Emanuel Insua's brother, Emilano (middle), had a spell with Liverpool

Young endured a difficult season for 
United, scoring just twice in 20 Premier League games under Moyes.

The pair will be hoping to impress new boss Louis van Gaal and Allardyce is keeping an eye on developments should the Dutchman decide to offload either player.

Allardyce has also made a bid to take Boca Juniors left-back Emanuel Insua on loan. The 23-year-old is the younger brother of former Liverpool defender Emiliano and is valued at around £4million.

West Ham had asked about Dnipro's Croatia left-back Ivan Strinic but that has fallen through and Boca may yet reject a loan offer for Insua preferring a permanent sale.

Allardyce wants Stuttgart defender Antonio Rudiger and another midfielder. They have been offered Saphir Taider, 22, from Inter Milan.
