A bungling thief was caught stealing from a bandit after being forced to take off his makeshift disguise of a binbag because he couldn't see what he was doing. 

Daniel Dzieliski, 38, had been trying to rob the one-armed bandit in Biala Podlaska, a city in the eastern Poland, when he spotted CCTV cameras in the room.

Nipping out, he went to a nearby shop where he bought bin liners to hide his head and aluminium foil to put over the cameras.

The burglar walked into the room where he spotted the one-armed bandit and the security cameras which prompted him to go to a nearby shop to buy a disguise 

He then returned with a makeshift disguise of a balaclava made out of binbags, but then had trouble being able to see what he was doing 

But after realising he would not be able to cover the cameras with foil with his head covered he took the bag off and tried putting foil over the camera lenses - and was filmed in the process.

When the foil kept falling off, he tried hiding his face in his hands.

Police spokesman Jaroslaw Janicki said: 'It was all quite comical, really.

'He first went into the room with nothing on his head and inspected the slot machines.

'He then left and returned with the bin liner over his head and tried covering the cameras up.

He then decides to take off the binbag, revealing himself to the CCTV cameras, allowing police to establish his identity 

In a bid to try and hide himself, he covers his face with his hands but it is too late as police were able to identify him as 38-year-old Daniel Dzieliski

'But when the foil kept falling off because he couldn't see what he was doing, he took the bag off his head and tried covering his face with his hands.

'It was like watching a comedy.

'But we identified him immediately because he is well-known to us.

'In November he was arrested for stealing £2,000 from another fruit machine.'

The man was arrested again, and is now facing two years in jail.
