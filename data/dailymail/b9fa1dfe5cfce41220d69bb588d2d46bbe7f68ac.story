Andy Murray and Heather Watson rounded off their week at the Hopman Cup with victory - but Great Britain still failed to progress to the final in Perth.

Poland's victory against France earlier on Friday had guaranteed top spot in Group B, meaning that Britain's evening clash with Australia was nothing more than a "friendly".

Murray and Watson both picked up victories in their respective singles matches and the pair then teamed up in the doubles to seal a 3-0 win against the hosts.

Although the Hopman Cup is not an official tour event, it takes nothing away from Watson's performance against world No 29 Casey Dellacqua as the 22-year-old Brit won 6-3, 6-4.

Murray then continued his strong start to the year, beating Marinko Matosevic 6-3, 6-2 to pick up his fifth win in five singles matches so far this year.

The two Brits then paired up to beat Dellacqua and Matosevic 7-5, 6-1 in an entertaining doubles match.

Murray now flies to Melbourne to prepare for the Australian Open, which begins on January 19, while Watson heads to Tasmania for the WTA Hobart International.

The Polish pairing of Jerzy Janowicz and Agnieszka Radwanska will take on USA's John Isner and Serena Williams in the Hopman Cup finalon Saturday.
