Today host Matt Lauer has opened up about how he first discovered his co-host Savannah Guthrie, 42, was pregnant, and reveals some of the sneaky tactics he employed to help her conceal it during team nights out at Russia's Sochi Winter Olympics.

During a joint appearance on Tuesday's Late Night With Seth Meyers, he explained that during rowdy staff dinners, Ms Guthrie would sometimes 'hand [him] a shot' so she could mask the fact that she was skipping alcohol.

'So Savannah owes me a liver right now,' he joked.

It also came to light that Mr Lauer realized she was pregnant when he noticed her 'faking' shots during a previous drinking game one night.

A restaurant employee was apparently teaching guests how to take shots 'military-style' off their elbows, when he realized Ms Guthrie wasn't actually swallowing the alcohol.

He says 'a light bulb went on' when he returned to his hotel room later that night, after which he promptly sent his co-host a text.

'I texted her, "Are you pregnant?" And I got this very curt message back. Like, "Yes. Shut up. Don’t tell anyone”', he told Mr Meyers.

Ms Guthrie, who is now five months pregnant, but didn't go public with the news until after she returned from Russia, laughed and clarified that her actual response was different.

'What I said was, "How can you ask me that when [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is listening to us!”' she exclaimed.

Today's Natalie Morales says she also noticed that Ms Guthrie had started shying away from alcohol during the Sochi trip, admitting: 'Some of us had caught on.'

Ms Guthrie concluded by saying that she appreciated her female colleague's discretion.

'Here’s the difference between you [to Ms Morales], and you, [to Mr Lauer]... Natalie suspected but did not ask,' she said. 'Matt went all "Matt Lauer" on me!'

How can you ask me that when Putin is listening to us!

Ms Guthrie returned to the Today show on Monday after her week-long 'honey-babymoon'.

The glamorous host, who married communications consultant Michael Feldman, 45, on March 15, even found time to blog while she was off work, telling fans how 'glorious' her 'pregnancy beach vacation' was.

In an April 23 post titled 'Letting it all hang out on the best vacation of my life', she continued: 'Vacationing while pregnant is an excellent excuse to let it all hang out and not worry about how you look in a bathing suit.

'Before I left, I vowed: I am going to let it all hang out. I’m wearing a roomy one-piece with the stretchiest material mankind has invented.

'I am exhaling. Whilst relaxing seaside in the evening, I am going to wear a caftan or a muumuu or a perhaps a tent.

'I am going to eat what I want. I am going to drink what I want (hello, chocolate milkshake! calcium for baby’s growing bones!). 

'I am just going to enjoy the miracle that is pregnancy and be thankful every minute for good fortune, and good guacamole.'

Reunited: The expectant mother's colleagues seemed overjoyed to have her back 'home'

Paradise: Ms Guthrie posted this Instagram shot while she was away on her 'honey-babymoon'

The expectant mother also posted a couple of photographs to Instagram, with one showing her manicured foot in front of a beach backdrop. The location was not mentioned.

'Gone fishin. And by "fishin" I mean lounging on the beach #honeybabymoon See you next wk,' she wrote.

Ms Guthrie's colleagues certainly 
appeared to have missed her. Matt Lauer excitedly tweeted a pictrure of 
her in the TV studio this morning captioned 'She's back!' and the Today 
Show twitter feed also welcomed her 'home'.

'I am going to eat what I want. I am 
going to drink what I want. I am just going to enjoy the miracle that is pregnancy'

One of her first tasks back was to talk about her changing body in light of new research showing that women spend an average of 50 minutes daily in front of their own reflections.

As she looked at herself in a mirror, Ms Guthrie said: 'I love my baby bump. I love the fact that I'm 42 years old and lucky enough to get this chance, and the human body is remarkable.

'I'm divinely inspired, i think, to be able to create life. so right now, I'm just loving that my body is able to do this and produce life.'

The broadcaster admitted in her baby blog earlier this month that she feared she would never become a mother.

She and Mr Felman  are expecting their first child together this August and they are choosing not to find out the sex before.

The couple tied the knot outside Ms Guthrie's home town of Tucson, Arizona, last month without publicizing the event to media.

During the course of the evening the newlyweds privately announced to family and friends that they were expecting a child.

Ms Guthrie later went public with her 'surprise' wedding and pregnancy news on the Today show.

'I love the fact 
that I'm 42 years old and lucky enough to get this chance, and the human
 body is remarkable'

She said that she'd already bought her Monique Lhuillier A-line belted 
wedding gown when she found out she was pregnant in 
December last year.

Luckily, despite her worst fears, the gown still fitted on her big day.

Ms Guthrie added that it had been tough to keep her wedding and pregnancy a secret especially with her high public profile.

'I am so happy to tell the world because I can't suck in this gut anymore,' she joked.

The mother-to-be will continue to keep fans up-to-date about her pregnancy via her Today show blog.

Big news: Ms Guthrie announced that she was expecting her first child at her 'surprise' wedding in March

So far she says some of the best things about being pregnant is the support she's received from fans, friends and family and being able to wear stretchy maternity jeans.

She met her new husband, Mr Feldman, in 2008 when she went to his 40th birthday party with a mutual friend.

They began dating a few months later and got engaged last May during a trip to the Turks and Caicos Islands.

Mr
 Feldman was a former aide to Al Gore, and heads up a successful 
communications advisory firm based in Washington D.C. and New York.

It
 is a second marriage for Ms Guthrie who was previously married to 
English-born BBC News presenter Mark Orchard. The two divorced in 2009.
