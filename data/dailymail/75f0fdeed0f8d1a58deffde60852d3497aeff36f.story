Tributes have been paid to Sergeant Louise Lucas who has died after a collision with a bus in Swansea

A policewoman sacrificed her life in front of a bus to save her eight-year-old daughter on a 'lethal' city centre road. 

Tributes have poured in for Cardiff police officer Sergeant Louise Lucas, 41, who died after sustaining serious injuries in the collision on the Kingsway in Swansea yesterday.

Her eight-year-old daughter, Olivia, suffered minor injuries following the crash with the X11 bus at 11.25am.

She was off-duty when she took Olivia to the shops as a treat together.

Onlookers have said the pair were crossing the road and were inches from a bus - but Sgt Lucas pushed her daughter to safety and took the full impact of the collision. 

The mother-of-three was rushed to the city's Morriston hospital where doctors battled to save her but she later died.

Her son Grant, 21,said: 'Mum was the best there is and was simply amazing. 

'Olivia is fine and only suffered minor injuries, but mum passed away later this afternoon.

'I am absolutely well and truly gutted.' 

The officer also has a younger child called Lloyd - an aspiring footballer who is in Swansea city's development squad.

She lived with her husband Gavin, 36, at the family home in Llanishen, Cardiff.

Grant said that he wanted to make his mother 'proud' and would help to raise Olive and Lloyd.

He added: 'It's mad how my mum and I became much closer over the last couple of weeks and had it all planned out.

'On behalf of the family, we would like to thank all friends for their support.' 

South Wales Police assistant chief constable Jon Stratford posted on Twitter: 'Tonight our thoughts are with the family of Louise Lucas.

'A superb officer, committed to her community with a great sense of fun. So sad.'

Deputy chief constable Matt Jukes wrote: 'Awful day for South Wales Police and above all, for the family of PS Louise Lucas. My heartfelt condolences. A great cop - we will truly miss her.'

And assistant chief constable of territorial policing Richard Lewis added: 'Incredibly sad day for all officers at South Wales Police after the tragic death of Sgt Louise Lucas. 

'My sincere condolences are with her family tonight.'

Sgt Lucas, who most recently served in the Llanishen area of Cardiff, was well known in the community

Sgt Lucas, who most recently served in the Llanishen area of Cardiff, was well known in the community.

Cardiff City councillor Jayne Cowan paid tribute to Louise posting: 'Louise was an inspirational, hard working and terrific person. (I'm) proud to have known and spent time with her.'

Community website My Whitchurch posted: 'Very sad to hear of the tragic death of PS Louise Lucas. Based in Llanishen, she was one in a million. A bright star in a dark sky.'

As news of her sad death spread tributes to Sgt Lucas were posted by police and emergency services across the UK using the hashtag #999family.

Surrey Roads Police posted: 'Our thoughts are with the family, friends & colleagues of Sgt Louise Lucas of South Wales Police.'

And officers from the Met Police in Barking and Dagenham wrote: 'Thoughts are with the friends, family and colleagues of Sergeant Louise Lucas at this very sad time.'  

A spokesman for the South Wales Police Federation, which represents officers in the force, described the news as devastating.

He said: 'Louise brightened any room she walked into and her tragic passing at such a young age will leave a huge gap within South Wales Police, her friends who loved her, but most importantly for her family, who have lost a devoted mother and wife.

South Wales Police confirmed it was continuing to investigate the cause of the tragic incident and appealed for witnesses

'Words at this painful time can provide little consolation, but as part of her police family we share the sense of grief and loss at her passing and hope to help her children, husband, family and friends come to terms with their loss.'

South Wales Police confirmed it was continuing to investigate the cause of the tragic incident and appealed for witnesses.

Inspector Steve Davies said: 'Our thoughts are with the family at this very sad time and they are being supported by specially trained officers.

'I would also like to pay tribute to the efforts of the emergency services at the scene in very difficult circumstances.'

The Kingsway has long been branded a death-trap by many local residents.

In 2006 the road was changed from a standard dual carriageway to a two-way bus lane on one side and a one-way system for cars on the other.

There have been a number of accidents on the city centre road in recent years - including the death of 37-year-old Gower man Daniel Foss, who died after being hit by a National Express coach.

Emergency services were called to Kingsway in Swansea following the crash between the two pedestrians and the X11 bus at about 11.25am

Although markings on the pavement tell pedestrians which way to look, many shoppers and workers label the 'continental Kingsway' as confusing.

Several residents took to Twitter following news of Mrs Lucas's death calling on Swansea Council to change the road back to how it used to be.

Chris Stephens wrote: 'When will the council learn that the road layout is dangerous?'

And Kate Jenkins added: 'That bus lane set up is completely lethal and needs to change.' 

A young woman died last night and three children were injured after a bus and a car collided in south west London.

The woman, who was a pedestrian in her twenties, was critically injured and died at the scene, police said.

A car containing two adults and three children was also involved in the crash, which took place at around 9pm on Penrhyn Road, Kingston upon Thames.

They were injured and are being treated at the scene, while the bus driver received minor injuries.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said no arrests have been made.
