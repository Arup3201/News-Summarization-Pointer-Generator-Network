Jose Mourinho has apologised to Chelsea fans for criticising the lack of atmosphere at Stamford Bridge.

The Portuguese launched a stinging attack on his own fans by claiming home games felt like they were ‘playing in an empty stadium’ after they laboured to a 2-1 victory against Queens Park Rangers three weeks ago.

Fans were unhappy with the comments and it prompted the Chelsea Supporters Trust to call for safe standing areas at the ground to improve the atmosphere.

But all four corners of Chelsea’s ground were in full voice as they tore West Bromwich Albion to pieces.

‘It improved a lot,’ Mourinho said. ‘There is no comparison. I don’t want to speak again about it, for good and bad. They pay me to win matches, to coach, not to be critical of the crowd. I feel sorry with my comments from a couple of weeks ago. The difference was amazing.’

They had plenty to cheer, particularly in the first half, as Chelsea played some of their best football of the season to sweep West Brom aside. But Mourinho has warned his current crop of players that they must win titles before they are considered a top side.

‘I cannot compare teams that have won everything with teams that have won nothing,’ Mourinho added. ‘This team has won nothing. This is a new team. The other Chelsea team finished a couple of years ago.

‘These guys they have to win if they want to be seen as a great team. It’s not just about playing beautiful football. They have to win titles. When they win titles we will compare them.’

West Brom boss Alan Irvine had no complaints about the straight red card shown to Claudio Yacob for jumping in on Diego Costa.

‘It was understandable,’ Irvine said. ‘The rules state if you leave the ground it can be interpreted that you’re not I control of your body and endanger an opponent. I’ve watched it back and I understand the decision.’

But he added: ‘I’ve watched first goal back and I thought it was offside. It was a great chest and finish but I’m not going to blame our players for an incorrect decision.’
