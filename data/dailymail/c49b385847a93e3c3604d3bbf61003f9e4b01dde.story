Hayley Crews' most cherished Christmas present came two days late. 

The Oregon woman lost her cat more than a week ago after her boyfriend sold her box spring on Craigslist, without realizing her kitty named Camo was hiding inside. 

After a massive search involving hundreds of tips, Camo was located this weekend and is finally back home with Crews and her boyfriend Roy Dufek. 

Christmas miracle! Camo the cat has returned home ten days after he was taken from the apartment hidden inside a box spring that its owner's boyfriend sold on Craigslist 

Back home: The Tabby cat was caught using a live trap and when its owners found him, he was two pounds lighter with a squinty eye, bleeding paws and several broken nails

The Tabby cat originally went missing on December 17 when Dufek decided to surprise his girlfriend by selling her extra mattresses on Craigslist, ahead of moving in together.

What he didn't realize at the time though, was that her cat liked to hide in the box spring. 

Dufek noticed Camo was missing shortly after seeing the box spring off to its new owner, who took it more than six miles down the road to an area near the Hillsboro Airport outside Portland, Oregon. 

The couple searched the home of the person who bought the box spring to no avail - Camo wasn't there. 

Distance: The cat was located near the Hillsboro Airport, which is about six miles from the apartment building where Crews lived with the cat

From there, the couple started a massive canvassing campaign, covering their town in missing cat posters and searching for the feline on foot. 

Unfortunately, the couple had to leave town shortly after Camo went missing to spend the holidays back home in Arizona. 

But when they came back on Saturday they got a pleasant surprise. 

A tipster called Dufek after spotting a cat that looked like Camo near the Hillsboro Airport. 

On Saturday, the couple set up a live trap which included sardines and clothing from Crews' home. 

Beloved: The couple received hundreds of calls with possible spottings of Camo during the 10 days the cat was missing 

After just an hour and a half, Crews and a friend returned to the trap and found Camo inside - albeit a little worse for wear. 

In a message on Facebook, Dufek writes that Camo was scared and hissing when they found the cat in the crate. 

Back home, they noticed Camo was about two pounds lighter and had a cut lip, several broken nails, bleeding paws and a squinty eye.  

'He spent the night getting up several times eating and drinking and was taken to the vet this morning,' Dufek wrote. 'The vet gave him an antibiotic shot, a good inspection, and he was off back to home where we think we pulled a tick off and are treating him for fleas.

'Hayley gave him a bath and he's been cleaning himself vigorously since.'

The couple go on to thank everyone who volunteered their time to aid in the search for Camo, especially during the holidays. 

'It was quite emotional last night, we're in shock of this whole experience, and have been holding him tight!' Dufek wrote.
