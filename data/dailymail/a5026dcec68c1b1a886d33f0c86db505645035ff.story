It’s not every day you see a real-life street fight over a piece of artwork broken up by an Oscar-nominated actor.

But that’s exactly what happened in the middle of a road in Manhattan, New York, when Ryan Gosling stepped in to separate a scuffle.

The 30-year-old star of Crazy, Stupid, Love was on hand in the East Village to separate the two men and calm down an escalating situation.

The video, filmed by a pedestrian before the actor appears on the scene, went viral on Monday after it was uploaded last weekend.

A number of people try to tear the men apart before Gosling walks towards the altercation and bystanders recognise him, reported E! Online.

The actor was seen to physically restrain one of the men in the fight after dropping his grocery bag, reported the New York Daily News.

He takes the pair away from traffic at the intersection while female fans realise he is ‘the guy from The Notebook,’ as one described him.

Film shoot: Gosling is currently in New York for the making of 'The Place Beyond The Pines', due to be released in 2013

Gosling is wearing a baseball hat, shorts and a striped tank top in the video - but the exact date of the fight is still unknown.

He is currently filming ‘The Place Beyond The Pines’ in upstate New York, which is due to be released in 2013.

It’s a turnaround for the actor, said to have been taken out of primary school as a child and taught at home because of bullying.

Gosling’s representative has not yet commented on the incident.
