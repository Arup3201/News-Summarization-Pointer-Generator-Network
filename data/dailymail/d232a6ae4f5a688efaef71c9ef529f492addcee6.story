Extraordinary: Alan Whitwell, pictured leaving the Dale Cregan trial, told how the killer arrived at his house and demanded a haircut and a bath

A barber has today told how after five weeks on the run, serial killer Dale Cregan arrived at his home demanding a haircut saying: 'I want to look good in court'.

Alan Whitwell, 34, was held captive with his girlfriend and her daughter in their Manchester house, while the one-eyed gangster plotted to murder the police.

On his 'last night of freedom' before gunning down PCs Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, Cregan celebrated with 'beer and cigars' and placed a grenade on
the mantlepiece and his gun on the arm of the sofa.

Cregan then demanded a haircut before he started his killing spree, but Mr Whitwell feared he might be killed because he didn't have his cutting equipment with him.

'He was asking for a "chop" but my clippers were in my shop. I thought I was going to die because I didn't have my clippers,' he told The Sun.

After using scissors to trim Cregan's hair and beard in the back garden, he then ran Cregan a bath.

The next morning, September 18 2012, Cregan called 999 from Alan's bedroom to report a hoax burglary at the home in Hattersley, Greater Manchester, telling a call handler a concrete slab had been thrown through a window.

He calmly ended the five-minute conversation by saying: 'I'll be waiting', before shooting the police officers more than 30 times when they arrived, before throwing a grenade at them while they lay dying on the lawn.

Attack: Dale Cregan had forced his way into Alan Whitwell's home (pictured) and late gunned down the police outside

Mr Whitwell said when it happened it was like 'a scene from The Terminator'.

'I saw the gun in his hand and he mumbled something about the police. I heard the front door open and then just heard ‘Bam!’ he told The Sun.

'The shots seemed to go on for ever. Then I saw him pull the pin out of the grenade and throw it back towards the house.

'I thought the house was going to fall to bits because the boom was just incredible.

‘I can still hear the noise of the gun 
being fired. I then heard a massive explosion. It shook the house. I 
immediately thought it was the grenade he had brought with him.’

Home: Forensic officers last September at the scene close to where police constables Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, where shot dead by Dale Cregan in Hattersley, Greater Manchester

Cregan then dumped his glock handgun beside the bodies before handing himself at the local police station and said: 'I’ve murdered two police officers'.

A day earlier Cregan had arrived at Mr Whitwell's and then forced his way in through the back door.

‘I was really scared. I was immediately horrified and feared for my life. Dale Cregan was the last person I expected to be at my home,' he told Preston Crown Court.

‘I knew Dale Cregan was wanted by the police for murders. He just walked in and said, ‘Get in.’ He said to me, "Do as I say" and basically saying if you don’t you will get hurt.’

Mr Whitwell then went upstairs to tell his girlfriend what was happening and she was ‘absolutely petrified’ and only knew Cregan from what she had seen on the TV.

Killings: Cregan shot Pc Nicola Hughes (left) 
eight times, including three strikes to the head as she lay on the 
ground. Pc Fiona Bone (right) was hit up to eight times after she 
managed to draw and fire her Taser

Scene: Cregan discharged 32 bullets in total in barely half a minute. He then left his 'calling card' of a military grenade which he threw it onto the path where the two officers lay

Mr Whitwell told the court: ‘Dale then pulled out a grenade then placed that on the fireplace. I was terrified. If someone has got a gun and a grenade I will do whatever they want.’

‘Throughout this incident we were in shock and fear, I honestly believed one of us would be killed if we had not done as we were told.

‘Cregan had a gun and grenade while at my house. I was just going to do whatever he said or told me to do so he would go away as soon as possible.’ He said Cregan made a number of phone calls in an attempt to get some cocaine and then sent out for beer, cigarettes and two big cigars.

Mr Whitwell, who said Cregan was looking at a laptop, said: ‘Cregan spoke about the incidents he had already been involved in, about how he had done it,’ said Mr Whitwell.

Towards dawn Cregan then took a bath in at the house and asked the hairdresser to cut his hair before putting on a set of clean clothes.

Around 5.30am the next morning Mr Whitwell went to work, to keep the appearance of normality, but he came back home as he was worrying about his family.

By now Cregan had finalised his plan and phoned up the police reporting a spurious burglary to lay a trap for officers.
