Mitt Romney will decide whether to compete for the Republican presidential nomination within the next weeks. 

Talk show host Larry King says Romney made the disclosure during a chance encounter the two had at the airport over the weekend.

With Romney seriously considering another go at the presidency, GOP presidential hopefuls are ratcheting up their attacks on the 2012 nominee's last campaign, aiming to blast enough holes in the former Massachusetts governor's possible bid to sink it before it sets ashore. 

But Romney's close friends and backers say his faith may be driving him to run again anyway.

Hi, it's me again: 2012 Republican presidential nominee  Mitt Romney is thinking about running again in 2016 to the chagrin of his party's other potential candidates

Talk show host Larry King, center, says he ran into Mitt and wife Ann at the airport at Mitt told him he'll be making a final decision on 2016 within the next two weeks

At a forum on Sunday night in California hosted by a conservative non-profit, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul invoked Romney's wife, who insisted last year that her husband wouldn't run for president again, and said: 'I’m kind of with Ann Romney on this one: "No, no, no, no, never.” ' 

Speaking at the same forum Texas Sen. Ted Cruz blamed Romney's infamous '47 percent' comment and the rationale behind it for the GOP's loss in 2012. 

'I think Mitt is a good and decent and honorable man, and I think he ran a very hard campaign,' Cruz began. 'But the central narrative of the last election, what the voters heard, was "we don't have to worry about the 47 percent."

'And I think that Republicans are and should be the party of the 47 percent,' he argued.

Romney - along with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush - has become a pinata for Republicans considering presidential campaigns in recent days as they angle to present themselves as the GOP's best foot forward heading in the 2016 general election. 

After Bush and Romney met for a private, face-to-face chat on Thursday in Utah, Paul trolled the two so-called establishment candidates on Twitter with memes of friendship bracelets and charms.

'Dear Mitt, 3rd time's a charm,' a photo featuring a silver bracelet with a note attached read, along with Bush's signature.

Earlier this month, after news of Romney's interest in the 2016 contest broke, Paul said the GOP needed 'a new approach, a fresh approach.'

Sunday at the Freedom Partners gathering in Palm Springs Paul said of Romney, 'I think he's a good man, he's a generous man, and he would have been a great president. He would have been much better than this president.

'But to win the presidency,' he said, 'you have to reach out and appeal to new constituencies, and I just don't think it's possible [for Romney to do that.]

'If he thinks well, I'm just going to change a few themes, and next time, I'll reach out to more people than that... I think it's a little more visceral than that, how you connect with people,' he continued.

Paul said he's 'just not sure' Romney would be able to make that kind of connection 'with enough people to win a general election.'

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul trolled Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Thursday after it was announced that the two so-called establishment candidate would meet privately. Asked Sunday if Romney should run again, Paul said: 'No, no, no, no, never'

Dark horse GOP candidates Donald Trump and Sarah Palin also derided a Romney revival tour over the weekend.

Trump told reporters in Iowa on Saturday for conservative Congressman Steve King's Freedom Summit, 'Mitt had his chance. ... And he choked.' 

'You don't want to give a person like that a second chance. ... they'll absolutely lose to the Democrats,' Trump added, referring to both Romney and Bush, a first-time presidential candidate himself but the third person in his immediate family to pursue the Oval Office.

'I just don't think they can win,' he said.

Trump argued that America's had 'enough of the Bushes.'

'We're bushed out.'

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was none-to-thrilled about the prospect of either Romney or Bush carrying the GOP's torch in 2016 when asked about them on Friday by ABC News.

'I can’t wait for new energy,' the 2008 vice presidential nominee-turned reality TV star said, joking.

Palin said she'd be 'interested' in running for president next year but stressed that she doesn't necessarily need to be a candidate. 

Most importantly, she said, is that the Republican primary 'be a competition and not a coronation.'

'I think he's a good man, he's a generous man, and he would have been a great president,' Paul said Sunday night during a forum at a Freedom Partners meeting in Palm Springs, California, that was aired in part by ABC News. 'But to win the presidency,' he said, 'you have to reach out and appeal to new constituencies, and I just don't think it's possible [for Romney to do that.]'

If Romney does run, his Morman faith will be contributing factor, allies say.

His contemplation of a third presidential campaign comes from an 'almost devout belief that he needs to do something for this country,' Kirk Jowers, a fellow Mormon and the former chair or Romney's political action committee told the New York Times. 

'In the Mormon faith, public service is one of the most honorable things you do — to participate in local and national politics is a very honorable thing to do,' said Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Romney advocate who the Times says has spoken recently with the Republican politician.

'The idea of try and try again is something that’s ingrained in the religion,' as well, he noted.

Jowers said another attempt at higher office would also give Romney a platform to testify about his faith - something he didn't do in previous campaigns.

'In 2008, Romney risked being a caricature of the Mormon candidate,' he said. 'Now everyone seems to know everything about him, and that will be very liberating for him to talk about his faith.'

Should Romney make it his mission to win the GOP nomination again in 2016, early polling shows he'd be well positioned.

Nearly a third of Republican voters and right leaning independents in first in the nation state New Hampshire say they'd vote for Romney again if the primary were held now.

Romney also tops Iowa voters' lists. He lead his closest potential rival, Bush, by seven points in a recent Gravis Marketing poll.

A Bloomberg survey released in December showed that Romney couldn't beat Hillary Clinton in a general election match-up if she were to also run and win her party's nomination, but he, Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie would have the best odds.

The three Republicans would lose to Clinton by six points, the poll found. Paul would take an eight-point lashing, and Cruz would face a double-digit whooping of 13 percentage points.
