Adam Smith seems to have become the latest footballer to have acquired a celebrity girlfriend after being seen taking Amy Childs out for a meal.

The AFC Bournemouth right back took Childs, who used to appear in TV's TOWIE, to Alec's eatery in Brentwood, Essex, on Thursday.

The 24-year-old Childs and Smith were snapped walking through the town on their way to the restaurant.
