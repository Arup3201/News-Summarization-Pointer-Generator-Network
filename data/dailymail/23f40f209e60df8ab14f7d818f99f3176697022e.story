After months of speculation, Jennifer Lopez has confirmed she won't be returning to the American Idol judging panel.

The star was crying as she made the admission during a radio interview with Ryan Seacrest this morning.

The 42-year-old seemed reluctant to officially make the announcement but told Ryan, who is the host of the TV talent show, that her time as a judge is up.

I quit: Jennifer Lopez has confirmed she will not be returning to the American Idol judging panel

She choked up as she said: 'It's just really going to be hard for me to go. It’s just one of those special things in your life that you just don’t want to walk away from.'

And the star, who was a judge for two seasons, insisted her toing and froing over the decision had nothing to do with trying to garner a bigger paycheck.

She told Ryan: 'It wasn’t ever playing any games or doing anything or wanting more and more money. It wasn’t any of that. It was just being smart about making a business decision and I had to really be responsible in that moment.'

Jennifer added: 'You don’t want to shut the door completely, but you know, the time has come ... we had an amazing run.'

Ryan also confirmed the news on his Twitter page, posting: 'Just confirmed w/ @JLo she's made up her mind...will leave idol. :( gonna miss her.'

It comes just one day after her fellow judge, Steven Tyler, revealed he was quitting the show to focus on his band Aerosmith.

True
to his idiosyncratic character, Tyler wrote in his statement: 'After 
some long ... hard ... thoughts ... I’ve decided it’s time for 
me to let go of my mistress American Idol before she boils my rabbit,' TMZ reports.

The
64-year-old was making reference to a scene from the film Fatal 
Attraction - in which a deranged woman kills her lover's daughter's pet 
rabbit.

He went on: 'I 
strayed from my first love, Aerosmith, and I'm back – but instead of 
begging on my hands and knees, I've got two fists in the air and I'm 
kicking the door open with my band.'

Steven
admits he 'loved every minute' of his time on American Idol after 
having 'over-the-top fun', but he is now committed to 'bringing rock 
back' with the I Don't Want to Miss a Thing hitmakers.

Tongues
 were wagging over whether or not Jennifer would also be departing 
following hints she made during an appearance on the Today Show 
yesterday.

The mother-of-two mused: 'Maybe it's 
time for me to go. It's been on my mind a lot, as you can imagine, and 
now it's like, "Do we continue on this journey?"

'I've loved it so much. I enjoy the show so much... It's a tough decision either way.'

There are also rumours that the third and final judge, Randy Jackson, may be axed to make way for an entirely new panel.

Speaking today, Jackson, 56, said he will love Lopez and Tyler 'for life' following their American Idol exits.

In a statement to E!, Randy – who is the only original panellist on the talent show since it launched in 2002 – said: 'Steven and Jennifer are truly two of the most talented and consummate professionals I've worked with.

'I was friends with them before we hopped on this crazy journey together and I have no doubt our friendships will continue long after. I will love them for life.'

It seems Jennifer could be replaced by Mariah Carey, after reports surfaced that the diva is in 'serious talks' to sign on.

A shoulder to cry on: No doubt Jennifer will be comforted by toyboy Casper Smart, who tweeted a picture of himself with his lady love yesterday
