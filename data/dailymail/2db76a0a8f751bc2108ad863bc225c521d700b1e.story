Colin Montgomerie has called on Phil Mickelson to 'stand up to the plate' and become the USA's Ryder Cup captain.

But the eight-time Order of Merit champion has warned that the only way Mickelson can save face is by winning the next biennial battle against the Europeans.

After the USA's heavy Ryder Cup defeat at Gleneagles last year Mickelson was scathing in his criticism of the team's captain Tom Watson, claiming former captain Paul Azinger and his pod system were far superior.

Montgomerie, a former European Ryder Cup-winning captain, referred to the 'uncomfortable' feeling created by Mickelson's remarks.

Speaking to KICCA.com, he said: 'Phil Mickelson's comments were heard and read around the world.

'A lot of people were thinking 'stand up to the plate'. OK, if you feel that strongly about the situation become captain yourself.

'The trouble there, of course, is Phil would have to win the Ryder Cup, having said what he said, so it does put pressure on the whole system.'

A task force has been put together to find the next Ryder Cup captain after the Americans lost eight of the last 10 events - with calls for Azinger to return and Freddie Couples also in the running.
