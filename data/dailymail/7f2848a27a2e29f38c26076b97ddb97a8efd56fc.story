Ms Guinness, 47, sold the penthouse, which overlooks Covent Garden, a couple of years ago and it is now back on the market for £6.95million. 

Two years ago the heiress to the Guinness brewing empire sold another property, her  apartment on Fifth Avenue, New York, for $14million - just over £9million.

Visitors to the London flat are greeted with a generous  reception room and open-plan kitchen-dining room - making it perfect for entertaining. There are also two generous en-suite bedrooms for guests to enjoy.

Upstairs, the breathtaking master suite spans the entire  floor and has been carefully designed to incorporate a number of bespoke fitted wardrobes and an adjoining living room which can be closed off from the living space by two large sliding screens.

Exposed, high beam ceilings and fitted bookshelves add a warm and welcoming touch to the bright and airy space. 

The master bathroom has been created with black marble and luxurious bath and sink top with art deco-style mirrored finishes. The unique shower room includes an integrated music system and fibre-optic lighting, allowing residents to control the ambiance of the room.

In addition, the rear of the property features a large terrace that offers views of the BT tower and the rooftops of central London - giving the owner plenty of space to host parties when the nights grow longer.

Becky Fatemi, managing director of estate agents Rokstone said: 'This exceptional penthouse has been designed for fashion Icon, Daphne Guinness, meaning that the buyer of this apartment will not only own a home in a desirable part of London but also live in exceptionally beautiful surroundings, both internally and externally.

'Covent Garden is a vibrant place to live, with an array of high quality shops and restaurants a short stroll away. The current owners are from Asia, a nationality which is becoming increasingly interested in property in WC2 for both investment and a place to live, due to its proximity to cultural delights such as the Opera House and to be close to the river.

'We have also received a surge of enquiries from Middle Easterners looking to move into the area. The property also comes with a separate parking space by negotiation, further adding to its appeal.' 

The exterior façade is completed with red brick and Portland stone and dates back to 1877 and was designed by Henry Clutton. The building was originally occupied by a linen draper by the name of Boyd Burnet and Company. 

King Street has been home to a range of notable residents over the centuries. The adjoining building, no 43 King Street is the former home of Admiral Edward Russell, grandson of the fourth Earl of Bedford. 

Edward Russell played an important leading part in bringing William of Orange to England and was treasurer of the Navy and fleet in the French war in 1689-97.
