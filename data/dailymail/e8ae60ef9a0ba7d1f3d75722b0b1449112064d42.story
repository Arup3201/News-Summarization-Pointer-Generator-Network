The state pension is a ‘right’ earned over a lifetime and not a benefit, a minister has said.

Pensions minister Steve Webb said the elderly were driven ‘up the wall’ by politicians lumping the weekly payment with other welfare payments.

Mr Webb said the government was going to stop referring to the state pension, worth £113 a week, as a benefit because of the stigma attached to claiming welfare.

Pensions minister Steve Webb said it was 'shocking' to lump the state pension in with other benefits

Labour has previously suggested that the state pension could be included in a future welfare cap after the election.

But Mr Webb said that defining it as a benefit in that way would be ‘shocking’.

He said: ‘Labour want to put it in the welfare cap, which is shocking really. If you have an over-spend on [one benefit], then you might cut the state pension to make up the shortfall.

‘That completely undermines what the state pension is. To include it in the welfare cap would be quite wrong.’

The Lib Dem minister told The Telegraph: ‘The law refers to the state pension as a benefit and has done since the war.

‘As our research shows, it drives pensioners up the wall if you talk about claiming a benefit rather than the state pension.

‘Absolutely rightly, it is yours by right, you have paid your national insurance contributions. There's a certain amount of stigma about claiming benefits, when people draw their state pension that's not how they think of it.’

The Government's annual 'benefits' bill is dominated by state pension payments, which accounts for more than £1 in every £2 spent on welfare

The Department for Work and Pensions has accepted that it needs to consider the ‘tone and wording’ it uses when discussing the state pension.

The state pension is something that elderly people feel that they have ‘built up entitlement to’ by working, the Government has said.
