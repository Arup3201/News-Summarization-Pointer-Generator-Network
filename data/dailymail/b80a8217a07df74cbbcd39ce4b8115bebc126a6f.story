His was supposed to be the case that showed Britain would no longer let criminals use the Human Rights Act to dodge deportation.

But this violent Chinese burglar has still not been told to leave the country – despite judges saying he should be booted out last Monday.

The Daily Mail found Lin Chen – released from jail half-way through a five-year sentence for tying up and threatening to kill two women – enjoying a cigarette as he walked the streets of London.

He said he had no idea he was set to be deported under a tough new regime, despite attending two appointments with immigration officials since last Monday’s judgment.

When told of the latest ruling, Chen said he had no plans to leave the new three-bedroom semi in North London he shares with his Chinese wife and their son, six, and daughter, three. He is now seeking legal aid for a six-figure fight to stay put – even though his father-in-law had the cash to settle a £200,000 debt while he was in jail.

The greying Chen – who claims to be 28 – was amazed to be told he faces deportation. ‘Every Wednesday I have to report to the big immigration centre [in Croydon, south London],’ he said.

‘They didn’t tell me anything about me being deported last week, or this week.

‘My lawyer told me it would cost £100,000 to appeal to the European courts. I’m going to try to get legal aid. I’ve got no money now.’

Asked why he could not take his wife and children to China as judges suggested, Chen said: ‘My children are British citizens. In China, I didn’t have a house or anything, and everything has changed since I was there. What job could I do there?

‘Here, I can work in a kitchen, be a driver ... anything is easy because I’ve lived here for a long time.’

Chen was not keen to dwell on the two counts of robbery he pleaded guilty to in 2010. He entered the home of two sleeping women in the middle of the night, tied them up and terrorised them into telling him their PINs – but after one victim escaped her restraints and called the police, officers caught Chen hiding in the toilet.

Claiming he made ‘about £200’ in the robbery, Chen said: ‘I don’t understand the law here. I do something wrong – I’m guilty, I go to jail.

‘I owed somebody money, and they said they wanted to kill me, so I made a mistake. They [his victims] left the door open, that’s how I got in. But I’ve done my sentence. Since then I’ve done nothing wrong.’

Originally from the bustling province of Fujian on the south-eastern coast of China, Chen came to England in 2002 when he claimed to be 16 – but social services decided he was at least two years older.

Denied asylum in August of that year, he stayed on illegally. His wife, who came to Britain as an accountancy student in 2001, had their son in 2007, and Chen was duly granted ‘indefinite leave to remain’.

It was Home Secretary Theresa May who said when Chen was jailed in 2010 that he would have to be deported upon release. Yet when that time came – just halfway through his sentence – Chen battled to stay, invoking the Human Rights Act’s ‘right to a family life’.

A first hearing by immigration judges ruled in his favour – but two years later, the Court of Appeal said he should be kicked out after the Home Secretary changed the law to force judges to only consider the right to a family life in ‘exceptional cases’.

Mrs May said last week: ‘I welcome this judgment, which sends out a clear message to foreign nationals who break the law that they face deportation and can no longer exploit the system to stay in the UK.’

Her new laws have slashed the number of grounds on which foreign criminals can challenge rulings from 17 to four, as well as banning them from continually bringing up ‘new evidence’ to keep their cases dragging on.

A Home Office spokesman said last night that Chen was free on immigration bail pending any appeal he may make against deportation.

A government source added: ‘Lin Chen is not on a fast plane to China because he’s still got several appeal routes – and it’s difficult to say how long he’s got to try them.’

The National Audit Office warned last week that each foreign criminal costs the taxpayer an average of £70,000 a year, adding up to a total bill of about £1billion a year.
