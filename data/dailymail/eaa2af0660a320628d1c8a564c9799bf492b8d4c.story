Norway coach Per-Mathias Högmo has urged 15-year-old starlet Martin Odegaard to resist a move to the Premier League.

The Stromsgodset midfielder is part of Hogmo's squad for this week's Euro qualifiers. 

He has already spent time training at Manchester United and his father met with United officials at the end of last season. 

Liverpool and AS Monaco have also posted scouts on a regular basis to monitor his progress.

But Hogmo said: ‘He has already made his debut with the national team, but also at club level, he will have to take a step forward.

The 15-year-old has been urged to resist the overtures from big clubs by his national team manager 

'He is a special talent, but it is not easy to say what would be the next best move. He has two choices. 

'Whether he goes to a mid-range club that helps his development, such as Ajax, or he goes directly to an absolute top club. 

'You can see that most players that take the second route don't usually succeed.’
