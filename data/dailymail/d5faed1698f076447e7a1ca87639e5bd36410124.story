The mother of two children seen in a viral video being rescued from a locked car in Texas this week has spoken out for the first time since the incident, insisting that she was not getting a haircut at the time.

A cellphone video recorded by a bystander at a strip mall in the Houston suburb of Katy Monday captured the moment a group of shoppers smashed the windows of a black Jeep with a hammer and pulled out a pair of crying children.

It has been reported that the mother of the little boy and girl rescued from the hot car locked her kids in the back of her car to go to a hair salon.

Desperate measures: Some shoppers at a Texas strip mall were so desperate to get two kids out of a hot car that they smashed a window with a hammer

Screaming kids: The rescue was caught on camera by a nearby shop owner who said the two kids were screaming and crying. Even after they smashed the window, they had trouble getting them out because of child safety locks

However, the woman told a local TV station Tuesday that she accidentally left her keys inside the Jeep after placing her children in the backseat as the family were preparing to take off.

And eyewitnesses have backed the woman's claims, saying that it was the mother who asked a passerby to break the window in her vehicle.

Speaking
 by phone with ABC13, the mother, who declined to give her name, said 
that she was buckling in her son and daughter in their seats when the 
car keys slipped from her hand.

It was not until she already closed the door and hit the lock button that she realized the keys were left in the backseat.

The
 frantic parent ran into a hair salon for help, called her insurance 
company and asked to send someone to open her car, but she was informed 
that it would take two hours.

With temperatures hovering near 100 degrees Monday, the woman told the station she panicked.

As the mother cried for help, two men approached her offering to open the car.

Misunderstanding: The mother, seen in the video climbing through the window to pull her children to safety, said she locked her kids in the backseat not realizing that she had dropped her car keys inside

The first Good Samaritan tried to break the rear window with a tool, but the piece of equipment broke.

Then a second man grabbed a hammer from his truck and smashed the window, reported Fox 13.

The
 viral cell phone video of the rescue shows that it was the mother who 
climbed into the back of the Jeep to retrieve her two crying kids.

The children were locked inside the car for about five minutes, according to witnesses.

'I'm a good mother,’ the unnamed woman told ABC13. ‘Why would someone say I was getting a haircut? I love my children.’

The
 woman’s story was corroborated by the owner of the nearby hair salon, 
who said that he had no female customers at the time of the incident 
Monday.

Azir Brohl, the
 owner of Postal+ store, also came to the woman's defense, saying that 
he has surveillance video proving that the mother did not leave the 
children in the car.

Group effort: Local business owners who heard the mother's cries for help said it was she who asked two men to help her free her children from the hot Jeep

The
 footage obtained by KHOU shows the mother of two, who only recently 
moved to Katy from Florida, entering the store with the boy and girl in 
tow.

Heidy Lopez, who 
works at Postal+, told KHOU that after finishing her errands, the mother
 and two kids left the store together and went back to the car

That is when the woman apparently locked the keys inside the big black Jeep along with her children.

‘She was screaming trying to get the little girl to open the door,’ said eyewitnesses Gabriel del Valle.
