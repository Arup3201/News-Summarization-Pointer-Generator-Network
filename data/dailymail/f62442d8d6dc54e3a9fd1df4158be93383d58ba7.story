Librarians at the University of Leeds have dusted off what is thought to be the one of first portable and travel sized library of books.

Long before books were stored on a Kindle, smartphone or tablet, the Jacobean miniature travelling library was the only way literature fans could carry a large number of books.

The miniature library was contained in a wooden case, bound in brown turkey leather, disguising it as a large folio volume, containing three shelves of gold-tooled vellum-bound books.

Now it may not be backlit or be able to use Wi-Fi, but back in 17th century England only four families were lucky enough to have one.

Stella Butler, University Librarian and Keeper of the Brotherton Collection, said: 'The Jacobean travelling library - one of only four made - dates from 1617 and is one of the most curious items in the Brotherton Collection. The miniature books are contained in a wooden case disguised to look like a large book. It's essentially a 17th century e-book reader such as a Kindle.'

The books within are all small in format and bound in limp vellum covers with coloured fabric ties. They are gold-tooled on the spine with a flower and a wreath, and all the covers have a gilt angel bearing a scroll that reads Gloria Deo.

The rare miniature travelling library dating from 1617 forms part of Leeds University's huge Brotherton Collection of rare manuscripts, photographs and books set to go public show thanks to a £1.3m Heritage Lottery grant

The catalogue inside the front cover is arranged in three columns of text within an architectural structure of arches and columns painted on a sheet of vellum.

The miniature books are a collection of about 40 mainly classical texts divided into three sections: theology and philosophy, history, poetry. They include works by Cicero, Virgil, Ovid, Seneca, Horace and Julius Caesar.

The library was reportedly commissioned by William Hakewill MP (1574-1655) for a friend at the turn of the year 1617/1618. Within a period of five years he ordered three other such libraries to be made for his friends or patrons.

The index to the books in the collection: It contains works on theology and philosophy, history and poetry - enough to cover the most demanding 17th Century appetite 

It looks just like an ordinary book albeit one that has seen a fair share of wear and tear. It is only when the 'folio' is opened hat its treasures are revealed -  three shelves of 50 gold-tooled vellum-bound books

These are now held at the British Library, the Huntington Library California, and the Toledo Museum of Art Ohio.

The recipient of the University of Leeds copy seems to have been a member of the Irish Madden family, whose arms are clearly painted beneath the catalogue of the library inside the front board.

Rare manuscripts and books, like the Jacobean miniature travelling library, will soon be going on show to the public thanks to a round of Heritage Lottery Fund grants announced last Wednesday.

The books are still in remarkable condition despite their great age. The library dates back to 1617 - just 14 years after the death of Queen Elizabeth I

The University of Leeds boasts one of the finest collections of rare books and manuscripts in the world in its Special Collections, housed in the Brotherton Library.

The breadth of subjects at the library is considered exceptional, from exquisite photographs of pre-revolutionary Russia to books dating from the beginning of printing, as well as the archives of some of the 20th century's most influential poets and writers, and much more.

Now a grant of £1,385,800 has provided the final piece of the jigsaw for a £1.9 million project for a gallery, where treasures from the Brotherton: Inspiring Audiences and Engaging Communities will go on display.

Work is expected to start on the new galleries, to be housed in the University's iconic Parkinson Building in Woodhouse Lane, next spring, with a provisional opening date of November 2015.

Work on the new library is expected to start next spring on two new climate-controlled public galleries in the university's Parkinson building to showcase some of the 200,000 books and thousands of manuscripts including the Jacobean Kindle
