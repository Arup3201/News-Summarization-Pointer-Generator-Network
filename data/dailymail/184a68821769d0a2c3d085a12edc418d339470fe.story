Straphangers who are late for work or school can get an 'excuse note' from the New York City subway explaining to their boss or teacher the reason for their late arrival.

The wintry weather often leads to delays on the roads and rails leading to frayed nerves of both workers and their superiors.

Those delayed through no fault of their own can file an online delay verification form, akin to a transit doctor's note.

Train traffic ahead: New York's MTA which runs the city subway is providing commuters with 'late notes' they can give to their bosses if their train is delayed on the way to work

The transit agency will write back in about three weeks or so with a note detailing whether a delay occurred on a specific line at a particular time.

Its usage has steadily increased with around 6,000 requests each month. Tardy individuals can also write or phone in their delays as well.

The online form allows riders to get information on delays that happened within the past 90 days.

If the delay dates back further than 90 days, a rider will have to submit a Freedom of Information Law request.

'Those people who are more computer savvy or are more prone to use a computer are finding that it's a service that's easier to use and it's also quicker,' said Paul Fleuranges, the agency’s director of corporate communications told the New York Times. 'We’d rather be at 100 percent on-time performance. But, nobody’s perfect.'

Subway trains make about 8,000 trips during an average weekday, with close to 600 trains in operation during the height of the rush hour.

NYC Transit officials say track work, mechanical problems, sick customers and police investigations inevitably hold up trains during the course of an average working day.

A version of the system has existed for decades but the number of requests has tripled since the MTA's system went online.

The agency has written out more than 250,000 notes since the service first began in June of 2010.

Passengers need only provide their subway line, times and locations of entering and exiting the train and the MTA will issue a response.

'There was a disruption in service, specifically signal trouble, sick customer, brakes in emergency and track circuit failure, which caused massive service delays, reroutes and/or trains to be discharged on the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, A, B, C, D, F, J, L, M, N, Q and R lines,' one recent response read, in part. 'As a result, any one delay lasted up to 82 minutes.'

Marcus Greer, who travels from South Jamaica, Queens, to his job as a security guard in Midtown told the Times that the service had helped keep punctuality-related blemishes off his permanent file. Workers who accrue too many can be fired, he said.

'Before the system was in place, they would give you a write-up right off the bat,” he said. “Even if you were late by the train, it just goes in your folder.'

In another instance, Tom Weppler, 48, an IT engineer asked for a delay verification in October 2012 after showing up to work an hour late.

Delayed arrival: Wintry weather often leads to more delays on the city's transit system. Despite setting off early to work, commuters can be delayed. The MTA now provides letters explaining why passengers were late

A day later, Mr. Weppler was train trouble had affected 16 subway lines. 'As a result,' the authority’s response read, 'any one delay lasted up to 395 minutes,' or 6 hours 35 minutes.

'I could have gone to see a really long movie and had lunch if I’d known I was going to be excused for that long,' he said.

Smaller holdup are not recorded however. The MTA says it considers any train that reached its destination 'no more than five minutes late' to be on time.

In October commuters took more than 165 million trips and the authority responded to more than 8,200 late note requests, according to preliminary agency data.

A staff of eight fields the delay letter requests as well as all other complaints related to service issues.

The letters, printed on NYC Transit letterhead, generally describe the maximum delay a certain line experienced during certain hours in the morning.

It takes about five days to respond to an online request and up to three weeks for the delayed-excuse note to be written, by which time of course, your boss may very well have forgotten you were ever late in the first place.
