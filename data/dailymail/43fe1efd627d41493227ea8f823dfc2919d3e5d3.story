Police say they are becoming 'increasingly concerned' over a missing fitness instructor who is at the centre of a search after she failed to arrive at work today.

Katie Bell was believed to be driving her black Fiat Bravo when she went missing earlier today.

The alarm was raised by a family member after the 28-year-old left a house in Banstead in Surrey to travel to work but didn't arrive.

Police say they are increasingly concerned for the welfare of Katie Bell, pictured, who was last seen leaving the house in her black Fiat Bravo to go to work 

Detectives are now understood to be examining automatic number plate recognition cameras in a bid to discover where he may have been heading.

Miss Bell is a zumba instructor at Fiesta Fitness, based in Morden, Surrey, and teaches classes in Chessington.

A spokesman for Surrey Police said: 'Her disappearance is completely out of character - we do not believe she has ever gone missing before.

'The police are growing increasingly concerned for the welfare Katie Bell, who was reported missing this morning after she failed to turn up for work.

Miss Bell, is a fitness instructor at Fitness First in Morden, Surrey but failed to arrive at work this morning 

'She drives a black Fiat Bravo with the registration number starting in KM09', the spokesman added.

However, the spokesman said police were refusing to disclose the full details of her car.

Miss Bell is described as white, with shoulder-length blonde hair and is around five foot two inches tall and of slim to medium build.

The police spokesman added: 'Officers are urging anyone who has seen Katie who has links to Epsom, Ewell and Chessington to contact them with information.

'Katie can also contact officers, friends and family through the charity Missing People by calling or texting 116 000

It was not believed she had any medical problems which could be associated with her disappearance.
