Innocent: The assault case against Corey Barker was thrown out of court after the magistrate viewed CCTV footage of his arrest

Confronting CCTV footage from inside a police station on the New South Wales far north coast has led to six police officers being charged with assault and perjury offences after the integrity commission found they used excessive force. 

Aboriginal man Corey Barker, then 23, was arrested on 14 January 2011 following a fight in Ballina.

He was arrested and taken to Ballina police station, where six officers were involved in a 'violent' confrontation with Mr Barker.

They alleged that he punched one of the officers, David Hill, in the face and he was charged with assault.

However Ballina magistrate David Heilpern dismissed the case after the CCTV - originally believed to be damaged - was shown in court.

He also referred the case to the NSW Police Integrity Commision after ruling that the police had given false evidence in the hearing.

The six police officers will front court next month after being slapped with a slew of assault and perjury charges, laid by the PIC on the recommendation of the Department of Public Prosecutions.

The shocking CCTV footage allegedly shows the six officers wrestling Mr Barker to the ground and kneeing him in a violent arrest on 14 January 2011.

A total of 25 charges were laid against the cops, following a lengthy report compiled by the PIC, as part of Operation Barmouth.

'In the process (of his arrest) Barker’s body was forced against a bin and a chair in a corner of the (breath analysis system) room. The machine in the BAS room was visibly displaced by the impact of Barker’s body,' the report stated.

'The police treatment of Barker can fairly be described as violent.'

Constable Lee Walmsley, former constable Luke Mewing, senior constable Mark Woolven, former sergeant Robert McCubben, constable Ryan Eckersley and senior constable David Hill were all subsequently charged under the Crimes Act in relation to the alleged mistreatment of Mr Barker and alleged lies about the events surrounding his arrest.

They accused Mr Barker of punching senior constable Hill in the face, but that was not shown in the CCTV footage shown in court.

According to the PIC investigation, the officers gave false and misleading statements as part of their evidence in the assault case against Corey Barker, which was dismissed by magistrate David Heilpern after the CCTV was shown to the court.

The PIC concluded: 'that Barker did not assault Hill as alleged and, in particular, did not punch, or even attempt to punch, Hill on the nose or face.'

The report also found that Barker, then 23, was kept handcuffed in a cell at the station for around 100 minutes.

'Barker was dragged to a cell in the police station by police officers holding the handcuffs on Barker’s hands, head first, on his stomach, with his arms forced high above his head against the natural inclination of his arms,' the report stated.

'This method of taking Barker to a cell involved excessive force.'

Four of the six police officers were charged with common assault and all were either charged with either perjury or perverting the course of justice.

The PIC sent the set of charges to the Department of Public Prosecutions for consideration. The DPP later recommended the charges and will prosecute the cases.

'It took so much to prove that I was innocent, just because they're officers,' Barker earlier told ABC radio.

'You're meant to be confident in going out in the street.

'Some people have been proud of me that I'm fighting it. Other people have been taking it differently "oh you know it's just another black person mucked up in custody and now they've copped a beating and now they're out crying" but it wasn't nothing like that.'

The six men will appear in Downing Centre local court on 17 July.
