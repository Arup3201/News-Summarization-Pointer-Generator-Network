Nick Clegg today launched an extraordinary attack on the aid charity Oxfam, claiming there is 'nothing liberal' about its advert criticising the Government’s austerity programme.

The Deputy Prime Minister warned the opposition to reducing the nation's debts for future generations would damage 'the values Oxfam is supposed to be campaigning for'.

Government anger at erupted at the campaign which accused ministers of creating a ‘perfect storm’, including ‘benefit cuts’ and ‘unemployment’, which is forcing people into poverty.

The Oxfam Twitter advert has been criticised by Tory MPs who warned the charity would lose support

Tory MPs called for the charities watchdog to investigate the mock film poster which also attacked zero-hours contracts, childcare costs and 'high prices'.

But Mr Clegg is the first senior Lib Dem to condemn the stunt, sparking a major row with the charity which is usually seen as an ally by the party.

He accused Oxfam of opposing the difficult decisions needed to bring down the deficit and lift the burden of debt.

Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg told LBC: 'There is nothing fair, there is nothing progressive, there is nothing liberal, there is nothing in line with Oxfam’s values to say: "Oh, it’s all too difficult, we’ll basically get our kids and our grandkids to pay off this generation’s debts’ because that’s what underlines all of this."

'It appears to be an advertisement that is a blanket refusal to deal with a problem that you cannot duck.

'I really cannot understand how some people whose values I share of compassion, of seeking to make sure we do help the most vulnerable, are so willing to just airbrush out of the equation that you’ve got to – because it’s the fair thing to do – clear the decks for future generations.'

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg accused Oxfam of ignoring the difficult decisions which need to be taken to tackle the nation's debts

Mr Clegg said he 'flatly rejects' the idea that the government had failed to act on many of the issues raised, including childcare. 

'Yes, there are some really difficult decisions to be made; yes, there are people who are feeling huge pressure on their daily, weekly budgets. 

'But I really think just saying "why do we have to do anything? Can’t we just wave a magic wand and it will all be sorted?" 

'I don’t think that helps anyone; and I don’t actually think it helps the values Oxfam is supposed to be campaigning for.'

Conservative MP Priti Patel, a member of the Number Ten policy advisory board, said Oxfam was 'behaving disgracefully'

Oxfam has insisted it had a ‘duty’ to highlight hardship in the UK, but Tories branded its attack a ‘disgrace’ as official figures showed another record increase in the number of people in work.

Conservative MP Priti Patel, a member of the Number Ten policy advisory board, said: ‘Oxfam are behaving disgracefully by misleading the public about Government policies and their political campaigning may be in breach of their charitable remit.

‘They have shown their true colours and are now nothing more than a mouthpiece for left wing propaganda.’

Conservative MP Dominic Raab said: ‘It is sad, when a charity doing such great work abroad to alleviate poverty, becomes embroiled in politically partisan attacks in an attempt to compete with all the other head-in-the-sand left-wing groups and grab a few headlines”

Political commentator Tim Montgomerie, former chief of staff to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, said: ‘I won’t be giving to Oxfam again. I want to help the poorest people of the world, not finance left-wing politics.’

Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative MP, accused Oxfam of engaging in an overtly ‘political’ that was not borne out by the facts.

‘My concern is that charities should walk the walk - helping make a difference to people at the front line - not talk the talk - engage in advertising or political campaigning. They should make a difference to people in their daily life,’ he said.

‘I think we can all see the messaging here and what Oxfam is intending to say. My bigger concern in many ways is that a lot of it is not accurate; we have got a government that is reforming zero-hours contracts, we have seen unemployment fall by 400,000, we have seen inequality - the gap between the rich and the poor - falling, we have seen relative poverty falling, and we have seen food poverty falling according to OECD figures.’ 

Ben Phillips, Oxfam’s campaigns and policy director, defended the advert, arguing the campaign was not political and that the charity has a duty to draw attention to the hardship ‘suffered by poor people we work with in the UK.’

‘Fighting poverty should not be a party political issue,’ he added.

The Charity Commission said it was considering a complaint about the campaign to determine whether a full-scale inquiry should be launched.
