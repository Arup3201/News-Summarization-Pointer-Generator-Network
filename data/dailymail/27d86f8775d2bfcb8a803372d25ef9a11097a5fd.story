It was a devastating inferno which engulfed one of Britain’s finest buildings and destroyed a world famous educational facility.

But six months after a devastating blaze ripped through the Mackintosh Library at the Glasgow School of Art, fresh attempts are being made to recover some of its treasured contents.

Many items were lost forever when the library went up in flames in May as students were making last-minute adjustments to their final-year degree show work.

Destroyed: Forensic archaeologist Owen Godbert begins the task of sifting through the ashes of the fire-damaged Mackintosh Library at the Glasgow School of Art 

Restoration: An expert exams part of a wooden doorway salvaged from the burnt-out rubble in the interior of the historic building

Burnt out: Experts have started the painstaking task of examining the the charred remains of the library - and picking out anything capable of being restored

But today, forensic archaeologists began the painstaking task of sifting through the ashes of the fire-damaged library in the hope of rescuing books, furniture and other artefacts.

The work is being undertaken by Kirkdale Archaeology as part of a wider restoration project that is expected to cost £20million.

The BBC quoted Alison Stevenson, head of libraries, archives and collections at the Glasgow School of Art as saying: 'Immediately after the fire, with support from Historic Scotland, the GSA was able to remove substantial amounts of material from the Mackintosh Building.

'We are now turning to what is at once the most complex and potentially most revealing project in terms of conservation.

'Although the library was destroyed in the fire there are significant remains which we hope will retain artefacts or fragments that will prove invaluable both in terms of our archival records and our restoration plans.'

The Grade I listed Mackintosh Building, founded 175 years ago, in Scotland Street, Glasgow, was significantly damaged in the blaze. But after dozens of fire fighters descended on the scene, the blaze was brought under control enabling many items to be rescued. Miraculously there were no casualties in the fire.

At the time it was reported that the blaze may have started in the basement of the building. 

Earlier this year, hundreds of thousands of pounds in charitable donations were raised to help restore the Glasgow School of Art and its fire damaged library. 

The Hugh Fraser Foundation, a long-term supporter of the school, pledged £300,000 while the Cameron Mackintosh Foundation, which supports art projects, committed £250,000. 

It added to a UK Government pledge of £5million and a Scottish Government commitment to match funds up to £5million to support the restoration. 

It is thought it will cost £20million to properly restore the renowned Grade A-listed building. Around 10 per cent of the structure of the building, including the unique library, was destroyed in the blaze.

Writer Muriel Gray, chairwoman of Glasgow School of Art, said she hoped to see a library in operation in four years.

The School of Art has produced a host of famous alumni across the creative fields over the past 165 years.

As well as renowned artists, former students include members of the bands Travis and Franz Ferdinand, and actors Peter Capaldi and Robbie Coltrane.

Several winners of the prestigious Turner Prize studied at Glasgow School of Art (GSA), including Martin Boyce, who scooped the prize in 2011 for his installation Do Words Have Voices, beating what critics felt was the strongest shortlist for many years.

Graduate Douglas Gordon took the prize in 1996 while it was won by Richard Wright in 2009. Simon Starling also picked up the accolade in 2005.

Dozens of fire fighters descended on the scene and used aerial ladders and hose reels to try and dampen the flames

As well as being a celebrated art school, Charles Rennie Mackintosh's building was listed and was a tourist attraction in its own right

This year three out of the four candidates for the UK's best-known art award - worth £25,000 - studied at the school.

As well as being a celebrated art school, Charles Rennie Mackintosh's building was listed and was a tourist attraction in its own right.

Construction work started on the building in 1897 after Mackintosh won a design competition while working for Glasgow architects Honeyman and Keppie.

Widely regarded as his best work, the long E shaped Rennie Mackintosh school was voted as the best building in the last 175 years in a survey for the Royal Institute of British Architects.

The first half of the building was completed in 1899, but the art nouveau design in the Gatehill area took another 12 years to finish.
