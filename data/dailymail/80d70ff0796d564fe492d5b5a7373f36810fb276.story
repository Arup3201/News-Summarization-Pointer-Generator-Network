More than 7,000 homeowners have banned the BBC’s TV licence fee enforcers from visiting them.

As MPs prepare to vote tomorrow on plans to decriminalise non-payment, it emerged last night that growing numbers are taking advantage of a legal loophole.

Any homeowner can legally remove the ‘implied right of access’ to their front doorstep, effectively threatening to sue licence fee collectors for trespass if they continue to visit.

Between February 2012 and January this year, 5,726 people contacted the BBC to do so, a Freedom of Information request has revealed.

Up to December 2011, just 1,573 people 
had withdrawn the right of access, so there has been a huge jump in the 
past two years. In total, 7,299 households have now withdrawn access.

Although they are officially named ‘enforcement officers’, TV Licensing staff – who are employed by private firm Capita on the BBC’s behalf – do not possess any official powers of arrest and cannot enter homes or search property without permission.

The 334 staff make four million home visits a year to gather evidence of licence fee evasion, leading to around 180,000 prosecutions.

However, homeowners have complained of being harassed even when they do not own a TV, while letters have been sent to the families of viewers who are long dead.

Keira Knightley, 28, has said she was ‘hounded by TV licence people’ even though she did not own a TV.

Under BBC policy, all requests to remove the right of access are honoured as enforcers would be trespassing if they kept visiting.

Tomorrow’s debate will see MPs consider an amendment to the Deregulation Bill which would decriminalise non-payment of the fee in 2016.

Downing Street has backed the plans, put forward by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen after a petition was signed by 150 MPs from each of the three main political parties.

MPs are to vote tomorrow on whether to decriminalise non-payment. Last year 180,000 people went to court for the crime, and 70 ended up in jail

Last night Mr Bridgen said homeowners withdrawing access shows growing anger towards the BBC: ‘It is clear that a large proportion of the public resent the BBC’s heavy-handed way of collecting the fee.’

Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The fact that increasing numbers are using their right to withdraw access to TV licensing officials is further evidence that the days of the licence fee appear increasingly numbered.’

A TV Licensing spokesman said it uses ‘other forms of detection’ when right of access is withdrawn. He said any complaints about staff are thoroughly investigated. 

BBC programmes could be blocked for those who don't pay the licence fee under new rules being considered

Ministers are thought to be considering plans to block access to BBC programmes for licence fee cheats.

If laws are passed to decriminalise fee evasion, the corporation will seek new powers to enforce payment.

Senior BBC officials have repeatedly warned that removing the threat of jail could see evasion rates rise by 5 per cent, leading to losses of around £200million a year.

One way to stop fee dodgers would be to cut off TV signals from those who fail to pay, in the same way as Sky or Virgin subscribers lose access.

Since the digital switchover, it is possible to encrypt TV programmes so they can only be watched through sets equipped with smart cards.

However, the BBC claims it would be prohibitively expensive to upgrade set-top boxes around the country with the new technology.

At present, most viewers watch BBC shows through Freeview boxes, which do not have such systems installed.

BBC strategy chief James Purnell said: ‘We think the cost of running the subscription system would be greater than the licence fee system.’

This allows them to sue collectors for trespass if they repeatedly visit
