Globetrotting MPs  have squandered more than £1million of taxpayers’ cash  flying to exotic locations.

Since 2010, select committee members have organised over 100 foreign trips to places as far afield as Rio de Janeiro, Hong Kong, Miami and Cancun.

Parliamentary accounts show the junkets have racked up costs of almost £1.4million, with ten visits costing more than £40,000 each.

Fact-finding: MPs have chosen some of the world's most fabulous and glamorous locations, including Rio de Janeiro, as destinations for fact-finding missions - and taxpayers have had to foot the bill

One trip alone, organised by the Treasury select committee to Singapore and China, cost more than £72,000.

The
Energy and Climate Change committee, led by green energy supporter Tim 
Yeo, spent £48,727 sending six MPs to China as part of an inquiry into 
‘low carbon growth links’, and £40,044 on a trip for four MPs to Dallas 
and Washington DC to investigate shale gas.

Other
trips include a £48,549 visit to Australia and Hong Kong by the culture
committee to  investigate gambling and a £48,559 visit to Miami and 
Colombia by the home affairs committee as part of an inquiry into drugs.

The
most profligate committee was international development, which 
investigates how well aid money is spent. It racked up £207,250 on trips
to Africa, India and the US.

Matthew
Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘With 
video-conferencing facilities able to connect MPs with other politicians
or experts around the world at little cost, they should always be 
asking whether foreign travel is strictly necessary in the first place.

‘But when these trips end up costing 
£8,000 or £10,000 per MP, something has clearly gone very wrong and 
taxpayers’ money has not been spent as carefully as it should be.’

The
House of Commons accounts for the 2010/12 parliamentary session show 
select committees organised 110 foreign trips and 190 domestic ones.

The total cost was £1,366,718. The most common visit was to Brussels, where MPs investigated the EU’s impact on policy.

The
most expensive was the Treasury select committee’s visit to Singapore 
and China as part of an inquiry into ‘global imbalances’.

Nine MPs went on the trip, which cost £72,132.

Even when MPs restricted themselves to domestic trips, they still racked up large bills.

The business committee spent £2,682 on a trip to Sheffield to investigate apprenticeships and the work and pensions committee spent £3,302 visiting Burnley to discuss incapacity benefit.

In addition, select committees spent £20,088 on ‘entertainment and minor expenses’.

Keith Vaz’s Home Affairs committee was top of the list with £2,393.
