The couple's friends and family went along with their Disney theme, with guests dressing as Minnie Mouse, Freddie Flintstone, Woody from Toy Story and Cruella de Vil

Toni was brought up in Plymouth, but met Eric while working on a banana farm in Mareeba, Queensland.

The couple, who have set up home in Australia, flew back to Devon so she could marry in her home town.

Healthcare worker Toni, who dressed as Belle, said 'Everyone gets married in white - I grew up with Disney films and we had a pile of them. I always loved the songs.

'We were deciding what to go as when he said he wanted to go as The Beast, as he is already so hairy, and so I thought I would go as Belle.'

Toni and Eric were really pleased with their themed wedding, with Toni saying she felt just like a Disney Princess

She continued: 'The thing is, I really do feel like the fairytale princess. And I think he looks lovely.' 

Eric, a 25-year-old university biology student, said: 'I really enjoy being in Plymouth and I love the scenery. 

'We wouldn't earn as much here which is the biggest reason we're in Australia but this is a lovely place to return to.'

The bride's mother, Lynn, who went as Cruella de Vil, said 'Toni is original and likes to be different.'

Toni's taxi driver father John, dressed as Fred Flinstone, he said: 'She looks radiant. 

'When she told us we all just went along with it - we're that kind of family.'
