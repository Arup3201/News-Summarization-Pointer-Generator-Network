Roy Hodgson and Louis van Gaal have cleared the air after Manchester United’s Dutch manager gave his blessing for Luke Shaw to be selected for England’s Under-21s.

Hodgson and Van Gaal became embroiled in a spat when England’s head coach said the issue of Shaw’s fitness had been ‘mentioned’ at the World Cup finals. Van Gaal hit back by saying that Hodgson was ‘in no position’ to make such a judgment.

However, Hodgson and Van Gaal have spoken extensively in recent weeks and dealt with the issue of Shaw being made available for Gareth Southgate’s Under-21 squad for the Euro 2015 play-off against Croatia.

Hodgson and Southgate went to see Shaw , who has just returned from a hamstring problemmake his United debut in the 2-1 win over West Ham 11 days ago and Van Gaal’s felt it would be beneficial for the 18-year-old’s development — and his fitness — to be involved in two pressurised matches.

Southgate said: ‘At the moment Roy would deal with Louis direct. With some of the players I’ll deal with the first team manager but in this instance, because Roy is dealing with Louis on Wayne Rooney and hopefully others that will be involved, Roy had that conversation.

‘The last time I saw Van Gaal was in a lift in Brazil during the World Cup. It broke down on the morning they were playing Chile, so we had a laugh about that — him and Patrick Kluivert, our lift got stuck between floors, thankfully for not too long!

‘But I know from the conversation that he was really positive about him coming and playing matches. It is not something we’ve just thought “we’ll make this squad as strong as we possibly can” – we are thinking about the individuals all the time and what is the right experience for them.’

Southgate, meanwhile, has moved to clarify the situation surrounding Jonjo Shelvey’s selection for the senior squad, when he had gone more than a year without playing for the Under-21s. Hodgson’s decision was met with stinging criticism from former Under-21 head coach Stuart Pearce.

But Southgate said: ‘The first squad I selected last September, he was injured. In the October games, he was still carrying an injury and Swansea were in Europe. There was a lot going on because his girlfriend was pregnant so I didn’t think he was ready.

‘I had a good chat with him (when he arrived at St George’s Park) about it as obviously he’s thought “what have I walked into?” He wasn’t eligible for Toulon because of his age. Could I have called him back in? Yes I could, but I’m very big on the group and rewarding those that have done well.’
