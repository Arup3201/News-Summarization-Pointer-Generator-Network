Frank Lampard and Eliaquim Mangala are ready to make their Manchester City debuts as the Premier League champions face a critical run of three games in the space of eight days, Manuel Pellegrini has confirmed.

Lampard has been training with City for the last month since his shock switch from their US affiliate in New York, while Mangala has yet to play for the club following a £32million move from FC Porto.

Both men could feature in Saturday’s trip to Arsenal, the Champions League clash away to Bayern Munich or next weekend’s clash with title favourites Chelsea.

Captain Vincent Kompany has also been passed fit after suffering a calf problem while on international duty with Belgium, but Fernando has been ruled for two weeks with a muscle injury and Stevan Jovetic is also out of action after pulling a hamstring in training with Montenegro.

‘Frank is ready,’ said Pellegrini. ‘He has worked for about one month and he doesn’t have any problems. Mangala is working normally and is in the squad list also.

‘We have to play three games in a week so we will see if they play in these games. Both of them are ready to do it but I can’t say which games they will play or if they will play.

‘But we have Fernando injured. He has a muscle problem, maybe a couple of weeks more and also Stevan Jovetic. He came back from his national team with a problem in his hamstring.

‘All the rest of the players are fit. Vincent played 90 minutes for his national team and he works normally with the squad during the week here so he doesn’t have any problems.’

Addressing the media for the first time since Alvaro Negredo was allowed to leave the Etihad on loan to Valencia with a view to a permanent move, Pellegrini confirmed that the striker was the odd man out in his Champions League squad after fracturing a metatarsal in pre-season, and was also desperate to return to Spain.

Negredo’s departure after one season in English football has left City with just three recognised senior strikers. Pellegrini refused to say if they were in the running to sign Radamel Falcao before he joined neighbours Manchester United, but believes that City have enough forwards to cope.

He said: ‘The decision for Negredo to go out was for two very important reasons – first of all, we had a restriction on the number of players we can use in the Champions League, we had one player more and in this case Alvaro was injured so he was not going to be on the list.

‘For him, it was also very important that he went back to Spain so I thought that was the best decision. But it all started with the restriction on the number of players.

‘It is one striker less of course, but we have Edin Dzeko, Sergio Aguero, Stevan Jovetic and other players we can use behind the strikers. There are other options.’
