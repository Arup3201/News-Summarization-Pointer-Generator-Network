This is a massive game for Stuart Lancaster and this England team. So far he has done an excellent job and now has a very exciting team and a squad to match any in world rugby but if he could go to the World Cup as Grand Slam-winning coach it would be absolutely massive for him and the team.

As we stand, for all his hard work and endeavour, Lancaster has won nothing whereas his opposite man, Joe Schmidt, has won plenty of silverware and is widely regarded as the best coach in the world.

But make no mistake, if England do win today — and I believe they will — it will make them red-hot favourites for the Grand Slam and allow them to set sail for the World Cup in perfect fashion.

I just cannot see Scotland or France heading to Twickenham and winning, so today’s game will go a very long way to deciding if England can begin a home World Cup as the No 1 side in Europe. What a prospect.

In 2003, we went to Dublin and won well against an Irish side who were also going for the Grand Slam. It was unquestionably a defining moment, allowing us to arrive at the World Cup as firm favourites and the team everyone had to beat. 

To my mind this game is every bit as important to English rugby as that. I’m sure that the RFU will be happy with the progress England have made since Lancaster took over three years ago.

Despite some pretty conservative selections, some game-plans which were hard to fathom and the frustrations in the autumn, I believe the fans and media are also right behind him and his team.

But heading into today’s game, I sense a change in the air. There is greater expectancy than ever under Lancaster for England to win a really big game like this, especially away from home. 

It wasn’t there in the autumn and it wasn’t there against Wales where everyone seemed happy to be billed as the underdogs. But such expectancy makes it a defining game for Lancaster. 

He and England should accept that in many people’s eyes, including mine, they are favourites today based on the quality of their players and they should thrive on that expectation.

This expectation is long overdue and it is a good thing. It is a sign of progress and something every great team need to become comfortable with. Lancaster and England need to embrace the expectation. Ireland are going to have to play out of their skins to win today — that should be the mentality of this team.

In big games like this, I always look to see if a team do something differently and unexpected in the early stages. It was something I always looked to engineer.

Schmidt is an outstanding coach who is utterly meticulous with his preparation — you only have to speak to players who have worked with him to understand just how highly rated he is. Ireland’s success over the last 12 months is squarely down to him — and the level of analysis which he and his players will have done will have been huge.

So for England to do the unexpected early on will really give Ireland something to think about; they will realise they are up against a clever team. Players do not like surprises, so England need to take Ireland outside of their comfort zone in the early stages.

Like any good business or sports leader, Lancaster has done the clever thing by surrounding himself with outstanding people. My confidants were Andy Robinson and Phil Larder, who were men I admired enormously as coaches.

I would listen to them for hours before making any final decisions, especially on selection. Lancaster has brought in Andy Farrell and Mike Catt, while Graham Rowntree was already in place. It is really important he allows them to challenge his decision-making process. But ultimately, no matter how much input you get from your coaching team, it is the head coach who makes the final decision and he must live or die by it.

People talk about the loneliness of command and being the England rugby head coach is a lonely position. The buck stops with you. But it can also be enormously rewarding and can bring extraordinary highs as well as inevitable lows. In rugby, it is the best job in the world.

I’ve seen some clear signs of improvement and development from Lancaster who, let’s not forget, was appointed with no international coaching experience. He has had to learn on the hoof and I’m delighted by his selection of Jack Nowell.

Changing a winning team is never easy and it gives a firm indication he is thinking correctly and clearly. He needs to continue to be bold as this team are developing into something special.

I also think he is learning the art of substitution. It is not an exact science, nor can it be all about pre-determined decisions of when to bring a player off. But it is a critical part of a head coach’s role. 

If you get that spectacularly wrong it can have an enormously detrimental impact on your standing within the squad and the media will have a field day.

There is a lot resting on his shoulders. But if I was Lancaster, I’d be incredibly excited about what lies in store. This is England’s best chance to win a World Cup since 2003 with a tournament being played on home soil with a high-quality squad good enough to win it.

Beat Ireland and I firmly believe England will win the Grand Slam and go into the World Cup as clearly the best team in Europe, with somebody having to come to Twickenham to beat them. Lose, and all the momentum will be with Ireland.

England need to play with tempo and an enormous amount of aggression to beat Ireland. They need to explode out of the blocks and concentrate on their game and not the huge prize on offer. Do that and England will be on course for a Grand Slam and a 2015 World Cup — and lauded like no other. For Lancaster to earn his stripes, England must win by five points.
