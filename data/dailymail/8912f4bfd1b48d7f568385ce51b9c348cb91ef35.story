Stephen Lee is facing up to a snooker career in ruins after failing in his appeal to overturn a 12-match ban for match-fixing.

Lee, a five-time ranking tournament winner and former world No. 5 will not be eligible to return to competitive snooker for more than 10 years.

The 39-year-old had challenged the findings of a tribunal in September 2013 which found him guilty of fixing seven games in 2008 and 2009.

Caught out: Stephen Lee was found guilty of fixing seven games of snooker in 2008 and 2009

Stephen Lee is facing up to a snooker career in ruins after failing in his appeal to overturn a 12-match ban for match-fixing.

Lee, a five-time ranking tournament winner and former world No. 5 will not be eligible to return to competitive snooker for more than 10 years.

The 39-year-old had challenged the findings of a tribunal in September 2013 which found him guilty of fixing seven games in 2008 and 2009.

They included deliberate defeats to Ken Doherty and Marco Fu at the 2008 Malta Cup, and agreeing to lose the first frame against Stephen Hendry and Mark King at the 2008 UK Championship.

But Lee's appeal was thrown out by Nicholas Stewart QC, who also increased Lee's original costs order from £40,000 to £75,000.

The decision means Lee will not be eligible to return to competitive snooker before October 12, 2024.

The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association had initially pushed for a life ban but said they were satisfied with the punishment.

The chairman of the WPBSA's disciplinary committee, Nigel Mawer, told Sky Sports News: 'There's a degree of sadness because Stephen Lee was a fantastic player and he's thrown it all away through greed and getting involved in match-fixing.

'Basically, as a result of that, he's now finished with snooker. He's banned now until he's 50 years of age, he's exhausted all avenues of appeal.

'But it is with sadness. It's harmful to any sport when there are upheld allegations of match-fixing.

'We do have a seniors tour and there are options for people who are older to play snooker if they are good enough but if you've been away from the sport for that length of time, I think it would be very difficult for him to re-engage.'

Banished: After having his appeal rejected Lee cannot return to competitive snooker until 2024

A statement issued by the World 
Professional Billards and Snooker Association read: 'Nicholas Stewart 
QC, sitting as The Appeals Committee, has considered the submissions 
made by all parties in the final part of Stephen Lee's appeal against 
his finding that he was in breach of the WPBSA Rules for match and spot 
fixing in connection with seven matches in 2008-9.

'The appeal was against the finding, and the costs order imposed by Adam Lewis QC in September 2013.

'Today
 Mr Stewart has delivered his decision and he has dismissed the appeal. 
In addition he has increased the costs order in relation to the hearing 
before Adam Lewis QC from £40,000 to £75,000.

'The
 term of the suspension remains at a period of twelve years. This means 
that Stephen Lee will continue to be unable to compete in professional 
snooker before 12th October 2024.

'The costs in relation to the appeal hearing on Monday are yet to be determined.'
