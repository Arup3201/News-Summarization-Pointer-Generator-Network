Arsenal's exit from the Champions League last 16 for the fifth consecutive season on Tuesday has once again exposed the limitations of Arsene Wenger's unbalanced squad.

The Gunners came close to making Champions League history by becoming the first team to reverse a two-goal deficit from home but fell just short in their 2-0 victory at the Stade Louis II.

Here, Sportsmail identifies nine players in three key areas - goalkeeper, defensive midfielder and centre forward - that could transform the north London side from fading challengers to serious title contenders...

Read how Arsene Wenger has gone almost two decades in the Champions League without winning the prize with Arsenal 

GOALKEEPERS

PETR CECH

Chelsea

Cost: £20m

Jose Mourinho says it will cost 'huge money' for Cech who at 32 is still reliable and a calming influence. The £20m price tag is too high and you get the impression for any other club Cech would cost less. 

The figures and Cech's age will act as a deterrent for the normally cash-conscious Arsene Wenger. However, if Cech's experience prevented Champions League quarter-final, first-leg displays such as the one against Monaco it's a deal worth considering.

BERND LENO

Bayer Leverkusen

Cost: £12m

Arsenal have a keen interest in the 23-year-old German Under 21 international. He already has good experience despite his age, having made his Champions League debut against Chelsea in 2011 at 19.

Arsenal scouts watching his team-mate Lars Bender have been impressed and Leno is interested in a move. His contract runs to 2018 but he said: 'The foreign option is certainly appealing. A new language, a new culture - that I could definitely even imagine.'

MATTIA PERIN

Genoa

Cost: £16m

Arsenal have pondered the experience of Real Madrid's Iker Casillas, the promise of Mainz's Loris Karius but Mattia Perin at Genoa keeps cropping up on their scouting lists. He is 22 and tipped to become the new Gianluigi Buffon but Arsenal have watched him for three years now. 

Liverpool have also considered him as have Inter Milan. Another option with Premier League experience and at a similar price who has been discussed is Asmir Begovic of Stoke City.

DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDERS

LARS BENDER

Bayer Leverkusen

Cost: £22m

Arsenal have considered moves for Bender over the past few seasons and his injury record plus Leverkusen's reluctance to deal has stalled discussions. This season has been one of his best however and he is back in their thinking. 

Only problem is he is now also on the lists of Manchester United and Barcelona, who want him when their transfer ban is lifted next January. A stylish and strong player who could add much-needed discipline to the squad.

MORGAN SCHNEIDERLIN

Southampton

Cost: £30m

The favoured choice of Arsene Wenger, Schneiderlin is expected to be the subject of an early summer bid from Arsenal. Southampton want him to stay but have already earmarked certain players to replace him should he go. 

Tottenham, Manchester United and Liverpool have also looked at the 25-year-old France international, who is one of the league's best midfielders. Mauricio Pochettino could prove an obstacle but Champions League qualification may be the key.

JAMES McCARTHY

Everton

Cost: £30m

Everton do not wish to sell but McCarthy is a player Arsenal like a lot. Tottenham's head of recruitment Paul Mitchell also has the Republic of Ireland international high on his wishlist and the north London neighbours will test Everton's resolve as they formalise summer plans. 

McCarthy is still only 24 but has plenty of experience at domestic and international level. Highly regarded by his team-mates and coaches alike, he can also play a more advanced role if required.

James McCarthy is an unexpected name who could shore up the centre of Arsenal's midfield

CENTRE FORWARDS

MARIO MANDZUKIC

Atletico Madrid

Cost: £20m

Aggressive, skilful and a goalscorer. Mandzukic is a handful on and off the pitch but he would give Arsenal the edge they lack. He fell out with Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich and his relationship with Diego Simeone is now said to be strained.

His representatives have already sounded out Premier League clubs and he seems intent on a move to England. Wenger wanted him last summer but the Croat was keen to replace Diego Costa at Atletico.

ALEXANDRE LACAZETTE

Lyon

Cost: £25m

Cash-strapped Lyon are doing their best to hike up the price of their star striker and he seems intent on leaving with Manchester City and Liverpool also among clubs to have checked on him this season. 

He has 26 goals in 28 games despite a run of just two in his last four. Still only 23, Lacazette can play off either wing and act as a foil to a big target man. Fits Arsenal's style and life with Wenger would be a big pull for the ambitious Frenchman.

EDINSON CAVANI

Paris Saint-Germain

Cost: £35m

Cavani has been looking for a move away from Paris for the past year. His representatives held talks with Manchester United last year and he was keen to join prior to David Moyes departing. He split from his agent and is now looked after by his brother. 

All the Premier League big guns have been contacted and Arsenal are interested although the cost and wages would be high. Other options exist such as Palermo's Paulo Dybala but he is keen to stay in Italy.
