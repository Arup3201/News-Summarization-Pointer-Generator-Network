She has been socializing with royalty and celebrities as she makes her foray back into the spotlight - after admitting she was 'the most humiliated woman in the world'

But after being spotted at celeb hot spot Little House in London's Mayfair last night, Monica Lewinsky may want to lay low - as Hillary Clinton is heading into town, MailOnline can reveal.

The potential Presidential candidate and one-time Lewinsky nemesis is currently en route to London to publicize her new book, Hard Choices.

Moving on: Monica Lewinsky has made a decision to stop laying low and 'It's time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress'

Sitting pretty: Lewinsky says she decided to 'stick her head above the parapet' and come out of her self-imposed exile

And Mrs Clinton certainly means business as BBC broadcaster Jeremy Vine today announced she would be spending the entirety of his BBC Radio 2 lunchtime show in the studio with him tomorrow. She will also be interviewed on Radio 4's Woman's Hour.

Mrs Clinton, 66, seemed excited by her visit as shortly before taking off to the UK early this morning she tweeted a photo of herself signing copies of Hard Choices at Hudson News at New York's JFK airport.

She wrote: 'Stopped by @HudsonBooks at JFK before my flight to London. We're taking the #HardChoices book tour across the pond!'

Meanwhile, MailOnline can reveal Monica, now 40, the former White House intern infamous for her liaison with President Bill Clinton, was seen looking slender and stylish at the trendy Soho House off-shoot in the capital last night.

The club is a members-only spot and means that Monica would have had to be invited by one of the high-profile members.

After 10 
years of self-imposed exile, Monica has made it clear she's back - and wants to move beyond her affair with President Clinton.

She cut a slim figure at the Masterpiece Marie Curie party at the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London on Monday night.

She mingled with Princess Beatrice and guests including actor Clive Owen and model Yasmin Le Bon at the event to benefit the Marie Curie Cancer Care charity,  which provides home nurses to people with terminal cancer.

Breaking her silence in a revealing Vanity Fair article recently, she wrote: 'It’s time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress.

'I, myself, deeply regret what happened between me and President Clinton. Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened.'

And as part of her return to the public eye, Monica calls herself 'the most humiliated woman in the world' in a new National Geographic documentary, 'The 90s: The Last Great Decade?', which will air starting next Sunday.

On Tuesday, the Today show gave a first glimpse at the three-part special, in which Monica opens up about the day a 445-page report by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr was published.

'That
 was one of the worst days of my life,' she said. 'I was a virgin to 
humiliation of that level, until that day... I was the most humiliated 
woman in the world.

When Page Six asked about Monica's stylish appearance in London this week, her spokeswoman responded, 'Her focus is on work right now.

'She was pleased to support the work of her dear friend Heather Kerzner and all she does for Marie Curie Cancer Care. Growing up the daughter of a radiation oncologist, Monica viewed Marie Curie as a hero.'

The timing of Monica's decision to return to the spotlight is interesting, as it coincides with the release of Hillary Clinton's memoir as speculation as to whether she will run in 2016 ramps up.

Monica says that after laying low when Mrs Clinton ran for office in 2008, she's 
unprepared to put her life on hold for another possibly eight to 10 
years.  

'I turned 40 last year, and it is time to stop tiptoeing around my past—and other people’s futures. I am determined to have a different ending to my story.'

Meanwhile, Mrs Clinton says she has 'moved on' from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and wants everyone else to do the same.

The former Secretary of State also revealed she did read the essay that Monica wrote for last month's Vanity Fair magazine that focuses on the scandal that dominated.

In an interview for People magazine in early June, Mrs Clinton said: 'I think everybody needs to look to the future.'

However, Republicans have signaled they don't consider her husband's scandal from the late 1990s out of bounds in the realm of 2016-style political dialogue.

Life-altering: Lewinsky was just 22 when she and then-President Bill Clinton began an affair that would deeply affect both of their futures

Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, a likely GOP presidential contender, answered criticisms of the Republican record on women's issues by saying in January that the last Democratic president engaged in 'predatory behavior' with a woman, Lewinsky, who was 22 when her liaisons with Clinton began in 1995.

Mrs Clinton also refused to confirm or deny calling her a 'narcissistic looney toon' after the affair became public.

Monica says she wants to use her experiences to help others facing public humiliation, citing the tragic death of Tyler Clementi, who killed himself after he was streamed via webcam kissing another man and was ridiculed on social media.

'Perhaps by sharing my story, I reasoned, I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation. The question became: How do I find and give a purpose to my past?' she wrote.

'My current goal is to get involved with efforts on behalf of victims of online humiliation and harassment and to start speaking on this topic in public forums.'
