An annual list of the richest lawmakers in the U.S. Congress was released today and taking the number one spot is Representative Darrell Issa of California.

The Republican earned his estimated $355.4 million through his Viper car alarm company—ironically, since he's been accused by opponents of having himself been a car thief in his youth—and represents the Golden State’s 49th district.

Though Issa is identifiable by many for his visible opposition to President Obama, he’s surprisingly less well known than some of his colleagues on the list of Congress’s least wealthy members.

Stand back from the congressman: Viper Car alarm mogul and California Congressman Darrell Issa is the richest congressperson with a worth of around $355 million

Hillary Clinton’s return to private life helped Issa become the richest federal lawmaker by virtue of culling John Kerry away from the senate and into the White House cabinet. Kerry, whose wife inherited a healthy chunk of the Heinz ketchup fortune, was often at the top of the list released annually by Washington congressional newspaper The Hill.

Now Issa has more money than anyone else in Congress. He’s also chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, a job that often pits him against the Democratic president.

Each year, Washington congressional newspaper The Hill releases the top 50 wealthiest House representatives and Senators. Topping the list was California congressman Darrell Issa, whose Viper car alarm company, well known for their television commercials and talking warnings, led him to become a self-made millionaire. Here's the worth of the richest 10 of the richest 50:

Saucy: Former Senator John Kerry once held the title thanks to wife Teresa Heinz's ketchup fortune

It should be noted, however, that while Issa has served as a Congressman under President Obama, his personal wealth has more than doubled.

The Ohio native, though a watchdog of the president, has for years taken heat for unproven accusations that he actually stole cars, instead of protecting them, in the 1970s.

Just behind Issa, in the number two spot, is the man who held the title of number one richest Congressman—Republican Representative from Texas Michael McCaul.

McCaul, who oversees the Homeland Security Committee, is worth an estimated $101.9 million thanks to his wife’s family business—Clear Channel Communications.

At the opposite end of the spectrum are 
Congress’s least wealthy members, some of whom are often cited as 2016 
presidential contenders according to The Washington Post.

The other half: With the wealthiest lawmakers must come the least wealthy. Among them are Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky (right, with $455,000) and Kirsten Gillibrand (left, with $166,000)

Sweating it: Likely 2016 presidential contender Senator Marco Rubio of Florida actually has a negative net worth of $190,000

Likely presidential candidate and Kentucky Republican Rand Paul, the Tea Party darling son of two-time presidential also-ran Ron Paul, clocks in with the relatively paltry worth of about $455,000.

New York’s Senator Kristen Gillibrand, whose name is also sometimes batted around in the 2016 echo chamber, is worth even less with assets roughly totaling $166,000.

And finally, Marco Rubio, another name synonymous with 2016 White House hopes, is actually well in the red. The Senator from Florida is worth negative $190,000.
