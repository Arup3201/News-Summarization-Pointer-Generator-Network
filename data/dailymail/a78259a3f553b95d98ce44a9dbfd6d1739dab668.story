It’s no secret that most young boys are fascinated by trains.

But for one young train enthusiast the fascination became all the more pronounced when he witnessed his father operating a locomotive for the first time.

Sat on his mother’s lap in Buffalo, New York, the young boy waits in anticipation for the oncoming train, which sounds its horn.

As the train comes into view the mother waves at the cabin and the camera pans around to capture it.

Tooting the horn, the father can be seen waving from the window of the train as it drives past pulling numerous carriages carrying freight.

Showing the young boy again, the camera picks up his immediate reaction to spotting his father at the controls.

Shaking with delight, the youngster laughs ecstatically as his mother looks down at him and smiles proudly.

The young boy watches as the rest of the train drives past and is seemingly lost for words.

According to the family, the father, a Norfolk Southern Engineer, was driving the train en route to Binghamton via Southern Tier Line.

Upon seeing his father at the controls of the train, the young boy is ecstatic and laughs in hysterics  

While the youngster has seen his dad on board several trains before this is apparently the first time he came to understand that he drove them.

The Norfolk Southern Railway is a Class I railroad owned by the Norfolk Southern Corporation in America.

It operates over 22,000 route miles in 22 eastern states, and the most common commodity transported on its railroad is coal.
