When it comes time for the last hurrah for brides- and grooms-to-be, hens prefer to let loose in Spanish party hotspots while men would rather go wild in European cities famous for strippers and prostitutes.

A poll of hens and stags has found that the top three destinations for women on their hen do are Marbella, Barcelona and Majorca.

The Spanish destinations are known party hotspots but are more renowned for boozing than the no-holds barred sexual thrills that men appear to be seeking.

According to the survey, men prefer to get up to no good in Prague, Riga and Amsterdam, three cities with well-known sex industries.

Prostitution is legal in Prague and a BBC Three documentary last year suggested that one in two men sleep with a prostitute during a stag do in the capital of the Czech Republic.

The second most popular spot for men is Riga, the Latvian capital that has a reputation for erotic massages and lap-dancing clubs.

Amsterdam, famous for its Red Light District, is the third most popular destination for a stag party.

The poll commissioned by Red7, which organises hen and stag dos, found that the top destinations in the UK are Brighton, London and Edinburgh.

Viki Sanders, of Red7, said stags and hens were increasingly travelling even further around the globe for the ‘perfect send-off’.

She said: ‘Many brides- and grooms-to-be travel a considerable distance for their perfect hen or stag do.’
