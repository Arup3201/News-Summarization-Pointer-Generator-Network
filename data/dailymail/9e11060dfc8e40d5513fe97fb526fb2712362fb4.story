The United Arab Emirates pulled out of coalition airstrikes against ISIS after the capture of a Jordanian pilot who has since been murdered by the extremists, it has been reported.

The key U.S. ally is said to have suspended its role in December after Lt Moaz al-Kasasbeh was shot down over Syria amid fears for the fate of its own pilots.

Among them is the symbolically important Major Mariam Al Mansouri, the country's first female pilot who became the poster girl for the bombing missions when they started last year.

Her participation in F-16 airstrikes has been celebrated in the West and even led to her missions being dubbed 'boobs on the ground'.

The UAE said it wants the U.S. to improve its search-and-rescue efforts, including the use of V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, in northern Iraq, closer to the battleground.

As it stands, the U.S.-led mission is based in Kuwait, administration officials said, according to the New York Times.

The paper said UAE pilots will not rejoin the fight until the Ospreys - which take off and land like helicopters but fly like planes - are deployed in northern Iraq.

Lt al-Kasasbeh was captured by Islamic State militants within minutes of his plane crashing in December near Raqqa, Syria, the Times said, quoting a senior U.S. military official.

But UAE officials questioned if American military rescue teams would have been able to reach the pilot even if there had been more time for a rescue effort, administration officials said.

The UAE foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, asked Barbara Leaf, the new US ambassador, why the United States had not put proper resources in northern Iraq for rescuing downed pilots, a senior administration official said.

The UAE declined comment.

'We cannot comment on issues discussed in private meetings,' an official source said in Abu Dhabi after the publication of the Times article.

Major Mansouri, from Abu Dhabi, made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air force. 

She joined it in 2007 and is now a squadron commander.

She is one of eight children and has a degree in English literature.

The UAE is known to have the most liberal views on women's rights in the Middle East and Mansouri said that she was treated as an equal by her commanding officers.

She told Deraa Al Watan magazine: 'Everybody is required to have the same high level of combat competence.' 

While her participation in the airstrikes was praised by the West, her family reportedly disowned her and labelled her an 'ingrate' for 'taking part in the brutal international aggression' against Syria. 

After video was released yesterday showing Lt al-Kasasbeh being torched to death, condemnations quickly came from Gulf Arab nations, all of which are close U.S. allies.

The foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, condemned the killing and reaffirmed his nation's commitment to fighting terrorism and extremism. 

'This heinous and obscene act represents a brutal escalation by the terrorist group, whose evil objectives have become apparent,' he said.

The UAE is one of the most visible Arab members in the U.S.-led coalition battling the Islamic State group, which also includes Jordan. 

Bahrain, a Gulf state that is home to the U.S. 5th Fleet, denounced the killing as 'despicable,' and Kuwait's emir, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, blasted the killing as 'criminal' and 'vicious.'

Qatar's Foreign Ministry also condemned the 'criminal act contravening the tolerant principles of the Islamic faith, human values and international laws and norms.' 

The tiny but very rich Gulf nation hosts the regional command center co-ordinating coalition airstrikes. 

These images purportedly show the exact location where the Jordanian pilot was burned alive by the Islamic State in the Syrian city of Raqqa.

Respected anti-ISIS activists Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently (RIBSS) claim to have pinpointed the area by cross-referencing landmarks in yesterday's execution video with aerial photographs.

Using a series of annotated graphics, the group argues the barbaric murder took place in a compound in the far south of the city, a few hundred metres from the Euphrates River.

If proven correct, they could help coalition forces more accurately target bombing runs and surveillance operations in its attempt to root out the jihadist executioners.

However, MailOnline has been unable to independently verify the images.

The sickening video footage, released by ISIS yesterday, shows Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh being torched to death after he was captured when his F-16 fighter jet crashed over the city.

This third image shows the captive standing inside the courtyard in front of the cage which he is later locked into and torched to death. The picture also shows a wall in the background which, the group claims, confirms the location of the compound

Location? RIBSS argues the barbaric murder took place  in the far south of Raqqa, a few hundred metres from the Euphrates River

As with previous beheading videos featuring British executioner Jihadi John, the 20-minute-long clip is characterised by its slick production values and graphics.

But crucially it contains an added cinematic dimension, with wider landscape shots and aerial footage, that offers much more detailed views of the landscape than before.

RIBSS now claims to have exploited this to create a detail picture of where the various parts of the video were shot.
