An 89-year-old woman who had lived in the same California home for decades vanished for four years - and was found living in a filthy shack on the other side of the country.

Sarah Cheiker had lived in the Fairfax district of Los Angeles for more than 35 years - first with her mother, then later by herself - but vanished without a trace in 2008. 

Concerned next-door neighbor Jim Caccavo alerted the authorities after demolition crews showed up to destroy her house. 'I was shocked. We figured she was dead,' he said.

But there was no word of Ms Cheiker until she was found in Egdecomb, halfway up the Maine coastline - a distance of more than 3,000 miles - in 2012.

Authorities in Maine were tipped off about the remote location of Ms Cheiker, who had no known friends or family at the time of her disappearance, reported the LA Times.

She was found in a desolate hut with a single lightbulb, surrounded by rotting food, in temperatures of more than 100 degrees. She appeared to have been living on just fast food and oranges.

Jerry Pike, manager of Pine Crest Motor Court, where the hut was based, said at the time of her discovery: 'I can't imagine a gerbil being left alone in that cabin, much less an old lady.'

Ms Cheiker was taken to Miles Memorial Hospital and, despite her ordeal, later made a full recovery, according to the Lincoln County News.

Meanwhile in LA, a new house had sprung up on the site of her old residence, which records show was bought by a developer for $712,000.

Authorities investigating what could have moved a vulnerable old woman the entire breadth of the country, and left her in such dire circumstances, learned of three new people who had come into her life shortly before she vanished.

Suspects: Nicholas (right, in his mugshot) and Barbara Davis (left) - 41-year-old twins - and their godson Jonathan Stevens, 21, befriended Cheiker after knocking on her door at random one day, prosecutors said

The twins' godson: According to neighbors, the trio looked after her by taking her to doctor's appointments and the store - and even let her move in after fire damaged her house. Above Stevens in his mugshot

Nicholas and Barbara Davis - 41-year-old twins - and their godson Jonathan Stevens, 21, befriended Ms Cheiker after knocking on her door at random one day, prosecutors said.

According to neighbors, they looked after her by taking her to doctor's appointments and the store - and even let her move in after fire damaged her house.

After Ms Cheiker vanished in 2008, a living trust in her name sold the rebuilt house for $712,000, according to property records. Authorities said Ms Cheiker was taken from LA by the trio, who then dragged her on a financially ruinous jaunt across the nation, before leaving her in the shack.

The three were charged with endangering the welfare of a dependent person - but pleaded no contest in court so were never found guilty. They are now on probation.

Investigators believe the trio assumed Ms Cheiker would die in the cabin - and that they would never be caught.

An attorney for Lincoln County in Maine, who prosecuted the case, told the Times: 'They purchased numerous properties across the country with her money.

'I've seen things that were egregious, but I'd never seen a person taken across the country, stripped of their assets and left to die.'

Ms Cheiker was taken into the care of Maine authorities after they found her, and she now lives in a nursing home in the state.

By the time the court case ran its course, all that was left from the trio was $7,000, which was restored to Cheiker.

However, attorneys for the alleged exploiters claim they have done nothing wrong - and that they aren't able to clear their name because they're unable to subpoena Ms Cheiker because authorities won't say where she is.

A defense attorney said: 'They were checking on her and bringing her food every day. She was like part of the family... she didn't like the noise from a lot of company visiting them that summer so they put her up in a seasonal rental cabin.

'Somebody called the local authorities: It was the nosy-neighbor syndrome.'
