Parents who lose children in tragic accidents may be able to clone replacements within the next 50 years, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist has claimed

Sir John Gurdon, the British scientist whose work cloning frogs in the 1950s and 60s led to the creation of Dolly the sheep by Edinburgh scientists in 1996, said human cloning could happen within half a century.

The biologist who won this year’s Nobel prize thinks that while any attempt to clone a human would raise complex ethical issues, people would soon overcome their concerns if the technique became medically useful.

Dolly the Sheep was the first of several mammals to be cloned, including Cc the kitten

He explained that in-vitro fertilisation was regarded with considerable suspicion when it was first developed but became widely accepted after the birth of Louise Brown, the first ‘test tube baby’, in 1978.

However, the vast majority of animal embryos cloned today are deformed so major improvements in cloning methods would have to be made, he added.

Speaking on BBC Radio Four’s The Life Scientific, the biologist said he had predicted at the time of his frog experiments that the successful cloning of a mammal would happen within 50 years, and that and that the same answer could be applied to human cloning today.

He said: ‘When my first frog 
experiments were done an eminent American reporter came down and said 
“How long will it be before these things can be done in mammals or 
humans?”

‘I said: “Well, it 
could be anywhere between 10 years and 100 years – how about 50 years?” 
It turned out that wasn’t far off the mark as far as Dolly was 
concerned. Maybe the same answer is appropriate.’

Sir John Gurdon, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in October, says human cloning could happen within 50 years

The
79-year-old former Etonian added that cloning a human effectively means
making an identical twin, and doctors would therefore simply be 
‘copying what nature has already produced’.

‘I take the view that anything you can do to relieve suffering or improve human health will usually be widely accepted by the public – that is to say if cloning actually turned out to be solving some problems and was useful to people, I think it would be accepted,’ he said.

During his public lectures - which include speeches at Oxford and Cambridge Universities - he often asks his audience if they would be in favour of allowing parents of deceased children, who are no longer fertile, to create another using the mother’s eggs and skin cells from the first child, assuming the technique was safe and effective.

‘The average vote on that is 60 per cent in favour,’ he said.

‘The reasons for “no” are usually that the new child would feel they were some sort of a replacement for something and not valid in their own right.

‘But if the mother and father, if relevant, want to follow that route, why should you or I stop them?’

Almost 35 years ago, ethical questions were raised over test-tube babies, but since the birth of Louise Brown in 1978 the process of in vitro fertilisation has become commonplace, and is used by thousands of infertile couples around the world.
