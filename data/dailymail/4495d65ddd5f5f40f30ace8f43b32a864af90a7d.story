More than 60 per cent of people put on weight when they are in a comfortable relationship, new research suggests.

Some 62 per cent of people admit gaining up to a stone since being in a relationship, while 72 per cent also think their partner has put on weight.

This is little surprise as 52 per cent of women say they often eat the same amount as their male partner, and 56 per cent admit this means they eat much larger portions than they would normally.

The research, commissioned by Diet Chef, also revealed that 66 per cent of couples think they have put on weight together.

This makes being in a relationship the most common cause of weight gain, beating comfort eating, lack of exercise, and holidays.

The reasons for this are clear – 30 per cent of couples say that their main activity together is staying in and watching television, while 20 per cent state eating out together as a key bonding activity.

However, these statistics are not the most disturbing.

Some 40 per cent of Britons admit to burping in front of their partner, while 26 per cent say they are happy to pass wind in their long-suffering partner’s company.

It seems that gaining weight is not the only way in which people let themselves go when they are settled in a relationship.

The survey found that 26 per cent of people shave their legs and other body hair less once they feel comfortable with their partner.

However, all is not lost as the survey also revealed that 26 per cent of people wish that they had a healthier lifestyle with their partner.

Izzy Cameron, Nutrition and Weight Management Specialist at Diet Chef said: ‘This survey has revealed some very interesting results, and it’s surprising to see how complacent people can be when they are in a relationship.

‘It’s widely known that people tend to put on a little bit of weight once they have found love, but what we didn't expect to find was that the weight gain is on average a stone, if not more.

‘At Diet Chef we appreciate the role food plays in a relationship, and whilst enjoyment of food is great, it’s important to stay healthy and monitor what you eat on a daily basis, especially portion size.’
