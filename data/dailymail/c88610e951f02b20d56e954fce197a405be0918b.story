Julia Gillard's ex-partner and former head of the AWU, Bruce Wilson, has been photographed punching a photographer outside a union corruption hearing today.

AAP photographer Dan Himbrechts captured footage of the former AWU boss grabbing News Limited photographer Sam Mooy's jacket and punching him in the face.

It also shows pedestrians looking visibly surprised by the altercation which occurred in the middle of Sydney's CBD about 1.30pm

Look out! Photographer Dan Himbrechts captured the moment that former AWU boss Bruce Wilson accosted a photographer outside a hearing in Sydney

Mr Himbrechts told MailOnline: 'We noticed him across the road having a meeting with a woman and kept an eye on him,' the AAP photographer said.

After waiting a while, the pair crossed to get a photograph of the man who is accused of embezzling funds from the AWU for personal purposes - including to buy a house in Melbourne.

'I was a few metres back when Sam was firing off a few shots of him (Wilson)' Himbrechts said.

Come here, boy! Bruce Wilson attacks photographer Sam Mooy outside a Sydney hearing today. an inquiry is being held into allegations of corruption at the union he was once the boss of

'I waited for him to turn around, but he just lunged and attacked Sam making contact with his lens and face.'

'It was over very quickly.'

Mr Himbrechts said he thought heard an expletive come from Wilson's mouth, but couldn't be sure.

Mr Wilson wasn't even due to appear at day one of the hearing into allegations of AWU corruption, which is investigating allegations that a slush-fund was set up to pay kick-backs to union members.

It was a scandal which dogged much of Ms Gillard's reign as Prime Minister, because she was Mr Wilson's partner when the allegations took place more than 20 years ago.

Ms Gillard was also working for law firm Slater and Gordon at the time of the alleged rort of funds, and she provided her partner with pro-bono legal services for the establishment of the fund which paid for a Fitzroy property.

Police are aware of the incident but a spokesman said no one has come forward with a formal complaint.

The spokesman said: 'Sydney city (command) are aware of the incident, but no complaint has been forwarded.'
