Players and fans of New Zealand and Sri Lanka were treated to an impromptu streaker during their ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 opener.

New Zealand cruised to victory over their opponents but not before a brief interruption at the Hagley Oval as the streaker got his five minutes of fame.

Fitness starts to become cruical as the stewards slowly get to grips with the naked frolicker 

The rather unsightly specimen gave stewards in Christchurch the runaround as he continued to avoid their attempted blockades.

His pursuit was greeted by cheers and laughter as he galloped around the field.

The nude man was eventually caught as his sheer lack of fitness and agility started to show.

New Zealand went on to record a comfortable victory as Corey Anderson starred in a 98-run win.

Security make sure the naked man can't escape as they escort him off the field of play
