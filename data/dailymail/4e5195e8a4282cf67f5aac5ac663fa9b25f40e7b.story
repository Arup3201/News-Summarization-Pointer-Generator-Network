Steven Naismith has revealed Samuel Eto’o’s arrival has been key to his development and helped him become Everton’s most improved player.

The Scotland international has thrived since Roberto Martinez has been at Goodison Park and he produced another accomplished display against Lille on Thursday, scoring the final goal in a 3-0 win.

Naismith has been on a hot streak in this campaign – that was his fifth in 12 appearances – but his all-round play has been just as striking as his goal scoring and he puts that down to being able to play and train alongside Eto’o.

Former Rangers man Steven Naismith has already scored five goals in 12 appearances for Everton this season

Naismith said being able to watch Samuel Eto'o in training has been a huge boost to his development 

Goal 1: Scored in 2-2 draw with Leicester

Goal 2: Scored in 2-2 draw with Arsenal

Goal 3: Scored in 6-3 defeat by Chelsea

Goal 4: Scored in 2-1 defeat by Man Utd

Goal 5: Scored in 3-0 win against Lille

Eto’o has made a big impression on Everton’s squad, most notably with how he approaches training every day, and Naismith says he and Romelu Lukaku are certainly feeling the benefits.

Naismith said: ‘The two of them work closely in training and so every day he is seeing him, the way he moves, and seeing where he takes his touches and it is definitely going to help him.

It is not as if they go and do specific things together, it is just general, off – the – cuff stuff that Samuel does that Rom will be catching onto and hopefully taking into his game.

‘But without a doubt it does help watching someone like Samuel. It’s not like you are sitting down chatting to him and analysing the whole way he has played throughout his career.

‘It’s just watching what they do on a day-to-day basis. There might be some sessions when Samuel is scoring a lot of goals, so you are picking up on how he is getting into the positions to score those goals.

Naismith was signed by David Moyes but has really flourished since Roberto Martinez took charge at Goodison

Naismith said that £28million summer signing Romelu Lukaku also feels the benefit of training with Eto'o

‘Watching him is definitely helping me and with Big Duncan (Ferguson) helping with the squad as well giving you pointers we have great people around us that are going to make us better players.’

Naismith took time to find his feet after he arrived as a free agent in June 2012 but he has not looked back since Martinez arrived. He has 19 months left on his current contract and it is highly likely he will stay beyond that.

Martinez said: 'I love watching Steven play. I think the way he is adapting in different positions, even during games, he has an incredible intelligence. The football intelligence that he has is quite refreshing and important in our squad.

‘But it is important we keep focusing on the games and as I say behind the scenes we always keep an eye on every individual situation.’
