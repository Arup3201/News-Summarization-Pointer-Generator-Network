Winning away from home to break an 11-match losing sequence and out of the bottom three, perhaps QPR owner Tony Fernandes has found his ‘dream manager’ after all.

The Loftus Road chief tweeted before the game that his ‘dream’ boss – thought to be Michael Laudrup - was lined up to replace Harry Redknapp, who quit last week having failed to take a single point on the road this season.

But Fernandes could well be having a rethink after caretaker Chris Ramsey steered the R’s to their first away triumph in the Premier League in nearly two years.

It is, of course, almost certain that he will return to his role as academy chief. But this win – achieved thanks to goals from Leroy Fer and Bobby Zamora and a save-of-the-season contender from Robert Green – was as impressive as it was surprising.

And Ramsey said: ‘I thought I deserved the job even before this!

‘This would be some way to go out though. I’m sure I’ll still be involved in some way in developing the club. I’m also academy manager and I’ve got plenty of work on my hands.

‘But I will carry on in this role until told otherwise.’

Ramsey and his team were just arriving at the Stadium of Light when Fernandes, who has ruled out Tim Sherwood for the job, tweeted: ‘Think I have got my dream manager. Not what everyone thinks. Takes a while. Still a bit to go but I’m very happy. Press all wrong.’

Favourite Laudrup, however, is currently in charge of Qatar side Lekhwiya and it won’t be easy to release the former Swansea manager from his contract.

Should that prove the case then Ramsey could be set for an extended stay in the role.

He made six changes – including a recall for Rio Ferdinand – and saw his side boss the first half to lead 2-0 at the break.

Fer headed a stylish 17th-minute opener from Matt Phillips’s inviting centre and cracked the post soon after.

Within 60 seconds of that miss the hosts had the chance to draw level, Jermain Defoe lifting above Green and the crossbar after escaping Stephen Caulker inside the six–yard area.

Then came Green’s stupendous save. Adam Johnson loaded a cross from the right, Connor Wickham peeled free and planted a header on goal from point-blank range. Goal! Or so we thought. Green had other ideas, instinctively diverting the ball onto the bar before spinning and shovelling clear as it bounced on the line.

Green’s stop was barely believable and by half-time Rangers were in dreamland. Phillips again swept over from the right and Zamora applied an emphatic finish from 12 yards.

Ramsey said: ‘I’m sure it’s not just my magic wand – the players have to take a lot of credit.

‘We didn’t over-celebrate at the end because we’re capable of playing like that. I know there was speculation before the game but we tried to keep ourselves focussed.

‘It was important to win to stay close to teams in that area and it’s given us great belief.’

Gus Poyet, meanwhile, was from pleased with Sunderland’s lacklustre performance, leaving them just two points above the drop zone.

He said: ‘You cannot start like that at home in such an important game.

‘It’s a massive missed opportunity to go clear of the bottom three. When we are in a good situation we always seem to take a step back – it happens too often, we need to change that.’
