Pictures of the helicopter crash scene where two British tourists and their guide were killed during a fishing trip to Russia today emerged.

Retired top corporate lawyer Rupert Beaumont and fine art dealer Mark Robertson were hit by the spinning rotor blades moments after stepping off the aircraft.

Investigators today began quizzing the pilot as a criminal case was been opened into the horror.

Wreckage: Debris litters the site where this helicopter crashed, killing two British tourists and their guide

Investigation: The rotor blades are clearly missing from the Eurocopter EC-120 which crashed while taking two Britons and a guide on a luxury fishing trip to a remote part of Russia

There are claims he initially misled 
police on the circumstances of the crash which killed the three men on a
VIP Arctic salmon fishing trip.

The probe is understood to be focusing on whether pilot error, rather than mechanical malfunction, may be the cause of the tragedy.

Tribute: Rupert Beaumont, pictured, was described as a devoted family man who was deeply admired within the legal profession

The British men - both of whom were aged 69 and from Hampshire - died instantly after being struck by the blades, say Russian sources.

First pictures from the scene show the damaged helicopter near a remote river in the Kola Peninsula - with its blades detached.

The Eurocopter E120B is shown lurched 
to one side, supporting one theory that after landing one wheel sank 
into a water-logged ground, making the helicopter lurch, striking the 
men on the ground.

'They had no chance,' said a Russian source.

The Russian guide was named as Alexander Tushnikov, a specialist in fishing trips to the Arctic north of Russia.

Pilot Alexander Shabalin - who had 25 
years flying experience - survived the tragedy and made a distress call 
to alert the authorities.

Christopher Saul, a partner at Slaughter and May, today paid tribute to his friend and former colleague Mr Beaumont, who retired as a senior partner in the law firm in 2001.

He said: 'This is the most tragic news.

'Rupert
was with the firm for over thirty years and built a hugely successful 
practice.

'He was admired by colleagues and clients alike for his 
wonderful legal skills, his creativity, his grace under pressure and his
warmth and charm.

'He will be enormously missed and our hearts go out to his family.'

Mr Beaumont's wife was on holiday in Australia when she received news of the tragedy.

Impact: The helicopter flipped moments after dropping off Mark Robertson and Rupert Beaumont and their guide for a fishing trip, initial reports suggest

Emergency: The pilot of the stricken helicopter managed to escape the wreckage with only minor injuries

Probe: An investigation is now underway to establish how the Eurocopter EC-120, which has a good safety record, crashed, killing three

Investigative sources are already 
pointing to pilot error over the three deaths. Another source spoke of 
the 'human factor' in the deaths.

The pilot is being probed under an article in
the Russian criminal code on the violation of air safety rules leading 
to the death of  two or more people, which carries a penalty of between 
four and ten years in jail.

Accounts were muddled from different 
Russian agencies yesterday but the country's aviation agency Rosaviatsia
said the helicopter 'tilted and fell onto its side'.

The Russian Investigative Committee 
-equivalent of the FBI - on Sunday opened a formal review of the 
accident and a full-scale criminal probe is now underway.

In London, a Foreign Office spokesman 
said: 'We are aware of reports of the deaths of two British nationals in
Russia. We are in touch with the local authorities and stand ready to 
provide consular assistance.'

'The foreign tourists were staying in a luxury camp for fishing,' a security source told the Interfax news agency.

Russia’s 
Investigative Committee said in a statement: ‘After landing, the 
helicopter turned on its side and its rotors hit the passengers.’

The end of the Cold War opened new fishing grounds to wealthy angling enthusiasts.

The
Kola Peninsula was previously a top secret area, home to the Red 
October submarine base and the Soviet navy’s northern fleet.

Now
it is known as the ultimate destination for high-end fishing tours for 
Atlantic salmon, attracting anglers from around the world.

More
than 100 British anglers head to its lodges every week during the peak 
summer season, paying around £4,000 a week for custom fishing trips.

Ultimate destination: Salmon anglers on the 'untouched' Kola peninsula

They
are flown by helicopter to unspoilt rivers surrounded by Arctic 
wilderness because many fishing spots are inaccessible by road.

Operators
say the region has not been overfished like many popular salmon rivers 
and that competent anglers can catch more than 100 salmon in a week, 
with some fish weighing up to 40lb.

The peak season runs from June to August, when the area north of the Arctic Circle enjoys 24-hour daylight.

Outside the season, the rivers are frozen for three or four months a year.

The
two British men were said to be fishing on the Rynda, one of four 
rivers in the area where salmon forge upstream to breed from their ocean
feeding grounds.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the deaths of two British nationals in Russia.

‘We are in touch with the local authorities and we stand ready to provide consular assistance.’

Tragedy: The helicopter which is thought to have killed the three men was a Eurocopter 120B (stock image, this helicopter was not involved in the crash)

Justin
Maxwell Stuart runs a UK-based travel firm called Where Wise Men Fish 
and has organised tours to the Kola Peninsula in the past.

He
said: ‘It is some of the finest – if not the finest – salmon fishing on
the planet. Any dedicated salmon fly fisher would aspire to do this 
sort of trip.’

The Eurocopters are considered safer than the MI-2 ex-Russian military helicopters used elsewhere, Mr Maxwell Stuart said.

He
added: ‘They have better helicopters than in some places. The pilots 
are all very good. They are trained to drop people off under the arc of 
the blades to avoid things like this happening. It’s a real shock.’

Fly
fishing instructor Michael Evans has run trips to the region and said: 
‘It remains untouched because it is frozen for three to four months of 
the year. It’s a completely natural environment.

‘The fishing is phenomenal. It has the most prolific Atlantic salmon fishing in the world.’

Mr
Evans, who is based in Kent, said he had spent countless hours in 
helicopters since he first travelled there in 1994 and praised the 
standards and safety records.

Television
presenter Chris Tarrant visited the Kola peninsula in 2000 and later 
described being threatened by a drunk fishing inspector with a live 
revolver.
