Accused: Richard Husband, pictured, has appeared in court charged with causing the death of a paramedic and elderly patient in a crash on the A337 in Hampshire

A motorist has appeared in court charged with causing the death of a paramedic and elderly patient when their ambulance smashed into a tree.

It is claimed that Richard Husband, 26, collided with the emergency vehicle on the A337 Brockenhurst to Lyndhurst Road in Hampshire.

Ambulance driver Gillian Randall, 42, and 88-year-old patient Francis Ironside - who was travelling in the rear of the vehicle at the time of the crash - died at the scene.

A male crew member and a male relative of the patient also suffered serious back injuries in the collision.

Both had been travelling in the back of the ambulance at the time of the crash, on April 26 this year.

Husband, from Brockenhurst, Hants, is charged with two counts of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving.

He did not enter a plea at the short hearing held earlier today.

Magistrates in Southampton, Hampshire, have sent the case to trial at Bournemouth Crown Court on December 9.

Husband, who dressed in a sharp blue suit with a red and white striped tie, was granted unconditional bail.
