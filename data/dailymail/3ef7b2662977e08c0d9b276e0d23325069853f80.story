Toronto Mayor Rob Ford might be free of drugs and alcohol after two months in rehab, but it appears he still has at least one vice.

The politician ordered a staggering five espressos in one cup during a drive with Canadian DJ deadmau5, telling the stunned musician: 'It's good, trust me! I pound these espressos back.'

The bizarre interaction took place as the two men took a ride in the DJ's 2013 Ferrari 458 Spider F1 Edition, which is plastered with an animated cartoon cat called Nyan Cat.

The ride was part of deadmau5's ongoing online series called Coffee Run, in which he picks up a celebrity and they get coffee together. Their conversation is then uploaded, unedited, to YouTube.

deadmau5 had first reached out to Ford to be part of the show by tweeting at him in April, and on Monday, with Ford settled back to work following his visit to rehab, he picked him up from City Hall.

During the 30-minute clip, the two men cover a range of topics - peppered with plenty of expletives.

They chat about football, Toronto's pot holes, the city's new $4.5 million BMX track - which Ford brands a 'scam' - and how after work, he goes home, sees his kids and plays Risk.

And as they talk about how cell phones and eating behind the wheel make for dangerous drivers, Ford said he would not be making rules against them, explaining: 'I hate government intervention. Live and let live.'

'You're a mayor man!' deadmau5 says, shocked.

Eventually, they pull up to the window of a Jim Horton's, where Ford orders his five espressos. On hearing the hefty order, deadmau5 is incredulous.

'What does that equate to?' he asks, laughing. 'That's cardiac arrest... You know what that would do to me, dude?'

Ford, who gives him money to pay for the coffee, laughs and assures the DJ that 'it's good' and that it helps him stay up all night so that he can call his constituents.

Throughout the journey, deadmau5 expresses his shock at the amount of caffeine Ford must be drinking, while the mayor just laughs and double-checks he has been given enough.

Five espressos is more than 320mg of caffeine. Doctors deem 400mg a safe daily intake, according to the MayoClinic - meaning that if he really does 'pound' the drinks back, it's a cause for concern.

Back to work: Ford, pictured last week, returned to work last months after two months in rehab

Ford, 45, only returned to work a fortnight ago after spending two months at the Greenstone rehab centre in Bala, Ontario.

Ford admitted last year that he had smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor' following months of denials, and he checked into rehab when another video surfaced earlier this year.

By comparison, deadmau5 is staunchly anti-drugs and admitted that his only vice is computer games.

Previous celebrity guests on his show include actor Tom Green and singer-songwriter Pharrell Williams.
