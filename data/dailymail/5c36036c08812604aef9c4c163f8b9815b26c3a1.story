A Dallas hospital says it is isolating a patient who is showing signs of having the Ebola virus.

Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas said in a statement Monday night that the patient's symptoms and travel history suggest the patient may have Ebola, the virus that has killed more than 3,000 people across West Africa.

The hospital expects to receive preliminary test results Tuesday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Doctors said there should be a heightened sense of awareness around the outbreak in the Dallas area

Presbyterian Hospital says it's taking measures to keep its doctors, staff and patients safe.

CBS DFW reports that Dallas County Health and Human Services Director Zachary Thompson said the patient had definitely been in an area where the virus is present.

'Looking at the travel history is the first indicator and then the next step is [treatment or non-treatment] once we get the lab results,' he said.

He said there should be a heightened sense of awareness around the outbreak.

Doctors cautioned that unless there was transmission of blood, secretion or bodily fluids risk of infection was low

'We [health professionals] all had been planning to look at what our next
 steps are if there is a confirmed case,' he said. 'Again, we have to do the public
 health follow up, to see what contactsâ€¦ where this individual has gone 
since they arrived here in Dallas. There are a number of things that 
have to be looked at.'

He cautioned that unless there was transmission of blood, secretion or bodily fluids risk of infection was low.
