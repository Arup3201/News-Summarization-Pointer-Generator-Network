Jailed: Peter Chen was driving at up to twice the speed limit when he hit Ray Tutton in the early hours of Christmas Eve last year

A gambling addict who mowed down and killed a father-of-three while racing to a casino has been jailed for more than three years.

Peter Chen’s car struck pedestrian Ray Tutton with such force that he was tossed through the air like a ‘bin bag’ and landed more than 30metres away.

Chen, 40, had been doing up to 60mph in a 30mph zone and was rushing back to a casino, having had to return home to get more money during a night of gambling.

Mr Tutton, 46, and his wife Liz, 47, were walking home from a night out at a pub in Poole, Dorset, when the collision happened in the early hours of Christmas Eve last year.

Mrs Tutton later told police how her husband was slightly in front of her on a pedestrian crossing before he was flung through the air in a split second.

She said at first she thought the object in the air was a bin bag before she realised what had happened.

Mr Tutton’s lifeless body came to rest 33metres further down the road, Bournemouth Crown Court heard.

A passing paramedic stopped to help the elevator engineer but he died shortly afterwards in hospital.

Two men drove past Chen’s Nissan Micra
car and turned around to follow it when they saw both the damage to its
front and the accident scene.

Mike Coombes and Jamie Lindsay, both nightclub bouncers, eventually caught up with Chen and blocked his car in before police arrived and arrested him.

Chen, a chef, told officers he had been to a casino, spent his money and gone back home to get more funds.

Marton Booth, prosecuting, said: 'He was in a rush to get back to the casino to gamble further; he told police he was anxious to get there.

'When asked what speed he had been travelling at when he collided with Mr Tutton, Chen replied that he was driving at between 50 and 60mph in a 30mph zone.

'Mr Tutton was slightly in front of his wife and she has described seeing headlights in the distance.

'In a split second her husband was no longer there.

'She saw what she thought was a bin liner in the air and then she realised it was the body of her husband, about 33metres away from the crossing.'

Chen, a Malaysian national, pleaded guilty to a charge of causing death by dangerous driving.

Jailing Chen for three years and four months, Judge Samuel Wiggs told him: 'You were in such a hurry to get back to the casino that, on a road you must have been familiar with, you completely failed to see the light was red.

'You took the life of a hard-working family man and it doesn’t need me to go through the anguish that will have caused those close to him.

'They had no idea that the happy evening was going to turn out so tragically - you were responsible for that.'

After the case Mrs Tutton said no length of prison sentence would have been enough for her.

She said: 'It doesn’t seem like a long time but even if the maximum sentence of 14 years had been imposed it wouldn’t have been enough. Nothing will bring Ray back.

'In some ways it would have been more understandable if it had been a teenager who had been drinking; not a 40-year-old man who was stone-cold sober and all because of his gambling habit.'
