Actress Blake Lively seems to have stopped getting her hair dyed during her pregnancy, and her brown roots are starting to show amid the blonde.

The 27-year-old star recently attended Martha Stewart's American Made Summit in New York - and she still looked radiant despite the three to four inches of new hair growth.

Colorist Dana Ionato, who works at Sally Hershberger Downtown in Manhattan, told Yahoo Beauty that Ms Lively is probably being 'super cautious about any chemicals going into her body' until her baby with actor Ryan Reynolds is born next year.

Though Ms Ionato says there isn't substantial evidence that hair dye can affect a pregnancy (a claim backed by the Mayo Clinic), she said it is still ultimately up to clients to judge what is best for them.

'I mean, it's only nine months, and it your child, so I always respect the wishes of the client,' she said. 'I guarantee Blake hates her roots, but most women put the baby first.'

Stars like Kourtney Kardashian, Drew Barrymore and Snooki have famously come under scrutiny for coloring their hair while pregnant. 

'I did research about doing anything to the color of my hair while pregnant and followed all of the guidelines from my doctor and took the proper precautions necessary,' Ms Kardashian wrote on her blog in 2012 before the birth of her daughter Penelope Scotland Disick. 

Many women who do opt to dye their locks while expecting still exercise caution. Various parenting websites recommend using ammonia-free dyes; waiting until after the first trimester; avoiding procedures that directly touch the scalp; wearing a mask and rinsing the hair thoroughly afterward.

Julie Dickson, founder of Fox & Boy salon in Manhattan, says Ms Lively shouldn't be embarrassed of her hair growth. 

'Roots are awesome!' Ms Dickson told the Mail. 'Natural hair color is always darker at the root anyway, so if you can rock it, go for it!' 

Ms Lively and Mr Reynolds announced in October they were having a child. 

They have yet to release a due date or gender - but most news sources agree the baby will be born sometime in the Spring of 2015.
