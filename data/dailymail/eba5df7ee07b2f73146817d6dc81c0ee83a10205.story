Adel Taarabt appeared for QPR for the first time since his public fall-out with Harry Redknapp in Monday afternoon's reserve game against Ipswich Town.

The Moroccan's days at Loftus Road appeared to be numbered after his extraordinary spat with Redknapp last month.

Taarabt claimed his manager never takes a training session after Redknapp had accused the midfielder of being 'three stone overweight' following the 3-2 defeat to Liverpool.

Adel Taarabt has played just three first-team games for QPR this season after returning from loan at AC Milan

Taarabt laughed off claims by QPR manager Harry Redknapp that the midfielder was 'three stone overweight'

The 25-year-old was due to play for the club's Under 21s last week, but wasn't included in the draw against Swansea.

However, Taarabt came through 90 minutes in the 3-0 win against Ipswich Town as he tries to prove his fitness to his boss.

The former Spurs man, who has been hampered by an ankle injury, has been limited to just three appearances for the R's this season after returning from a loan spell at AC Milan.
