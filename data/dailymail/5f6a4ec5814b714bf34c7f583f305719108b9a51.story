Curved TVs may still seem like expensive gimmicks, but Samsung is hoping to attract those who aren't quite ready to give up their flat displays.

It is launching the world’s first bendable TV in Korea from Friday, which goes from flat to curved at the press of a button.

Viewers will also be able to control the acute angle of the curve on the 78-inch display, based on how many people are sat around it.
