Evidence: Farzana Ahmed told the court that she had witnessed her husband punching and slapping their daughter Shafilea 

A woman accused of murdering her daughter because she brought shame on the family today told a jury she lied to police because she was 'frightened' of her husband who she said would beat her.

Farzana Ahmed, 49, and her husband Iftikhar, 52, of Warrington, are on trial at Chester Crown Court charged with killing their daughter Shafilea, 17, in 2003.

On day two of Mrs Ahmed’s evidence she told the court that she had witnessed her husband punching and slapping the teenager on the night of the alleged killing.

She claimed she had 'never seen her husband so angry' and that she later followed his instructions on what to tell the police because he would beat her and she was scared what he would do to the other children.

Mrs Ahmed, who spoke with the aid of an interpreter, also claimed that she carried on believing that Shafilea was alive because of her 'maternal instinct'.

Mrs Ahmed has always denied murder, but earlier this month the jury of seven men and five women were told she had changed her account and said she witnessed her husband beat Shafilea on the night of the alleged murder.

The defendant, wearing a grey patterned head scarf and black cardigan, wiped tears away from her eyes throughout her evidence.

Mukhtar Hussain QC, defending Mrs Ahmed, on the night of September 11, 2003, she had come downstairs to find her husband hitting Shafilea in the kitchen.

'He slapped her twice and he punched her twice,' she said.

She said her daughter was not screaming but was crying, and that her husband said: 'We have done so much for you and you are still messing about.'

The defendant claimed she asked her husband what their daughter had done and he replied: 'Had you been educated you would have known what she was doing.'

The Ahmeds’ youngest daughter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, wiped tears from her eyes as she listened to her mother from the public gallery.

Mrs Ahmed said she tried to stop her husband but he punched her.

'He was very angry. I have never seen him so angry. I have seen him angry before but not like this,' she said.

She then claimed that another daughter, Mevish, tried to stop her father. Mrs Ahmed said she got Mevish out of the room.

said on the night of September 11, 2003, she had come downstairs of their house in Warrington, pictured, to find her 
husband hitting Shafilea in the kitchen

'It was for her own safety. I was scared. I thought perhaps my husband would also hit her,' she told the jury. Mrs Ahmed claims she stayed in the girls bedroom for around 25 minutes when she heard a car engine.

Her husband and Shafilea had gone. When he returned it was around 6am.

'I asked him where he had been and where was Shafilea? He said to me if you care about your life and your children's lives to not ask him that question ever again.' She added: 'I was crying. I was in shock. I was very upset.'

'I couldn't think at the time. I thought wherever my daughter was, she was safe,' Mrs Ahmed said.

She added: 'I couldn't say that she was probably dead because I am a mother and it was my maternal instinct.'

Mrs Ahmed said she asked about Shafilea again later that day but that her husband repeated his earlier threat and told her never to ask him that question again. She said she was crying and that Mr Ahmed was 'very angry. His eyes were red.'

Mr Hussain asked: 'Were you frightened?' She said she was frightened of her husband because he 'beats' her up. Asked how long this had been going on, she replied: 'Since we got married.'

Mr Hussain asked if she had told lies to the police about the night of September 11. She said yes she had, adding: 'I did what I had been asked to do by my husband... I was scared. For the sake of my children.'

It was not until last year that Shafilea's younger sister, Alesha Ahmed, provided the 'final piece of the puzzle' about her death, the prosecution said, when she disclosed that she witnessed her parents killing Shafilea at the family home.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
