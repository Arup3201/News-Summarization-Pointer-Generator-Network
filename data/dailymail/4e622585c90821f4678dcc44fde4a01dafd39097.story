A set of six-week-old twins who were born joined at the abdomen have been successfully separated in a nine-hour operation involving 40 medical staff.

Owen and Emmett Ezell are now recovering in their own beds in intensive care at Medical City Children's Hospital in Dallas, Texas - to the overwhelming relief of their parents, Dave and Jenni.

When the babies were born in Guthrie, Oklahoma on July 17, they shared a liver and intestines. Their parents, who have two other sons, moved to Dallas for the boys' medical care.

On Saturday, they were prepared for surgery and a team of doctors, surgeons and nurses worked to separate the boys, either of whom could have been lost in the operation, NewsOK reported.

The Ezells were able to say goodbye before the boys were taken to surgery.

'As a mother, I hope I never have to 
experience a moment like that again,' Jenni Ezell wrote in her 'Ezell 
Twins' blog on Tuesday.

'I didn't know what was going to happen. I 
didn't know if I would see my babies alive again, if I would see only 
one, or if I would see them after they had gone to be with their 
creator.'

But doctors successfully separated the boys' shared liver and other parts of their digestive system.

They will need further surgeries in the future; after they are two-years-old, they will require 'skin expanders' for their wounds, their mother explained. Another operation will require surgeons to pull abdominal muscles into place, which should leave them with only a neat line of a scar

After this, if the parents wish, they can opt for the boys to have a third surgery to create a belly button for each of them.

But for now, the family is just taking it one day at a time.

'They're starting to open their little 
eyes, and they're starting to wiggle their little fingers,' their 
father, Dave Ezell, told NBC-DFW. 'You can see that recognition in their 
face. It's truly heartwarming.'

The family now hopes that the twins will be able to return home in time for Christmas.

'It's wonderful for us to be able to sit here and think about, "How are we going to bring these two boys home? What are they going to be like?"' Mr Ezell said.

The couple has kept family, friends and strangers up to date on the pregnancy, birth and surgery through their blog and on Facebook.

'As far as the rest of the future steps, I know healing, breathing independently of machines, and feeding are on the horizon, but I'm not sure how long it will take,' Jenni wrote on the blog.

Roughly one out of every 200,000 live births worldwide results in conjoined twins, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center.

Around 40 to 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn, and about 35 per cent survive only one day. The survival rate is between 5 per cent and 25 per cent, the Center reported.

The condition is three times more likely to occur among females than males and a third of conjoined twins are attached at the lower chest, sharing organs.

Chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs, experts say. Although success rates have improved over the years, surgical separation is still rare. Since 1950, at least one twin has survived separation about 75 percent of the time.

After separation, most twins need intensive rehabilitation because of the malformation and position of their spines.

Although risky, there are many stories of successful separations.

Most recently, Utah twins Kendra and Maliyah Herrin, who were born sharing an abdomen, pelvis, liver, kidney, large intestine and two legs, just celebrated seven years since they were separated aged four. Their family said the girls, who are learning to walk with the aid of prosthetics, are the happiest and healthiest they have ever been.
