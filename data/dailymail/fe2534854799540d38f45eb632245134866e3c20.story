Hospital waiting lists have soared to a five-year high, with almost 2.9million patients in the queue for treatment.

New figures show that at the end of June the number of people waiting to start NHS treatment after being referred by their GP was 240,000 higher than the same time last year.

It comes as the respected medical journal The Lancet accused ministers of treating the health service like a ‘failing bank’ by trying to bail-out crisis hit units with extra money instead of taking responsibility for care.

Delays: At the end of June 2.88 million people were waiting for hospital treatment, the highest number since May 2008

The government has been stung by accusations that the NHS is struggling to cope with increased demand.

Last winter A&E departments were likened to war zones with huge increases in people turning up at casualty departments because many GPs will not work out of hours and the new NHS 111 helpline went into meltdown.

Now data shows the number of people waiting for operations and other hospital treatment has hit 2,876,836.

It is the highest level since a figure of 2,871,949 was record in May 2008.

Shadow health minister Andrew Gwynne said: ‘This year, thousands of extra patients are facing the agony of a long-awaited operation being cancelled as overflowing A&E departments need more and more hospital beds.

‘Whole hospitals are being consumed by the crisis in A&E. David Cameron wasted £3 billion on an NHS reorganisation that took the focus off patient care.

‘At the same time, almost 5,000 nursing jobs were axed and cuts to older people's care budgets left thousands more vulnerable people arriving at A&E. This is further proof you can't trust the Tories with the NHS.’

The NHS regulator Monitor has raised concerns that non-urgent operations are being called in some hospitals ‘to deal with increased A&E and non-elective pressures’.

Last week Mr Cameron announced a £500million fund for over-crowded A&Es to help ease the pressure on the NHS.

Operation: The Department for Health insists most people are still treated within 18 weeks despite rising numbers of patients on waiting lists

The Prime Minister said the emergency fund money should be used to help hospitals and social workers to ensure that the elderly no longer block beds in hospitals at weekends and at night because there are no home helps to help them leave.

But The Lancet claimed the move was evidence of ministers leaving staff to shoulder the blame for problems in services.

In a damning editorial, it said: 'One might be forgiven for thinking that the current Coalition Government views the NHS as a failing bank or business.

'This stance is one of the most cynical, and at the same time cunning, ways by which the government abdicates all responsibilities for running a health care system that has patient care and safety at its heart.'

However, the Department of Health insisted that despite the sharp increase in the number of people on waiting lists, targets were still being met.

Of those people who needed admitting to hospital for treatment, 91.7 per cent were seen within 18 weeks, the latest figures show. The national target is for 90 per cent of admitted patients to be seen within this timeframe.

Of those who did not need admitting, 97.4 per cent were seen within 18 weeks, against a target of 95 per cent.

A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘The NHS is performing well - it is treating over a million patients a month.

‘But despite this, average waiting times are low and stable and the number of patients waiting longer than 18 weeks is nearly 55,000 lower than in May 2010.

‘The number of people waiting for more than a year to start treatment is the lowest it has ever been.

‘A&E departments have been seeing 95 per cent of their patients within four hours since the end of April.’

According to the Government, the NHS is now handling 4.3 million more outpatient appointments every year compared to 2009-10.

There are 590,000 more planned procedures in hospitals every year and 2.4 million more diagnostic tests are being carried out.
