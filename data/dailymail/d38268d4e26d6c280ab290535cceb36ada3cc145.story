They went head-to-head for viewers with Upstairs Downstairs and Downton Abbey and now the BBC and ITV are at it again – with two new, almost identical period dramas.

But this time, after being trounced by ITV in the battle of Upstairs v Downton, the BBC is determined to get a head start on its rival.

It is racing to complete a new drama, The Paradise, a lavish saga set in a 19th Century department store, hoping to get it on screen before ITV’s latest big production called Mr Selfridge, which tells the story of the American tycoon who founded the famous London store.

Both dramas will cover similar ground and the BBC is keen to ensure its new eight-part show does not suffer the same fate as the revival of Upstairs Downstairs, which bombed in the ratings because Downton, ITV’s master-and-servant saga, was screened first.

A BBC source said: ‘We have a very similar situation as we did with Upstairs Downstairs and Downton Abbey and the idea is to get our new show out first.’

Both dramas will have their fair share of steamy love interest – The Paradise is based on Emile Zola’s classic 1883 novel Au Bonheur Des Dames (The Ladies’ Delight), which charted the lives and loves of staff in a fictional Parisian department store.

The show’s writer, Bill Gallagher, who wrote Lark Rise To Candleford, has relocated the action from Paris to the North East.

Mr Selfridge is based on the book Shopping, Seduction & Mr Selfridge, by Lindy Woodhead – and its screenwriter is Andrew Davies, whose previous TV hits include lusty productions of Pride And Prejudice and Sense And Sensibility, and the sexually explicit Tipping The Velvet.

The BBC has invested millions in its new drama, hoping to deliver huge audiences by offering a heady mix of sexual intrigue, class struggle and shopping.

Producer Simon Lewis said last night: ‘The Paradise is about relationships and it is about love affairs – in fact we have a lot of love affairs.’

The series chronicles the love 
triangle made up of handsome store owner John Moray, played by Game Of 
Thrones star Emun Elliott, wealthy banker’s daughter Katherine 
Glendenning, played by Elaine Cassidy, and Denise Lovett, a newly 
arrived and very ambitious shop girl played by Joanna Vanderham.

Moray is all set to marry Glendenning until Lovett enters his life  and turns his world upside down. 
  The series will also examine The Paradise’s devastating impact on smaller shops and businesses in the area.

Characters include the embittered small store owner Edmund Lovett – the uncle of shop girl Denise – played by Peter Wight, who resents the success of the newly opened department store and spends most of his time plotting its demise.

Writer Mr Gallagher said: ‘Here comes this brash new department store and there is a little old guy who has got the store across the street. He is desperately trying to cling on and survive and will not accept that his kind of working is doomed.’

Another key character is Miss Audrey, the formidable but lonely head of ladieswear, who is played by former Coronation Street star Sarah Lancashire.

The Paradise is being filmed in the Durham area, where the BBC has built elaborate sets including a mock-up of a street complete with period shop fronts.

BBC bosses plan to run a trailer for 
the show next Saturday at 8pm during the Olympic coverage and are 
believed to be planning a 9pm Sunday night slot for the show. They could
 broadcast it as early as next January to ensure it starts several weeks
 before the new ITV show.

Mr Selfridge will star Jeremy Piven, last seen in the American drama Entourage, who will play the charismatic Harry Gordon Selfridge, the man who is said to have turned shopping into a pleasure rather than a necessity.

Co-stars include Katherine Kelly, who played Becky McDonald in Coronation Street, as the alluring socialite Lady Mae.

Selfridge’s life was as colourful as anything found in the pages of a novel. Following the death of his wife in 1918, he enjoyed liaisons with a string of high-society figures including twin sisters Roszika and Janszieka Deutsch, better known as Vaudeville act The Dolly Sisters, and interior decorator Syrie Maugham.

He enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, and by the time he died in 1947 he had squandered his fortune.
