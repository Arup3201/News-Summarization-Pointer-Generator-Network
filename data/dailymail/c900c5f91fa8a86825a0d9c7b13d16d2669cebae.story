Stroll: New Bank of England Governor Mark Carney strolls through the crowds at the Wilderness festival in Oxfordshire with his wife Diana

In his lilac polo shirt, crumpled shorts and suede loafers, new Bank of England Governor Mark Carney was wearing the burdens of office remarkably lightly at the weekend.

The dressed-down 48-year-old made fixing the economy look like a walk in the park as he strolled through the crowds at a music festival in Oxfordshire with his wife Diana.

At one point he lay back on the grass with his hands behind his head and seemed to be doing a stretching exercise as he listened to a band.

The Canadian’s casual outfit might have come straight from the David Cameron guide to chillaxing. The Prime Minister was spotted in similar attire on holiday in Portugal last month.

With hopeful signs on the economy and the best summer weather for years, Mr Carney could perhaps be forgiven for making the most of his time off.

He was at the Wilderness festival in the 1,700-acre grounds of the Cornbury Park estate near Bicester.

Known as ‘Poshstock’, the festival is an hour’s drive from the Carneys’ £15,000-a-month taxpayer-funded West London home, and features a luxury spa, gourmet food and heated yurts.

Unlike the rest of the 15,000 revellers enjoying the £146-a-head festival this weekend, the Carneys were not glamping under the stars, but staying in the manor house itself - the home of Mrs Carney’s sister, Lady Tania Rotherwick.

The 17th-century building is the ancestral seat of Robin Cayzer, the 3rd Baron Rotherwick, a Conservative hereditary peer who married Tania in 2000.

The Rotherwicks famously play host to the powerful Oxfordshire set including David and Samantha Cameron - who have attended festivals at Cornbury Park in the past - and Andy Coulson, Rebekah Brooks, Jeremy Clarkson and Alex James.

Mr Carney and his wife have stayed at 
Cornbury Park several times. It is said they usually stay in the opulent
four-poster bed Bletchington bedroom.

Leaving
the cool dark rooms of the manor house this weekend, the Carneys, 
accompanied by their young daughters and other friends, sauntered past 
tents of middle-class revellers enjoying yoga classes, spa treatments 
and martial arts.

Mr Carney,
who was known by Canadians as the ‘rock-star banker’ for his economic 
abilities, told the Mail he was having ‘a very good time’ as he listened
to acapella beatbox quartet Penny Arcade perform a rendition of recent 
number one smash hit Get Lucky by electronic band Daft Punk.

Food
at the festival was provided on long table banquets at £40 a head, 
cooked up by trendy celebrity chefs Yotam Ottolenghi and Russell Norman.

Headlining on stage were folk singer Martha Wainwright, piano man of the moment Tom Odell and rock band Noah and the Whale.

Mr Carney - who last week criticised self-obsessed bankers who are so detached from reality have become ‘socially useless’ - met his wife Diana when he was studying for his doctorate at Oxford University.

She is an outspoken economist and environmental campaigner who was born in Cheltenham to a pig farmer and attended £31,000-a-year Marlborough College in Wiltshire.

Mr Carney, a former £1million-a-year Goldman Sachs banker, was poached by Chancellor George Osborne from the Bank of Canada for a five-year term.

He was lured from Canada with an £874,000 pay packet - about £100,000 more than predecessor Sir Mervyn King earned - which includes a £250,000-a-year housing allowance, or £4,800 a week.

After tax, it works out as £11,041 a month towards his rent which is believed to be nearly £15,000 per month.

The two younger Carney children have enrolled in a local junior school and the elder two are going to different secondary schools - all fee-paying establishments which will cost their parents £18,970 per term.

Last week, in an unprecedented action of ‘forward guidance’, Mr Carney confirmed interest rates would be held at their current record low of 0.5 per cent for the next three years or more - spelling more pain for savers until at least 2016.
