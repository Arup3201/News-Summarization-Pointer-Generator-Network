Smoking is set to be banned in all prisons in England and Wales, sparking fears inmates may riot when they are stopped from lighting up, it emerged last night.

As of next year, prisoners will be unable to smoke in all parts of the jails – including exercise yards.

They are expected to be offered nicotine patches to help satisfy their cravings.

A pilot project will begin next spring, before being introduced in other prisons during a 12-month period.

New ban: A smoking ban is set to be introduced in prisons across the country after staff complained they were being forced to breathe in the second-hand smoke of inmates

Those in the South West, including Exeter and Eastwood Park Women’s Prison, will pilot the ban on all tobacco products.

The Prison Service confirmed they were considering banning smoking ‘across the prison estate and as part of this are looking at possible sites as early adopters’.

Figures show about 80 per cent of the 84,300 inmates smoke and tobacco is a valuable currency that is traded on the wings.

Some jails already ban the habit for bad behaviour but the uniform ban is likely to anger those ‘well-behaved’ inmates who look forward to their cigarette breaks out in the yard to help them through the boredom of their sentences.

The rule change comes after a campaign by staff, who have long objected to breathing in the second-hand smoke of inmates.

It also comes amid fears that the Prison Service could face compensation claims from officers who claim that they are victims of passive smoking.

The 2007 smoking ban designed to protect people from the effects of second-hand smoke in public places did not apply to prison cells.

Senior prison staff were said to have been informed of the move in a letter this month.

‘You will no doubt be aware that the decision has been made that the time is right for the prison estate to adopt a tobacco and smoke-free policy to provide a smoke-free workplace/environment for our staff and prisoners,’ it reportedly said in the Times.

The letter said that as a first step a number of establishments in the South West ‘will become early adopters of the scheme’.

They would implement a complete ban on all tobacco products in late March or early April next year.

Steve Gillan, general secretary of the Prison Officers' Association, welcomed the smoking ban but told The Times its implementation would be difficult.

He said: 'There is no pretending otherwise. It could cause disturbances but they have done it successfully in Canada and in young offender institutions in England and Wales.'

He added: ‘We welcome this move. It is our policy to have smoke-free prisons for our members. We will work with the ministry to make sure it works effectively.’

One prison source said of the timetable for imposing the ban: ‘I am not sure it is the right time.

'Everything in jails is extremely stretched and more job losses are coming.’
