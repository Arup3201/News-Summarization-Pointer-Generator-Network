Halloween may be a month away, but one artist has created ghostly GIFS that turn old photographs into creepy animations

They include the haunting portrait of a princess, ghostly scenes of the First World War and even an image of an old woman who transforms into a flock of birds with a swish of her cloak.

The looped animations are the work of New York City-based art director Kevin Weir, who modifies historical black and white photographs, which he finds in the Library of Congress online archive, to create his animated scenes.

He is drawn to ‘unknowable places and persons’ in the old images, This Is Colossal reported.

Mr Weir, 26, began creating the strange GIFS during grad school and since then, his blogFlux Machine has become popular, attracting thousands of visitors.

GIFS are a type of compressed file format with a limited colour palette that can be quickly transmitted over the internet. The animations are short in length and automatically repeat so the action is on a loop.

In one of the GIFS, Princess Juliana starts a fire which sets the photo alight and peels away to reveal the original photographic portrait, before the action begins again.

The original photograph was taken in around 1915 and belongs to the Bain Collection at the Library of Congress, where Mr Weir saw it and was inspired to create a GIF.

Princess Juliana was born in 1909 and was Queen of the Kingdom of the Netherlands between 1948 and 1980. As an only child, her birth assured the royal family's survival.

She spent her childhood at Het Loo Palace in Apeldoorn, and at Huis ten Bosch Palace and Noordeinde Palace in The Hague, where she received her education at a fast pace so she was ready to succeed the throne at the age of 18.

Mr Weir told The Guardian that the princess has an air of mystery, despite probably being a normal mischievous girl. 

‘But something about the way these photographs are taken makes history unfamiliar to me. There is an unknowable quality to them.’

He said that some of the images are loaded with mysteries. ‘I sit with them for a while, just to see where they could go,’ explaining that it can take days for him to come up with a short animated story to transform an old photograph.

Some of the stories are chilling, such as the soldier in the photo entitled ‘French 42cm gun’ where dust falls out from a barrel to the ground where it forms a new soldier who picks up the first fighter's lifeless body and drags it out of shot.

Another shows a ruined tower that suddenly erupts with a shaft of light, propelling shadowy 'ghosts' into the air.

In one GIF, ghostly creatures stalk the ruins of John A Roebling's steel works in Trenton, US, which supplied armaments and artillery chains to the Allies during the First World War.

It is thought that a fire was started deliberately on January 18, 1915, which destroyed eight acres of factory as well as a block of workers' houses.

While German forces and disaffected locals were blamed, it remains as mystery as to who started the destructive blaze. 

In another photograph, a mysterious cloud reveals a foreboding black figure watching over the cleaning up of the Great Fire of 1911 in Bangor, Maine.

A small fire started in a shed and quickly spread out of control, destroying hundreds of homes and public buildings, however, remarkably, just two lives were lost. 

A portrait of Prince Henry of Prussia has been transformed by the artist, who shows the naval Admiral seemingly concentrating before shadows of himself emerge from his body.

The Prince was a younger brother of German Emperor William II and held various positions in the Imperial German Navy, including Grand Admiral.

At the beginning of World War One, Prince Henry was named Commander-in-Chief of the Baltic Fleet and when his mission ended, he left active duty with the dissolution of the monarchy in Germany.

Mr Weir said that GIF animations enable him to use suspense and freeze particular moments in his surprising stories.
