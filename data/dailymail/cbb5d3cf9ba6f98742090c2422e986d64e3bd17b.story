Newcastle United hotshot Adam Armstrong scored the winner as England's under 18s beat Switzerland in a behind-closed-doors friendly at St George's Park.

Armstrong popped up three minutes after half-time, firing home at the second attempt after Swiss goalkeeper Gregord Kobel blocked an initial one-on-one attempt.

But Neil Dewsnip's team missed several good chances and the coach will hope they are more clinical when the two sides reconvene at Walsall's Banks's Stadium on Saturday.

England coach Neil Dewsnip would be disappointed that England wasted a number of chances

It was a strong side that lined up at the England headquarters in Staffordshire, with Chelsea's Dominic Solanke, Liverpool's Sheyi Ojo and Everton's Ryan Ledson among the players on show.

Dewsnip also handed international debuts to Sheffield United midfielder Louis Reed and Fulham goalkeeper Magnus Norman.

And Norman was almost involved inside the first minute when Swiss forward Neftali Manzambi burst through, only to be denied by a last-ditch challenge by Manchester City's Tosin Adarabioyo.

Gradually, England asserted themselves and Solanke, who trained with the first team the other day, was inches away from turning home a low Ojo cross.

Ojo, the Liverpool prodigy currently out on loan at Wigan Athletic, was denied by Kobel shortly afterwards having been slipped clear by Solanke.

The pressure was relentless and Reed, keen to make a positive impression, curled an effort just wide of the post after Southampton man Josh Sims and Armstrong combined to tee him up.

The busy Kobel was again tested in the dying seconds of the half, tipping Ojo's header over the crossbar following more good build-up work from Armstrong and Everton defender Jonjoe Kenny.

After Armstrong finally made the breakthrough, England were able to relax a little but they continued to create chances at regular intervals.

Ojo fired over the bar after more good work from the lively Armstrong and Kobel was called upon to deny Solanke, who made his Chelsea first-team debut earlier this season.

Armstrong could have added a second after finding himself in an identical situation to his goal but on this occasion the goalkeeper saved.

Tammy Abraham, who has featured in Chelsea's run to the FA Youth Cup final, came on for Solanke and nearly claimed his first England goal late on, only to fire inches wide.

England play Switzerland at Walsall on Saturday (5.30pm).
