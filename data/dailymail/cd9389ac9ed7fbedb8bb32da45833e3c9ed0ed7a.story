Authorities say a naked woman was riding in the tractor-trailer that struck a school bus in north Florida, injuring 10 people.

Florida Highway Patrol Sgt. Dylan Bryan says it is unclear why the woman was not clothed when the truck hit the bus Monday afternoon. The bus was carrying elementary students to their homes.

Authorities say none of the students received life-threatening injuries, but the driver of the tractor-trailer and the woman were in critical condition.

Frantic scene: Children were screaming and crying after a tractor trailer with a naked woman inside hit a school bus and injured seven elementary school aged children 

None of the injuries are believed to be fatal.

Bradford County school officials said there were 15 students on the bus when it was hit traveling south on U.S. 301 at 2:30 p.m.

Bryan said the semi had a sleeper compartment. He did not know if the nude woman was in the cab or in the sleeper area when the accident occurred.

Bradford County Sheriff Gordon Smith said the woman appeared to have been ejected from the vehicle.

'I just remember grabbing something and throwing it over her,' he told Jacksonville.com. '... There were kids and parents.'

Jacksonville.com reports that children were screaming and crying and one girl worried about her friend still inside of the school bus.

Prior to the crash, motorists called the Florida Highway Patrol to report that the log truck, which wasn't carrying a load, was driving dangerously.

Young children: Students on the bus went to Starke Elementary School in Jacksonville, Florida and seven of them were hospitalized after the bizarre crash 

Neither police nor witnesses learned why the woman was naked.

The two drivers of the truck and the woman were hospitalized.

Seven of the 15 students on the bus were taken to the hospital but none suffered fatal injuries.

Witnesses told Jacksonville.com that the driver didn't appear to hit his brakes.

School bus driver Jennifer Swanson saw the log truck coming towards them so she hit the gas which softened the impact of the crash and prevented any injuries.

The log truck pushed the school bus almost the length of a football field.

Swanson was commended by highway patrol and the school district for calming the children until help arrived.

The school bus did provide seat belts for all passengers but it’s unknown whether or not they were wearing seat belts or not.

Mental health counselors will be available at the school for anyone at the school affected by the incident.

The Mail Online contacted Florida Highway Patrol but no one was available for comment.
