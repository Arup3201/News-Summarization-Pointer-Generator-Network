A bright green sea slug has been found to have stolen genes from the algae it eats so that it can produce energy from sunlight just like plants.

The slug, called the eastern emerald elysia or Elysia chlorotica, has incorporated genes from algae into its own chromosomes enabling it to photosynthesis.

This process essentially allows the slug to become solar powered, using the sun's energy to turn carbon dioxide and water in to the nutrients it needs to survive.

Researchers behind the discovery believe it may be possible to use this form of genetic hijacking between species to create new types of medical treatment for genetic diseases in humans.

The first known instance of creatures growing their own 'disposable penises' was discovered by researchers studying the mating habits of sea slugs.

Researchers in Japan were astonished when they realised that a group of sea slugs called Chromodoris reticulata lose their penises after sex but then grow another one a few hours later.

The creatures, also known as nudibranchs, are hermaphrodites, meaning they had both male and female organs.

But the revelation that their penises fell off and then re-grew was a surprise to scientists.

The discovery was made after a team from Osaka City University and Tokyo's Nihon University collected the sea slugs from shallow coral reefs off the coast near Okinawa.

They placed the slugs together in aquaria in pairs and observed them having sex. 

The researchers noticed that those who had recently mated were unable to do so again within 24 hours.

Looking more closely, they saw that after having sex, the creatures detached themselves from their partner then crawled away with their penises dragging along behind them. About 20 minutes later, the used penis would fall off. 

Professor Sidney Pierce, a biologist at the University of South Florida and the University of Maryland, said: 'There is no way on earth that genes from an alga should work inside an animal cell, and yet here, they do.

'They allow the animal to rely on sunshine for its nutrition. So if something happens to their food source, they have a way of not starving to death until they find more algae to eat.

'Figuring out the mechanism of this naturally occurring gene transfer could be extremely instructive for future medical applications.'

If it is possible to understand how the slug manages to use these plant genes may allow new types of genes from other species to be used to treat human diseases. 

Elysia chlorotica is found in shallow pools and salt marshes along the east coast of the United States, particularly in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Florida  and Texas

Juveniles are usually a reddish-brown colour before they begin feeding on algae. 

It has been known since the 1970s that the Elysia chlorotica is able to incorporate chloroplasts from algae into its own cells, turning them bright green.

Chloroplasts are tiny capsules of biological machinery, or organelles, inside green leaves that use sunlight to power chemical reactions that plants need to survive.

The slug sucks the sap out of the algae Vaucheria litorea and embeds into the cells of its digestive system.

The slug is then able to use these chloroplasts to produce carbohydrates and lipids for itself for up to nine months.

Yet how it is able to maintain these chloroplasts for such a long time without the support provided by a plant cell was not known.

Professor Pierce and his colleagues analysed the DNA of the slug and found that it had managed to incorporate a gene from the algae into its own chromosomes.

It uses this gene to repair damage to the chloroplasts and to keep it functioning.

Professor Pierce said: 'The gene is incorporated into the slug chromosome and transmitted to the next generation of slugs.'

'When a successful transfer of genes between species occurs, evolution can basically happen from one generation to the next.'
