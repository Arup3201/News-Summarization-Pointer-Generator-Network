The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby was forced to admit last year that the Church had invested in one of Wonga's main financial backers

The Church of England has severed its ties with controversial payday lender Wonga.

Last night, The Church Commissioners for England, which produces money to support the Church of England, said it was ‘pleased to announce’ the indirect investment exposure to Wonga in its venture capital portfolio has been removed.

A commissioners spokesman said: ‘[We] no longer have any financial or any other interest in Wonga.’

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby was forced to admit last year that the Church of England had invested in one of Wonga’s main financial backers.

This came after he had promised to compete the payday lender ‘out of business’ with Church of England-backed credit unions.

Although the amount of Church money indirectly invested in Wonga was less than £100,000 out of investments totalling more than £5bn, it proved embarrassing for the Archbishop.

In a statement last night, the Church Commissioners for England said it had not made any profit from their connections to Wonga.

It said: ‘The Church Commissioners for England are pleased to announce that their indirect investment exposure to Wonga in their venture capital portfolio has been removed.

‘The Church Commissioners no longer have any financial or any other interest in Wonga.

‘The terms ensure that the Church Commissioners have not made any profit from their investment exposure to Wonga.

‘At no time have the Commissioners invested directly in Wonga or in other pay day lenders.

‘The indirect exposure of the Commissioners through pooled funds represented considerably less than 0.01% of the value of Wonga.’

The Church Commissioners had struggled to sell off the stake because it was tied up in other investments.

Last week City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority revealed Wonga would have to pay £2.6million compensation to 45,000 people sent letters from two invented debt recovery firms

The Most Rev Justin Welby recently warned that forcing payday loan companies out of business too quickly could leave poor people at the mercy of criminal loan sharks.

Last year it was discovered the Church of England’s £5bn pension fund, which had a policy banning it from investing in payday lenders, had invested in Accel Partners, a US venture capital firm and a major Wonga investor.

Wonga has been criticised for its interest rates on loans, and the quoted APR on Wonga’s website is 5853 per cent.

And just weeks ago Wonga was ordered to pay £2.6 million to around 45,000 customers after an investigation started by the Office of Fair Trading, and the Financial Conduct Authority, found that Wonga had sent letters to customers in arrears from law firms that did not exist.

Wonga was founded by Errol Damelin and Jonty Hurwitz – both now aged 44 and originally from South Africa - in 2007.

Within two years of setting the loans company up, they had raised £14million from City investors – and now the multi-millionaires enjoy luxury homes and lifestyles.

Mr Damelin’s personal fortune is estimated at more than £34million, while Mr Hurwitz’s is said to be over £25million.

Mr Damelin, who reportedly paid himself £1million a year, has previously claimed the loans Wonga provides are a force for good.

In 2012, he said: ‘Credit in consumer society is absolutely critical. Without it, you have no social mobility...wealthy people will stay wealthy.’
