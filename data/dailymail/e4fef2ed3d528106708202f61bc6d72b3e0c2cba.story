Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured arriving at the BBC, said he was confident his plan to renegotiate Britain's EU membership would be successful

David Cameron today signalled he would call for Britain to leave the European Union if Brussels refuses his demands for change.

The Prime Minister said he would not 'sit on the fence' in the in-out referendum he has vowed to hold by the end of 2017, after trying to renegotiate the UK's membership. 

But he repeatedly insisted he remains confident his plan to overhaul the EU's powers will be successful.

The PM wants to make it harder for migrants to claim the dole, stop child benefit being sent to families living across the EU, a guarantee that Britain will never be forced to join the Euro and an exemption from the aim of 'ever closer union'. 

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch PM Mark Rutte has suggested they are willing to act on benefits and red-tape.

Mr Cameron said he was increasingly confident that a deal could be reached.

The renegotiation is expected to start soon after the general election in 2015, before a promised in-out referendum before the end of 2017.

But Mr Cameron faced repeated questions about whether he whether he would back leaving the EU if his renegotiation failed.

Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr if he would give a clear recommendation to the British people to vote yes or no in the referendum, Mr Cameron replied: 'Of course, I am not going to sit on the fence.'

He added: 'We have the referendum whether or not I have successfully negotiated. I think the negotiation will be successful.'

He insisted that he is confident of reaching agreement across to EU for changes which means he could recommend staying in.

'I am tremendously upbeat, bullish and optimistic about what Britain can achieve in terms of our our economy but also our place in Europe.'

Mr Cameron reiterated his pledge that he will not become Prime Minister if he cannot deliver an in-out referendum.

It means that such a vote will be a deal breaker for any future coalition with the Lib Dems. It also suggests Mr Cameron would quit as Tory leader, rather than lead a minority Conservative government. 

With less than two weeks to go until the European elections, Mr Cameron set out more of the changes he wants to see in Britain's relationship with Brussels. 

He said: 'We are very clear about what we want to achieve. Let's end benefit tourism, let's make sure the single market is properly safeguarded.

'Let's make sure that Parliaments can get together and block unwelcome proposals from the European Commission.

'Let's make a series of changes to make Europe more flexible, more competitive. Those are the sorts of things I want to see.'

The Prime Minister was repeatedly challenged by the BBC's Andrew Mar about what he would say at the referendum if his renegotiation fails, something he is confident will not happen

The government has already increased to the three months the time migrants must wait before they can claim benefits after they arrive in the UK. 

Mr Cameron said he wanted the limit to be much longer, adding: 'We need to make sure that the freedom to move to work is about just that. It's to go and get a job, it's not to claim.' 

He also wants to stop millions of pounds being sent abroad each year in child benefit for children who live elsewhere in the EU. 

There are around 24,000 families claiming for 40,000 children, with two-thirds of the children based in Poland.

Mr Cameron 
said he had not made 'anybody who thinks that is sensible' but admitted 
that under existing EU rules 'it seems impossible to change that'.

The
 Prime Minister said he could 'absolutely' give a cast-iron guarantee 
that the vote would go ahead in 2017 if he is returned to No 10.

Before going head-to-head with the BBC's Andrew Marr, the Prime Minister popped into a nearby Starbucks

But the comment will draw unhelpful comparisons with his last 'cast-iron' promise - to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty - which never happened because the treaty was passed by the EU before Mr Cameron came to power.

Earlier Mr Cameron told sceptics that he 'gets it' after previous plans to offer them a referendum on British membership of the European Union did not materialise.

But the Conservative leader insisted that his party is the only 'credible' option. The Tories face an electoral drubbing on May 22, possibly even pushed into third behind Ukip and Labour.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage has boasted that he will trigger a 'political earthquake' by topping the polls.  

Earlier Mr Cameron issued a direct plea to undecided voters to back his plans for Europe in this month's elections - but admits that he understands their doubts over his ability to deliver.

'Pessimist': Mr Cameron seemed to attack politicians like Nigel Farage for being overly negative

Mr Cameron launched attacks on Labour - who are not offering voters a choice on Europe - and said that they are 'flailing around' on the economy.He also hit out at Ukip, characterising them as 'doom-mongers' who are convinced Britain's best days are over.

Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, he said that 'there is only one party with a credible plan in Europe', before reiterating his aim of securing concessions from the EU on immigration, trade, justice and ending the commitment to 'ever closer union'.

Pre-empting doubts over whether he will follow through on his promises, he said: 'If you’re reading this thinking “I’ve heard all this before” – I get it. 

'I was watching, too, when Labour made Britain the doormat of Europe and signed British taxpayers up to eurozone bail-out funds. So I understand the scepticism.'

He then boasted of ways the Government had saved taxpayers from paying for bail-outs and a higher EU budget, before repeating his recent promise to resign if the referendum doesn't happen.The

Prime Minister also took an apparent swipe at Mr Farage, mocking his pessimism, although he does not directly name him, with a reference to Dad's Army character Private Frazer.

He
 said: 'There are politicians who refuse to be upbeat about Britain. To 
them, pessimism equals patriotism. They insist that our best days are 
behind us and that everything is bound to get worse. 

'Like Private Frazer politicians they're perennially crying out that 'we're all doomed'.'

By contrast, Mr Cameron said that he and his party are 'optimistic' about the future of Britain.

Polling 
has indicated Nigel Farage's party will come first in the UK's European 
Parliament results, with the Conservatives pushed into a humiliating 
third place.
