A death-row convict escaped his cell after breaking the lock and convinced a murder suspect to join him for a tryst at Georgia's Fulton County Jail last month.

The incident highlights a problem at the over-crowded jail, where guards are put at risk due to faulty locks that prisoners have been jimmying with toilet paper and soap.

On May 26, convicted killer Norris Speed sneaked out of his cell in the jail's medical wing to make a call when he came across an old acquaintance, Jasmine Jones.

Speed, who was sentenced to death for murdering Atlanta police Officer Niles Johangten in 1991, has been held at the jail since July 2011 for ongoing hearings. Jones was booked in October 2011 on murder and robbery charges.

Jones had been let out of her cell to take a shower when she came across Speed, but he convinced her instead to go back to his cell for a quickie.

'She stated that inmate Speed popped opened the side door and told her to come into his cell. Inmate Jones then stated that she was tempted and let the lust get the best of her so she willingly entered inmate Speed’s cell although she was extremely nervous,' Sheriff's Deputy Michael Watts wrote in an incident report obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

When Watts noticed Jones was missing, he found the two together in Speed's cell.

Jones told authorities that they had consensual sex, while Speed said the deputy's timing meant he wasn't able 'to do anything'.

The county is currently spending $5million to replace 1,300 faulty locks at the jail - a project which is due to be completed by July.
