Sally Bercow joined in with thousands of other Twitter users who speculated on the identity of an anonymous child abuser

Speaker's wife Sally Bercow may be facing legal action after she wrongly hinted that Lord McAlpine was a child abuser on Twitter - but she still can't stop tweeting.

The outspoken wife of Tory John Bercow today joked merrily about the unfolding crisis and even compared ex-BBC boss George Entwistle to terror suspect Abu Qatada.

She had been forced to apologise to former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine after she joined an internet frenzy that followed a botched Newsnight report wrongly implicating him.

On
November 4, Mrs Bercow tweeted:  'Why is Lord McAlpine trending? 
*Innocent face*' – a reference to the fact the peer's name was being 
repeatedly mentioned on Twitter. 

She then issued an apology - alongside Guardian columnist George Monbiot - when lawyers for the former Thatcher aide threatened to sue.

The mother-of-three wrote: 'I *have* apologised. I was irresponsible.'

But she was back on fine Twittering form later, retweeting a comment that said 'Can't help but think it would be easier to get rid of Abu Qatada if he were Director General of the BBC' and commenting 'Lol!'.

She then retweeted another message that stated: 'Did we see Rupert Murdoch stepping down because the shoddy and unacceptable mistakes his journalists made? No. We did not.'

Earlier she had remained defiant when asked by one user if she was not the 
'teensiest bit embarrassed (and fearful of impending legal action)?', 
replying simply: 'Nope.' She added in another tweet: 'Now counting coins
in piggy bank coz Lord McAlpine will probably sue my a***.'

She says she has not heard from Lord McAlpine's lawyers.

Legal experts say the pair's public apologies might not be enough to save them from being sued for libel.

Niri
Shan, head of media law at Taylor  Wessing, said: 'Are you responsible 
for what you publish on your Twitter account? The answer is yes.

Twitter gaffe: Speaker's wife Sally Bercow (left) has apologised after highlighting Twitter discussions that falsely named Lord McAlpine (right) as a child abuser following a botched Newsnight report

'They're just as liable as any broadcaster or newspaper who named him.'

In an attempt to save face she tweeted this morning that she was sorry but maintained she was not admitting being libellous.

'Yes, I have apologised for McAlpine tweet. In which I noted that his name was trending (which, at the time, it was). I was irresponsible,' she wrote.

'I have not heard from McAlpine's lawyers. Tho' I may do. As may thousands of Twitter users, some of whom tweeted far worse.

'Very sorry. Was irresponsible & mischievous. Libellous? I don't think so. But we'll have to see...

'Wish the focus would shift back onto, y'know, *child abuse* - not just BBC & libel threats.'

The one-time Celebrity Big Brother 
contestant Mrs Bercow joined in with thousands speculating on the 
identity of the unnamed senior Conservative peer accused of abusing 
former care resident Steven Messham at a home in North Wales during the 
Seventies and Eighties.

Mrs
Bercow's Tweet came before it came to light that Lord McAlpine had no 
involvement with the alleged abuse at the Bryn Estyn care home.

When asked by MailOnline who Lord 
McAlpine would be taking legal action against, James Henderson of 
Pellham Bell Pottinger, said: 'I can't tell you that at the moment, it's
currently in legal process.

Sally Bercow took to Twitter to comment on speculation as to the identity of the Tory at the centre of a Newsnight investigation

'I can't confirm any names but I am not ruling any out.'

MailOnline attempted to contact Mrs Bercow for a response today but she declined to comment.

Mr Monbiot also wrote cryptic messages on the social networking site, including: 'Historical fact of the week: Lord McAlpine was a well-known treasurer of the Conservative Party during the Thatcher era.' He has also said sorry in a blog that was headed 'an abject apology'.

The BBC was forced to apologise to 
Lord McAlpine, a friend and ally of Margaret Thatcher, after the claims 
made by BBC 2’s current affairs flagship.

As a result of the programme, Lord 
McAlpine was wrongly named on the internet as the Tory politician 
referred to, but not directly named, in the programme.

Following the false claims, BBC Director General George Entwistle 
resigned last night with further senior figures at the Corporation 
expected to follow suit.

Speaking today, Lord Patten, chair of the BBC Trust, described the investigation as 'disfigured'. 

He said: 'I think he felt he (Entwistle) should take responsibility for the awful journalism which disfigured that Newsnight programme.'

Aside from her infamous appearance on 
reality TV, Mrs Bercow has hit the headlines on numerous occasions for 
her outlandish antics which include posing naked except for a bedsheet and 
admitting binge-drinking and one night stands.

She has also courted controversy on 
Twitter, by slamming this summer's Jubilee celebrations and discussing 
drug taking with her 56,000 followers.

Journalists quickly laid seige to Lord McAlpine's Italian home after his name was connected with the scandal but it soon emerged that the story was false.

Lord McAlpine's name was cleared in connection with abuse at the Bryn Estyn care home in the original Waterhouse inquiry in 1998.

His cousin Jimmie McAlpine was originally named as the object of rumours by people connected with the care home.

Mesham told the inquiry that he believed a McAlpine was guilty of abusing him but would not reveal who told him so or the accused's first name, but he did say that the McAlpine in question was dead.

Lord McAlpine was hounded by press in connection with the case but it soon became clear that he had nothing to do with the case.
