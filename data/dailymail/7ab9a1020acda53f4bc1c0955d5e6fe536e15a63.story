Emil Metodiev was allowed into the UK despite having a string of convictions for theft and burglary

A Bulgarian with a string of convictions in his homeland has been jailed for breaking into a home just nine days after coming to the UK.

Emil Metodiev was caught after being chased by a homeowner who found him stealing a handbag, cash, war  medals, mobile phones and jewellery.

It is thought the 32-year-old, jailed for theft at least four times in Bulgaria,  came to Britain with the sole intention of committing crime.

Metodiev arrived here on October 22 after leaving his wife and the clothes shop they ran in the capital city, Sofia. Nine days later, Denise Toms, 55, woke up to find the downstairs of her home in Southend, Essex, had been ransacked.

Her son Adam, 19, saw Metodiev fleeing through the back garden and chased after him wearing  just his underpants, before police officers were able to arrest the Bulgarian.

Appearing at Basildon Crown Court, Metodiev, who had pleaded guilty to one count of burglary at an earlier hearing, was sentenced to 16 months in prison. He will be deported at the end of his sentence.

Richard Kelly, prosecuting, told how Metodiev had arrived in the UK from his home country by train. He said: ‘He had only been in the UK for a few days and had no independent means of income. It is not unreasonable to conclude that the reason he came to the UK was to commit crime.’

The court heard a partial record of Metodiev’s offences in Bulgaria, which included seven separate convictions for theft and larceny between 2002 and 2007.

The home (pictured), which he targeted at 7am on October 31, is owned by Trevor Toms, 62

He was jailed at least four times for
 theft, fined once and also given a three-year prevention order. Despite
 these convictions, Metodiev was allowed to enter the UK because EU law 
states that previous criminal convictions do not constitute automatic 
grounds for restricting the right to move freely within the bloc. 
Bulgarians and Romanians gained the right to visa-free travel to the UK 
in 2007, when their countries joined the EU.

Metodiev
 told the court he had caught the 11pm train to Southend on the night of
 the burglary because he wanted to be by the seaside. He had earlier 
been staying at a hotel in London, but claimed he had run out of money 
because a business associate had failed to repay a debt.

After walking around for several hours he decided to burgle the £325,000 detached home owned by Mrs Toms and her husband Trevor.

The Bulgarian burglar was caught after being pursued by homeowner Trevor Toms (right), 62, and his 19-year-old son, Adam (left), who chased the crook across gardens in only his underwear

Recorder
 Matthew Lowe praised Adam Toms for his bravery in  pursuing Metodiev. 
He said: ‘It is unlikely that without the brave actions of Mr Toms you 
would ever had been caught.’ Last night council worker Mr Toms, 62, who 
works for the council, revealed the family’s surprise at hearing 
Metodiev’s long list of previous convictions.

He
 told the Mail: ‘We fear we may have been targeted as I do not believe 
his story that he came to Southend because he wanted to be by the 
seaside.

‘If people want to
 come to Britain to earn a living then I think that is great – 
unfortunately there will always be a handful who want to exploit the 
system.’

He added: ‘It does seem like he came over with the express intention of taking people’s property.’

There
 are a number of reasons why UK Border Agency staff can reject a 
convicted criminal’s entry into the country, according to official 
guidance.

One of the given reasons is if the person is a ‘persistent offender who shows a particular disregard for the law’.

In addition, a criminal who has been sentenced to four years or more in prison can always be turned away.

Meanwhile,
 those who have been convicted to a spell of imprisonment lasting 
between 12 months and four years can be rejected entry unless a period 
of ten years has passed since the end of their sentence.

People
 who have been convicted to a period of less than a year can be turned 
away unless a period of five years has passed since the end of the 
sentence.
