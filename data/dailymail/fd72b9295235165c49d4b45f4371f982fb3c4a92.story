The Queen is hunting for a £78,500-a-year helicopter pilot – twice the pay the Duke of Cambridge will get for flying the same aircraft.

The job of ‘aircraft captain’ is being advertised on the British Monarchy website and asks for people with ‘VVIP experience’.

The Duke of Cambridge (left) will earn £40,000 a year as an air ambulance pilot, which he will donate to charity; Her Majesty the Queen is hunting for a £78,500-a-year helicopter pilot

The advert says: ‘You must be willing to undertake regular travel across the UK and overnight as necessary.’

It says the successful applicant must have ‘excellent interpersonal skills, with experience of liaising with a wide range of stakeholder {sic}’.

Prince William will earn £40,000 a year as an air ambulance pilot, which he will donate to charity. Prince Harry flew Apache gunships in Afghanistan, while the Duke of York flew helicopters in the 1982 Falklands War.
