A New York woman allegedly kidnapped and forced into prostitution in cities across America has finally been freed by police in Utah.

The unidentified 23-year-old was allegedly grabbed in Manhattan by Jean Joseph and Tara L. Pinnock, who took her on a nightmare road trip across the United States.

The victim was knocked almost unconscious by Joseph as she stood on a Manhattan street near the busy midtown Port Authority Bus Station, police said.

He dragged her into his car and then drove out of state stopping at Chicago, Grand Junction, Colorado, Denver and finally Salt Lake City.

At each stop, she was forced into prostitution and Joseph twice sexually assaulted her in Chicago, according to police.

Pinnock placed prostitution ads for
 the victim and arranged the sex between clients and the victim over the
 phone, police said.

After several attempts, the woman finally made her escape after several weeks when she rang the emergency services from a Salt Lake City hotel car park in the area of 110 West Street and 600 South on Sunday.

When officers responded, they found the woman hiding behind a post. She was taken to a local hospital where doctors found evidence of old injuries, Salt Lake City Police Sergeant Robin Heiden said.

Police arrested Joseph and Pinnock. Joseph, 26, was charged with four felony counts of human trafficking, kidnapping/abduction, aggravated assault and rape.

Pinnock, 24, was charged with two felony counts of human trafficking and a hold for U.S. Marshals.

In February, Pinnock was charged with prostitution in Stamford, Connecticut, and held on bail after police there ramped up efforts against human trafficking and prostitution during the Super Bowl.

She was among nine people arrested as part of Operation Recovered Innocence.

‘The operation was conducted in an effort to recover victims of child prostitution, which was in support of a larger FBI effort in the tri-state area to combat child prostitution during Super Bowl week,’ said a Connecticut police spokesman.

Four underage girls were rescued as part of that operation.

‘The victim had been with Joseph and Pinnock for about two or three weeks. Their next destination was likely Las Vegas or California,’ Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told ABC News today.

Sergeant Heiden said: ‘She was able to call 911 late Sunday. She says she tried to escape along the way on one of her stops but was unsuccessful.

‘She was found at a parking lot near the hotel where the suspects were arrested. When officers arrived she was positioned behind a pillar hiding presumably from the suspects.’

Pinnock was arrested for acting as a guard over the victim and ‘requiring her to ask for permission to access various items,’ the police report stated.

‘There were visible small scrapes and older bruises on the victim,’ Heiden told ABC News. ‘She was taken to a local hospital and released shortly after.’

Pinnock and Joesph are being held at the Salt Lake County Jail awaiting their preliminary court hearing, according to sheriff’s office.

Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Cammie Skogg does not know if the suspects had lawyers.

It was the second time in recent months that a woman has said she escaped a captor in Salt Lake City after being abducted on the East Coast, Heiden said.

‘It could be happening more than we think it is,’ she said.

Salt Lake City police said they are working with the FBI on the investigation.
