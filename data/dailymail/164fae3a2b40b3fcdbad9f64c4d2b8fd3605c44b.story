Bad designs and unchecked contractors contributed to failing batteries in Boeing's 787 Dreamliners that led to one catching on fire at Boston's Logan Airport in 2013, safety officials determined.

The National Transportation Safety Board released a report Monday that found the plane's battery had a faulty design that neither Boeing nor the Federal Aviation Authority stepped in to fix.

'The investigation identified deficiencies in the design and certification processes that should have prevented an outcome like this,' said acting NTSB chairperson Christopher Hart in a statement.

Catastrophe: Bad designs and unchecked contractors contributed to failing batteries in Boeing's 787 Dreamliners that led to one catching on fire at Boston's Logan Airport in 2013, safety officials determined

'Fortunately, this incident occurred while the airplane was on the ground and with firefighters immediately available.'

Ars Technica breaks down the two batteries aboard the 787, a main battery that powers maintenance systems and provides backup power to control systems, and a rear battery that can start an auxiliary engine used for ground power and backup power in flight.

According to the NTSB investigation, the rear batteries became overheated shortly before the Boston fire, leading to a 'thermal runaway,' in which a chemical reaction was triggered that released heat and caused the batteries to catch fire.

The fire, which happened back in January 2013, happened aboard a 787 that had just arrived from Tokyo to Boston's Logan International Airport. The plane was empty at the time.

After the fire, the FAA grounded the entire fleet of 787 Dreamliners  while the incident was investigated.

The NTSB study cited internal short circuiting and poor 'thermal management' in the large lithium-ion batteries as leading to the runaway.

Another issue was one of accountability during the design process, exacerbated by the complex chain between manufacturer, contractor and subcontractor working on the battery. 

The batteries themselves were manufactured by GS Yuasa. The Japanese corporation had been contracted by French aerospace technology firm Thales, which was working for Boeing.

According to the report, Thales changed certain plans without consulting Boeing, plans which GS Yuasa then deviated from.

According to the NTSB probe, neither the FAA or Boeing audited the battery maker, allowing Thales to perform its own investigations, which found no problems related to battery or cell manufacturing.

After the fire, the FAA and Boeing did audit GS Yuasa's work, and what they found did not inspire confidence.

Their technicians weren't following instructions for building or installing battery components and there was 'no traceability [of components] to assembly drawing and instructions,' the report read.

The 'non-compliance items at Thales involved adherence to contractual requirements for Boeing's approval on drawing or procedural changes,' the NTSB investigation found.

Battery problems only compound issues with the 787, with cracks in wings of aircraft still being manufactured discovered more recently.  

In a statement to MailOnline Boeing said: 'We have reviewed the NTSB's report and appreciate the hard work of the NTSB and all other investigation parties, which has advanced the understanding of this incident. We concur with the report's probable cause finding – a short circuit within one battery cell led to venting and cell-to-cell propagation that caused the battery failure. 

'We remain confident in the comprehensive improvements made to the 787 battery system following this event, and in the overall performance of the battery system and the safety of the airplane. We continue to work reliability improvements on the 787 and will do so throughout the span of the program.'
