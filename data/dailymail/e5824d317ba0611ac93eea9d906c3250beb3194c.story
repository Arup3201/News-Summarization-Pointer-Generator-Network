Crystal Palace remain favourites to sign Wigan midfielder James McArthur.

Leicester City had a £7million bid for the 26-year-old accepted this week but the deal fell down over the proposed payment structure.

Burnley had four offers rejected for McArthur but fell short of Wigan's valuation while Aston Villa have also shown an interest.

Warnock is keen on Norwich striker Gary Hooper, QPR's Armand Traore, Zeki Fryers of Tottenham and has enquired about taking Steven Taylor from Newcastle.
