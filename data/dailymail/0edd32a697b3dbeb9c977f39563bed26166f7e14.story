These astonishing images show a traditional Indian buffalo race held in an Indian village following the tradition of more than a thousand years.

Over the centuries Indians have gathered for the famous Kambala (buffalo race) which sees pairs of buffaloes racing around muddy waters.

The pictures were taken at the annual Mulki Seeme Arasu Kambala (slush track buffalo race) held in Padupanambur, a village near Mangalore in the state of Karnataka.

The sport has a history spanning many centuries in the coastal district and the Kambala season generally starts in November and lasts until March.

Historians date the roots of the sport back to more than a thousand years. Kambala was held by farmers to pay tribute to their gods for protecting their crops.

As well as the races, there was a festival with celebrations and a host of other games.

Some historians say Kambala also marked the beginning of the second sowing season. Historically, the buffaloes were paraded before the crowd to the accompaniment of drums.

A famous Indian saying about the race includes the line: 'Silence rules the air as thousands watch in stunned anticipation!

'The man is crouching behind the buffaloes on a sliver of wood attached to the animals. Not a muscle moves. Only the wind is playing on his lock of hair. For him the race is all that matters.'

According to Times of India, there are more than 40 Kambalas held annually.
