Take a dollop of Justin Bieber, a spoonful of Jack Whitehall, add the essence of Zack Efron, whisk in a pinch of Ant and Dec. Stir. Pop on YouTube at 180 degrees. Ping! Now multiply by two.

What you have before you is Jack and Finn Harries, a pair of 19-year-old identical twin brothers who have won the hearts of girls the world over with their boisterous YouTube channel, JacksGap, a channel that now boasts some 1.3m subscribers - and an average of one million hits per video.

A collection of quirky, humorous, irreverent, charitable and daring ogs, JacksGap was initially launched by Jack to keep the west London boys' family and friends abreast of the pair's gap year travels after leaving school.

JacksGap is a YouTube collection of the twins' videos, most of which have over one million hits - the whole channel has 1.3m subscribers

(Incidentally, the pair attended independent Barnes 
day school The Harrodian, which counts Robert Pattinson, Jack Whitehall,
Made In Chelsea's Caggie Dunlop and Sienna Miller's partner and baby-daddy Tom 
Sturridge as former pupils)

And their vlog had to be good. After all, the Harries boys - who also have a younger sister named Emmy Lou - have a pretty high-flying creative family to entertain.

Their parents are Bafta Award-winning producer of The Queen Andy Harries and documentary film-maker and novelist Rebecca Frayn. Their maternal grandparents are award-winning novelist and playwright Michael Frayn and journalist Claire Tomalin.

Who can resist two dashing identical twins larking about in a pair of novelty Australian umbrella hats?

Filmed in their Chiswick home, JacksGap was originally intended to be a video diary of the twins' gap year that would keep their family and friends up-to-date with their travels

The twins already have a YouTube channel, and their own website is currently under construction

Jack - a comic actor who starred in Channel 4 sketch show School Of Comedy and, once, a KFC advert - launched the video diary alone, starring in, producing and editing the videos himself. In one he unicycles around his bedroom while playing the harmonica and juggling. A few people watched.

But when he introduced his 
identical twin brother Finn, the vlogging community went berserk.

Obviously. I mean, who doesn't want to watch a pair of charismatic, 
well-spoken chaps with excellent hair bungee jumping in their birthday 
suits, laughing their way through the 'cinnamon challenge' or raising awareness of the 
Aids crisis in South Africa? See? Charitable, too.

Writing in The Times, the twins' mother has explained how teenage superfans now camp outside their family home - and even hunt them down on holidays as far afield as Sri Lanka.

Frayn said: 'One minute our twins Jack and Finn were average, anonymous 18-year-old post A-level students... and the next there was fan mail to the ceiling, girls watching our house and sometimes - and more alarmingly - flash mobs of eager teenagers, including a posse that appeared on the last day of our family holiday in Sri Lanka.'

She added that Finn, who 'loathes public performance', initially refused to be in Jack's films, and viewed his brother's activities with 'lofty disdain'. But...

'After much persuasion, he acquiesced and the film Twins soon became the channel’s most popular film,' Frayn said.

'The fact that Jack had a twin was a revelation to the admiring and mainly female fan base. A brand identity was emerging, and now both sons appeared to have been bitten by the YouTube bug.'

So popular are the boys now that Sky TV has offered them a series and Capital Radio a Saturday show. To their parents' initial 'dismay', the brothers chose to drop out of their respective universities (Jack from Bristol, Finn from Leeds) to concentrate on their now-lucrative film enterprise.

They registered a new company name - Digital Natives Studios - and JacksGap is now the 144th biggest YouTube channel in the world - their films have had 50 million viewings. And not many gap year diarists can say that.
