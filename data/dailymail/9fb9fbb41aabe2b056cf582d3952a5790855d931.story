Snubbed: Traditionalist Anglican leaders are threatening to snub new Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby over gay clergy

Traditionalist Anglican leaders are threatening to snub the new Archbishop of Canterbury in a furious row over gay clergy.

Conservative archbishops from Africa and Asia, who are among Anglicanism’s most senior clerics, are planning to boycott a meeting called by Archbishop Justin Welby that is scheduled to take place after his enthronement this week.

The leaders are flying in for Archbishop Welby’s formal installation service in Canterbury Cathedral on Thursday.

Archbishop Welby, the nominal head of the 70 million members of the worldwide Anglican Church, called the behind-the-scenes meeting in an effort to patch up divisions.

He is so concerned he has appointed the Church’s first ‘director of reconciliation’, Canon David Porter of Coventry Cathedral, to broker a peace.

But the conservative primates are so furious with Church of England plans to allow gay clergy in civil partnerships to become bishops that they are expected to boycott the gathering.

They are also unlikely to sit at the same table as their liberal counterpart from the United States, Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori,  who has already consecrated openly gay bishops.

According to leaked documents seen by The Mail on Sunday, at least three senior African archbishops have privately urged conservative colleagues to shun the gathering.

In the documents, the Primate of Kenya, Archbishop Eliud Wabukala, said he recommended that ‘we show our commitment to the Anglican Communion by being present for the service at Canterbury Cathedral . . . but do not participate in the “collegial time” being proposed by Archbishop Welby’.

He said the new Archbishop of Canterbury had ‘given us no clear indication of the matters for discussion’ and that primates ‘who have led the way in promoting false teaching’ will be welcomed by Dr Welby.

He said his views were shared by the Primate of Nigeria, Archbishop Nicholas Okoh, and the Primate of Uganda, Archbishop Stanley Ntagali, but sources said the African and Asian archbishops would not make a final decision about attending the meeting until this week.

Nine primates issued a statement last month condemning the Church of England’s bishops for declaring that gay clergy in civil partnerships could now become bishops – as long as they remained celibate.

Several African Anglican churches have said they would break off relations with the Archbishop of Canterbury if the Church of England appoints a gay bishop.

Last night, the Bishop of Liverpool, James Jones, became the most senior Church of England cleric to urge the Church to bless gay couples in civil partnerships.

Lambeth Palace declined to  comment.
