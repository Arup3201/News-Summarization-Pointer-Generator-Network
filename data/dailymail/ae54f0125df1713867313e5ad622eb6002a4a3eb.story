For more than a decade they toiled 
in the strange, boxy-looking building on the hill above the municipal 
airport, the building with no windows (except in the cafeteria), the 
building filled with secrets.

They wore protective white jumpsuits,
and had to walk through air-shower chambers before entering the 
sanitized 'cleanroom' where the equipment was stored in the building in 
Danbury, Connecticut.

They spoke in code. Few knew the true
identity of 'the customer' they met in a smoke-filled, wood-paneled 
conference room where the phone lines were scrambled. When they 
traveled, they sometimes used false names, the Associated Press reports.

At one point in the 1970s there were more than 1,000 people in the Danbury area working on 'The Secret.'

Though they worked long hours under intense deadlines, sometimes missing family holidays and anniversaries, they could tell no one - not even their wives and children - what they did.

They were engineers, scientists, draftsmen and inventors - 'real cloak-and-dagger guys,' says Fred Marra, 78, with a hearty laugh.

He is sitting in the food court at the Danbury Fair mall, where a group of retired co-workers from the former Perkin-Elmer Corp. gather for a weekly coffee. Gray-haired now and hard of hearing, they have been meeting here for 18 years.

They while away a few hours nattering about golf and politics, ailments and grandchildren. But until recently, they were forbidden to speak about the greatest achievement of their professional lives.

'Ah, Hexagon,' Ed Newton says, gleefully exhaling the word that stills feels almost treasonous to utter in public.

It was dubbed 'Big Bird' and it was considered the most successful space spy satellite program of the Cold War era. 

From
1971 to 1986 a total of 20 satellites were launched, each containing 60
miles of film and sophisticated cameras that orbited the earth snapping
vast, panoramic photographs of the Soviet Union, China and other 
potential foes.

their lives - but until recently were unable to talk of the secretive 
work they carried out

The film was shot back through the earth's atmosphere in buckets that parachuted over the Pacific Ocean, where C-130 Air Force planes snagged them with grappling hooks.

The scale, ambition and sheer 
ingenuity of Hexagon KH-9 was breathtaking. The fact that 19 out of 20 
launches were successful (the final mission blew up because the booster 
rockets failed) is astonishing.

So too is the human tale of the 45-year-old secret that many took to their graves.

Hexagon was declassified in September. 
Finally Marra, Newton and others can tell the world what they worked on 
all those years at 'the office.'

'My name is Al Gayhart and I built spy satellites for a living,' announced the 64-year-old retired engineer to the stunned bartender in his local tavern as soon as he learned of the declassification. 

'It was intensely demanding, thrilling and the greatest experience of my life,' says Gayhart, who was hired straight from college and was one of the youngest members of the Hexagon 'brotherhood.'

He describes the excitement as teams 
pored over hand-drawings and worked on endless technical problems, using
'slide-rules and advanced degrees' (there were no computers), knowing 
they were part of such a complicated space project. 

The
intensity would increase as launch deadlines loomed and on the days 
when 'the customer' - the CIA and later the Air Force - came for 
briefings. On at least one occasion, former President George H.W. Bush, 
who was then CIA director, flew into Danbury for a tour of the plant.

Memories: Ed Newton, left, and Fred Marra, right, reminisce about their work throughout the 1970s. The operations were so secretive, workers were not even allowed to tell their families what they did

Though
other companies were part of the project - Eastman Kodak made the film 
and Lockheed Corp. built the satellite - the cameras and optics systems 
were all made at Perkin-Elmer, then the biggest employer in Danbury.

'There were many days we arrived in the dark and left in the dark,' says retired engineer Paul Brickmeier, 70.

He recalls the very first briefing on Hexagon after Perkin-Elmer was awarded the top secret contract in 1966. Looking around the room at his 30 or so colleagues, Brickmeier thought, 'How on Earth is this going to be possible?'

One thing that made it possible was a hiring frenzy that attracted the attention of top engineers from around the north east. 

Perkin-Elmer also commissioned a new 270,000-square-foot building for Hexagon — the boxy one on the hill.

Waiting for clearance was a surreal experience as family members, neighbors and former employers were grilled by the FBI, and potential hires were questioned about everything from their gambling habits to their sexuality.

'They wanted to make sure we couldn't be bribed,' Marra says.

Clearance could take up to a year. During that time, employees worked on relatively minor tasks in a building dubbed 'the mushroom tank' - so named because everyone was in the dark about what they had actually been hired for.

Joseph Prusak, 76, spent six months 
in the tank. When he was finally briefed on Hexagon, Prusak, who had 
worked as an engineer on earlier civil space projects, wondered if he 
had made the biggest mistake of his life.

'I
thought they were crazy,' he says. 'They envisaged a satellite that was
60-foot long and 30,000 pounds and supplying film at speeds of 200 
inches per second. The precision and complexity blew my mind.'

Several years later, after numerous successful launches, he was shown what Hexagon was capable of — an image of his own house in suburban Fairfield.

'This was light years before Google Earth,' Prusak said. 'And we could clearly see the pool in my backyard.'

According to the National 
Reconnaissance Office, a single Hexagon frame covered a ground distance 
of 370 nautical miles, about the distance from Washington to 
Cincinnati. 

Early Hexagons averaged 124 days in space, but as the satellites became more sophisticated, later missions lasted twice as long.

'At
the height of the Cold War, our ability to receive this kind of 
technical intelligence was incredible,' says space historian Dwayne 
Day. 

'We needed to know 
what they were doing and where they were doing it, and in particular if 
they were preparing to invade Western Europe. Hexagon created a 
tremendous amount of stability because it meant American decision makers
were not operating in the dark.'

From the outset, secrecy was a huge concern, but it was impossible to conceal the launches at Vandenberg Air Force base in California, and aviation magazines made several references to Big Bird. In 1975, a 60 Minutes television piece on space reconnaissance described an Alice in Wonderland world, where American and Soviet intelligence officials knew of each other's 'eyes in the sky' - and other nations did, too - but no one confirmed the programs or spoke about them publicly.

Perkin-Elmer was considered a prized place to work, with good salaries and benefits, golf and softball leagues, lavish summer picnics (the company would hire an entire amusement park for employees and their families) and dazzling children's Christmas parties.

The city's mayor, Mark Boughton, only 
discovered that his father had worked on Hexagon when he was invited to 
speak at an October reunion ceremony on the grounds of the former plant.
His father, Donald Boughton, also a former mayor, was too ill to attend
and died a few days later.

The painstaking work was carried with the aid of slide-rules and advanced degrees in the pre-computer age

'Learning about Hexagon makes me view him completely differently,' Boughton says. 'He was more than just my Dad with the hair-trigger temper and passionate opinions about everything. He was a Cold War warrior doing something incredibly important for our nation.'

For Betty Osterweis the ceremony was bittersweet, too. Not only did she learn about the mystery of her late husband's professional life. She also learned about his final moments.

'All these years,' she said, 'I had wondered what exactly had happened' on that terrible day in 1987 when she received a phone call saying her 53-year-old husband, Henry Osterweis, a contract negotiator, had suffered a heart attack on the job. At the reunion she met former co-workers who could offer some comfort that the end had been quick.

Standing in the grounds of her late husband's workplace, listening to the tributes, her son and daughter and grandchildren by her side, Osterweis was overwhelmed by the enormity of it all — the sacrifice, the secrecy, the pride.

'To know that this was more than just a company selling widgets ... that he was negotiating contracts for our country's freedom and security,' she said.

'What a secret. And what a legacy.'
