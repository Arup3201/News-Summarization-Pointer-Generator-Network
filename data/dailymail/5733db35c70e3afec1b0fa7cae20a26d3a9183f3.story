Want to know the secret to Kelly Brook, Pink and Kelly Osbourne's flat stomachs? They're all fans of hula hooping. The childhood past-time has resurged in popularity as a means of keeping fit in recent years.

But now the trend has been given a new twist in the form of a pop up class in London where hundreds of fitness fans got into the groove in unison.

Organised by the website Fitness-freak.com, the pop up classes at London's Shoreditch Town Hall were lead by 'Marawa the Amazing'.

Get into the groove: Marawa the Amazing from Britain's Got Talent led the hula hooping pop up event

All body workout: Mastering the technique can improve core strength and flexibility

She's a globe-trotting 'hoop master' who can spin 133 hoops around her body at the same time and was once a finalist on Britain’s Got Talent.

Tracey Cooper, who writes the blog The Brunette That Sweats attended the class and said it was a fun but effective workout.

She writes: 'Our masterclass began with a Marawa talking us through the basics, most of us in the room openly admitted we were novices, so we learnt how to keep the hoop spinning. Optimistically we all tried to keep our hoops up and our pelvises rocking whilst Beyoncé warbled on for a whole track. 

'Marawa taught us lots of tricks... spinning one hoop above our heads, whilst whittling our waists at the same time.'

Fun fitness: Hula hooping can burn 400 calories an hour and you can do it in your own home if you can't get to an organised class

She added: 'If you turned up expected a high intensity sweat fest then you were always going to disappointed. That said, I definitely felt it in my abs and thighs the next day and you only have to look at Marawa to see how good hula hooping is for you, she is a walking testament.'

Singer Grace Jones, 65, became another 'walking testament' to the hobby when she famously swung a hoop round her slim waist while performing at the Queen's Jubilee concert last year.

Hula hooping is under-going a revival thanks to pop up classes like this as it actually dates back centuries. There's evidence that the Egyptians and ancient Greeks whirled hoops around their waists for fun and fitness.

Fitness Freak's pop up events were so successful they have organised another class in York Hall, Bethnal Green on 9th December.

Meanwhile, smaller classes are regularly held at gyms across the capital and other parts of the UK.

And while those who attend group workouts will attest it's more fun trying to whirl a hoop round your waist while in the company of your friends, you can of course gain the benefits of hula hooping by doing it in your own home.

In the swing of it: This month's pop up events were so popular another is planned in December

All you need is a hoop - that can be bought weighted for a more intense work out - and enough room to swing.

Master the technique and you'll get an all body workout strengthening your abs and core, improving your flexibility and raising your heart rate.

As a result, a study by the American Council of Exercise (ACE) found that more than 400 calories can be burned in an hour by hula hooping.

John Porcari, one of the researchers who worked on the ACE study concluded: 'Hooping compares pretty favourably with most other group classes, in terms of heart rate and calorie burn.'

He added: 'Before we did the study, I didn't imagine the heart-rate averages would be so high. I was really impressed by how intense of a workout you can get hooping and how many calories you can burn.'

The Only Way Is Essex star Lucy Mecklenburgh told the MailOnline earlier this year that she's 'hooked' on hula hooping after taking up a regular class similar to the Fitness Freak pop up that involves combining hula moves to music.

She said: 'I loved hula hooping as a child but I'd completely forgotten how much fun it is '"Dance hooping" takes it to a whole new level and it works out my entire body out, strengthening my core and burning calories as well as, if not better than, any other boring exercise.'

Meanwhile Kelly Osbourne Tweeted in May that she's a happy hula in her home. 'All about hula-hooping right now!' she wrote. 'Five mins in the morning, five mins at night...'
