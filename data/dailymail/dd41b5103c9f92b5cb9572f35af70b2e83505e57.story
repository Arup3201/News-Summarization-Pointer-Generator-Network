Mr Stojanovic said that living with the dead isn't as scary as some might think. He said: 'I was afraid in the beginning, but I got used to it in time. Now I am more afraid of the living than of the dead

'Whenever I want to crawl out I first check if there's someone around, otherwise I could scare a person to death.

'People are very kind to me, they sometimes bring me food or clothes.

'Sometimes
 I have to get my food from rubbish bins but it can be very nutritious. 
It's amazing what people throw away," he explained.

'It doesn't frighten me to sleep in a grave. The dead are dead. I'm more frightened of being hungry.
