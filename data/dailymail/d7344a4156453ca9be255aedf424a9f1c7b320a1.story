Devastated teenager Shannon Graham, left reeling by the news that her boyfriend Recep Cetin is said to have confessed to stabbing her mother and friend Kathy to death, returned with her father Raymond McGuinness to the villa they all shared together in Turkey.

Wearing a green vest top and floral 
shorts and also accompanied by her brother, Shannon packed the last 
remnants of her life in the villa at Korukent, Kusadasi, which Cetin rented 
in May.

The bereaved family were calm but made no comment as they quietly packed suitcases, laptops and bags into a waiting car.

Painful return: Shannon Graham, head bowed, and her father Raymond McGuinness pack up the home she shared with her mother Marion, Kathy Dinsmore and their killer, Recep Cetin

Solemn: Neither Shannon nor any of her family members made a comment as they packed up their belongings

Accused: Recep Cetin with 15-year-old Shannon. He wanted to marry her and start a new life in Ireland

Recep Cetin allegedly drove the two women to a forest and killed them

The Turkish waiter who allegedly
murdered the two British women in a frenzied knife attack is said to have told police: 'They
stole my dream - that's why I killed them.'

Recep Cetin, 17, arrested for the killing of his girlfriend's mother, Marion Graham, 53, and her 
friend, Kathy Dinsmore, 53, is said to have confessed after eight-and-a-half hours of 
questioning.

He told 
Turkish police that he'd planned to marry his Irish girlfriend Shannon 
Graham, 15, and dreamed of starting a new life together in Ireland.

Those dreams were shattered when Shannon's mother Marion flatly refused to give her permission for the match.

After a last attempt to persuade 
Marion to change her mind furious body-builder Cetin allegedly slashed and stabbed
her more than 15 times in a remote forest near Izmir in Turkey on Thursday.

According to police horrified Kathy 
Dinsmore tried to flee the bloodbath but Cetin hunted her down and dealt
her the same savage fate.

The bodies of the two friends were found 20 
metres apart where Kathy was cut down as she tried to make a run for 
it.  Both women were stabbed more than 15 times in the chest and both 
had the knife plunged into their neck.

Shared: The house in Korukent, Kusadasi, where they all lived

Neighbours on the quiet estate where they family lived said 
that Cetin and the Irish women had furious rows on a daily basis. The 
Turkish next-door neighbours even stopped their children walking past the
three-storey villa - disturbed by the screaming, shouting and slapping 
that constantly echoed from the house.

It was after a particularly furious 
row last week which saw Cetin kick Shannon that her mother Marion insisted 
she was taking Shannon home, effectively ending the turbulent 
relationship with Cetin.

Cetin swore that he would kill her if she interfered and he was apparently  true to his word.

Initially, Cetin, who dropped out of 
school at 12, concocted an elaborate alibi in the hope that he'd removed
the only obstacle to his plans for a future with Shannon.

After allegedly hacking her mother to death, Cetin returned 70 miles to his home in Kusadasi where he lay on 
the ground outside the villa feigning unconsciousness.

His Turkish neighbours, who asked not 
to be named, said: ‘We saw him lying in the dirt outside his house on 
Thursday afternoon. He was covered in mud and had a cut to his hand but 
the blood had dried.

‘We went over to him and offered to 
call an ambulance but he came to and told us he'd take a taxi to 
hospital. On his way he dumped a bag in the rubbish bins. At that point 
we had no idea what he'd done.'

Recep Cetin is said to have confessed to the double murder after eight and a half hours in custody

Shannon arrived home from a boat trip to find Cetin cut and covered in dirt in the garden.

He told her that while in the forest 
in Izmir a black van pulled up and three men jumped out and abducted her
mother and Kathy. Cetin claimed that he put up a fight to defend the women
and was cut and knocked out in the ensuing struggle.

But his implausible alibi fell apart 
when he added that having been knocked out in the forest in Izmir he 
woke in his garden in Kusadasi - and had no idea how he 
got there.

Shannon immediately raised the alarm 
and police, who initially fell for the story, allowed Cetin to go 
to hospital by taxi to get his injured hand bandaged.

But it didn't take them long to pull 
apart the pack of lies that Cetin spun. After just eight and a half hours in custody 
Cetin is said to have confessed to the killing, blaming the women for stealing his dream
future.

Marion's ex-husband, Yucel Kilinc, a 
Turkish waiter 10 years her junior, said yesterday: ‘Marion and I 
married five years ago but we always argued and just couldn't make it 
work so we separated three years ago.

‘When I heard what happened I was shocked and horrified. I just don't understand how this could have happened.’

Having packed her belongings Shannon 
and her family left Korukent - although neighbours say she has returned on
a daily basis since the murders to feed and walk her puppy.

The family are believed to be staying 
in Turkey until they can return home with the bodies of the two dead 
women later this week.
