Outlaw Rebels bikies have been accused of drugging and raping underage girls at a clubhouse on Queensland's Fraser Coast, north of Brisbane.

Police are investigating multiple reports alleging gang members sexually assaulted girls under 16 years old at the Rebels Hervey Bay clubhouse before it was destroyed in a fire last year.

It is believed some of the girls were paid for sex in drugs, while others were drugged before they unknowingly had sex with the bikies, said Detective Inspector Bruce McNab.

'The information we have is that the attacks were very traumatic for the young girls,' he told AAP.

'It would have been extremely traumatic and degrading for them,' he said.

'Members of that criminal organisation were taking underage girls back to the clubhouse for the purposes of having sex with them.'

Police fear the girls may have been too scared to report the assaults to authorities because of the bikes' standover tactics.

It is alleged the Rebels Hervey Bay clubhouse was where the assaults took place, before it was destroyed in a fire last year

The alleged attacks became known to police following the introduction of Queensland's anti-gang laws.

The legislation offers incentives to the public for dobbing in outlaw bikies.

Police have received reports from multiple sources, but urge anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
