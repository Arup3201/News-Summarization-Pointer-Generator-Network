A mother was left disgusted after her son bit into a Waitrose cupcake and nearly ate a dead wasp.

Sue Weightman, 52, bought the £1.99 pack of four treats for Alex’s 22nd birthday.

She was stunned when the civil servant apprentice took a bite out of the toffee and banana flavoured cupcake and found a wasp under the frosting.

Disgusting: Sue Weightman, 52, bought the £1.99 pack of four treats for Alex’s 22nd birthday and discovered this wasp in the icing of one of the cakes which she bought from Little Waitrose in Nottingham

Miss Weightman, who lives in Beeston, Nottingham, with son Alex, 22, and daughter Anna-Marie, 18, bought the cakes from the Little Waitrose store in Nottingham city centre.

She said: 'There was one cake for me, one for my ex-husband, and one each for the two children.

'The next day we had a party at home and me and my daughter went to prepare the food.

'Alex bit into it and found a wasp inside the icing. He refused to have any more food. It sent shudders to my stomach, it made me feel really ill and totally upset me.

'Having this party tea was important to me and it birthdays are meant to be special. I’m not happy. I expected good standards from Waitrose but I won’t ever be shopping there again.'

Miss Weightman, who works as a cleaner, went back to the Waitrose store to complain and the company has since apologised.

They also gave Alex a £100 voucher to use at Waitrose or in any John Lewis store.

A spokeswoman for the company said: 'We take customer safety very seriously and are very sorry for any distress caused.

'Although this is an isolated incident we are investigating with our branch and our suppliers how this could have happened.

'We have personally apologised to the customer and will inform her of the results of the investigation.'

But Miss Weightman added: 'We want to know if it was malicious or whether it could’ve just dropped down in the atmosphere. They need to learn from this.

'I do not want anybody else being made poorly from something like this.'

Investigation: Little Waitrose in Nottingham City Centre has apologised for the 'isolated incident'. A spokesman said they were liaising with suppliers
