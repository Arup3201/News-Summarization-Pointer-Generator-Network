As New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez is handed a season ban for 2014, 60 Minutes has examined the doping charges leveled against him.

In a show due to be broadcast on CBS on Sunday, the chief witness against A-Rod in the MLB case will claim he injected the player with banned substances.

Although A-Rod declined to take part in the CBS show, Anthony Bosch will feature alongside Major League Baseball's Rob Manfred.

Claims: Biogenesis founder Anthony Bosch alleged on 60 Minutes that he injected A-Rod with drugs

The drug charges made against A-Rod led originally to a 211-game suspension, but that was lowered on Saturday.

The baseball player has denied using banned substances while at the Yankees and never tested positive for drugs while on the team.

However, in 60 Minutes, Bosch alleges that he injected testosterone, insulin-like growth factor 1 and a human growth hormone in A-Rod at least a dozen times.

'Alex is scared of needles, so at times, he would ask me to inject,' he claimed, adding that the player paid him $12,000 a month.

Biogenesis founder Bosch alleged that A-Rod had asked him what he gave his former client and MLB player Manny Ramirez, as the New York Yankee tried to achieve his dream of 800 home runs.

Text messages between A-Rod and Bosch, that were seen by 60 Minutes, show that at times the pair were in contact daily.

Bosch went on to claim that A-Rod's associates tried to intimidate him in an effort to prevent him from helping with the MLB investigation into the player.

Investigation: Bosch is interviewed about the allegations on 60 Minutes

Manfred told the show the alleged threats appeared credible, 'particularly given that he identified 
individuals that we had our own concerns about'.

Bosch had originally denied giving players performance-enhancing drugs but he later started to co-operate with the investigation.

The MLB dropped its lawsuit against Bosch and is paying for his security guards and legal fees.

The arrangement has been described as a $5 million bribe by A-Rod in his own lawsuit against the MLB - a charge that Manfred has denied.

The 38-year-old player has denied the doping claims, issuing a statement on Saturday that read: 'I have been clear that I did not use performance enhancing substances as alleged in the notice of discipline, or violate the Basic Agreement or the Joint Drug Agreement in any manner, and in order to prove it I will take this fight to federal court.'
