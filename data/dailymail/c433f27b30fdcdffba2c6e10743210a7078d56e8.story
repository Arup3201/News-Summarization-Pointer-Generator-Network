At least five people have died and 52 have been injured - many believed to be civilians - following an air strike by the Kenyan air force on a displaced persons camp in Somalia.

The Kenyan military today confirmed that they had conducted the attack over Jilib, between Mogadishu south to Kismayo , yesterday, and said that 10 al Shabaab insurgents - the intended targets - had been killed.

Spokesman Emmanuel Chirchir denied that civilian blood had been spilled, and claimed contrary reports were propaganda from the Islamist insurgent group.

He said: 'We
bombed an Al-Shebab camp, killed 10 and wounded 47.

'We are sure about this assessment, no 
collateral damage, no women, no children.'

However aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) indicated that most of those injured were women and children.

'Our staff said that around 52 people, all civilians, mostly women and children, had been wounded and that three were dead,' Gautam Chatterjee, Head of Mission for MSF Holland in Somalia, said.

'In our hospital in Marare, we received 31 children, nine women and five men. All of them of with shrapnel injuries.'

He said MSF staff in the region were 'treating dozens of injured following an aerial bombardment on the town of Jilib that hit a camp for internally-displaced people at around 1.30pm (11.30am GMT) on Sunday'.

Three children, one man and one 
woman had been killed in the aerial bombardment, witnessed by MSF 
employees in a camp that is home to 1,500 households, added Mr Chatterjee.

He declined to comment on 
Kenyan military denials of any civilian casualties in Jibil, saying he 
could only give details of the patients MSF had received for treatment.

On October 17 Kenya's foreign minister, Moses Masika Wetangula, revealed that he had sent troops into neighbouring Somalia in order to target al Shabaab.

Mr Wetangula said Kenya was defending itself following a spate of kisnappings believed to have been masterminded by the Islamist militant group.

Eye-witnesses described seeing dozens of military vehicles trundling over the border, along with planes and helicopters.

Al Shabaab leaders, who deny carrying out the kidnapping, have fortified their ranks in preparation for the attacks.

And al Shabaab spokesman Ali Mohamud Rage told the BBC Somali service: 'We will defend ourselves.

'Kenya doesn't know war. We know war. The tall buildings in Nairobi will be destroyed.

'We have fought against governments older and stronger than Kenya and we have defeated them.'

He said MSF had now evacuated its team from Jilib so a distribution of rations planned for today had been postponed.

In addition, Doctors Without Borders said at least three were killed in the air raid on the camp, which houses some 9,000 internally displaced people.

Further, witnesses at the camp in Jilib, the most populous town in the Middle Juba Region, spoke of up to five victims dying following the strike.

'One of the bombs exploded near a camp where suspected members of the al Shabaab were distributing food to displaced families,' local resident Abdikadim said.

'Several people died on the spot, I saw three of them.'

Moalim Isak, another witness, said: 'At least four powerful blasts were heard inside and outside Jilib this afternoon and at least five civilians were killed when one of the bombs smashed into an aid distribution centre.'

Kenya moved its troops into neighbouring Somalia a fortnight in pursuit of the Somali insurgents it blames for a series of kidnappings on Kenyan soil and frequent assaults on its security forces in the border province of North Eastern.

The first serious clash between Kenyan troops and al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab insurgents was last Thursday.

Kenya said it killed nine rebels and one Kenyan soldier who had been wounded in the insurgent ambush subsequently died.

Abdiwelli Mohammed Ali, the Somali prime minister, earlier said: 'I doubt the Kenyans did this. Even if that's the case, I doubt that they have done this on purpose.

'The Kenyans wouldn't target Internally displaced persons (IDPs). But if that happened, then it's an unfortunate incident. But the fight is not towards this IDPs, the fight was towards the al-Shabab who are a common enemy for both of us.

'They are an enemy for the Somalis and Kenyans. So that's where our focus is and that's where our target is.'
