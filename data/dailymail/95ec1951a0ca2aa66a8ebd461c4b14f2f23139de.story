Corinne Budinger, 52, had to bury her baby son Joseph three times after a series of police errors

A grieving mother has told how she had to bury her baby son three times after police twice failed to give her all of his body parts.

Corinne Budinger's baby, Joseph Mackin, was six months old when he was shaken to death by registered childminder, Helen Stacey, in 1997.

Stacey, a former prostitute, was found guilty of murdering Joseph and sentenced to life in prison.

Mrs Budinger, 52, then of North Walsham, Norfolk, had to cope with the horror of Joseph's funeral and burial, and then Stacey's trial, before she moved to Suffolk to start a new life. 

But in April 2012 the bereaved mother received a surprise visit from officers from Norfolk Police, who told her they had failed to give her all of her son's body parts.

Traumatised, Mrs Budinger and her family had to go through a second funeral and burial for her baby son.

But some months later, Norfolk Police officers came calling again, saying they still held the baby's liver and some body tissues.  Yet again, Mrs Budinger had to organise a funeral and burial for Joseph.

Today she told The Sun: 'No mother should have to bury their baby three times.

'When the officers visited me out of the blue I had to sit down, I felt so ill.  When they turned up again, that was enough to send me over the edge.'

Mrs Budinger, who now lives in Ipswich, said she could not believe what police were telling her when they turned up the second time. 

She said she began suffering panic attacks and had to quit her job as a result.

Mrs Budinger sued Norfolk Police and, in January this year, received damages and an apology from Norfolk Deputy Chief Constable, Charlie Hall.

Meanwhile in 2001 Stacey, a former prostitute, had her conviction for murder reduced to manslaughter on appeal, and her sentence reduced to seven years.

The original trial had heard how Joseph's parents had dropped off their son at the home of Stacey, who had convictions for soliciting and shoplifting, at 7am.

Joseph was found 'floppy like a rag doll' after he was left with childminder, Helen Stacey, and died that day

Childminder Helen Stacey, left, was jailed after she was convicted of murdering baby Joseph, right with his sister, Samantha, though her conviction was later reduced to manslaughter on appeal in 2001

He was found 'floppy like a rag doll' at 5.15pm and died the same day in 1997. 

The jury at Norwich Crown Court heard that baby Joseph had was shaken by Stacey, now 57, in a fit of temper, suffering a serious brain injury which led to his death.

Stacey's murder conviction was quashed and replaced with one for manslaughter after the Court of Appeal heard that Stacey had not intended to do serious harm to the child.

Stacey, who had been registered as a childminder by social services even though three of her four children had been taken into care or adopted, was convicted on evidence that she had violently shaken Joseph.
