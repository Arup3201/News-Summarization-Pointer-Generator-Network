Former soldier Jeremy Green, 26, was sentenced to life in prison today after admitting murder and attempted murder

A former Army officer who killed an estate agent after imprisoning her and her flatmate for hours while he tortured them has been jailed for life.

Jeremy Green, 26, held 32-year-old Nicole Waterhouse and 23-year-old Karen Browne hostage while he tortured them, stabbing them and slashing their throats.

Miss Waterhouse died as a result of the attack at the York flat, while Miss Browne, who worked with Miss Waterhouse at Hunters Estate Agents, suffered devastating injuries.

Miss Waterhouse's family sobbed in court today as they told how Green had 'destroyed all of our lives'.

Green, a graduate of Sandhurst Military Academy who had served with the Yorkshire Regiment in Afghanistan, was sentenced to ilfe in jail today after admitting murder and attempted murder.

Leeds Crown Court heard that Green had dated Miss Browne briefly, but the relationship had ended before he turned up at the flat the two women shared in York one Sunday morning last autumn.

Green arrived at around 10am on 20 October and went into Miss Browne's bedroom where he attacked her.  Despite Miss Browne shouting to her flatmate: 'Get out or get help', Miss Waterhouse went to her friend's assistance.

The court heard that Green did not leave the flat for nearly nine hours, during which time he attacked and tortured both women, drinking beer as they suffered in separate bedrooms.

Before he left he took money and mobile phones from the women, and left Miss Waterhouse with 65 injuries and Miss Browne with 19.

He had tried to suffocate Miss Browne three times, strangled her with a belt, cut her throat three times with a piece of glass and left her with two deflated lungs and a serious injury to her spinal cord.

As a result of the injury to her spine she was unable to move, and was forced to listen as her friend screamed through the walls as Green attacked her.

Miss Waterhouse, known as Nicki to her 
friends, had been smothered, stabbed and had her throat slashed more 
than once. She was found naked.

The court heard the former soldier, who gave no reason for the attacks, used a pillow to press on Miss Browne's stomach to speed up the blood flow and hasten her death.

During his time in the flat, unemployed Green, who had money problems, contacted both victims' families using their mobile phones, making it appear that they were on dates or running out of battery.  He also contacted other women via his phone - women who later said he seemed 'perfectly normal'.

After killing Miss Waterhouse and thinking he had killed Miss Browne, Green took their phones, bank cards and jewellery and left the flat.

Although no weapon was found, Green later told police he had used a lock knife he had got while serving in Afghanistan.

Prosecutor, Peter Moulson QC said Green told police 'He was a former soldier, and following the attack on Lee Rigby he felt he had to arm himself at all times'.

Green gave no explanation for the attack, and psychiatrists who examined him could find nothing wrong

He said Green had gone to the flat thinking both women would be out and intending to burgle it, but after conning his way into the building decided to rob them when he found them in their bedrooms.

The court heard that Green, who was courtmartialled and dismissed from the Army last April for stealing, was short of money.  He withdrew cash using both victimsâ€™ cash cards when he left the flat, before going to a supermarket and buying food.

But Mr Moulson said psychiatrists had examined him and found nothing that could explain his actions.

Green, of York, who sat in the glass-fronted dock dressed in a suit, looked down as the women's relatives addressed him.

Miss Waterhouse's sister, Danielle, stared straight at him and said: 'I will always have three sisters and no-one will take them away from me - not even him.

'He's destroyed all our lives and he's taken a part of our family we can never replace.  My heart aches knowing she died alone with no-one around her.'

Miss Waterhouse's estate agent father, John, stopped repeatedly to wipe tears from his eyes as he read out his statement facing Green, saying: 'She was totally conned by this man's evilness.'

Sentencing Green to life in prison with a minimum of 33 years and 198 days, the Recorder of Leeds, Judge Peter Collier, QC, said:  'Your final savagery to each of them is almost beyond belief.'

'Throughout the day you engaged in the most appalling and prolonged series of attacks on these young women.

'They
 were completely at your mercy. Apart from being physically stronger 
then them, you were armed throughout with a knife and you also armed 
yourself with other weapons - a belt, a bottle.

'It
 is impossible to imagine the torment to which they were both subjected 
and the terror they experienced over those long hours.'

Judge Collier also sentenced Green to 24 years in prison for the attempted murder of Miss Browne, to run concurrently with his life sentence.

Speaking outside court, Miss Waterhouse's father said: 'Our love for each other will help us to continue without her. We will always love Nicki and we will never forget her.'
