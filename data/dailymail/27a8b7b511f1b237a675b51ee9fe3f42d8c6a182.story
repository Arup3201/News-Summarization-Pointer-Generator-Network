Tottenham have turned to a familiar face in Gareth Bale to help their Premier League plight... or so it looks like!

Spurs have recalled winger Kenny McEvoy from his season-long loan with Peterborough United, the League One club have confirmed.

The 20-year-old is a dead-ringer for Bale and plays on the wing too like the former White Hart Lane favourite.

However, sadly for Tottenham fans that is where the similarities between the duo ends at present with McEvoy yet to make a first-team outing for the club.

In contrast Bale has gone from strength to strength at Real Madrid winning three trophies already with the Spanish giants following his world-record £86million move from north London last year.

And while Mauricio Pochettino would dearly love to be able to call on the talents of Wales international, the decision to recall McEvoy highlights the club's struggles domestically as they languish in 12th position.

The Republic of Ireland Under 21s international scored once in eight appearances for Peterborough, netting the opener in the Posh's 3-2 win over MK Dons in August.

In a statement on the club's official website, Peterborough thanked McEvoy for his efforts during his two months at London Road.

'We would like to thank Kenny for his efforts and wish him the best of luck in his career," it reads.
