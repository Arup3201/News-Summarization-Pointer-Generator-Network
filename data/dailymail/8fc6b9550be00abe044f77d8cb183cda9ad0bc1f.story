A man who was jailed for torturing and murdering a father is now free to stay with his family - just a mile from the victim's daughter.

Terence Haddow, 68, who killed Kevin Bruce in 2002 in Edinburgh, has been given a first term release, which allows him out of prison for five days at a time.

The victim's daughter Julie, 25, who was 13 when her father died, said the news was a 'kick in the stomach'.

Haddow and Sturgeon were jailed for life with a minimum tariff of 14 years at the High Court in Edinburgh.

Mr Bruce was beaten, had his cheeks slashed and his feet torn apart by a cheese grater by Haddow and Gordon Sturgeon.

The 38-year-old's injuries were so severe pathologists doing the post-mortem lost count of the wounds, while a detective said they were the most horrific he had ever seen.

They carried out the attack after a claim by Haddow’s girlfriend, Sharon Mortimer, that Mr Bruce had molested her.

During the three-day ordeal the attackers took Mr Bruce to get his benefits payments so they could buy alcohol.

Ms Bruce, 25, from Edinburgh, told the Daily Record: 'My dad won’t be able to give me away at my wedding, he won’t meet his grandchildren and he will never be there for me because of the evil actions of these two men.

'He was in excruciating pain before he died, and now one of them is allowed to pop out of prison to see his family.

'It doesn’t seem fair. I feel the justice system has failed me.'

Her parents split when she was 10, but Ms Bruce would see her father, who she described as a 'kind, lovely man', every week.

The administrator discovered that Haddow would be allowed out of prison after signing the victim notification scheme. She now fears bumping into him in the street if he goes back to his last known address, just a mile from her home.

Ms Bruce has also called for a change in the law so a life sentence actually means life in prison.

A Scottish Prison Service spokeswoman said: 'The granting of temporary release on licence conditions is an integral part of preparing long-term prisoners for returning to their communities and loved ones upon release.

'Each individual who begins the process is subject to rigorous risk assessment at each stage of progression.

'Any breach of licence immediately results in a return to closed conditions and a removal of community-based privileges.'
