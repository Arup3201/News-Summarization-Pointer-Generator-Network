A police chief's daughter accused of joining in with male friends in violently bashing two Philadelphia gay men appears to have a long history of questionable social media behavior.

A Twitter account reportedly belonging to Kathryn Knott reveals the 24-year-old emergency medical technician's propensity for bashing not just gays, but also sick patients and her own liver.

Tweets on the account, which was opened in 2011 and features thousands of posts, have hastags such as '#gay #ew,' and 'Why do Asians always put their kids on a leash' among other potentially incriminating messages.

Liked to tweet: Kathryn Knott is accused of being a part of a brutal gay bashing in Philadelphia and has an active social media presence that reveals a propensity toward drinking and ridiculing others

'#gay #ew': Some of the messages could reveal a dislike for gay people, though the 24-year-old denies having played any role in the beating of the couple on September 11

Though some years old, the tweets show a person very accustomed to the risks of overindulgence. Authorities say the group members involved in this months attack were potentially intoxicated

Suspended: A medical ethics expert told Philly.com that Knott's frequent tweets about patients at the Pennsylvania hospital where she worked could make her a liability and cost her job, from which she's already been suspended

Knott and two male friends have been charged for allegedly brutally beating a gay couple in Philadelphia after internet sleuths helped cops identify them.

Knott, the  daughter of Chalfont Police Chief Karl Knott, Philip Williams, 24, and Kevin Harrigan, 26, turned themselves into Philadelphia Police early on Wednesday.

The student-turned-medical tech has a lot to say about her binge drinking in addition to a nearly daily stream of complaints about the patients who come in dire need to the emergency room where she works.

'Ended my night spreading a** cheeks to suture her hemorrhoids while they pulsated blood all over me #disgusting #arewekidding?' she wrote in August 2012. 

It's one insensitive tweet among many that sometimes also include photos of patient x-rays and even body parts.

The Philadelphia Police Department took this mugshot of Kathryn G. Knott and released it late Wednesday

Some of the tweets are merely in poor taste, while others could end up costing Knott her job, experts say

Tasteless: The account @kathryn_knott hasn't been used since last October, but since 2011 racked up some 2,500 tweets

'A patient gave me a bag of ice with his two fingers in it!' she wrote, along with a photo of what is presumably a bag of fingers.

This is the same Twitter user who brags about frequent drunkenness.

'We just got banned from the bar in HIlton Head,' she wrote in March 2012. 'When will I learn to stop drinking whiskey,' she wrote later that year.

There are glimpses of a potential dislike for gay people, as well.

'Jazz flute is for little fairy boys,' she once wrote. As well as: 'the ppl we were just dancing with just turned and mafe out with eatch other #gay #ew.'  

Surrendered: Katheryn Knott, the daughter of a Philadelphia-area police chief, has turned herself into cops for allegedly being part of a group that viciously beat up a gay couple two weeks ago

While most of these tweets are merely in questionable taste, Medical ethicist Art Caplan told Philly.com that the divulged patient info could cost Knott her job.

'I think she could be looking at legal liability,' Caplan said. 'If there's enough information in the tweets for others to deduce who's being discussed, that's a clear HIPAA violation.'

Knott has been suspended from her position at Lansdale Hospital in Pennsylvania. 

In the mean time, prosecutors said the trio face criminal conspiracy, aggravated and simple assault and reckless endangerment charges for their alleged part in the vicious beating.

They were allegedly part of a group that approached a gay couple, aged 26 and 28, in Center City on the evening of September 11 and said to one of the men: 'Is that your f***ing boyfriend?'

The group then proceeded to beat up the men, leaving them bruised and hospitalized. One of the men needed to have his jaw wired shut.

The case gained national attention when police posted a video of the well-dressed suspects and online sleuths identified them by matching the footage with photos taken in nearby restaurants and shared online.

On Wednesday, Williams' attorney Fortunato Perri Jr. told reporters that the case was not related to sexual orientation, but was instead a 'mutual confrontation' in which his client 'was not the aggressor'.

Knott's attorney Louis Busico has also denied that the dispute was motivated by anti-gay bias and said his client neither threw any punches nor hurled any insults.

'My client played no role in this,' Busico told reporters on Wednesday. 

As well as the three suspects, each of whom was photographed in a mugshot released by the police, another allegedly member of the group - who has not been arrested - has been fired from his job as a Catholic high school basketball coach. 

Fran McGlinn, 25, was said to be among the dozen men and women when the group launched the attack on the couple.

Kenneth Gavin, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, told the Daily News that McGlinn has been fired and prohibited from working at any archdiocesan school.

Party-goer: Knott's attorney said she did not throw any punches or yell anything at the men during the fight

Night out: The group were caught on surveillance footage the night they allegedly beat up the two men

Gavin said that McGlinn had been serving as a coach on a 'contract basis' at the high school and was not a teacher. 

District Attorney Seth Williams said on Tuesday in announcing the charges that the case 'shocked the entire country'.

'An assault on people because of their sexual orientation has no place in Philadelphia,' he said.

The trio have now been released on bail.

KYW-TV reports that they left the police department's Central Detectives division at about 3:30 a.m. Thursday.

Court documents indicate that Williams and Harrigan posted $75,000 bail and Knott posted $50,000 bail.  

Police had previously thanked members of the public for helping them track down suspects after they posted surveillance footage of the group online.

One internet sleuth posted an image of the group he had received from a 'friend of a friend of a friend' showing the group dining out at a restaurant that evening. 

Caught: Internet sleuths then uncovered this photo of the same group out at a restaurant, leading them to identify some of the members. Cops thanked the internet users for working so swiftly

Kicked out: Fran McGlinn, 25, pictured left and right, has been fired from his job as a basketball coach at a Catholic high school after he allegedly featured in the video. He has not been arrested

Others identified the restaurant as La Viola and then another member of the public found out who had 'checked in' to the restaurant on Facebook - and matched the profiles with the group picture. 

He then contacted authorities with a list of names. 

Pennsylvania's hate-crimes law does not cover crimes motivated by a person's sexual orientation. Under current law, a hate crime includes incidents motivated by race, ethnicity, or religion.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, along with openly gay state Rep. Brian Sims of Philadelphia and others, have said the case illustrates the need for a change in the law.
