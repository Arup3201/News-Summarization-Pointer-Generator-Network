Robbie Keane says he feels better now than he has in years — and admits it is all down to an  operation he should have had long ago.

The Republic of Ireland skipper had surgery to tidy up his Achilles tendons last November, at the end of the MLS season, but says he wishes it had been done before the Euro 2012 finals.

Keane checked in for international duty on Thursday night with a pep in his step and words of encouragement for Irish manager Martin O’Neill.

Veteran: Robbie Keane is feeling back to his best again after an operation on his achilles

‘This is the best I’ve felt in a long, long time,’ said Ireland’s record goal-scorer.

‘I wish I had it (the operation) done a couple of years ago. It’s a huge difference not just playing but just in general, just walking about and stuff. Waking up in the morning, it’s taken me five seconds to go to the toilet instead of 20 minutes,’ he joked.

Keane hasn’t missed a game for LA Galaxy this season and his fine club form is a positive for Ireland ahead of the Euro qualifiers.

Martin O’Neill plans to make four changes from 
the team which drew Italy 0-0 in London on Saturday night for Ireland’s 
first engagement with the World Cup outsiders from Central America.

Forde; Kelly,  R Keogh, Pearce, Wilson; Pilkington, Whelan, Quinn, 
McClean; Keane; Doyle.

Keane has only played once under O’Neill, against Latvia last November, and is eager to land running against Costa Rica in Philadelphia later on Friday night.

‘Of course you miss it, you certainly do, but I knew what the case was. I was going to come in for the two games and I’m excited to be here,’ he said.

With only five strikers in Europe ahead of him on the all-time international list, Keane retains his zest for goals.

‘It’s the same pressure as I’ve had since I was 17, so that will never change. I’m going to put pressure on myself more than probably you guys do,’ he said to the media.

‘My job is to score goals but listen, it doesn’t matter if I score goals or if it’s Shane (Long) or Wes (Hoolahan) or whoever it is among the other strikers. The important thing is winning games and certainly if we can score more goals than the opposition then we have a good chance.’

Ever-present: Keane hasn't missed a game for LA Galaxy so far this season

Goals have been in short supply for Ireland in Keane’s absence — just two in four games — but Keane isn’t perturbed by the dearth.

‘I know there’s been talk about that but as long as players are getting the opportunities to score, that’s always good.

‘We’ve got strikers in the squad who are quite capable of scoring. At the end you want to finish the chances, and if I can help to contribute towards that, then great.’

With Roy Keane keeping away from the media gaze, the younger Keane took centre stage in Manhattan. He didn’t flinch when asked about the recent Roy kerkuffle.

‘I heard the manager saying today that it’s done now, he’s here, we’ll move on. As a group, we’re delighted that he’s staying.

Legendary: Keane is Ireland's all-time record goalscorer with 62 goals in 131 appearances to date

‘He (Keane) has been good since he’s come in. We’ve enjoyed him being in the group,’ he said.

O’Neill is uplifted by the arrival of his captain, especially with so many established players missing out. And O’Neill sees no sense of Keane’s enthusiasm diminishing after 132 caps spread over 16 years and is eager to keep him involved.

‘He has been a quality centre forward for some considerable length of time. Obviously, as he gets a wee bit older maybe he has to adjust his game in certain aspects. We will try to adjust ourselves to him.

‘He has just arrived so we have not formulated a plan just to accommodate him. He is easy and as long as he knows what his role is in the team, which he does, then the rest (is) straight forward.’
