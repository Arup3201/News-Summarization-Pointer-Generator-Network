Nigel Pearson appeared to tell one of his own supporters to 'f*** off and die' in shocking footage that has emerged from Leicester City's defeat by Liverpool.

The Foxes have already launched an investigation into the incident which has dominated the headlines since Tuesday's game at the King Power Stadium - and now an astonishing video of the spat has been released.

Pearson is expected to use Friday's scheduled press conference to apologise for any offence caused by the flashpoint, which came next to the tunnel after he left his customary seat in the stands for the final few minutes.

In the immediate aftermath of the defeat Pearson admitted to a ‘spat’ saying: ‘I replied to one idiot in the stands and if he doesn’t like what he sees, then don’t bother coming.’ 

He then added: ‘Maybe they ought to think about staying at home. We’ve worked hard and will continue to do so. I don’t like the commitment of my players being questioned.’

When contacted by Sportsmail, Leicester declined to comment on the incident. 

Foxes Supporters Club chairman Cliff Ginnetta also believes Pearson should apologise, pointing out the manager's perceived arrogance.

'He should put his hands up, admit he was out of order, apologise to the people and move on, that’s all everyone wants,' Ginetta said.

'We don’t want to make it a big thing or play it out like a pantomime, we just want to get on with winning games.

'I’m sure the majority do (still support him), people are worried and moaning but that’s football fans, you’re never really happy. It’s the nature of the beast.

'He is popular but this arrogance spills over sometimes.'

Leicester took the lead after Leonardo Ulloa shot rebounded off the post and in off Simon Mignolet's back

Pearson was already under severe pressure before the footage emerged due to the fact Leicester sit bottom of the Premier League.

They have failed to win any of their last nine matches and are in a perilous position.

Goals from Adam Lallana, Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson downed the Foxes on Tuesday night.

And this despite Leonardo Ulloa's shot which came back off Simon Mignolet having given Leicester an early lead.

This footage of an alleged expletive-filled tirade with a one of his own supporters will only heighten the pressure on the Foxes boss. 

The advantage didn't last, though, as Adam Lallana hit back with this left-footed strike and Liverpool won
