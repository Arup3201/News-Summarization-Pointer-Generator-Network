A beauty therapist who was clinically dead for 30 minutes after suffering a cardiac arrest in bed was saved by her pet dog who howled for help.

Joanna Mellor, 24, went into cardiac arrest after going to sleep next to her boyfriend Andrew Rayment, 27.

Upon discovering she wasn't breathing, the couple's five-year-old pet Labrador, Leo, began barking.

This woke Mr Rayment, who hurriedly dialled 999 and performed CPR on his girlfriend until paramedics arrived.

Joanna Mellor, 24, suffered a cardiac arrest in her sleep, but her five-year-old dog Leo barked until her boyfriend woke up and realised she wasn't breathing

Leo barked until Miss Mellor's boyfriend Andrew woke up. Andrew dialled 999 and performed CPR on his girlfriend until paramedics came and she was rushed to hospital for life-saving treatment

In hospital, doctors said her heart had stopped for 30 minutes before Mr Rayment began CPR. She was able to make a full recovery after her cardiac arrest, something paramedics said is unheard of

Incredibly, doctors said Miss Mellor's heart had stopped for 30 minutes before Mr Rayment managed to resuscitate her.

Miss Mellor, who lives with her boyfriend in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, has since been diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.

This is a condition in which she has an extra electrical connection in the heart, causing it to beat abnormally fast, triggering a cardiac arrest.

Miraculously, she has now made a full recovery.

She said: 'I owe my life to my dog and my boyfriend. If Leo hadn't woken Andrew up I might not be here today.

'I remember going to bed and drifting off the sleep and the next I know I'm in intensive care in hospital and told I'd suffered a heart attack.

'The doctors say I was technically dead because it took Andrew 30 minutes to get my heart started.

'Andrew said he woke up with Leo barking and jumping up at my side of the bed and going mad.

'He says he could tell something was wrong with me and dialled 999 and the operator talked him through CPR.

'At first the doctors said I might be at risk of brain damage and I couldn't feel my legs and one of my hands was all limp but I've now made a full recovery.'

Miss Mellor now says she 'owes her life' to her labrador Leo and her boyfriend Andrew Rayment, 27

Miss Mellor's Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome had meant her heart began beating irregularly.

This caused a cardiac arrest, where the electrical activity of the heart becomes so chaotic that the heart stops pumping and quivers of 'fibrillates' instead. 

The heart stops pumping blood around the body, causing a person to lose consciousness and potentially die within minutes.

Mr Rayment said he woke up to barking on January 2nd this year.

He said: 'I was half asleep when Leo woke me up.

'I heard Joanna's breathing becoming erratic and I tried to wake her and tapped each side of her face, but she was unconscious so I called 999.

'My first thought was that I didn't want to waste the paramedics' time but when I was on the phone her breathing went from in and out to every few seconds.

'I tried not to panic and to stay focused. I kept thinking that the only chance she has relies on me doing the CPR properly.'

Rescue crews from East Midlands Ambulance Service dashed to the scene in under 15 minutes before rushing her to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham.

Paramedic Glenn Radford said: 'I've been on the job for 14 years and I've never seen anything like it.

'When people suffer cardiac arrests, quite often they are left with neurological problems. They don't usually make a 100 per cent recovery.'
