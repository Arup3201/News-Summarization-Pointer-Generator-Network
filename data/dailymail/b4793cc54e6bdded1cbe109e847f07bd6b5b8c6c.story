It's the elegant car that suggests a cool, calm and sophisticated driver.

However, it would appear that not every owner of an Aston Martin is as poised as 007 - as one motorist proved after he flooded his £150,000 car.

This dozy driver had a soggy Christmas after he drove into floodwater which swamped his brand new vehicle.

The four-door supercar broke down as the motorist tried to travel home through a flooded street in Maidstone, Kent, on Christmas Day.

Water, up to four-feet high in places, caused the electrics in the luxury Aston Martin Rapide to cut out, meaning the driver had no choice but to abandon his flashy motor.

The vehicle was stuck and water was seen dripping across its white leather seats and back seat TV screens.

The owner, who asked not to be named, said: ;I was just trying to get home and it conked out.I thought I'd be okay, but I wasn't.

'It's alright though, it's only a car. I'm fine, and nobody was hurt - that's the main thing.'

The cream leather interior of the supercar seemed remarkably dry, despite water reaching up over the wheel arches

Aston Martin has won worldwide fame as a great British brand that oozes class - not rainwater

After the floods, an electrical fault caused the windows to open, letting more water pour inside

Resident Adam French, 25, witnessed the whole scene from his flat overlooking the flooded street.

He said: 'That guy had no chance. I reckon the air intake must be pretty low on that car, and the whole thing just shut down.

'After a while, the windows opened, which was pretty funny, because some kids got into the car.

'He didn't seem too bothered, which was a bit strange.'

The vehicle was removed on Thursday afternoon, after the mechanic and the owner struggled to open the electric bonnet because the luxury car's bonnet was flat.

Water was seen dripping off the televisions on the back of the front seats, after the electrical fault caused the windows to open.

Aston Martin has won worldwide fame as a great British brand that oozes class, sophistication and performance.

Like many of Britain's great car-making names Aston Martin has changed hands numerous times over the years, however, it has not been plain sailing for Aston in recent years.

At the tail-end of last year, takeover talk dominated after a slowdown in sales.

Kuwaiti groups Investment Dar and Adeem Investment Co bought Aston Martin five years ago for around £500million from US car giant Ford, which had controlled the brand since 1987.

In December, it received a £150million cash injection from European investment group Investindustrial, giving it a 37.5 per cent stake in the business.

The arrival of the Italian-based investment group followed news that Aston Martin’s sales had tumbled 20 percent to 2,520 vehicles in the first nine months of 2012.

Aston Martin said the money would help deliver on a bright future tapping into rising global demand for luxury cars and, ‘proceed with its extensive and exciting plans for long-term growth and take on rivals like Porsche and Ferrari’.
