A quarter of children in the UK have never tasted a tomato and almost half have never tried lettuce. 

The shocking new statistics are a shameful insight into the daily diet of a child in the UK - a country where the government has spent millions of pounds in advertising to push the Five A Day guidelines. 

Ex-Blue Peter presenter Helen Skelton saw the human side to these figures when she toured Britain's primary schools recently as part of a campaign to get children eating healthily.

Ex-Blue Peter presenter Helen Skelton is championing new healthy eating campaign across UK's schools, where she has encountered children who had never eat fruit or vegetables. Here she is pictured with children at Berrymede Junior School in London - one of the healthier schools from the programme 

The TV star was confronted with kids who believed boiled sweets counted as fruit and others who had never eaten a vegetable in their lives.

She said: 'I was in a bubble of naivety before I started visiting these schools, I did not realise that three in ten kids have never had a banana or that four in ten kids have never had broccoli - you take that for granted.' 

Helen was taking part in the Eat Like A Champ programme, introduced to help tackle the growing issue of poor nutrition and inactive lifestyles among children. 

The project helps to teach children about eating healthily by tailor-making special lessons for children aged 9-10 that introduce fruit and vegetables into the diet. 

After taking the course to several primary schools, Helen realised that a large proportion of our population are being brought up without any access to vegetables. 

She said: 'This one little boy at school in London told me he only liked Sams, which is basically the west London equivalent of KFC.

'He said he was eating it five times a week, which is not only expensive, it's also just chicken in a bucket.

At first he was adamant that he didn’t like healthy food and only liked Sams, but I just gave him some mango and suggested he try it.

'It wasn’t about me saying, "This is healthy - eat this," I was more just saying, "try this."

'By the end of the class he was having tomatoes and soft cheese on crackers, so I watched him change his mind. 

'With another little boy, I had to dare him to even get him to eat a blueberry.

Helen Skelton first shot to fame on BBC children's show Blue Peter. The Eat Like A Champ programme makes nutrition exciting for kids by encouraging them to adopt the choices of famous champions they admire 

'By the end of the session I was watching him sneak handfuls of blueberries from behind our backs. 

'It's hard for these kids because they have never even been given the option before.  

'It’s about offering them tasty alternatives that also happen to be healthy.'

While these accounts may seem shocking, the findings from the programme have shown that these children aren't alone. 

450,000 kids in Britain have never tried any fruit or vegetables in their lifetime. 

Helen Skelton says some of the children she spoke to believed that strawberry sweets counted towards their Five A Day  

70 per cent of children have never eaten an aubergine or an avocado before, 42 per cent have never tasted a mushroom and 54 per cent have never tried celery. 

Even more worryingly, many children believe that they are actually  eating healthily because fruit-flavoured sweets count towards their five a day. 

Helen said: 'I don‘t think they realise what is a healthy choice is in a lot of cases.

'Strawberry sweets - so many kids think that counts, it’s quite sad.

'Kids think that when they eat things like strawberry tarts, that’s a great way to eat fruit when it most likely isn’t. 

'When I’d ask if they helped to cook, they’d say that they did help out in the kitchen, but not one of them mentioned fruit or vegetables.

'They’d have coco pops for breakfast and chicken curry for dinner. When I asked if they put onion in their chicken curry, they’d even say no to that.

'No kid said that they ate vegetables. Or salad.

'They even said that they take the lettuce out of their sandwiches, I mean, lettuce is just water.'

The Eat Like A Champ programme,  created by Danone in collaboration with the British Nutrition Foundation is free for schools to sign up to.
