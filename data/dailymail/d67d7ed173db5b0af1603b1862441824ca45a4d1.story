Daphne McDaniels, 24, was arrested for the murders of her two daughters nearly four months after the sisters' bodies were discovered

A mother has been charged with the murder of her two young daughters after the little girls were beaten to death at a home in Quitman, Texas.

Daphne McDaniels, 24, was arrested for the murders of one-year-old Natalye Price and Gabriella Guerrero, three, nearly four months after the sisters' bodies were discovered.

At the time, her boyfriend Thomas Liles, 19, was arrested for tampering with evidence. 

Police say he threw away drug paraphernalia  just before  the girls' battered bodies were found.

According to KLTV, the autopsy report showed that Gabriella died of multiple blunt force injuries including contusions of the head, trunk and extremities, and lacerations of the liver. 

Her sister, Natalye, suffered scalp, facial, lung and liver contusions, as well as bruises of the trunk and further injuries.

McDaniels has been living in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but she returned to Texas this week to be interrogated and was subsequently arrested and charged with two counts of capital murder. She is now being held in Wood County jail.

Former neighbors told CBS 19 they are not shocked by the arrest.

'Every night and every day, I pray for justice for these babies,' said Selma Bell, who lives just yards from the apartment where the children were found dead. 'That haunts me, it really does.'

Ms Bell claims McDaniels verbally abused the kids and she had seen bruises on their faces.

'You should love your children, not harm them if you don't want them take them to someone who will care for them the way they are supposed to be,' she added. 

In July, Child Protective Services spokesman Shari Pulliam  told KETK NBC that the agency had previously investigated McDaniels' daughter's living conditions.

In December 2013, allegations of medical and physical neglect were made at another home, where there was no running water, large amounts of trash and debris, and one of the girls had a bump on their leg that was infected.

But McDaniels was able to move into adequate and safe housing for her children during the investigation and was also able help caring for her children.

The case was completed in February 2014, KETK reported, by which time the mother was living alone with her daughters, who were in daycare while she worked.

Liles is was indicted in September and released from the Wood County jail on October 1. 

Police say that the investigation is ongoing.
