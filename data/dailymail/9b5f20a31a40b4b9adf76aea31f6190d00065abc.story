Jurors convicted an Iowa man Thursday of killing his pregnant wife after his third time on trial, rejecting his claims that an unknown intruder shot her while he was in the shower.

The jury found 23-year-old Seth Techel guilty of first-degree murder and nonconsensual termination of a human pregnancy.

The former volunteer firefighter who had once hoped for a long career in law enforcement now faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole.

Justice: Lisa Techel was killed by by her husband Seth Techel, 23, in May 2012 while she was sleeping in the mobile home they shared in Agency, near Ottumwa. She was five-months pregnant

Prosecutors argued that Techel killed 23-year-old Lisa Techel - who was five months pregnant - on May 26, 2012, so that he could be with a co-worker with whom he had been exchanging sexual text messages for months and for whom he had promised to leave his wife.

They said Techel shot his wife in their trailer in Agency, a tiny town in rural southeastern Iowa.

Lisa Techel, a county jail employee and reserve sheriff's deputy, was 17 weeks pregnant with their first child.

Techel displayed no apparent emotion at the verdict, though his parents and grandfather hung their heads in the first row of the courtroom.

Three trials: Seth Techel sits at a bond hearing in Albia, Iowa in April 2013. Techel, 23, was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of his wife, Lisa on Thursday

Lisa Techel's father, sheriff's deputy Todd Caldwell, wiped away tears after all 12 jurors said they agreed with the guilty verdicts.

Techel is scheduled to be sentenced September 15.

The texts 
between Techel and Rachel McFarland, who worked together at a job 
training center in Ottumwa, 'read like a countdown to Lisa Techel's 
death,' Prosecutor Andrew Prosser had told jurors.

He
 said the messages in which Techel promised to leave his wife to be with
 McFarland the day before the slaying gave him a powerful motive to kill
 his high school sweetheart.

Techel
 had told police that he was in the shower that May morning when he 
heard a gunshot, came out and saw his wife wounded in their bed.

He is heard on the audio of 911 calls sobbing as he says, 'my wife's been shot' and requests an ambulance.

His
 lawyers had argued that was the emotion of a man who witnessed his wife
 dying at the hands of an unknown intruder. Prosecutors suggested they 
were fake tears.

Jurors at two previous trials last year in Ottumwa and Mount Pleasant had been unable to reach a verdict.

The
 third trial was moved to the Scott County Courthouse in Davenport, 
where relatives of the defendant and victim often packed the courtroom 
during the nine-day proceeding. Jurors this time deliberated about four 
hours over two days.

Affairs: Jason Tinnes testifies during the first-degree murder trial of Seth Techel on Tuesday, July 22, 2014 in Davenport, Iowa. Tinnes admitted that he had an affair with murder victim Lisa Techel, but that he wasn't responsible for her May 2012 death

Seth Techel claims that he was in the shower when he heard a gunshot and ran down the hall to find his wife dead in their bed.

His defense argues that his wife was most likely killed by a mentally ill neighbor who has since died. Techel has downplayed the significance of the text messages to the other woman, saying their relationship wasn't serious.

Two trials last year ended with juries deadlocked and judges declaring mistrials. The first was held in Ottumwa, and the second was in Mount Pleasant. The third trial has been moved to Davenport, where the slaying has received little publicity.

Techel and his one-time high school sweetheart were both beginning careers in law enforcement under the guidance of Todd Caldwell, Lisa's father and a veteran sheriff's deputy in Wapello County.

Denied: Judge Daniel Wilson denies defense motions to dismiss the charges or declare a mistrial at the first-degree murder trial of Seth Techel, on Tuesday, July 22, 2014 in Davenport, Iowa

Techel had started working as a county jailer; his wife was a reserve deputy who had interned with the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation.

Caldwell had previously investigated the neighbor, Brian Tate, and warned deputies to use caution around him, given his mental illness.

But he has said he is convinced that Seth Techel, whom he once considered a son, is guilty in his daughter's death.

Having multiple trials in a murder case isn't that unusual, but it usually gives the prosecution an advantage, said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.

Prosecutors can better prepare to counter the anticipated defense, while multiple trials "can wear down the defense's resources and emotional energy," she said.

'While there is no guarantee of a conviction, 'third time is a charm' often applies in these cases,' she said.
