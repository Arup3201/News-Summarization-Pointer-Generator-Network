An Arizona woman has her livestream gaming to thank for authorities' rapid response to her home after armed invaders knocked down her door Monday.

People watching Nikki Elise AKA 'Sajeden' playing the game Dota 2 were nearly as surprised as the 28-year-old Tempe gamer was after hearing a crash and then watching a man with a hand gun appear to rummage through the well-known player's gaming equipment.

Sajeden is popular in Dota 2 fan circles and has a worldwide viewership on the streaming site Twitch. A friend who knew where she and her 29-year-old roommate lived happened to be watching and alerted police.

Streaming: Nikki Elise AKA Sajedene was using the website Twitch to share her gaming experience with friends worldwide when armed robbers invaded her home early Monday

Shocking: As viewers watched aghast, Sajedene reacted fearfully to two men who kicked down her door carrying guns. Luckily, at least one of the viewers knew where the 28-year-old Tempe woman lived and called police

'At that point, gamers from around the world were watching the home invasion occur while trying to contact the corresponding law enforcement agency,' Lt. Michael Pooley told KTVK.

Thanks to calls from the concerned viewers, authorities arrived so fast that they made contact with at least one of the suspects.

Pooley said one man was still in the apartment when officers arrived.

The man fled on foot but one was taken into custody after a short chase, Pooley told KTVK.

Pooley says the other man remains at large.

Nabbed: Thanks to the phone calls that poured in from concerned viewers, police arrived at the scene in time to nab one of the suspects. The other remained at large Monday

Guns or hardware? Some have suggested that the invaders were trying to steal a firearm. Here, Elise is pictured in a photo posted to Facebook in which she shows off a rifle

The suspects are both described as Hispanic. According to azfamily.com, the one still on the loose 'has scuffy facial hair and was wearing a gray shirt and black pants.'

He could still be carrying a handgun.

According to Pooley, authorities elsewhere also got calls from other people who were watching the video feed and who also saw the break-in. He said dispatchers were trying to pin down details of those calls.

Neither Elise nor her roommate, also a woman, were injured, Pooley said.
