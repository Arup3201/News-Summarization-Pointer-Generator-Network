Horrific: A 14-year-old girl was walking through a park shortly before 9pm when a boy, 15, pounced on her leaving her unconscious (file image)

A 16-year-old boy has been jailed for beating and raping a 14-year-old girl so severely that she was left in a wheelchair with the brain capacity of an eight-year-old.

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pounced on the schoolgirl as she walked through a park shortly after 9pm.

He hit her with a bottle, kicked her and raped her, leaving her unconscious. 

The girl was taken to Addenbrookes' Hospital in Cambridge with severe head injuries and at the time she was not expected to survive.

After three major brain operations, she has recovered but now has a mental age of eight and uses a wheelchair.

Luton Crown Court heard the boy, aged 15 at the time, repeatedly hit the girl on the head with a bottle while kicking her.

Pleading guilty to rape and grievous bodily harm with intent, he was sentenced to a discretionary life sentence at Luton Crown Court on Friday.

He will serve a minimum of six and a half years in a young offenders unit.

Judge Michael Kay said: 'Even the most case-hardened judge can be confronted with a set of facts that still have the capability to shock. This is one such case.'

Describing his actions as 'sickening and abhorrent', the judge told the teenager: 'I predict you will spend considerably longer in custody than the minimum term.'

Emergency services were called to the park shortly before 9pm on January 19 after the girl was found unconscious.

Prosecutor Beverly Cripps told the court the boy was armed with a knife when the pair met in the park. Soon after he carried out the 'ferocious' attack.

After beating her he dragged her to a quiet area of the park before raping her, she said.

The boy - who was known to his victim - then took her mobile phone to make it look as though she had been mugged, the court was told.

Sentenced: The judge at Luton Crown Court branded the boy 'abhorrent' as he handed him a life sentence

Detective Inspector John Arthur, of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: 'Due to the thorough investigation the boy had no option but to confess his guilt.

'The young victim was known to him and he left her unconscious in a cold dark park after violently assaulting her.

'The boy's behaviour on that night leaves me in no doubt that he is an extremely dangerous person.'

'The victim will need constant care and she will always need her family's support due to the injuries she has suffered but I hope that today's sentencing will go some way in helping them start to look forward.'
