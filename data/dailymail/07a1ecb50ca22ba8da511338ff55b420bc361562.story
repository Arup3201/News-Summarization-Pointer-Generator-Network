A 7-year-old boy and self-described 'biggest fan' of NFL player J.J. Watt sent the football star a special gift - his own autographed Pee Wee jersey.

The Houston Texans defensive end posted an image of the boy's letter and signed shirt on Twitter Tuesday. 

The letter said: 'Dear J.J.: I am 7 years old. My name is Anthony Tarantelli and I am your biggest fan. People call me J.J. because I also play DE and TE like you.

It continued, 'I wear number 99 like you you too. I was the most feared rusher in my league this year.'

Confidence: 7-year-old Anthony Tarantelli sent this message and jersey to J.J. Watt 

Tarantelli then explained 'I am sending you my autographed game jersey so you will know me when I am a famous NFL player. 99 rocks!! Your friend Anthony.'

Included at the bottom of the letter was an illustration of Watt playing against Andrew Luck, the Indianapolis Colts quarterback.

Watt approved of the boy's move, tweeting 'This kid has some guts...I like it.'

Watt told Anthony in a video message he may 'expect something in the mail,' the 7-year-old's mother Lauren Tarantelli told TMZ Sports.

She also said that a referee previously warned Anthony to calm down while playing. 

The  shirt was first mentioned on Facebook by his father, before one of his friends told him he was familiar with the agent for the NFL star, father Joe Tarantelli told TMZ Sports.

Watt's name, meanwhile, is currently being included in discussions by sports news outlets over whether or not he will win the NFL's MVP award this year.

Last week, Watt told MMQB 'That's for people like you to decide, not me. I can't change any voters' minds, and I don't think I should try. I don't care, actually. It doesn't matter to me.

'If people vote for me, great. But to politic for it, no. Please vote for me? No. People who play don't get to decide who wins, nor should they. I want to be deserving, but not because I politicked for it. My play on the field is all that should matter. Nothing else.'
