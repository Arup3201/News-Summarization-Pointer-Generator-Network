If you're a family who likes to plan ahead while also enjoying your own space - this £20,000 holiday home could be just what you've been looking for.

The hidden nuclear bunker, built in 1960 during the Cold War, was designed to withstand an atomic blast and monitor the aftermath of such an attack.

Surrounded by farmland near the village of Ashwell in Hertfordshire, the 20ft by 8ft underground lair is now on the market - boasting a modest bathroom and a monitoring chamber with the ability to connect to a phone line in the event of a catastrophe.

On the market: This hidden bunker in Hertfordshire, built in 1960 during the Cold War to withstand an atomic blast, can be bought for £20,000

The bunker, accessible only by a narrow shaft, was constructed by the Royal Observer Corps (ROC) as a military outpost - one of more than 800 across the UK.

The small space is currently uninhabited and subject to planning approval but could be put to multiple uses - including a wine cellar, a holiday home or even a doomsday storage unit.

Business development director Mark Bradbury, 46, who bought the bunker in 2006 after it was sold to the Ministry of Defence in 1993, claims the possibilities for usage are endless.

Mr Bradbury, who lives in Ashwell, just a mile from the hideaway, said: 'The bunker has got a fascinating history, with its origins dating back to the height of the Cold War.

'However you can date the site's military connections even further back to 1931 when the area was used as an outpost to spot foreign military aircraft.

'Back then, it was merely an observation platform on raised stilts, and it was often still used during World War Two for the same purpose.

'It wasn't until 1960 that this role changed when the RoC moved their focus towards the nuclear threat from overseas.'

According to official RoC documentation, a team of three would be expected to live underground in the event of a 'nuclear incident', providing reports on the levels of radioactivity in the area.

Manned by members of the RoC, drawn mainly from the local community, it was their job to report their findings to the RoC headquarters in Bedford.

However the site was decommissioned on September 30 1991 following the global nuclear de-escalation that spelled the end of the Cold War.

Mr Bradbury added: 'Despite its military history, I've actually considered converting the space into a bunker themed bed and breakfast.

Waiting for interest: Current owner Mark Bradbury says he is yet to have any offers but believes bunkers such as these are popular with those preparing for an apocalypse 

'But I've just not had the time to commit to such a project.

'I've had a few offers come in for it so I'm sure someone with the time and resources will come and put it to use'

'I've heard nuclear bunkers are in demand by preppers looking for a place to hole up in the event of a disaster.'

Among the 800 ROC nuclear bunkers were 29 sprawling stations which served as secret headquarters.

Many of these larger spaces have now been transformed into luxury properties - including a five-bedroom timber-clad eco-house in Somerset.

Britain's secret nuclear bunkers are being put to use in all sorts of ways - from houses and vets' surgeries to recording studios and even a laser tag arena.

Much larger than the Hertfordshire hideaway newly on the market, many of these sprawling HQ stations were built with bedrooms, canteens, generators and decontamination rooms.

One bunker in Exeter, Devon, has been turned into a post-apocalyptic laser tag arena while another in Yeovil, Somerset, has become a five-bedroom timber-clad eco-house - which was recently on the market for almost £700,000.

Nestled into the side of a hill, it was converted after years of laying derelict and being broken into by explorers and the homeless. The entire bunker's ventilation system was overhauled and is now being used to make the house more energy efficient. 

Secret history: Britain's Royal Observer Corps HQs once held 70 volunteers each who would have helped rebuild Britain after a nuclear war. This one, nestled on a hillside in Yeovil, Somerset, lay empty and derelict for years (pictured) - and has now become a five-bed eco-house

Bunking down: One of the former Yeovil bunker's five bedrooms, with barely a nod to the site's secret Cold War past. It is just one bunker that has found an unusual new use - others include a recording studio, a laser tag arena, a vets' surgery and a mock house for police training.

More comfortable: The newly-built house offers a few more home comforts and fewer foil-packed government rations than its previous form

Demise: Almost half of the 29 ROC headquarters have been demolished (in orange) since closing down. The HQs were part of a larger, complex network which also included 11 regional seats of government, two of which have been restored, and hundreds of tiny monitoring posts
