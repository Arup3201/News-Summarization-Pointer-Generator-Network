A Lingerie Bowl player and personal assistant was forced to go topless in front of her boss's friends and babysit his prostitutes when he passed out, she claims in a lawsuit.

Lotti Bluemner, 31, accuses investor Erik Gordon, 41, of coercing her into exposing her bare breasts in front of crowds so he could snort cocaine off them to impress women.

His requests did not stop even after she got pregnant, according to court documents seen by the New York Post.

Suing Gordon, head of Ergo Media Capital LLC, for unfair dismissal, Bluemner is demanding $13 million in damages.

Past career: Bluemner was a kicker for LA Temptation in the 2006 Lingerie Bowl tournament, coming second

Bluemner, from Brookfield, Wisconsin, featured in Lingerie Bowl, which involved women playing full-contact football in their underwear, pads and helmets.

A kicker for LA Temptation in the 2006 tournament, she helped secure victory against Dallas Desire in the semi-finals but ultimately lost to New York Euphoria.

Her $90,000-a-year job was meant to be an administrative role at Gordon's home in LA, organizing his diary, the Post reported.

However, in court documents seen by DailyMail.com, she claims she was used to 'essentially babysit' as Gordon went 'partying, drinking, and consuming various illegal drugs each night... as well as regularly engaging strippers and prostitutes.'

Gordon rejects Bluemner's claims and says that she stole $1,200 from his credit card at the Apple store

'Used': Bluemner's lawsuit claims she was used to help Gordon pick up women 

She adds that 'Gordon's modus operandi, consisted of trading upon his father's (one of the founders of Angelo & Gordon) wealth, fame, connections, and political capital by taking meetings during the day with his and his father's wealthy and politically connected friends, celebrities, and politicians' before partying.

And she was ordered, she says, to take his new girlfriend on multi-thousand dollar shopping sprees.

In papers seen by DailyMail.com, Gordon rejects the accusations and claims Bluemner used his credit card to spend $1,229.51 on personal items from the Apple store.

Bluemner denies theft. 

Now based in Florida, with business in New York, Gordon has filed his counter claim in Manhattan, while Bluemner's case will be heard in California's Federal Court.

Gordon told the Post: 'Everyone who knows me and knows Ms. Bluemner has found humor in her bizarre allegations . . . I have countless friends who are women who have faced horrific instances of hostile work environments and quid-pro-quo sexual harassment. Ms. Bluemner's complaint . . . does each of them an injustice.'
