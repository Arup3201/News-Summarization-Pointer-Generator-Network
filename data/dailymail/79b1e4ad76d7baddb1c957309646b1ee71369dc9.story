At least one man spent the night sleeping outside of a New York City bookstore in order to meet Hillary Clinton at a signing for her new memoir but he only got to spend five seconds with the former Secretary of State.

Once the awaiting crowds were allowed inside the Barnes and Noble store in Union Square, they were handed a list of rules that stipulated that she would not pose for photographs with them or personalizing their signed books.

The event was held as a kick off effort for her new book, Hard Choices, but apparently the buzz from a string of news interviews and personal appearances such this morning's event at Barnes and Noble are not helping a great deal.

Book trial: Many have seen the release of her latest memoir and ensuing book tour as a preamble to a likely 2016 presidential run, though she says she has not made a decision about the race (pictured Tuesday at the New York City Barnes and Noble)

On sale: All major bookstores are selling the 656-page tome for 40 per cent off the sticker price, knocking it down to $21 from $35

A Books A Million store in McLean, Virginia just outside of D.C. has already marked the price of the tome down by 40 per cent for loyalty members and 30 per cent to the general public.

Sunday Times reporter Toby Harnden shared a picture via Twitter that showed the markdown on the book, noting that a Books A Million manager said that it was 'very unusual' to have a new book immediately marked off at more than 20 per cent.

The manager said the sale 'really threw me'.

They were not the only store to knock the price of Mrs Clinton's book down dramatically, as Amazon is also selling the hardcover edition for $21, which marks a 40 per cent cut to the sticker price of $35.

Even Barnes and Noble was selling it at the same lowered price, and a spokeswoman from the bookstore told The New York Times
 that the turnout did not stand out- even though there were a handful of
 die-hards who spent the night on the sidewalk to get a good spot.

The
 spokeswoman said that the author of The Hunger Games and actor James 
Franco drew similarly-sized crowds as well as Democratic Senator 
Elizabeth Warren.

Get in line: The crowd wrapped around the block and a spokeswoman for the Barnes and Noble said that it was about the same number of people who attended signings by James Franco and Elizabeth Warren

Rallying support: The Ready for Hillary political action committee has already raised millions in expectation of her run though she has repeatedly said that she will not have a firm answer until the end of the year

That said, Justin Bieber and the Jonas Brothers apparently drew bigger crowds when they had their own signings.

Sean Brennan was one of the ones who stuck it out, however, and he is used to pulling all-nighters for authors he cares about.

Business Insider spoke to the 41-year-old Queens native who said that he has waited outside twice for two different signings by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, as well as the late Maya Angelou and all of the Harry Potter releases.

He, like many Clinton supporters, knows full well that she has not officially announced her expected 2016 presidential run but Mr Brennan felt the urge to reiterate his support.

'That's what I'm going to say to her if I get my five seconds as she's signing the book,' he told Business Insider reporter Hunter Walker.

'I'm going to say that I know it's really selfish, but we are selfish and we really need her to run. We do really need her to run.'
