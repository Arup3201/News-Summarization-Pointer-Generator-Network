Channel 4 was under increased pressure last night to explain why it broadcast a quiz featuring obscene jokes about the Queen just minutes after the 9pm watershed.

The Daily Mail told yesterday how viewers were outraged by the antics of drunken comedians on the Big Fat Quiz of 2012, presented by controversial comic Jimmy Carr on Sunday.

TV watchdog Ofcom has already received complaints about the pre-recorded show and the countless vile sexual jokes told by stand-up star Jack Whitehall and actor James Corden.

No comment: Channel 4 bosses refused to break their silence over the furore surrounding Big Fat Quiz Of The Year 2012. Featured guests included  Richard Ayoade, Russell Howard, Jonathan Ross, Jimmy Carr, Jack Whitehall,  James Cordon and Gabby Logan

Anger: Comedian Jack Whitehall and actor James Corden were behind many of the offensive remarks on Channel 4's Big Fat Quiz of the year 2012

They included puerile remarks about the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, Barack Obama, Usain Bolt and Susan Boyle.

Lord Burns, the chairman of Channel 4, last night refused to comment on the broadcast.

Britain's most successful comedian, Billy Connolly, has stuck the knife into Channel 4, as they face huge criticism over their Big Fat Quiz of 2012.

Speaking before the show was broadcast, The Big Yin, 70, accused modern 'gurning' comics of killing stand-up because 'Channel 4-type' comedians prefer to grab TV chat show spots instead of working on new material.

Connolly, who was voted most influential stand-up ever in a poll last year, fumed: 'When I see all these London guys who all hang out together at the Groucho and all that, I'm really glad I'm not one of them.

'They call jokes "gags". I don't talk like that.

'I don't want to be like them, Channel 4-type comedy people.

'They have this drive and I'm glad I don't have it.

'Like, you must be seen at Edinburgh until you're 99.

'Look at him, isn't he great!' No, he's not great.

'I listen to them on the radio at the Edinburgh festival, but I wouldn't darken its door.

'I think stand-up comedy is in danger.

'Stand-ups spend their time gurning on panel shows in the hope of one day being given a chat show.'

After the Mail attempted to speak to 
him at his home and over the telephone a member of the Channel 4 press 
office told us he would not be commenting and asked us to stop 
contacting him.

David Abraham, the chief executive of Channel 4, was also unable to comment because he was on holiday in Vietnam, we were told.

Now Tory MP Conor Burns, a member of 
the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, is demanding to 
know why the quiz was broadcast as early as 9pm.

He said: ‘I actually watched some of 
the broadcast because we are staying with family for the holidays and I 
found it quite distasteful.

'I walked into the other room. Sadly this 
sort of gauche, vulgar “anything goes humour” that appeals to the lowest
 common denominator in society is becoming more common.

‘I just wonder, given everything that 
has been going on in the media over the last six months, what has 
happened to editorial judgment and reason.

‘It was base, unfunny comedy and in some ways I thought its greater crime really was that it just wasn’t funny.

‘In my role on the committee I will be
 writing to Channel 4 and asking for its editorial  explanation for 
broadcasting such unpleasant output so soon after the watershed.’

Former Gavin and Stacey star Corden, 
34, and Marlborough-educated Whitehall, 24, were seen to get drunk on 
red wine  during the quiz which was shown between 9pm and 10.30pm.

Their infantile behaviour was egged on
 by Jonathan Ross, 52, who left the BBC after making an 
abusive phone call to actor Andrew Sachs during a radio show.

Channel 4 has been accused of failing 
to learn the lessons from the Sachsgate scandal which was also 
pre-recorded and cleared before broadcast on the Russell Brand radio 
show.

Criticism: MP Conor Burns, member of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he watched part of the programme and found it 'distasteful'

Last night the Channel 4 quiz, which 
attracted an audience of 2.5million, was coming under increased 
criticism from viewers via the internet and social networking sites such
 as Twitter.

Cathie Green wrote: ‘No lessons learned from the Brand/Ross event which was on the same gutteral level ...

‘These idiot men are so grossly 
arrogant, have no sense of respect for others, let alone the people whom
 they have so sickeningly vilified.’

Patricia Martin wrote: ‘I usually like
 that quiz but this year we turned over because I was sickened by them 
being so rude about  the Queen and the really bad  language.’

Halfway through the broadcast Corden 
could be seen pulling a bottle of red wine from under his desk and 
pouring himself and Whitehall a drink while eating pizza.

Carr later joked that the pair had drunk a bottle of wine each.

After making a disgusting joke about 
Susan Boyle, Corden appears to realise he has gone too far saying: ‘This
 is where I do myself in and forget we’re recording this and it’s going 
to be broadcast on TV.

‘I just think we are having a great time eating pizza.’

Peter Riley tweeted: ‘Big Fat Quiz Of 
The Year, basically a reminder of what a sorry state Britain has become,
 and what a disgraceful year 2012 has been.'

One comedian who won't join in with the pack of 'competitive' comedians vying to deliver the best line is Rory Bremner.

The impressionist slammed the BBC panelist show Mock the Week, which satirises news and current affairs, for being 'highly competitive and quite aggressive'.

Mr Bremner, who has starred in the award-winning Bremner, Bird and Fortune sketch show, appeared as a panelist on the programme for two series following its 2005 launch.

He compared some comedians, who regularly deliver controversial remarks, to 'prize fighters', the Daily Telegraph reported.

The comedian refused to participate in the show, hosted by Dara O'Briain, and said that he had learned other comedians found the atmosphere too abrasive.

In 2009 Jo Brand joined the chorus of discontent about the show, saying she left because of a lack of female panelists and the hostile nature of the show.

She said at the time that she and other male comedians found that they had to 'bite someone's foot off before they let us say something' on the show.

The BBC were unavailable to comment.
