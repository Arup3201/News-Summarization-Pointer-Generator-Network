Having secured a three-point lead at the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win at Stoke on Monday, it's no surprise that Chelsea's players are full of festive cheer heading into Christmas Day.

Didier Drogba took to Instagram to show off the positive mood in the Blues camp, posting a video of himself and his team-mates singing 'We wish you a merry Christmas'.

Joined by Diego Costa, Eden Hazard, Willian, Oscar and Filipe Luis, Drogba belts out the popular carol as the rest of Jose Mourinho's men bounce around in the background.

Their win at the Britannia Stadium means Chelsea go into Christmas Day three points clear of Manchester City, who face a Boxing Day trip to West Brom.

The Stamford Bridge outfit have won three Premier League titles over the last decade and each time they have been top of the table come December 25.

That statistic will warm the hearts of Chelsea fans, who will watch their side host in-form West Ham on Friday.

The Hammers currently occupy fourth place and the final Champions League spot after an unbeaten run of five games. 

Diego Costa is known for being one of the funniest characters in the Chelsea dressing room
