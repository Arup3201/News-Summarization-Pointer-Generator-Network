The four-acre luxury property near Lake Wellington has a swimming pool, four bedrooms and luxurious finishes, as well as a new 20-stall barn, paddocks and schooling area for horses.

Gates rented the property for $600,000 from December 2011 to May 2012, while his teenage daughter Jennifer was competing in the Winter Equestrian Festival, according to realtor.com.

The family are believed to have spent about $1.1 million renting homes in the area in recent years, while Jennifer competes, according to South Florida Business Journal.

While his daughter trains her horses, Bill and Melinda can spend time with their new neighbors, who include New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Tommy Lee Jones, and Bruce Springsteen, whose daughter Jessica also rides competitively.

Aside from the extensive equestrian facilities, the house has a fireplace in the living room, and a lounge that overlooks the 32ft long swimming pool.

While the house offers a luxurious retreat to its new owners, Wellington is a town focused purely on horses.
