Chewing bamboo is serious work for giant panda Bai Yun, who quite happily gnaws on the stuff for up to 12 hours a day.

So when the female panda chipped a tooth at her home in the San Diego Zoo, California, it meant that a trip to the dentist was on the cards. 

The 23-year-old panda was given anesthesia so that a veterinary team could take X-rays and repair the damaged  lower canine.

A dental composite was used to fill in the chipped tooth, which was then cured with a light to seal the filling. The team also took the opportunity to give the animal's teeth a good clean.

'The good news is the pulp canal hadn't been compromised, but it's very close to breaking into the pulp canal,' said Meg Sutherland-Smith, associate director of veterinary services at the San Diego Zoo. 

'What we attempted to do was a restorative procedure to cover up the part of the tooth that was chipped to, hopefully, prevent any further chipping or deterioration.'

San Diego Zoo, which was recently named one of the US's top ten zoos by USA Today, explained that since giant pandas use their teeth to chew and break apart bamboo, their teeth can get worn or damaged over time.

Bamboo is their primary source of nutrition for giant pandas. But since the foodstuff is not actually very nutritious, the animals need to eat a great deal deal of bamboo to get the energy they need.

The San Diego Zoo’s currently has three giant pandas in residence on a research loan from China as part of a program to study the endangered species up close and help with breeding.

A firm favourite with keepers, Bai Yun - which means 'White Cloud' - has already given birth to six cubs, five of which were conceived naturally.

Hua Mei, aged just six and a half weeks, has a little snooze during a routine examination. Weighing just under seven pounds, vets found the little cub to be in excellent health for her age

The panda and her partner Gao Gao - father to four of her cubs - have become known as the zoo's 'super couple', thanks to their breeding record. 

Pandas are notoriously poor breeders, which is one reason their species is endangered, and females have only three days a year in which they can conceive. 

The San Diego Zoo in Balboa Park, San Diego, California, is one of the few zoos in the world that houses the giant panda.

It is also home to more than 3,700 animals of more than 650 species and subspecies.

The zoo pioneered the concept of open-air, cageless exhibits that re-create natural animal habitats.

Its Institute for Conservation Research  raises California Condors, giant pandas, tigers, African Black Rhinos, and a 145 other endangered species. 

San Diego has reintroduced more than 30 endangered species back into the wild, and has conserved habitat at 50 field sites. 

It also have over 200 conservation scientist working in 35 countries around the world. 

The zoo also employs professional geneticists, cytologists and veterinarians, and it maintains a cryopreservation facility for rare sperm and eggs called the frozen zoo.

Bai Yun first became a mother in 1999 after being artificially inseminated with sperm from Shi Shi, the male panda at the zoo at that time.

On August 21, she gave birth to her first cub Hua Mei, which translates as 'China USA'. The female cub was the first giant panda born in the United States to survive to adulthood.

In 2003, Mei Sheng - which translates as 'Born in the USA' - came along, followed by Su Lin (A Little Bit of Something very Cute) in 2005, Zhen Zhen (Precious) in 2007 and Yun Zi (Son of Cloud) in 2009.

Her youngest cub named Xiao Liwu (Little Gift) was born in 2012, making Bai Yun  the second oldest panda on record to give birth. The oldest  was two days older than Bai Yun at the time of birth of their respective cubs.

The San Diego Zoo began their vital work with giant pandas in 1987, when two of the animals came over from China to visit for 100 days. 

After falling in love with the species, in 1996, the zoo worked out an agreement with China to house two adult pandas and their young offspring.

The zoos current three residents enjoy large exhibit areas with trees and climbing structures, as well as air-conditioned bedrooms.

Next to the panda viewing area is the building that houses the Giant Panda Team, where keepers and researchers can observe and study giant panda biology and behavior. 

As part of this long-term program, the Zoo is also collaborating with the Chinese Academy of Science in studies of behavior, ecology, genetics and conservation of wild pandas living in the Foping Nature Reserve. 

A mere 1,600 giant pandas are believed to exist in the wild, and the species is primarily threatened by habitat loss. San Diego Zoo Global, in conjunction with Chinese panda experts, continues to work on science-based panda conservation programs.
