A couple is suing a hospital over the death of their new-born girl Chloe, after a planned home birth went tragically wrong.

Parents Emma Kilby and Paul Gent, from Melbourne, say they're lodging the legal action over her death  because 'we just don’t want this to happen to anyone else'.

They say the publicly-funded home option, which they insist was offered to them by Sunshine Hospital, was the reason the birth went wrong. Chloe died almost 11 days later.

Emma Kilby and Paul Gent are taking legal action over the home birth of the baby Chloe

The couple claim in a statement regarding the writ lodged in court, that the home birth program offered by Sunshine Hospital 'failed us'

Court documents show that Ms Kilby's waters broke at 12.15am on January 26, 2012, and after calling the hospital they were told the originally assigned midwife was not available and another was on the way. The baby was born at about 12.50am with no midwife present.

That's when, they say, Chloe's colour had them concerned something was wrong. The couple says they received a text message from the hospital with a phone number for the midwife, which they allege was wrong. It's further claimed that the midwife arrived at 1.25am, by then the documents state, Chloe was not breathing.

She died on February 5.

 'There are really basic things that could have been done to make a difference, that mean that Chloe would be alive. That program failed us,' they said.

'Mostly it was about communication.

'Giving us the right phone number for a start and being on the phone and asking more questions about how the baby was, what she was doing, instead of hanging up and leaving us on our own. 

'That is what should have happened. They knew the midwife would take an extended time to arrive and should have advised us or called an ambulance.

'It wasn’t as if we were demanding a home birth at all costs.'

They say that at about the 20 week mark, the possibility of a home birth was raised with them by the hospital.

Ms Kilby and Mr Gent say after the trauma of a quick labour which led to their oldest daughter being born in the back of ambulance, they decided to move back to Melbourne and within close proximity of a hospital.

'It wasn’t as if we were demanding a home birth at all costs,' said Ms Kilby and Mr Gent. Their lawyer told Daily Mail Australia 'these people are not ideologically tied to home birth, by any stretch'

Their lawyer Emily Hart of Maurice Blackburn confirmed the action against Western Health had been lodged.

'They wanted to make it (the birth) as seamless as possible, so if they did have a quick labour, they were close to a hospital,' she said.

Ms Hart added that the couple, who have three other children, did enter into conversation with hospital officials immediately after their daughter's death but were not happy with the explanations they received.

'They had a meeting with the hospital soon after Chloe passed away and had to try pretty hard to get it but they weren't satisfied with the answers they received,' Ms Hart added. 

'Their primary focus is to make sure it doesn't happen to another family. There are not many of these home birth situations, so it's certainly a unique set of facts.

'These people are not ideologically tied to home birth, by any stretch.'

Ms Hart explained that the legal action was based on several factors, the allegation the hospital provided them with the wrong phone contact for the midwife assigned to them, that not enough questions were asked about Chloe's health in the moments after the birth.

They were further concerned over how long it took for the midwife to arrive at their home.

'We did what we were told to do and we did everything that was asked of us, we went to all our antenatal appointments. There were shortcomings in that service,' the couple added.

Western Health officials told Daily Mail Australia they would be making no comment.
