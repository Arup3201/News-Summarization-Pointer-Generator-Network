Ronnie Barker's son is to face trial accused of  having 2,394 indecent images of children on his home computer.

Adam Barker, 44, appeared in court yesterday on 20 child porn charges after spending more than eight years on the run from the police.

The once chubby former bit-part television actor looked gaunt during the brief hearing at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court in West London.

Barker had originally been arrested in
2003 but vanished a year later and was on the run until he walked into a
London police station last month.

After his father, the much-loved star 
of Porridge, The Two Ronnies and Open All Hours, died in 2005 at the age
of 76, detectives were waiting to question his son at the memorial 
service held at Westminster Abbey. However, Adam Barker did not turn up.

He also missed the funeral of his 
mother Joy, who died aged 78 after a short illness last year, leaving 
him an inheritance of more than £2million. Barker is accused of making 
indecent images of children at his home in Ealing, West London, between 
January 1999 and June 2003.

The charges relate to images rated 
between level one, the lowest category, and level four, which includes 
child rape. In court yesterday Barker, wearing a blue checked shirt 
under a grey sleeveless pullover, spoke only to confirm his name, date 
of birth and address.

Asked his address, Barker replied: 
‘None at the moment.’ There was no application for bail. Barker, who has
had minor roles in the television dramas Monarch Of The Glen and 
Casualty and the films Shakespeare In Love and Tomorrow Never Dies, has a
brother Larry, 51, and a sister Charlotte, 48. No family members were 
in court for the hearing.

Presiding magistrate Richard Bristow 
told Barker: ‘These matters are too serious for this court and they will
now be committed to Crown Court.’

His case will be committed to Isleworth Crown Court for a plea and case management hearing on September 20.
