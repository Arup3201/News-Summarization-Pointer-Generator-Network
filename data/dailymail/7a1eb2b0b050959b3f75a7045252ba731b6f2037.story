Virgin Atlantic has become the latest major airline to ban flights over Iraq amid the growing threat of passenger jets being shot out of the sky.

The decision by Richard Branson’s airline comes after Emirates announced it would stop flying over Iraq because of security fears. Air France-KLM, Air Berlin and Poland’s LOT have followed suit.

World aviation bosses last night agree to set up a senior-level task force to deal with growing concerns about flight safety, in the wake of the downing of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in Ukraine with the loss of 298 lives.

Pro-Russian separatists have been blamed for the downing of the Malaysia Airlines flightin eastern Ukraine.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has urged Moscow to ‘stop the supply of these dangerous and sophisticated weapons into the hands of semi-trained separatists, which is what has given rise to the disaster with the Malaysian airliner’.

However, there are growing fears that insurgents in Iraq could also target passenger flights.

The country lies on the border of the main flight path between Europe and Asia, with hundreds of aircraft passing over it each day.

A popular route is over the Iraqi city of Mosul, a stronghold of ISIS militants.

Lufthansa, the main German carrier, has said it will avoid some parts of Iraq, but Qantas has insisted passengers on its Dubai to London flights will continue to fly through Iraqi airspace.

British Airways is also continuing to use Iraqi airspace, emphasising the need for clarity about just which routes are safe to fly.

International Air Transport Association director general and chief executive Tony Tyler said: 'The tragic shooting down of MH17 was an attack on the whole air transport industry.

'The world's airlines are angry. Civil aircraft are instruments of peace. They should not be the target of weapons of war.’

He went on: 'We were told that flights traversing Ukraine's territory at above 32,000 feet would not be in harm's way. We now know how wrong that guidance was. It is essential that airlines receive clear guidance regarding threats to their passengers, crew and aircraft.’

Last night UN body the International Civil Aviation Organisation announced plans to better share data about the threat posed to civilian flights.

A meeting at its headquarters in Montreal agreed information that could affect the safety of airline passengers and crews should be effectively collected and disseminated.

The British government accuses Russia of putting the 'dangerous and sophisticated weapons into the hands of semi-trained separatists' leading to the downing of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine

There are fears IS militia could attempt to shoot down passenger jets flying through Iraqi airspace

The aviation industry has called for the ICAO to also look at the need to incorporate into international law, through appropriate UN frameworks, measures to govern the design, manufacture and deployment of modern anti-aircraft weaponry.

The ICAO said it was also convening a high-level safety conference with all of its 191 member states in February 2015.

The organisation's secretary general Raymond Benjamin said all the aviation bodies 'strongly condemned the use of weapons against the civilian aircraft'.

He described the downing of MH17, with the loss of 298 lives including 10 Britons, as 'unacceptable' and he sent the aviation world's 'deepest condolences' to the families of the victims.

Jim McAuslan, general secretary of British pilots' organisation Balpa, said: 'It is reassuring that the UN aviation body and airlines accept that there is a problem with the lack of clear, uniform rules and information guiding pilots on when they should not fly over conflict areas.

'What we need now is action from the working group. The flawed current system allowed 298 innocent passengers, pilots and crew to become targets in a war and pilots want to see a solid and serious solution to stop this ever happening again.'

He went on: 'We will be asking the British Government to lead the way and urgently push for a safety-first approach that would protect British passengers whatever airline they are flying with and wherever they are travelling.'

Jeff Poole, director general of the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (Canso) said: 'The downing of Flight MH17 raises vital questions about the safety of aircraft over conflict zones.

'The incident shows that there are gaps in the overall management of airspace.'
