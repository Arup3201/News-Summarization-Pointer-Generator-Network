Council binmen failed to empty food recycling bins on an entire street for two whole months - because they couldn't find the road with their new GPS mapping system.

In total, 28 sets of food recycling bins on Blackhorse Avenue in the village of Blackrod, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, were left to rot for weeks on end despite the road being listed in the  local A-Z and other local maps.

Council refuse collectors claimed they found the street, built 50 years ago and situated just a few yards from the village's main road, 'difficult to 
locate' after being issued with new specialist mapping technology.

Angry: Mother-of-three Joanne Roberts, pictured outside her home on Blackhorse Avenue, Blackrod, Bolton, Greater Manchester, said refuse collectors failed to empty food recycling bins on her street for eight weeks despite numerous complaints to Bolton Council

The oversight continued for eight weeks despite locals repeatedly complaining refuse collectors had failed to show for their fortnightly collections four times - leaving overflowing bins crawling with maggots and swarming with flies.

Binmen spotted by residents collecting from neighbouring streets on behalf of Bolton Council also refused to empty the food recycling bins on Blackhorse Avenue, saying: 'Sorry, it's not on my shift love.'

Residents claim the stench from the bins became so bad they didn't want to walk outside their homes.

Mother of three Joanne Roberts, 44, a doctors receptionist, said: 'We are a family of five so you can imagine how much food recycling we had accumulated.

'Everything goes in there. This has been a load of rubbish, quite literally. The flies were ridiculous and I had to leave the bin away from my house on the main road which I think I could have been fined for but I couldn't leave it near my house, the stench was disgusting.

'I don't know what a dead body smells like but I imagine it to be like my bin. I couldn't even walk past it.'

Mrs Roberts added: 'When they didn't pick it up the first week I thought it was because they were still getting used to it so I didn't worry, but when the second fortnightly round didn't get collected we rang the council. We'd never had a problem before but they said it was because it was a new crew - I do not think that is a good enough excuse.'

Ongoing: Binmen failed to show up for their fortnightly collections of food recycling bins on Blackhorse Avenue in Blackrod, Bolton, at least four times

The mother-of-three claimed she could see binmen collecting rubbish from nearby streets and it would have been impossible for them not to see Blackhorse Avenue.

She said: 'I could see the binmen on their collections so how could they not see our street? It is literally just off the main road so there's no excuse whatsoever. They said that they didn't know where the street was but the streets just yards away were being emptied.

'Four out of the five of us in my family work and all pay our taxes, yet we are not getting the services we pay for.

'Plus, a lot of the people in the street are quite elderly and they were dragging their bins out each fortnight only for them not to be collected. It is not fair. It makes me really angry.'

Mrs Roberts said that she phoned the council numerous times and had been told that there would be an assisted collection to pick up the bins in the next two days. But, she claims, they never showed up.

She continued: 'They just didn't show up
 and so I kept phoning. Every time I called they said it hadn't been 
listed. Although it was a local number I am still forking out my own 
money ringing.

Joanne Roberts claims that binmen approached by Blackhorse Avenue residents as they collected rubbish from other streets refused to help

'When I called back the second time they said my initial call hadn't been registered but that they'd do an assisted pick up yet that never happened either. I phoned numerous times over the period of eight weeks and phoned again every time it wasn't collected.

'When the binmen came to do an assisted collection for someone else an elderly lady came out and asked if they could take away hers but they told her, "sorry, it's not on my shift love".

'They are just jobsworths, the least they could do while they were there is to give us a hand. These bins were full and I expect that there are rats close by, I don't want to think about it.

'It got to the point where it was defeating the object because I just couldn't recycle any more because my bin was that full. It had to go in the grey bin which by rights I could have been fined for as it's breaking the law.

'After that we got the manager of recycling out to do a home visit and all the green bins were lined up. The smell was sheer disgusting, it was vile. In fact the smell is still there and I suggested that they pay for the bins to be professionally cleaned, I'm even too disgusted to put my rubbish back in after the amount of maggots and flies and sludge in there.'

Another neighbour said the excuse that binmen couldn't find the street - which was built in 1963 - was ridiculous.

Resident David Brandwood,59, said: 'Our green bin hadn't been emptied for about eight weeks - there was rotting food and garden waste in there for ages.

'It was really smelly and horrible. I rang the council three times but nothing happened. I don't buy the idea that they couldn't find us - this street has been here since 1963.'

Bolton Council said it has now emptied the bins.

A spokesman added: 'Recently introduced changes to the collection service meant that new crews were still learning new collection rounds. Unfortunately Blackhorse Avenue was missed by the crew as it was difficult to locate from their maps.

'We would like to apologise to residents for any inconvenience. The issue has been highlighted to the new crews to ensure it is not missed on future collections.'
