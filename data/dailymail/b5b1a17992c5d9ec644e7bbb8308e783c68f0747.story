A photo of a child murder has been posted on the dating website the killer used in the weeks before he sexually assaulted and murdered an eight-year-old.

Michael Rafferty's image appeared on Plenty of Fish, attached to the profile of 'scoobmike', a 'non-smoker' who 'isn't seeking a relationship or any kind of commitment.'

'Scoobmike' claimed to be a 36-year-old from Sasketchewan in Canada and hoping to meet women between the ages of 
18 and 46.

Would like to meet... Killer Michael Rafferty's photo was published on dating website Plenty of Fish

The photo of Rafferty, who is now appealing his conviction for first-degree murder, kidnapping and sexual assault, was widely published in the media after the killing in 2009.

Several women who had met the 31-year-old online testified at an emotional London trial.

The sick joke follows the disappearance of eight-year-old Victoria Stafford in April 2009 on her 
way home from school.

Her body was found two months later in a field 
near Mount Forest. Rafferty. from Woodstock, Ontario,  and his former girlfriend, Terri-Lynn 
McClintic, now 21, were charged with her death, and McClintic pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in 2010.

The killer's new dating profile says he 'love(s) to have fun, travel and laugh, listen to music, meet people, dance, watch movie (sic).'

It says he is a six-foot 'caucasian pisces with brown eyes' and with a high school education.

He describes his perfect first date as, 'Dinner, movie, walk by the river. Talk and get to know one another, Do something fun.'

Disturbing case: Victoria 'Tori' Stafford was only eight years old when Rafferty abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered her while 
high on drugs

The photo was taken down by Tuesday, according to the Toronto Sun, after an anonymous user contacted the site and the police.

Plenty of Fish spokesperson Shannon 
Smith said the site's staff 'diligently monitor our website internally and our 
users’ safety is our top priority.'

The website is 'community-driven' and once the photo was reported the site’s customer service department would have investigated the complaint and taken it down.

'Our users report any suspicious 
activity themselves, and each profile is exposed to thousands of users, 
so there is no place to hide and these type of profiles don’t stay up,' 
she said.
