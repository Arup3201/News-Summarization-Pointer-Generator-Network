A chilling new image has emerged showing a child wearing the uniform of an Islamic militia being used to fire rockets from a car-mounted missile launcher during fierce clashes with ISIS jihadis.

Illustrating the way children are being increasingly sucked into the deadly violence engulfing vast swathes of Syria and Iraq, the child soldier - who appears no older than eight - wears full military uniform as he kneels down to detonate the explosive.

Until now the majority of children engaged in the conflict have been forced to do so by ISIS militants in the Sunni militants' strongholds of Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq. 

However the young child in this latest image wears the uniform of Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq - a Shia militia allied to the Syrian and Iraqi regimes and a sworn enemy of the Islamic State.

Children have been increasingly drawn in to the bloody conflict in the Middle East, with ISIS establishing a number of Sharia camps where young boys under the age of 16 are sent for a mixture of combat training and lessons in the terror group's hardline interpretation of Islam.

Earlier this month chilling new images emerged from inside Islamic State-run terrorist training schools in Syria, showing child soldiers being trained to kill using assault rifles.

Once the boys turn 16 they are thrown into the frontline alongside adult militants to wield massive assault rifles and rocket launchers in chaotic street battles against troops from the Syrian and Iraqi regimes, Kurdish forces, and rival rebel groups such as the Al Qaeda affiliated Jabhat Al-Nusra.

There have, however, been numerous reports of ISIS forcing children into battle at a much younger age, with militants said to value the so-called martyrdom of children above that of adults.

Until now, ISIS were largely believed to be only group using child soldiers in the conflict, but the emergence of the photograph showing a boy wearing the uniform of Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq has cast new light on the involvement of those under 16 waging jihad in Syria and Iraq.

Fighters: Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, the group the young boy in the latest photograph appears to be fighting for, is a Shia milita that considers the Islamic State among its deadliest enemies

Speaking to MailOnline about child soldiers, Steven Stalinsky, executive Director of the Middle East Media Research Institute, said: 'The indoctrination of children is an ongoing part of life [for ISIS]. There are camps for children, children are learning about jihad in schools and are actively fighting.

'They are fighting with their families, their fathers, uncles and brothers, and as orphans on their own. When they die they become martyrs and fighters tweet pictures of their bodies and they are praised online,' he added.

Earlier this month new images emerged showing an ISIS training school where children little older than 10-years-old are dubbed 'Caliphate Cubs' and dressed in full combat gear as they struggle to hold weapons while standing in front of ISIS' infamous black flag.

The photographs were released by official Islamic State media and apparently show a recently-opened school close to Damascus - the Assad regime-held capital of Syria where other preteen training camps are known have been operating in recent months.

In one photograph a large group of masked and armed child soldiers crowd around a minibus decorated with the ISIS flag, holding their guns aloft and striking poses bearing a striking resemblance to the terror group's executioner in chief - the British militant known as Jihadi John. 

Another image shows a fair-skinned boy being handed a massive AK47 assault rifle by a grey-bearded ISIS general as he stands in formation alongside other young child soldiers.

Other shots from the propaganda release show the children performing fitness tests and military drills designed to train them for the harsh realities of the frontline.

In much the same way as the Nazi Germany preyed on its impressionable young citizens with the creation of the Hitler Youth, ISIS has long groomed children to take part in jihad.

The practice was the subject of the second episode of VICE's groundbreaking 'Islamic State' documentary series, in which very young boys were seen being asked whether they want to be a suicide bomber or a jihadist, and were forced to repeat calls for the murder of Western 'infidels'.

The school images emerged just weeks after ISIS released a video entitled 'The Blood of Jihad 2' - the second installment of a video series revealing life inside the group's training camps.

The video is believed to have been filmed in the ISIS-held province of Nineveh in, Iraq.

The highly choreographed video opens with dramatic slow motion shots of of young boys firing AK47s as they advance in a line. All the boys are seen wearing matching military camouflage fatigues and chequered headscarves.

The first part of the film, which appears to be shot in soft focus and is set to music, then shows the boys undertaking training in martial arts.

One of the boys can be seen holding the black flag of Islamic State whilst another of the boys, wearing a headband with a slogan in Arabic, leads the martial arts drill.

Shock: The images show masked Syrian children under the age of 16 being trained to use assault rifles

Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, the group the young boy in the latest photograph appears to be fighting for, is a Shia milita that considers the Islamic State among its deadliest enemies.

The group is said to be controlled from within Iran, but the majority of its brigades operate in  Iraq.

It even has a significant presence in the largely regime controlled areas of southern Syria, making it one of the most widely widely distributed militant groups engaged in the current conflict.

The group emerged in the mid-2000s following a split with the Mahdi Army, which at the time dominated the Shia insurgency in Iraq. It has claimed responsibility for over 6,000 attacks on American, coalition, and Iraqi forces since that time.

Despite its militant foundations, Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq had candidates running in the 2014 Iraqi parliamentary election under the banner of Al-Sadiqoun Bloc.

Its campaign was marred by violence, however, with a series of bombs exploding at an early campaign rally in eastern Baghdad, killing at least 37 people. Al-Sadiquun Bloc ended up winning just one seat  in the Iraqi Parliament.
