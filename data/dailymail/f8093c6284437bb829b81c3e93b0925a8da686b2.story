A 'lovely hardworking' school girl is believed to have committed suicide after 'vile' bullies tormented her, friends have claimed.

The 14-year-old girl, named locally and on social media sites as Jasmine Clarkson, was spotted 'in distress' by members of the public who raised the alarm yesterday afternoon.

But police officers, paramedics and an air ambulance crew were unable to save the Cirencester school girl.

St Michael's Park in Cirencester where the body of 14-year-old Jasmine Clarkson was found. Police have said there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the teenager's death

She was pronounced dead in St Michael's Park in Cirencester, at 12.30pm yesterday.

Friends took to social media site Twitter to condemn those who they claim tormented Jasmine and 'made (her) want to take (her) own life'.

Paying tribute, the headteacher of Cirencester Kingshill School, Christine Oates, said: 'Jasmine was a lovely girl who was well liked by her friends.

'She was hard working and had a very good relationship with her teachers. The whole school community is upset by the news.

'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family at this sad time. Jasmine will be sorely missed at Kingshill School.'

She said the school is considering the best way to pay their respects to Jasmine and will be discussing any plans with the teenager's family, pupils and staff.

Friends and other pupils at the school are being given 'all the support they need at this difficult time'.

Ms Oates added: 'The school has a Memorial Garden and the pupils are gathering there to pay their respects and console each other.'

It emerged the school held a pre-planned forum entitled Tackling Bullying Together just hours after Jasmine died.

The school stressed the event had been in the calendar for months and was in no way linked to Jasmine.

It is understood the school had not received any reports of the 14-year-old being bullied.

Shortly after Jasmine's death, one friend wrote on Twitter: 'Can’t believe people could ever, EVER do such a disgusting thing.'

The post followed several 'RIP Jasmine' tweets including one which read: 'How many murderers do you think you’ve walked past?'

Another friend added: 'Don’t understand how people can be so vile to make someone want to take their own life, sick.'

St Michael's Park remains closed while police officers carry out their inquiries.

The cause of death is not yet known but Gloucestershire Police confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances.

A spokesman added: 'Shortly before 
12.30pm on November 7 Gloucestershire Police responded to concern for 
the welfare of a girl in St Michael’s Park in Cirencester.

'The Ambulance Service was in attendance but the girl, believed to be a 14-year-old, was pronounced dead at the scene. Her death is not being treated as suspicious.'

She said the teenager has not yet been formally identified but said next of kin have been informed.
