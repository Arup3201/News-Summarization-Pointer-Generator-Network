Two men who have appeared in court after a mosque was petrol-bombed are believed to be former soldiers, it has emerged today.

Stuart Harness, 33, and Gavin Humphries, 37, who have been remanded in custody, are thought to have served with an artillery regiment, official sources have confirmed.

It is also believed that one of the defendants spent time in Woolwich while serving in the army.

Tensions have been heightened following the brutal killing of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich last week.

The pair, from Grimsby, were arrested after Grimsby Islamic Cultural Centre was attacked for the second time in three days on Sunday while a young family was inside.

Both appeared at the town’s magistrates’ court today charged with arson with intent to endanger life.

No pleas were entered and the case will be sent to Grimsby Crown Court where it will be heard on June 7, a magistrates court official added.

The petrol-bombing was the second time the centre on Weelsby Road has been targeted since Drummer Lee Rigby was killed in Woolwich last week.

Emergency services rushed to control the blaze from spreading as Muslims were evacuated to safety

Eleven teenagers, aged 16 and 17, were arrested after a party spiralled out of control on Thursday.

In London, war memorials defaced with Islamic slogans were being cleaned up today with the veterans’ charity footing the bill.

The two monuments were targeted in London as police forces across the country dealt with a spate of attacks fuelled by hatred after soldier Lee Rigby’s murder.

The newly erected tribute to the bomber pilots of World War II was one of two central London war memorials defaced by vandals on Monday. The other was the Animals in War memorial.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
