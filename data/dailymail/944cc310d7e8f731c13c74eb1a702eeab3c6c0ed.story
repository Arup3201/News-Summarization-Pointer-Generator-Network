Steve Thomas, the 16-stone gardener who spent two hours trapped in a 15-inch gap when he fell off a ladder and got wedged upside down

A 16-stone gardener was rescued after he spent two hours trapped in a 15-inch gap when he fell off a ladder and got wedged upside-down between a wall and a shed.

Steve Thomas was cutting back fir trees in his parents' garden on Thursday morning when he slipped and plunged 10ft head first down the narrow opening.

The 34-year-old blacked out after hitting his head on a rock while his frantic worried mother and father desperately tried to free him.

Eventually the couple gave up and called firefighters - who rescued him by taking the wall down one brick at a time.

Incredibly, Mr Thomas, who lives with his parents in Worcester, suffered only grazes to his body and mild hypothermia in the freak accident.

He was rushed to hospital as a precaution but is now back at home.

He said: 'I'm quite embarrassed by it. I was on a ladder but had stood on the back of our wall, took a step back and over I went.

'I had my trainers on and they have no grip so I must have just slipped.

'I blacked out but when I came around I was upside down and I was stuck fast.

'I couldn't move, I'm 6ft 3ins and 16 stone, that's probably why I got stuck down there.

Mr Thomas added: 'I didn't realise how bad it was at first. I couldn't believe they brought the fire brigade out but I would have been there all day otherwise.

The day the wall fell: The structure had to be taken apart brick by brick by emergency services

Mind the gap: The small space that the unfortunate Mr Thomas was stuck in

'It's been a bit of a blur. I can't remember a lot of it because I hit my head on the way down and knocked myself out for a bit.

'I didn't really know what was going on, the next thing I knew I was on my way to hospital in an ambulance.

'I've got cuts and bruises all over and can't move my right arm properly yet.'

His mother Elaine, 60, a cleaner, told how she struggled with her husband Roger, 68, for an hour to free Steve before they had to call for help.

She said: 'Our next door neighbour is putting some fencing up and we thought we would cut some trees down.

'I was just holding the ladder and I turned around and he was gone.

'He tried to get out but there's a lot of rubbish in the gap.

'He got stuck on it, he's a big lad, he's 6ft 3ins.

'We tried for an hour to get him out but in the end we realised we couldn't. He got cold by then because he had been there long enough.

'I was shaking like a leaf. The fire brigade were marvellous. Thank you to them and the medical staff. They were brilliant.'

Roger, a retired railway engineer, added: 'I couldn't get at him to pull him back up. He was sort of jammed.

'It was claustrophobic.'

Firefighters from Worcester Blue Watch Fire Station and an Urban search and rescue team from Droitwich, Worcestershire, were called at 10am on Thursday to rescue Mr Thomas.

Crews used hand tools and painstakingly removed part of the wall brick by brick in order to free him.

Watch Commanded Davie Bliston said: 'He had been down there for some time.

'We took the wall down brick by brick while giving him first aid.'
