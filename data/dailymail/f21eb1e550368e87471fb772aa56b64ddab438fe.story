In just a single minute on the web 216,000 photos are shared on 
Instagram, a total of £54,000 ($83,000) sales take place on Amazon, there are 1.8 million likes on Facebook and three days worth of video is uploaded to YouTube.

Cashback site Qmee has created an infographic that shows this information as well as how many tweets are sent, photos are viewed, Skype calls are made, domains are registered and more in 60 seconds.

The graphic pulls information and figures from PC Mag, Business Insider and other sites to create a the snapshot. 

Google performs 2 million searches each minute and 72 hours worth of video is uploaded to YouTube within the space of 60 seconds.

The infographic also claims that 70 new domains are registered and 571 new website are created within a minute online, at the same time there are 1.8 million likes on Facebook, 204 million emails sent and 278,000 tweets posted.

Go-Globe.com designed a similar graphic in June last year. By comparison, the amount of emails sent has increased by 36million a minute.

There are almost four times more Google searches than a year ago, and 180,000 more tweets are sent.

YouTube video uploads have increased from 25 hours up to three days.

Relatives and friends now spend the 
equivalent of 1.4 million minutes chatting over Skype, compared to 
370,000 minutes last year.

Facebook
 figures appear to have dropped, however. This year there are on average 41,000 
status updates every second - 246,000 a minute - whereas according to 
Go-Globe's figures, this time last year the figure was in excess of 
695,000.

Exactly the same amount of domain names were created per minute in 2012 and 2013 according to the graphics.

Cashback site Qmee has created an infographic that shows how many tweets are sent, Facebook posts are liked, Skype calls are made and YouTube videos are viewed in a single minute across the internet. It used information and figures from PC Mag, Business Insider and other sites to create a 60-second snapshot

The two graphics did not use exactly the same data sources meaning that the relationship is not directly comparable but it does give an indication about which sites and services are soaring and which are staying the same, or losing favour.

The increase in posts across social networks has also seen an increase of what's been dubbed 'Twinglish'.

Social media monitoring company Brandwatch found that one in every 150 English words used on Twitter is spelt incorrectly.

On Facebook, one in 323 words are spelt incorrectly, on Google+ it's one in 238 and one in 556 words is incorrect on online forums.

Women also favour the use of elongated words  such as ‘sooooo’ and ‘loool’ on social networks.
