A 72-year-old Ohio woman is furious after she says she was kicked off a Delta flight because she 'looked sick.' 

Suzanne Hays says that she broke down in tears at Detroit's Metropolitan Airport when Delta staff told her she had to get off her plane to Orlando after the passenger next to her complained that she looked sick.

 'They said they've moved us because I might be contagious,' Ms Hays told KTLV-TV. 

'Contagious with what?'

Contagious: Suzanne Hays, 72, admits she looks pale, but says she wasn't sick when she was booted from a Delta flight

When she started to cry, a flight attendant told her that if she didn't leave the plane, the crew would call police to escort her off. 

Ms Hays admits she looks pale and that she has trouble walking, but her only health condition is a neurological disorder known as white mass disease - and it's not transmissible.

She says she wasn't sick then and isn't sick now.

But her protests fell on deaf ears aboard the plane, she told KTLV. 

'They acted like I had leprosy. It was awful I have never been treated like that in my life,' she said. 

Ms Hays says the experience was humiliating. When she begged flight attendant not to kick her off the plane, Delta staffers threatened to call the cops

Ms Hays was flying to meet her son in Florida. She had flown to Detroit from her home in Akron, Ohio, and was kicked off the connecting flight to Orlando.

Ms Hays says she was given a $20 voucher and told to buy soup and tea. She waited in the airport for an hour before Delta allowed her to board the next flight to Orlando.

She says she deserves and apology from the airline.

A Delta spokesman said the company is investigating Hay's claims and said, 'We regret the disruption that incurs from removing any passenger and our goal is to work to re-accommodate them as quickly as possible.'

Ms Hays says she has a return ticket back to Ohio on Delta and she's terrified the same thing could happen again.
