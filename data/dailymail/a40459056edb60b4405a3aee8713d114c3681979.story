A teenage boy wanted on suspicion of killing a four-month-old puppy turned himself in to police in  Dallas, Texas on Friday.

Darius Ewing, 18, allegedly poured lighter fluid on the Labrador terrier outside a Pleasant Grove apartment block on April 4.

The teen then flicked a lit cigarette at him, police said, causing burns which covered more than 70 per cent of his body.

Police launched a man hunt for Ewing and witnesses came forward claiming to have seen a group of people, led by the teen, burning Justice.

They offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for burning Justice, according to Examiner.com.

Justice: Ewing turned himself into police in Dallas, Texas on Friday after an arrest warrant was issued. Authorities were offering a $25,000 reward for information about the slaying

Officers went to the house where Ewing had been staying with his great grandmother but were told he no longer lived there after failing to follow her rules. 

Friend and neighbour Jacoby Cooper told Fox 4: ‘He was on rehab. They was trying to get him to stop doing drugs but he ran away from rehab and he stopped going’.

Cooper, who grew up with Ewing, added: ‘I really don’t think he would do something like that unless he was under the influence.

‘He do crazy stuff but I don’t think he would do that.’

Outraged animal lovers gathered 
outside Dallas City Hall in support of the pup, named Justice by rescue 
workers, when he died 10 days after the brutal attack.

As hundreds of people held a moving candlelight vigil Ewing handed himself in.

David Alex,
a special prosecutor in the district attorney's office, said to NBC: 'The timing was great.

'Hopefully, a 
lot of it had to do with the pressure from the community to do the right
thing.'

Ewing is charged with felony animal cruelty. If convicted he faces up to 10 years in jail.

Police showed up at Ewing's great grandmother's house in southeast Dallas with a warrant for his arrest but she told officer's she had kicked him out when he failed to follow her rules
