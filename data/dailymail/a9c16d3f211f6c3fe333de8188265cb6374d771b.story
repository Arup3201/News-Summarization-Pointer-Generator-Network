Kraft Foods Group is recalling 242,000 boxes of Original flavor of 'Kraft' Macaroni & Cheese because some of the boxes may contain small pieces of metal, the company said Tuesday.

The food group announced in a news release Tuesday that officials have received eight consumer complaints about the particular product, but no injuries have been reported. 

'We deeply regret this situation and apologize to any consumers we have disappointed,' the company said in the statement.

The recall is limited to the 7.25-ounce size of the Original flavor with 'Best When Used By' dates of September 18, 2015 through October 11, 2015. 

The recalled boxes have a code 'C2' below the date on each individual box, the company said. 

The 'C2' refers to the specific production line on which the product was made. 

No other 'Kraft' products are included in the recall.

However, some packages of the Original flavor of 'Kraft' Macaroni & Cheese were sold in multi-pack units that have a range of different code dates and manufacturing codes.

The product was shipped by the company to customers across the U.S., Puerto Rico, and some Caribbean and South American countries -- but not to Canada, according to the release.

'Consumers who purchased this product should not eat it,' the company said.

'They should return it to the store where purchased for an exchange or full refund.' 

The company is one of North America's largest consumer packaged food and beverage companies and boasts annual revenues of more than $18 billion.
