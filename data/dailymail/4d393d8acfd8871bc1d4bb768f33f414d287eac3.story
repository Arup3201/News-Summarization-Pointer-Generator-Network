Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik 
has a rare, high-functioning form of Asperger's that has left him 
incapable of empathy or real friendship, one of Norway's most prominent 
psychiatrists has told a court in Oslo.

Professor Ulrik Fredrik Malt of Olso University told the court: 'It is plausible that there is Asperger's, Tourette's, and a narcissistic personality disorder.'

As
 evidence, he cited the lack of emotion Breivik showed when discussing 
those he killed, his impressive memory for details, his obsession with 
numbers, his hypergraphia [obsessive writing], and his monotonous tone 
of voice.

Testimony: Ulrik Fredrik Malt, a professor of psychiatry, testifies in the case against terror and murder charged Anders Behring Breivik at a court in Oslo

Deliberation: Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen listens to arguments today as legal teams debate the sanity of Breivik. The defendant himself has instructed his lawyers to fight that he is sane

All of these, he said, were evidence of 'functional disorders of the brain lobes'.

Breivik angrily interrupted Professor Malt's testimony, complaining that his claims were 'insulting' and 'abusive'.

But when given the opportunity to comment at the end of the day, he was cooly ironic. 

He said: 'I would like to congratulate Professor Malt for his well-executed character assassination.

Aspergers: Breivik reacted with anger at claims he was suffering mental illness, saying that the testimony of Professor Malt was 'insulting'

'In the beginning I was quite offended, but in the end I thought it was pretty funny. The premises outlined are not true.'

The
 33-year-old extremist has instructed his lawyers to fight for him to be
 declared sane, even though this would mean he spends the next 21 years 
in prison, rather than in a secure mental hospital.

As he has confessed to killing 77 people during his massacre last July, his sanity is the key question at the trial.

Professor
 Malt argued that Breivik did not appear to suffer from the absurd, 
bizarre delusions or hallucinations normal for a schizophrenic, so he 
did not agree with the conclusions of the first psychiatic report 
received by the court, which concluded he was insane.

But
 he agreed that Breivik could not be treated as responsible for his 
actions, contradicting a second psychiatric report, which argued Breivik
 was criminally accountable.

Prfessor
 Malt said: 'It is important that we take on board that this is 
something much more than only a pure right-wing extremist.

'It
 is a tragedy for Norway, and for us. But I believe it is also a tragedy
 for Breivik. The first time I saw Breivik coming into the hall, I did 
not see a monster. I saw a deeply lonely man.'

He said that Asperger's would explain the problems Breivik's mother had 
with her son when he was four years old, leading the two of them to 
spend several months staying at Norway's National Center for Child and 
Adolescent Psychiatry.

Breivik's
 mother, Wench Behring, has also described him as being constantly 
thirsty, a symptom Professor Malt said was frequently displayed by young
 Asperger's sufferers.

Breivik's
 violent acts could also be the result of a version of Tourette's 
syndrome, which is associated with Asperger's. He said had observed that
 Breivik suffered frequent suppressed tics.

Prosecution: Director of public prosecutions, Tor Aksel Busch (left), and public prosecutor Svein Holden arrive in court today to hear the testimony of mental health experts

Force: This photo shows members of the Norwegian Special Forces land by boat on the shore of the island of Utoya during Breivik's shooting spree

Tributes: The Norwegian killed 77 people on July 22 last year, first detonating a car bomb in Oslo, then going on a shooting rampage at a camp on Utoya Island (background)

Asperger's
 support groups in Norway have attacked previous attempts to attribute 
Breivik's massacre to the condition, arguing that there is no evidence 
that Asperger's is associated with increased criminality or violence.

Norway's Dagbladet newspaper was forced to publish an official apology in February, after it failed to make this clear.

The trial continues.
