Carson, the formidable butler at Downton Abbey, would never tolerate such chaos and confusion.

But the real-life lady of Downton – Lady Carnarvon of Highclere Castle, where the ITV drama is filmed – has revealed how things fell apart when staff were given the evening off on Christmas Day.

Recounting tales of poor plate washing, badly set tables and dogs that chew the TV remote, she confessed that the reality of Christmas at Highclere was far removed from the calm scenes portrayed on the small screen.

In her blogs on the Highclere Castle website, Lady Carnarvon condemned her husband’s attempts at washing up, saying it was ‘not completely diligent’.

‘In fact Diana our housekeeper rejected quite a few bowls the following morning when she kept finding the remains of soup glueing them together,’ she said.

Lady Carnarvon also chided guests for not concentrating on laying the table for breakfast the following morning. And she disclosed how her dogs chewed the TV remote control, causing the family to miss nearly 40 minutes of the two-hour Downton Abbey Christmas special.

Speaking later to The Mail on Sunday, Lady Carnarvon said her husband had been ‘taken aback by my blog’ criticising his washing up, adding: ‘He said it wasn’t him.’
