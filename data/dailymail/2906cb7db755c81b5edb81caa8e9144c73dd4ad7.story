A Spanish explorer has been rescued after spending nearly two weeks trapped 1,300ft underground in a Peruvian cave.

Cecilio Lopez had been lying injured in the cave, named Intimachay, in Peru's northern Amazonas region, where the temperature can drop as low as 10 degrees Celsius and humidity reaches 100 per cent.

But after 12 days deep underground, the 44-year-old cave explorer  was pulled to safety to cheers from an international team of 107 rescuers.

After 12 days  underground, the 44-year-old cave explorer was pulled to safety to cheers from an international team of 107 rescuers

Members of the team, who included 58 Spaniards, hugged each other in excitement as Mr Lopez emerged out of the mouth of the cave.

Mr Lopez was hurt when he fell 16ft inside the cave in a ravine in Leimebamba district, 376 miles northeast of the capital, Lima. 

During the rescue operation,  coordinator James Apaestegui said a doctor had reached Lopez and found the well-known cave explorer had two damaged lumbar vertebrae that limit his movement.

He was said to be lying face-up where he had fallen but could not stand up. 

Rescuers said they had been getting food, water and medicine to Lopez, but his extraction was made difficult by the remoteness of the cave and the cavern itself, which narrows at places.

But a solution was eventually found and after being pulled to the surface he was carried into a tent and kept lying on the rescue stretcher. 

Peruvian civil defence officials said he would be flown by an air force helicopter to Lima.

After being lifted from the cave with a pulley, Mr Lopez, a speleologist, said that he hopes to get well enough soon to
continue exploring caves in the area, rescue worker Javier Farje told
Reuters.

Scores of rescuer workers, including some of his Spanish
colleagues, travelled to South America to help in the rescue effort.
