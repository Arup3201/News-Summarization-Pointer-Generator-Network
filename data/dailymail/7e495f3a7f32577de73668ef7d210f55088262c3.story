A convicted felon charged with kidnapping and killing an Arkansas real estate agent proclaimed his innocence in this week’s jailhouse interview, telling a reporter that Beverly Carter's death was 'an accident.'

Arron Michael Lewis, 33, was arrested two weeks ago in connection to the disappearance and slaying of Carter, a married mother of two, who vanished after meeting with Lewis to show him a house.

Carter's body was discovered five days later buried on the grounds of a concrete company in the town of Cabot.

Speaking to a KARK-TV reporter, Lewis insisted that Carter went with him willingly, and that whatever happened to her was an accident

Lewis, an ex-convict with a lengthy criminal history, was apprehended by police September 29 and charged with capital murder, kidnapping and gun possession. He pleaded not guilty to all counts. 

Speaking to a reporter from KARK-TV this week from jail, Mr Lewis, clad in all white and sitting behind a glass divider, stated: 'I didn't murder her, and anything that did occur was an accident.

Arron Lewis pleaded not guilty to capital murder in the slaying of real estate agent Beverly Carter in rural Arkansas 

'I never denied her going with me, [but] as far as kidnapping, I've never kidnapped anybody.'

Asked about his meeting with Mrs Carter on the day of her disappearance September 25, Lewis said it had nothing to do with her showing the house.

The 33-year-old reiterated that he did not put Beverly Carter in his car by force.

'I mean, somebody goes with your of their own free will, they're not being kidnapped,' he told the reporter.

Sounding a defiant note, Lewis accused the prosecution of trying to pin the murder on him simply based on his past misdeeds, including convictions of credit card fraud and theft.

'It's not as clean-cut as they're wrapping it up to be,' Lewis said.

The murder suspect added that while he has an extensive rap sheet, he is not the cold-blooded killer that the prosecutors are making him out to be.

‘My lawyer said that we're taking a beating in the media,’ Lewis lamented. ‘My response to him was I'm not taking a beating in the media - I'm being crucified.’ 

Investigators found the body of Beverly Carter September 30 at Argos Concrete Company in a rural area about 25 miles northeast of Little Rock.

Hours later, Arron Lewis was charged with capital murder, kidnapping and multiple counts of gun possession.  

Carter's body was found more than 20 miles away from Scott, where she had an appointment to show a house five days earlier.

Perp walk: Lewis is seen here been led in handcuffs to a car that would transport him to Pulaski County Jail

Lewis was apprehended in Little Rock by the local police at around 10am September 29 in connection with the case.

As he was being led in handcuffs to a car to be transported to Pulaski County Jail, a KARK reporter asked Lewis if he killed Beverly Carter.

'No,' he replied, adding that he has not seen her for two days.

In response to a reporter's question 'why Beverly?' he replied: 'Because she was just a woman that worked alone, a rich broker.' 

It's understood that Lewis did not give up the location of the body, but that police received a tip that led them to the makeshift burial site in the 12100 block of Highway 5 in Cabot. 

Following the devastating discovery, the Carter family released a statement  mourning the loss of their 'precious Beverly.'

'There is now a hole in our hearts that will never be filled,' the statement read. 'Mr Lewis robbed us of an amazing wife, loving mother and grandmother.' 

The Little Rock blog Forbidden Hillcrest tweeted that Lewis was captured in Pleasant Pointe apartments on Green Mountain Drive after allegedly pulling a knife on a bystander. 

A passerby recognized Lewis from the news coverage and approached him, sending the man fleeing towards the Pleasant Pointe apartments.

As responding officers arrived outside the building, Lewis allegedly burst into the manager's office and jumped out the window in an attempt to flee, but was immediately caught.

Lewis was named as a 'person of interest' after being involved in a car accident and taken to a hospital by police - before fleeing while officers thought he was having a CT scan done.

Authorities released images of Lewis, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, with blood on his face following the crash in a bid to track him down.

According to the Pulaski County Sheriff's Office, deputies received a call at around 10am September 28 about a single-vehicle crash in the 8700 block of Cato Road in Jacksonville, in which Arron Lewis' vehicle smashed into a concrete culvert.

A bloodied Mr Lewis reportedly told the responding officers that someone had run him off the road.

A witness told investigators that Lewis was driving at a high speed when he lost control of his vehicle in a curve, KARK reported..

Notorious: Lewis has criminal records in several states, including Arkansas, Missouri and Utah 

The sheriff's office also has revealed that the 33-year-old is an active parolee with a long criminal history, including charges of felony theft; accomplice to theft; unlawful removal of theft device; obstruction of government operations, and other counts.

Lewis also has rap sheets in Kansas City, Missouri, and in Utah. He was released on parole in Arkansas in August 2013.

Earlier, Mrs Carter's husband of 35 years, Carl, made a tearful plea for authorities and residents to do all they can to find her.

Mr Carter found his wife's car abandoned outside the house, which was left unlocked and open.

Tragic: Mrs Carter was a realtor with Crye-Leike in Little Rock, Arkansas

Mr Carter, who raised the alarm after his wife didn't come back from her appointment after three and a half hours, has since received unusual text messages from her phone, but no other sign of her.

Describing the moments he went to look for her, he told KARK: 'By eight o'clock I knew something was wrong - but I waited to eight thirty. I went up in the house, went through every closet, everything.' 

Matriarch: Beverly Carter has been married for 34 years and has four grandchildren 

Property: Mrs Carter was showing this property in Scott, Arkansas, to an unknown buyer who reportedly said he would be willing to pay in cash

According to ABC News, the home had been foreclosed, and Mrs Carter, who worked for the Crye-Leike real estate company in Little Rock, was showing it to a buyer she had never met, who said he could pay in cash.

Her husband said that he received unusual texts from her number at 1am the morning after she disappeared. 

He said: 'All of a sudden I received three texts in a row. One said "Yes." Then she sent another text that said, "My phone's low. The battery's down, and I'll call you whenever I get signal."

'And, then, straight back-to-back, I received a text that said "Oh, I'm out drinking with some friends."'

'Beverly's not a drinker…We just want our mom back, and my wife of 35 years…I need her.'
