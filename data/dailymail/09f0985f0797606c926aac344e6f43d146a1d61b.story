'I like to keep myself busy and I have always enjoyed being at work. It's so good to still be active. It keeps the cogs moving and keeps me young.

'The girls in the office are lovely. They look after me and give me a lift home.

'I have never wanted to stop working. My favourite job ever was working for the MOD it was often top secret and was skilled work.

'But I have been in this job now 34 years and everyone here feels like my extended family.

'I have a laugh with the girls in the office, I pull their leg and they pull mine. My day to day tasks consist of making the tea and coffee, answering the phones, shredding all the old papers and filing.

'They really look after me here and make sure that I'm okay day to day. I'm very grateful that they have kept me on into old age and I certainly have no plans to retire yet.'

Jim, who was born as one of eight children, went to school in High Wych, Hertfordshire, before leaving aged 14 to begin an apprenticeship in engineering.

During the war years Jim worked at the Ernest Lake Ltd factory in nearby Bishop's Stortford making torpedoes.

It was there he met his wife Gladys, the couple married in 1944 and were together until she passed away 19 years ago.

Jacky Cowley said: 'Jim is amazing. He still works two days a week helping out in the office.

'Everyone who works with him is gobsmacked that he is 100 because he only looks in his 80s.

Jim has two children called Barry and Susan, four grandchildren, Ashley, Adam, Mark and Samantha and a great-granddaughter, Georgia.
