A shocking new advert is warning people not to drink soda - in case they might lose a limb.

The posters from New York City's Health Department warn the public that they might have to have an arm or leg amputated if they consume too many fizzy drinks.

Such an unhealthy habit can cause diabetes which in extreme cases can lead to amputations.

Big controversy: A grim new advertisement to fight obesity created on behalf of the New York City Department of Health links amputations to sugary sodas

The adverts have already been attacked by soda makers for painting an 'inaccurate picture' of what the drink does to the body.

But New York health chiefs - and the city's mayor Michael Bloomberg - insist it is a necessary shock tactic.

City officials have put up 1,000 of the posters on the subway which show a man with Type 2 diabetes who has lost his right leg sitting behind a chart showing how soda portions have gradually got bigger.

Mayor Bloomberg has defended the controversial ads, saying, 'What do you want to do? Do you want to have people lose their legs?'

The caption reads: 'Portions have grown. So has Type 2 diabetes, which can lead to amputations'.

Stefan Friedman, a spokesman for the American Beverage Association, said the campaign was over the top.

He
said: 'Instead of utilizing scare tactics, the beverage industry is 
offering real solutions like smaller portioned containers and new 
calorie labels'

But in a press conference Mr Bloomberg said: 'What do you want to do? Do you want to have people lose their legs?

'Or do you want to show them what happens so that they won't lose their legs? Take your poison. Which do you want?'

America's obesity crisis shows no sign of abating.

Around one-third of U.S. adults are obese as are 17 per cent of children and adolescents aged between two and 19.

This
has in part explained how 25.8 million children and adults in the 
United States - 8.3 per cent of the population - now have diabetes.

Whilst most cases can be managed with insulin injections, around 65,000 people each year have to lose a limb due to the illness.

New York City is one of the most draconian places in America when it comes to policing the health of its citizens.

Mr Bloomberg is reportedly considering a crack down on the number of licensed premises and has already banning smoking in public places like parks and beaches.

Adverts already running on the subway show how many miles a person would have to walk to work off the calories from fatty kinds of coffees.

New Yorkers have also been forced to look at an anti-obesity advert showing people drinking a glass full of human fat to dissuade them from eating junk food.

Atlanta also recently sparked controversy when it put posters up warning about the dangers of childhood obesity with the slogan: 'Big bones didn't make me this way, big meals did'

Another poster with a picture of an overweight girl read: 'It's hard to be a little girl if you're not'.

New York's Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said: 'The portion sizes (of soda) that are marketed are often much more than humans need.

'We are warning people about the risks of super-size portions so they can make more informed choices about what they eat.'
