A passenger who feared he would miss his plane set off a fire alarm at a busy airport to stop it taking off - sparking an emergency evacuation.

Passengers and workers gathered on the tarmac at London City Airport after the unidentified traveller triggered the alarm yesterday afternoon, hoping the plane to Germany would be grounded.

Unfortunately for them, the late-running passenger's desperate act was unveiled and he was detained by staff.

Alert: A passenger was so desperate not to miss his plane from London City Airport he triggered a fire alarm to try and keep it grounded. Pictured, staff and passengers gather on the tarmac during the evacuation

A spokesperson for London City Airport said:  'A late-running passenger trying to stop a flight to Frankfurt triggered the fire alarm.

'The alarm was triggered around 2.45pm and a full evacuation carried out.  The source was immediately identified and staff and passengers were able to re-enter the building around 15 minutes later

'Once an aircraft has started its engines there’s little you can do to get onboard if you’re late, short of clinging to the undercarriage - which we obviously wouldn’t recommend.'

'Words fail': Airport staff took to Twitter to express their disbelief at the passenger's desperate act

Alarm: A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said officers were called to London City Airport yesterday afternoon but no arrests were made

They added: 'Lovely though Frankfurt is, the person who triggered the alarm will probably, with hindsight, wish they had taken it on the chin and re-booked as the matter was taken up by police.'

Yesterday, the airport's official Twitter account tweeted: 'Today's fire alarm caused by late running pax trying to stop a flight! Pushed the button - caused a full evacuation. Words fail...'

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said officers were called but no arrests were made.

Twitter user Christophe Wuyts posted a picture of a crowd stood on the tarmac with planes nearby, writing: 'Fire alarm at London city airport. Building evacuated. Passengers on tarmac.'
