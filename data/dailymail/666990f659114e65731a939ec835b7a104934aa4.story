Brooks wrote to Coulson: 'I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you.'

The full letter exposing the affair between Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson was given to the phone hacking jury for the first time today.

In the letter, Brooks, 45, told Coulson 'I love you' as she pours her heart out over the end of their six-year relationship, it is said.

Jurors at the Old Bailey were today handed the two-and-a-half page document - but were required to read in silence the first part of the letter, which will not now be heard in open court.

Brooks, seated next to husband Charlie, and Coulson, 46, both stared ahead intently as the document, in which Brooks writes: 'You are my very best friend', was read.

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC then repeated the extract he had already read when he addressed the jury at the start of the trial, in early November.

Brooks writes: 'You are my very best friend. I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you.'

It is claimed the pair, who are on trial for phone hacking together, dated in secret between 1998 and 2004.

Mr Edis repeated those passages again in open court today after revealing that the document had been recovered from one of Brooks' computers.

Writing to Coulson, she says: 'Finally and the least of our worries, but how do we really work this new relationship?

'There are a hundred things that have happened since Saturday night that I would normally share with you, some important, most trivial.

'The fact is you are my very best 
friend. I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I 
love you, care about you, worry about you.

'We laugh and cry together. In fact without our relationship in my life, I am really not sure how I will cope.

Brooks, seated next to husband Charlie, stared ahead intently as the document, in which she wrote: 'You are my very best friend', was read

'I'm frightened to be without you, but bearing in mind "the rules" you will not know how I am doing and vice versa.

'The thought of finding out anything about you or your life from someone else fills me with absolute dread.

'Also you said I had to email you if anything important happened, like if I was ill?

'I don't understand this, we are either there for each other or not surely?

'Anyway, that really isn't where I am confused. I know what horror it means and I know why we have to stick to it.

'But for example, how does this work thing manifest itself.

Rebekah Brooks' phone was hacked 43 times by News of the World investigator Glenn Mulcaire in 2006, the court heard. 

The convicted phone hacker was also listening to Andy Coulson's voicemails at the same time, even hacking him six times on a single day. Brooks' maiden name, Rebekah Wade, appeared several times in Mulcaire's notes recovered by police.

On one page, he had an account number alongside her name, a list of mobile phone service providers, and the word 'Vodafone'.

Another page with Brooks' name had her mobile number and the names of ex-husband Ross Kemp and former News International lawyer Tom Crone.

Mulcaire had made notes on Coulson but misspelt his name as 'Coulsdon', the court heard.

Phone records show that Brooks was hacked 13 times in March 2006, 15 times in April, another ten times in May, and five times in June and July.

Coulson was targeted six times on February 1, 2006, and another five times later in the month. His voicemails were hacked another eight times in June and July 2006, the court heard.

Mr Edis showed this data in agreed admission presented to the jury at the close of the prosecution case. 

'Do we limit contact until we absolutely have to, like leaving our execs to sort run-of-the-mill joint stuff? I don't want to get this wrong.

'I hope that I've managed to put your mind at rest about Les, and that you two now have a better relationship.

'On KRM [Rupert Murdoch], well he's not b*llocking you must not brood on lack of calls.

'Obviously I can't discuss my worries, concerns, problems at work with you anymore, and vice versa, but I'll assume unless I hear different that we keep our professional relationship to the minimum, and avoid if possible without it being in any way awkward.

'If it is necessary or more importantly right that we two editors should deal with it, then we will. If either of us feels that we are not striking this balance then we must say.'

The letter was presented to the jury as the prosecution case draws to a close.

This is the third time in the trial the unusual step of asking jurors to read evidence in silence has been taken.

It was first used over privacy concerns with voicemails left by former Home Secretary David Blunkett, and again for two email exchanges involving journalists at The Sun.

The court also heard how Brooks emailed ex-husband Ross Kemp saying they needed to ‘talk about phone hacking’ three weeks before her arrest.

The email to the former Eastenders actor was recovered from Brooks’ BlackBerry mobile phone, having been sent at 11.03pm on June 23, 2011.

‘Hello, how are you?’, she wrote. ‘Need to talk to you about phone hacking at some point. When are you free?’

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC then told jurors that less than half an hour later, Brooks emailed her personal assistants Deborah Keegan and Cheryl Carter saying: ‘Need my 2002/03 diaries.’

The emails were taken off the BlackBerry seized from Brooks when she was first arrested on July 17, 2011.

Another email is to Carter on July 8, 2011, saying: ‘Coffee and hot milk please, separately. This is disgusting.’

Jurors at the Old Bailey were today handed the two-and-a-half page document from Brooks to Coulson - but were forced to in silence the first part of the letter, which will not now be heard in open court

Mr Edis said: ‘This is the day of the withdrawal of the notebooks from the archive’, referring to the charge that Brooks and Carter face together.

The jury heard many of Brooks’ emails have been lost forever because she did not agree for them to be kept in an archive.

The former News International chief executive decided not to ‘opt in’ to an automatic archive system when it was installed in 2005.

As a result, very few of her emails over six years at News International including four years as editor of The Sun have been recovered by police.

Prosecutor Mark Bryant-Heron told the court: ‘Mrs Brooks never opted in to using News International’s original archive system when it was installed in January 2005.

‘This meant emails on Mrs Brooks’ email account were not retained on the archiving system.

‘Emails sent to her and received from her by other employees would be retained on the system in those users’ own archiving system, unless deleted by that user within 14 days.’

He added the ‘percentage of her account recovered cannot be confirmed.’

The court heard police investigating phone hacking at the News of the World and corruption at The Sun have recovered four batches of emails from the News International system.

One was the ‘live email archive’ from 2000 to 2007, there are two systems that have been rebuilt, and a back-up system.

The court heard that nearly 4.5m emails from 2005 to 2010 were purged by News International as part of a routine clean-out in September 2010, but 1.49m had subsequently been recovered from other sources.

Jurors also heard that Brooks’ old hard drive from her office in Wapping was removed prior to the computer being disposed of.

The removal happened after the News International executive moved to new offices in Thomas More Square in January 2011, and were issued with new computers.

However, on an audit in May 2011, it was discovered there was no hard drive in Brooks’ now redundant computer.

The computer was then thrown away because Brooks’ name was not on a list of phone hacking suspects whose computer equipment was being preserved.

After today, the trial will take a break for several days of legal discussions before resuming on Monday, February 17 when the defence cases are due to begin.

Rebekah Brooks, of Chipping Norton, Coulson, of Charing, Kent, and Kuttner, of Woodford Green, Essex all deny of one count of conspiracy to intercept communications.

Brooks also denies two counts of perverting the course of justice and two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office.

Coulson, with Clive Goodman, of Woodham, Addlestone, Surrey, also denies two counts of misconduct in a public office.

Carter, of Chelmsford, Essex, Hanna, of Buckingham, Bucks, and Charles Brooks, of Chipping Norton all deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

The trial has now been adjourned for legal argument until Monday, February 17.
