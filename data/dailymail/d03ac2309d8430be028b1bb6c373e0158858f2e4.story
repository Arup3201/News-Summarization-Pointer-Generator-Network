One minute you're walking down an alleyway minding your own business... and then you bump into a man who sneezes and his head falls off. And then he tries to re-attach it to his body.

But always expect the unexpected on Halloween, as the residents of San Luis Obispo, California, found out.

Magician Rich Ferguson performed his 'head drop' trick on the streets of his hometown.

Now, his illusion, and the hilarious reactions of unsuspecting strangers, has become a YouTube monster smash, with almost 4million hits.

Mr Ferguson, aka The Ice Breaker, decided to stage his grisly prank during the day because, as he said, 'night is a more vulnerable setting and it freaks people out big time'.

During the performance, there is no shoving up of the jacket - his upper clothing stays perfectly in place as his head 'falls off'.

It was greeted with mixed reactions: some women screamed, children ran away, while others remained non-plussed.

And the reaction? Women screamed and cowered in fear...

Schoolchildren fled the scene in terror...

... while others just laughed it off

The award-winning magician wrote on YouTube: 'Having way too much fun this season with pranks and street magic. Watch out, we are coming for you!'

He added: 'They do say "trick or treat?" I say trick!'

How is the illusion possible? Possibly a combination of yoga and many hours of practice - but a good magician never tells.
