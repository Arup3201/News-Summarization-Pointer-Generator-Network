The father of a missing south London girl who is feared to have travelled to Syria has made a desperate plea for her to come home.

Abdirashiid Dirie, from Stockwell, has urged his 17-year-old daughter Samya to return, saying 'nobody's against you'.

The college student is believed to have flown out of Heathrow airport with 15-year-old Bristol girl Yusra Hussien nearly two weeks ago.

Yusra Hussien, 15, (pictured above) is though to have fled to Syria with London teenager Samya Dirie, 17, whose father has now appealed for her to return home

Safiya Hussien (centre), Yusra's mother, spoke at a press conference with the girl's aunt's Sucdis Ali (left) and Ikram Mohamed, last week

Mr Dirie said: 'What I'm saying, as a dad, come back. Nobody's against you. It is not true, nobody's going to arrest you.

'You're a young girl and they know that. The police also know that, they've even said that in the newspaper. You haven't committed any crime.

'Come back safely. That place (Syria) is not good for you. You can carry on your education. I want you to come back, as a father.

'You are after paradise by going there, but you will achieve paradise by pleasing your parents.'

He told BBC News he believes she met the Bristol teenager on the internet and must have been influenced by extremists online.

The police say they want the teenagers to come home and this case is about missing young girls, not a crime.

Miss Dirie, a student from south London, disappeared after telling her parents she was going on an early morning trip to a university with her college.

They then discovered that her passport and money was missing and now believe that she is too scared to come home.

Miss Dirie called a cousin a few days ago, possibly from Turkey, and said she is safe.

Mr
 Dirie said: 'She told her she is somewhere far away, and she did not 
say where she is, she also said she was afraid of the police if she 
comes back.'

It is feared the teenage girls may have joined ISIS extremists in Syria (pictured) after being radicalised online

Her mother, Sahra, said: 'The police are doing all they can to find her. She's a lovely girl. We just hope they can find her.'

A
 family friend added: 'The whole family is very shaken up. She's an 
educated girl and she didn't even go out much in Britain so they cannot 
understand why she has gone to Syria.

'They had no idea she was interested in Syria or Jihad. She was happy to be in Britain and wants to be a lawyer.'

The mother of fellow runaway Yusra broke down in tears in an emotional press conference last week as she begged her daughter - who has not been seen since she leaving her family home for school on September 24 - to come home.

She said: 'Yusra, I am your mum, I love you. Please, please, please, we miss you, come back.

'I love you so much. All your brothers and your sister miss you so, so much. The house is not the same.'

Family friends previously said they believed Yusra, who wears a hijab as part of her faith, had become radicalised on chat rooms and forums online. It is not yet clear how she met 17-year-old Miss Dirie.

Yusra's parents have stressed that nothing has been proven about their daughter's beliefs.
