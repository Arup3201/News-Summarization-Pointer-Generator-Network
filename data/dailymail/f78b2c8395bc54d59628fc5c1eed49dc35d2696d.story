Confrontation: Michael Schmidt was shot by police after barricading himself in an apartment lobby

A Dallas lawyer was shot dead by police after he reported a burglary at his home and then barricaded himself in the apartment complex lobby.

Police claim Michael Edward Schmidt started to fire at them when they responded to calls of a break in at about 1.45am on Thursday.

Mr Schmidt, whose 20-year marriage had recently ended, was shot as he approached police during the confrontation.

No one else was injured in the shootout, but Mr Schmidt's 11-year-old daughter was in his Glass House by Windsor apartment at the time.

The shooting took place in the building's lobby and resulted in the windows being shattered by gunfire.

The incident began when Mr Schmidt, 47, allegedly told an employee in the complex that his apartment was being broken into.

But when police arrived, the father-of-four is said to have barricaded himself in the main lobby, where witnesses claim he fired several shots.

Officers told Dallas News they tried to negotiate with Mr Schmidt but when he continued to shoot at them, they fired back.

Mr Schmidt, who represented clients in medical negligence cases at his father's law firm, had recently separated from his wife.

The couple had started dating when they were teenagers and had four children together.

He was a leading lawyer, having been voted Super Lawyer seven years in a row and was listed as one of the 500 Leading Lawyers of America.

His mother-in-law, Susan McMordie said 
she was shocked to hear of his death, and added that the family were 
thankful that his daughter had not been physically injured in the 
confrontation.

'It’s very shocking in the way that it 
happened. He was such a sweet guy,' she said. 'He was a 
very generous person, and he just had some problems along the way.'

Residents at the luxury apartment complex were woken by the shooting.

Grant Threadgill told NBC 5 that after hearing gun fire he looked out his window and saw police cars.

'Death is always unfortunate. I feel like the cops were probably protecting themselves,' he said.
