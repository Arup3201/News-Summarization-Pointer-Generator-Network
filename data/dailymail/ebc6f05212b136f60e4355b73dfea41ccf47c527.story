Former prime minister Gough Whitlam's childhood home was expected to be demolished within weeks

The house where former prime minister Gough Whitlam is believed to have been born on the kitchen table 98 years ago is set to be demolished and possibly replaced by a 'McMansion'.

The three-bedroom home in the affluent suburb of Kew, in east Melbourne, which went under the hammer for $3.3million last year, was given the tick of approval to be ripped down just one week before Whitlam passed away on Tuesday.

Whitlam's parents took out a house mortgage at the beginning of 1915 and the home was built by May that same year.

Boroondara council attempted to save the home after declaring it was of 'local individual heritage significance' due to Whitlam living in the house for the first two years of his life until the family moved to Sydney with his father's job in 1918.  

The council received a demolition order for the 46 Rowland Street site, known as 'Ngara,' in April followed by a nomination for heritage protection of the house later that month.

Following an investigation, the council deemed the home as heritage-worthy due to Whitlam's childhood links to the property before it lodged a heritage protection request to the Victorian Planning Minister in May.

However, the planning department rejected the application in September because the demolition order was already approved before receiving the heritage request, the ABC reported.

The house, built in 1915, at 46 Rowland Street has been relatively untouched since the 1920s

The home in the affluent suburb of Kew was sold for $3.3million in November last year

A order to demolish the property was issued by a private builder just seven days before Whitlam's passing on Tuesday, The Age reported.

Following the sale last year, the home was listed on realestate.com.au as displaying 'splendid original character and grand room proportions offer endless scope to renovate/extend or perhaps create a luxurious new home.' 

Former owner Gerald Swinnerton, who sold the house in January, met Whitlam, along with his parents, when the politician visited his childhood home in the 1960s.

'He turned up in a Commonwealth car,' Mr Swinnerton told the ABC.

'We had afternoon tea together, and found him to be a charming and congenial fellow.'

The Whitlams took a mortgage out from the State Savings Bank of Victoria on 30 January 1915 to build the family home which was completed by May that same year, the Property Observer reported.

The announcement of Whitlam's birth was published as taking place at Ngara, Rowland Street, East Kew. 

Legend has it - that Whitlam was delivered on the kitchen table in the home the following year after it was built.

However, two years after his birth, the family uprooted to Sydney after his father, Fred Whitlam, was promoted to deputy Crown solicitor

Mr Swinnerton said before he and his brother made the sale they expressed their preference for the new owner to only make renovations to the house.

'It's my view that a plaque should be placed in the pavement outside the house,' he said.

Neighbour Oliver Barrett said he expected the house, which has been relatively untouched since the 1920s, to be pulled down within a couple of weeks as the demolition process had already begun.

He said the fact that many people had visited the home since Whitlam died proved its historical significance.

'We'll lose a large bit of Australian history,' he told the ABC. 

The house currently features a large formal living and dining room - along with a sun room and box and bay windows.
