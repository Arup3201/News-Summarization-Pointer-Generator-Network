Mary Berry was mystified by the use of hemp flour – made from cannabis plants – on the Great British Bake Off this week.

But given the plant’s myriad nutritional benefits, she might want to make it a kitchen staple.

Hemp seeds, from which it is milled, are high in protein, fibre and healthy fats.

A research review found that a high intake could help tackle heart disease, improve cholesterol levels and reduce blood clot formation.

Hemp seeds also increase levels of important fatty acids in the blood, as the seeds are high in omega-3 and omega-6.

But scientists report that legal issues and misunderstandings have slowed research progress.

Mary, can rest easy, however, for hemp is safe – and legal – as it’s derived from a variety of cannabis that doesn’t contain the psychoactive ingredient THC.

People who think they protect the family from their cigarette smoke by lighting up only when home alone might need to think again. Studies suggest tobacco residue stays in a room long after the smoker has gone.

Researchers in California tested hotel rooms in which smoking was allowed and found levels of tobacco by-products up  to 75 times higher than in hotels that  banned smoking.

Non-smokers stayed in hotels overnight, and finger-wipe analysis afterwards found nicotine on their skin, with the highest levels in those who stayed in ‘smoking’ rooms – suggesting that cigarette residue lingers in the air and on surfaces.

Running along: Spencer Matthews

Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews is swapping champagne and canapes for cereal bars and protein shakes, and running the New York Marathon in a bid to lose weight.

Spencer, 25, confessed: ‘Ever since I was young my weight has fluctuated and I put on pounds more easily than I’d like.

'I live life to extremes and when I am in party boy mode, drinking and eating to excess, it can creep on pretty quickly.

'I’ve signed up to the marathon so I have an incentive to run.’

Spencer will be flying to the US for the event, on November 3, with personal trainer Shane Collins, who works with singer Natalie Imbruglia and TV presenter  Zoe Hardman.

But there is one problem: ‘I suffer from shin splints,’ Spencer says.

Nearly 60 per cent of womb cancer cases could be prevented if women exercised for at least 30 minutes a day and kept off excess body fat.

And the UK-based World Cancer Research Fund International warns that eating lots of high-GI foods, such as sugar and processed food, increases cancer risk as obesity affects hormones like oestrogen and insulin – both at the root of this cancer.

Dr Adeola Olaitan, gynaecological oncologist at University College Hospital London, says: ‘Rates of this cancer are on the rise and it is linked to increasing obesity.’
