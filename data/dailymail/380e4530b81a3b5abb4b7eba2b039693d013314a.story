Sir Richard Broadbent said he was 'startled' at the content of lads' mags and that he would look at changes

The chairman of Tesco said Britain’s biggest supermarket chain will consider taking lads’ mags off its shelves, after revealing that reading one had left him ‘startled’. 

Sir Richard Broadbent said: ‘I bought one of these lads’ mags recently. I was startled at what I saw. 

‘But I think we should be thoughtful in our response.

'I don’t immediately know what the answer should be. But I am willing to look at changes.’

The chairman of the country’s largest retailer was responding to a female shareholder at its annual meeting at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London. 

She asked for the titles to be removed from stores because they were ‘offensive’ to women.

Sir Richard said he was willing to talk to interested parties.

Tesco – along with many other supermarkets – sells a range of semi-pornographic magazines aimed at young men such as Nuts, Zoo, FHM and Loaded.

Critics say they have become increasingly raunchy since the first of the genre, Loaded, went on sale in 1994 and regularly show pictures of topless young girls in suggestive poses.

The Lose the Lads’ Mags campaign, by 
pressure groups UK Feminista and Object, says displaying publications 
with covers featuring near-naked women in stores, or requiring staff to 
handle them, could amount to sex discrimination or sexual harassment. 

They are considering a test case.

Object’s Sophie Bennett said campaigners welcomed Sir Richard’s remarks.

She said: ‘It’s crucial now that he listens to Tesco’s shareholders and the thousands of people who have contacted Tesco asking them to lose the lads’ mags.’

Dr Peter Hegarty, of the University of Surrey, said: ‘There is a fundamental concern that the content of such magazines normalises the treatment of women as sexual objects.’
