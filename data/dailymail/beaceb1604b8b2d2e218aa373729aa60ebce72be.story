Pensioners in their 60s and 70s have seen their incomes rise steadily during the recession years - and now they are less likely to be poor than any other group in society, according to a new report.

By contrast young people in their 20s have suffered a major drop in their living standards since the onset of the downturn, and middle-earners among twentysomethings have lost the most, with a 12 per cent income fall.

The analysis from the Institute for 
Fiscal Studies comes in a week which has seen rising controversy over 
the wealth and lifestyles of older people.

All smiles: Older people are now less likely to be poor than any other group, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies

A senior Church of England cleric, Bishop of London the Right Reverend Richard Chartres, said the ‘fortunate generation’ in their 60s are soaking up too much taxpayers’ money and that state spending on older people ‘raises questions of intergenerational equity’.

The bishop’s critics accuse him of ignoring the way the older generation have worked and saved for their lifestyles and of trying to create a divide between old and young.

The IFS report said: ‘Differences between age groups are not new but reflect longer term trends.

‘Pensioners have consistently seen faster income growth than other family types and age groups over the past 30 years.’

Reasons for higher incomes among older people over the past three decades have included the spread of good occupational pensions during the 1960s, 70s and 80s, and the introduction of more generous means-tested benefits for low-income pensioners by the Labour government after 1997.

Larger numbers of older people are also staying in jobs rather than taking retirement. Official figures this week showed that more than a million over-65s are now working, double the numbers of 20 years ago.

‘Individuals aged 60 or above are the only age group not to see real falls in median income since the recession,’ the report said, adding that incomes for older people have grown by between two and three per cent between 2007 and 2012.

Since the late 1970s, it said, pensioner incomes have gone up at an average rate of about two per cent a year, double the rise enjoyed by working-age people.

Age gap: The Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis showed how the over-65s are better off now than have ever been, while most other age groups have lower incomes than in 2007-08 and 2001-02

Younger working people without children have seen incomes go up at only a third of the pace of the increasing wealth of older people.

IFS economist David Phillips said: ‘This is in many ways a triumph of social policy.

‘But these figures also confirm that it is young people who have suffered most as a result of the recent recession and who are now at risk of falling further behind.

‘It is important that policymakers and politicians understand these profound changes to patterns of low incomes and respond accordingly.’

For people in their 20s, there was no real rise in incomes between 2001 and 2008, and a sharp drop during the recession years, the report said.

It said young adults with jobs and no children lost out in the 80s and 90s as incomes rose for the best paid, and that from the late 1990s onwards ‘earnings growth was generally weak for this group right across the income distribution.’

Some politicians, including Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, have suggested that depressed wages for less skilled young people were at least in part a result of large-scale immigration that meant millions of newcomers to the country were competing for jobs.

The IFS report, funded by the left-leaning research group the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, came on the day that official poverty figures showed that average incomes fell again last year.

Income: This graph shows how from 1978 to 2008 almost every group saw their incomes increase, but only the over-60s have seen their earnings rise from 2007 to 2012

A three per cent fall in average income in the year to last March - to £427 a week before housing costs are paid - was roughly the same drop as in the previous year.

As a result real average incomes are at roughly the same level as 10 years ago.

The across-the-board fall in earnings meant that poverty levels stayed the same when measured as ‘relative poverty’, the number of people living on incomes below 60 per cent of the average.

But 900,000 people, including 300,000 children, fell below the 60 per cent line from the previous year after incomes are adjusted for inflation. This measure is known as ‘absolute poverty’.

The Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘This was due to incomes not increasing as fast as inflation which was very high and is now coming down.’

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the previous Labour government had been ‘fixated’ by poverty lines and ‘despite paying out £170 billion in tax credits alone, they failed to meet their target to halve child poverty by 2010 and far too many children were left behind.’

He added that welfare reforms would cut real poverty by giving people incentives to get off benefits and take jobs.

But Labour Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Liam Byrne said: ‘The devastating verdict is in - in just one year this Government has pushed a million people into absolute poverty and progress in tackling relative child poverty has completely stalled.

‘What these figures show is living standards are collapsing to their lowest level in a decade, and that is forcing an extra 300,000 children to grow up in absolute poverty.’
