Carefully stacked on a quayside, this is the huge cocaine haul that has landed one of Britain’s most notorious criminals with a jail sentence of  28 years.

Bags of the drug were pulled from the sea after the yacht delivering the £150million  haul to this country capsized in a storm.

The man behind the failed smuggling operation was John Allen Brooks, 61, nicknamed ‘the Fixer’. Yesterday his lawyers said he has a heart condition and may die behind bars.

Piled high: Bags of cocaine are unloaded from a yacht off the west coast of Ireland, in the harbour at Castletown Bere

Haul: The massive stash of 1.5 tonnes of cocaine that was found on Brooks' boat Dances With Waves 

Custody: Brooks was arrested in 2008 after his boat, 
Dances With Waves, pictured, which was carrying the drugs haul, was intercepted by 
Irish authorities 170 miles (274km) off the south west coast of Ireland

Prison:
 John Alan Brooks, 61 was jailed for 28 years after being found guilty 
of masterminding a plot to smuggle £134million of cocaine into Britain

Brooks, who has a long history of 
involvement in drug crime  and was one of the first British criminals to
 flee to the Costa del Sol, tried to smuggle 1.5 tons  of cocaine across
 the Atlantic  in 2008.

Officers
 from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) tracked the yacht – 
Dances With Waves – as it made its way from Venezuela towards the Welsh 
coast.

They believed that once ashore the cocaine would be distributed from Liverpool. However, the Royal Navy stopped the yacht 170 miles off Ireland after it capsized during a gale-force storm which sent dozens of bags overboard.

Brooks, who was not on the yacht, was found guilty of conspiracy to import a class-A  drug and was yesterday jailed for 28 years at Birmingham Crown Court. Recorder Pal Sanghera told him he was a ‘centre point’ for all drug trafficking into this country.

‘You conspired to bring a horrifyingly large amount of cocaine, worth between £140million and £150million on the streets, into the country for no other reason than your own greed.

‘While you were not on the boat, your role was far greater, therefore your crime falls way outside the sentencing guidelines.’

Brooks, who was living in the Benahavis area on the Costa del Sol, was arrested on November 5 last year as he travelled to his native Blackpool to visit relatives.

The court heard nautical charts on board the 24ft yacht revealed a route from Venezuela to Caernarvon Bay.

Richard
 Davis, prosecuting, said all those on the yacht were sentenced to ten 
years in jail in Ireland after it was brought into Castletownbere, 
County Cork.

Paul Humphries,
 defending, said of his client: ‘He is 61 and has a heart condition, he 
is conscious of the fact that when he gets out, if he is still alive, he
 will have severe restrictions placed on him.’ In 2000 Brooks escaped a 
Moroccan jail by using a jet-ski to speed across the Strait of 
Gibraltar.

In 1987, he was 
one of six Britons arrested over a £1million drugs haul in Puerto Banus 
on the Costa del Sol. He was jailed for five years in Spain.

After
 yesterday’s hearing, a Soca  spokesman said: ‘Brooks is an 
international fixer for drug traffickers. He is an important target for 
us.’

Living room: Brooks had a history of arrests for drugs including a seizure of 4.2 tonnes of cannabis

 each jailed for ten years at Cork Circuit Criminal Court in May 2009
