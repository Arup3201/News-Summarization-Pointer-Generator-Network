Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani is set to reject advances from Manchester United after the club's failure to qualify for next season's Champions League, according to reports.

The 27-year-old has been linked with a move to Old Trafford, but French publication L'Equipe states United's absence in Europe means the forward would prefer to stay in Paris.

The paper also claims that Cavani was 
unhappy with his position in the PSG team, but following talks with the 
club, he has decided to remain at the Parc des Princes.

All smiles: Edinson Cavani joined PSG for £55million on a five-year-deal from Napoli in July 2013

The Uruguay forward netted 22 goals in 39 appearances to help the club achieve a league and cup double - despite often playing out wide to allow talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic the lone role up front.

Cavani joined the Parisian outfit on a five-year-deal for £55million from Italian outfit Napoli in July 2013.

Prior to the move, the striker scored 78 goals in three seasons in Naples to make him one of the world's the most coveted forwards.

The capture of Cavani would have bolstered United's striking department which already boasts Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Javier Hernandez and Danny Welbeck.

He will have the chance to put himself in the shop window during the World Cup and Premier League clubs will have an especially keen eye on him when he faces England on June 19.

Strength in depth: United already can boast the firepower of Dutchman Robin van Persie in their squad
