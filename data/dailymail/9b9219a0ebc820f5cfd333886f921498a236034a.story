False prescription: Mahfooz Ulhaq doctored his prescription in an attempt to het hold of Viagra on the NHS

A conman tried to get Viagra on the 
NHS by altering his prescription - but he was caught out when 
pharmacists spotted he had spelled the drug's name wrong.

Mahfooz
Ulhaq, 45, scribbled over his doctor's handwriting in an attempt to get
hold of the erectile dysfunction drug in Nottingham city centre.

But
two pharmacists who were handed the prescriptions contacted the 
defendant's GP surgery and discovered that he was not supposed to 
receive it.

Ulhaq - who stood up in the dock with the aid of a crutch - admitted two charges of making false prescriptions with the intention of gaining pharmaceutical drugs at Nottingham Magistrates' Court.

He was sentenced to a suspended jail term.

Chair of magistrates Patricia Boyce-Forgenie told him: 'It is very serious. You are on a lot of medication and do not know how Viagra would have interacted with the other medication.

'It was very risky thing to do.'

Neil Hollett, prosecuting, said Ulhaq tried to obtain the drugs from the Nottingham City Hospital’s outpatients’ pharmacy and from a nearby Boots pharmacy.

'On the first occasion a member of staff brought to the attention of the pharmacist that the defendant was back to collect some medication he already had,' he said.

'They could see the doctor’s handwriting had been overwritten and other medication added on the prescription.

'It also contained spelling errors. It was shown to the doctor who had prescribed it and found to be fraudulently altered.'

Mr Hollett said that another member of
staff said Ulhaq had requested his medication to be dispensed in 
disguised bottles as 'he didn’t want his family knowing what he was 
diagnosed with'.

On the second occasion, Ulhaq dropped off a prescription and said he would collect it the following day.

Mr
Hollett added: 'When a member of staff came to dispense it, they found 
something not quite right. It said 100ml when it was meant to be 100mg.

Pharmacy con: Ulhaq tried to get hold of the drug at Nottingham City Hospital when he went to the outpatients' pharmacy. However, pharmacists spotted errors with his prescription and he was denied the drug

'They believed it had been altered.'

The court heard Ulhaq, from Aspley, Nottinghamshire, went in the next day and was refused his prescription and the prescribing doctor confirmed it had been altered.

Ulhaq was arrested and told police he had written on both prescriptions but claimed he had no intention of getting the Viagra.

He said he had lost another prescription and had written on those ones to remember what had been on it.

Defending Chris Brewin said: 'Daily life for Mr Ulhaq is extremely difficult. He has spinal problems which affect his mobility.

'He was prescribed Viagra but what happened was the separate prescription became soiled, and the solution was to add Viagra to another prescription.

'He knows this was wrong. He is very disappointed to find himself back before the court.'

Ulhaq was sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for a year. He was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £80 victim surcharge.
