Homeless thief Nathan Dorsett, 30, stole from Oxford University colleges because it was 'better than burgling people's homes'

A serial thief who carried out a string of burglaries at Oxford University colleges because it was 'better than burgling people's homes' has been jailed.

Nathan Dorsett broke into the historic colleges to steal students' wallets, electrical items and even food from canteens and a buffet.

The 30-year-old homeless man was caught when he was found on campus with a crowbar and bolt croppers in his bag.

He was recognised from a wanted poster police had put up around the university and detained by staff at Mansfield College until police arrived to arrest him.

A judge heard that Dorsett had stolen a range of personal items from Oxford colleges during a series of break-ins in July and August this year.

He climbed over a fence into St John's College - previously attended by alumni including Tony Blair - stealing a handbag, wallet and a mobile phone from a room.

The next day he entered St Catherine's College, where he went into the canteen and ate food, before climbing through a window in Balliol College to steal a ring and cameras.

When inside St Catherine's, Dorsett headed for a buffet, eating and drinking refreshments which were laid out for a conference.

He also stole electrical items from St Anthony's College, in Woodstock Road, on August 25.

Dorsett admitted four counts of burglary, one count of theft and one count of being equipped to steal. 

He was sentenced  at Oxford Crown Court on Tuesday afternoon to two years and four months in jail.

Dorsett had previously been given a 23-week suspended sentence for handling stolen goods at Birmingham and Solihull Magistrates' Court on August 20, which will run consecutively with his new sentence.

Five other burglary offences at colleges - two committed in Oxford, two in York and one in Norfolk - were taken into consideration.

PC Jennifer Hanks, from Thames Valley Police, said: 'Dorsett had not only been targeting Oxford but had travelled around the country by train and had committed burglaries in other university towns and cities as he did not feel this was as bad as breaking into peoples' homes. However, during these incidents he stole personal belongings and stole from educational organisations.

'This custodial sentence means he will no longer be able to commit similar offences.'
