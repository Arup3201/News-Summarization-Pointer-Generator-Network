Decorated: Alexis Boyd, 23, was a U.S. Navy master-at-arms. She was eight months pregnant when she was killed

The only twin baby who survived after his pregnant mother was shot dead is expected to make it after recovering at a Florida hospital.

The baby was delivered after Alexis Boyce, 23, was allegedly shot in the head by her husband and the child's father Michael Boyce on Thursday.

Mrs Boyce was eight pregnant with twin boys. Doctors in Orlando, Florida, were only able to save one of the unborn babies. 

His grandfather revealed that the child's name is Jael Huntley, a name Mrs Boyce picked out before her death.

Leon Huntley told WFTV that little Jael is in stable condition and it getting the best care available.

'We're still praying for the child to get stronger and stronger and we know it's in the hands of the Lord right now,' he said.

'They're doing all that they can do, as far as technology and medical science, that the child is getting the best care.'

Mr Huntley said he has been overwhelmed by the support he has received from the community.

Boyce has been charged with shooting his wife Alexis - a Master at Arms in the U.S. Navy after a fight in their Orlando home.

Mr Huntley, who was in the next room, said he confronted Boyce when he still had the gun he had just used to killed his daughter in his hand.

'I had no fear. I demanded that he put the weapon down. Something got through to him and he put the weapon down,' he said. 

Mrs Boyce was rushed to Orlando Regional Medical Center but was pronounced dead on arrival, along with one of her unborn sons.

The other boy was listed in critical condition on Thursday night at the neonatal intensive care unit at Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies.

Boyce initially told authorities that his wife had shot herself in the head, but when he was presented with further evidence, he switched his story.

Boyce then claimed he had accidentally shot her, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

He was arrested on first-degree murder charges and taken to the Orange County Jail.

He has so far been charged with the murder of his wife but authorities said further charges regarding the death of his unborn son could also be brought, WFTV reported.

The news station was outside the Orange County Sheriff's Office as Boyce, dressed in a white jump suit, was taken to a patrol car that took him to the Orange County Jail early on Friday morning.

He was led away in handcuffs, kept his head down and refused to answer reporters' questions.

He is expected to make his first appearance in front of a judge Friday afternoon.

The couple, who police said apparently did not have a history of domestic violence, had been married for about a year. Their Facebook pages suggest both have served in the U.S. Navy.
