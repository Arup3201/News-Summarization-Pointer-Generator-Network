From the Suffragettes and Marilyn Monroe to Rita Ora and Rihanna, red lipstick has been used by women for decades as a means of attracting attention.

And now it has been revealed that wearing rouge really does makes women feel more confident.

In psychological terms, red is associated with warmth, positive energy, and motivation, with studies finding that red is the colour which excites our emotions, as well as triggering feelings strength and ambition.

Red hot: It has been proven that red lipstick does make women feel more confident and sexy so it comes as no surprise that Rihanna designed her own version for MAC and Rita Ora wears it every single day

Not only is it a huge confidence booster, but studies confirm that red lipstick is officially the sexiest colour.

Scientists at the University of Manchester found that red lipstick draws attention to the mouth, most notably from the opposite sex.

In their study, they tracked the eye movements of 50 men who were viewing different images of women and found that men spent longer fixating on the women wearing red lipstick.

They found that they spent 7.3 seconds staring at red lips, 6.7 seconds on those with pink lips, and 2.2 seconds on those who wore no lipstick.

Attractive: A study even found that men stare for longer at women with red lips and tipped waitresses wearing the colour more

A French study found that waitresses who wore red lipstick on the job received tips 50 per cent of the time from male customers, while those wearing brown, pink or no lipstick were tipped 30 per cent of the time.

The study asked men why they tipped those specific waitresses more and they acknowledged that it was because they found them more attractive.

Anna DeVere, formerly of Elizabeth Arden, now at Colour Me Beautiful, told the Huffington Post: 'During World War II, Elizabeth Arden created a red lipstick for American women serving in the US armed forces to help them feel confident and powerful.'

Standing the test of time: Suffragette Christabel Pankhurst wore red to empower herself, whilst Marilyn Monroe was rarely seen without a slick of rouge to get attention

And it seems that modern-day celebrities have been quick to notice the positive effects of a spot of rouge.

Speaking in this month's edition of Glamour, Rita Ora said:  Wearing red lipstick, in my opinion, is the simplest way to make an impact,

'As soon as I slick it on, I feel instantly pulled together, more powerful, more womanly. I wear it almost every day.'

Gwyneth Paltrow famously said in an interview: 'Beauty, to me, is about being comfortable in your own skin. That, or a kick-ass red lipstick!'

Celebrity make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury loves a red lip, she said: 'As the incredible Elizabeth Taylor said, “Pour yourself a drink, put on some lipstick, and pull yourself together.”  A slick of red lipstick instantly makes you feel sexier, empowered and like you can take on the world.’

Rihanna also loves a red lip and has even designed her own limited edition version for MAC cosmetics, Ruby Woo, which sold out in three hours of going on sale.
