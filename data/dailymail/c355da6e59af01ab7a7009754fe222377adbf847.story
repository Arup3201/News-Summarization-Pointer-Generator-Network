Fifty ‘irreplaceable’ medals awarded to one family of Gurkhas over five generations and after 127 years of service to the British Army have been stolen.

Members of the Gurung family have fought and died for Britain since 1886, but now they have been robbed of that legacy after thieves broke into the family's Nepalese restaurant in Nuneaton, Warwickshire.

Om Gurung, his father Bil bahadur, his grandfather Shirprasad and his great-grandfather Suklal, who received the George Medal posthumously, amassed the impressive collection of medals for service in conflicts including both world wars and fighting in Burma and Malaysia.

Om, 55, a former Regimental Sergeant Major with the Gurkha Signals, was left devastated after the theft from a cabinet displaying the medals in his restaurant Crossed Khukris, late last Sunday night.

Om received an MBE from the Queen in 1997 for his services as the last Gurkha regimental sergeant major during the handover of Hong Kong.

He said: ‘They had been put away in a locker, which was forced open by the burglars.

‘It's very upsetting, because the medals have such sentimental value and cannot be replaced.

‘My family have served the British 
for 127 years and to think these medals have been stolen is terrible. I 
am not bothered about the money, it is the history and value of these 
medals that matters.

‘There
were about 50 medals in all, dating back to the First World War. I 
occasionally had them on show in frames on the wall of my restaurant and
it is possible that someone broke in specifically to get them.

‘Whoever is responsible forced their way through a rear door and made a thorough search.

‘As
well as the medals, they also emptied four charity boxes, containing 
about £250, the till, which had £50 in it, and even took money from a 
staff tip box.’

The theft 
happened around 11.30pm last Sunday night, when the restaurant closed, 
and it was not until noon the following day that the break-in was 
discovered.

Om, who settled in Nuneaton after 
serving at the town's Bramcote Barracks and retiring from the army, has 
continued his involvement with the military.

He
founded the British Gurkha Veterans Association, was president of 
Nuneaton Rotary Club and has been a constant supporter of ex-service, 
civic and local charities.

On
Tuesday, Om helped to organise a special ceremony at the Co-op Club in 
Nuneaton when medals were handed to 126 former Gurkha soldiers who had 
served in Malaysia.

In 
attendance was Nuneaton and Bedworth deputy mayor Bob Copland who said: 
‘I was very shocked to hear about Om's burglary, which he purposely kept
to himself on Tuesday so that it wouldn't overshadow the presentation 
proceedings.

‘That is typical of the man, who is such a lovely person and a real star.

'It's the history that matters': Still an active member of the army community, Om said the medals, which were stolen from a cabinet in the family restaurant, had sentimental value

‘I cannot find the words to describe what I feel about the sort of people who would steal a soldier's medals and money donated for charity.’

A spokesman for Warwickshire Police said: ‘We would ask anyone who saw anything, has any information or anyone who has been offered any medals to contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.’

Gurkhas are Nepalese fighters who fight for British and Indian military units. More than 200,000 fought in the two world wars, and they have served in Kosovo, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Borneo, Cyprus, the Falklands, and now in Iraq and Afghanistan over the last 50 years.
