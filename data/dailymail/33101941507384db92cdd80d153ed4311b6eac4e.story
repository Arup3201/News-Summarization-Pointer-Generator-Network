As a younger dog, Bennie once saved his family from a house fire, but once he got older his family couldn't keep him.

The graying 10-year-old chocolate lab was given up by his owners because they had a child who Bennie was not getting along with. 

Tarah Motuzas, who runs Toronto-based animal rescue Canine Haven, said on Wednesday that Bennie was currently in the process of an adoption.

'He was surrendered to a boarding facility in Toronto,' said Motuzas. 'Luckily my sister works there and she reached out to me since I run Canine Haven.'

She posted Bennie's story to Facebook and received a strong response from people eager to adopt him, with one dog lover asking if it was possible to arrange an adoption to Sweden. 

Motuzas said that Bennie was a regular at the facility where he was surrendered.

Playful: A Facebook post for Bennie says he is best with older, quieter dogs and does not like children or cats, and he's already attracted some interest in adopting him

'I think surrendering him to a place where he knows people and is comfortable was the best they could've done for him,' said Motuzas. 'Its better than a shelter.'

'These are our companions, we are suppose to look after them, care for them and keep them out of harms way,' she added. 'If you're not willing to do that, get a fish.'
