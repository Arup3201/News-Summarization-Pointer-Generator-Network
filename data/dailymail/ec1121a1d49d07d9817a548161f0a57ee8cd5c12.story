As authorities attempt to contain home-grown terrorists and stop them from leaving the country, it seems some  have still managed to slip through the cracks.

Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan told a parliamentary committee on Thursday that a group of people managed to leave the country this week, but were 'not on anyone's radar', the Guardian reported.

'We got wind of it after the fact, but the fact is there are still people travelling,' said Gaughan - the national manager of counter-terrorism for the Australian Federal Police.

More Australians have slipped through the cracks and fled overseas to join the fight with Islamic State

This comes just days ahead of the G20 summit to be held in Brisbane, which will be attended by a large number of world leaders. 

According to The Daily Telegraph, counter terrorism officers have been deployed to all Australian international airports.

Gaughan also told the committee he believed that federal police officers needed greater controls urgently, so they were better able to track the movements and interactions of suspects. 

Authorities argue they need more tools to monitor suspects and prevent them from being radicalised

'But the fact is there’s still people travelling and regardless of what we’re doing, we’re not stopping that so we need some other tools,' he said, according to The Telegraph.

Thought he did not reveal from where or to what destination the group travelled, Gaughan said officers are now virtually powerless to stop them unless they resurface elsewhere.

'Unfortunately, once they get into Syria or into Iraq, there is nothing the AFP can do except wait for them to basically pop their head up somewhere on the way back.'

Gaughan was speaking at an investigation into new legislation which aims to give security agencies power to issue control orders on people who are enabling or supporting terrorism.

He also revealed that authorities were struggling to keep up with the sheer number of people being radicalised in such a short time - often less than six months.

Authorities said the ability to put restrictions on who suspects can communicate with and where they can go would allow them to greatly reduce the change of an attack on home soil.
