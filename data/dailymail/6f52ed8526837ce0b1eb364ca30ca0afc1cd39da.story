A Tube driver has appeared in court charged with unlawfully endangering passengers after he ‘drove a train while intoxicated’.

Ian Comfort, 50, from Thamesmead, southeast London, is accused of driving a Jubilee line train while unfit through drink and drugs on March 22.

He faces two charges – one of 'working on the railway whilst unfit to carry out that work through drink or drugs' and a second charge of committing an 'unlawful act, driving a train, while unfit through drink or drugs while endangering the safety of someone being conveyed in or on that railway'.
