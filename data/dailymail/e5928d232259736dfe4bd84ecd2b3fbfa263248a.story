When villagers searching for a missing cat heard frantic miaowing from a recycling bin, they thought the runaway had been found.

But their efforts to free the cat, which was due to give birth any moment, became increasingly desperate as the lock on the clothing bin was broken and couldn’t be opened.

After the fire brigade and RSPCA’s attempts also failed, the worried villagers had it loaded on to a truck and driven to a specialist engineering firm 20 miles away.

Miaow!: Rescuers spent 12 hours trying to get this squeaky toy cat out of a clothes bank, thinking it was a real cat

There, steel saws were used to gain access and the mewing prisoner was revealed – as nothing more than a squeaky toy.

Kelvin Owen, who owns the engineering 
firm, said: ‘Once we got into the bin we heard the miaowing – it sounded
 just like a cat and we all started to carefully search the bags.

‘Then I found a bag of toys and picked
 out a toy. I said: “It couldn’t be this, could it?” As I held it it 
went “miaow, miaow”. Mystery solved!’

The 12-hour drama unfolded in the 
seaside village of Moelfre, near Anglesey, North Wales, as a pregnant 
stray cat was being taken to a foster home by an animal charity worker.

As the animal was being dropped off 
she escaped. Villagers were alerted to be on the lookout for the cat but
 it wasn’t until three days later that miaowing was heard from the 
clothes bin.

Missing: Puss Puss, the pregnant cat rescuers thought was stuck in the recycling bin

‘By this time we thought the cat had been in there for three days,’ said Jasmine Hazlehurst, from animal charity Anglesey Pets.

‘We were worried she could have had 
the kittens and was trapped, without much air supply or food, so we were
 desperate to get her out. I did feel embarrassed when they pulled out 
the stuffed cat.

‘People were laughing, it was a 
priceless moment. I’m not that familiar with Disney toys but I’m told it
 is Marie from the Aristocats. She makes a miaowing sound that is very 
realistic when you touch her paw. My five-year-old daughter Naomi has 
been playing with her ever since.’

The pregnant cat is still missing. 
‘Cats have a way of getting into people’s homes and hearts, so we are 
just hoping someone is feeding and looking after her,’ said Mrs 
Hazlehurst.
