Tottenham have struck a deal with Swansea to sign Ben Davies and Michel Vorm with Gylfi Sigurdsson and cash going the other way.

The £15million arrangement sees Tottenham pip Liverpool to both targets.

Davies, a 21-year-old Wales international, has moved to White Hart Lane despite Liverpool's overtures because he believes he will play more regularly.

Holland international Vorm has also been watched closely by Liverpool as they wanted competition for Simon Mignolet.

Prospect: Davies has attracted the attention of several top clubs including Liverpool, but is set for Spurs

Promising: Davies impressed at full back for Swansea in the Premier League last season

Solid: Vorm has been a consistent performer in the Premier League over the last few years

New chapter: Sigurdsson is set to depart Tottenham after two years

However, their inability to move Pepe Reina to Napoli on a permanent deal slowed down their pursuit. The 30-year-old Vorm will provide competition for Hugo Lloris who recently signed a new five year contract.

Liverpool have interest in Sevilla's Alberto Moreno which is threatened by Atletico Madrid. He is also considered over-priced and it could prompt a renewed bid for Chelsea's Ryan Bertrand.

They have offered the buyout clause of £8.5million for Loic Remy at QPR, but he may have to drop his wage demands for the deal to be concluded.

Sigurdsson, meanwhile, returns to Swansea, the club where he forged a reputation a goalscoring midfielder. Crystal Palace had agreed an £8million fee with Tottenham for the Iceland international but the player preferred a switch back to Wales.
