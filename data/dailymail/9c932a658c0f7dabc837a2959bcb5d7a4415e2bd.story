Admission: Lord Razzall with his partner, Baroness Bonham-Carter

A senior Liberal Democrat has revealed that he was approached dozens of times by wealthy supporters who offered £1million or more to buy seats in the House of Lords.

In remarks that threaten a new cash for honours controversy, the party’s former treasurer Lord Razzall admitted yesterday he told business people who made such approaches ‘several times a year’ to ‘keep quiet’.

The peer said he had advised would-be donors it would be against the law to sell an honour, but conceded there would be quasi-corruption in the political system until party funding is reformed.

‘In politics a lot of people particularly give big money because they want something,’ said Lord Razzall, who was in charge of Lib Dem finances for 12 years.

‘They either want to influence the party’s policies, or they want access to the leader, or in a lot of cases they want some sort of honour, which of course is a criminal offence.

‘Unless you restrict the amount of money that can come into the political process, you will always have quasi-corruption.’

Asked if he had been made ‘dishonourable’ offers, the peer told BBC Radio 5 Live: ‘Oh God, yes.

‘Anybody who has been a party treasurer of any of the three parties will tell you, if they are honest, that there are numerous people who came to you and said, “I will give you a million pounds as long as I can go into the House of Lords”.

‘There’s nobody to who that has not happened, and everybody knows what you have to say, which is, “I’m terribly sorry, that’s a criminal offence. Would you mind keeping quiet?”.’

Asked how often wealthy individuals attempted to buy honours over his 12 years as treasurer, Lord Razzall replied: ‘I should think several times a year.

‘If you were to ask the treasurer of the Tory party or the treasurer of the Labour party, and get them to be honest, they would say exactly the same.’ 

Under the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925, it is a criminal offence to offer ‘any gift, money or valuable consideration as an inducement or reward for procuring or assisting or endeavouring to procure the grant of a dignity or title of honour’.

But asked why he failed to report offers of cash for honours to police, Lord Razzall said: ‘I don’t think it’s an offence, no.

‘The offence would be to procure an honour for somebody in return for a payment.

‘All I can say is that a lot of treasurers would have to spend a lot of time at the police station if we had to report anyone who said that to us.’

Earlier this year former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott – who quit the party after being exposed as being involved in a plot to oust its leader Nick Clegg – also raised questions about donors.

He complained that his efforts to ‘expose and end cash for peerages in all parties, including our own’, had failed.

Ken Ritchie, former chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: ‘This is further evidence that the Lords is a totally undemocratic body and the sooner we make it elected or scrap it altogether the better.’

Non-domiciled peers who do not pay tax in the UK were banned from peerages in 2010 under Labour, with cross-party support.

But Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg’s plans to slash the number of peers from more than 800 to 450, with 80 per cent elected, was dropped after 91 Tory MPs rebelled and Labour refused to back the move.

The original cash for honours scandal saw several businessmen who loaned money to Labour – which unlike a donation did not have to be declared – nominated for life peerages.

A police investigation saw then prime minister Tony Blair questioned by detectives and Labour forced to repay the loans, although no charges were brought.

The Lib Dems have been heavily dependent on millionaire backers who have been made peers. Of all cash donations to the party in 2012, more than £600,000 – or 40 per cent – came from wealthy supporters who were subsequently appointed to the House of Lords by Mr Clegg.

They include Ministry of Sound owner James Palumbo – now Lord Palumbo of Southwark – who has donated more than £500,000 to the party.

And Domino’s pizza tycoon Rumi Verjee was made Lord Verjee of Portobello after handing over £770,000, some via his company Brompton Capital Ltd.

There is no suggestion that any of the peers has done anything wrong.

Party leader Mr Clegg has said businessmen are ‘perfectly’ entitled to give the Lib Dems large sums and it is unfair to suggest they should not separately be nominated for peerages.

A party spokesman said: ‘The Liberal Democrats have robust procedures in regards to handling donations that comply with all legal requirements.

‘All staff involved in the process are aware of the rules and regulations surrounding donations and these are always made clear to the donor at the outset.’
