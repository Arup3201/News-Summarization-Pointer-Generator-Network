Attention ladies and gentlemen! For his next feat, Nik Wallenda will cross the city of Chicago on a tightrope 50 stories in the air.

The daredevil performer revealed his latest plan in an interview with Outside, and it is not for the faint of heart.

He said he will begin at the Marina City West tower and walk a wire strung at an uphill 15-degree angle across the Chicago River to the Leo Burnett Building.

Latest feat: Nik Wallenda (above walking the Grand Canyon) has announced he will cross the Chicago River 50 stories in the air this November for a live-TV special

Up in the air: Wallenda will walk from the Marina City West tower (far right) to the Leo Burnett Building (far left), then return to the West tower and walk to the Marina City East tower (second from right)

And's that's not all. 

Then he'll come down to ground level, walk back to Marina City West, and cross another wire to the Marina City East tower.

It is all set to go down on November 2, and, of course, will air as a live-TV special on Discovery.

This setting is shockingly urban for the tightrope walker, whose last two nerve-racking feats involved him crossing the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls.

The city also presents challenges that seem to make Wallenda a bit nervous.

'It’s gonna be cold. It’s gonna be windy,' he said. 

'That’s the challenge. The other walks were enjoyable, peaceful.'

Seeing as those previous two 'peaceful' walks took place 1,400 feet in the air, it is safe to say the performer has a far different definition of the word than most.

Wallenda will be untethered for the walk, which he prefers.

He was tethered for the Niagara Falls walk, but was not for his performance in the Grand Canyon, meaning that any slip would be fatal.

Seven members of his family have fallen to their death, most recently Nik’s great-grandfather Karl during a 1978 walk in Puerto Rico.

That fear of possible death is what brings in the audiences however, says Wallenda.

'The public is fascinated with a guy on TV that could die at any second.'

He quickly added, 'Now, do they wanna see me die? I don’t think so.'
