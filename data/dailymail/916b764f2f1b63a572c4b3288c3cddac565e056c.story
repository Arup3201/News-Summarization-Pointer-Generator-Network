A congressman caught with cocaine in an undercover police sting refused to resign his Florida seat after leaving rehab.

Republican Trey Radel said he wants to 'rebuild the trust' of voters during a news conference held the same day he left a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center.

The 37-year-old freshman told reporters at his Cape Coral office that he will cooperate with congressional investigators who are looking into his conduct.

Vow: Congressman Trey Radel tells the press he wants to rebuild trust after his enforced stint in rehab following his conviction for cocaine possession

'I love what I do and I’m going to return to what I do, what you sent me to do in Washington D.C., which is working for you and your family while I relish mine,' Radel told voters watching on live television in his district.

'No one — no one will take away my passion when it comes to serving southwest Florida.'

On November 20, Radel pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of cocaine possession and was sentenced to a year of probation.

He admitted to purchasing 3.5 grams of cocaine from an undercover officer in Washington on Oct. 29. He entered rehab on November 21.

Standing with his wife at the evening 
news conference, Radel pledged to redouble his congressional efforts 
'with a clearer focus and a stronger mind' and regain the trust of his 
constituents.

While he 
declined to say whether he would run for re-election, he gave what 
amounted to a campaign speech, vigorously defending his legislative 
record and repeatedly addressing TV viewers.

Radel, a former local news anchor, timed his announcement for the 6 p.m. newscasts.

'My
 situation isn’t the end, and it’s not the whole story,' he said, 
ticking off a list of priorities, including reducing the deficit and 
protecting Social Security and Medicare.

The House Ethics Committee announced Monday that it was launching a formal investigation of the congressman.

Several
 GOP leaders, including Gov. Rick Scott, had asked him to resign. On 
Thursday, some of those same officials reiterated their calls for Radel 
to step down.

In a statement, Scott said, 'I’m glad that Trey has sought help, and it’s my hope he continues to put his attention on rehabilitation and his family.'

Former Rep. Connie Mack IV, who 
represented the area for eight years before a failed run for Senate last
 year, has been mentioned as a possible primary challenger.

Radel
 said his drug and alcohol abuse never interfered with his official 
duties. 'This was my personal issue on personal time,' he said.

While
 court documents said the lawmaker purchased cocaine on several 
occasions prior to his bust in October, he maintained Thursday that he 
had only used the drug 'a handful of times' beginning in college. His 
treatment, he said, was focused on alcoholism.

Radel's wife Amy is 'my rock,' he said, and his two-year-old son Henry is 'my little guy' -- but Mrs. Radel was nowhere to be seen during the press conference

Asked about his support for drug testing food-stamp recipients, Radel said members of Congress 'can and should be tested as well.'

'Maybe it will help someone else in the future.'

Radel had been in office for 10 months when he was charged. His district includes the Gulf Coast cities of Fort Myers and Naples.

The drug arrest derailed a seemingly promising career.

After a stint as a TV news anchor, he started a media-relations firm and hosted an early-morning conservative talk-radio show in southwest Florida. He married another news anchor and they had a baby.

On Thursday, his wife, Amy, called him a 'great man' and said she supported his return to public life.

When he decided to run for Congress, he became involved in a bruising, six-way GOP primary, openly targeting opponents on the Internet and facing criticism for his firm’s ownership of explicitly named websites.

But he was backed by the local tea party movement and Republican luminaries, including Mack and Sen. Marco Rubio, and clinched the GOP nomination. He cruised to victory in November.

Things were seemingly going well for Radel. His wife was featured in a glowing local news segment about how the couple were adjusting to life in D.C., he had sponsored a handful of bills, and he was interviewed by several inside-the-Beltway publications.

He was active on Twitter and wrote pieces for Buzzfeed about rap music. (He dubbed Public Enemy’s 'Fight the Power' a conservative anthem 'because I believe when government expands it becomes a political tool meant to oppress.')

He championed cuts in sheep-farm subsidies, keeping good on his conservative promise.

Then, on Oct. 29, Radel attempted to buy $250 worth of cocaine from an undercover police officer in a Washington, D.C., neighborhood.

According to court documents, federal agents confronted the congressman and he invited them to his apartment, where he turned over a vial of the drug.

A DEA official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release details of the case in his own name said Radel was identified to authorities as a cocaine buyer by his suspected dealer.

For the next three weeks, Radel didn’t skip a beat. He held a re-election fundraiser at a Naples country club, continued to cast votes and bashed 'Obamacare' on Twitter. He did not tell House leaders about the bust until Nov. 19, when reporters broke the news about the case.

When his arrest became public, Radel said during a news conference that he had struggled with drug and alcohol abuse 'off and on for years.'

On Thursday, he said he would continue to build a support system 'for the rest of my life,' including attending daily meetings and 'reconnecting with my spiritual side.'

His first task, he said: setting up the family Christmas tree.
