The Queen shared a joke with Stephen Hawking at a charity event as they mingled at an event to honour one of the country's leading charities for the disabled.

The monarch and world-famous scientist were among the stars who gathered in St James's Palace at a reception paying tribute to the work of Leonard Cheshire Disability, which was founded by an RAF pilot in 1948.

When the two met, the Queen said: 'Have you still got that American voice? - to which Professor Hawking replied 'Yes, it is copyrighted actually'.

Been a while: Prince Philip also remarked how it had been some time since he had seen the famous scientist

The exchange was reported by Patricia O'Dowd, the physicist's nurse, who said: 'He has met the Queen and Prince before. Prince Philip said he hadn't seen him in ages.

They joined campaigner Esther Rantzen, broadcaster Fiona Phillips and former Olympic athlete Dame Mary Peters at the glitzy event, where the Queen, accompanied by Prince Philip, mingled with guests for around 45 minutes.

Wearing an aqua blue embroidered skirt and matching jacket and clutching a black patent leather handbag, the Queen spent around 45 minutes chatting to charity staff and supporters at the glitzy reception in St James' Palace. She has been the charity's patron since 1980.

Professor Hawking's sense of humour has been on good form this week, having yesterday unveiled a lighthearted formula which could bring England's footballers success in the World Cup.

The Cambridge physicists highlighted a list of factors, including altitude, formation and temperature inside the stadium, which could hold the secret to victory.

He also crunched the numbers behind the 'perfect penalty' after being commissioned by bookmakers Paddy Power.

The charity's boss Claire Pelham said she was overwhelmed by the interest the Queen showed in their work.

She said: 'It is a huge honour to meet the Queen. I was absolutely amazed at how long she spent with every person - she didn't just whizz past people.

'I know she has always closely followed what we do.

'I do think Leonard would be proud of what we are doing if he was alive today. He was a radical.

'When he started this charity disabled people were locked up in hospital out of sight and he was absolutely not OK with that.

'He had fought alongside people in the war who were now disabled people and he wasn't prepared to accept that they should be locked up in a hospital while he lived a full life.

'That was his vision, that is our vision and we are determined to get it.'

The organisation was founded by RAF 
pilot Leonard Cheshire in 1948 after he witnessed the  
Nagasaki nuclear attack. It helps disabled people around the world to
 get an education, start businesses and campaign for change.

Among the remarkable guests at the royal gala was Harris, a brown and white Cocker Spaniel used by the charity to provide some tactile companionship to disabled residents.

The dog-loving Queen, who famously owns a pack of corgis, stopped to pat the hound and spoke to his owner Claire Gorgulho, 30, a carer based at the charity's Edinburgh centre.

The Queen and Prince Philip both also chatted to Professor Stephen Hawking, and shared a joke with the Cambridge physicist.

The assembled guests then tucked into a three course meal amidst the finery of the lavish state rooms.
