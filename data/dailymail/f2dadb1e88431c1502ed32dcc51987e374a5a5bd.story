Roy Keane has urged Manchester United fans to give Louis van Gaal up to three years to prove himself at the Old Trafford helm.

The Dutch manager oversaw another disappointing performance and result in United's 2-1 FA Cup defeat by Arsenal at Old Trafford on Monday night.

Danny Welbeck returned to his old stomping ground to score the winner after Wayne Rooney levelled Nacho Monreal's strike in the first half, but it was yet another lacklustre display under Van Gaal that irked United supporters.

Their hero Keane, however, maintained the manager needs more time with fans unaware of what the job entails.

'Van Gaal is going to get criticised, you'd expect that,' Keane said during his BBC Match of the Day analysis.

'Give the man a chance - two or three years. A lot of fans don't quite understand how to run a football club as big as Manchester United.

'They should have given David Moyes more time but didn't. What are they going to do? Chop and change again? Van Gaal has been in the door two minutes. It takes time. It's literally a rebuilding job.

'It would be a disaster if United don't finish in top four. The big problem with people at the club and ex-players is they keep looking back comparing teams from 10 years ago. 

'They have got to look forward. Focus on the players, focus on the manager... get right behind him. I still think they have enough to get in that top four.'

Keane's old sparring partner, former Newcastle and England striker Alan Shearer, was more damning.

He said: 'Manchester United's main priority this season is finishing in the top four. If they don't then it will be a catastrophe.

'They have spent a lot of money on players. There's a hell of a lot more money that needs to be spent to get them anywhere near where they want to be. 

'There isn't another team in the Premier League that passes it back more than Manchester United.'

Keane and Shearer's battle of words during the BBC's FA Cup analysis were nothing compared to what the hot-headed duo got up to in their playing days.

Neither was a player the opposition wanted to get on the wrong side of, so no battle was more fierce than when the two clashed.

The former United captain named Shearer as a player he 'always had in the back of his mind' in his recent autobiography The Second Half alongside other famous foes like Patrick Vieira and Alf-Inge Haaland.

Keane made it clear that although he regularly came across Alan Shearer while working as a TV pundit, there is little or no chance of them ever building bridges such is the mutual dislike of each other.

The most famous flashpoint came in 2001 at St James' Park. The two skippers came head to head and Keane was shown a red card for lashing out at the England man.

It was the first time the former United maestro had appeared in the BBC studio after a long association with terrestrial rivals ITV.
