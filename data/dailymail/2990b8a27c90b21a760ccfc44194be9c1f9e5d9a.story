Pulling a stunt like this could get you labelled as loopy – but the man with jet-powered wings doing stunning aerial gymnastics with a plane knows exactly what he’s doing.

He’s ex Swiss fighter pilot Yves Rossy – aka Jetman – and a new video of him showing off his aerial skills has emerged.

Rossy was filmed 5,000 feet above the Dubai desert at speeds of up to 120mph in an incredible formation flight with aerobatics champion Veres Zoltán.

Stunning: A new video of Jetman has emerged, in which he flies in formation with aerobatics champion Veres Zoltán

Jetman became the first and only man in the history of aviation to fly with a jet-propelled wing in 2006

At one point the plane loops round him as he arrows forward, then the manoeuvre is reversed and he loops round the plane as it flies in a straight line.

Another Jetman appears at the end of the video dressed in a yellow outfit – but his or her identity remains a secret.

A spokesman for Jetman told MailOnline that the video is an appetiser for ‘something bigger and louder’ in 2015, and wouldn’t reveal any more than that.

According to his website, he became the first and only man in the history of aviation to fly with a jet-propelled wing in 2006.

Rossy was first a military pilot and then worked as a captain on commercial flights.

Daredevil: Jetman has been wowing the world for several years with his stunts. Pictured is another eye-popping moment from his latest video in Dubai

Mystery: At the end of the video someone in a yellow suit appears

His website said he 'has always dedicated all his free time to flight and experimented with all its forms', creating a harness with inflatable wing panels that he subsequently developed into a rigid wing with four engines.

He has completed flights over the Swiss Alps - including Lake Geneva in 2002 - and, in 2008, he crossed the English Channel in the flight path of Louis Blériot.

His invention has now been refined, so 'all he has is an altimeter for safety, and a tiny throttle control in his hand'.

He flew next to a 1940s' Breitling Douglas DC-3 over Lake Lucerne in Switzerland in 2012.

'Jetman' Rossy flew fighter jets for the Swiss air force for 17 years.

His custom built flight suit weighs almost 55kg and has a wing span of two metres.

He has also previously soared over the Grand Canyon for eight minutes.
