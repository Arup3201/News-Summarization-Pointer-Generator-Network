Â A New York City resident has sued the Food Network, saying its reality show 'Giving You the Business' wronged him by failing to award him as promised, a frozen yogurt franchise.

Kris Herrera says in a lawsuit filed on Tuesday in state court in Queens he was told in April along with three other contestants one of them would win a 16 Handles frozen yogurt franchise.

Herrera already worked for a store as a manager. The lawsuit says he won but instead was given a share of stock in the stores' parent company, Yogurt City Inc.

Franchise: Kris Herrera was told he would receive his own franchise of the frozen yoghurt store but has so far only received shares in the company, so he's suing the Food Network

Brand new show: 'Giving you the Business' has only run for one season so far and it appears to be failing to live up to its promises

He says since the show aired in May dozens of people have congratulated him each week.

Messages seeking comment from the Food Network and the parent company of the franchises on Wednesday haven't been returned.

The contestants on the show pits four employees at a fast-food chain against each other in a series of challenges.

Formally, the show breaks no new 
ground. Hidden cameras 'capture the mayhem' when these employees are 
confronted with a barrage of entitled whiners and lunatics played by 
actors.

Actors also portray 
hapless co-workers who require ungodly amounts of training. The company 
chief executive officer watches the footage in another room.

The Food Network says the franchises are worth as much as to $500,000 assuming they remain viable, successful businesses.
