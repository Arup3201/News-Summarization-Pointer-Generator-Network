One face is familiar.

The other?

Well, it could be anyone.

Buddy Holly? Elvis?

In fact, the gawky chap with the quiff and glasses alongside a youthful John Lennon is none other than Paul McCartney.

Friends John Lennon and Paul McCartney pose on the streets of Liverpool before fame and moptop hairstyles take hold, in a previously unpublished photograph

As they were better known, with bandmates George Harrison and Ringo Starr

Beatles in their Apple offices in Saville Row, London, for the launch of Sgt Pepper in June 1967 - just six years after the picture was taken

The year is 1961, on the cusp of Beatlemania, the year before they landed their record deal and scored their first chart hit with Love Me Do.

Lennon,
in leather jacket and polo neck is 21 and the man who would go on to be
his co-writer in some of the most famous songs in pop history is just 
18.

The previously 
unseen photo was taken outside a Liverpool outfitter’s shop at a time 
when the Beatles were playing gigs in pubs and clubs...and probably one 
of the last times they were able to walk the streets without being 
mobbed by screaming fans.

The picture is believed to have been taken by a fan shortly after Lennon’s school friend Stuart Sutcliffe left the band.

Author and Beatles expert Mark Lewisohn will publish the shot in a special edition of his new book The Beatles - All These Years: Volume One: Tune In later this year

Author
and Beatles expert Mark Lewisohn will publish the shot in a special 
edition of his new book The Beatles - All These Years: Volume One: Tune 
In later this year. 

Lewisohn,
who has written six previous books about the Fab Four, bought the 
picture from a fan in the band's home city of Liverpool two decades ago,
but it has never been printed.

‘This
photo captures the lull before the storm.’ he said.

‘I bought it about 
20 years ago from a Beatles fan in Liverpool. I didn’t get her name, it 
was just a transaction.’With their rockabilly quiffs, horn-rimmed 
glasses, and leather jackets, John Lennon and Paul McCartney look 
virtually unrecognisable as they pose on the streets of Liverpool.

Lennon and McCartney had been friends for around four years by the time the image was taken.

They grew even closer after Stuart Sutcliffe had left the line-up in December 1960, opting to stay on in Hamburg with girlfriend Astrid Kirchherr while the rest of the band returned to Merseyside. 

A little over two years later the group had topped the charts and were barely able to head out on the streets without being mobbed. 

Lewisohn's book is being published by Little, Brown on October 10, with the special edition coming out on November 14.
