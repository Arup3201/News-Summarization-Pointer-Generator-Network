Lauren Hill, the teenager with terminal cancer who realized her dream of playing college basketball, has joined other top athletes by having her picture printed on a box of Wheaties, the Breakfast of Champions.

The commemorative cereal box features an image of the Mount St Joseph freshman playing in Sunday's game, during which she scored the first points of the winning match.

'Lauren may have just hit the big time!' read a message on her Facebook support page on Wednesday, with a picture showing her holding the cereal box.  

Hill was diagnosed last year with an inoperable brain tumor and was told she had years to live.

Champion: Lauren Hill, 19, holds up her commemorative box of Wheaties, which shows a photograph of her playing in her first college game on Sunday. She has terminal cancer and has just weeks to live

Celebration: The box - which has the slogan 'the Breakfast of Champions' - shows her in the winning game

But in September, doctors had a grim update - she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout high school basketball player, Hill's hopes of playing college ball were put in jeopardy.

But the NCAA approved a waiver for Mount St Joseph to start its season two weeks earlier, and the team tipped off against Hiram College with Hill on the court.

NBC Sports reported that Mount St Joseph's had trouble with the practice drills for the first play they were planning for the game.

When they finally ran it for real, it all ran smoothly, with Hill finishing under the basket where sank a layup to put Mount St Joseph on the board. 

Powering through: The NCAA approved a waiver for Mount St Joseph to play its first game of the season against Hiram College two weeks earlier so that Hill, pictured, could play her first ever collegiate game

Basket: Hill sunk the layup for the first score of the game before heading to the bench, though she came in later

Hill is the last person trying to focus on her condition, though, saying to an interviewer, 'Let's not call it my last game. This is my first collegiate game.'  

She was awarded the USBWA Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award at halftime as Summitt, the coach with the most ever wins in NCAA basketball, stood by her.

'I never gave up for a second even when I got a terminal diagnosis; never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore,' Hill told Local 12 before the game.

Hill learned she would secure a chance to play on October 1 during a surprise birthday party, the school informed her they'd gotten the NCAA waiver.

'I love the roar of the crowd, the squeaking of the shoes. I can't wait to be on this court and wearing #22,' she said then. 

Family: Hill cheered on her team from the Mount St Joseph bench. She wore protection for her eyes and ears as her condition makes her extra sensitive to light and sound

Inspiration: Hill created the Layup4Lauren campaign to raise money towards a cure for DIPG, and coaches and fans have said that Hill has inspired them with her selflessness

Since her new prognosis, she's been trying to raise awareness for her terminal condition, Diffused Intrinsic Pentene Gleoma, starting a campaign called #Layup4Lauren.

In a layup challenge on the site, a person is asked to spin around and try a layup with their non-dominant hand to simulate the struggle of playing with a condition like the one Hill has. 

So far, teams like Mount St Joseph and Xavier and people like Garth Brooks and Nick Lachey have recorded their challenge videos.

'She's a special person,' Mount St Joseph coach, Dan Benjamin, said. 'This girl is so strong, she's dealing with death and all she's thinking about is everyone else.
