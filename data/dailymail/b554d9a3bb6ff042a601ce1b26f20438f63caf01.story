The sister of a man shot dead during a botched Gold Coast robbery has taken pitty on her brother's killer, security guard Wayne Heneker, saying he 'was just doing his job'.

Nasreen Rahman, the elder sister of Shameem Rahman, 46, who was killed on Monday while trying to rob a security from a firm he was laid off at, said it must be a distressing time for the 47-year-old guard who shot her brother three times.

In the days since Sharmeem Raheem's death, an outpouring of support has been directed towards Mr Heneker, including from the most unlikey of places, the dead man's family.

'I feel sorry for him:' Nasreen Rahman, The sister of slain robber, Shameem, said she does not begrudge the security guard who shot her brother in a botched armed hold-up

Police said Mr Heneker acted on instinct, and Ms Rahman agreed. She told the Courier Mail she did not begrudge the guard for doing what he did, declaring she 'felt very sorry for him.'

'It wasn’t his fault. There’s nothing to forgive — he was doing his job.'

She has even made a plea to Mr Heneker that if he would ever like to meet with her, to help put her brother's death behind them, she would be happy too.

'Our sympathy goes out to him because he has to live with this for the rest of his life.'

Ms Rahman said her brother was a loving father, devoted husband and a good cook who was not, to her knowledge, in any financial trouble at the time of his death.

But she didn't shy away from the fact that he was plagued by a series of past misdemeanors and battled a history of crime linked to issues with drugs and violence.

He also battled a severe bout of depression following the death of his mother and father.

Ms Rahman said it was a combination of all of these factors which brought out his self-destructive side.

'I loved my brother anyway – he was a good man, trying to provide for his family but unfortunately the other stuff in his life was almost like self-destruction,” she said.

Meanwhile, the family is still to decide whether Mr Rahman, a Muslim, will be buried here, in Sydney or back in Bangladesh.

Mr Heneker, a 27-year surf lifesaving veteran, said he was grateful for the community support he had received since the shooting, which had left him shaken. 

His lawyer Jason Jacobson said on Tuesday that his client was very emotionally and physically injured from the incident.

'He's still in a very bad way today,' Mr Jacobson told MailOnline.

'He's getting the appropriate support from medical professionals to deal with the trauma of what he dealt with yesterday.'

Mr Jacobson said the man was bashed to the head with the offender's gun and was involved in a violent struggle.

He added that his client was licensed to carry a gun and said he did not expect the man to be charged.

Rahman was unemployed and had not been charged with a criminal offence in over 15 years.

Police believe he was acting alone.

Border Security general manager Leanne Walsh said the company's wishes were with all persons involved and their families.

'We are able to report that whilst our guard was visibly upset and traumatised by yesterday’s incident, he has our full and unconditional support and is receiving counselling and assistance to get through this difficult time,' Ms Walsh said in a statement on Tuesday.

Witnesses speak with reporters after hearing shouting and gun shots outside the pub early on Monday morning

'Border Security continues to assist police with the investigation and as such, we are unable to comment any further on the incident.'

One witness said he heard 'three gun shots' and a 'couple of shouts' while he was walking nearby.

Streets were earlier shut down and the doors locked on a childcare centre with up to 30 children housed inside.

Neighbours who first raised the alarm said they saw a man run out of the tavern yelling 'Call the police' and then saw a security guard 'standing there pointing a gun at the bush'.
