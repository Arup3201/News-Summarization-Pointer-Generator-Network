Can you draw a map of the entire world from memory? You’ve probably seen it countless times - in travel guides, weather reports and at school - but recreating it on paper can be trickier that you think.

That’s what 30 students from Michigan found out when they were asked to draw the world’s continents without an atlas to guide them. 

Most people missed the UK, New Zealand, Madagascar, Scandinavia, Greenland, and a huge chunk of the Indian subcontinent.

The black and white map, compiled by Reddit user zaaakk, is a combination of 30 drawings done by students who were asked to draw the continents from memory. As well as layering the images on top of one another, zaaakk created a mockup that spliced his distorted map with geographic details captured from Nasa satellites

The size of Indonesia and the Philippines shrunk dramatically, and there was only a tiny glimpse of Antarctica in some of the drawings.

Australia, Alaska and Japan didn’t always make the cut either, and there was some debate as to how big Canada and Russia were in relation to each other.

Asia and Africa, meanwhile, were often disconnected and incredibly swollen in size, taking up large parts of the ocean.  

Reddit user zaaakk shared the results 
after digitally merging the drawings to see if they resembled anything 
close to the Earth as it is today.

The map, posted on Reddit, reveals just how little a large majority of people know about the geography of the Earth.

‘To give an idea of the population sampled, I did this in the summer of 2012 at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus,’ said zaaakk.

‘Most were 18-22, and there was a roughly even split between male and female. I'm pretty sure they were all American except one Italian guy.’

Have a go yourself and see how you do. You might surprise yourself at how much - or just how little - you remember.

Greenland and chunks of the Indian subcontinent also didn't make the cut
