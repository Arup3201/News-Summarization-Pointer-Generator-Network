This chilled out little marsupial was just trying to have his regular afternoon nap when he was set upon by two magpies who were annoyed he had stepped into their territory. 

The male koala crept into the cosy looking tree on Wednesday at Campbelltown East Public School in Sydney's south west. 

He mistakenly disturbed two nesting magpies who wanted the tree all to themselves and did not take too kindly to being interrupted. 

Not only did the magpies swoop directly at the koala but they chased him out of the tree and across the field back to the reserve where he came from.  

This koala was just having an innocent nap in a tree on the school playing field when he was set upon by two magpies 

September is the breeding season for magpies and they are known for protecting their habitats 

This relentless magpie made sure the koala would never invade her territory again 

Campbelltown Wildlife and Bushlands Protection have released the images to highlight the plight of the wildlife around Smith Creek due to redevelopment.  

A spokesman for Campbelltown Wildlife and Bushlands Protection said: 'We are trying to save the wildlife from the redevelopment in Airds where a lot of bushland has been destroyed. 

'This is pushing the koala into another part of the reserve where there is already other koalas and he's a young male and more then likely to be pushed out of Smith Creek reserve by another male koala.' 

The magpies were nesting in the tree the koala decided to have a sleep in and that is why it seems he was chased away.

They say development is pushing this young male koala out of the Smith Creek Reserve 

They fear he will be pushed into another koala's habitat and then out of the creek 

When the koala ran down the tree he made off across grassland towards the bush, he was later seen safely eating. 

It is not the first time magpies have been seen attacking recently, September is their breeding season and birds swoop to protect their young while males defend the nest. 

Trent Nicholson was attacked on his bike near Wollongong, NSW and he captured the terrifying footage on his GoPro camera and posted it on YouTube. 

Since the magpie breeding season began in September close calls with the birds have been well-documented on social media with posts from people recounting the moment they are terrorised by the bird.

Lots of close calls with angry magpies have been documented on social media in the last month 

The koala escaped to bushland at Smith Creek reserve and was safe and sound away from the magpies 

Sydney Wildlife's education officer Eira Battaglia said the best way to deal with a rogue bird was to quietly walk away.

'They can swoop past your head and it’s a warning but it's only occasionally that people have had them peck their head,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'If you stand still and put your hands over your head, they’ll stop because you’re not threatening them.

'Do not wave your arms around, walk quietly don’t make a big fuss, and they’ll leave you alone.'
