Showdown: Owen Paterson berated David Cameron

Sacked Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told David Cameron that getting rid of him was a ‘smash in the teeth’ for rural voters.

In a blunt exchange, the Right-winger launched a fierce defence of his record in a bid to keep his Cabinet post.

He told the Prime Minister sacking him would play into the hands of Ukip and demanded: ‘Do you actually want to win the Election?’

The showdown between the two, who were not alone, took place in Mr Cameron’s Commons office – and could be heard in the busy corridor outside. Within hours, details of the confrontation were circulating in Westminster bars.

Mr Paterson, 58, was one of the so-called ‘male, pale and stale’ Cabinet members fired to make way for younger, female ministers.

Known for his pro-fox hunting, anti-gay marriage and anti-EU views, and his sceptism over climate change, he was replaced by ‘Cameron Cutie’ Liz Truss.

The 38-year-old Leeds-born economist, whose parents were both Labour supporters, has no background in farming.

A senior MP said: ‘Owen was shocked to be told he was losing his job. The PM said he had to make way for new faces.’

During the 20-minute meeting, Paterson challenged Mr Cameron: ‘If you sack me it is a smash in the teeth for the 12 million people who live in the countryside. I am one of the few Conservatives who really understand them.’ The North Shropshire MP said the move risked costing the Tories the support of rural voters – and would play into the hands of Ukip. ‘If you chuck me out you are rejecting everything I have stood for,’ he protested. ‘I can out-Ukip Ukip.’

According to a well-placed source, Mr Paterson launched a passionate defence of his record, saying: ‘I have been every bit as radical in environment as Michael Gove has been at education and Iain Duncan Smith with welfare. 

Former Cabinet Minister Liam Fox, right, turned down a Foreign Office job offer by David Cameron, saying: ‘You must be bloody joking. I assume the ambassadorship to the moon is taken?’

The post was third in line at the Foreign Office – responsible for Nepal, the Maldives, Haiti and the Pacific Ocean.

Fox said he would have taken a ‘serious’ job. It was the chance of a comeback, three years after he had to resign as Defence Secretary over his dealings with best man and former associate, the lobbyist Adam Werritty.

‘I have not been afraid to take on the greens on everything, from fracking to GM foods, the badger cull, even bees!’

Mr Paterson resisted EU moves to ban pesticides blamed for hitting the bee population, claiming it could hit food production.

He went on: ‘I have reversed a 25-year consensus on the environment when it was totally dominated by the politically-correct lobbies and urban groups who know nothing about the countryside and are opposed to any form of economic growth.

‘I have proved that improving the environment and economic growth are not mutually exclusive and that you can’t have one without the other.

‘Sack me and all the green groups, Greenpeace, animal rights, people who will never vote for us, will be celebrating.

‘They’ll never vote for us anyway – and our natural supporters will think we will have abandoned them.’ A government insider said Mr Paterson’s final words to Mr Cameron were: ‘You are making a big mistake.’

The sacking of popular Mr Paterson, a skilled horseman, caused outrage in the Tory grassroots. He was the darling of the Game Fair at Blenheim Palace on Friday as well- wishers queued up to meet him. In his post-resignation letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Paterson indicated he intends to carry on speaking out.

He wrote: ‘At this critical moment in our nation’s history, I have clear ideas on the future of the UK and our place in the world. I intend to continue to serve my country and constituents from the backbenches.’

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, right, asked David Cameron to tell him he had not been given the post to ‘keep the seat warm’ for George Osborne, it was claimed last night.

A senior Government insider said he fears being forced to make way for the Chancellor if the Tories win the election next year.

Mr Osborne is open in his ambition to move to the Foreign Office, seeing it as a platform to achieve his long term aim of succeeding Cameron in Number 10.

It isn’t known if the PM gave Hammond the assurances he wanted.

 

Allies of former Education Secretary Michael Gove reacted angrily last night after it emerged that his successor Nicky Morgan has issued orders to ‘stop Gove’s war on teachers’.

Senior sources say Ms Morgan has told her department that the ‘aggressive and confrontational’ language used by her predecessor is to stop. And she has banned the use of one of Mr Gove’s favourite derogatory terms for the teaching establishment – ‘the Blob’.

But Mr Gove’s supporters called the move ‘insensitive and naïve’, and said teachers’ unions would ‘see it as a sign of weakness’. One said: ‘Nicky Morgan’s appointment is a victory for the Blob.’
