A murder investigation  was under way yesterday after the body of a young woman was found on the Queen’s estate at Sandringham.

The remains were discovered in a copse close to where senior members of the Royal Family had gathered to enjoy their Boxing Day shoot.

A dog walker stumbled across the  body at 4pm on New Year’s Day.

Detectives said it had been lying on the Norfolk estate for up to four months.

They confirmed the woman was ‘probably
 the victim of a murder’ but would not reveal how she might have been 
killed or if she was clothed.

Officers are sifting through missing 
person reports in the north Norfolk area. If this does not produce a 
match they will examine cold cases nationwide.

The Queen spent the festive period at 
Sandringham and is still in residence. She is thought to have been 
briefed by police about the investigation.

Police say the circumstances suggest that the woman was murdered and are now looking at cold case files across the country

The 30ft-wide copse where the body was
 found sits between two fields and is 200 yards along a farm track.

It 
is one mile from the entrance to Sandringham House and half a mile from 
the Sandringham Stud where the Queen breeds racehorses.

The Royal Family are thought to have been shooting in a field of sugar beet next to the copse last week.

Prince Philip, 90, normally leads 
shooting parties on the estate and has previously been seen with his gun
 in the field next to the wooded area.

However, he missed the Boxing Day 
shoot because he spent four days in Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, 
where he had a stent inserted in an artery after suffering chest pains.

He has been recovering at Sandringham since last Tuesday.

A villager said: ‘Prince Philip loves shooting in the field because it is a brilliant spot to bag birds. 

‘The beaters walk through the woods to
 scare the birds so they fly towards the guns. The copse is quite wide 
so often a lot of pheasants gather there so it means there is no 
shortage of birds flying out.

‘It is incredible to think that the Royals
 were just yards away from where this poor woman lay dead.’

The remains were found by a dog-walker in woods at the village of Anmer

Sandringham is the private country estate of Her Majesty the Queen.

It is the property of the British royal family and not part of the Crown Estate.

In 1862, Sandringham hall was purchased by Queen Victoria at the request of the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII).

But the Prince decide it was too small and had it knocked down and the current house built on the site.

King George VI was born at York Cottage on the estate and died in 1952 at the house.

Since then Queen Elizabeth spends the anniversary of her father's death and her own Accession privately with her family at the house.

It is her official base until February each year and she is joined by the rest of the Royal family over Christmas.

The house was first opened to the public in 1977, and there is a museum with displays of Royal life and Estate history.

A shoot took place on the estate yesterday. It is not known if Prince Philip took part.

The track leading to the copse remained cordoned off as officers searched for clues.

Last night Norfolk Police said the young victim had been lying on the Sandringham estate for between one and four months.

A spokesman said: ‘The pathologist believes it is highly unlikely the death was through natural causes.

‘There is no evidence of accidental 
injury, damage due to firearms or bladed weapon.’ Earlier, Detective 
Chief Inspector Jes Fry had described the case as ‘challenging’.

He said: ‘The body has been in situ 
for some time. The body is female and the circumstances indicate that 
she is probably the victim of a murder. 

‘We will be continuing our inquiries 
over the next few days and weeks to establish who she is and how she 
came to be here.

'Members of the public were walking around, but unless 
someone went into that wooded area, they would not have found her.’ 

Mr Fry added: ‘It is early days, but 
on the face of things, it could be a challenging investigation.

We will 
be looking at missing persons across the UK as well as locally.

‘We will also be using fingerprints 
and DNA to help identify the  victim.’ Mr Fry said that one of the 
missing persons cases being looked at would be that of Latvian-born  
teenager Alisa Dmitrijeva, who disappeared shortly after midnight in 
King’s Lynn on August 31. 

The 17-year-old from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, was reported missing by a relative in September.

A £5,000 reward has been offered for information that helps officers find her.

The Queen marked the start of her Diamond Jubilee year with a ride in the grounds of Sandringham House yesterday morning
