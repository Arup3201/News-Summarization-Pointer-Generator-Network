Captured in its bold brush strokes are both Lady Thatcher’s steely strength of character and the vulnerability of a woman in the closing years of her life.

The portrait was painted in 2007 by Lorna May Wadsworth, a Left-wing artist who came to adore her subject.

Thought to be the last painted depiction from the life of Britain’s greatest modern peace-time prime minister, it has been kept hidden away until now.

Bold yet vulnerable: The striking portrait of Margaret Thatcher by Lorna May Wadsworth will hang in Tory HQ

Yesterday it was unveiled in the House of Commons and will eventually hang in Tory Party headquarters.

Miss Wadsworth said: ‘I wanted my painting to elicit a reaction as far away removed from political propaganda as possible, hence the timing of its unwrapping.

‘Some people hate that I’ve painted her at all. I vividly recall her from my childhood in Northern England.

'I wanted to create an image that captured the “Iron Lady not for turning”.’

She saw Lady Thatcher at the opera one
 evening and, on the spur of the moment, gave a note to her bodyguard 
asking permission to paint her.

She persevered until granted five sittings.

Miss Wadsworth – who describes herself as a Leftie bohemian – was artist-in-residence at the 2003 Labour Party Conference.

Moved: Left-wing artist said she was moved by Lady Thatcher's gravitas and felt the urge to curtsey

This is the portrait of the former prime minister hanging in 10 Downing Street, pictured at the unveiling in 2009

Icon: In 1998, artist James Gillick painted this portrait (left) to honour Baroness Thatcher's six years as chancellor of the University of Buckingham - the only private university in the country. At the turn of the century, a photograph (right) of the former Conservative leader was unveiled in a new wing opened by the Queen

But she says of Lady Thatcher: ‘I grew fond of her. But it was like going to visit an old headmistress… you were always on your toes.

'She had tremendous gravitas. When I met her, it was all that I could do not to curtsey, and I don’t even know how.

‘But I completely adored her. I was not prepared for how lovely and kind she was… It is easy to demonise people you think have nothing in common with you.’

Painting at the ex-premier’s home in Eaton Square, she produced a portrait 6ft 6in by 6ft 6in.

Miss Wadsworth aimed to express Lady 
Thatcher’s power through the huge scale: ‘I wanted to paint her 
expressively, big brush strokes. There was human frailty there too, and 
it was moving to witness that first hand.’

Tribute: The piece has finally been unveiled just under a year after Lady Thatcher's death. Philip Mould, a former works of art adviser to the Commons, said it is 'the boldest prime minister portrait done from life'

Lady Thatcher loved the portrait – although she commented that she looked ‘very fierce’.

Miss Wadsworth said she wanted to paint a
 non-partisan image, but added: ‘If people can’t stand her, they’ll 
probably want to throw things at the portrait.

'If they love her, they might not agree with how I have chosen to paint her.’

Private collectors are said to have bought the work through dealer Philip Mould for more than £400,000 – and have loaned it to the nation.

Mr Mould, a former works of art adviser to the Commons, said: ‘It’s the boldest prime minister portrait done from life – not least because Thatcher herself was very much involved.’
