First job: Karen Matthews, who lives in a bail hostel in the south, has got a £7 per hour job as a factory cleaner

Kidnap mother Karen Matthews has got her first ever job working as a £7 per hour part-time factory cleaner, it was revealed today.

The mother, 36, was jailed after faking her nine-year-old daughter's kidnap but was released after serving just half her eight year prison sentence.

Matthews has been given a new identity after her release and was forced to sign on at a local job centre.

The mother is living in a bail hostel 
but will try and find a flat to live in with the help of a housing 
association and probation officers, the People reported.

She is planning on starting another 
family with her new lover in the south and has found employment cleaning before staff get to work each morning.

She
had seven children and lived on benefits in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, 
before she was jailed for organising the kidnap of her daughter Shannon.

A source told the People: 'Karen is a woman with a criminal record, no qualifications and no skills - and who has never worked.

'Her
work is in a factory but early in the morning before the workers clock 
on. It is the first job she has ever had, so it will be interesting to 
see if she sticks at it.'

Matthews was released from Foston 
Hall prison, near Derby, in April, with a new identity as she tries to rebuild her life.

She now has a short hair cut and has lost a considerable amount of weight.

Matthews was jailed in 2008 for the horrifying crime of kidnapping her own daughter and doping her up with temazepam and travel sickness pills.

She made a plea on national television for her daughter to be returned. She was chasing £50,000 of reward money when she tried to con police into thinking a predator had kidnapped her daughter.

Matthews found a new love after he began writing to her when she was 
behind bars and now, according to relatives, she wants to
have his children.

But the
mother could yet face fresh court action after a probe into alleged 
benefit fraud was reopened.

Investigators are examining more than 
£100,000 she is believed to have pocketed between 2004 and 2009.

Matthews was entitled to much of it - including thousands of pounds in child benefit.

Government officials are understood to be analysing the rest of her claims to make sure she really was entitled to it.

Matthews is said to have claimed up to
£400 a week in benefits while living with supermarket fishmonger Craig 
Meehan who earned £16,000 a year.

She
told officials at the time she got no child support from the five men 
who fathered her children and was therefore due the cash.

Matthews was given a full
makeover including a new hairstyle before her release to prevent her 
being recognised in the street, and now lives under an assumed name.
