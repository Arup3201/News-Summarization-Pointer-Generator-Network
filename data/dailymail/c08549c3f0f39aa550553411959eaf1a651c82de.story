It's the luxury Ibizan villa where William and Kate once enjoyed  a romantic getaway – now holidaymakers can enjoy the same experience... provided they can stump up the £20,000-a-week rent.

Kate’s ‘black sheep’ uncle Gary Goldsmith has started marketing the La Maison de Bang Bang – supposedly named after the island’s ‘banging’ dance music scene – as a high-class getaway.

In 2006 the Royal couple stayed at the house, where IT recruitment millionaire Mr Goldsmith, 48, was once caught apparently chopping up lines of cocaine in a tabloid sting.

Dipping into the savings: The villa has a swimming pool as luxurious as you would expect for £20,000 a week

Hit the decks: Prince William tried his hand at DJing on this terrace when he and Kate Middleton stayed in 2006

Perfectly luxurious: Gary Goldsmith put the villa on the market for £6million last year, but couldn't find a buyer

At your service: A peculiar statue of a moustachioed butler delivering champagne is just one quirky feature

Unconventional figure: Mr Goldsmith is a self-made millionaire whose reported drug problems and disregard for convention has nevertheless made him an embarrassment to the Royal family and the Middletons

Last year he put it on the market for £6 million, but with no buyers, he’s renting it out through a website full of glossy pictures – and spelling mistakes.

For example, it boasts that staff can organise activities such as ‘raikhi [and] body ballencing’ and can ‘help with vegitarian cuiseen, as well as help drive you around a bit and sort tables at clubs and resturants’. There’s also a ‘Jacquzzi’.

Quirky decor includes two gold thrones, a curious statue of a moustachioed butler and a 12ft Buddha overlooking a pool terrace where William tried his hand as a DJ.

But there is one drawback: the villa is near the flightpath for Ibiza airport, just two miles away.

Dream getaway: The villa has two master suites and two smaller bedrooms

Sofa, so good: The luxurious lounge benefits from patio doors with views extending out towards the pool

A good taste in music: The dining room features a jukebox and a grand table with space for ten at supper time

Dramatic: The pool seems lit in glorious ultraviolet at night - which is perhaps another nod to Ibizan rave culture

Semi-literate: The website advertising the luxurious villa for rent is littered with spelling mistakes

Jet set: The villa's location, near the Ibiza airport runway, means tenants may want to keep the music turned up
