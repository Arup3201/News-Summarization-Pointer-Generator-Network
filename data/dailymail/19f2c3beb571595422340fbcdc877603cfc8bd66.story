Statement florals are in abundance and clash with arty prints on a chic shift dress and shirt

The line, said to reflect Coleen's signature style, consists of a range of feminine, figure enhancing pieces.

Statement prints are in abundance as arty florals clash with fat checks on a chic shift dress and shirt. Meanwhile deep plum tailored shorts are paired with striking loose-fitting blouses. 

A cerise jersey top gives a nod to the sports luxe trend and is worn effortlessly with an up to the minute statement bomber and curve hugging jeans.  

Coleen's trademark easy to wear dresses are back with a paisley pastel day dress and sophisticated bold print illusion dress.

'Summer clothes and swimwear are all about feeling confident and enjoying colours and prints,' says Coleen.

'My collection for Littlewoods is designed to celebrate women's figures allowing them to choose the styles and trends that suit their body shape.'

Perhaps showing that she's a savvy business women, the Livepudlian no longer
 just creates styles for women. As a mother to Kai, three, and Klay, who

nursery collection for Littlewoods.

With sunbathers in mind, many of the items are halter-necked or stapless to prevent unsightly tan lines.

Speaking to the Mirror, Coleen reveals in a new interview that she suffers from body hang-ups, 
and is not always confident slipping into a bikini on her holiday.

'My main problem area is my love 
handles so I don't want to wear anything tight around my hips. Thin, 
stringy, tie-side briefs aren't flattering so I always go for big bikini
 bottoms,' she said.
