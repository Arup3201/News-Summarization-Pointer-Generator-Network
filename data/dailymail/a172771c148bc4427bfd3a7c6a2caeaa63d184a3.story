Stunt cyclist Danny MacAskill has completed the biggest ever loop-the-loop on a bicycle - while floating on a barge on the Thames. 

The Scottish YouTube sensation rode down a 60ft ramp and into the 16.5 ft diameter loop on a 500 tonne barge near to the London Eye. 

The gravity-defying stunt took hours to practice, and the 28-year-old didn't disappoint the watching crowds, even finishing with a trademark trick at the end.

'This is one of the biggest set-ups I have ever ridden and the location is amazing,' said MacAskill.

'To have a five-metre loop floating on a barge is something surreal. I always look for new challenges and the chance to ride this massive loop with the help of Cortana is another achievement I can be proud of.'

The Scotsman was performing alongside the launch of Cortana, the most personal digital assistant on the market available on Windows Phone devices.

Microsoft's personal assistant Cortana is renowned for her instantaneous, intelligent and customised approach - she knows what you want and how to #makeithappen. With her proactive help, useful advice and instant solutions, MacAskill was able to fulfil a life-long aspiration seamlessly.

The loop-the-loop stunt adds to Danny MacAskill's hugely impressive collection of challenges including the 'Imaginate' video, which has already received over 27 million views and 'Way Back Home' boasting over 32 million views.

Cortana acted as MacAskill's personal assistant throughout his training for the activation, arranging his meetings, setting appointment reminders, playing his favourite music, warning for bad weather and finding maps.

'A career as a professional athlete can be quite hectic and as I prefer to spend as much time on my bike as possible – any help in organising meetings, travel plans and projects is great,' added the Scot.

Adam Johnson, marketing director of mobile devices at Microsoft added: 'We've designed Cortana to be the most personal digital assistant – she adapts to individual personalities, learning by experience to become not only an instant reactive helper, but also an indispensable proactive influence. 

'Danny's London stunt is proof that she can enable even the most outlandish inspirational ideas to become reality,' said Adam Johnson, marketing director mobile devices at Microsoft.'
