A Missouri inmate was put to death in the early hours of this morning for  killing  two people during a restaurant robbery in 1998, the eighth execution in the state this year

Earl Ringo Jr, 40, was executed at 12:22am by lethal injection after a plea to halt the process - based on irregularities in the use of lethal injection drugs in the state - was refused.

Ringo's last words came from the Quran and expressed belief and wishes for after death. He wiggled his feet as the process began, breathed deeply a few times, then closed his eyes, all in a matter of seconds.

Earl Ringo Jr., 40, wiggled his feet as the execution began, breathed deeply a few times, then closed his eyes, all in a matter of seconds.

He had declined to request a last meal, eating instead the Salisbury steak and macaroni and cheese offered to other inmates.

In the early hours of July 4, 1998, Ringo and an accomplice killed delivery driver Dennis Poyser and manager trainee JoAnna Baysinger at a Ruby Tuesday restaurant in Columbia.

Both victims were shot dead at point-blank range.

The run-up to Ringo's execution was shrouded by controversy, as Missouri continues to use the  sedative, midazolam, despite claims that the pre-execution drug is inhumane.

Midazolam came under scrutiny  after it was used three in botched executions earlier this year in Ohio, Oklahoma and Arizona.

In April, gruesome scenes accompanied the execution of Clayton Lockett, a  murderer and rapist who shot his 19-year-old victim and ordered a friend to bury her alive.

It was a full 43 minutes after the drug was administered in the Oklahoma execution chamber  that the convicted killer died. During this time, Lockett thrashed violently, lurching forward against his restraints, writhing and attempting to speak.

Willie Trottie, who turned 45 Monday, shot and killed 24-year-old Barbara Canada, and her  brother, Titus. His execution is also scheduled for today.

Witnesses described his body twisting, and his head reaching up from the gurney, before the curtains were drawn around the chamber obscuring Lockett's final minutes from public view.

In January, convicted murderer and rapist Dennis McGuire appeared to gurgle, gasp for air and convulse for around 10 minutes after being sentenced to death using an experimental two-drug concoction including midazolam. 

Chilling scenes also occurred in the Arizona execution chamber in July, when Joseph Rudolph Wood took nearly two hours to die from the lethal injection. 

Witnesses told how the murderer appeared to be struggling to breathe after the sedation and then gasped desperately for breath at least 600 times before falling still. 

Ringo's attorneys had argued that the drug could dull his senses and leave him unable to express any pain or suffering during the process.

They had asked a federal appeals court to postpone the execution until a hearing over Missouri's use of midazolam. 

Attorney Richard Sindel claimed that Missouri's use of midazolam essentially violates its own protocol, which provides for pentobarbital as the lone execution drug. But the courts and Gov. Jay Nixon had refused to halt Ringo's execution over the concerns.

The Missouri Department of Corrections says it administers midazolam before executions and not as part of its execution protocol.

'It should not be lost in the national debate over the death penalty that Earl Ringo Jr. was responsible for the murders of two innocent Missourians. For 16 years he avoided payment for this crime. Tonight he has paid the penalty,' Missouri's Attorney General, Chris Koster, said in a statement.

A clemency petition to Nixon had also cited concerns about the fact that Ringo was convicted and sentenced to death by an all-white jury.

On July 3, 1998, Ringo told his accomplice Quentin Jones about his plan to rob the Ruby Tuesday restaurant in Columbia, where he once worked. Jones agreed to join him.

Before sunrise on July 4, Ringo and Jones hid behind a grease pit in the back of the restaurant. Poyser and Baysinger arrived and entered the restaurant. Ringo followed them and shot Poyser, 45, killing him instantly.

He then ordered Baysinger, 22, to open a safe. She pulled out $1,400 and gave it to him.

Ringo gave the gun to Jones, who stood with the weapon pointed at Baysinger's head for a minute and a half before pulling the trigger.

Interviews with restaurant workers and former workers led police to Ringo. Detectives found a blue ski mask, gun receipt, bulletproof vest and other evidence at the home of his mother.

Happ - who raped and killed Angie Crowley, 21, in 1986 - died by lethal injection in 2013

William Happ, 51, was the first death row inmate to be injected with midazolam hydrochloride.

The execution began at 6.02pm at Florida State Prison. Happ's eyes opened and he blinked several times.

He closed  and opened them again two minutes later. He then yawned and his jaw dropped open.

At 6.08pm, the official overseeing the execution tugged at Happ's eyelids and grasped his shoulder to check for a response. There was none.

A minute later, Happ's head began moving back and forth and shortly thereafter his breathing stopped. 

He was pronounced dead at 6.16pm.

Ringo admitted to the robbery but claimed the shootings were in self-defense. He was convicted in 1999 and sentenced to death.

Jones, of Louisville, Kentucky, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison, but he was spared the death penalty when he agreed to testify against Ringo.

Jama Brown, who was married for to Poyser for 24 years, asked that people remember the victims.

'I can only tell you there is not a day that goes by that I don't think of him or wonder what my life would be like today, not only for myself, but for my kids,' she said. 

In a statement she added: 'Please do not make this about how executions shouldn't take place. Put your effort on how we can stop people from committing these terrible actions.

'Please remember these two wonderful people who just wanted to go to work on the Fourth of July to support their families.'

Ringo's execution is the eighth in the state this year and the tenth since November.

St. Louis Public Radio reported last week that Missouri administered midazolam to all nine inmates put to death since November. Corrections department spokesman David Owen said midazolam 'is used to relieve the offender's level of anxiety' and is not part of the actual execution process.

The execution was one of two scheduled for today in the U.S. This afternoon Texas plans to execute Willie Trottie  for killing his common-law wife and her brother in 1993.

Trottie's execution will be Texas' eighth this year. Florida has performed seven executions in 2014, and all other states have a combined six.

Both Missouri and Texas use pentobarbital as their execution drug but decline to disclose where the drug is obtained.

'They don't tell you what it is and where it comes from,' Trottie told The Associated Press. 'What I've learned in 20 years here on death row is all you can do is say, 'OK.'

'I'm ready whichever way it goes. If God says, 'Yes,' I'm ready.'

Trottie, who turned 45 Monday, shot and killed 24-year-old Barbara Canada, and her 28-year-old brother, Titus, at the Canada family home in Houston. Canada's mother and sister were also wounded.

Lawyers for Trottie argued in their appeal that the one-time deliveryman and security guard suffered poor representation in his initial trial. 

They said his counsel failed to present witnesses who would have told jurors Trottie and Barbara Canada were romantically engaged at the time of the killings. Late Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the appeal.

Trottie said he and Barbara Canada were on 'good terms' despite an on-again, off-again relationship. Trottie said he was defending himself against Titus Canada, who shot first. He said the shooting of his wife was accidental.

'It wasn't like I just walked in there and gunned her down,' he said.

Johnny Sutton, the lead prosecutor at Trottie's trial, said evidence showed that's exactly what happened.

'He hunted them down,' Sutton said. 'The self-defense claim is absolutely ridiculous. He kicked in their door. ... They already were worried about him. He was making threats and trying to run her off the road.

'This one was so cold and calculated.'
