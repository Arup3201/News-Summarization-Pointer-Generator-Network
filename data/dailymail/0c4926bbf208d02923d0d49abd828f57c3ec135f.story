The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) says that 'full term' should be considered to be between 39 weeks and 40 weeks six days

Babies should be considered premature even if they are born after 38 weeks, experts claimed yesterday.

Up to now, babies were defined as ‘full term’ if they were born anytime from 37 to 42 weeks in the womb.

They were only regarded as premature if they were born before the 37-week mark.

But American doctors believe the ideal pregnancy is two weeks longer.

Research shows babies born at 37 weeks are more at risk of complications, such as breathing problems, than those born at 39 weeks.

New guidelines released by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists yesterday redefine the timeline for a healthy pregnancy.

They say a full-term pregnancy is between 39 weeks and 40 weeks and six days.

An ‘early term’ or premature baby would be born between 37 weeks and 38 weeks and six days.

A late term pregnancy reaches the 41st week and by 42 weeks the baby is ‘post term’ or in other words, long overdue.

‘Weeks matter,’ said Dr Jeffrey Ecker of Massachusetts General Hospital, who chaired the committee that came up with the more specific labels. ‘Since babies’ outcomes can differ, let’s not call it all the same,’ he added.

In recent years, doctors’ groups have stressed that elective deliveries – inductions and C-sections scheduled without a medical reason – shouldn’t happen before the 39th week of the pregnancy. Dr Ecker said the new definitions would help doctors communicate that message.

The March of Dimes Foundation, a US group that works to improve the health of mothers and babies, welcomed the change yesterday.

On average, a pregnancy lasts for 40 weeks, counting from the first day of the mother's last period. Prior to the new guidelines being released, a baby was considered to be premature if it was born before 37 weeks, and late if it was born after the 42nd week

A spokesman said it ‘eliminates confusion about how long an uncomplicated, healthy pregnancy  should last.’

According to a joint study published last year by Columbia University Medical Centre and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, children born at 37 or 38 weeks did worse in academic tests than those born just a week or two later.

The additional time in the womb results in more brain development and, in later life, better scores in mathematics and reading tests.

The 2012 study compared birth records and test scores for 128,000 eight year olds born in New York City in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

All were born between the normal 37 and 41 weeks of gestation.

Compared with those born at 41 weeks, children born at 37 weeks faced a 33 per cent  increased chance of having severe reading difficulties and a 19 per cent greater chance of having moderate problems in maths. Those born at 38 weeks fared only slightly better than those born at 37 weeks.

Another UK study found premature babies are twice as likely to suffer from severe mental conditions such as depression than those born on schedule.

It says these guidelines would prevent early elective deliveries which can lead to health complications, such as breathing difficulties

Currently, a baby is considered to be 'full term' if it is born between weeks 37 and 42 of pregnancy

But there are no plans to change the guidelines in the UK
