More than 100 women have been named on a list of Britain’s wealthiest 1,000 people – but just two of those made their own fortunes, it has been revealed.

Many were wealthy from inheritance or shared their wealth with their husbands, while some gained their fortunes from divorce settlements.

In total, there were 114 women on the latest Sunday Times Rich List – down from 118 last year, but up from a decade ago.

The list revealed that Britain's 1,000 wealthiest people are twice as rich as they were when the economic crash hit.The mega-rich have a combined fortune of £519billion – and have never been better off.

It comes as high profile divorces continue to play a part in adding to the number of female multimillionaires.

Galina Besharova, the 55-year-old former wife of the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, is said to have walked away with £100million when she and her husband divorced.

And former Armani model Slavica Ecclestone, became one of the richest women in Britain following her divorce from Bernie Ecclestone.

Her wealth is said to be £740million  making her the 136th richest individual in the country.

Asked why there were not more self-made female millionaires in Britain, Kate Grussing, the boss of executive recruitment firm Sapphire Partners, said: ‘Women are not less able – they may be less pushy and demanding.’

Kirsty Bertarelli, 42, is the richest woman in Britain, worth £9.75billion with her husband Ernesto, a Swiss businessman.

The Staffordshire-born former Miss World contestant said: ‘I am a girl from the North who has been incredibly lucky in life.’

Meanwhile, The
 Queen’s wealth rose by £10million to £330million as the value of 
personal property such as Sandringham and Balmoral rose, although her 
ranking fell from 268th to 285th.

Emma Watson has amassed a fortune of £30 million

Actress Emma Watson's wealth has soared to £30 million, making her Britain's 20th richest person under-30.

Miss Watson, 24, who appeared in Noah with Russel Crowe and is about to leave Brown University made £3 million last year.

There were 114 women on the Sunday Times Rich List this year - down from 118 last year.

But the figure is up nearly 50 per cent over the last decade from 78 in 2004. Below is a list of the five richest women in Britain:

1. Kirsty Bertarelli is worth £9.75billion with her husband Ernesto, a Swiss businessman involved in pharmaceuticals. The pair are fifth over all on the list.

2. Kirsten Rausing, worth £8.8billion with brother Jorn through inheritance and investment. They are both on the board of Swiss-based packaging group Tetra Laval and rank eighth on the list.

3. Charlene De Carvalho-Heineken, worth £6.365billion with husband Michel de Carvalho through inheritance, banking and brewing. She is the daughter of the late Freddy Heineken and, together with her husband, is 12th of the nation's rich list.

4. Carrie Perrodo is worth £6.14billion with son Francois and Perrodo family through gas, wine and oil putting them 14th on the list. The family runs a company with oil fields around the world built up by her late husband.

5. Lady Tina Green, worth £3.88billion with husband Sir Philip Green through retailing. The pair live in Monaco and are 21st on the rich list.

The combined total of the nation's mega-rich has risen 15 per cent from the previous high of £449billion last year, and is a huge leap from £258billion in 2009.

At £255billion, the joint fortune of 
the 64 richest is equal to the total wealth of the poorest 19million 
people in Britain, or 30 per cent of the population.

Britain
 also has 104 billionaires – more than ever – compared with 30 a decade 
ago, according to the latest Sunday Times Rich List.

The amount of money needed to join the ranks of Britain’s 1,000 richest is £85million, up from £80million in 2008 during the pre-crash boom.

The top ten billionaires on the list have a combined wealth of £96.62 billion

The UK now
 has more billionaires per capita than any other country, with one for 
every 607,692 people, compared with one in every 1,022,475 in the US. 
London alone has 72 billionaires, way ahead of Moscow’s 48 and New 
York’s 43.

Forty
 per cent of Britain’s billionaires were born outside the UK, while many
 pay little or no income tax because their main homes are abroad.

Philip Beresford, who has compiled the list since 1989, said: ‘I’ve never seen such a phenomenal rise in personal wealth.’

The
 figures show that the worst financial crisis since the Great 
Depression, which started six years ago when US bank Lehman Brothers 
collapsed, has been kind to Britain’s ultra-wealthy.

Critics say their increasing fortunes prove the gap between the rich and poor is widening as wages fall in real terms.

But
 Mr Beresford said: ‘The richest have had an astonishing year, and while
 some may criticise them, many of these people are at the heart of the 
economy and their success brings more jobs and more wealth for the 
country.’

So-called old money was largely unaffected by the economic crisis, and in many cases fared extremely well.

The
 sixth Duke of Westminster, who owns 300 acres of Mayfair and Belgravia 
and much of Oxford Street in Central London, saw his wealth climb by 
£700million last year to £8.5billion and is tenth on the rich list.

Global
 industries came up trumps, with Indian-born Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who 
have interests in oil, automotive, banking, property and media, top the 
list with a joint fortune of £11.9billion.

They
 knock Alisher Usmanov off the top after the metals and mining magnate, 
who has a 30 per cent stake in Arsenal FC, saw his fortune fall to 
£10.6billion. The third richest, Lakshmi Mittal, made his £10.25billion 
fortune in the steel business.
