Consultant Rod Irvine who has been suspended amid an ongoing investigation into his treatment of thousands of women 

An NHS gynaecologist being investigated over botched surgery has been linked to the deaths of at least three women, nearly 100 cases of serious injury and an allegation of sexual assault, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Consultant Rod Irvine has been suspended amid an ongoing investigation into his treatment of thousands of women across several hospitals over a two-year period.

Nearly 100 women are planning legal action against Mr Irvine in what could become one of the biggest surgical scandals in recent years and may leave the NHS with a multi-million pound legal bill.

Police confirmed Mr Irvine also faces a criminal investigation over an allegation he sexually assaulted a patient during an examination.

Lawyers acting on behalf of women treated by Mr Irvine say the claims include operations on the wrong part of the body, inappropriate treatment, punctured organs and delayed cancer diagnoses.

An investigation by this newspaper has found:

Mr Irvine, 61, who was based at Queen Mary’s Hospital, Sidcup, South-East London, was suspended by hospital bosses in November 2012 when concerns were raised following a routine audit of his operations. 

In July 2013, the NHS wrote to 2,000 women informing them they were carrying out a review of patients treated by the surgeon between August 2010 and August 2012.

At the same time, they informed the Metropolitan Police after a woman in her 50s claimed she had been sexually assaulted by Mr Irvine during an appointment in November 2011. 

He was interviewed in May 2014 under caution but not arrested, and police confirmed an investigation was ongoing.

The surgeon is being investigated by the General Medical Council and has been banned from carrying out private work. He is allowed to work for the NHS under strict supervision but has not done so. 

Jack Sargent’s mother, Susie, died in January 2010 aged 48 following complications from an operation to remove a fibroid. Mr Sargent, 21, from Welling, Kent, said his mother bled heavily after surgery and should have been given a hysterectomy because it was discovered during the operation that she was suffering from a more serious condition.

She died after developing a blood clot which travelled to her lung. Mr Sargent met with investigators at the Trust and said: ‘They told me my mum’s case was one of the ones brought forward as someone whose death needed to be investigated.’

Legal firms are now representing women treated by the surgeon. Irwin Mitchell confirmed it had been instructed by 20 women, Bolt Burdon Kemp is dealing with 28 claimants, Powell & Co has five cases and Hodge Jones & Allen has a further two. Dozens of other potential claims are being assessed.

Esther Wilkinson, a medical negligence solicitor at Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘Our clients have suffered life-changing injuries and we are investigating allegations against Mr Irvine including alleged delays in the diagnosis of cancer, a failure to follow clinical protocols, and serious surgical errors.’ 

The NHS Litigation Authority has reached an agreement with the law firms to enable claims to be settled out of court, but no settlements have yet been reached.

Mr Irvine’s employer, South London Healthcare NHS Trust, was dissolved in October 2013 after experiencing financial difficulties. His employment automatically transferred to King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, but a spokesman for the Trust said Mr Irvine had not worked at any of its hospitals.

He said: ‘Mr Irvine has been employed by King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust since our acquisition of the Princess Royal University Hospital [PRUH] in October 2013. He has not worked at any of our hospitals during that time.

‘We are aware that a group of patients have raised concerns about the level of care provided to them prior to us taking over the PRUH.’

Last night Mr Irvine denied any wrongdoing and said his supporters claimed he was the victim of a ‘witchhunt’. He said his complication rate was ‘within national standards’. He added a Trust investigation into Mrs Sargent’s death ‘did not uphold any allegations’ made against him.
