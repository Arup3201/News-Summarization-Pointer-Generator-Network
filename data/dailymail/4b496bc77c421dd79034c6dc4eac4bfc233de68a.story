England captain Wayne Rooney was in buoyant mood as he linked up with the rest of the squad for the first time since being named captain.

The 28-year-old was named as Steven Gerrard's successor last week, which would have topped off a exciting few weeks for the Manchester United forward, after just recently being made captain for his club side.

Just 10 outfield players were deemed fit enough to take part in England's first training session since their disappointing World Cup campaign.

Power: James Milner looks to hold off the challenge of Rooney during the training session at London Colney

Jack Colback, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Danny Rose and Gary Cahill suffered injuries over the weekend and were therefore excluded from Monday's session at London Colney.

The England medical team will assess the four players before deciding whether any replacements are needed ahead of Wednesday's friendly against Norway.

England manager Roy Hodgson is already without 12 senior players so he will be hoping for no more withdrawals.

Fabian Delph, Calum Chambers, Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson all undertook light recovery sessions indoors because they played for their respective clubs on Sunday.

The other 13 players, including goalkeepers Joe Hart, Ben Foster and Fraser Forster, trained as normal on a wet morning at Arsenal's Hertfordshire training base.

England, who finished bottom of their World Cup group, face Norway at Wembley on Wednesday and then fly to Basle five days later to take on Switzerland in their first Euro 2016 qualifier.

As a result of England's poor World Cup showing, the Football Association are expecting a record low crowd of between 35,000 and 40,000 at Wembley on Wednesday.
