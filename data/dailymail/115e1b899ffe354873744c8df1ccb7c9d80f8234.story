The first ambulance crew to arrive at Sydney Cricket Ground to treat Phillip Hughes came from almost 10km away from the city's busy inner west, paramedics have claimed.

The Australian Paramedics Association says the vehicle from Summer Hill, in Sydney's inner west, was the closest vehicle to the ground when the first emergency call was made at 2.29pm on Tuesday afternoon.

Questions have been asked as to why an ambulance took 23 minutes to arrive at the SCG when the normal response time is under 10 minutes. The delay prompted Health Minister Jillian Skinner to demand the head of Ambulance NSW offer an explanation.

The first ambulance crew to arrive at Sydney Cricket Ground to treat Phillip Hughes came from Summer Hill, almost 10km away from the stadium

The first triple-0 call from the SCG was made on Tuesday at 2:29pm, almost six minutes after Phillip Hughes was struck in the head by a ball during a match. 

That ambulance did not arrive until 23 minutes after the call, apparently due to a lack of vehicles in the area, paramedics say

The ambulance which responded to the first emergency call did not arrive at the SCG until 23 minutes after the call, apparently due to a lack of vehicles in the area.

According to Sydney Morning Herald, Gary Wilson, the secretary of the Australian Paramedics Association of NSW, claimed that there was a backlog of patients at Sydney hospitals at the time of the accident, meaning paramedics could not respond to new emergencies. 

'Standard practice is that, if there's no ambulances available in the immediate vicinity, they will send the closest available resource. Our understanding is that, in the Hughes incident, that crew was from Summer Hill,' he said. 

 The ambulance service has been criticised in recent days for taking so long to respond to the first emergency call made from the SCG

When the first ambulance failed to appear at the SCG, officials at the SCG made a second triple-0 call.

The second triple-0 call was made at 2:37pm and an ambulance was sent to the SCG from the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, arriving seven minutes later at 2:44pm and before the first ambulance. 

According to Mr Wilson, it is likely an ambulance had been freed up between the first and second triple-0 calls, possibly by offloading a patient or another emergency call being cancelled.

Mr Wilson also said that trolley-block was a major source of frustration for paramedics. 

Trolley-block happens when the hospitals are overcapacity and therefore there are delays in responses to emergency calls. 

In a statement, NSW Ambulance clarified that all measures were taken to ensure the closest ambulance was dispatched to the SCG.

'The NSW Ambulance Helicopter, with a specialist doctor and paramedic on board, as well as another road ambulance were tasked to respond while the first two ambulances were en-rout,' the statement read.

'St Vincent’s was identified as the closest hospital. A road ambulance transport was determined by the medical team to be the fastest and safest route to hospital care,'

'NSW Ambulance always tasks the closest available paramedic crew to all Triple Zero (000) emergency calls regardless of the station at which their shift originates,'

Mr Hughes was taken to St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney with significant head injuries. 

The 25-year-old died due to severe head injuries sustained by a bouncer at the Sydney Cricket Ground

He underwent major surgery but died on Thursday afternoon. 

25-year-old Phillip Hughes was due to turn 26 on Sunday.  

The Australian Paramedics Association of NSW have blamed budget cuts on the delays in ambulance responses and highlighted the daily issues faced by paramedics.

'Consideration was given to seeking a meeting with the Minister for Health however based on the continued position of the Ministry of Health that no funds are available or will be made available to fund additional positions this was not seen as a productive option,' they said.

'The continued line that an additional 5% is added to the NSWA budget each year is not satisfactory as it is being swallowed up by other costs.' 

The APA continue in light of the tragedy, claiming that they are forced to deal with limited resources and their pleas for additional funds and facilities are falling on deaf ears. 

'As tragic as this recent event is in the public eye, paramedics see this type of tragedy on a regular basis. Is it any wonder why profession has a high incidence of suicides and post traumatic stress disorder?' the statement said. 

NSW Ambulance told Daily Mail Australia that they will not be making any further comment on the incident,pending an inquiry into their practices.
