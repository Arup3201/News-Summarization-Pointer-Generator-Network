Bacary Sagna is set to play his final Barclays Premier League game for Arsenal against Norwich on Sunday after claiming he is likely to leave the Emirates Stadium.

The Frenchman, who has been at Arsenal since 2006 and current deal expires in the summer, is in the midst of a contract wrangle with the Gunners

Sagna is expected to enter talks with Manchester City after the FA Cup final against Hull in six days time.

'I'm out of contract, as everyone knows. I still consider myself as an Arsenal player at present,' Sagna told Europe1.

'But actually we had a small problem to agree with the club, and I don't think I'll stay at Arsenal at the end of the season.'

Sagna’s advisers have already held talks with numerous overseas clubs including Paris Saint-Germain, Galatasaray and Inter Milan. But transfer regulations forbid discussions with clubs in the same country until the end of the season.

Sagna, 31, intends to hold talks with City as soon as he is able to do so. Arsenal have made him a final offer of a three-year deal worth around £80,000 per week.

But the deal falls short of his £100,000-per-week demands, with sources close to the defender insisting he will reject the deal on the table.
