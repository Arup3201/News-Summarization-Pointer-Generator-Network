At least two burglars broke into a house in White Plains, New York, on Saturday and headed straight for the gun safe.

The thieves struck just three weeks after the address and home owner's name, registered to a legal firearms permit, was published on the controversial gun map published by the Journal News.

The burglars couldn't open the safe and the owner wasn't at home. But this incident has led to speculation that the map is now being used by criminals for targeted gun theft.

This home in White Plains, New York, is also listed on the controversial gun map and was broken into on Saturday

The thieves broke into the property at 9.30pm on Saturday, using a ladder to enter through a second story window.

According to Newsday, the burglars then headed for the safe where the homeowner, a man in his 70s, stores his legally owned guns.

The intruders abandoned their attempts when they couldn't crack the safe, and police say that one suspect has been taken into custody.

The home owner declined to comment while police continue their investigations but a New York state senator has again blasted the gun map after this incident.

'Criminal's shopping list?' Both homes  are featured on the map that lists the names and addresses of legal gun owners

Republican Senator Greg Ball has proposed legislation that restricts gun permit information to law enforcement authorities and he strongly criticized the Journal News.

'It is reported that the burglar used the Journal News’ interactive gun map to target a home included on the map,' Ball said in statement.

'The Journal News has placed the lives of these folks at risk by creating a virtual shopping list for criminals and nut jobs.

'If the connection is proven, this is further proof that these maps are not only an invasion of privacy but that they present a clear and present danger to law-abiding, private citizens.

'Former convicts have already testified to the usefulness of the asinine Journal News ‘gun maps’ yet the reckless editors are evidently willing to roll the dice, gambling with the lives of innocent local homeowners,' the senator continued.

'Reckless': A New York State Senator blasted the Journal News for their controversial gun map

The New York newspaper reportedly hired a team of armed guards to patrol the paper's headquarters in West Nyack after publishing the names and addresses of nearby 
gun permit owners.

The paper caused a stir on December 23 when it listed thousands of 
pistol permit holders in suburban Westchester and Rockland counties just
north of New York City in an interactive map.

The Rockland County Times reported that Journal News editor Caryn A. McBride hired gun-toting security guards to guard the paper's offices amid a flurry of angry emails and phone calls in the following days.

Along with an article entitled 'The 
gun owner next door: What you don't know about the weapons in your 
neighborhood,' the Journal News map was compiled in response to the December 14 
shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut, 
editors of the Gannett Corp.-owned newspaper said.

The publication prompted outrage, particularly on social media sites, among gun owners.

'Do you fools realize that you also 
made a map for criminals to use to find homes to rob that have no guns 
in them to protect themselves?' Rob Seubert of Silver Spring, Maryland, 
posted on the newspaper's web site. 'What a bunch of liberal boobs you 
all are.'

Calling for change: The paper said that they produced the map because in the wake of the Newtown shooting many people wanted to know who had legal guns in their neighborhood, and there were protests across the country (pictured).

The newspaper's editor and vice 
president of news, CynDee Royle, defended the 
decision to list the permit holders.

'We knew publication of the database 
would be controversial, but we felt sharing as much information as we 
could about gun ownership in our area was important in the aftermath of 
the Newtown shootings,' she said.

Some critics retaliated by posting reporters' and editors' addresses and other personal information online.

Howard Good, a journalism professor 
at the State University of New York at New Paltz, called the critics' 
response childish and petulant.

On the list: As well as Journal News the website Gawker published a 446-page list of licensed gun owners in New York City

'It doesn't move the issue of gun 
control to the level of intelligent public discussion,' he said. 'Instead, it transforms what should be a rational public debate on a 
contentious issue into ugly gutter fighting.'

Good said the information about permit holders was public and, if presented in context, served a legitimate interest.

But media critic Al Tompkins of the 
Florida-based Poynter Institute wrote online this week that the 
newspaper's reporting had not gone far enough to justify the permit 
holders' loss of privacy.

'If journalists could show flaws in 
the gun permitting system, that would be newsworthy,' he said. 'Or, for 
example, if gun owners were exempted from permits because of political 
connections, then journalists could better justify the privacy 
invasion.'

Tompkins said he feared the dispute might prompt lawmakers to play to privacy fears.

'The net effect of the abuse of public
 records from all sides may well be a public distaste for opening 
records, which would be the biggest mistake of all,' he said.
