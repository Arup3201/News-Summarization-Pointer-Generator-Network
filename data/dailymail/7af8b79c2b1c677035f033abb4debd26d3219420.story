Preparations for the Super Bowl were ramped up in the last few days as players, media and fans began to descend upon Glendale, Arizona for the blockbuster event.

Super Bowl XLIX takes place at the University of Phoenix Stadium at 11.30pm UK time on Sunday night, and the final countdown is now on.

Both the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks touched down in Arizona on Monday ahead of their blockbuster clash on Sunday when the eyes of the world will be watching.

The finishing touches have almost been applied at the 63,000-seat stadium, as well as in downtown Phoenix ready to but on a show-stopping event.

The Seahawks head to Arizona looking to become the first team to win back-to-back Super Bowls since the Patriots just over a decade ago.

Seattle's 28-22 victory over the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game will live long in the memory as they came back from the dead to win in overtime.

Now Russell Wilson, Marshawn Lynch and Co will be looking for a second Super Bowl ring on their fingers after dismantling the Denver Broncos this time last year at MetLife Stadium.

Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, meanwhile, is still chasing an elusive fourth ring that has eluded him for a decade. Since winning the biggest game in American football three times in four years between 2002 and 2005, Brady's Patriots have been to two Super Bowls but on both occasions have been beaten by the New York Giants. 

The University of Phoenix Stadium will be hosting the Super Bowl for the second time having also been the venue for the showpiece in 2008, when Brady's New England side were beaten 17-14 by the Giants.
