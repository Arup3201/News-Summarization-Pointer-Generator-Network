Mary Cheney finds it hypocritical that drag queens can impersonate women but white people cannot 'put on blackface and act out offensive stereotypes of African-Americans'.

The daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney took to Facebook to ask: 'Shouldn't both be ok or neither? Why does society treat these activities so differently?'

She wrote in a private post seen by CNN: 'Why is it socially acceptable -- as a form of entertainment -- for men to put on dresses, make up and high heels and act out every offensive stereotype of women (bitchy, catty, dumb, slutty, etc.) -- but it is not socially acceptable -- as a form of entertainment -- for a white person to put on blackface and act out offensive stereotypes of African Americans?'

Sparked outrage: Mary Cheney is under fire after posting this comment on Facebook

Cheney, pictured with her father the former Vice President Dick Cheney (right), said 'shouldn't both be ok?'

According to CNN, Cheney made clear that her words referred to men in drag, not transgender people.  

The comment was said to be prompted by a trailer for the upcoming season 7 of RuPaul's Drag Race, which debuts on March 2.

Lashing out at the 45-year-old's comments, the show's official Twitter account tweeted: 'Oh no she better don't', and shared a video titled 'a Message for Mary Cheney'.

The video takes Cheney through a history of drag, and explains that 'the most important thing of all, drag never ever takes itself too seriously'.

A lesson: The video takes Cheney through a short history of drag saying 'it doesn't take itself too seriously!'

On the show's website, a statement response to Cheney read: 'Y’know we don’t have a clear-cut answer—and maybe there isn’t one. All we know is what a queen told us once: “Drag queens don’t make fun of women, they make fun of society’s expectations of women. If you’re just insulting women that’s not drag—that’s misogyny.”'

However, they did hail Cheney, who is openly gay and married to Heather Poe, with whom she has two children, for another Facebook post recently that championed gay rights.

In it, Cheney slammed her sister Liz for opposing gay marriage, and wrote: 'Liz - this isn't just an issue on which we disagree - you're just wrong - and on the wrong side of history.'
