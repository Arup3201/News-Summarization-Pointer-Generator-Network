She has always been a fan of turning heads and making an entrance, so it was no surprise that when Lady Gaga arrived for her appearance on Good Morning on Monday she did so in typically extravagant style.

Showing off a sleek bob with blonde highlights and risqué white dress, the singer stepped out of her vintage Cadillac as she unveiled her video for Applause for the first time.

And proving she is very much human, the 27-year-old revealed that she too gets stretch marks on her cleavage, which she proudly had on display in her flimsy white bra top.

Putting her very public spat with Perez Hilton behind her, she was seen leaving her hotel in New York smiling widely - no doubt excited to finally show her fans what she has been working on.

Revealing her recently slimmed down figure, she slipped on a white dress with a plunging neckline, beneath which her white bra could be seen.

The dress featured an interesting white cape detail while the skirt, which barely covered her derriere, featured a longer section down one side.

Leggy: The star wore a very short white dress which showed off her legs as she sat in the car

Arriving in style: Lady Gaga chose a vintage Cadillac to take her to her appearance on Good Morning America on Monday

Eye-catching: The singer turned heads in her short white dress and new hairstyle 

Completing her look, she wore a typically huge pair of grey platform boots while she also slipped on a pair of white fingerless gloves.

The star, who was wearing far less make-up than usual, wasted no time in getting into her eye-catching black convertible.

It was a vastly different look to the day before, when she stepped out with almost jet-black hair styled in a rockabilly fashion.

New look: Gaga showed off new lighter hair which looked sleek in a side parting

Once she arrived at the studio to film the show, she spent time greeting the hordes of screaming fans - dubbed her ‘Little Monsters’ - who had waited to see her.

The 27-year-old chose the popular TV show to debut her new video for Applause, which is her first new visual in two years.

The hotly-anticipated video will no doubt delight her legions of loyal fans as it shows her in various states of undress against different eye-catching backgrounds.

What a difference a day makes: On Sunday the star was seen with jet black hair in curls compared to the lighter look of Monday

Fans: The singer looked really pleased that she got the chance to meet some fans who had waited to see her

Flimsy: The 27-year-old's bra top didn't really appear to be giving her much support

After two years, it’s no surprise that she was keen to impress with the latest video, which begins with her lying on a mattress in her underwear.

Other scenes show her climbing out of a giant top hat and dressed all in black with a black hat on, while dancing with a large white sheet.

She also at some points has her face covered in the rainbow-coloured, kabuki-like face paint, which features on the front of her album ARTPOP.

Here she comes: There was no missing Gaga as she drove up in her vintage car

Tricky: The star tried to protect her modesty as she got into the vehicle

Elated: It has been two years since Gaga has released a new visual so fans are unsurprisingly excited

Another shot shows her head superimposed onto a black swan, while another sees her with long blonde hair down her back with just shells covering her modesty as she dances. 

Keeping up the theme of wearing little clothing, she also slips on a top featuring two hands covering her chest as she embarks on a dance routine. 

As the video comes to an end, she shows off a more glamorous side with long hair and ethereal-inspired make-up and dress as purple glitter falls all around her.

Back appeal: Gaga's out fit showed off her wide array of back tattoos

Revealing: The cut of her black dress meant the superstar showed a lot of skin

Quick change: Gaga changed into a black dress which was more demure as she continued promotion that day

Promotion: Lady Gaga appeared on the the Z100 Morning Show, alongside someone who was inspired by her music video

Puppy love: Gaga cuddled her dog Fozzy at the Elvis Duran and the Z100 Morning Show

Following her appearance on Good 
Morning America, the star changed into a black dress, which was 
relatively demure compared to the skimpy white outfit she wore earlier.

But
 the look didn't last long, and as she left the Z100 radio station in a different 
one to which she arrived in - a purple and black leather dress.

Again opting to flash some skin, her dress featured a plunging neckline and a very short hemline.

On show: As she left the radio show she showed a lot of her chest in the plunging top

If three changes wasn't enough, the 
singer was spotted arriving back at her apartment block later that 
afternoon in yet another change of clothes.

Clearly having exposed enough flesh 
for one day, the singer covered up completely, with a black cashmere 
turtleneck jumper and white pants, which she paired with the previous 
outfit's black and gold belt and towering black boots. 

It's no wonder her frustrated longtime stylist, Nicola Formichetti, parted ways with the out-there star just last week.

Gaga apparently changes her outfits 'at least 12 times a day'.

Stylish: Gaga's purple and black leather creation was certainly eye catching

And again: As she left the radio station she wore yet another outfit- this time with a purple skirt  

All covered up: Gaga headed back to her apartment later that day with not an inch of fresh on display

On
 Sunday, Gaga took to Twitter to discuss her new video, writing: ‘OK lets 
start over! I'm so excited to see u at the premiere of my video @gma in 8
 hrs! I am grateful to share this new experience with you!

‘I've
 thought of u fans every moment since the last BTWBall & dreamt 
everyday how I could make it up to u. Only w your happiness comes mine.’

She
 added: ‘I know this sounds weird but, I can't believe I'm gonna be on 
TV today for an interview! It's been so long, I can't wait to see your 
smiles!’

Style chameleon: The singer ditched the dresses for a black cashmere turtleneck jumper and white pants, which she teamed with the previous outfit's black and gold belt and towering black boots

Different look: Gaga appears in a mermaid style ensemble in her new video

Simple: A number of the scenes are remarkably simple showing her in her underwear on a mattress
