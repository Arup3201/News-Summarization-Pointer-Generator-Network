A group of England football supporters have been injured in an alleged attack ahead of tomorrow's World Cup qualifier against Ukraine in Kiev.

Some 30 hooded Ukrainians armed with knives are said to have set upon the fans in a coffee shop last night in a busy area in the centre of the city.

Three England fans were taken to hospital following the fracas, one with a stab wound, one with a head injury, and a third with severe bruising, according to local reports.

And as the sun rose on the Ukrainian capital this morning, fresh bloodstains still covered the pavement where the fight broke out.

'Most visits are trouble free. But foreign nationals have been the victims of violent crime in Kiev and other major cities. In some cases attacks have been racially motivated.

'Travellers of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent and individuals belonging to religious minorities should take extra care.

'Be alert to the possibility of street crime and petty theft. Foreigners may appear to be lucrative targets. Where possible, avoid walking alone late at night in dark or poorly lit streets.

'Keep valuables and cash safe and out of sight, especially in crowded areas, tourist spots, and public transport, where pickpockets and bag snatchers operate.'

Ambulances arrived moments later to take the injured men to 
hospital.Following the attack, witnesses said the masked men fled into the night. Nobody has been arrested.

'Three British citizens ... were taken to hospital with wounds to the head and hands,' police said in a statement.

'After getting medical treatment they were taken back to their accommodation.'

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of incidents in Kiev involving British nationals. We are providing consular assistance.'

The exact circumstances of the fracas
 remained unclear today but police said it broke out after a handful of around 40 England fans and 20 
Ukrainians grew violent as they traded insults.

Ukrainian football has long been blighted by violent hooliganism fuelled by fierce inter-club rivalries.

Last year's Euro 2012, hosted jointly
 by Poland and Ukraine, passed largely without any major incidences of 
hooliganism amid fears neo-Nazis may hijack the tournament to unleash 
violence on foreign fans.

Hooligans: Ukrainian football has long been blighted by violent hooliganism fuelled by fierce inter-club rivalries and football gangs heavily infiltrated by neo-Nazi supporters

Just
 before the tournament began, however, about 50 hooligans punched and 
kicked foreign football fans speaking English and Russian as they drank 
in a pub in the central Polish city of Lodz.

The
 fighting broke out after Dutch players complained they were subjected 
to monkey chants while training in another Polish city, where the 
England team is based.

England top Group H with 15 points, ahead of Montenegro on goal difference. Ukraine sit third with 14 points.
