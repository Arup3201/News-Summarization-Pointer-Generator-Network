A top Dallas doctor today described the moment nurse Nina Pham learned she had contracted Ebola after caring for victim Thomas Eric Duncan in hospital, saying: 'She was scared'.

Dr Gary Weinstein worked alongside 26-year-old Miss Pham  to treat Mr Duncan, a 42-year-old Liberian who was rushed to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 28.

He said his colleague was petrified when she realised she had been infected with the deadly virus, saying: 'She risked her life to care for a patient, and now she was afraid for her life.'

But he added: 'I think once she got over the initial fear and concern and was surrounded by her friends and colleagues,  that was comforting. She did remarkably well, emotionally.'

Doctor: Dr Gary Weinstein today described the moment his colleague Nina Pham, 26, learned she had contracted Ebola after caring for victim Thomas Eric Duncan in hospital, saying: 'She was scared'

Victim: Dr Weinstein worked alongside Miss Pham (pictured, left, and, right, in hospital after her diagnosis) to treat Mr Duncan, a  Liberian who was rushed to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 28

Miss Pham, who suffered from a fever with a temperature of above 100.5 degrees prior to her devastating diagnosis, is now in a 'fair' condition at a National Institutes of Health isolation unit.

She is one of two nurses to have developed Ebola after caring for Mr Duncan, who died on October 8. 

The second worker, Amber Vinson, 29, was diagnosed with the disease on Wednesday. She was later airlifted to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital in Georgia on a specialized plane with a quarantine unit.

Speaking to WFAA-TV, Dr Weinstein insisted the two nurses - along with the rest of the team - had followed CDC guidelines, which, at the time, did not include the use of a full respiratory mask.

When asked why Miss Pham and Miss Vinson caught Ebola, he said: 'I think that these two nurses took care of a critically-ill patient at a time when he was not in control of his body fluids. 

'And at a time when the recommendations from the CDC (Centers of Disease Control and Prevention) that we were following did not include the full respiratory mask.'

Comforting: The doctor, who was behind the camera, told the brave nurse: 'Well, happy tears are okay'

Hospital: During the converstion, Dr Weinsten insisted Miss Pham - along with the rest of the team at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital (pictured) - had followed CDC guidelines during their care of Mr Duncan

His comments are in stark contrast to the CDC's claims that a 'breach of protocol' must have taken place to enable the infection to spread through the two nurses' protective gear.

The center is currently preparing to issue new guidelines on protective gear to safeguard the well-being of doctors and nurses who are caring for Ebola patients.

During the conversation, Dr Weinstei said despite knowing of Mr Duncan's contagious condition, both Miss Vinson and Miss Pham volunteered to look after him, joining an 'amazing' medical team.

'It's been so heartwarming. This kind of illness, this process that we've been through, this is the essence of nursing. This is the epitome of health care,' he said.

The doctor, who was captured on video earlier this week telling a bedridden Miss Pham not to cry - unless they were 'happy tears'' - gave the nurse a hug in his hazmat suit following her diagnosis.

He told the news station that Mr Duncan's death 10 days ago was 'very, very quick', saying: 'He was critically ill and unstable, and over a period of minutes, he lost his pulse and was dead,' 

He also revealed that, in terms of Ebola, he considered himself to be 'no risk', despite having spent days caring for all three victims of the disease at the Dallas-based hospital.

He said this was because Mr Duncan's bodily fluids were being controlled by the time he started caring for him, and he has worn a respiratory mask in the presence of all three patients.

'My only interactions with any of these patients have been in completely covered respirators, no skin showing to the outside world,' said Dr Weinstein. 'I think I'm no risk.'

However, he revealed he has been asked by officials to avoid public places and public transport, and to take his temperature on a daily basis.

According to the latest figures, the Ebola death toll has now struck 4,546, bringing the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 9,191.

Most cases of the virus have been recorded in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, all in West Africa

Symptoms of Ebola include a fever, a headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches and in some cases bleeding. These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said.

Even if a person is infected, the virus can only be passed on once symptoms appear. It is transmitted through direct contact with the affected person's bodily fluids.
