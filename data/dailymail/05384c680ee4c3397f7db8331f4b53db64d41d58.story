Stuart Lancaster's record six-year contract will not stop the England boss coaching the British and Irish Lions in 2017.

The Rugby Football Union have pledged to grant Lancaster and his coaching lieutenants leave to coach the Lions in New Zealand if the world famous touring side request their services.

Chief executive Ian Ritchie confirmed the RFU will not stand in the way of Lancaster or back-room team Graham Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt, who also penned new six-year deals this week.

'To be honest I'm not even sure if there's a specific clause in the contracts, but that's irrelevant, because our view of life is that we would be supportive,' said Ritchie.

'So if people came knocking on the door, we would regard it as an honour, both for the organisation and for the individual.

'And we would be very happy to deal with that, should it come.

'Undoubtedly when people are asked to be involved everybody should regard it as an honour to be asked.

'The Lions would need to make a request and then we would deal with it, but, in general terms, we would be supportive.'
