Listen to public anger: International Development Secretary Justine Greening said it was time tackle issues such as waste and corruption

Ministers must start listening to public anger about the soaring aid budget, instead of just ‘shouting louder’ at those who disagree, the International Development Secretary said yesterday.

In a major shift of tone, Justine Greening said it was time to start tackling public concerns about issues like waste and corruption, rather than just lecturing people about the benefits of aid.

Speaking at an event for aid charities in London, she said: ‘I know there are many people in our country who think that international development should not be a priority - that instead we should spend the money here in Britain.

'They think that the money is spent on countries that don’t use it effectively, or on projects that aren’t worthwhile.

‘And I know that the temptation for many of us when confronted by anyone arguing against you is just to argue back, just to shout louder at them.

‘But I came into politics because I believe that people have a right to be heard, and I believe that they have a right to be listened to.’

The aid budget will rise dramatically in April as the percentage of Britain’s income spent on foreign rises from 0.56 per cent to 0.7 per cent - the level controversially pledged by David Cameron.

Meeting the target will require an increase in aid spending from £8.65 billion this year to £11.3 billion next year - a rise of more than 30 per cent.

Miss Greening said ministers had to make a better case for the rapidly increasing aid budget, spelling out the potential benefits for trade and security. But she said some of the arguments raised by critics were legitimate and needed to be addressed.

‘Can we address these concerns by better explaining what we are doing and making our case, or do some of those concerns reflect genuine issues that need to be sorted out?’ she said.

‘As ever, the answer is that it’s a bit of both.’

Miss Greening, a former accountant, has introduced a series of financial controls since taking charge of the Department for International Development (Dfid) in September last year. These include slashing the size of projects that can be signed off without ministerial approval, new rules for consultants and a fresh crackdown on corruption.

But she acknowledged the need to go 
further, saying: ‘Tackling corruption means not only finding those who 
steal money but throwing the book at those outside actors in other 
countries that help it to happen - those people who pay the bribes, the 
lawyers and financiers that launder the proceeds.’

Miss Greening has suspended aid to Rwanda because of human rights and stopped payments to Uganda because of corruption.

She said the decision had been ‘difficult, but... necessary’ to retain public confidence, adding: ‘We are often working in complex situations. Even so, where we see the trend moving in the wrong direction on corruption and on human rights, we will not simply stand by and ignore that.’

But she defended the policy of targeting aid on so-called ‘fragile states’, saying: ‘It is in our national interest to support these countries. Whether it be terrorism in Afghanistan, piracy in Somalia or crime in West Africa, we know that instability overseas means we eventually foot a bigger bill here in the UK. Problems tend not to solve themselves, rather without action, they too often tend to grow.’

Miss Greening said she wanted to encourage more private sector investment in developing countries, adding: ‘To those of you who think private sector investment is part of the problem, I think you are wrong.’ She said her priorities included economic development, promoting the rights of women and girls and encouraging better value for money and transparency.
