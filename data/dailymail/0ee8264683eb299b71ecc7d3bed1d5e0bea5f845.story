They were the unseen heroes of the Second World War – the men who risked their lives to help others escape from German prisoner of  war  camps.

And none did it for longer than Alfie ‘Bill’ Fripp, an RAF navigator shot down in the first weeks of battle to become a veteran of 12 different camps across Nazi-occupied Europe.

His job was to make sure secret consignments of equipment vital for escape were smuggled in under the noses of German guards.

Squadron Leader Alfie Fripp, seen at the Zagan camp in 2009, helped 76 PoWs escape 
from Stalag Luft III in March 1944. Pictured right, in 1944, Mr Fripp was tasked with collecting Red Cross parcels for the prisoners from a depot in the nearby town, where he ‘liberated’ numerous items to help the tunnelers

Thus, you could often find Alfie 
starting a heated argument or engineering some administrative 
catastrophe to create the distraction necessary to secure and hide a 
code-marked Red Cross parcel.

In nearly six years behind barbed wire
 – through starvation, disease and Hitler’s programme of mass murder – 
his efforts helped countless others to escape and get back into the war.

He was one of the backroom boys 
involved in preparations for the Great Escape, the mass break-out from 
Stalag Luft III portrayed in the 1963 film starring Steve McQueen.

But yesterday Squadron Leader Alfred 
George Fripp, longest serving and oldest surviving British PoW and last 
of the so-called ‘39ers’, finally gave up the fight. He died peacefully 
in his sleep at the age of 98.

Alfie became a ‘39er’ when his 
Blenheim bomber was shot down in October 1939. He and surviving crew 
members, including pilot Mike Casey, were taken prisoner and shipped 
around a series of camps.

One of Alfie’s official jobs was to marshal Red Cross aid parcels, a lifeline for prisoners.

His unofficial job was to filter out the parcels coded to identify secret contents such as valves for radios or maps.

He was relocated from Stalag Luft III 
less than two months before the Great Escape, but equipment from those 
parcels almost certainly contributed to the operation.

To his eternal regret, however, his 
friend Mike Casey would be among 50 escapees slaughtered on Hitler’s 
orders when they were eventually recaptured.

Alfie was shot down over Belgium by the Luftwaffe during a reconnaissance mission. Above, on a return trip to the Zagan PoW camp four years ago

Sqn Ldr Fripp (pictured left in 2011) was transferred out of Stalag Luft III a few months before the mass break-out. He later endured the Long March of 1945, when thousands of PoWs were forced to march in winter from a camp in Zagan in Poland to Spremberg in Germany

He vividly recalled the German guards
 telling him the escaped prisoners had been executed and will never 
forget the moment they read out Casey’s name from the list.

‘We were determined not to show our anger so we just gave them three cheers,’ he said.

Three years ago Alfie, from Bournemouth, returned to the camp for the first time to pay his respects.

‘The most important thing is saying 
goodbye to those who died,’ he said at the time. ‘The huts have all gone
 but the ghosts of all those boys are here.’

Among the horrors he witnessed were 
friends dying slowly of starvation or disease, a prisoner being shot 
simply for wandering outside his hut before a dawn curfew was lifted, 
and another being machine-gunned to death as he tried to scale a 
perimeter fence.

Alfie, who was sent away to train as a
 12-year-old Royal Navy electrical apprentice, failed to graduate 
because, at 4ft 10in tall, he was too short by four inches to qualify.

Instead, he joined the RAF, which had 
no height requirement and where – in every sense – the sky was the 
limit. He married his sweetheart Vera Allen just three days after war 
was declared on September 3, 1939.

Last night his extended family – 
including nephew Robert Fripp, the former King Crimson guitarist married
 to Toyah Willcox – were mourning his loss.

Family friend Pat Jackson, whose late 
father Hank Hancock was imprisoned with Alfie, told the Daily Mail: ‘He 
and the others he was with were the unsung heroes of the war. They 
didn’t know if they would ever see home again but they never gave up the
 fight.’
