The good news for Watford is that every team to top the Championship after 15 games in the last seven years has gone on to win promotion. The bad is that it was they who last failed. Clayton Donaldson’s double - giving Birmingham just their third win of the season - will have Hornets worried that fate may befall them again.

Aidy Boothroyd was in charge back in 2007 when they spluttered and faltered, gone a year later. With the trigger happy fingers of the Pozzo family, it’s hard to envisage Slavisa Jokanovic - their latest incumbent - remaining at Vicarage Road if he doesn’t deliver Premier League football inside six months.

The Serbian is already the fourth in the  hotseat this campaign - although Oscar Garcia left on medical advice - and, despite leading the way, they don’t seem a side totally sure of themselves. It is a miracle they have kept consistent with such upheaval.

‘It’s not a good result,’ Jokanovic bemoaned. ‘We had possession of the ball but played very slowly.’

But the night really belonged to home debutant Gary Rowett and his Birmingham side - one to have languished so badly just weeks ago under Lee Clark.

Remarkably this was only their second home win in over 12 months and you could tell when the final whistle eventually blew. The jubilant new boss - who has breathed fresh life into this part of the Midlands already - span with clenched fists to his bench; St Andrew’s roared ferociously, and it’s been a while since that last happened. The relief was palpable.

Rowett was keen to remain grounded. ‘We kept control and played with discipline,’ he said. ‘We’ve had 18 shots on goal against a team top of the league. But this just the start. It showed what we could do.'

Under Clark Birmingham were dreadful at home - barely capable of stringing passes together let alone a sustained run of results. What Rowett is doing is bringing the feelgood factor back.

'They were ready to get behind something tonight,' the manager added. 'There had been a bit of fear beforehand. It should be enjoyable to go out there and play in front of that crowd.'

He has engineered an immediate reaction with four points from his first two games, and they set off meaning business here. Koby Arthur saw a menacing strike blocked in the opening seconds before Donaldson - who had scored just twice all season - latched on to a Stephen Gleeson cross to prod in the opener inside two minutes.

They weren’t ahead for long. Watford pressed, Darren Randolph did excellently to thwart the unmarked Fernando Forestieri’s effort, but the rebound fell back to the Argentine to level up just five later.

Parity, and quickly. But Rowett has instilled an impressive steel in a week.

What’s also clear is that the 40-year-old’s enthusiasm is infectious. When Andy Shinnie somehow headed over, the boss dashed to the touchline to applaud Paul Caddis’ centre rather than pout. They aren’t used to that around these parts.

Randolph made a stunning one-handed save to deny a vicious Troy Deeney thump, but the Blues always looked more likely.

Sustained pressure paid with five minutes left on the clock - Donaldson, all alone six yards out, planting a header beyond former Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes to give hope to a club who appeared to have none.
