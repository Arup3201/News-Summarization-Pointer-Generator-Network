Charla Nash, the Connecticut woman who lost her eyesight, lips, 
nose, and hands when she was mauled by a chimpanzee in 2009, has been denied permission to sue the state.

Her family sought permission to sue for $150 million but was denied on Friday by state Claims Commissioner J. Paul Vance Jr.

Connecticut has 'sovereign immunity' from lawsuits unless they're allowed by the commissioner.

Nash's lawyer had said the state should be 
held responsible for failing to seize the animal before the attack, because 
it was warned the animal was dangerous.

Vance said in his decision that at 
the time of the attack, state law did not prohibit the private ownership
of chimpanzees and did not require the state to seize an animal that 
was privately owned and not banned by the state.

Vance noted that the state banned the ownership of chimpanzees after the attack.

'The State of Connecticut, were it a 
private person, would generally not have any duty to control the conduct
of (a) third party absent some special relationship,' Vance wrote.

Nash has a chance to appeal to the state General Assembly to reverse Vance's decision.

'I hope and pray that the 
commissioner will give me my day in court,' Charla Nash previously told reporters 
following a hearing in August before Claims Commissioner J. Paul Vance 
Jr.

Attack: On Feb. 16, 2009, the 200-pound chimpanzee named Travis, left, mauled Charla Nash, right, causing her to lose her eyesight, lips, nose, and hands in the attack

Happy: Nash, pictured with Travis, worked for the chimp's owner performing odd jobs and caring for the animal

'And I also pray that I hope this never happens to anyone else 
again. It is not nice.'

State Attorney General George 
Jepsen said the state shouldn't be held liable for the mauling.

He argued the judge should deny permission due to a law called the 'public duty doctrine'. It says the state has a duty to protect
the general public in regulatory matters, but not any individual who is
injured by another person not complying with regulations, the Hartford Courant reported.

Nash, who received a successful face transplant in 2011, reached a $4 million settlement 
last year with the estate of chimp owner Sandra Herold, who died in 
2010. She had sought $50 million.

The
settlement agreement filed in Stamford Probate Court calls for Herold's
estate to provide Nash with $3.4million in real estate, $331,000 in 
cash, $140,000 in machinery and equipment and $44,000 in vehicles.

Brenden
Leydon, a Stamford lawyer representing Herold's estate, had argued that 
it couldn't be sued because Nash was an employee of Herold 
and any claims were a worker's compensation matter.

Charla Nash now lives in a 
nursing home outside of Boston. She had gone to Herold's home on the day
of the attack to help lure Herold's 200-pound chimpanzee, Travis, back 
into her home.

But the animal went berserk and ripped off Nash's nose, lips, eyelids and hands before being shot to death by a police officer.

Travis had starred in TV commercials 
for Old Navy and Coca-Cola when he was younger and made an appearance on
the The Maury Povich Show.

The chimpanzee was the constant 
companion of the widowed Herold and was fed steak, lobster and ice 
cream. The chimp could eat at the table, drink wine from a stemmed 
glass, use the toilet and dress and bathe himself.

Bill Monaco before a hearing at the Legislative Office Building in 
Hartford, Connecticut last August. She was awarded $4 million in damages from the chimp's owner's estate

A month after the mauling, Nash's family sued Herold for alleged negligence and recklessness.

The lawsuit alleged Herold knew 
Travis was dangerous but failed to confine him to a secure area and 
allowed him to roam her property.

It also claimed Herold gave the chimp medication that exacerbated his 'violent propensities'.

Travis had previously bitten another 
woman's hand and tried to drag her into a car in 1996, bit a man's thumb
two years later and escaped from her home and roamed downtown Stamford 
for hours before being captured in 2003, according to the lawsuit.

Nash wants to sue the state 
Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, which she holds 
responsible for not seizing the animal before the attack despite a state
biologist's warning it was dangerous.
