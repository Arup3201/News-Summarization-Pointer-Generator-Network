He was one of 'The Few’ who took to the skies to protect their nation in the Battle of Britain.

Heroic Spitfire pilot Les ‘Ricky’ Ricalton was shot down and killed over Kent as his squadron intercepted scores of Nazi aircraft bound for London.

Now the Omega watch he was wearing at the time is up for auction – and it still shows the time when the brave serviceman died.

Spitfire pilot Les Ricalton, left, was killed at 3.40pm after being shot down over Kent in on October 17, 1940. Frozen in time, the Omega watch he was wearing, that was recovered from the crash site, still shows the exact time he died

The Flying Officer was just 26 when his Spitfire was gunned down near Hollingbourne in Kent at exactly 3.40pm.

Frozen in time having stopped ticking at that very moment, his watch is now expected to fetch as much as £4,000 when it goes under the hammer with other items including letters, photos, an identity card and a brass Spitfire model.

Mr Ricalton was born on January 21, 1914 in Hazelrigg, Northumberland and joined the RAF in 1938.

Other items going under the hammer at auction include the pilot's identity card, left, a brass model of a Spitfire, centre, and a number of photographs

Two years later, the German attack in the West was resulting in heavy losses within Battle squadrons.

In July 1940 Fighter Command sought volunteers from other commands to replace the losses incurred in France and Mr Ricalton bravelycame forward.

His squadron moved to Coltishall on September 9 and Ricalton engaged the enemy for the first time just days later.

On October 17, the same squadron was scrambled to intercept a high-level raid and 11 of their Spitfires climbed to 26,000 feet, keeping up-sun from a wave of German aircraft.

This image of Les Ricalton, pictured left while off duty with two friends, is also being auctioned. The items are expected to fetch up to £4,000

But within ten minutes, his Spitfire was seen falling from the sky.

The squadron’s Flight lieutenant ‘Sailor’ Malan reported: ‘Flying Officer Ricalton is missing, and I think he was killed, as I saw his Spitfire go down.

‘We must presume, from such a seasoned eyewitness, that the hits on Ricalton's Spitfire must have been quite decisive, either hits on the cockpit area or an explosion.’

He was buried in Sitingbourne, Kent with the inscription 'Ricky. He died for us' on the headstone.

The watch will be auctioned at Dreweatts Baldwin’s military sale in London next Thursday.
