As many as 30 Britons may now have died fighting for terror groups in Syria, it was reported last night. 

Researchers believe 24 jihadists have been killed fighting with Islamic State and other groups but think the true figure could be higher.

Hundreds, and possibly thousands, of Britons are believed to have fled to Syria and Iraq to join radical Islamic groups such as Islamic State (ISIS) and the Al Qaeda affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra.

But despite the deaths and the mounting political pressure on extremist groups both at home and abroad, there remains little consensus on how prevent radicalisation of more British nationals.

Shiraz Maher, of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, at King’s College London, told the Daily Telegraph death reports were rising but it was hard to verify exactly how many had died because of the difficulty of getting information from Syria.

He said: ‘The increasing reports of deaths will not dissuade people from going, because they regard it as martyrdom and a victory.

‘It is the ultimate prize for these jihadists and those around them celebrate their death.’

Raffaello Pantucci, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told the paper future converts may even be inspired by the killings.

'If you are going out there to fight and are motivated by the idea of jihad then you are not going to be put off by the deaths - some might even be inspired by them.'

Most recently, a teenager from Brighton, Ibrahim Kamara, 19, is believed to be among four radicalised Brits killed in an air strike in the Middle Eastern country last month.

A Foreign Office spokesman said last night: ‘We are aware of reports of the deaths of British Nationals in Syria.

‘The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, where all UK consular services are suspended.

‘As we do not have any representation in Syria, it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting British Nationals there are extremely limited.’

Ibrahim Kamara, also known as Khalil al-Britani, from Brighton, was reportedly killed in U.S. air strikes

Kamara, 19, ‘met the wrong people’ and was quickly radicalised, vowing never to return to Britain

Kamara, who called himself Khalil al-Britani, had recently completed a resit of his GCSEs at Varndean College in Brighton.

But the football-loving teenager ‘met the wrong people’ and was quickly radicalised. He is said to have recently vowed to a fellow fighter he would never return to Britain.

Following his death, his 35-year-old mother, Khadijah Kamara, said: ‘He called me in February. He said: “Mum, I’m in Syria”, and I hung up.

'He rang again and I said: “Don’t ever call me.” The first we heard about his death was when my younger son got a Facebook message from one of the boys he went out there with.

‘He sent a photo of Ibrahim dead and the message read “Congratulations, your brother has become a martyr”. My son told him to delete the picture but he refused.’

Kamara was a member of Jabhat al-Nusra, an Al Qaeda affiliate which has fought with, and sometimes against, Islamic State. The group has also fought against the forces of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in the country’s civil war. 

The Archbishop of Canterbury, Reverend Justin Welby, has warned against fuelling more extremism through the use of violence

The group were part of a 500-strong contingent of radicalised Britons who are believed to have made their way to the Middle East.

Although political pressure on the groups has escalated in recent months, there remains little consensus on how to prevent further radicalisation.

The Archbishop of Canterbury, Reverend Justin Welby, has said the use of force to stop the extremists can be justified in some instances but warned it also  fuels radicalisation.

Writing for Prospect Magazine, he said: 'Used only in the Levant (the eastern Mediterranean) and despite the involvement of five Islamic countries in the current US-led coalition, military force is inevitably seen as yet more “crusader” violence and increases support for what it seeks to subvert.'

He went on to criticise the 2003 Iraq War, led by George Bush and Tony Blair, for creating new networks of international terror and said violence should only be used when absolutely necessary.

'It needs to be integrated as a temporary aspect into the global response, playing a part in preventing groups such as ISIS or Boko Haram from changing the facts on the ground so drastically that all help to terrorised populations becomes impossible.'
