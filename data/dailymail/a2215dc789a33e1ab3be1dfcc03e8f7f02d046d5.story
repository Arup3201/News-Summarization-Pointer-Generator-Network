They sound like horrific chemicals you'd find in processed food.

But aspartic acid, isoleucine and ethyl butanoate are in fact found in a banana.

Likewise - did you know that when you eat an egg, you're eating glutamic acid, E160e and even formaldehyde?

Chemical world: One of the posters made by chemistry teachers James Kennedy to dispel the fear that has become associated with the word 'chemicals'

Mr Kennedy said: 'I wanted to show that chemistry isn't artificial and dangerous; but that chemistry is natural and everywhere'

The images below and their list of ingredients were made by James Kennedy, a high school chemistry teacher from Melbourne, Australia.

He says the aim of the project was to dispel the fear that has become associated with the word 'chemicals'.

He told MailOnline: 'As a high-school chemistry teacher, I made these posters for my students
 as a visual introduction to our Organic Chemistry course.

'I wanted to erode the fear that many people have of ‘chemicals’, and demonstrate that nature evolves compounds, mechanisms and structures far more complicated and unpredictable than anything we can produce in the lab.

'These posters aim to show that 
chemistry isn't artificial and dangerous; but that chemistry is natural 
and everywhere.

Lack of knowledge: Mr Kennedy and his students trawled medical literature to compile the lists of ingredients

'The chemistry of fun, friendly, everyday objects like 
bananas is more complicated and more fascinating than that of, say, a 
bomb.'

He added that chemistry has suffered in recent 
years from a negative image.

'Pesticides, poisons, drugs and explosives 
seem to dominate the public's perceptions of Chemistry while the other 
sciences bask in a much more positive light.

Mr Kennedy added: 'These posters prove that nature evolves compounds, mechanisms and structures far more complicated and unpredictable than anything we can produce in the lab'

'Mostly, this is because chemistry lacks a charismatic, public teacher 
like David Attenborough or Brian Cox, who currently inspire students 
into Biology and Physics, respectively. Chemistry only has Walter White 
from Breaking Bad, and he's done the industry a great disservice".

He added that all of the information was from reputable sources.

'The constituent ingredients were found on a nutritional analysis website; the color and preservative components were from old botany books; and the flavor compounds were found in published, peer-reviewed gas spectroscopy analyses of the volatile aromatic compounds in each fruit.
