The Mayor of Rome is furious that the British embassy has warned tourists of the rising threat of thieves on the streets of the Italian capital.

Ignazio Marino reacted angrily at the weekend to official warnings from the British government that alert visitors to evidence of worsening crime levels in Rome.

Mr Marino took aim at David Broomfield, the British consul-general in the city, who last week sought to alert tourists to the high risk of personal theft by ‘co-ordinated gangs’ on Rome’s public transport system and at the city’s top visitor attractions such as the Vatican.

Mr Broomfield urged British travellers to leave their valuables inside their hotel, claiming the gangs were a pervasive threat.

‘Visitors to Italy and especially to Rome should be aware of the high risk of personal theft, bag snatching, pick pocketing, that is endemic on public transport and at main tourist attractions in Rome,’ he notes on the British embassy’s official website.

But Mr Marino, Rome’s newly-elected mayor, strongly rejected the travel alert, saying Britain are guilty of scaremongering.

‘Rome does not deserve to be the victim of alarmism,’ Mr Marino said.

‘The incidence of petty crime in several European and American cities is much higher than in Rome. The capital is complex like many big cities but it is hospitable.’

In May this year Rome made international headlines in a tourist rip-off scandal after British tourists Roger Bannister, his brother Stephen and their wives Wendy and Joyce, from Stourbridge in the West Midlands, were charged €64 (£55) for four ice-creams they ordered on the last day of their holiday in Rome.

The incident triggered a debate in Italy about scams and rip-offs and now the threat of street crime has further damaged the city’s image.

Mr Broomfield said Italian media had noted the high level of criminal activity over the summer tourist season, often involving gangs which include children.
