The sons of Sir Lawrie Barratt have been accused of 'chucking out the peasants' by turfing women and children out of their homes on his former country estate to help settle a £20 million inheritance tax bill.

Sir Lawrie combined the role of go-getter tycoon with that of kindly 'squire' of the Daffodil Valley community of Farndale.

Under his patronage, the village - on one of the bleakest parts of the North York Moors - blossomed into a thriving community of artists, scholars, musicians, and writers.

'Kindly squire': Sir Lawrie Barratt, who died nine months ago, created a community of scholars, artists and writers at his vast estate in North Yorkshire

But, according to the Sunday Express, barely nine months after the building magnate's death, his legacy is starting to unravel as his heirs start evicting his former tenants and selling their tied cottages for big profits to help with their tax bill.

Locals say Sir Lawrie would be 'turning in his grave' if he had any inkling what his sons, Peter and David Barratt, had planned for the estate, which he built up from run-down farms and cottages from 1981.

Peter, a millionaire in his own right through his garden centre empire, and David stand to rake in big profits by selling properties rented for £600 a month for up to £380,000.

Worried tenants who have found out they have no legal protection are even turning to housing charity Shelter for help as they face homelessness.

Many of the properties were in a poor state before the Barratt frontman snapped up the estate for a reputed £1.5million as his regular retreat from the world of big business.

Tenants - who were often surprised by the modest terms on which Sir Lawrie offered the 300-year-old cottages - soon found that the businessman's word was his bond and were assured they had nothing to fear by investing in their homes.

Threatened: Homes on the Farndale estate are to be sold off after Sir Lawrie's death. He passed the portfolio to his sons Peter and David, who need to raise money to settle an inheritance tax bill

However, the tranquilllty of the Dale has been shattered after many of the tenants were informed Sir Lawrie's sons intended to begin selling some of the properties after each being stung for £10 million inheritance tax on their father's estate, valued at £48 million.

One elderly woman whose cottage is being sold from beneath her is said by neighbours to be bed-ridden with health problems.

Locals have also complained that David Barratt has also been sighted in the village eyeing up properties which are not even on the hit-list as a future second home for himself and his glamorous American girlfriend.

The residents who held mass meetings over the past week have agreed to launch a campaign to save Farndale at the Farndale Village Show tomorrow (Monday).

A petition is to be started and donations are already flooding in for a war chest to fund the legal costs of those who decide to stay to fight the eviction notices.

The first property to sell has been the cottage which Nicky Hollins and her ten-year-old daughter Ruby moved into six years ago.

When Sir Lawrie said yes without even running a credit check it was a dream come true for Nicky - who had been dreading bringing her child up in their home city of Hull.

But now the pretty white cottage has been sold subject to survey, ironically to her next door neighbours who are currently away in Africa, and she has to be out by October 17.

She said in the Sunday Express: 'Sir Lawrie kept this estate together and would not want to see the destruction of what he turned into a thriving community.

'The sons are chucking out the peasants. It is very feudal. They can do what they want I suppose but there should be some moral obligations on them as landlords.'

The Barratts own 48 farm houses in cottages in Farndale, about 45 per cent of the village - which nestles in the Yorkshire's own Daffodil Valley.

About 50,000 visitors a year flock to the beauty spot to admire the displays of unique flowers said to have planted centuries ago by local monks.

Nicky, 42, added: 'People love the Daffodil Walk because it is like stepping back in time and what makes it so authentic is people actually live here.'

Initially, 13 of the properties were to be put on the market. But after a storm of protest, this was reduced to seven.

However, the tenants believe the cottages will be sold one by one as holiday homes and the community wiped out.

The first to be evicted is self-employed artist Flo Watson who has to be out by September 29 along with her children Bella, 12, Minnie, eight, and Obie, four.

Her sister Chloe who lives next door with her three children has also been given her marching orders.

Flo was born and bred in the area, growing up in the next village, and moved onto the Dale three years ago.

'I felt very secure when I came here. It felt like I was coming home. If they had only given me six months' notice it would have been easier to deal with,' she said.

A Shelter spokesman said: 'We aren't able to comment on specific cases such as this, but Shelter's advice may be helpful to some of the residents in this case.'

A spokesman for Strutt & Parker, the estate agent acting for the sale of properties on the Farndale estate, said: 'Our clients are continuing to try to come up with options and solutions.

'The current situation is that only four occupied properties are going to be sold along with three vacant ones.'

Local Thirsk and Malton Tory MP Anne McIntosh called the situation 'difficult' and pledged to work to find a solutiuon.
