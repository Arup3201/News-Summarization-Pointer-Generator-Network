Italy's controversial debutant Eder saved his adopted country from a major embarrassment with a fantastic late strike to lift spirits ahead of their friendly against England on Tuesday.

Criticism aimed at Azzurri coach Antonio Conte for picking the Brazilian-born Eder – named by his football-loving parents after the 1982 Brazil World Cup star of the same name – was forgotten as the Sampdoria striker produced a brilliant finish after 84 minutes to preserve Italy's unbeaten record in Euro 2016 qualifying Group H.

Eder Citadin Martins, to give him his full title, turned brilliantly on the edge of the penalty area and hammered a right-foot curler that gave goalkeeper Nikolay Mihaylov no chance.

Ex-Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini, now in charge of Inter Milan, was among those who opposed his selection and said the Azzurri should only pick Italian-born players. Eder didn't move to Italy until he was 16.

His late equaliser saved Italy from a major humiliation in rain-soaked Sofia. Despite being gifted an early lead with an own goal, Conte's team then capitulated to trail 2-1 after 17 minutes against opponents who had only managed to beat Azerbaijan in their other four group games.

Even so, the Italian manager now faces an uncertain reception in Turin against Roy Hodgson's Three Lions with Juventus fans also blaming him for a knee injury to midfielder Claudio Marchisio sustained in Azzurri training on Friday.

Italian Football Federation President Carlo Tavecchio claimed on Saturday that death threats issued over the internet against Conte had left the manager “shaken” and angry. 

Conte left Juventus to replace Cesare Prandelli after last summer's World Cup and he rounded on his critics after Saturday night's draw by saying: 'I am Ok – but I don't forget. You can draw your own conclusions.

'In terms of the performance and the chances created, we deserved the victory. It’s a shame, as we achieved the bare minimum with the utmost effort in an arena that is traditionally difficult.

'I liked the lads, we dominated the game and they were restricted purely to counter-attacks.'

Bulgaria are a far cry from Hristo Stoichkov's side that reached the World Cup semi-finals in 1994.

And the match seemed to be going according to the formbook after four minutes when goalkeeper Mihaylov pushed a cross into the path of defender Yordan Minev who couldn't help it crossing the line for an own goal.

Without legendary goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon who was taken ill with flu shortly before the match, Italy's traditionally-strong rearguard was left all at sea.

Paris St Germain No1 Salvatore Sirigu didn't look a bad replacement but he had no chance with Bulgaria's equaliser after 11 minutes when Ivelin Popov took advantage of a back-pedalling defence to arrow in a low shot from 18 yards.

Incredibly, Bulgaria then quickly went ahead. Italian striker Simone Zaza carelessly lost the ball by the halfway line going for a mazy dribble and the home side counter-attacked at speed.

Georgi Milanov's pinpoint cross to the far post was aimed for Ilian Micanski and he got ahead of sluggish defender Andrea Barzagli to expertly headed in beyond Sirigu.

It was beyond the dreams of the Bulgarian fans, most of whom were getting thoroughly soaked by a torrential downpour. In fact, the National Stadium was only half-full because of low expectation among home fans but those who turned up were rewarded.

Conte sent on Eder for Zaza as a desperate measure to salvage a point – and it worked.

Italy, second in their group, are now firm favourites to qualify for Euro 2016 alongside leaders Croatia who they face in Zagreb in June.

Conte will definitely be without Marchisio for England's visit even though initial reports the midfielder suffered ligament damage look unfounded with medical tests showing nothing more serious than a sprain while Buffon will do his best to return from his illness.

The only Premier League player on show, Southampton striker Graziano Pelle, was an unused substitute for Italy but could face England and his Saints team-mate Nathaniel Clyne this week.
