Designer had sued High Street chain for copying his heels

French court rules customers will not be confused between designer version and cut-price pair and orders Louboutin to pay compensation

The distinctive scarlet soles have become an instantly recognisable marker of the brand, a stamp of taste and quality.

But Christian Louboutin’s red-bottomed
 shoes could face competition from high street lookalikes after a court 
ruled fashion chain Zara could sell heels in the same colour.

Louboutin initially sued  the Spanish 
brand in 2008, claiming that an open- toed red-soled shoe it was selling
 for £40 was similar to its Yo Yo style.

However a French court ruled that Zara’s cut-price shoe could not be confused with that made by the high-end designer.

And last week the Cour de Cassation – the final court of appeal – upheld the decision.

It also ruled that Louboutin, whose 
shoes are favoured by celebrities including Victoria Beckham and Sarah 
Jessica Parker and cost hundreds of pounds a pair, must pay the chain 
£2,000 in compensation.

Alexis Mourot, group chief operating 
officer and general manager of Christian Louboutin, said the company 
would continue defending its soles.

In 2008, Louboutin registered a 
trademark, claiming the exclusive right to make shoes with red soles for
 ‘women’s high fashion designer footwear’.

And last year the shoemaker accused 
designer Yves Saint Laurent of copying his celebrated red-soled 
footwear, when he used a similar theme in his 2011 resort collection.

That lawsuit resulted in a high-court appeal case in the US, the verdict of which is yet to be decided.

Earlier this year, Louboutin told 
 French newspaper Libération why the cause is important to him and his 
brand identity and that he is aware he cannot 'monopolise' a colour.

Seeing red: In April 2011 Christian Louboutin sued YSL for using red soles on the bottom of its red pumps, demanding $1million in damages

He said: 'I understand that, but it is a red in
 a specific context, there is Ferrari red [and] Hermès
 orange.

'Even in the food 
industry, Cadbury recently won a lawsuit against Nestlé for using purple
 packaging.

'All this proves that the colours play a part in a brand's 
identity. I'm not saying that red usually belongs to me - I repeat that 
this is about a precise red, used in a precise location.'

Louboutin said that he came up with the idea for his red sole heels, which are favoured by celebrities including Sarah Jessica Parker and Victoria Beckham, nearly 20 years ago, when he 
painted red nail polish on the black soles of a pair of women's shoes.

His lawsuit against YSL reads: 'Mr Louboutin is the first designer to 
develop the idea of having red soles on women's shoes.

'The location of 
the bright colour on the outsole of a woman’s pump is said to provide an
alluring 'flash of red' when a woman walks down the street, or on the 
red carpet of a special event.'

A spokesman for Zara declined to comment.
