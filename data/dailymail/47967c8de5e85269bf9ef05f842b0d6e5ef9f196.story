The so-called Plaxo co-founder who is charged with murdering his wife's new husband had never worked a day at the groundbreaking social network, founding executives reveal.

Minh Nguyen, 38, has spent years claiming he and Napster billionaire Sean Parker jointly founded Plaxo, which was later sold to Comcast for an estimated $170 million. 

As a supposed high flyer in the tech world, his arrest over the fatal shooting of his ex-wife's new husband on January 15 made national headlines.

But it has now emerged that Nguyen never set foot in the Plaxo building, was not present for any of the seminal discussions, and repeatedly edited the company's Wikipedia page listing himself as a co-founder - even though marketing directors kept correcting his changes.

His only connection to Plaxo, former executives told DailyMail.com, was that he went to school in Virginia with Sean Parker, who went to become the first president of Facebook.  

Lies? Minh Nguyen (left) who is charged with murdering Corey Mattison (right), new husband of his ex-wife Denise (also pictured right), claimed to be a co-founder of Plaxo - which former executives say is false

He also attended one of Parker's 'brainstorming' sessions before Plaxo was created, but was not present at any of the brainstorming sessions which led to Plaxo's inception. 

In fact, a former friend of Nguyen told DailyMail.com, the self-professed co-founder  left the tech business altogether to become a hairdresser during Plaxo's early years. 

John McCrea, former marketing director of Plaxo from 2006 to 2009, told DailyMail.com he never saw Nguyen. 

'Minh was a person that caused a fair bit of puzzlement for the company,' McCrea said.

'He was publicly making the claim of being a co-founder. We were aware of this through Wikipedia, which is a wonderful resource but comes with its own issues. 

'As the new head of marketing, soon after I joined I was curious to know who this person was.

'Socially, people told me no one knew why he made the claim. He wasn't there when Sean, Todd [Masonis] and Cameron [Ring] came up with the idea and developed the idea. He wasn't there when the company was finally formed. He never even set foot in the building. 

Turned a blind eye? Napster billionaire Sean Parker has not commented on the controversy as former executives of Plaxo reveal Nguyen, Parker's school friend, pretended to be a co-founder of the network

'According to his LinkedIn, Minh worked at Plaxo for ten months between 2001 and 2002, before the BETA version of Plaxo launched. There are no records of this and no one ever saw him there.'

McCrea said the company fought a constant battle, spanning years, trying to maintain the accuracy of their Wikipedia page.

'We went about correcting the false claim by editing it. But time and time again, a user by the name of Minh21 would go back in and change it inaccurately to say he was a co-founder. 

'That happened many times over multiple years. It became almost a joke.

'Eventually, after Plaxo was sold and many of us went on to our own start-ups or new firms, the importance of altering the Wikipedia page to accurately reflect history was not a priority. 

'We almost forgot all about it until this tragic story came out.' 

Speaking to DailyMail.com Todd Masonis, a founder of Plaxo who was with the company through its sale to Comcast, said that 'in my nine years working on Plaxo, [Nguyen] wasn't involved in any capacity beyond some initial discussions with Sean [Parker, another Plaxo founder] before the company was incorporated'.

Masonis, who is no longer with Plaxo, said Nguyen 'never met or worked with any of our employees, investors, or partners. I only met him socially two or three times. 

'Unfortunately, he appears to have overstated his connection to the company. This is a really tragic situation and our hearts go out to his family.' 

Although, he says, Nguyen may have discussed the idea with Parker, he did not develop the business model, meet the customers, meet the investors, work in the office, or work on its sale to Comcast.

Sean Parker, who left Plaxo in 2005, has so far declined to comment on the matter. 

Sources inside the company recall Parker brazenly handed shares to numerous people - including Nguyen - which created problems for the company and he later left.

A former friend, who spoke to DailyMail.com under the condition of anonymity, said Nguyen felt his ideas tabled in a brainstorming session were key elements of what Plaxo came to be.

The source said Nguyen claimed he fashioned design boards and paper prototypes. When Parker got serious about the idea, he enlisted the partnership of Todd Masonis and Cameron Ring - two Stanford co-founders - to work with and left Minh behind. 

'Over the years, while the Stanford co-founders were always annoyed by it and they all played the game of editing Wikipedia, it never seemed like Sean had a problem with Minh calling himself a co-founder - probably because he thought it was dumb and didn't care about it,' the source said.

Also, the edit history of Plaxo's Wikipedia page shows that as far back as 2006 a person identifying himself as Nguyen would edit the page to list himself as a founder any time he would be deleted.  

Denise Mattison told ABC that when her ex broke into her Virginia home last Thursday with a gun, her husband Corey lured him out of the back door and away from their children.

Minh Nguyen has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting dead his ex-wife's new husband  

Mrs Mattison said that her daughter, Madison, 14, and a younger sibling were able to escape and hide out in the bathroom to call the police.

Mrs Mattison, who married her late husband three months ago, told the network: 'He was my knight in shining armor... he literally laid his life down to save me.'

The couple lived together with their five children - Mrs Mattison's three children from her marriage to Nguyen and Mr Mattison's two children from a previous relationship. 

Nguyen was charged with first-degree murder on Tuesday.

He was arraigned on Tuesday and was held without bond. 

He is due back to court for a January 28 bond hearing. 

He allegedly shot dead Corey Mattison, a former minor league pitcher with the St. Louis Cardinals, after breaking into the newlyweds' townhouse in Ashburn, Virginia.

Two of Nguyen's three children with his ex-wife were present at the time of the shooting at 9.30pm last Thursday, police said. 

Denise walked in with her third child during the attack, according to a reported from the Londoun County Sheriff's Office.     

Nobody else was injured in the attack.

Nguyen was arrested without incident after being captured by his mother, who held him down and called the police, NBC reported. 

Officers found the mother and son struggling over his gun. 

He was charged with first-degree murder and is being held without bond. 

Mattison, who had two elementary-school-aged children of his own, was a project manager at a glass construction company based in Washington, D.C., WPBF reported. 

His colleagues told the station Mattison spent a lot of time with his children as well as Nguyen's.

'Corey and his wife would go to a baseball game with the kids, and [Nguyen] would blow up,' his colleague Rick Knutson said. 

'He would try to prevent them from taking the kids anywhere. The guy seemed to be a little unstable.'   

Nguyen, 38, allegedly broke into his ex-wife's home in Ashburn, Virginia, at 9.30pm and shot dead her husband

Court records from Nguyen's 2011 divorce do not indicate that he reaped any kind of lasting financial fortune from his association with the company.  

The documents said Nguyen was unemployed at the time and had been making less than $50,000 a year in the years leading up to the divorce decree.

Papers show that he was ordered to pay only $750 a month in child support for the couple's three children. 

Nguyen, graduated from George Mason University with a degree in Multimedia Design in 1997, and was based in Washington, D.C.

Having started out as an interface programmer at AOL, Nguyen's post-Plaxo career saw him take up advising roles at numerous apps and websites.

In 2012, he became the founding CEO of App Press, which provided tools for designers to build, manage and deploy apps.

He was then an advisor to for at least three tech firms and the chairman of the now-defunct Syllabuster, a mobile platform for students and teachers.
