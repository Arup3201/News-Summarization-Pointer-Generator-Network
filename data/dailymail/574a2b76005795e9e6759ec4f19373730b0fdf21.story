Britain and America will  hold 'war games' next week to test their response to the collapse of a major bank on either side of the Atlantic.

Chancellor George Osborne and Bank of England governor Mark Carney will join US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen in a Washington war room on Monday.

The simulated exercise will look at two scenarios – a major US bank with UK operations at risk and a major UK bank with US operations about to go under.

Regulators are desperate to avoid a repeat of the financial crash when the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered a crisis around the world.

This resulted in billions of pounds of taxpayers money being used to prop up stricken lenders including Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group.

Mr Osborne said: 'We are going to make sure that we can handle an institution that previously would have been regarded as too big to fail. We're confident that we now have choices that did not exist in the past,'

'London is a global financial centre, and is both home and host to some of the world's biggest and most important banks. This brings with it many opportunities for jobs and growth, but we need to make sure that taxpayers are not on the hook for future bank failures.

'That is why, in addition to the radical reforms to Britain's banking sector that we have already introduced, we also need to strengthen cross-border co-operation on this issue. The US is one of our most important partners, and I'm pleased to be taking part in this exercise in Washington next week.'

Six years after the financial crisis, experts are keen to prove they have created rules that will allow them to let a large bank go under without spending billions of taxpayers' money.

They have forced banks to ramp up equity and debt capital buffers to protect taxpayers against losses, and have told them to write plans that lay out how they can go through ordinary bankruptcy.

Salvaging a bank with operations in several countries - which is the norm for most of the world's largest banks such as Deutsche Bank, Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan - has proven to be a particularly thorny issue.

Two potential measures are expected to be announced this weekend, including banks having more long-term bonds that investors know can lose their value during a crisis, on top of their equity capital.

This would double their so-called Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity.

The second will through a change in derivative contracts, which in their current form protect investors, and complicate the winding down of a bank across borders.
