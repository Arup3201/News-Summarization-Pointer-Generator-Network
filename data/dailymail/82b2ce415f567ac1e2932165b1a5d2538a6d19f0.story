A remote snow town in Canada has made a decision to cancel trick-or-treating this Halloween in order to safeguard their children from polar bears.

An increasing number of bears have appeared around Arviat - a hamlet on the western shore of Hudson Bay in Nunavut - over the last few years, with a lack of sea ice forcing them ashore to find food.

This year the town have announced they will host an indoor alternative to trick-or-treating at a local community hall on October 31 'in order to prevent tragedy'.

There are about 2,300 people in the town, 1,300 of which are children.

Roaming around: Arviat resident Kristy Suluk took this photo of three polar bears looking for food outside her house on October 21. Trick or treating will be moved indoors in the town this year for safety reasons 

Remote: Of the 2,300 or so people in Arviat, Nunavut, about 1,300 are children, who will not trick-or-treat this year

'It was clear that the majority of people liked the idea of providing a safer environment for kids to celebrate Halloween,' officials said in a post on Facebook.

'The goal of this event will be to make sure our kids remain safe and still have fun.'

Arviat Senior Administrative Officer Steve England told CBC News that, being the middle of polar bear season, it was their only real option.

'It's a pretty obvious conclusion of what tragedies could come out of that,' he said.

'We're just trying to safeguard the younger population by offering an alternative.'

Moving indoors: A candy-filled haunted house will be built inside Arviat's Kalluak Hall as an alternative 

Remote: Arviat is a small town with a population of about 2,300 that sits on Hudson Bay in Canada's west

A haunted house will be constructed inside the community hall and there will be face painting.

Prizes and candy will also be handled.

There is talk about organizing a shuttle bus that will pick the children up and take their home.
