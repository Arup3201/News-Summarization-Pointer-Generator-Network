America's top military general said Tuesday that he is worried the ISIS terror army will soon seize the town of Kobane, a strategically critical Syrian site less than a mile from Turkey.

Gen. Martin Dempsey, who chairs the military Joint Chiefs of Staff, said 'I am fearful that Kobane will fall.'

Forces fighting for the self-declared Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham have pressed their way 'into the city itself,' he told ABC News. 'It may be about to fall.' 

And Dempsey said he has 'no doubt' that ISIS will inflict 'horrific atrocities' on any civilians still in the town 'if they have the opportunity to do so.'

The U.S. general said his counterparts in Turkey have assured him that they are gearing up to protect their territory if ISIS uses Kobane as a staging ground for an incursion to the north.

'They've got forces on their side of the border that will prevent ISIL from making any incursions into Turkey,' he said, using the Obama administration's preferred alternative name for the genocidal group. 

'But, of course,' he predicted, the terror army 'is smart enough not to do that.'

ISIS has engaged in a coordinated assault on Kobane for the past three weeks, driving countless Kurdish refugees out and killing an estimated 400-plus Syrian Kurds as it consolidated its gains.

If it should manage to take the city, ISIS would control most of the border region in northern Syria. 

American-led airstrikes, at least a dozen so far according to the Pentagon, have failed to prevent the terror group's advance, and Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday that Kobane was 'about to fall.'

The prospect that the town could be captured by Islamic
State, who are now within city limits, has increased pressure on
Turkey to join an international coalition to fight against the
jihadists.

Turkey is feeling pressure to finally join the international coalition battling ISIS now that the battle is on its doorstep. 

'It is our view,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday aboard Air Force One, 'that there is a clear interest that Turkey has in working with the international coalition – or international community – to deal with the threat that's posed by ISIL.' 

Dempsey said hours later that the U.S. and its allies were finding it more and more difficult to track the increasingly technologically adept ISIS forces.

'They're becoming more savvy with the use of electronic devices,' he said. 'They don't fly flags and move around in large convoys the way they did. ... They don't establish headquarters that are visible or identifiable.'

Retired Marine Gen. John Allen, President Obama's point man on anti-ISIS coalition building, was dispatched to Ankara on Tuesday to meet with Turkish officials, according to Earnest.

The White House, Earnest said, is 'very concerned about the safety of individuals – of citizens, of innocent civilians' in Kobane.

'We are seeing this extremist organization, in the name of an otherwise peaceful religion, Islam, perpetrating terrible acts of violence against religious and ethnic minorities,' Earnest said. 

'This is something that we remain concerned about.' 

Turkey said it was pressing Washington for more airstrikes,
although President  Erdogan said bombings by themselves would not be sufficient to
defeat ISIS. He set out Turkey's demands for
additional measures before his own country would intervene.

'The problem of ISIS ... cannot be solved
via air bombardment,' Erdogan said. 'Right now ... Kobane is about to fall.'

'We had warned the West. We wanted three things. No-fly
zone, a secure zone parallel to that, and the training of
moderate Syrian rebels,' he said.

Erdogan claimed Turkey would take action if there were threats to
Turkish soldiers guarding a historic site in Syria that Ankara
regards as its territory. But so far Turkey has made no move to
get involved in fighting across the border.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Turkish Prime
Minister Ahmet Davutoglu have spoken twice in recent days to
discuss the situation, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki
said.

'Turkey is determining what larger role they will play,' she said during a daily briefing.

'They have indicated their openness
to doing that, so there is an active conversation about that.'

U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said Turkey had been
generous in receiving refugees from Kobane but the international
community needed to protect the town. 

'What is needed now is
concrete action,' he said, without elaborating.

France said it was vital to stop Islamic State's advance on
Kobane, and was discussing with Turkey what could be done. 'A
tragedy is unfolding, and we must all react,' Foreign Minister
Laurent Fabius told parliament.

But some analysts doubt the will exists among Western allies
to take further action.

'It's the coalition of the unwilling, each country is doing
the bare minimum, particularly in Syria,' said Fadi Hakura at
the London-based think tank Chatham House.

From across the Turkish border, two Islamic State flags
could be seen flying over the eastern side of Kobani.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group
said it had documented 412 deaths of civilians and fighters
during the three-week battle for Kobane.

The U.S. military said it and allied air forces launched
strikes on Islamic State in Syria on Monday and Tuesday. In the
Kobane area the raids destroyed armed vehicles, a tank and a
vehicle carrying anti-aircraft artillery.

On the ground, a burning tank, apparently belonging to
Islamic State, could be seen on the western edge of town. There
were also clashes on the northern fringe and mortar explosions
could be heard to the northeast.

Close: Kobane is less than a mile from Turkey

Islamic State fighters were using heavy weapons and shells
to hit Kobane, senior Kurdish official Asya Abdullah told
Reuters from inside the town, estimated by the U.N. on Tuesday
to contain possibly a few hundred remaining residents. 

Islamic State, an al Qaeda offshoot, has ramped up its
offensive in recent days against the mainly Kurdish border town,
despite being targeted by U.S.-led coalition air strikes aimed
at halting its progress.

'There were clashes overnight. Not heavy, but ISIS is going
forward from the southwest. They have crossed into Kobane and
control some buildings in the city there,' said Rami
Abdulrahman, head of the Observatory, a group that monitors the
conflict with a network on the ground. ISIS is a former name for
Islamic State.

'They are about 50 meters (55 yards) inside the southwest of
the city,' Abdulrahman said.

An estimated 180,000 people have fled into Turkey from the
Kobane region following the Islamic State advance. 

More than
2,000 Syrian Kurds including women and children were evacuated
from the town after the latest fighting, a member of the Kurdish
Democratic Union Party (PYD) said on Monday.

Before the offensive, Kobane, known as Ayn al-Arab in
Arabic, was home to refugees from the civil war that pits rebels
against President Bashar al-Assad and has deteriorated into
hundreds of localized battles between different factions.
