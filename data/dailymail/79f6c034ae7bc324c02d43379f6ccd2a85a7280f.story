A woman who tried to video conference with her colleagues was left red-faced after she accidentally called them while she was naked.

The Australian in her mid-20s shared her story via social media site Reddit under the user name swallowing_panda.

She claimed she worked for 'a corporate job at a big firm' and the incident happened on Wednesday morning, while she was working from home.

An Australian woman (not pictured) claims she accidentally video called her colleagues naked while working from home

On the day she decided to work from home, she also decided not to wear clothes.

'There's lots of perks working from home, one being that clothes are optional,' she wrote.

'I set up my laptop and sit it in front of my naked body.'

The corporate worker explained she then went to boot up a new program that allowed her to take calls on her computer from her office phone.

As it was the first time she had used it, she chose to test it out - with awkward results.

'I first call my mobile from the program and all works great. I then proceed to call my boss [45 year old awkward male] from my laptop,' swallowing_panda said.

The woman, only known as redditor swallowing_panda, said the incident happened on Wednesday morning (above is a stock picture)

'And, like a baby boomer using Skype for the first time, lean up close to the mic to test the audio: "Hi Boss! Just testing the new program out! Hows everything going?"'

swallowing_panda said she was puzzled when her boss did not respond and heard only background noises for 10 seconds before he hung up.

She then goes on to call a colleague who she describes as a 'mid-30s nerd-like male'.

But his reaction was as confusing as the first after she asked her workmate if he could hear her.

'A stumble of words come out from my mic, I hear a faint gasp, a laugh and then after a few seconds he too hangs up,' swallowing_panda said.

She is on the cusp of giving up when she receives a call from another colleague named Patricia.

'I answer with a "Hi Patricia!". There's a long pause. I lean in further to my screen, boobs perked above the keyboard, "Patricia, I'm working from home today, can you hear me?"' swallowing_panda wrote.

'I hear a "oh my God" then she too..hangs up. Things are getting weird.'

Thirty seconds later, swallowing_panda finally gets an explanation for her colleagues' bizarre behaviour.

'I receive an email from Patricia: "swallowing_panda, sweetie, put some clothes on". I want to die,' she said.
