As menus go, it sounds more like a gruesome task from I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! than something you would choose to eat.

But bugs of all types including grasshoppers and worms will be served at Britain's first insect restaurant when it opens this summer.

Grub Kitchen in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, South Wales, will be the UK's first to focus entirely on insect produce, according to trade magazine The Caterer yesterday.

Head chef Andrew Holcroft told The Caterer: 'We want to pioneer the movement to normalise the eating of bugs on a day-to-day basis.'

'We are treating them as a normal food item, incorporating insect protein as an ingredient but using normal flavours we are familiar with and everyday food items we recognise.

'I am a firm believer that people are not going to stop eating meat -- that goes against biology -- so bugs are also going to sit next to normal dishes on the menu.

'For example, we are serving both bug burgers and lamb kebabs.

It will be part of Dr Benyon's Bug Farm, where Mr Holcroft's partner Dr Sarah Kenyon will run insect workshops.

Along with cooking demonstrations and interactive tasting events at Grub Kitchen, the pair hope to raise awareness of the environmental and health benefits surrounding entomophagy. 

Mexican food chain Wahaca sold 1,500 plates a week of its fried-cricket special during a month-long trial throughout January. 

Marketing manager Oli Ingham said: ' The experiment has been a great step in the right direction and hopefully one that will change our food map for ever. We hope we have inspired other restaurants to do the same thing. '

Entomophagy – the human consumption of insects – seems to be getting more popular. Mexican chain Wahaca is selling a dish with crickets at its Covent Garden branch this month and next.
