Argentinian tenor Marcelo Zelada was left red-faced after he forgot the words to Australia's national anthem while he was singing it at a Rugby Union Championships match.

The singer could only remember the first line of Advance Australia Fair in full before he stumble his way through the rest of the song, much to the amusement of the Wallabies.

Zelada was singing in the city of Mendoza before the Australian side took on Argentina's home side, the Pumas, at Estadio Malvinas Argentinas on Sunday.

The singer boldly continued but was only able to get a spattering of words correct and mumbled gibberish in place of the ones he did not remember before some of the Wallabies started to realise Zelada's shortcomings.

The team push on singing the tune proudly but not without suppressing their laughter at the situation.

Video footage shows the moment players - including Israel Folau and Adam Ashley Cooper - try unsuccessfully to hide their amusement. 

At the end of the song, one of the commentators said: 'Well, that's an interesting take on Advance Australia Fair.'

But the team continued to proudly sing the tune despite the oversight by the singer

His colleague replied: 'My favourite [version] ever.' 

The stuff-up was not a good omen for the Wallabies who were trounced by the home side by three points.

It was Argentina's historic first win when they beat the third-best team in the four-nation championships 20-17.
