A former Tampa police officer was denied bail today and will remain in jail until his trial in the shooting death of a husband and father in a Florida cinema.

The bail hearing for Curtis Reeves, 71, who shot Chad Oulson, 43, after an argument over texting on January 13, took a dramatic turn when prosecutors played a grainy video of the shooting and a recording of the defendant's police interview.

Judge Pat Siracusa watched the video of the shooting and heard interviews with witnesses before making his decision to keep Reeves in jail until his trial for second-degree murder.

Denied: Reeves will stay in prison until he goes on trial for fatally shooting Chad Oulson, 43, and wounding his wife, Nicole, 33, during an argument January 13 over texting at the Cobb Grove 16 theater in Wesley Chapel, Florida

The judge heard a recording of he former cop telling detectives that he should never have shot Oulson.

'As soon as I pulled the trigger, I said, "Oh, this is stupid," Reeves told police. 'There's no justification for what happened in there. If I had to do it over again, it would have never happened. We would have moved.'

The court also heard that Reeves' wife Vivian
 Reeves told detectives that Oulson used expletives, but didn't 
make any threats to her husband. She cried during the interview and said she didn't 
know why her husband fired the single shot.

'He was in law enforcement 20 years, and he never shot anybody,' she said. 'He's never threatened anybody with a gun.'

Reeves did not react when the judge announced his decision. His attorneys say they will appeal.

Judge Siracusa urged the court to remain calm as he announced his decision.

'I’ve
 been doing this long enough that no matter what I say in the next five 
minutes, there are going to be a lot of people who are going to be 
unhappy,' he said.

'And
 it’s when you’re initially unhappy you’re tempted to say or do 
something that you wouldn’t normally do. There’s probably not a better 
illustration of that than what brings us here today.'

Oulson's
 widow, Nicole Oulson, looked relieved and sat with her eyes closed for a
 moment as the judge spoke. Later, she spoke to reporters.

'I'm just very happy and relieved by the judge's ruling,' she said. Nicole Oulson was struck in the hand by the bullet that killed her husband.

According to the police interview, Reeves said Oulson hit him in the face, possibly with a cellphone, and he shot in self-defense. Yet other witnesses, including Reeves' wife, told authorities they never saw Oulson strike Reeves.

Chad and Nicole Oulson were watching the previews before the movie 'Lone Survivor' at a Wesley Chapel theater when, according to authorities, Reeves became annoyed with Chad Oulson using his cellphone.

Reeves, who was with his wife Vivian, went to complain about Oulson to the movie theater managers and when he returned, the argument escalated.

The video shown in court today appears to show Reeves leaning over his seat repeatedly, telling Oulson to stop texting on his cellphone.

Oulson appears to throw popcorn at Reeves, then shows Reeves sit down and remain seated after shooting Oulson.

Reeves' defense argued that the apparent flashes seen, however, were from Chad Oulson's cell phone and not gunshots.

Vivian Reeves did tell police that Oulson stood up and leaned over toward her husband just before the shooting, and the video appears to show some sort of contact between the two men.

Defense attorney Richard Escobar seized on those inconsistencies during his closing arguments to the judge and said the witnesses in the theater were 'all over the place' and that the people who saw Oulson die in the theater that day 'want to do everything they can' to help Oulson in the courtroom.

Escobar argued that Reeves should be released on bail because he is a decorated, retired police captain who has deep ties to the community.

Reeves pleaded not guilty. If convicted, he could face a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years in prison.

Prosecutor Manny Garcia argued that Reeves should remain in jail without bail.

'Pointing the gun, firing the gun, and his statements constitute second-degree murder,' Garcia said. 'If he left the firearm in the car, we wouldn't be here today.'

Prosecutors also played a recording of a police interview with Nicole Oulson.

'He kept saying stuff to my husband,' Oulson said of Reeves. She said she didn't immediately realize her husband had been shot.

'Immediately it didn't even register with me, I just saw a spark and saw him go down,' Oulson said.

She said after the shooting, Reeves 'just sat in his chair, he just kind of leaned back and just sat there, didn't try to help.'

'As all the chaos was going on, he was just sitting there,' she said.

Authorities said Reeves became upset when Oulson was texting during the previews before the matinee. The Oulsons were sitting in front of Reeves and his wife.

Witnesses said they didn't see Oulson hit Reeves, but some saw popcorn flying toward him.

'This happened so damn fast,' Reeves told Detective Allen Proctor in the recording. Reeves also said a woman with Oulson, later identified as Nicole Oulson, was 'holding' her husband back. The same bullet that struck Chad Oulson struck Nicole in the ring finger.

Reeves was charged with aggravated battery charge in that injury.

The bond hearing began Wednesday. Judge Pat Siracusa heard from Reeves' family, friends and former colleagues who testified he didn't have any anger problems and would not be a flight risk.

Reeves told the detective that Oulson hit him in the face and that his glasses became crooked. Reeves said to the deputy that he might have been hit with a cellphone, but prosecutors disputed that suggestion.

'It scared the hell out of me,' said Reeves, adding that had he been younger, he would have 'wrassled' Oulson to the ground. 'The guy was very aggressive.'

In an interview this week on ABC's 'The View,' Nicole Oulson said her husband was texting with their daughter's baby sitter.

Reeves 'had confronted my husband several times, which my husband ignored and ignored and ignored. And it just got to a point where my husband spoke up,' she said.
