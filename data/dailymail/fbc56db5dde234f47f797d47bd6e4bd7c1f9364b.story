Literary giant Joan Didion has revealed that she had 'no idea' her recent foray into modeling for high-end French label Céline would be the focus of such a huge amount of social media interest.

Speaking to the New York Times from her Upper East Side residence, which is where her stark portrait for the Spring 2015 campaign was taken, the 80-year-old author admitted she was surprised to hear what a stir the new ads had caused.

'I have no clue,' she said of the excitement surrounding the campaign, which was shot by photographer Juergen Teller. 'I have no idea.'

The renowned writer also added that she has never before attended a Céline show, although she would 'love to' in the future, but that she is indeed a fan of the brand and owns 'a few' of their pricey pieces, although she declined to specify which items exactly.

Describing Ms Didion as being 'as crisp as one of Phoebe Philo’s cotton tunics', the New York Times' Alexandra Jacobs added that fashion's newest darling was quick to remind her that the Céline campaign is not her first job as a model. 

'Ms. Didion also reminded this reporter that this is not the first time she has acted as a model,' Ms Jacobs wrote.

'Besides the famous cover image of her peering out of her Corvette for her memoir “Where I Was From" - to which Céline paid apparent homage with earlier shots of their usual model, Daria Werbowy - she appeared in a 1991 ad for the Gap.'

Following its official launch on Tuesday afternoon, interest in the striking Céline campaign quickly reached fever pitch on social media, with tens of thousands of fashion and literature fans taking to Twitter and Instagram to share their excitement at Ms Didion's starring role.

The minimalist portrait, which is typical of Céline's preferred aesthetic, sees the American writer and long-time style icon pose in a pair of statement sunglasses wearing a navy sweater and a gold pendant.

Ms Didion - who suffers from multiple sclerosis and is said to be in frail health - is based in New York City and is currently the subject of a documentary about her life, We Tell Ourselves Stories In Order to Live, being filmed by her nephew, filmmaker Griffin Dunne.

Described by Vogue as being perhaps 'the ultimate Céline woman', she has always shrugged off the notion that she is a fashion icon.

In her 1979 autobiographical book The White Album, she famously described her sartorial uniform as comprising of merely 'two skirts, two jerseys or leotards and one sweater.'

Still, Ms Didion found fame as a Vogue copywriter in the late 50s, which must have rubbed off on her, and her effortless-chic style has been idolized  ever since.

Céline's decision - overseen by the label's creative director Phoebe Philo - to cast her as its latest muse is a testament to this. 

Ms Didion spent most of her long-spanning career as a journalist, essayist and novelist living in California with her husband John Gregory Dunne, a fellow writer she married in 1964.

Tragedy struck, however, when John died suddenly of a heart attack in 2003, leaving Ms Didion a widow after almost 40 years of marriage.

Less than two years later, the couple's only daughter Quintana Roo Dunne died at the age of only 39 after a series of illnesses culminating in a fatal bout of acute pancreatitis.

Some theorize Quintana's death was a result of her acknowledged alcoholism, although this was never mentioned by family members.

Ms Didion subsequently wrote two memoirs which dealt with her grieving process; A Year of Magical Thinking in 2005 and Blue Nights in 2011.

In July 2013, she was awarded with a National Medal of Arts and Humanity by President Barack Obama.
