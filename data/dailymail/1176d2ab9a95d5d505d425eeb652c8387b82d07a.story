Former EastEnders actor Kiruna Stamell, who has dwarfism, took legal action against the Post Office because she could not reach their chip-and-pin machines

A former Eastenders actress with dwarfism will no longer struggle to reach chip-and-pin machines at the Post Office after suing the company for disability discrimination.

Kiruna Stamell, who appeared on Albert Square as well as in Moulin Rouge!, launched legal action after she was 'humiliated' in a branch.

The 33-year-old actress said she found branches inaccessible for someone her size as she could not reach card machines that were fixed to the top of the counter.

On one occasion Ms Stammel said she and other customers had to wait while staff built makeshift steps out of cardboard boxes so she could put in her pin.

The Post Office settled with her and has now brought in devices that can be handed to customers in hundreds of branches across Britain.

Ms Stamell, who is just over a metre tall, told the BBC: 'It was really embarrassing, because there was a very large queue of people behind me.

'I just wanted to be able to put my pin in like everybody else and post a letter and to withdraw cash, and I wasn't able to reach the machine and it wasn't able to be passed to me.

'So staff were improvising random steps out of cardboard boxes, and it was really quite humiliating.'

Ms Stamell, who played a minor role in EastEnders and starred alongside Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in 2001 film Moulin Rouge!, claimed for disability discrimination because of the Post Office's failure to make adjustments to their machines so she and other people her height could use them.

'The design was less flexible than in other shops. In places like Boots, Tesco and my bank the pin machines are held in a holster. They also have a broader range of movement because they are on a flexible tether, so can be handed to the customer,' she explained.

'When I shop most places, I am usually handed the pin machine by shop staff, so I can privately enter my pin.

'Unfortunately, I had several negative experiences at post office counters and for many years I have had difficulty paying for their goods and services. After a couple of really upsetting experiences at various branches, I realised, something needed to change.'

Mark Davies, the Post Office's communications director, said he would encourage customers who are unhappy to let staff know so improvements could be made.

He said: 'We are absolutely going to listen to them and I think, as in the case with Kiruna, we've listened to the points that she's raised with us, we've taken action.'

A spokeswoman for the Post Office added: 'We want to make it as easy as possible for the millions of people who visit our branches each week to access our services. We listen to our customers and are pleased to be making the improvements needed following the concerns raised by Kiruna Stammell.

'As a result we are now introducing these changes to pin pads in the over 300 of our biggest branches in high streets and city centre. Pin pads are being adapted by introducing a flex which allows them to be removed from their holder.

'In addition as part of a wider modernisation programme we are making it easier to access services, through new improved low level counters in thousands of branches and also over 1,000 branches now have flexible pin pads.'
