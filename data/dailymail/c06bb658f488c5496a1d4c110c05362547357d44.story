She is well regarded as one of the most influential reformers in the middle east so it came as no surprise to those watching the world leaders flock to New York this week to see Queen Rania of Jordan arrive at her hotel in the city.

Her arrival provides a temporary distraction from the week long debate over whether President Obama will meet with Iranian President Rouhani in what would be the first time in more than 30 years that leaders of their respective countries would come face-to-face.

The Queen cut business-like fugure in a smart cream-coloured pencil skirt and blazer as she was spotted arriving yesterday ahead of the United Nations General Assembly which officially opens tomorrow.

In keeping with her reputation as one of the world's most stylish royals her business attire was perked up with a pair of killer heels and the new Louis Vuitton Monogram tote bag.

Combining a tan cuir calfskin leather body with the designer's iconic brown monogram canvas sides the beautiful bag retails for around £2,300.

Queen Rania has been closely involved in humanitarian work in Jordan since her husband Abdullah bin Al-Hussein assended the throne in 1999. 

The following year she was asked by the United Nation's Children's Fund to join Global Leadership Initiative.

She also joined the United Nations Foundation Board of Directors in 2006 and became honorary chairperson for the United Nations Girls' Education Initiative in 2009.

It remains to be seen what role the Jordanian delegates will have in the General Assembly talks which are set to be dominated by discussions about Syria.

Jordan has repeatedly try to distance itself from the civil war in its neighbouring country by refusing to get involved in the conflict.

The country's diplomatic stance has been characterised by uncertainty and hesitation which differs greatly from the popular perspective, which is mostly in full support of the Syrian revolution and in favour of the departure of Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad.

The nation has faced considerable problems however as a result of the tide of refugees that has flooded across its borders in a bid to escape the fighting.

After accepting 520,000 Syrians earlier this month Jordanian officals closed their frontier in an attempt to stem the flow which has seen the national population has rise by 8 per cent in two years.

The exodus has placed immense strain on resources and Jordan's government wants to halt the inflow until new camps are ready.

The biggest existing facility, Zaatari, houses 120,000 refugees and UNHCR is now building another camp for 130,000.

Queen Rania's arrival in New York comes just ahead of Obama's scheduled address to the United Nations General Assembly which is due to take place later this morning.

It is expected the President will take the opportunity to call on UN Security Council members to approve a resolution that would mandate consequences for Syria if it fails to cooperate with a plan to turn its chemical weapons stockpiles over to the international community.

The president's address will be closely watched for signs that he may meet later in the day with Iranian President Hasan Rouhani, a moderate cleric who has been making friendly gestures toward the U.S. in recent weeks.

Even a brief encounter would be significant given that the leaders of the U.S. and Iran haven't had face-to-face contact in more than 30 years.

U.S. officials say no meeting is planned, though they hadn't ruled out the possibility that one might be added. The most likely opportunity appeared to be at a U.N. leaders' lunch Tuesday.

Rouhani himself is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly later this afternoon.

The possibility of a thaw in relations with Iran was expected to factor heavily in Obama's address to the U.N.

In a preview of the president's speech, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Obama would discuss 'our openness to diplomacy and the prospect for a peaceful resolution of this issue that allows Iran to rejoin the community of nations should they come in line with their international obligations and demonstrate that their nuclear program is peaceful.'

American officials say Rouhani's change in tone is driven by the Iranian public's frustration with crippling economic sanctions levied by the U.S.

But it is still unclear whether Iran is willing to take the steps the U.S. is seeking in order to ease the sanctions, including curbing uranium enrichment and shutting down the Fordo underground nuclear facility.
