Already known as the ‘happy slam’ in tennis, the Australian Open is now planning to be the biggest one as well, and some Disney magic this year will also make it an occasion for all the family.

Tennis Australia plans to expand the tournament site in Melbourne to Federation Square. The multi-million dollar expansion would dwarf that of rival grand slams at Wimbledon, and the French and US Opens.

But this is just the beginning. The Herald Sun reported that Tennis Australia is also seeking the green light from Melbourne City Council to create an entertainment precinct that would run from Federation Square along the banks of the Yarra past Birrarung Marr Park to Batman Avenue.

And fairy tales will not be restricted to the court this year either as Disney is making its debut at the event.

To attract families over the tournament’s final week of play when the secondary stadium at Melbourne Park - the 10,500 seating Hisense Arena – is empty, it will be transformed into a mini-Disneyland theme park and movies like the blockbuster Frozen, Big Hero 6 and The Lion King will be shown.

One of the tournament’s major drawcards 20-year-old Eugenie Bouchard of Canada is also very popular with teenage fans, and it’s hoped that the combination of both will keep children and teenagers happy over the course of the event.

The new entertainment zone would be temporary and removed at the end of the tournament each year before being set up again the following season. Plans for a new pedestrian footbridge to connect Melbourne’s CBD with its famous sporting precinct as part of a $348 million upgrade will help facilitate this.

‘Once the bridge is open it will create a clear and legible pedestrian route straight to the heart of the city from Melbourne Park which can incorporate entertainment facilities here,’ a spokesman for Major Projects Victoria said.

‘The new bridge creates an opportunity for entertainment facilities to be put in this area. It creates a great chance to capitalise on this opportunity.’

Eugenie Bouchard, 20, of Canada will be a big hit with the event's teenage fans who will also get to experience Disneyland this year too

The zone would free to the public and feature a variety of entertainment such as live music, gourmet dining, children’s play areas, and bars. 

Tennis Australia has already approached the local council and is hopeful the project will be approved in time for the 2016 tournament.

TA’s commercial director Richard Heaselgrave told the Herald Sun that talks with Melbourne City Council would resume as soon as this year’s tournament finishes.

'The vision is to take the entertainment we already have and put rocket fuel into it,' he said.

'We have the ability to double our site and that’s our plan. We are an entertainment festival and we want to make it more accessible to more people.'

Mr Heaselgrave said tournament chiefs also wanted to expand the tennis festival from two to three weeks and believed their objectives 'aligned' with those of Lord Mayor Robert Doyle.

'It’s free, it’s entertainment, it involves the population of Melbourne and incoming tourists - you can tick all of those boxes,’’ he said.

'The vision is entertainment, some tennis, some food and wine, some kids entertainment, some music.

Mr Heaselgrave said the Open was about more than just tennis.

He said that although it was still a great grand slam event, it could do much more as an entertainment vehicle.

He said the entertainment zone 'would certainly not be devoid of tennis with plans ranging from many partner-inspired tennis activations to an idea for a special practice court on the banks of the Yarra.'

Heaselgrave said increased entertainment was integral to the Open’s future.

Melbourne Park is regarded as the most modern and functional of the four grand slam events.

It has three major courts equipped with retractable roofs after the completion of the $366 million first phase redevelopment.

The event is aiming to break attendance and commercial records this year with a target of 700,000 spectators over the next two weeks if the weather remains good.
