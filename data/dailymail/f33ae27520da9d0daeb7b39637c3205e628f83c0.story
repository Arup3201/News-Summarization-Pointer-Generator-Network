A French adventurer who trekked across Canada has vanished in the Alaskan wilderness - leaving behind his kayak, food, several maps and a personal journal.

Francois Guenot, 32, dubbed 'the crazy Frenchman', went missing as he explored the wild land of the four-million-acre Katmai National Park last month. 

His red-and-white kayak was discovered on a beach along Shelikof Strait off Cape Douglas, around 200 miles south-west of Anchorage, last week.

Mystery: Francois Guenot was last seen in Kohanok on the Alaska Peninsula and planned to kayak hundreds of miles to Perryville. Remains found on Shuhak Island in September have been identified as his body

It contained his identification, food and maps, as well as an array of personal journals, according to rangers at the park, which is home to Alaskan brown bears.

'We've picked up nothing more,' chief park ranger Neal Labrie told the Associated Press yesterday. 'And the last journal entry he had among his goods was dated June 15.

'There is really no reason why he would 
have left all his personal belongings, especially his ID behind.'

Mr Guenot, who worked as a ski instructor in Maiche France, arrived in Lake Iliamna in south-west Alaska last autumn after spending more than two years trekking across Canada.

He is believed to have made his way to Kokhanok - a small community on the south shore of Iliamna Lake - before leaving on May 6 with the intention of travelling to Perryville, according to the Anchorage Daily News.

He was last seen on May 26 squatting in a cabin at Amakdedori Creek, around 40 miles west of Kamishak Bay,

Mr Labrie said a search for Mr Guenot - carried out by park rangers, the U.S. Coastguard and eventually Alaska State Troopers - had been suspended on Saturday following the discovery of his possessions, with aerial searches also failing to locate his whereabouts.

'Had there been anybody or anything to see along those coastal areas, we probably would have seen them,' Mr Labrie said.

He added that if Mr Guenot had decided to abandon his kayak and walk, the search area could be 'endless', since his possible route was not known.

Park ranger Wendy Artz said the adventurer could be anywhere between Kokhanak and Chignik, a small fishing community around 250 miles to the south-west. 

She added that the land between the two villages in home to more bears than people, while the waters of Cape Douglas - where Mr Guenot's possessions were found - are notoriously dangerous

Mr Guenot arrived in Canada in the summer of 2011 to begin his trek across North America, which included several misadventures, including falling into a river in the winter. 

He eventually made his way to Fairbanks, where he found a bike at the dump and rode it to Homer, before venturing to Seldovia, where he found two kayaks and made them into one seaworthy vessel.

In
 January
 2012, he told Yukon News that he dreamed of adventure in the wilds of Canada and Alaska,
 saying: 'I don't want to stay like a dog on a leash in France.'

After showing up in south-west Alaska, Mr Guenot befriended Kokhanok resident Gary Nielsen and lived on his property in a tent.

When it was too cold to sleep outside, Mr Nielsen said the explorer - who earned his nickname based on his ultimate goal to reach the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia - would sleep in a steam bath. 

He added that Mr Guenot had set off in May, telling him that he was going to Perryville, but had seemed to have trouble comprehending the great distances involved in travelling Alaska.

Earlier this year, the adventurer had spent three weeks walking around Lake Iliamna during spring break up, but somehow came back in one piece, he said.

Meanwhile, another of Mr Guenot's friends, Jim Tilley of Intricate Bay, said many locals were concerned about him, telling the Daily News: 'He was just aloof to the dangers of Alaska.'

Mr Neilsen said Mr Guenot had been planning to meet up with friends on July 19 when he vanished.

'If we hear nothing by the end of July, he's probably dead,' he added.
