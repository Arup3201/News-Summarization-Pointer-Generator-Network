In tough times, some of us will go to any lengths to get a free lunch.

And that includes Hazel the red squirrel who is seen here taking the aerial route to collect some hazelnuts at the country park she calls home.

Soaring through the air, she aims for park ranger Victoria Sissons’s  arm, and, on making a safe landing, scampers along her sleeve to pilfer her pockets.

Red squirrels can jump up to 20ft through tree canopies when they spot food, which helps explain why  Hazel appears to be sailing through the air.

As for the pickpocketing, it’s a trick she has learned because rangers at Escot park, in East Devon, carry nuts with them especially for the eight red squirrels who live in an enclosure there.

The squirrels have even started pickpocketing visitors – although it’s unclear how many snacks they’ve managed to get their paws on. Rangers have excused Hazel’s behaviour because they believe she is pregnant and gathering food ahead of giving birth.

Red squirrels are extinct in Devon but John-Michael Kennaway, whose family has owned the estate for 200 years, has helped to establish a small conservation area for them on his land and hopes to one day release them into the wild near Land’s End.

Phew: Landing complete, cheeky Hazel prepares to hunt for nuts in the ranger's pockets

Getting warm: Hazel peeks inside Ms Sissons's pockets before finding the nuts carried to feed the eight red squirrels who live in the enclosure at Escot park in East Devon.

Red squirrels are a protected species 
in Britain, brought to the brink of extinction by their disease-carrying
grey cousins. Outside the Lake District and Northumbria, the few 
remaining reds live in colonies on Anglesey, the Isle of Wight, Brownsea
Island in Poole, Thetford Chase in East Anglia, Cannock Chase in 
Staffordshire, Hope Forest in Derbyshire and Merseyside’s Formby Point 
nature reserve. They are still widespread in Scotland.

Hazel
was born in 2011, in the enclosure at Escot, which is surrounded by 
20ft of sheet metal to keep out grey squirrels. She breeds with her 
partner Big Red.

Mr Kennaway
said: ‘Hazel is the matriarchal type and was one of the first squirrels
here, so she is also one of the braver ones.

‘All
the squirrels here are used to humans and really tame. They know all 
the keepers and will happily forage in their pockets for food.

‘They even have a check in visitors’ pockets despite us not encouraging them to feed the squirrels.’
