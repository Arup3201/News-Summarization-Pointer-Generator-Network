A 19-year-old UC Berkeley student who went missing after leaving an alcohol-fueled frat party over the weekend called a friend in the early hours of Saturday telling her he was 'screwed' and that he got lost, it was revealed today.

Eloi Vasquez, an economics major and star soccer player at the prestigious school, was last seen at 1.30am Saturday leaving a spring break celebration held by the University of South California's Tau Kappa Epsilon. 

Now unreachable, he is the subject of a large-scale police search. Eloi's family are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to his safe return.

Last seen: He was last seen leaving a party held by the University of South California's Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity in the early hours of Saturday morning. The star soccer player has no money or ID, police say

His cousin Logan Crespan (left) told DailyMail.com he said he was going to the beach, which is 15 miles away

His cousin Logan Crespan told DailyMail.com: 'He said he was going to the beach when he left the party but the closest beach was 15 miles away.' 

Eloi's mother, Wendy Margolin, said that at around 2.20am her son called a friend, Aurora, Cardenas, and told her he was 'screwed' and that he did not know where he was.

'He pretty much said, "I need you to come over here, I need help." I asked him, "Where are you?" and he told me that he was in LA and that he didn’t know where he was at and that he was lost,' Cardenas told NBC Bay Area. 'The second time he called it just clicked. I didn’t know if his phone died, or if he hung up.'

Addressing the media Sunday, Ms Margolin said her son is very responsible and dedicated to his studies, and that it was it out of character for him not to contact his family and friends. 

The 19-year-old's parents drove to Los Angeles from Northern California Saturday to join the search for their son. Margolin was planning to scour doughnut and candy shops that are open late in the area of the frat house.

Meanwhile, his friends have been visiting lifeguard towers in Santa Monica and Venice Beach.

 A missing poster describes Vasquez as a six-foot, 175lb Hispanic man with dark hair and brown eyes. 

He was wearing a white and red t-shirt, white plimsolls, and gray chinos at the party on the  600 block of W 28th Street, a fraternity hub known locally as 'Greek Row'. Vasquez is not a member of a fraternity.

Relatives told police he did not have any money or identification with him at the time. He did have a cell phone on him, but it appears to have died. 

Cal Athletics released a statement Sunday addressing Vasquez's disappearance.

'Eloi is a wonderful young man who has excelled both academically and athletically here at Cal,' the press release said. 'Our entire Cal Athletics family is very concerned for Eloi’s safety and our first priority is to help in any way we can to locate him.'

Vasquez, born in Novato, California, is an accomplished soccer player who trained at France's esteemed Racing Club Strasbourg Alsace and the youth academy of Pachuca in Mexico.

Appeal: Friends, relatives and teammates are sharing this missing poster in a bid to track him down

Getting the word out: Friends have described him as a 'really special kid' in Twitter appeals

He has also played for the California Golden Bears.

A fellow player, Matthew Powell, tweeted a picture of Vasquez with the caption: 'My former teammate, Eloi Vasquez, is missing...last seen at USC. Really special kid, keep spreading the word.' 

In a statement, his university said: 'Eloi is a wonderful young man who has excelled both academically and athletically here at Cal. Our entire Cal Athletics family is very concerned for Eloi's safety.'
