A teenager used his grandfather’s war bayonet to slaughter a lamb before trying to cook it on a campfire in front of his shocked friend, a court heard.

Alex Sleigh, 18, stabbed the animal in the chest before carrying it back to the group of campers who called police.

Burnley Crown Court heard how the teenager told police he had intended hunting and killing for his own pleasure and said it would have been more fun if the animal had 'put up more of a struggle'.

Officers then found a cache of weapons under Sleigh’s bed and recovered some 'concerning' documents from his home.

Natalia Cornwall, prosecuting, said Sleigh was camping in March this year in Rivington, Lancashire, with a group of about 20 youths.

She told the court how Sleigh left the group and returned carrying a dead lamb. When asked where he had got it from, the court heard he replied: 'I have just killed it'.

He told the group he did it because he was hungry and then cut off one leg, put it on a skewer and tried to cook it, before throwing it away complaining it wasn't cooking.

Some of the group were unhappy and called the police who discovered a knife in his bag and a large bayonet-style knife covered in blood.

Sleigh, who has no previous convictions, told the police he had not killed any animals before but had thought of hunting for a while.

Andy Pilkington, defending, said: 'They are concerning offences, to say the least. He has not done it with the intention of killing an animal for any sadistic purposes.'

Sleigh, said by a judge to have a 'worrying interest in weaponry and explosives', was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome after the incident and has had treatment.

He admitted possessing a bladed article and causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.

The teenager, from Blackrod, Bolton, was given a two-year supervision order and was banned from owning or keeping animals for five years.

Mr Pilkington said the offences were the catalyst for Sleigh, currently on a work placement in catering, being diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome.

Sentencing Sleigh, Judge Simon Newell, who had read medical reports from two psychiatrists, told him: 'Both doctors take the view you are not a significant risk to the general public, but there are concerns as a result of Asperger’s as to your future and possible future criminality.'

The judge added he hoped funding could be made available for specialist treatment for Sleigh.

He said: 'We hope this is one-off behaviour. I am sure it is. I hope that with the support of your family and the probation service you can put in place around you such structures as will help you lead a law abiding life in the future.'
