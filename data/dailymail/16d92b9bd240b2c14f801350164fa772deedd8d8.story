Brenda Leyland was accused of trolling Madeleine McCann's parents on Twitter

An inquest into the death of a woman accused of trolling Madeleine McCann's parents has been adjourned after a post-mortem examination yesterday failed to establish a cause of death.

An inquest at Leicester Coroner's Court was told the post-mortem examination conducted yesterday had failed to establish the cause of 63-year-old Brenda Leyland's death.

A few days earlier she had been confronted by Sky News reporter Martin Brunt about trolling the McCanns on Twitter.

During the exchange, Mrs Leyland initially refused to speak but then replied: ‘I’m entitled to do that.’

Opening the inquest, Leicester Coroner Catherine Mason was told there was no evidence of foul play or third party involvement in the death.

Police Sergeant Kevin Taylor told the coroner he was informed that Mrs Leyland was dead after being sent to the Marriott Hotel in Enderby.

The officer said: 'At the scene I was joined by another officer and a county ambulance first responder unit.

'I was then informed by the paramedic and the other officer that there was a deceased female within the room.'

Sgt Taylor added that officers were awaiting the results of additional post-mortem tests and were still undertaking inquiries into the death.

Adjourning the inquest until December 18, Mrs Mason said: 'It's quite clear from the evidence before me that I am not in a position to conclude (the inquest) today.

'The cause of death is still not known and police inquiries are rightly ongoing.

'Therefore, with the sergeant still tasked to complete the police inquiries and the pathologist still to provide a cause of death, I am adjourning the inquest.'

Officers from Leicestershire Police, who are not treating the death as suspicious, were alerted to the discovery of Ms Leyland's body at 1.42pm on Saturday. 

Mrs Leyland, from Burton Overy, Leicestershire, is reported to have posted thousands of messages on Twitter attacking the McCanns, whose daughter Madeleine disappeared in Portugal in 2007.

The 63-year-old tweeted that she ‘hated’ Kate and Gerry McCann and launched online diatribes about their behaviour in the aftermath of their daughter’s disappearance.

But unlike other ‘internet trolls’, she did not appear to have made threats against the couple.

Ofcom received 60 complaints about the Sky News report, which did not name Mrs Leyland but referred to her by her Twitter name @sweepyface.

A spokesman for the broadcasting regulator said: ‘It’s important to stress that we’ve not reached a view as to whether an investigation will take place.’

Sky News said in a statement: ‘We were saddened to hear of the death of Brenda Leyland. It would be inappropriate to speculate or comment further at this time.'
