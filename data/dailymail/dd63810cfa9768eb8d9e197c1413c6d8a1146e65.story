A 'beer card' has been created which allows punters to purchase their favourite tipple at a discount.

The pre-paid beer credit card has been produced by German brewers Kolsch and allows drinkers to buy 22 glasses of the beverage for just 25 Euros - or £19. 

Manager Alex Strieder, 29, said: 'We wanted to create something that would reach similar cult status to the football club season ticket.

'That is what gave us the idea of the typical Kolsch glass as a symbol. 

'This led on to the pubs and the idea to save some money with the use of a card.

'If customers are loyal to us, we'll be loyal to them and keep prices down.

'It's safer than using cash too. Who would mug someone for a glass of beer?' 

Drinkers can top up their card with credit before a night out and use it instead of cash or credit cards at pubs that have signed up to the scheme.

Petra Zemljic, 53, a landlady in Cologne, western Germany, said: 'We're delighted with the idea.

'Anything that makes the drinking environment easier and smoother is good for us and good for customers.

Drinker Dennis Mahler, 23, also welcomed the initiative. He said: 'All I have to bring is one little card. It means cheaper beer and I don't have to remember my wallet.
