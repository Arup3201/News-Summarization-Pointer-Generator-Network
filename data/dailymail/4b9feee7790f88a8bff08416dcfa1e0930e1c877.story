 A 17-year-old girl who was forced to undergo chemotherapy testified Monday at a closed door hearing where she and her mother are seeking her release from state custody. 

Cassandra Fortin testified by teleconference in Juvenile Court, according to attorneys.

The teen learned recently that her cancer is in remission and she is no longer fighting the treatment. But she and her mother are asking to end her custody by the Department of Children and Families (DCF) so she can go home now instead of waiting until the chemotherapy is complete next month.

Mrs Fortin, pictured, said she was behind her daguter's decision to not undergo cancer treatment.  

Michael Taylor, an attorney for the teen's mother, Jackie Fortin, said if the judge will not lift the temporary custody order, they would like for the teen at least to be able to visit with her mother at the hospital. Ms Fortinh said DCF has prohibited her from having contact with her mother.

'We'd like to end the whole thing,' Taylor said, according to The Hartford Courant, during a break in the hearing, 'but if we can't, we want to do as much as we can for her. She wants to be with her mother.'

Ms Fortin remains confined at Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford. She will be free to make her own medical decisions when she turns 18 in September.

After Ms Fortin was diagnosed with high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma in September, she and her mother missed several appointments, prompting doctors to notify the DCF, court documents say.

Hodgkins lymphoma (cells pictured) is a disease of the white blood cells 

Hodgkin's Lymphoma is cancer of the white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body.

The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.

Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands.

These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.

The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.

It usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50.

The cause is unknown but risk factors include medical conditiona that weakens your immune system, taking immunosuppressant medication and being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (which causes glandular fever).

It isn't thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it.

The only way to confirm a diagnosis of HL is by carrying out a biopsy.

Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent.

Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids. 

A trial court in November granted DCF temporary custody of Ms Fortin. Lawyers for Cassandra and her mother then sought an injunction prohibiting medical treatment but failed.

The case went to the state Supreme Court, which ruled in January that the state wasn't violating Ms Fortin's rights by forcing her to undergo chemotherapy.

The case centered on the mature minor doctrine recognised by several other states — whether 16- and 17-year-olds are mature enough to make their own medical decisions.

Ms Fortin told People.com that she did not want to undergo chemotherapy and that when she was taken into care the state tried to prevent her mother from paying a visit. 

She said the hospital even posted a guard outside her door because they feared that she would try to escape. 

On the day before her chemotherapy, hospital staff were forced to restrain her before they could administer an anaesthetic. 

She said: 'When a nurse came in and I told myself just to fight. When she started to put an IV in me, I wouldn’t let her.' 

Ms Fortin spent two hours arguing with a doctor trying to convince them to suspend her treatment.

'Security had to pick me up, pin me to the bed and strap me down by my wrists and ankles, When I woke up, I looked down and there was a port in my chest. I thought, 'I cannot believe they did this to me.'

'I felt violated. I felt like I was being treated like an animal. I thought, "How can you force a person, regardless of how old they are, to do something they haven’t given consent to?'"' 

In a statement to ABC News, Connecticut's DCF said:  'When experts -- such as the several physicians involved in this case -- tell us with certainty that a child will die as a result of leaving a decision up to a parent, then the Department has a responsibility to take action. Even if the decision might result in criticism, we have an obligation to protect the life of the child when there is consensus among the medical experts that action is required. 

'Much of the improvements in Connecticut's child welfare system have come from working with families voluntarily to realise solutions to family challenges. 

'Unfortunately that can't happen in every situation, especially when the life of a child is at stake.'
