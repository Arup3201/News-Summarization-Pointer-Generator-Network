The multi-million battle for Amanda Knox’s story is hotting up as publishers and television networks fight for the world-famous American student who was cleared of murder to sign on the dotted line.

Knox, 24, hired the same literary agent as Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Elton John to negotiate a deal - and publishing executives are reportedly ‘falling in love with her’ as she meets with them.

Meanwhile Knox, who successfully appealed a conviction last autumn over the murder of Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Italy, was spotted cycling in her hometown of Seattle, Washington, on Sunday.

‘I think it’s a huge gamble for somebody,’ one publisher who does not expect to bid on Knox’s book told the New York Times. ‘It’s not like she has been exonerated in a clear and definitive way.’

Knox has previously said she wants to be a writer. Her story is even more world-famous than that of Casey Anthony, 25, who was cleared of murdering her toddler daughter in Florida last year.

Former University of Washington student Knox spent almost four years in prison abroad but has said little about what happened in public - and that’s what publishers want to get out of her now.

But some publishers are concerned that a seven-figure advance might not be worth it - and there are only a select few who could take that kind of risk on Knox, reported the New York Times.

The value of her story has been compared to that of Jaycee Dugard, who was kidnapped and held captive for almost two decades. She had a book published last July that has sold 1.2million copies.

Meanwhile Knox’s ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, who also had his conviction overturned last October, has a literary agent and ghost-writer in Seattle, reported the New York Times.

‘I’m honoured to work with this fine young man and let the world know the real Raffaele,’ said Sharlene Martin, a literary agent in Seattle. ‘A sensitive, compassionate and heartfelt person.’

Knox herself acquired Washington lawyer Robert Barnett to represent her in a book deal and networks are stepping over each other to get the first interview since her release from prison.

‘The world has heard from everybody else,’ one publishing executive who is interested in bidding told the New York Times. ‘But the world has not actually heard from Amanda Knox.’

Last week lawyers for Knox asked an appeals court in Italy to overturn her slander conviction as well, but it was not clear when the court would issue a ruling.

It stems from statements she made to police in 2007 that falsely implicated bar owner Patrick Lumumba in the murder of Ms Kercher, 21. She told a court later on that police pressured her.

Ivorian drifter Rudy Guede is now the only person convicted in the killing. Kercher's body was found, with more than 40 stab wounds and a deep gash in her throat, in the flat she shared with Knox.

Knox’s family say they have spent more than $1million in legal, travel and living costs to be near her during the murder trial. Experts estimate they may have spent even more on her appeal.

Knox wrote so many journals in jail that an extra suitcase was needed to take them back to the U.S.
