Hannah Patmore, 14, has been found to be suffering from polymorphic seizure disorder for 12 years. She is pictured with her mother

Doctors have decoded a teenage girl's genetic make up to help reveal what is causing the violent seizures her parents fear could prove fatal.

Hannah Patmore, 14, began suffering epileptic fits when she was two years old.

For more than a decade doctors have tried to diagnose the teenager's condition to help find a treatment.

Specialists now believe they have had a breakthrough, after analysing Hannah's parents' genes.

By examining their DNA, experts discovered Hannah suffers a mutation of the SCN2A gene.

The condition, which is thought to affect less than 100 children in the UK, means sodium channels in the brain are broken and electric impulses are unable to travel down the nerves, causing epileptic fits.

Her family hope the discovery could pave the way for a treatment that could change her life.

Ms Patmore’s mother, Alison, 45, a self-employed businesswoman from Whitley Bay, said: ‘Up until the age of two-and-a-half she had no seizures but then she had severe convulsions.

‘A week later they were just coming faster and stronger and that’s when we went to hospital.

‘Dr Rob Forsyth started working on Hannah’s case and for the past 11 years he’s been helping us.

The neurologist works at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary.

Mrs Patmore said: ‘We’ve been through various medications and the seizures have been quite bad in the past.

'There have been nasty seizures where she’s crashed to the ground and had stitches and lost teeth.

‘We are in the earliest stages of the diagnosis but we’re so grateful for the work of Dr Forsyth and his team.’

Ms Patmore, from Wallsend in North Tyneside, needs round-the-clock care and has problems with communications after also being diagnosed with pervasive development delay.

Her family, including her father Simon Patmore, 49 and her brother James, 16, live in fear Hannah's condition could prove fatal.

'You live knowing Hannah could have an epileptic fit and fall and that would be her last'

‘It’s terrifying when Hannah has a fit and it always will be - you live knowing Hannah could have an epileptic fit and fall and that would be her last. There’s always that fear but that’s the role of a parent,’ Mrs Patmore said.

‘We’ve got incredible support and genetic tests have been coming along for some time.

‘These medics are working with so many people they are able to change people’s lives. They are fabulous neurologists, we couldn’t be in better hands.

‘We are so grateful, our family, and our 
external family. We can work anywhere in the country but we couldn’t get
 the same support we get here in Newcastle.

'Hannah is an absolute star. I’ve never met such a resilient child who bounces back from everything - this last year she’s been so happy as an individual.’

Hannah Patmore's mother Alison said: ‘It’s terrifying when Hannah has a fit

People diagnosed with the disorder have severe epileptic fits and seizures.

Patients typically suffer fits before their first birthday.

Seizures often occur in clusters for prolonged periods of time and children often have learning difficulties.

The condition is thought to affect less than 100 children in the UK.

Polymorphic Seizure Disorder is cause by broken sodium channels in the brain that mean electric impulses are unable to travel down the nerves - causing fits.

Scientists have now found that Hannah has a genetic mutation of the SCN2A gene.

There is currently no medicine to effectively treat or control the condition.

Dr Forsyth is trying to raise funds that could help unlock the science behind childhood brain diseases including meningitis, epilepsy and mitochondrial diseases.

Some of the illnesses encountered by Dr Forsyth and his team are so rare they have not yet been medically identified.

He warned that there is a still a ‘great distance’ between diagnosing Ms Patmore’s condition and developing the correct medication.

He said: ‘We’ve known for many years that Hannah clearly has learning problems and bad epilepsy and this is an example of how medical science in this area has been moving forward.

‘We are understanding more and more about epilepsy in children.

'Hannah’s epilepsy is an example of the kind of condition that we in the medical community had not really identified but we are now recognising and finding more often.’
