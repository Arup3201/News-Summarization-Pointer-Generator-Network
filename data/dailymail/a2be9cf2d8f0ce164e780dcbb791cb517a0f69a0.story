Katarzyna Gacek, who has been jailed for 20 months for perverting the course of justice over the death of her son, seven week-old Thomas

A young mother who was accused of killing her baby has escaped the blame for his violent death after she concocted a 'pack of lies' with her boyfriend and landlord to cover it up.

Katarzyna Gacek, 24, of Oldham, Greater Manchester, was charged after seven week-old son Thomas died in hospital having been admitted with multiple injuries consistent with being squeezed beaten and shaken.

But although she, her boyfriend Darren Butterfield, 35, and landlord Dawid Mokrzanowski, 26, all lied about the circumstances leading up to the youngster’s death, all escaped culpability for the tragedy after a legal technicality meant it was impossible to prove who caused the baby’s injuries.

Initially, the trio had all signed a statement falsely claiming Thomas was injured accidentally when Gacek slipped and dropped him on a flight of stairs before falling on top of him.

But CCTV showed Gacek out shopping on the day of her son’s death - leaving him at home with her landlord who subsequently said the baby had injured himself accidentally in his cradle.

It was then claimed Gacek had waited ten hours before taking her fatally injured son to hospital while she and Mokrzanowski researched head injury symptoms on Google as Butterfield looked on.

Medical evidence later showed the fatal injury was inflicted on Thomas closer to the time of his admission to hospital.

At Preston Crown Court, Gacek, Butterfield and Mokrzanowski had all faced trial accused of allowing or causing the death of a baby but a judge halted the case after ruling it could not be proved who caused the injuries to Thomas - or when they were caused.

Gacek's boyfriend Darren Butterfield and landlord Dawid Mokrzanowski were also sentenced to 20 months

He ordered jurors to return not guilty verdicts on all three and also ordered them to acquit Mokrzanowski on a separate charge of manslaughter.

All were instead jailed for 20 months each for perverting the course of justice by providing the false statement. The verdicts meant the truth behind little Thomas’ death may now remain a mystery.

Gacek had originally been charged with murder.

Earlier the jury was told Gacek had moved to the UK from her native Poland in 2010 but had no contact with Thomas’s father Michal Szarek, 36, who was initially unaware the child was his.

Mokrzanowski, 26, lived with Gacek and Thomas and often acted as carer for her son, as did Butterfield, a frequent visitor to the address.

Tragedy struck just a week after Thomas was examined by a health visitor on January 17 and was found to be a healthy, growing baby with no medical problems.

On January 25 he was admitted to Royal Oldham Hospital with multiple bruises all over his body, severe retinal bleeding in both eyes and was noted to be pale, unresponsive and having a seizure.

He was transferred to Manchester Children’s Hospital but was pronounced dead two days later. Tests showed he had 22 bruises four broken ribs and bleeding on the brain.

Initially when Gacek took Thomas to hospital she told nurses she had been alone in the house with Thomas all day and was carrying him up the stairs when she slipped on a rug and dropped him.

She claimed she was unable to stop herself falling on top of the baby and causing him severe injuries.

But staff at the hospital suspected serious non-accidental injury and contacted police. Gacek Butterfield and Mokrzanowski agreed to sign statements verifying her account of what happened.

But officers investigated further and CCTV captured her visiting Oldham town centre on her own January 25 leaving Thomas at home.

Butterfield was captured on cameras boarding a bus and arriving at the house at 2pm - seven hours earlier than he originally stated. All three later admitted their initial account was false and accepted Gacek was not alone with Thomas and did not fall while carrying him.

Mokrzanowski later told police he had been in the house between 9am and 1pm but had been unaware he was supposed to be caring for Thomas until he heard him crying.

He then brought the baby downstairs and placed him in a plastic rocking cradle and rocked him to sleep.

Gacek then returned to find her son had a cut and bruise to his lip and confronted Mokrzanowski who claimed he too fell asleep himself and the boy must have accidentally banged his mouth on the frame of his rocking cradle.

Butterfield said the group sat on a sofa and using Google to research and the read out ‘brain concussion of a child symptoms’ and ‘baby staring in one place.’

During the trial prosecutor Raymond Wigglesworth QC said the jury was entitled to ask whey they had told 'a pack of lies' and added: 'Why did the three defendants agree to lie about what happened to Thomas?

'Was it because they feared the Social Services coming in asking questions or was there some other motive for shielding the truth from the hospital staff and police?

'We know at some stage someone within that household unlawfully caused injury to Thomas either by striking him or squeezing him, causing four fractures to the ribs on the left side of his body.'

He said Thomas’s body was examined by a number of medical experts including a consultant paediatrician who concluded the number of bruises - 25 different sites - were 'suggestive of inflicted injuries and are not consistent with accidental injuries to a non-mobile baby'.

He added: 'In particular she noted that the injuries to both ears were unusual and would suggest either an impact with a hard surface or that he had been slapped across the face.'

The post-mortem examination also revealed that Thomas had four fractured ribs said to have been caused in the days before he suffered the fatal head injury.

Mr Wigglesworth said the expert view was that the most probable cause was non-accidental and the amount of force required would be 'considerable, even on a baby of this age'.

After the case David Lees Crown Advocate for CPS North West said: 'On 26th January 2014, a seven week-old baby boy was admitted to Royal Oldham Hospital with head injuries, where he tragically died the next evening.

'Following an investigation by Greater Manchester Police a senior crown prosecutor conducted a thorough review of the evidence.

'A decision was made that the baby’s mother Katarzyna Gacek and her partner Darren Butterfield should be prosecuted for causing or allowing the death of a child, and their landlord Dawid Mokrzanowski prosecuted for manslaughter.

'The case proceeded to trial at Preston Crown Court and commenced on 9th July 2014.

'As the trial progressed it became apparent that the medical evidence was now suggesting that the fatal injury was inflicted much later in the day than previously thought and closer to the time of the baby’s admission to hospital.

'As a result we could no longer prove to the very high criminal standard who was responsible for inflicting that injury, nor that Ms Gacek and Mr Butterfield by either act or omission had caused or allowed the death to occur.'

Senior Investigating Officer Duncan Thorpe from the Major Incident Team said: 'Gacek, Mokrzanowski and Butterfield all colluded together to hide the truth of what really happened to baby Thomas that night. He had been subjected to abusive head trauma caused by violent shaking and suffered a number of other injuries including fractured ribs.

'This has been a very sad and difficult investigation for all those involved.'

In a statement, Thomas’ family said: 'As a family we are all truly devastated and deeply shocked by the tragedy we have all suffered and the loss of our little baby boy.'
