Gone: Long Island nursing student Jasmine Joseph, 22, was last heard from on the evening of February 24

As far as her parents were concerned, 22-year-old Jasmine Joseph was a straight-A student studying hard to become a nurse.

But it was not until the young Long Island woman vanished more than a week ago that her family discovered the truth: Jasmine Joseph had not seen the inside of a classroom at the New York Institute of Technology since May of last year.  

The Syosset resident went missing February 24 after calling her mother at around 5pm to tell her that she was studying in the library at the Old Westbury campus.

Police later determined that Jasmine Joseph was in a Syosset gym when she placed the call to her mother.

The 22-year-old never made it home that night, and her parents' calls later started going straight to voicemail.

On Wednesday, Jasmine's father made an emotional plea asking his daughter to come home.  

'Please come back,' Sony Joseph tearfully told the station PIX11. 'Your papa and mom are waiting for you. We don’t ask you anything.'

Truth revealed: Jasmine's parents, Sony and Lovely Joseph, have learned from police that their daughter had not attended classes since last May

Web of lies: Jasmine told her mother over the phone that she was studying at the college library, but it was later determined that the 22-year-old was calling from a gym

Jasmine, whose brother is away in medical school, has been living with her parents in Syosset while pretending to attend classes at NYIT.

A statement from her parents' American Express showed that the young woman used the credit card to pay her $6,000 tuition for the fall semester.

However, investigators have uncovered that Miss Joseph was last seen on campus in the spring of 2013.

'That's not her character,’ said her mother, Lovely Joseph. ‘She always obeys.'

Mrs Joseph noted that there had been a few warning signs, including the fact that that her daughter was no longer bringing text books home.

But the 22-year-old explained that she was doing her coursework online.

The parents became even more concerned when Jasmine, who had been a straight-A student, failed to bring a report card this winter.

‘When her father asked to see the report card, she said there was something wrong with the computer,' said Mrs Joseph, a registered  nurse with the North Shore-LIJ Health System.

On the night of Jasmine's disappearance, the parents went to search for her on campus, believing that someone had kidnapped her. They found no sign of the 22-year-old or her silver Nissan.

Investigators, however, do not think that Jasmine, who is legally an adult, was the victim of foul play.

The woman's father, a technician with the New York Transit Authority, insisted that his daughter – whom he decribed as being ‘always happy’ - had no reason to run away because she was free to come and go as she pleased, and was not subjected to strict rules.

When asked if the college junior may have been upset about a boyfriend, Sony Joseph stated that his daughter was not in a relationship with anyone.

Friends, family and volunteers have spent the past week distributing 'missing' flyers and raising awareness of Jasmine's disappearance through a Facebook page.

Kompassist Missing Persons Network also set up an online fundraiser on Fundly.com to finance the search efforts.

Joseph is 5-foot-4 and weighing 120lbs with brown eyes and black hair. She was last seen wearing white and black sneakers, black jeans and a green sweater.

Contesting theories: Police are convinced that the missing woman was not the victim of foul play, but her parents are certain that she would not have take off on her on
