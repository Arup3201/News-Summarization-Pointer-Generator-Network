A Minnesota mother claims a faulty background check which labels her a murderer has ruined her reputation.

Lorie Wosmek is suing The McDowell Agency and her local district after she was let go as a school's volunteer and made to feel a social pariah.

The mother-of-two said that her life changed for the worse in the fall of 2012 when she agreed to a background check after years helping out  at Remer School District, even coaching one of their football teams.

Fired: Lorie Wosmek was not allowed to volunteer at Remer School District because a wrong background check identified her as a murderer

'Parents acted strange,' said Wosmek to CBS. 'People who said 'hi' to me before wouldn't say 'hi' anymore.

Wosmek was suddenly told she could no longer work around children and the district said that they would let her know why she was being dumped in a letter.

It arrived with a copy of her background check which showed up a woman with the same name, but wildly different past.

'All I saw on there was homicide,' said Wosmek. I burst into tears.

False: This is the background check returned on Lorie Wosmek that ruined her life as a volunteer

Help: Wosmek once worked as a coach in the Remer School District and enjoyed her time as a volunteer

According to the wrong background check, Wosmek was supposed to have committed vehicular homicide.

However, Wosmek had never committed or been convicted of this crime and tried to tell the district and the background check company,.

She alleges the false check was passed around other school district's in the area for five months - which stopped her getting more work.

The district denies this allegation.

Denials: The Remer School District has said that it does not recognize any of Lorie Wosmek's claims

Wosmek says despite the error being recognized she has not been welcomed back. Again, the district denies not offering her more work as a volunteer.

'When people hear good news like 'she didn't commit the crime,' they don't tend to spread that around,' said Wosmek to CBS.

The McDowell Agency, which is in St. Paul has admitted in court filings that their check was a mistake.

A spokesperson told CBS, 'We believe the evidence will support our position that Ms. Wosmek's reputation was not impacted or harmed by anything we did.'
