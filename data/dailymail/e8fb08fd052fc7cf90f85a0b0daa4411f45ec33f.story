When the owner of a battered old teapot took it to be valued by TV antique experts, they estimated it at £120.

But if he felt disappointed, it will not have been for long, for it went on to sell for £2,200 as part of a collection that fetched an even more impressive total of £140,000.

The anonymous owner had taken the silver teapot to a valuation day for the BBC show Flog It!, where further investigation by the auctioneers Henry Aldridge & Son was suggested.

Discovery: Flog It presenter Paul Martin with the battered teapot, which along with five other items fetched £140,000 at auction

Silverware: Valued at £120, the historical teapot fetched £2,050 at the auction, part of a record-breaking haul which made £140,000

High value: Two Tibetan deity figurines made £77,000 and £45,000 at the auction

They discovered the pot was part of a 
precious collection of antiques brought back from Tibet by the Wiltshire
man’s grandfather.

He had taken part in a notorious 
expedition to the country led by Colonel Francis Younghusband in 1903, 
the first time British explorers had been granted access to Tibet.

Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said: ‘Our 
ears pricked up immediately, because some years ago we sold some items 
from that expedition and they went for a lot of money.

‘We asked the chap if he had anything else, and we couldn’t believe it when he said he had other items.’

As well as the teapot, the man’s collection included 140 rare photographs and four statuettes of Tibetan deities.

One of the statuettes went on to sell
at auction for £77,000 and another for £45,000, while the collection of
photographs fetched more than £12,000.

The £2,200 paid for the teapot was 
nearly 20 times the estimate at the programme’s evaluation day at 
Longleat House in Wiltshire.

Mr Aldridge said: ‘It was amazing. 
[The collection] is fresh for people who collect these things, because 
it has stayed in this chap’s family and no one has seen it.’

He added that the Younghusband 
expedition was ‘infamous’ because it was ‘effectively a temporary 
invasion by British Indian forces’.

The BBC said the £140,000 collection was a record for the programme.

The British Younghusband expedition to Tibet began in December 1903 and lasted until September 1904.

At the start of the 20th century the then viceroy of India Lord Curzon viewed Tibet as a threat to British interests.

Even herdsmen encroaching into the British border territories could provoke a diplomatic incident.

Fearing Tibet had decided on war with India, and were relying on support from Russia and the Chinese, Lord Curzon sent  an emissary to Lhasa to negotiate with the Dalai Lama.

In the summer of 1903 Colonel Francis Younghusband, with a military force of about 200 Sikhs, crossed the border. They waited in Khamba Jong for what they expected to be a large Tibetan and Chinese representation. 

The expedition fought its way through the country reaching the township of Guru where thousands of Tibetans walked as a mass into machine gun fire. It was a massacre.

Younghusband and his expedition entered the capital of Lhasa in August 1904. The Dalai Lama had fled to safety, first in Mongolia and then later in China.

A month later Younghusband signed an agreement that gave the British trading advantages and excluded, in theory, others from Tibet.
