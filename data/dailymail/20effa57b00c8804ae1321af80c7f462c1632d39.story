Belief: Mr Justice Peter Jackson (pictured) ruled the parents were not to blame for their daughter's death and 'deserved to be believed'

A father accused of suffocating his baby daughter by rolling onto her as they slept can be reunited with her twin after a judge ruled that the sister should not be removed by social services.

The 'intelligent' middle class father came under suspicion following the death of his 16-week-old daughter last year, with Lancashire County Council leading the case against him.

His dead daughter's identical twin sister was temporarily removed from the family home but following an in-depth inquiry, Mr Justice Peter Jackson has now cleared him of all blame.

Lancashire County Council pointed the finger at the father after social workers highlighted the fact that the twins' older sister - identified in court only as 'K' - had been taken to hospital with a serious head injury in 2011.

They argued that the father and the children's mother 'knew more than they were saying' about how 'K' suffered a fractured skull.

However,
 following an in-depth inquiry, Mr Justice Peter Jackson ruled that the 
parents were not responsible either for K's injury or the death of her 
little sister - identified as 'L'.

The judge ordered that both 'K', now aged three, and the surviving twin be restored to their parents' care.

Describing the couple as 'very close, intelligent, hard-working and aspirational', the judge said they were of good character and 'deserved to be believed'.

Social workers claimed that 'L' 'probably died as a result of her father lying on her when he was sleeping on the same sofa'.

It was suggested that the father had covered up the baby girl's 'accidental suffocation' by placing her in her rocker after her death.

The mother accepted that the twins' sleeping arrangements on the night of 'L''s death was 'not the greatest idea'.

But the couple otherwise disputed every part of the council's case during an eight-day High Court hearing.

The judge said a postmortem had recorded the cause of 'L''s death as 'unascertained'.

He accepted that the parents' account of what happened could not be 'accepted without question' and 'acknowledged the possibility that they have put their heads together to cover up a case of overlaying'.

However, he ruled: 'For the father to have placed 'L' in her rocker, knowing that she was moribund, and then gone to bed would be extremely out of character. There is no reliable evidence that he did this.

'My conclusion is that we simply do not know when or why 'L' died. Nor has it been proved that either of the parents knows.

'A finding against the parents would be based on speculation or suspicion, which would be impermissible and wrong.'

'The sleeping arrangements that were made for such small babies were obviously unwise, but that does not cross the threshold for intervention.'

The council insisted that one or both of the parents knew how 'K' was injured but that they were intent on 'concealing' the truth.

However, the judge said: 'With some hesitation I find that the parents' account of events can be accepted.

'I cannot conclude that it is more probable than not that they are concealing a known incident.'

The judge concluded: "I therefore find that the grounds for making care orders do not exist.

'In consequence, the children will return to the care of their parents.'
