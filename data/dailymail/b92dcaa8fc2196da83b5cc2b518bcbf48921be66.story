The white supremacist attempting to turn a small North Dakotan town into a ‘white enclave’ has undergone a DNA test which proves he is of Sub-Saharan African heritage, MailOnline can reveal.

Craig Cobb, 62, submitted to the test as part of The Trisha Show’s ongoing Race in America series and was given the results of the DNA Diagnostics test by the host, Trisha Goddard, to the whoops of her studio audience.

On hearing the results Cobb, who insists he is not a white supremacist but a Creator, a religion which favours ‘racial awareness’, immediately dismissed the news that genetically he is 14 per cent Sub Saharan African, 86 per cent European, as ‘statistical noise.’

White supremacist Craig Cobb tries to tune out the 'statistical noise' that reveals his genetic makeup is 86 per cent European and 14 per cent Sub-Saharan African

Enemy within: Cobbs recoils from TV talk show host Trisha Goddard's attempted 'fist bump' on learning that he has Sub-Saharan African DNA

'You've got a little black in you bro': Trisha moves in for a fist bump undeterred by her guest's evident reluctant to meet her hand or eye

If at first you don't succeed....Cobb will make sure you never do. Trisha is left hanging by her guest's refusal to make contact

He said: ‘I tell you. Oil and water don’t mix.’

With a fixed grin Cobb, a man who relies on a dizzying array of statistics to underpin his own agenda of racial discrimination and sexual intolerance, shook his head and tried to wave these ones away.

As the studio audience jeered and crowed in delight, Goddard insisted: ‘You have a little black in you.’

When the 55-year-old British host tried to fist bump her guest, with the words, ‘So there you go bro,’ Cobb visibly recoiled and twice refused to meet her touch.

Speaking to MailOnline Cobb said: 'I agreed to the test because I assumed it was science.' Instead, he said, it was a scientifically bankrupt procedure, the product of 'craven and debased executives,' whose 'goal is to shock.'

He said: 'When I told Jeff Schoep [leader of the National Socialism Movement] he just laughed.'

He described it as 'short science' used by a sensationalist television show to 'promote multiculturalism.'

When pressed over how he would feel if a test he respected were to show the presence of such DNA he said: 'Well if I did have any n**** we don't want anymore of it.'

He would, he said, consider himself a 'border guard for the pure breds.'

He explained: 'Keeping the peace if possible but if we have to fight, keeping the frontline in the war.'

Condemned: A sign raised by Craig Cobb in the trees above his land in Leith, North Dakota. The words Credo 64 refer to the 'White Man's Bible,' the so-called holy book for Creators - of which he is one

Followers of Cobb: Badge wearing member of the National Socialist Movement, Kynan Dutton, wife Deborah Dutton and their five children are the first family to move to Leith, N.D in an attempt to establish a white enclave

A look down Main Street in Leith, N.D. Many of its 16 residents had never even heard of white supremacy until its proponents tried to take over their town

War, or the threat of it, is what the residents of Leith fear, Cobb has brought to their doors.

His plans for the tiny North Dakotan 
town of Leith came to light earlier this summer. Then, amid a fury of 
local and national reaction, it emerged that the wild-haired eccentric 
who had been living in the town for more than a year, was a hate crimes 
fugitive who had quietly bought up lots of land with the intention of 
turning the community into a haven for white supremacists.

But now, after an immediate flurry of rallies and town meetings, residents fear they are powerless to halt the man whose plans they regard as ‘pure evil,' and who has put up a sign condemning their town as  'The Village of the Damned.'

Since his plans were exposed, they say, he has goaded and harassed them in an attempt to provoke them into violence and open the way for him to bring charges or a civil suit.

Leith's only black resident, Bobby Harper, is a member of the current town council. He says he is 'better' than Cobb but believes the situation can only get worse

Pushed to breaking point: Cobb has publicly blamed councilman Lee Cook, 49, for the murder of his own daughter - killed in 2000 by the then boyfriend of his ex-wife

Mayor Ryan Schock, mayor and lifelong resident of Leith, N.D., is frustrated with the actions of white nationalist Craig Cobb who moved to town with the plan to establish a white enclave and admits they may be out of options

The town’s only bi-racial couple Sherrill and Bobby Harper have come under particular pressure. Bobby is the only black man in town. A note pinned to the couple’s door recently read: ‘What are you doing “married” to a Negro?’ and demanded Sherill leave her husband and ‘join Mr Cobb’s movement.’

Two weeks ago Mr Cobb confronted the Harpers on The Trisha Show, demeaning their relationship with the words: ‘She has her pet you see.’

Speaking to MailOnline Mr Harper was philosophical and dignified. He said he was 'better' than Cobb but expressed his belief that the situation was 'going to get worse.'

In an interview with MailOnline Mr Cobb referred to African Americans as ‘jungle bunnies’ and ‘Orks’ and said that black people were: ‘Strolling biological early warning devices. They look bad, they sound bad and often times they smell bad.’

Sherill and Bobby Harper speaking from their home in Leith as the full extent of Cobb's plans became apparent. Their lives have been disrupted but they are determined to stand their ground

A grinning Craig Cobb walks near his home in Leith, ND, with a supporter and the flags that fly almost daily in the background. He wasn't smiling when he was told he was part Sub-Saharan African

In what he referred to as a ‘better world where we are in charge,’ he said that all black immigrants to America would be instructed on arrival: ‘If you try to have sex with our white handmaidens we will hang you.’

He used profoundly offensive racist and mysogynistic language saying he was 'very proud' to do so as he regarded the terms as 'holy words' enshrined in the 'White Man's Bible,' in which, as a Creator, he believes.

In a recent town meeting Cobb singled out Leith town councilman Lee Cook, 49, the founder of the town’s Legal Defense Fund established to pay for their fight against Cobb.

Leith, N.D. Sheriff Steve Bay, left, and deputy Darwin Roth talk near the entrance of the Leith townhall at a meeting last Sunday. But the town may have run out of legal options to stop Cobb's march.

One man's dream...a small town's nightmare: Flags of various organizations, some representing the National Socialist Movement, fly in front of the home of white nationalist Craig Cobb in Leith, N.D.

Thirteen years ago Mr Cook’s 17 year old daughter, Crystal was murdered by the then boyfriend of his ex-wife. Now remarried and with three children by second wife Heather, his move to Leith was, in part, a bid to escape the painful associations of the Washington town in which the murder took place.

Cobb suggested that Mr Cook was in some way responsible for his daughter’s death. According to Mr Cook: ‘He hoped to get me to beat him up so that he could sue me. He wants to look like the victim but this is all his doing.

‘It was an evil attempt by a demented individual to aggravate me.’

Today Mr Cook sleeps with a loaded by his side and has bought his wife a firearm.

In a desperate bit to prevent Cobb from fulfilling his dream in Leith, the town council have voted through a string or ordinances putting a moratorium on building, instituting standards of potable water and sewerage and prohibiting anyone living in a trailer on Leith land for more than 10 days straight. 

But ultimately, Mayor Ryan Schock, 38, admitted: ‘We don’t know what comes next.’

One family of White supremacists have already responded to Cobb’s call for followers and have moved into his ramshackle home on what passes for the town’s main street.

Kynan and Deborah Dutton, both 28, moved to Leith from Oregon on 23 September. Their five children aged between 11 and four are home-schooled by former teacher, Deborah.

Dutton, a Marine Corps veteran who served in the Iraq war in 2004 and 2005 is proud to call himself Cobb’s Sergeant in Arms. He puts flags, including that of the Third Reich, The National Socialist Movement, and one symbolising the right to bear arms, in front of Cobb’s home each day.

He takes them in at night because, he said: ‘The native Americans are notorious for coming and stealing them.’

With just 16 residents in the town Cobb is confident that his bid to outnumber the locals with his followers and take over the council will succeed.

He claims another family is on their way and has threatened to bring member of the ‘hard core Aryan Nations’ group to the town and ex-convicts who have ‘been in Federal prison for 20 years.’

He said: ‘We will become the majority there is no doubt. Do not ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for Leith.’
