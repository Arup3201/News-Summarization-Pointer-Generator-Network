Amid the latest furore over Manchester City’s spending, it is worth noting that Alexis Sanchez could have been walking out at the Etihad in blue on Sunday had the Premier League champions not been operating under tighter financial restrictions last summer.

When it became clear that Sanchez was leaving Barcelona, City manager Manuel Pellegrini considered entering the bidding for his Chilean compatriot.

It soon became clear, however, that the £30million fee agreed between Barcelona and Arsenal was too much for the reduced transfer budget imposed on City by UEFA.

The player also preferred a move to London, and the Premier League champions were unaware at that stage of the summer that one of their four strikers, Alvaro Negredo, would soon be returning to Spain for personal reasons.

Reflecting on the issue, Pellegrini said: ‘It wasn’t easy. He was a very expensive player in that moment. Barcelona sold him to Arsenal but I am sure Alexis can play everywhere.’

It was not the first time City had courted Sanchez.

In the summer of 2011, he was even higher on Roberto Mancini’s list of transfer targets than Sergio Aguero when Udinese decided to cash in on their prize asset. Contact was made between City and the player’s camp but Sanchez had set his heart on joining Barcelona.

‘When they stopped picking up the phone or returning calls, we knew we’d lost him,’ said a club source.

Realising that Juventus were circling around Aguero, City moved quickly to avoid missing out on their other leading target and agreed a £38m fee with Atletico Madrid to sign the Argentine.

Aguero is ‘100 per cent fit’ after a knee injury, according to Pellegrini, and the shootout between him and Sanchez will be the highlight of Sunday’s clash between City and Arsenal at the Etihad — a fixture that produced a thrilling 6-3 win for the home team last season.

Comparisons between them have dominated the build-up to the game, but the City boss was reluctant to indulge in such an exercise.

‘I don’t want to compare him with Sergio,’ added Pellegrini. ‘I think Alexis is a very good player, he is having a very good season in England.

‘It is not easy for a player in his first season here to score so many goals.

‘Alexis is repeating what he did in the last two seasons at Barcelona and scoring a lot. I am very happy for him because he is a very enthusiastic young player and improving.

‘It is not the first year from Alexis here in Europe. He had eight or nine years when he was very young in Italy with Udinese and then returned on loan to South America. He played really well in Barcelona and now in England. The football fans in Chile are very happy for him and for the country.’

On the expectations for the clash with Arsenal, he added: ‘It is difficult to score six and three goals again, but I think for fans it will be a very attractive game.

‘I hope we can score the same amount of goals, and Arsenal have more problems to score three.’

City will be without one of their key players after it emerged that Samir Nasri will miss the game against his old club with a calf injury that is expected to keep him out of action for up to a month.

The French midfielder is set to miss four Premier League games and the FA Cup fourth round tie against Middlesbrough, but should be back to face Barcelona in the Champions League first knockout round on February 24. 

There was more troubling news for Pellegrini when Yaya Toure once again cast doubt over his future at the club in an interview at the Africa Cup of Nations.

Toure and his agent caused a bizarre issue last summer by hitting out at City for failing to acknowledge the midfielder’s 31st birthday with a cake and, allegedly, grant him compassionate leave to see his dying brother Ibrahim. Speaking to CNN World Sport at the Ivory Coast camp in Equatorial Guinea, where he is on international duty with City’s new £25m signing Wilfried Bony, Toure reflected on ‘a horrible year’ and once again refused to commit his future to the club.

Asked if he will be at the Etihad next season, he replied: ‘I don’t know. I’m at City at the moment.

‘That’s a big question and that’s an easy question as well, and you have an easy answer — we’ll see.’

Toure’s £250,000-a-week deal at City runs until 2017 and Pellegrini was quick to dismiss concerns that he will be going anywhere soon despite comparisons with his latest comments and the birthday cake fiasco.

‘You can’t link one thing with the other,’ said the City boss. ‘I repeat, Yaya is very happy here. His commitment with our club is not a problem. We have to play two more games without Yaya and he will arrive here in February.

‘He’s a very important player for us, but I don’t think our team depends just on one player.’
