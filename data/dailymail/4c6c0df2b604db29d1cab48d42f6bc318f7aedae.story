For Tony Jacklin, becoming the first British winner of the US Open in 46 years was just one of the great outcomes from his stunning seven-shot success back in 1970.

The second was the friendship that blossomed with the man who presided over his bag for those four golden days at Hazeltine Golf Club.

‘One of the sweetest things of it all was the $3,000 that I gave my caddie, Tom Murphy’, said Jacklin.

Throwback: He was the first Englishman to do so since Jacklin himself in 1970

‘Yes, I did leave my cheque in my trousers and it went off to the dry cleaners.

‘But they sent me a new one and I gave Tom 10 per cent of my $30,000 winnings. It put him through college.

‘He was 19 at the time. He went on to become a multi-millionaire who owned golf courses and sports bars and all sorts. And even at 63, he remembered every shot I hit.

‘So, apart from winning the US Open, the nicest thing is that Tom made a fantastic success of his life too.’

Sadly, Murphy passed away during his sleep at his American home at the end of last month.

This year’s edition at Pinehurst will no doubt prove an emotional time for legend Jacklin, Europe’s most-celebrated European Ryder Cup captain of all-time, with reminders of his sensational triumph and the man who was there alongside him.

‘He’ll be missed by a lot of people,’ the 1969 Open champion recently told Reuters in a telephone interview, just two weeks after speaking exclusively to Sportsmail at the OnlineGolf.co.uk golf day at Thorndon Park in Essex.

‘Tom touched a lot of lives and was a sweetheart of a guy.’

Hordes: Jacklin is mobbed by fans after victory over the USA in the Ryder Cup at Muirfield Village, Ohio, USA, in 1987.

Having won two majors and three Ryder Cups, Jacklin is royalty in British golfing terms.

And he was delighted to see Justin Rose end a long, 43-year wait and add his name to the coveted list of winners when he triumphed so spectacularly at Merion 12 months ago.

‘I was thrilled for Justin. I contacted him immediately. I know the feeling and it had been a long time (since an English player won it).

‘It was a long time before I won it and a long time after, so it was really great. He’s a great guy and I was delighted for him. He held it together beautifully.’

So does Jacklin believe Rose, 33, will go one better than he managed and successfully defend his title come Sunday evening?

‘It’s a tough championship to defend,’ he said.

‘There’s expectation and everyone’s monitoring how you’re doing. There’s  a lot of pressure going into it.

‘And a lot of it is down to whether the course suits you.

‘I defended at Merion where Justin won his, ironically. Unfortunately, I didn’t do a very good job of it. The course was very narrow and I never got to grips with the way to play it really.

‘But in Justin’s case, he has established himself as a world star now in the top 10 and playing steady golf, so there’s no reason why he can’t do a good job this year.

‘It’s a tall order. People wonder why there was a such a gap from when I won it to Justin’s success last year. And he certainly has a chance.’

Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell will be among the British contingent hoping to stake their claim in North Carolina this week.

The Northern Irishmen took the honours in 2011 and, the latter, a year beforehand in 2010.

But Jacklin, who led from start to finish when he celebrated glory in Minnesota over four decades ago, believes the opening round will be the key to the eventual winner on a tough Pinehurst track.

‘Who knows who will win it?’ said the 69-year-old, who now resides in Florida.

‘All of these predications we try to make is a lot of hot air. Until you get through the first round, a lot of people underestimate the importance of it. You can’t win it after the first round but you can lose it.

‘More important for the great players, if they get a good first round on the board, If they are in the first three, they get mentally engaged and they know that they are of that pedigree that they can win.

‘Sometimes though we tend to forget that, at this level, it’s a mind game. Purely, and simply.

Without Tiger Woods, who remains sidelined by a back injury to miss his second major tournament of the year after his absence at Augusta, Jacklin believes there is a real opportunity for the rest of the field.

‘There will be some shocks,’ he said.

‘There always is. Surprise characters crop up in majors and sometimes they can take the lead early on.

‘Everyone wants Tiger to get better. He’ll be missed by the fans. There’s no question over his impact on the game over the last 15 years or so. But he’s still just one player.

Whoever does go on to emulate his US Open feat, Jacklin insists they will face the most stringent of examinations from what is arguably the most difficult major to land.

‘I honestly think the US Open is the supreme test,’ he said.

‘It’s the supreme examination because it allows the USGA to set the course up on the edge.

‘At The Open you can’t do much - weather-wise you’ve got to keep the greens and pin placements reasonable. But at the US Open they can take it to the limit with pin positions and green speeds. So, it’s not just a test of golf, it’s a test of patience and a lot of things.

‘There’ll be guys this year who will hit shots at Pinehurst that deserve birdies. But they might come off with bogeys or worse sometimes. It’s swallowing that and moving on that the US Open is as much about than anything.

‘It’s no good going in thinking, “That’s not fair”. It’s just how it is. So, whoever comes out winning will have dealt with all the necessary obstacles.

‘Pinehurst with the false fronts, lots of undulation and pin placement that goads guys into going for them. The ball can run off and you might end up 40 yards away after hitting what appeared to be a good ball.

‘Of course, winning The Open was the one I always wanted to win because it’s my home country’s major and it is the oldest. But there’s no doubt in my mind that the US Open is the hardest. They take it to courses that they can set on the edge. They like to watch the guys suffer!’
