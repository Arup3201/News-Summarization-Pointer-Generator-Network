Hollyoaks actor Thomas Scurr suffered a broken cheek bone and a fractured eye socket after an unprovoked attack in the early hours.

The 22-year-old, who plays aristocratic student Barney Harper-McBride in the Channel 4 soap, and his friend James Conway were crossing the northern side of the square at around 2.30am on Saturday May 11 when they were approached by an unknown suspect who punched Mr Scurr in the face.

Westminster police are appealing for information to trace the suspect, who is described as a white with a shaven head, 6ft tall and stocky. He was with a female with shoulder-length brown hair.

Victim: Hollyoaks star Thomas Scurr severed severe facial injuries after a man punched him to the floor in an unprovoked attack in Leicester Square at around 2.30am

Investigating officer, Detective Sergeant Nathan Tozer, said: 'This was a nasty and completely unprovoked attack, which resulted in Mr Scurr sustaining serious injuries to his face, and I am keen to identify the person responsible.

'I am really hoping that members of the public who were in the area at the time may be able to help us with our enquiries.

'We know that prior to the incident several people identified Mr Scurr and Mr Conway and asked them to pose for photos, and I am keen to hear from anyone who was in the area and may have taken pictures of the pair on their phone, or noticed the incident taking place.'
