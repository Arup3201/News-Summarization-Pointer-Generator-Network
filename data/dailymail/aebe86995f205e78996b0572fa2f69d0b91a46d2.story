Millions of barren patches of land, known as ‘fairy circles’, can be found across the Namib Desert in southern Africa. 

The mystery of how they got there, or why they stay there, has stumped scientists for decades.

Theories have included grass-killing gas, termites and even UFOs while local myth holds that a fire-breathing dragon lives beneath the Earth and burns the vegetation.

But these strange patterns may in fact be the result of underground competition for resources among plants, according to new research by Michael Cramer at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.

Fairy circles, which can be 2-12m in diameter, are found in the region’s arid grassland on sandy soils. A ring of vegetation that is taller than the grassland usually surrounds the barren patch.

The theory states that the nutrient-poor soil and lack of rainfall causes increased competition between plants in the Namib Desert.

The stronger types of grass soak up all the nutrients causing other plants in the area to die. 

This leaves a barren patch in the landscape which later becomes a reservoir for nutrients and water.

Fairy circles are barren patches of land which can be found across the Namib Desert in southern Africa.

myth holds that a dragon lives beneath the Earth and his fiery breath 
burns the vegetation. 

‘The consequent barren circle may provide a resource-reservoir essential for the survival of the larger peripheral grasses,’ said the researchers, writing in the journal PLOS ONE.

‘It's a really good theory because it accounts for all the characteristics of fairy circles,’ Florida State University biologist Walter Tschinkel, who was not involved in the study, told LiveScience. 

‘No other proposed cause for fairy circles has ever done that.’

In April Norbert Jürgens from the University of Hamburg claimed that a species of sand termite was responsible for the patterns.

He examined hundreds of fairy circles in more than 1,200 miles of the desert and found that the Psammotermes allocerus, or sand termite, was the only species consistently present.

Mr Jürgens theory states that they eat plant roots before they can sprout through the desert soil creating a water trap - in a similar way that beavers create dams.

Because of the lack of foliage, rainwater is not lost through transpiration (the evaporation of water from plants) and instead stays below the surface.

This allows the sand termites to survive and stay active during the dry season and also helps grasses at the edge of the circle to thrive attracting other life forms.

The termites feed on those grasses, thereby gradually extending the circle.

Mr Jürgens concluded that the fairy circles are actually an astounding example of ecological engineering by the sand termite, designed to retain precious water in an otherwise arid landscape.

Mr Cramer, lead researcher of the current study, has dismissed the termite theory. 

‘I think the major hurdle that explanations have to overcome is explaining the regular spacing of the circles, their approximate circularity and their size,’ Mr Cramer told LiveScience. 

‘There's no real reason why termites would produce such large circles that are so evenly spaced.’

The current theory is backed up by previous research in which mathematical models show that the vegetation pattern of fairy circles could depend on water availability.

Fairy circles are circular, barren patches of land that are found in the Namib Desert of southern Africa and are steeped in mythology

Latest theory suggests they are caused by plants competing for nutrients

Stronger types of grass soak up nutrients leaving the weaker ones to die
