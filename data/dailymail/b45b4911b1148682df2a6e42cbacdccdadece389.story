Transgender DJ: Billy-Joe Newington, 25, is set to have new genitalia made using the skin on his tattooed arm - leaving him with a tribal-print penis

A transgender DJ is set to have new genitalia made using the skin on his tattooed arm - leaving him with a tribal-print penis.

Billy-Joe Newington, 25, from Cardiff, was born as a girl called Connie, but has been desperate to be a boy since the age of four.

He started taking male hormones more than two years ago, quickly transforming him from a size-eight girl into a muscular man with stubble.

He had a double mastectomy in January after years of binding his 32C breasts and is booked in for his first ‘lower-half’ taxpayer-funded NHS operation later this year.

But the skin for his new penis will have to come from his left forearm, which is currently covered in a ten-inch black tribal tattoo with red stars.

Skin is taken from the arm in such 
operations because it is smooth and hairless.

In Mr Newington's case, it will have to be taken 
from his left forearm because the procedure can cause paralysis 
and he is right-handed.

Today, the DJ and his fiancée Celyn Phillips, 31, said his new patterned manhood would enable him to transform into the man they feel he was always meant to be.

'When I was a teenager I was living with double feelings - this is how I feel and this is how society wants me to be,' said Mr Newington.

'I tried to fight against it, I tried the whole make up thing, the long hair and the straighteners but it wasn’t me. Once I had the top half operation I instantly felt like I could finally be me.

'I’m looking forward to the lower half, but the closer it gets the more nervous I get. I’m already living the life of a man, but this will be the final step.

'The
 most common place they take the skin from for the phalloplasty is the 
forearm, but my whole left arm is covered in a tribal tattoo.'

'I tried to fight it, but it wasn't me': Mr Newington was born as a girl called Connie, but has been desperate to be a boy since the age of four. Above, he is pictured aged 18 at home, the day before having his long hair cut off

Mr Newington said he realised he was different from 'other boys' at an early age. When he got to school, he hoped he would grow out of his feelings and even forced himself to dress more 'girly'.

But after cutting off all his hair, when he was 15 he finally plucked up the courage to tell his doctor how he was feeling - who told him he was transgender.

After his diagnosis, Mr Newington came out to his family, changed his name and started dressing as a man full-time

He was working as an openly-transgender DJ at a
 club in Bristol when he met Miss Phillips, a lighting engineer, who 
instantly accepted him for who he was.

Man made: The DJ said his new manhood would enable him to transform into the man he always felt he was

'Things started to feel really odd when I was a teenager. I knew I was attracted to women, but what confused me the most was I looked at men and thought ‘they look pretty good,' said Mr Newington.

'It was working out the difference between envying men and fancying women that was confusing.

'When I met Celyn she knew straight away about me. I told her that I loved her pretty quickly, and she said to me "I can't say that I love you just yet, but I know that I when I do I will love you for the person you are, not the gender".

'Her saying that meant the world to me. To her, I am the man I know I am.'

Mr Newington started taking testosterone in January 2012 and two years later, had his breasts removed in a £6,000 NHS op at New Victoria Hospital in Surrey.

During the three-hour operation, surgeons removed a cancerous lump, and after six weeks of being wrapped in bandages, Mr Newington was able to go topless for the first time.

He had a pre-op appointment for his £12,000 lower half surgery on Wednesday and will have the first of three penis operations in the coming months.

'The first operation is to make the body
 of the penis, then the second will be to make the head and have the 
testicle implants, and the third will be a urethral lengthening and a 
hysterectomy,' said Mr Newington.

Couple: Mr Newington was working as an openly-transgender DJ at a club in Bristol when he met his fiancée Celyn Phillips, 29, a lighting engineer, who instantly accepted him for who he was. Above, the couple in 2012

'The first thing people ask is will you be able to ejaculate, and the answer to that is no. I will still be able to achieve orgasm. If I couldn’t, I would not be able to go through with it. It’s important, but not that important.

'I will be able to get an erection though, because there are things they can put in it.

'I could have one where they put a thing
 that looks like a straw that you pump full of air with a pump in your 
testicle.

'Or I could have a flexible iron rod that gets stiff when you 
have a chemical injection.

Looking to the future: Mr Newington (pictured at his home in Cardiff) said he and Miss Philips plan to get married after his first penis operation, and hope to have children in the future with the help of a sperm donor

He added: 'I’m a bit more nervous about this operation than the last one, because I thought it was going to be easy but it was actually emotionally draining, but Celyn is supporting me and keeping me calm.'

Mr Newington said he and Miss Philips plan to get married after his first penis operation.

They also hope to have children in the future with the help of a sperm donor.
