It's that awkward moment when you are forced to have a meeting with someone who you tried to force out of a job.

David Cameron today grimaced his way through his first formal talks with Jean-Claude Juncker after failing to block his appointment as European Commission President.

The two men posed for a photograph where Mr Juncker did not even look at the camera, and the pair were later pictured trying - and failing - to high-five each other, which was quickly mocked online.

Great mates: David Cameron and Jean-Claude Juncker attempt a bizarre high-five at a meeting in Brussels

Mr Cameron's official spokesman said Mr Juncker makes a habit of welcoming people with a high-five

The attempt at public displays of bonhomie were not entirely successful, and did little to disguise the tensions between the two men.

Mr Cameron was so bitterly opposed to Mr Juncker taking the top Brussels job that he forced an unprecedented vote on it. Only Hungary joined Mr Cameron in voting against his appointment.

Now, the Prime Minister has been forced to pretend the whole thing never happened, and insist he can still work with the former Luxembourg premier.

Their face-to-face encounter in Brussels today comes after Mr Cameron made a difficult phone call to congratulate Mr Junker in his success in taking the job he tried to block.

'The Prime Minister congratulated Mr Juncker on running a successful campaign and securing the Council nomination,' Downing Street said in a statement last month issued through gritted teeth. 

Mr Juncker, a fixture in EU politics for decades and architect of the eurozone, has insisted that descriptions of him as an arch-federalist are overblown.

Downing Street played down the significance of the photographs today, insisting Mr Juncker greets lots of people with a high-five. 

Mr Cameron's officials spokesman said: 'As I understand it, it is how Mr Juncker greets quite a lot of people.

'They know each other quite well, of course, because they sat around the EU table when he was Prime Minister of Luxembourg.'

However, the display of mock playfulness became the subject of internet parodies and ridicule online.

He has also stressed he is not in principle opposed to the UK repatriating some powers from Brussels - a key demand of Mr Cameron in the run-up to an in/out referendum mooted for 2017.

However, he has said the free movement of labour within the union is not up for grabs, and risked the wrath of Eurosceptics by lavishing praise on one of their hate figures - former commission head Jacques Delors.

Mr Cameron's surprise decision to put Lord Hill forward to represent Britain has been branded a 'shambles' after the peer had to sell shares in a lobbying firm to avoid criticism over conflicts of interest.

He acted to head off concerns over his significant holding in £140 million global public affairs company Huntsworth, which operates in Brussels.

MEPs had warned that they would be looking closely at the interest in deciding whether to confirm his appointment.

President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz also suggested that he could be rejected for being too Eurosceptic - although he later backtracked and insisted he would be treated fairly at confirmation hearings.

Number 10 pointed out that the European Parliament has the opportunity to approve or reject a new commission 'as a whole, as a slate, not as individuals'.

Lord Hill told journalists in Brussels that he would not view himself as a Eurosceptic.

'I'm not a great one for looking for names or badges or boxes,' he said.

Lord Hill previously replied 'non, non, non' when asked if he wanted the EU job - but said last night: 'I am not a reluctant conscript. It is true that I loved my time at the House of Lords, which is a fantastic institution, full of wonderful people.

'The fact is, having thought about the importance of this job, the pivotal role that it will play, the crucial time in the history of the European Union and also of Britain, it is a fantastic opportunity to be involved and I would be mad not to do it.'

During talks last night, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared to cower as Mr Cameron was talking to Portugal's Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho

EU leaders last night put off decisions on commissioners and portfolios for a few weeks, with an impasse between Germany and Italy being blamed.

Each of the 28 member states nominates someone to serve in a post for a four-year term, with Luxembourg's spot already taken up by Mr Juncker.

Britain's current commissioner, Baroness Ashton, has a senior role as High Representative, which means that brief will go elsewhere this time round.

The summit also failed to agree a president of the European Council to succeed Herman Van Rompuy - a position for which Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt, wife of Neil Kinnock's son Stephen, is thought to be in the running.
