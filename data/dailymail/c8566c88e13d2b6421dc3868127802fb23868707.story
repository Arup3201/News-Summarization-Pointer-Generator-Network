Striker Loic Remy (groin) and midfielder John Obi Mikel (foot) are out, but Ramires is back from a groin problem to bolster the midfield.

QPR 

Harry Redknapp could call upon QPR's misfit midfielder Adel Taarabt for Saturday's trip to Chelsea after the duo patched up their public spat.

The Rangers boss has refused to rule out pitching the Morocco playmaker back into action with Jordon Mutch and Joey Barton not back in full training until next week following hamstring problems.

Taarabt has apologised to Redknapp after biting back when his manager branded him 'about three stone overweight'.

Provisional squad: Green, McCarthy, Traore, Dunne, Caulker, Yun, Hill, Isla, Henry, Sandro, Fer, Taarabt, Zamora, Vargas, Austin, Phillips, Kranjcar, Murphy, Hoilett.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Chelsea have failed to score in three of the last four Premier League games against west London rivals QPR.

QPR’s last visit to Stamford Bridge saw QPR win 1-0 thanks to former Blues player Shaun Wright-Phillips (January 2013).

Cesc Fabregas has been involved in nine goals (one goal, eight assists) in nine league games for Chelsea.

Queens Park Rangers have won just one of their last 18 away trips to rival London clubs in the Premier League (D3 L14).

Harry Redknapp has lost just one of his last six Premier League clashes with Chelsea (W2 D3).

Shaun Wright-Phillips (third right) stunned former club Chelsea when he scored the only goal in a 1-0 victory for QPR the last time the teams met at Stamford Bridge in January last year

However, he has seen his teams lose all five league clashes with Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea.

In their last 12 league matches at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea have kept 10 clean sheets and conceded just four goals in total.

The last time a side in the Premier League relegation zone went to the home of the league leaders and won was September 2001 (Southampton beating Sam Allardyce’s Bolton 1-0). Since then, the league leaders have won 24 of their 26 home matches against a side in the relegation zone (D2).

Charlie Austin has scored 23 league goals for QPR since the beginning of last season (incl. play-offs); 17 more than any other player (Ravel Morrison – 6).

Steven Caulker is the only QPR player to have started every league game so far this season. By contrast, seven of Chelsea’s players have started each and every Premier League game so far; a joint-league high with Southampton.
