Tony Abbott's sister says the Prime Minister was the most supportive of their family when she left her husband of 20 years after falling in love with a woman despite him not supporting same-sex marriage.

Christine Forster had what looked like the 'perfectly happy suburban marriage' with four beautiful children until she met Virginia Edwards in 2003 when their sons went to the same school.

'I grew up in an environment where there was never any opportunity from me to pursue a same sex relationship - it wasn't something that was ever even considered remotely, she said on The Feed. 

'But as soon as I met Virginia I knew she was somebody I was attracted to.'

The City of Sydney councillor is a staunch member of the Liberal party and may soon enter NSW politics herself but does support marriage equality unlike her beloved brother.

Despite Mr Abbott's strong traditional beliefs about marriage he is accepting of his sister's relationship with Virginia Edwards.

'Tony was, out of all of my immediate family members, the most supportive - people raise my eyebrows when I say this but it is the honest truth,' she said.

'When I told him what was going on his response was "what ever you think you have to do I will support you".' 

Virginia said she has never been treated as an outcast in the Abbott household.

'Outwardly and from the love he has shown me - he certainly hasn't made me feel as if I'm not welcome and I'm not loved,' she said.

However, this does not mean that the couple are happy about Mr Abbott's stance on marriage equality.

'Of course it hurts and that's why Christine and I stood our ground,' Virginia said.

'I think he's wrong but he's entitled to his view and it would be great if he turned around tomorrow and said "I've had a change of heart",' Christine added.

Christine was also quick to defend her brother's view on the divisive issue.

'He's not saying that he doesn't see my relationship with Virginia as valid,' she said.

'He's just saying that he doesn't believe that we should come under this umbrella of the institution of marriage because as he sees marriage.... he sees it as that it has to be between a man and a woman.'

Although the women accept Mr Abbott's stance on gay marriage they hope he will one day change his mind

This is not to say if same-sex marriage was passed as a law that Mr Abbott wouldn't attend a wedding for the couple.

'He may not want it to be legalised but if it were he has told us he would be at our marriage,' Virginia said.

And Mr Abbott playing a pivotal role within the ceremony has also not been ruled out 

'Page boy Tony - I don't know maybe - we will see him in a little blue velvet cap, we'll wait and see,' Virginia said.

Both women are the first to admit that it was not an easy decision to completely turn their worlds upside down to be together.

'We were both married and that meant we had to make very difficult decisions about our relationships of course with our ex-husbands and also about what that meant for our children - it's indescribably difficult,' Christine said.

'To suddenly kind of dump on people who haven't gone through the inner process that you've gone through that "hey guys I'm really sorry but this it not how it works for me" is a terrible thing.'

Virginia said coming out is a big step whether you're a LLL - a late life lesbian - or a WLL - a whole life lesbian.

'I was terrified I couldn't imagine how I was going to manage the outfall of emotion that was going to come with this decision and the hurt,' she said.

'But I knew the love that I had for Christine was something that I couldn't live without.'

The couple say they'd consider Mr Abbott as their page boy in a blue velvet cap if they got married one day
